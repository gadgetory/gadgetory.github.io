enhance and heads look at his wrist
nobody walks with their arms pronated

logitech's MX series of flagship mice
including the full-featured
MX master 2's travel-friendly MX
anywhere 2 s and NX or go for trackball
enthusiasts now has a new addition to
the mischief that the mischief really a
group of mice is called a mischief well
you learn something every day ok anyway
it's the MX vertical Logitech's first
vertical Mouse now the idea behind
vertical mice which have been around for
anion 20 years now is to maximize
comfort and avoid carpal tunnel syndrome
and other repetitive strain injuries
that can be caused by lying your hand
flat for long periods of time this is
known as pronation and actually causes
your two forearm bones the radius and
the ulna to scissor which can pinch the
tissue inside the forearm increasing
pressure in the carpal tunnel
it can also inflamed tendons so yes
that's right folks going prone sometimes
hurts more than it helps now the index
verticals design mitigates this by
putting your hand in more of a natural
handshake position of 57 degrees which
is higher than the MX argoes optional
tilt but still less than the 90 degrees
which in theory would give you enhanced
unseeing but then would also introduce
new problems because instead of driving
mouse clicks down towards the desk
they'd be going sideways where there's
nothing to push against so you just push
your mouse way I mean you'd probably end
up with an injury from squeezing the
mouse constantly to try to hold it still
instead of being able to relax which is
what the verticals angle and wide thumb
pad do allow for okay so your arm bones
are aligned and all that but what is
this thing like to use honestly quite a
bit weirder than I thought and there's
definitely a bit of a learning curve
before you can point with the degree of
accuracy that you're probably used to
because you have to learn to move your
arm on a totally different axis now on a
normal
mouse most of us execute big movements
by pivoting from the elbow or from the
shoulder and then fine movements by
moving the wrist sideways a little bit
like this but while this does offer a
lot of precision it's actually an
unhealthy movement with another fancy
name all in there deviation but with the
vertical you actually do your fine
movements like this which becomes second
nature after a week or two except for an
unexpected problem that James who I
immediately unloaded this thing to when
it arrived ran into which was a
frustrating increase in what we're
calling fake clicks where you go to
click on something and nothing happens
causing you to have to click again so it
took me a couple of goes to figure out
why it wasn't registering sometimes and
it turns out that whether it's some
combination of the vertical position or
maybe the difference in fine motor
control between moving your hand like
this versus like this but basically
what's going on is that it's really easy
to invert enly click before you've
actually stopped moving the mouse and if
you look closely you can actually see
that the mouse is basically registering
a tiny micro drag instead of a discrete
click now it's possible that the main
factor in all this is just that we have
so much practice using horizontal like
regular mice and that this could be a
complete non-issue over time or it's
possible that you don't experience this
issue at all and it's just a James thing
but all we can do is tell you our
experiences and this is what I
experienced so there is one thing we
expect to be agreeable to everyone
though is the MX verticals looks
despite Logitech's obvious focus on
ergonomics the mouse itself still
manages to look frankly like a work of
art it looks like a seashell or ax or a
sailboat or like a a sick jump
but even seemingly design focused
decisions here often have practical
elements to them so the soft touch
rubber top for example is accented with
these vertical ribs that play with the
light more than the graphite color
otherwise wood but also give it a please
grippy texture in the hand so you can't
accidentally slip
unfortunately this mouse doesn't exist
in a vacuum and comparison is the thief
of joy so when we bring other mice into
the picture the MX vertical loses some
of its luster even though the MX
vertical is lightweight and advertised
as having the elevated performance of
the MX series and even though it has
forward and back buttons a dpi selector
that goes up to 4000 dpi and left and
right buttons that are rated to 10
million clicks it still feels like it
got a little shafted in terms of
features compared to its siblings
so despite demanding the same 99 US
dollar price the vertical has the fewest
programmable buttons it lacks a
horizontal scroll wheel and gesture
control and dark field tracking for use
on highly reflective surfaces and while
I understand that the angle of the mouse
might have restricted Logitech from
putting one of their awesome hyper
scrolling wheels on here I feel like at
least a tilt wheel probably wasn't too
much to ask honestly other than
ergonomics the only thing about this
Mouse that makes it stand out against
the others in the lineup is the fact
that it uses USB type-c so you get the
reversibility and the improvements to
durability not to mention that it will
be handy to be able to use the same
cable to charge your laptop your Android
phone and your mouse but James and I
actually had a pretty good debate about
this and we were going through this you
could make the argument that some of
those missing features that we mentioned
before would be more important to many
users than the type of USB port in spite
of all of that criticism though I can't
think of any reason to hate this Mouse
even if it was clearly built for folks
with medium to large hands the forward
button is a bit of a top shelf in the
kitchen kind of experience for a smaller
person like me it is expensive but it's
a high-quality right-handed Mouse with
modern Logitech benefits like dual
connectivity via radio and bluetooth
flow across multiple machines and
this neat graphical dpi selector which
unfortunately didn't work until I
installed Logitech's options software so
so if you're looking for a vertical
Mouse to help you prevent or recover
from a repetitive strain injury and you
don't mind spending three to five times
as much as the competitive offerings in
exchange for the logitech pedigree then
we can easily recommend it just don't
try to game with it because it gets
pretty warm actually all that surface
area private Internet access is the way
to be successfully protected on the
Internet P ia has clients available for
Windows Mac Linux Chrome they've got
like more coming in the future and it's
the VPN that hides your true identity
behind a protected fake IP address
allowing you to get behind censorship
and enjoy content that is otherwise
going to be geo blocked like if you want
to watch the BBC from somewhere else you
can even use a VPN like P ia to save
money on flights you can check out the
video that we're gonna have coming about
that very very soon and if you want to
hook yourself up with P ia today check
them out at the link in the video
description they've got over a thousand
servers in 28 countries giving them
fantastic coverage regardless of where
you want to appear as though you are
using the internet from so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
look not like this one but there are
