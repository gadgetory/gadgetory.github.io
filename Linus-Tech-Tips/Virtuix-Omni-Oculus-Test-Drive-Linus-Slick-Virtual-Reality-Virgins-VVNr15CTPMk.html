Corsair Vengeance k70 and k95 these
fully mechanical keyboards are designed
for performance gaming visit Corsair
comm slash Vengeance gaming to learn
more so this video will be a bit of a
bit of a blog style of the first time
for both me and slick with the Omni by
virtue X so guys feel free to come along
for the ride so the first thing is you
want to get kitted up with the
appropriate Footwear so I I was very
disappointed when I didn't get to where
the the moccasins that the unit was
demoed with but I got some stylish
converse shoes which I don't think I've
seen anything like in at least 10 years
at least not on people's feet but if
you've got the special felt on the toes
and then you've got the the slippy parts
on the on the rest of the bottom of the
shoe and then once you're once you're in
the shoes I get it getting into the
getting into the device can be a bit of
a trip so to speak well more about more
of a more of a slip you want to be
really careful support yourself on the
ring because if you don't then you might
accidentally give a heart attack to the
to the creator of the omni while you out
while you get into the device whoa no
I'm just kidding but there's a bit of
that there's a bit of an orientation
process so even once you're in there you
want to kind of put some weight on the
ring and take really small steps now
this is before the Kinect is involved
this is before you put any kind of other
VR device on anything like that you
don't want to put the oculus on before
you've actually practiced a few steps
but honestly I got it pretty quickly it
was quoted that you need about 10 to 15
minutes before you kind of get the hang
of it and I'd say by the time I was done
playing the game I probably had 10 or 15
minutes on it and it was feeling much
more natural already compared to when I
first got on but the the slipperiness of
part of your feet and the and the grip
enos of part of them doesn't feel quite
right unless unless you're you're moving
or you're standing but not really
anywhere in between if you're standing
like
talking to people around the device then
it's gonna be a little bit unnatural now
one thing that I noticed immediately is
that I wanted a little bit more grip on
the toes but it looks like it may be
possible to fine-tune that with
different felts and and things like that
so next up you put on the belt which has
a strap in the middle that I think I'm
gonna call the crotch crusher because I
I mean that the design is totally not
final and hopefully it'll be something
more like a climbing belt where there's
like two straps in a V rather than like
one thick or you know that holds you up
but it's important to have the belt
tight because what you'll find what I
found myself doing at least as a noob
with it is putting a little bit of
weight on the ring as I move myself
forward whereas I think once with a
little bit more practice I could avoid
putting so much weight on it and I
wouldn't need the belt nearly as much
actually slick will be going straight on
to it with no belt so that'll be that'll
be interesting stay tuned for that the
Kinect judges how fast you move by how
quickly your legs travel so you could
cheat the system by just kind of taking
your feet and going like this in all
likelihood but that's not really the
point I mean I see this as not only a
device that makes the game more
immersive but I see it as also a way to
you know put your pedometer on and go
for a bit of a walk go for a brisk
stroll heck go for a run because once I
spend a little bit of time on it I was
able to take much bigger steps and move
at a much faster pace without without
just kind of gaming it so then next up
is you put on the oculus so now you're
open o next up yeah the blunts the belts
on next step is you put on the oculus
and then you want to calibrate the
Kinect so make sure it's only picking up
you because if other people are in the
field of view you're gonna have some
issues where you know your guy might
just keep running because someone else
is moving around in the room then you
hold the gun now for me where this is
really going to come to life is when the
gun aiming is decoupled from looking is
decoupled from moving because right now
I was able to do it I was able to kill
dudes and get through the level but what
you have to do is you you could actually
walk in one direction and look like this
to go around corners but what I want is
to be able to walk around the corner but
moving my body around so with like a
wire
oculis this will be a very immersive
experience I had no idea especially the
first time I had no idea where I was
looking in the room once I actually took
the oculus off because of how immersed
in the gameplay experience I was one
thing that I made a mistake I didn't
think the oculus was stereo 3d the first
time I was playing with it it's kind of
low res it's a developer kit and all
that kind of stuff but but once things
are higher res and you can actually
adjust the depth of the picture it
hadn't been adjusted it was quite flat
then the sky is pretty much the limit on
this now this is the first time that
I've tried virtual reality since random
like low res crappy game at play tiem
and let me tell you it has come a long
way and with that one basically you just
like stood there and like looked and it
was like a shooting range it was like
skeet shooting but this is totally
different now we're playing an actual
triple-a title where instead of being
impressed by half-life 2's ragdoll
physics for impressed by the ability
that we get to walk around in this game
environment shooting things and it's
just totally totally totally totally
different I think that's pretty much it
for me so slicks up next alright so my
use case was kind of withdrawn I guess a
little bit because I had to use shoes
that were much smaller than my size will
they kind of fit I was using size 11
shoes I wear size 13 shoes so my toes
were really curled up inside it was a
really tight fit that wasn't comfortable
and then the waistband while they will
have different sizes the one here isn't
the right size for me so I couldn't wear
it so I was using shoes that weren't the
right size and I was not using the
waistband in a situation where I would
ideally be running so all that put aside
it was freaking amazing
um stepping into it I just stepped right
into the middle which made it so that it
didn't slip I don't know I'm not too
worried about that
there's also supports on the side so you
can hold some your weight up with it
taking your first few steps is kind of
surreal especially be especially because
that was the first time that I'd ever
worn oculus rift so walking around in it
is interesting when you can see
everything around you and you're like oh
this is kind of cool I'm
walking but not actually moving anywhere
that's interesting then you put the
oculus rift on and you're like holy crap
I'm walking and I'm not moving but I am
moving and I can look and shoot and do
all this kind of stuff all at the same
time so it definitely adds to the
experience which is awesome one thing I
did was I kind of was a little bit more
static because I had trouble turning
because I didn't have the angular weight
support of the belt to kind of keep me
where I was supposed to go turning was
difficult so whenever I saw enemies I'd
kind of just stand there and shoot which
is less fun than it could be but then
again you will have the belt that fits
your size so I wouldn't worry too much
about that the gun Linus brought up
something it would be nice if there was
a good reload function but then I know
on Kickstarter right now there's another
gun called I believe the Delta six sorry
if I'm wrong where you can actually just
take the magazine out put the magazine
back in and that acts as a reload
function so while the gun we were using
might not have been the exact perfect
gun for that situation that we were
using they are out there and you can use
any one you want so I wouldn't worry too
much about that I almost fell a few
times again I wasn't wearing the belt I
really don't think I would have fallen
if I wore the belt I don't think it
would have fallen anyways but I might
have possibly damaged some of the arms
sorry I'll be doing my second try but
like I said - was kind of running around
a lot more than I was if I saw enemies I
would set static and shoot them that was
crazy I I get nauseous sometimes when I
drive in cars so I was a little bit
worried about this I kind of kind of
threw it away when they brought it up
but I do actually get nauseous sometimes
in cars I get carsick so I was a little
bit worried like I just said but I
didn't I didn't get carsick at all
because and I think it helped that I had
the Omni because I was I did have the
feeling that I was moving myself so
while people have trouble with oculus
rift getting nauseous if you actually
feel like you're moving and you get the
visual responsive moving I don't
actually feel it that bad if I tilt my
head to the left
the screen tilts to the left if I walk
forward I walk forward so I don't know
at least for myself I
the Omni would help if you get nauseous
when using oculus rift and honestly I
think that's about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
