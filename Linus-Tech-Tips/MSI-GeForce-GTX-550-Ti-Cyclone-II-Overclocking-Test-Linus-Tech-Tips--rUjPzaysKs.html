into its overclock this is the cyclone 2
model I am NOT using the reference
cooler for my overclocking testing and I
am not quite able to break a 15,000
3dmark score in Vantage by like 63
points which is really a shame but there
you have it the final clocks that I
ended up with are 1.0 7 8 gigahertz
which if I could get it to focus you
would be able to see come on darken a
little bit or brighten a little bit
whatever okay now look at that and then
look at that quick can you see it
whatever okay and then on the memory I
was able to get around 2.2 gigahertz not
not to too much of an overclock on the
memory itself so thank you for checking
out this little overclocking adventure
on the gtx 550 ti don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from our
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos well I don't have a version of
After Burner yet that supports over
volting on the gtx 550 but two point one
point zero does support at least
changing the clock speeds so here's my
default clocks on the msi cyclone 2
version of the gtx 550 and you can see
here that i have already run my stock
clock benchmark so i was able to achieve
13 just over 13,000 3dmark scores in the
performance mode of 3dmark Vantage so
what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna tune this
card into whatever clock i can or
whatever clocks i can get out of it and
see what kind of a performance
improvement we can get by overclocking
this particular video card i'm not going
to be having a look at the reference
card but something to remember that the
reference card starts 50 megahertz lower
than this particular overclocked card so
it may have more overclocking Headroom
based on that it starts lower in terms
of sheer how many megahertz you can turn
it up
but it probably won't be able to get as
high with the cooler that's not as good
as well as with the absence of the
heatsink on the v RM</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
