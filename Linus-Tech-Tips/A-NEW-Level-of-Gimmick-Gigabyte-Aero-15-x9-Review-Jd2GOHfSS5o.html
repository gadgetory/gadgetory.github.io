arrow 15 we concluded that it was the
perfect thin gaming laptop because well
at the time it was pretty much the only
thin gaming laptop that didn't make a
bunch of other stupid compromises in the
name of just raw performance but since
then the field has opened up a fair bit
with Razer refreshing the blade alien
we're bringing out the m15 and a sous
continually refining their zephyrus
lineup
so then gigabytes response to all this
mounting pressure ai ai ai laptop what
even is AI laptop oh if we get to that
later yeah no okay
so then AI laptop can a feature that we
called the worst demo at CES 2019
possibly make the Aero 15 x9 stand out
from the crowd and failing that is the
overall design still solid at least with
glass where you can instantly see your
current and past network activity detect
malware and block badly behaving apps on
your PC or Android device use offer code
Linus and get 25% off glass wire at the
link below
looking at the arrow 15 the overall
design is reminiscent of the gaming
laptops of several years ago which I
guess makes sense since it hasn't gotten
a chassis update for about two years
with that said I can't really complain
about the ID from an objective
standpoint the screen bezels are super
narrow the chassis is nice and rigid and
the design is reasonably understated so
it won't give away how much raw gaming
performance is inside if you're worried
about that sort of thing in your board
meetings sticking with a more
traditional design also means more
traditional i/o quite literally more of
it along the sides we find loads of USB
Taipei's and HDMI port and even a full
sized SD card reader so you can go
dongle free if you want then they also
threw in Thunderbolt 3 if you're more of
a dongle embrace er so that's all pretty
normal so far but where the arrow 15 is
exceptional is under the hood ours comes
equipped with an Intel Core I 989 50 HK
yes that's the overclockable one and an
NVIDIA r-tx 2070 max-q meaning that it
packs considerably more punch than I
would expect and even in most cases
recommend in a chassis this slim like we
have seen much thicker laptops than this
fail to cool this CPU adequately and as
for how gigabyte fares
although the Aero does have a better
showing than the MacBook Pro it only
narrowly edges out the core i7s in its
competition in most tasks and
occasionally even gets straight-up
beaten all while hitting the thermal
limits of the chip so what this
basically means is you should buy the i7
model to get similar performance for
less monies it might not sound as sexy
and exciting but it will still be
incredibly competent at video editing
gaming and really whatever you want to
throw at it as for the RT X 2070 max Q
well since this is our first laptop with
one of these we can't say exactly how
it'll compare to other RT X 2070 max Q's
but what we can say is that it performs
pretty darn well
expect to be getting lots of frames in
your games with anything but the
heaviest triple-a titles with r-tx
enabled being capable of hitting the 144
Hertz refresh rate of the built-in
display many of them even on Ultra
settings perhaps more impressively is
the fact that our Aero 15 X 9 managed to
do this while maintaining a sort of high
but still very reasonable noise level
okay then what about the apparent star
of the show a I cannot make the core i9
cool through machine learning sorcery or
give our mirror artsy acts 20:7 t the
graphical performance of a Titan no
actually everything we've shown you guys
so far has been with AI enabled and
unfortunately contrary to the claims
that gigabyte was making back at CES it
does not give you any extra performance
but that doesn't mean that it's pure BS
either see the AI will optimize the
system based on what tasks you're
currently performing so if it sees that
you're playing a game it will optimize
for GPU performance and up the fans
during a render it will optimize for CPU
and then when you're just working on a
word document it will optimize for low
acoustics and so on and so forth now all
of these modes are available on
basically every gaming or a professional
laptop on the market but according to
gigabyte anyway 80% of users never
bother changing the modes which
basically means that having AI enabled
is not going to be giving you a hundred
and twenty percent performance it just
also means that you'll be getting your
100% ish performance at a lower power
level and/or noise envelope without ever
having to think about optimizing any
settings so then now that our
expectations have been adjusted those
really were some outlandish claims they
were making at the show it is much more
clear to me how this technology can
deliver a very real benefit to the
average user and the good news kind of
keeps rolling here gigabyte really hit
nail on the head with the display it's
144 Hertz refresh rate makes it
excellent for gaming and it's Pantone
color calibration makes it even suitable
for prosumer level photo or video work
the only other thing that I might want I
guess is G sync for the hardcore gamers
but for the eagle-eyed among you who are
bothered by the pedestrian 1080p
resolution you can simply go for the 4k
60 Hertz panel if you prefer it to comes
Pantone certified where gigabyte misses
the nail however and goes straight for
the thumb is the webcam thanks to its
spectacular placement below the screen
you're enjoying just a tremendous view
of my nose hairs and making matters
worse I lied
there's nothing spectacular about any of
it the image quality is unexceptional at
best and it doesn't support Windows
hello it's just not spectacular at all
and I know I'm harping on this a bit
here but holy crap stop doing this there
are plenty of other solutions the
trackpad is alright though it's
glass-topped
doesn't flex over much it's a decent
size and it uses the windows precision
drivers which checks all the boxes for
me putting it shockingly in like
second place for gaming laptop track
paestum that we've looked at recently
not not bad just don't screw it up and
it's all good
what isn't quite as good though is the
keyboard it's only fine the force
required to press the keys is a little
high
despite the switches having no real
tactile bump the key stabilization could
be better and the smaller right shift
key is a little bit awkward to hit
honestly though it was probably a -
material a couple years ago but nowadays
it's just a B+ since this is another
area where the competition has really
stepped up their game
another area the competition has caught
up is in the battery life Department
with alien wear and razor now boasting
large capacity batteries the 94 watt
hour unit in the Aero 15 x9 isn't quite
as impressive anymore
but given that 94 watt hours is
getting very close to the limit to what
you can carry on to a plane there really
wasn't a ton of room for upward mobility
for gigabyte here and be around six
hours that you get is still darn
impressive
honestly it only gets beaten by laptops
that have sacrificed performance making
this a very potent machine for people
that need both power and potency on the
go as for upgradability opening up the
Aero 15 we get easy access to both RAM
and storage along with that massive
battery which is pretty much all we can
really hope for in a laptop like this so
full marks there and all that means the
Aero 15 is sitting in pretty good shape
here standing up to basically every test
we could think to throw at it even if it
didn't blow me away at any point which
leads us perfectly into the conclusion
if money was no object honestly I would
take either the razor blade 15 or
alienware M 15 over this but
unfortunately for all of us money is a
thing and this is where the arrow 15 X 9
really flexes with our recommended
config coming in at a hundred and fifty
dollars less than the alien Ram 15 and
two hundred and fifty dollars less than
the razor blade with double the storage
to boot it's really hard not to get
behind the awesome versatility of this
unit from gigabyte so thanks to Joan for
sponsoring this video their meeting room
booking devices well make booking
meetings in your meeting rooms a lot
easier with a Joan device outside your
meeting room or conference room you can
schedule a meeting from anywhere and
then not have to worry about someone
nabbing the conference room right as you
need to go in for a call to conduct an
interview or to do a presentation it
easily syncs with all major calendars
it's completely wireless and the Joan
board gets up to a year of battery life
so check them all out over at get Joan
calm and use code Linus 8 to get 8
percent off show it to your colleagues
and/or your boss so thanks for watching
guys if this video sucked you know what
to do but if it was awesome get
