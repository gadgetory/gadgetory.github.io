z77 board this one took me a little bit
longer sorry about that but here we are
this is the Z 77 X UD 3h gigabytes whole
slogan for this is insist on ultra
durable so they mean a new version of
ultra durable ultra durable has been
through a number of revisions so it
started with the two x copper PCB which
is better for heat dissipation as well
as for performance and it's now up to
ultra durable 4 which includes high
temperature protection humidity
protection with their new glass fabric
PCB which apparently allows it to be
more resistant to humidity and moisture
next is their electrostatic protection
as well as power failure protection so
that is ultra durable according to
gigabyte and they want you to insist on
an ultra durable motherboard for your
new PC we also see a couple other focus
things here that is their patent-pending
3d power all digital engine so that
means all aspects of your CPU and memory
are being powered and digitally so that
is your onboard GPU your on core your
core your memory all of that good stuff
very cool as well as their 3d bios so
what they mean by 3d bios is cool UEFI
bios that is graphical interface bios
that has kind of a unique interface i
think they have you usually have a
picture of it yeah so there's a picture
of it here
so they show you like a picture of a
motherboard and you just click on the
SATA ports if you want to change
something about your boot order or
whatever and it's it's very graphical so
if you want to change something but your
CPU or memory you click on the CPU
socket it gives you all the relevant
options in one place so this is a LGA
1155 board with the z77 chipset which
means we've got support for all that
cool z77 stuff including PCI Express
gen3 as well as Intel's Intel's
onboard USB 3 ports so that is to the
front ports and two rear ports are going
to be powered by the Intel chipset we've
got virtue MVP which is an upgraded
version of lucid virtu which allows you
to use the onboard GPU that's built in
the cpu to do things like transcoding
video which is very very fast compared
to the traditional methods but still
take advantage of the dedicated graphics
card for 3d games crossfire and SLI are
both supported as well as the MCU
onboard connector but I'll show you more
about that in just a moment so all
digital power there you go CPU graphics
memory and vtt and what else we got load
line calibration okay most modern boards
that are somewhat decent per
overclocking do have load line
calibration this is a good one smart
response so gigabyte has a much easier
way than their competitors of setting up
smart response that's basically like two
clicks on a little application that you
download it's really really simple to
set up remember Smart Response allows
you to take up to a sixty gig SSD and
use it as a cache for your boot hard
drive or any other hard drive I guess
although I'm not convinced that it makes
much sense to use it on something that's
not a boot drive unless maybe you play
like mmo's or whatever your MMO
installed on a separate drive and then
that way Smart Response will make sure
that you've got all of the most relevant
things that you use most frequently
fashioned to the SSD so okay I guess I
could kind of see that most games don't
benefit much from an SSD in terms of on
loading times though so just something
to be aware of I would usually use my
response for the boot drive right
accessories for SATA cables two of them
are right angle two of them are not
right angle we've got a flexible black
sli bridge exactly the right kind we
have an IO shield a multilingual
installation guidebook in a user's
manual including a DVD with utilities
and drivers but you shouldn't use and
you should download the latest off the
gigabyte website here is the board
itself gigabyte does such a good job of
their board aesthetics these days we've
got just a nice slick of black white and
blue color scheme don't worry these are
stickers these are stickers this isn't a
sticker this is my one complaint
actually about the x79 board that I'm
using in my system right now it looks so
sleek except for BAM orange light red
button so what I'm probably gonna do on
on that board is just paint over it and
black nail polish or something like that
and it'll be all good so there's the LGA
1155 socket supporting second generation
and third generation Intel
or processors code-named Sandy Bridge or
Ivy Bridge as well as our power delivery
with kind of a neat looking little
heatsink II thing going on with depth
like an arrow going on in the middle and
wavy looking fan of things the the TDP
of the CPUs that go in here is 77 watts
for Ivy Bridge or 95 watts for Sandy
Bridge so we don't need a ton of power
delivery we've got an 8 pin power
connector anyway and it's in its ideal
location up at the top left of the board
speaking of ideal locations I'm
personally a big fan of having the power
button up here as opposed to down here
the onboard power button the reason for
that is that this is easier to reach
when you have a couple graphics cards
installed which sometimes I do we've
also got our CMOS switch button as well
as our reset switch arsenal's CMOS which
I think they made see most clear switch
least I hope that's what they mean
there's another clear CMOS down here you
know what give me a woman here guys I'm
gonna try and figure this out so this is
fairly straightforward that is the CMOS
clear switch this guy right here
switches you between the main BIOS on
the back up BIOS so that's more of like
a CMO or like a BIOS chip switch and
then this one these two jumpers right
here are a clear CMOS jumper as well so
you've got a multitude of different ways
to manage the BIOS or the UAF I should
probably stop calling in a BIOS it's not
really called that anymore of this
motherboard your 24 pin connectors and
it's ideal location along the right-hand
edge and you've got another auxilary
connector here so that's kind of
interesting
someone actually messaged me not that
long ago saying that their friend had
misunderstood when I was talking about
one of these connectors on the x58 OC
board from gigabyte and had thought that
he could plug his hard drive into it
that's not how it works
this is auxilary par for the motherboard
using a SATA power connector from your
power supply so it's if you have
multiple graphics cards installed just
for additional stability I can't imagine
you'd need it on this board but it's
there if you want it we've got to say
two three six gigabit per second ports
powered by the Intel chipset as well as
4 SATA 2 3 gigabit per second ports
please note SATA port 5 that is their
numbered 0 to 5 so the last one is going
to be disabled if you
something into the mSATA slot here so M
SATA is a standard that's used for SSDs
particularly useful if you want to run
Intel Smart Response technology without
actually plugging an SSD into a bay in
your case you can just clip it in right
there it's just running at SATA to three
gigabit per second mode we have a post
debug led which has all the codes
outlined in the manual we have our front
panel connectors for your power and your
reset and all that good stuff front
panel USB - I couldn't help noticing the
absence of one of their super charging
USB ports so that's that's kind of
interesting I guess that's a feature
this board doesn't have that the
higher-end board does have a very useful
one indeed
it does have on/off charge though it
means that you can't charge your devices
even though the system is powered off
we've also got a front panel audio
header in its ideal location at the
bottom left of the board and in terms of
PCI Express slot layout we have
something that actually looks pretty
good so if you have a low-end system
that is to say one graphics card your
PCI slot will be accessible which stands
to reason whereas if you do a high-end
configuration with dual PCIe graphics
cards it will cover that PCI slot so
they kind of aim it towards the higher
end the build you go for on this the
fewer legacy PCI slots will be available
which kind of makes sense so if you do
install dual graphics cards you're gonna
be left with one two PCIe 1x as well as
a PCIe 8 X a PCIe and our sorry ended
and a PCIe 4x so if you're running sli
or crossfire these two are gonna run an
8x8 X mode but remember that's PCIe gen3
with an Ivy Bridge CPU which means that
the bandwidth is equivalent to PCIe gen
- 16 X I forgot to mention earlier that
ddr3 dual channel is supported up to 4
dims and remember guys Ivy Bridge CPUs
will also unlock a plethora of hahaha I
think that's the first time I've used
that word on tech tips of new memory
speeds that were not available on Sandy
Bridge CPUs now the back of the board we
find a few interesting things so one of
them is a ps2 keyboard mouse combo port
still like to see those 1 2 3 4 5 6 USB
3.0 ports these two of them are running
off the Intel chipset and four of them
are not now I have a concern about the
fact that this board doesn't have any
USB 2 ports
because from time to time USB three
drivers are not going to be
automatically installed by your OS which
means that if you're operating all of
your peripheral is based on the back
panel ports and you haven't installed
the driver for those ports yet your
keyboard and mouse might not work so I
would definitely recommend if you have
one of these boards and you're having
trouble with it just use one of your
front headers plug into your front USB 2
in order to get up and running and then
install your drivers and then these
should all work just fine we've also got
VGA DVI HDMI and DisplayPort out options
remember with Ivy Bridge you can support
up to three displays out at a time even
on onboard graphics optical audio out
dual eSATA Gigabit Ethernet as well as
7.1 analog audio out round out the i/o
options on this board nice little
touches matte black PCB using proper
screws to attach all of the coolers on
this board in spite of the fact that it
is a UD three level board so this is not
a premium level board another nice touch
is the fact that they have included SLI
support even though this is a more value
segmented board as well as oh yeah
there's the front USB 3 which I don't
think I ever showed you so finally last
but not least we have one two three four
five wow that's actually not bad five
four pin pwm fan headers and don't
