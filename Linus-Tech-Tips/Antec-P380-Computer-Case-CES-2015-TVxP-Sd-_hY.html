brought to you by phantom glass visit
store antem dot glass for the best iron
screen protectors out there as well as
HyperX guys welcome back to the ant x
suite where we're checking out the p-38
e successor to the p 280 a pretty huge
deal case they took some user feedback
you guys have probably already seen this
from Computex footage from other sites
but they took some user feedback in
terms of costs thickness could the
options stuff like that so the first
thing you'll notice is that this lining
around the outside of the aluminum
paneling is quite a bit thinner they
reduced a lot of cost there and a lot of
weight who's a really heavy case as well
now if we jump on the inside you'll see
that the hard drive cages are now in
three separate sections so you can
actually remove them the top one is to
the bottom two are both three hard
drives individually you can remove them
you can add radiators or fans where they
once were or you can just move them
around the case to customize the layout
yourself however you actually want to go
about that they've also done a little
bit of cost savings inside the case so a
little bit of thick thinner metal inside
the case as well which will be passed
down to you so it should be a cheaper
lighter case in those aspects and also
the i/o that you can see here kind of at
the top just under that aluminum Ridge
can be swapped from one side to the
other side depending on say you put it
under your desk and you want that i/o to
be on a certain side either on the say
left side if it's on the right side of
your desk for easier plugins or if
you've moved over to the right side to
be able to kill manage those easier and
hide them the top is compatible with the
360 rad or various fan configurations
down from there and you're able to
access those through the removable
aluminum section at the top also you can
put another 360 rad or equivalent of
fans in the front of the case if you
remove or move around those hard drive
cages that we were just previously
talking about also a fairly standard
fare I don't think these things have
changed this is kind of a high-end and
tech product you have sound dampening
inside the panel you have nice rubber
grommets inside the rest of the case all
that kind of stuff that you guys
probably saw in the old Computex videos
from other people so I'm not going to
cover those too much thank you for
watching this content Thank You phantom
glass for sending us here this year in
protecting our phones we've got a really
cool video coming from them fairly soon
they get a HyperX as well check out
their YouTube channel they're really
close to a hundred thousand subscribers
and they released some pretty cool
gaming content
thank you guys for watching this video
again and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
