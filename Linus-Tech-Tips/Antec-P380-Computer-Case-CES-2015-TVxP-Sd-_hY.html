brought to you by phantom glass visit
store phantom glass for the best darn
screen protectors out there as well as
hyperx guys welcome back to the antec
suite where we're checking out the p380
successor to the p280 a pretty huge deal
case they took some user feedback you
guys have probably already seen this
from computex footage from other sites
but they took some user feedback in
terms of cost thickness two of the
options stuff like that so the first
thing you'll notice is that this lining
around the outside of the aluminum
paneling is quite a bit thinner they
reduced a lot of costs there and a lot
of weight to it's a really heavy case as
well now if we jump on the inside you'll
see that the hard drive cages are now in
three separate sections so you can
actually remove them the top one is to
the bottom two are both three hard
drives individually you can remove them
you can add radiators or fans where they
once were or you can just move them
around the case to customize the layout
yourself however you actually want to go
about that they've also done a little
bit of cost savings inside the case so a
little bit of thick thinner metal inside
the case as well which will be passed
down to use it should be a cheaper
lighter case in those aspects and also
the i/o that you can see here kind of at
the top just under that aluminum Ridge
can be swapped from one side to the
other side depending on say you put it
under your desk and you want that I oh
to be on a certain side either on the
left side if it's on the right side of
your desk for easier plugins or if
you've moved over to the right side to
be able to kill manage those easier and
hide them the top is compatible with the
360 rad or various fan configurations
down from there and you're able to
access those through the removable
aluminum section at the top also you can
put another 360 red or equivalent of
fans in the front of the case if you
remove or move around those hard drive
cages that we were just previously
talking about also fairly standard fare
I don't think these things have changed
this is kind of a high-end and tech
product you have sound dampening inside
the panel you have nice rubber grommets
inside the rest of the case all that
kind of stuff that you guys probably saw
in the old computex videos from other
people so I'm not going to cover those
too much thank you for watching this
content Thank You phantom glass for
sending us here this year in protecting
our phones we've got a really cool video
coming from them fairly soon they get a
hyper x as well check out their youtube
channel they're really close to
thousand subscribers and they released
some pretty cool gaming content thank
you guys for watching this video again
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
