Jersey which I've been informed as
pronounced Carney so I learned something
for a collab and studio tour with the
legendary mkbhd a collaboration that has
been in the works since 2013 but
honestly I've got to say we almost
didn't make a video I mean mark has
warned us on the way up that the place
is a little messy right now but nothing
could have prepared me for the pigsty
that we were heading into especially
compared to our studio which is
immaculate Brow's privately and securely
with tunnel they're the simple VPN app
try tunnel bear for free at the link in
the video description so this is it the
mkbhd studio every bit as stylish and
immaculate as it appears in the videos
at least on the surface but we went
through here with a fine-tooth comb and
found all kinds of problems I mean look
at this thing if you're gonna try and
convince me that you vacuum by having a
vacuum on display right when I come
through the door I mean at least have
vacuumed in the last 6 months before we
come in here do you have any idea how
much lint there is on this carpet holy
Sh fire hazard
see this screwdriver out of alignment
here it's not in all the way it's like
the guys never heard of a velcro wrap
Marquez you're gonna try and convince me
you need server rails the tripping
hazard here I mean if you're gonna go to
the effort to make your carpet oh my god
you're not just cheap you're lazy you
have the transition strip I just don't
have a saw oh my god I hope okay okay
empty box everything's okay we don't
need to call the bomb squad
nothing is empty yeah everyone all what
are you getting President Trump now you
got your you got your executive order
you got your speech you wrote but that's
not a bad idea I could use that as a
crowd these are okay you're working on a
video I can respect that
yeah I understand that okay yeah what
are you cooling with this you're cooling
your drawer oh I'm gonna be sick look at
that Apple TV okay dude how hard is that
huh
the RSS cushion and the SUBSCRIBE
cushion those are pretty cool are you
 me you're running a Quadro M
6000 to play what
not a whole lot I'll pay that do you
even know how much that graphics card
costs I'm gonna estimate 4000 okay
you're somewhere in the neighborhood oh
my god you don't even respect the
position you're in
look at this you got the 1 million
plaque sitting literally in a pile of
garbage this is the worst thing I've
seen yet
okay mkbhd fake videos look at this desk
computer computer computer one monitor
it's fake these are just props to him
they're just props to him look at this
these keyboards can't even bother to put
a velcro cable tight this is probably
the one that came with it I'm
unbelievable oh wow I suppose you're
gonna blame IKEA for this - this IKEA is
Fault oh my God look at the way the Sun
is drain the color out of this packaging
how old are these you better if used by
July 2013 oh my god everything I knew
about you is a lie
you don't even eat honey nut cheerios
not those there's just a prop to you now
we're getting into the place where you
obviously spend most of your time we've
got the little shrine to your ego here
subscriber counter along with ample
supply of moisturizer and tissues there
so this is mkbhd corner okay precip sand
looks at that and what else we got over
here
you know what I'm not even going to
spend too much time on your desk I think
the audience's covered this pretty well
outdated and overpriced computer and
misaligned wall panels
that's pretty much all there is to say
about it okay let's move on to the gear
closet you don't even have a liner in
your garbage can you have any idea how
disgusting that is oh maybe we got the
mother lode
we got a customized iPhone 6 or 6s looks
like a six was that that is a that is a
pretty cool cut like a metric ass Lotus
Nokia's got pretty much every phone oh
my god it's a bomb dude you can't keep
that stuff around I get out the note
seven that's one just one that's the
most dangerous thing in this entire
office what if I never it in you
know what's the second most dangerous
thing your allergy to cable ties you
know how expensive they are mr. red
cameras look at him he puts his red
cameras on display that he can't buy a
Velcro cable tie you've got fancy mkbhd
a oneplus cable here I get started right
away
okay thank you that's better now I hope
I hope that this inspection hasn't felt
like a criticism of you personally no
way I hope that you're taking it more as
like a constructive effort to help you
do better in the future
I should shop less at IKEA you should
shop less at IKEA yes and you know if
