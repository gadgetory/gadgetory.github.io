thermal solutions p HTC one 4 p e so
this supports Intel LGA 2011 AMD m3 +
and FM 1 + ah interesting
doesn't support LGA 1155 well we'll find
out when we open it up but let's have a
look at what they have to say for
themselves in terms of specs ok so it's
a heatsink and fan hot is compatible if
LGA 1155 given 30 666 and 755 cool ok
materials copper aluminium for the fins
from shield patented ok this duel fans
included dual 140 millimeter fans
included cool compatible with 140 s or
120 s is it updraft floating balanced
bearing for the fans neat Maelstrom
vortex booster design for the 9 blades
on the fan that's cool as well
heatsink dimensions you know what let's
just open it up because usually with
heat sinks the beastliness and all that
looks good the awesomeness of them is
pretty apparent once you get them opened
up and that looks that looks dead sexy
finish is perfect no blemishes
whatsoever got a nice brushed blue whoa
ok I'm sort of sold on this actually
alright let's get this opened up um I
don't know how the packaging works I
don't want to fingerprints on anything
ok yeah that'll do ok we'll get to this
more after whole big fatty pipes okay
normally I don't really care about air
cooling to be perfectly honest I'm more
of a water cooling guy but some air
coolers are worthy of being thought that
they're cool and this appears to be one
of them alright packaging is pretty
straightforward
contains all the stuff and the first
thing you're going to want to do is get
it out of the way so you can check out
this beastly
beastly air cooling heatsink so it's a
dual tower design which is similar to
other very high performance heat sinks
on the market such as the Cole gage Aero
thermal bright silver arrow nocked wa HD
14 comes with a wide variety of
different back plates and whatnot so you
got all your different positions for the
back plate there LGA 2011 compatibility
is achieved using these guys right here
so you won't even need the back plate on
that one because it has kind of a built
in one
there's your AV stuff and here's all
your accessories including fan clips for
up to looks like up to three fans as
well as the universal hold down that
you'll need for all of the different
mounting options some thermal compound
pH and BC thermal compound and will look
a splitter they include a splitter so
you can run two fans natively off of a
single header so you'll only be able to
monitor the RPM of one of them but it's
not a big deal oh four pin pwm to three
pin adapter just in case you need one
sleeved in white well heat shrink tin
right in white alright here we go
so they also included a third fan just
in case we did want to run it with three
fans so fans accessories include soft
rubber mounts as well as a molex to
three pin adapter white sleeved cable
love that white sleeves very nice
bracket oh cool they include one of
those brackets so you can mount it above
your graphics card that's neat little
extras like that really go a long way as
well as to noise reduction doodads
try the included fans are more of an OEM
affair not a big deal though
holy crap this thing is so cool-looking
do want okay what's up let's take a look
at the heatsink itself so you've got
your branded covers on the top those do
nothing for performance but they look
really neat they're a bit of a darker
blue than the aluminum fins themselves
you can see these are a bit of a lighter
blue these are a bit of a darker blue
but it's not that noticeable if you're
looking at it like kind of from an angle
like that or anything like that
these are anodized aluminum fins up here
these are copper heat pipes that are
nickel-plated and look how thick these
heat pipes are five heat pipes go
through the base and that's all there's
room for you've probably seen coolers
that have more heat pipes than that but
these are thick heat pipes these what
are these these must be eight millimeter
heat pipes at the very least let me see
if they have anything to say about that
yeah eight millimeter heat pipes and
actually give me a sec guys so there's a
few more things to cover one of them is
there are two things patented PA TS so
this is a physical antioxidant thermal
shield which apparently increases the
cooling performance and reliability
while deflecting other thermal radiation
from other heat sources so in in theory
anything hot that's nearby should be
less likely to radiate heat that warms
up these these aluminum heat sinks and
it should also improve the performance
of the aluminum heat sinks as well to
have this coating on them okay so
there's that there's also patented CPSC
which is cold plasma spray spraying
coating technology so that is the method
of using the heat pipes to the base that
they're using that apparently improves
the thermal conduction from the base to
the heat pipes which in turn will allow
the CPU to be cooled more effectively a
couple more things just fan mounting
options so what I would generally
recommend if you're using the two fans
that are included would be blowing
through the fans here you can see that
these are actually not you can see that
these fans are relatively low rpm fans
on this double check with respect for so
they're only at 1200 to 1300 rpm and
what that means is that in order to
achieve optimal cooling with them with
this particular heat sink
fantex has designed the fins to be
fairly widely spaced so yes more surface
area is in general better when it comes
to cooling applications however if you
don't want to use extremely high rpm
extremely high pressure fans then you
want to give some space as well in order
to make optimal use of the you know
space in between it so that the air can
actually like fit through there so this
is what it will look like when it's
installed basically like a beast hold on
let me let me get this a little bit
better position it'll work better if
you're using the actual like mounting
hardware for them obviously so this is
come on - you can do it so this is what
it will look like Lance installed and
then if you install the third one it'll
be like that much more again and it'll
be pretty big I mean to give you guys
some some idea of the scale of this
thing ouch here it is next to a thermal
right Silver Arrow which is sort of
pending a CPU upgrade that I'll just
move so that's how big it is thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at fantex Oh No hold on ah right
something else to mention it is
available in a variety of colors and
comes with a five-year warranty so
colors available are red orange blue
silver and black so thank you for
checking out my unboxing the first look
