blackberry I switched I'm slick and this
part 2 will be a continuation of last
time where it's just more of a general
use case of the phone I realized after
reading some basic tips on blackberry 10
that if you hold the camera button down
here for long enough it'll open the
camera app one thing that I noticed that
I thought should be implemented and
wasn't implemented is the notifications
along this left side which look very
similar to the camera button if you hold
them nothing happens and if you just
keep kind of doing it the blackberry
will eventually tell you to just swipe
up to unlock your phone it would be nice
if like the camera app if I held one of
my notifications it would open the app
that corresponds with that notification
this is something I didn't notice right
away but for a different reason this is
not my sim in this phone this phone is
given to us by Bell so it's a different
phone number and everything sells
avoiding calling people and texting
because I didn't have contacts in my
phone or so I thought when I liked gmail
with my phone at grabbed all my contacts
with gmail almost without me noticing
which was great I'm not saying anything
bad about that and perfectly listed all
of them had all their information like
it was great I guess that's more on
gmail side but it's still great on
blackberry so since then I've used the
phones calling a texting features much
more and there's nothing really to note
this is more on bail side instead of
blackberry I haven't had any service
issues anywhere that I've been and
everything else has been fine as a
general observation about the blackberry
experience now this is not the heavy use
experience that will be next episode and
the next and the episode after that I
find out I spend less time on my phone
but not because I don't necessarily
enjoy the phone it's more because I come
on my phone I go to hub I check
everything I need to and then I just
feel like I'm done on Android I would
find that as I'm going through apps and
going individually to each app that I
want to see and going through all my
information checking everything I would
spend more time on this I get everything
I need to and I get out so I guess it
kind of depends on what you want do you
want to spend that much time when you
own some people do I'm not actually sure
at this point I like the experience of
my android phone where I can jump on and
each individual app is there at all I
can stuff which you can also do on
blackberry but the awesomeness of the
hub is that everything that you need to
know every direct notification that you
have is always there so you can just
quickly go through all the important
things and I just be done with your
phone which is also kind of relaxing i
use the music player but and it was fine
nothing really interesting to note but
one thing that i did notice is that the
phone has i believe at 16 16 different
volume levels so as you're going through
the volume rocker there's 16 stops which
is kind of Awesome actually my s3 has
seven I believe yeah my s3 has seven so
you wouldn't think that's that big of a
deal but for fine precision if you want
to be very quiet but it's maybe a quiet
video so you need some things to be
audible or if you want to just be super
loud but not quite as loud it's actually
kind of nice to have that many stops in
the volume knob we talked about this
last I'm a little bit but one thing that
I really don't like personally about the
blackberry experience so far is the
rotate it goes really slow as you can
probably see there I got comments saying
that that might be by design but if it
is by design it's not a design that i
personally like some people might like
it I don't you have to wait a while I
like snappier auto rotates also it works
well in some apps it doesn't work that
great in other apps and in your recently
used apps section it will save if it was
rotated or not so it just becomes a
hassle in my opinion so I usually just
go into the drop down in the top and put
rotation lock on so that it won't rotate
but then if i restart the phone in any
way it resets that setting so i'll reset
the phone or it'll die and i'll charge a
backup or something turn it back on and
then turn my phone and it will rotate
and it's just really annoying one thing
i don't like is when using stuff like
the hub if you send an email or
something it always attaches a this was
sent from i think is this was sent from
my blackberry 10 smartphone a lot of
different things have done this in the
past but i really don't like it i go
through and manually delete every single
time
so I guess it's not that big of a deal
but I I really don't like that so bbm is
cool being able to see if your messages
are read are cool everything that comes
with bbm is cool but the fact that I
only know two people that have
blackberries makes it not very cool
because there's not very many people
that I can actually do it with but that
being said I think a day or two ago
blackberry announced that they're going
to be releasing BBM apps for Android and
iOS so that might make buck blackberry
messenger cool again I don't know I just
don't have that use case yet hopefully
it gets released soon they said sometime
this summer so far now keep in mind this
is being said from a very basic use
point the next two videos will be more
events i'm going to sideload android
apps i'm going to do a whole bunch of
other stuff i currently would not really
recommend this phone to someone now
again this is i have not used android
side-loaded apps i'm completely ignoring
that whole part of blackberry just the
stock use case i would not necessarily
recommend this to someone who enjoys
spending a crazy amount of time on their
phone not that it's bad for that but i
feel like the best use case for this
phone is someone who wants to be able to
jump on their phone and instantly check
all their notifications and then be done
because it excels so much at that i
would recommend it to people that have
that use case scenario that are very
busy people that are into business I
need to be able to check things really
quickly and then get back to a meeting
or whatever they're doing that's awesome
but the comfy fluffy experience that is
Android and iOS or not I always so much
because I don't know iOS but at least
Android it's not the same the browser
seems all fine and good I haven't done
absolutely speed test bench marks on it
or anything but it seems not to slow but
also not exactly that fast although I do
like how it manages tab so in the bottom
left-hand corner there's a little button
that says exactly how many tabs you have
open pop that over it comes over from
the left and then you can cook one big
thing with tabs that I like is being
able to quickly close them so if you pop
it over from here you can just press the
little X and quickly close your tabs so
far I really like the typing experience
on blackberry the autocorrect of swiping
up from a letter to go with the next
word that corresponds with that letter
is nice once you get used to
it at the beginning it's kind of weird
because you have to go slow so that you
can kind of get used to when it's going
to pop up but then when you get used to
how it acts it can be quite quick
especially if you're typing with one
finger personally have very large thumbs
so I cover up a lot of the keyboard
while I'm typing so if I'm typing with
two fingers I can't really see the word
that's going to pop up above the letter
so sometimes it doesn't work that great
but if I'm typing with one finger it's
awesome makes me go way faster Waverly
faster sometimes one big complaint
though is if I want to type a word that
it doesn't like say awesomesauce but
with no space if I want that to actually
go through so I don't want a space in
between the words awesome and sauce I
have to swipe up from the space bar
because the space bar is going to
automatically try and correct simple
mistakes like no space between awesome
and sauce so if i press spacebar it goes
awesome space sauce if I swipe up it
goes awesome sauce one word but swiping
up from the space bar with a very large
thumb will very often close my texting
app because of how blackberry acts
swiping up from the bottom closes your
app now it's not supposed to because in
theory you're just swiping up from the
space bar but my thumb is huge I don't
like I've large hands so often no matter
how hard I try I'm swiping the whole app
away so sometimes even if i'm typing
with my thumbs i have to reconfigure how
I'm holding the phone and swipe up from
the space bar using my pointer finger so
I can actually do it accurately this
might not be a problem for everyone but
it's really annoying for me one thing
with blackberry that caught me off guard
was the story maker app it's the only
time that I felt blackberry actually
stepped outside of their element the
whole time you're using the phone it
feels very professional very clean cut
and then you step into the story maker
app and you just pick a whole bunch of
random photos pick a song and it makes
us a fairly nicely animated slideshow
with for you with fairly
professional-looking intro note rose
then I got to thinking and realize that
it's very professional-looking it's not
super flashy it's fairly
professional-looking so my theory behind
this is that you're running late for a
meeting and you need a slideshow so you
can just make a little slideshow on
so that basically concludes the ending
of my standard use case scenario for
this phone next week I will be doing a
lot of side loading android apps and
very recently as some of you have told
me and I found out myself skype actually
finally released their official release
of their skype app it's no longer in
beta so I'll be trying that as well
comment below on anything you would like
me to do for next blackberry i switched
