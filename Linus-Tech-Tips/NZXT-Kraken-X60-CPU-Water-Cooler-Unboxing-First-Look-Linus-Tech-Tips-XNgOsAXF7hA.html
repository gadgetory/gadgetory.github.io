now we've already looked at the Kraken
x40 this is the kraken x 60 from NZXT
this is an all-in-one liquid cooler that
uses dual 140 that's one four zero
millimeter fans in order to achieve
massive surface area now I've said this
time and time again people always ask me
- you know which one's gonna perform
better this water cooler or some other
water cooler this air cooler you know
what guys it's really simple with
cooling it always comes down pretty much
to surface area that's that's all it is
cooling is not sort of it's it's
Newtonian physics it's not complicated
stuff the more surface area you have the
more heat you're going to be able to
dissipate and the more quickly you're
going to be able to do it and you can
see that NZXT has unabashedly compared
their kraken x 60 to a standard 240
millimeter liquid cooler so that would
be a duo 120 saying it has 36% more
surface area now not only that but
that's also going to give you more than
36 percent more usable surface area
because remember both that 120 ml
version and the 140 ml version lose the
same amount of area in dead space under
the fan hubs for example or in any cut
any other kind of of wasted space so
you're getting that that with that
scalability comes even more usable area
now the drawback being that most 140
millimeter fans are not actually very
well optimized for static pressure now
we do have fans that are the exception
to this rule such as the Noctua a series
ones that we're going to be using to
test the crack in X 40 or rather X 60
but it's something to be aware of in
general so here let's cover whatever
else ends yes yes to say for themselves
really quickly here so high performance
pump and copper block with interactive
digital fan control so it does come with
a software element that allows you to
sort of take advantage of that large
tower support with extended 16 inch
tubing ah yes so case support is going
to be a bit of a challenge here because
there's only so much you can do to to
optimize for compatibility with various
cases
when you have to 140 millimeter fans
that have to be out of particular
spacing and are going to need a
particular amount of room between
themselves and any other components in
order to be compatible so you can see
NZXT includes a couple of their black
and white fans I don't know that this is
a you know particularly high-pressure
design here's the Kraken controller
version 1.1 software you can download
the latest off the NZXT website but you
can like I said replace them with nock
to us and then you'll know for sure that
you have a pressure optimized design
mounting hardware there is very much
included indeed so we have everything
you'll need for Intel and AMD for the
last few generations of sockets
everything from 775 1155 1156 1366 2011
a.m. 2 a.m. to + am3+ a.m. 4 + I don't
know FM 2 plus everything that you could
pretty much want you've also got
instruction guide that pretty much tells
you what to do if you go on NZXT site
they're actually maintaining sort of a
wiki style article where you can find
out what cases are compatible so there
aren't many right now but we're planning
to jam this thing into a vengeance c70
with a little bit of modification so
that should be that should be a bit of a
treat there you guys now opening up the
Kraken itself you can see that it is
significantly larger than the types of
radiators we've seen before in fact let
me grab one so that I can do a direct
comparison here and I found one so
holding it up next to sort of my old
beat up you know this is actually the
first water cooling radiator I ever
bought this is a GT stealth 240 so
holding it up against that it's all fine
and good to show you guys this in terms
of graphics but when you actually hold
them up next to each other you can see
that the sheer scale of the dual 140
millimeter radiator dwarfs the scale of
a dual 120 millimeter Raider not rady
radiator
not only in terms of length but also in
terms of width and just sort of in every
possible dimension now the one area
where the Kraken x60 is not sort of
bigger than normal
is in terms of the thickness so this is
a normal slim radiator which means it's
going to be competitive with something
like in each 100 I surface area for
surface area kind of pound-for-pound it
is not a thicker style radiator like
we've seen with things like the H 80 now
another thing to note here is when we
get really close and have a look at it I
want you guys to check out the fin
density this isn't a hyper dense sort of
radiator but it's also not very loose
I'd say it's more like a medium thin
density that means that while it is
again always important on a radiator to
have a high pressure optimized fan it's
not going to be the end of the world if
you don't have the highest pressure fan
in the world on this particular rad
there we go giving you guys a good look
at that can kind of see through it on
the other side you can't see it have to
hold the angle just right okay let's see
if we've missed anything that NZXT has
to say for themselves on the box before
we move ahead I will be testing this on
our new liquid cooling and just general
cooling in general sort of test platform
large tower support yeah because that's
the only thing it supports with 16
inches of tubing SATA power connector
freeze the insulation completely sealed
system backed by two year warranty and
all that is pretty much stuff that we've
covered before they also have a little
graph on here that shows you how they
figure the performance stacks up against
it's 120 millimeter competitors so we
will definitely be having a closer look
at this on our own test bench because as
interesting as it is for the
manufacturers to say this is how our
product compares against the other
things you know they're all using
different fans they're all using
different test platforms they're all
potentially using different CPUs so it's
hard to get the numbers validated so
we're gonna check with our 3930k
overclocked with nock to a fans in a/c
70 and we're probably gonna have to
drill some holes in the case to get this
to fit which is sort of you guys better
get used to that idea because dual 140
millimeter red plus 140 millimeter fans
a lot of stuff so the actual CPU block
itself has swivel fittings on it which
I'm really glad has become a bit of a
standard thing and what's great about
that is just the fact that it makes
installation easier so no matter what
angle your CPU cooler is installed that
you're going to be able to rotate
fittings to get to where you need to go
it's got pre-applied thermal compound
this is a high quality thermal compound
that ASA Tech uses that's right ASA Tec
if you guys have seen this ring
retention design before or you think
you've seen it before then you'll know
why and it's because it's used by by ASA
tech so the original LCL see has come a
long way in a lot of different ways
these swivel fittings are new from the
original design these LED lit logos on
the top are new from the original design
the retention mechanism is way better
than it used to be so guys instead of
like kind of fussing around with it and
trying to hold it in place you just put
this on then you actually put this clip
into place and it holds it actually held
on actually I'm not sure if it works
with the AMD one but at any rate it
works with the Intel one for sure so
here we go so you put this piece on
there we go yeah we put that there and
this guy goes here or something like
that you know what I'm pair figure out
how this works cuz I did it before now
I'm confused I'll be back on top how the
hell does this work I used to know
pathetic no I think I was doing it right
yeah those go in there and then this
piece like clips in or something yeah
see it's right okay there we go
and we're back yes I had it right before
that is exactly how it works so the
bottom piece clips into place which
holds that top retention bracket into
place so that you no longer have to
fight with it while you're holding on a
back plate and while you're trying to
screw something into it so it's a lot
easier to use them before also the
tubing being used here is extremely
flexible so the original designs had
like kind of a plastic tubing that
actually couldn't bend like this and
wasn't as easy to work with it put a lot
more strain on the components but this
is nice and softened and pliable last
but not least the connectors that come
off of it are now plentiful so you can
see there's a USB connector and it is
extremely beautifully sleeved so I don't
know how well you guys are going to be
able to see this in the camera here
probably really well since we're using
our awesome baller camera set up but
that is actually what allows it to
interface with the USB port on your
computer which is what allows you to use
the software control next we've got the
power input or rather one of the power
inputs so that's for the pump itself
then we've got a SATA power connector
which acts as an auxiliary power
connector and that right there is
connected to four fan headers so those
are four four pin fan headers that you
can use to plug up to four fans in
push-pull into the pump itself so that
allows you to monitor and control those
fans the same way that you normally
would except that they're all in like if
they were plugged into your motherboard
header except they're all controlled
through the software and they're all
plugged in through the Kraken x60 itself
so I think that pretty much wraps this

subscribed so that you see the
performance testing and don't forget to
well subscribe to it see this is my
standard outro so now that I already
told you to subscribe I've totally
ruined it but don't forget to subscribe
