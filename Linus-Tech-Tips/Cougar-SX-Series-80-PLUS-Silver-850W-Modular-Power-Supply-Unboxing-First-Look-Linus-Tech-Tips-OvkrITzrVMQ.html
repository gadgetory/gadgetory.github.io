power supply and if you want to find out
more about this brand cougar you can go
to cougar - WorldCom now I recommend you
type that directly into your browser bar
and do not type it into Google
okay that is cougar WorldCom this power
supply is a mvgame ready it is crossfire
certified as well as sli certified it is
an 80 plus silver power supply and does
feature a modular interface I mean one
of the things I thought was really
exceptional about this product is
actually none of that because there's a
million-in-one power supplies on the
market but I really like the aesthetic
of it there aren't too many guys out
there that are really shaking up the
look of power supplies
so go ahead and get the camera on like
more of a top-down angle so that we can
know oh this is a nice package it's
actually so up here we find ok so this
is just to make sure that the top of the
box is like a black color so it looks
kind of nice when you open it I guess
potentially they could put something in
there if they wanted to in the future so
here we are we have this
compartmentalized little packaging
system here so we're gonna go ahead and
try to disassemble unbox if you will
ok there are some more modular cables
and there and here is the power supply
itself put that back together alright
here is a little presumably a QuickStart
guide introduction warning and safety
notes protect the PSU against moisture
some obvious stuff like that how to
install it
warranty is five years and cougar is
actually you can see the manufacturer
contact right here is Compu case so
compy case has been around a long time
they've been making case and power
supplies for a very long time so it's
not like cougar is a new company even
though it has a new brand alright and
we've got some basic specs here for the
whole series of SX so their entire SX
series is a B+ silver although they do
have other series of power supplies as
well including the GX which is 80 plus
gold as well as
it's shoot maybe CX but yeah like I said
you can check out more information on
Cougar world so here's a little cougar
cable tie that holds together the power
supply connectors that are hardwired
that's actually pretty nice like they've
got a few pretty nice touches here I
think this is pretty unique what they've
done with this leaving so you can see
they're using a reasonably good quality
sleeving which you don't see enough
these days you can't actually see very
easily the color of the cables
underneath it you can see it if you look
for it but like I said it's hiding the
cables somewhat whereas a lot of
sleeving seem to be like stretched like
I can't even really demonstrate it with
this one but it feels like it's
stretched too thin and you can see all
of the individual wires under it so
here's the 24 pin connector you can see
it is a 20 plus 4 it's quite long so
even if you have a bottom bottom mounted
power supply you'll be able to reach up
to the top let's have a look at the rest
of the hard wired connectors because
this can sometimes make or break a
modular power supply in my opinion so
let me see ok so we've got 2 PCIe 6 plus
2 pin so those pretty much essential for
an 850 watt power supply I'm going to go
ahead and assume you're running
something that requires a couple PCIe
connectors and then you have this is
probably too many cables to have
hardwired for this but we have an 8 pin
a 4 + 4 pin and then we have an
additional 4 pin 4 CPU so this gives you
every possible combination that you
could need for up at the top left of
your motherboard many motherboards today
actually do require more than one eight
pin connector for example the Big Bang X
power from MSI requires two eight pin
connectors although there are also
motherboards that require an eight pin
and a 4 pin mostly on the server side so
you'll be able to power whatever it is
you need to regardless of all of that
let's have a look at what else we have
for included modular cables as well as
oku we have more of these more of these
compare cable ties so these are just
little developers I really like these
actually you can see the whole front of
thee of the cable tie is made of the the
hard side of the velcro the prickly side
and then the entire back of it is made
of the soft side so it's all teeth at
the front and then it's all
any kind of perfec who's gonna eat I
like them except that a couple times now
but I think you get the point
all right let's see what you bought for
modular connectors so back here we've
got oh this is nice
so this is a multi rail power supply
actually we should talk a little bit
more about that and talk about the the
rail layout so this is a four rail power
supply and you can see that the labels
are all clearly the labels the rails are
all clearly labeled so 12 volt one is
powering the peripherals 12 volt three
is powering as well as 12 volt four is
powering the PCIe as well as the extra
eight pins plus for a second
12 volt four and three are powering the
PCI Express connectors so let's have a
look at the modular cables that are
included finally and we've got a couple
red ones so you can see these red ones
are both six plus two PCIe so that means
by default this power supply can power
up to to high-end GPUs which 850-watt
should be more than adequate for it and
then we've got some more peripheral
connectors so well this is kind of an
interesting way we've got a single
modular cable that has three SATA and
two molex and we have another modular
cable that is three molex so that is for
purely molex drives peripherals then we
have another one that is three SATA and
one wall X and then finally we have one
that is four SATA okay so that gives you
a point the combination that you can
plug in and really that's what modular
power supplies are all about flexibility
so let's talk more about the unit itself
you can see here on the bottom it used
as a pretty special fan so this is a
hydrodynamic bearing 140 millimeter fan
and it uses a very different layout to
the blades I'm not sure how well you can
see that but cougar claims that with
this blade design you're able to get
more silent performance and a longer
lifespan with the blade design as well
as the bearing design that goes into
this fan so that's pretty cool you can
see it's got silver accents here to go
with its 80-plus silver rating as well
as a very very cool finish to the paint
like this is uh this is a very very neat
finish you can see that it kind of
sparkles and shines but it is a purely
black paint and all of that texture is
actually right in the surface of the
paint so here we've got the Cougar logo
which is again silver because this is an
80 plus silver power supply and then we
have a bit of an orange accent so that
really matches the cables that come out
of it which are black white and orange
okay here we have oh yeah this is the
information I was looking for so out of
the 12-volt rails we can pull a maximum
of 828 watts
12 volt rail 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 are capable of 22
22 24 and 24 amps respectively that is
maximum per rail so that means you can't
actually pull 22 plus 22 is 44 68 you
can't actually pull like a hundred amps
out of this thing but it means that the
over current protection which this unit
does feature is not going to be
triggered until you reach those numbers
now let's just see if there's anything
else we wanted to talk about oh right
yeah because it's able to pull so much
from the 12 volt rail or not because but
what allows it to pull so much from the
12 volt rail is the DC to DC technology
so that keeps the voltage regulation
good and it also means that very little
of the internals of this power supply
are actually dedicated to providing 3.3
volt and 5 volt power so what that means
is you can pull a lot other 12 volt rail
it's just a better design these days
actually Plus that for a second so there
are a couple more points to make due to
the design of the power supply it does
feature very low ripple it also has all
Japanese solid capacitors and it's rated
at it's rated power for up to 50 degrees
Celsius so unlike many power supplies on
the market that are rated for an
unrealistic 30 degrees or even lower
than that this one is actually rated to
deliver its power when it's under a
loaded scenario so thank you for
checking out this unboxing I don't think
we talked about the back where we find a
power switch as well as a power plug and
more of an orange finish to the unit
yeah I mean really I wanted to talk
mostly about the aesthetic in this thing
because it's so cool thanks for checking
out the unboxing don't forget
scribe to my detectives last thing
included that I did forget to mention
during the unboxing of this product is
that it does include a very very thick
gauge power connector so you can see
this is quality right there they are not
expecting this to melt or otherwise
deform as this thing what is this here I
can actually tell you yeah this is a 14
14 gauge wire very beefy okay that was
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
