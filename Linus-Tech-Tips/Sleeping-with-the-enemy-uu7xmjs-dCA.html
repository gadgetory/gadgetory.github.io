you guys today
number one April 14th I am going to be
here at the new memory Express location
at 1900 West Broadway in Vancouver for
Meetup I'm going to be giving away swag
I'm gonna be giving away tech advice if
you're into that sort of thing and just
generally hanging out number two right
there's a new memory Express here at
1900 West Broadway they're a relatively
new face in BC but they've actually been
in business in Canada for over 20 years
with stores in Calgary Edmonton and
Winnipeg let's go have a look inside
it's actually kind of bizarre for me
walking into this place because back
when I was a product manager they were
one of my key rivals in fact I remember
one boxing day staying very very late
into the office waiting around for them
to post a new deal dropping our price by
$2 only to have them five minutes later
drop theirs by another $2 and going back
and forth and back and forth I mean now
they've got their uber price beat policy
which takes any authorized Canadian
price online or in-store and beats it by
10% so that takes some of the fun out of
it but I guess it's good for customers
right now this is one of their smaller
stores they've actually got a gigantic
one in Richmond BC but they've still
managed to pack a pretty impressive
amount of computers technology and
system components so let's have a look
at what they got closest to the entrance
they've got the key essentials Ethernet
cables and RGB fans sorry before anyone
gets triggered over here we've got
gaming chairs power supplies coolers and
then tons of peripherals so gaming
peripherals brands like Razer and
Corsair and then less gaming peripherals
so this is mostly dominated by Logitech
and Microsoft
we've got your phones tablets small
compact laptop side I think it must be
some kind of a law that you're not
allowed to open a computer store unless
you have like adorable kittens on mouth
pad somewhere anyway got your cleaning
supplies got your external drives
external drive enclosures if you prefer
to provide your own Drive got your
gaming laptop so everything from sort of
compact mid tier performance stuff all
the way up to like gtx 1070 based
devices you've got gaming PC's from
vendors like a sous lenovo and msi and
then on the other side you've got gaming
monitors from LG BenQ msi also a sous
and so what you can do is you can have
the gaming experience of the PC on the
gaming monitor and kind of demo both of
them on
Island this is a weird one they have
gift cards in here for everything from
stuff that makes a ton of sense like
memory Express League of Legends team
Xbox google play to things that make
absolutely no sense like Burger King
usually my significant other can tell
when I forgot and I just grabbed
something from the computer store but
this way nobody ever has to know tons of
gaming headsets right on the other side
of the gaming mice and then this is
monitored Emelyn where you can watch
someone who's got way cooler arm tattoos
than I will ever have build a computer
also they've got some other demos that
they run on here throughout the day
networking land has everything from
simple USB to Ethernet adapters to those
like massive routers that look like
Scary upside down Krabs attack and never
one to abide by these sorts of
restrictions from your mortals criminal
scum I'm gonna bring you guys around to
the back as well so this is where you'll
find memory cards more external drives
this is where actually the bulk of the
external drive stock is and then the
good stuff and then even more important
than that motherboards they've got all
the major brands so you got your
gigabyte you got your msi you got your
mercy soos they've got their whole lone
section here and this is cool if you buy
CPU RAM and motherboard they will
actually for free mount the CPU and the
RAM check and make sure everything's
working and even install the latest bios
so that you don't have to deal with the
hassle pretty cool moving over here
we've got the even more exciting stuff
we've got graphics cards what five 60s
five 70s five 80s GT x 1050 t is 10 60s
10 70s 1070 TI's 10 80s 1080p is it do
you guys have look at them all look at
all of these things do you guys have any
idea how much these things are worth you
got them just sitting here like any
random jackass could just you know can't
come out of here and like come around
back this is where you'll find anything
that's being held for a customer or
anything that doesn't look as sexy on
the Shelf so you've got all kinds of
SSDs two-and-a-half-inch nvme WD Samsung
Kingston you pretty much name it Ram is
also back here all the major brands so
you got your Kingston you got your
g.skill you got your Corsair
desktop laptop pretty much all back here
they've also got hard drives back here
lots of different selection there and
even more graphics cards look at this
that's where the shortage is coming from
memory Xpress was hoarding them all for
their grand opening over on this side
we've got all the kind of less sexy
looking stuff so you got your battery
backups that you know still have
packaging like it's straight out of the
90s although they are important you got
your backpacks you got your you know
bathrooms a small office this is printer
corner full of printer toner that kind
of thing they've got some monitor
overflow they've got some cases they've
got Wow look at this spindles of DVDs
people still buy those closing out the
tour customer service land is a big part
of the customer for life philosophy so
they do 15 day returns and exchanges
with no restocking fee on approved items
with all the original packaging and
accessories and then around this corner
they've got their on-site technicians
who handle RMA's system build system
repairs and they even do IT business
solutions so come check it out it's
gonna be on April 14th they're actually
open already in there's free parking in
the back the Vancouverites be like what
free parking wow that's the most
exciting thing about it there's actually
