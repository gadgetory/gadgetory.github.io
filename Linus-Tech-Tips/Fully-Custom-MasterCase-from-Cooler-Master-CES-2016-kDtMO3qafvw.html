powered by Squarespace remember guys
head over to Squarespace comm and build
your beautiful website today so we're
here in the cooler master suite where
they've got a couple things on display
number one is a 130 dollar air cooler
less the justification for that I'm glad
you asked because there are a couple of
things that they're pretty proud of here
number one is the performance obviously
they're saying that it's competitive
with even pretty good all in one liquid
coolers which actually makes a ton of
sense to me since it wouldn't be the
only high-end air cooler that is
competitive with high-end a i/os what's
also interesting about it is they've
actually redesigned the bottom plate to
instead of just have a vapor chamber
with some heat pipes kind of duct tape
to it now it's actually got four heat
pipes directly integrated into the vapor
chamber something that they're calling a
3d vapor chamber now there's more though
and it's that maker word that cooler
master has been on a boat and on a boat
over the last I don't know I guess ever
since they launched the master case and
that is the modularity of the design so
in addition to coming with two of their
pressure optimized fans you've got
swappable shroud so you can be like oh
it comes with 140s I actually want to
use 120s I want a little bit more
clearance for RAM or motherboard
components or whatever else it's also
got a swappable top plate so you can
dramatically change the look of the
heatsink if you're into that sort of
thing but lioness will they support it
with accessories and if you'd asked me
this back when they launched the
mastercase 5 originally I'd have said I
don't know I mean we've had a lot of
case makers promised us accessories and
upgrades and it's never really happened
but it looks like they're actually
serious about this I mean look at all
this stuff behind me for the mast the
original master case 5 and mastercase
pro 5 as well as the new master case
maker 5 that they're launching here at
the show so they've got the original
normal and windowed side panels but boom
now we've got a noise dampening side
panel and my personal favorite a
tempered glass side panel with a lock on
the top I am really liking that one
there's also a new top panel cover so
instead of being stuck with just mesh
now they've got one that gives you the
choice between
mesh and just a straight cover with a
magnetic look look at that clipping
mechanism this right here is the front
panel from the new master case maker
five and this one has this cool little
sort of magnetic system where you can
pop off that front flat panel you can
slide okay I want more airflow but none
of this is actually what I just said was
happening which was accessories for
those original cases here is where
you've got my attention they are
actually designing things to mount to
that kind of like that rail clip-on
system thing that they got over on the
right-hand side of the motherboard trade
so this guy right here is an airflow
duct that allows you to control the
length of the duct so depending on the
positioning of your PCI Express power
cot ports or whatever else the case may
be as well as the position within the
case so whether you're trying to aim at
one top card two cards that are kind of
spread out in SLI or even at the CPU
itself if you have no need for optical
drives this will take care of you and
this one right here I've actually been a
victim of the video card saying myself
and while most of the solutions that
I've ever seen to address this have been
extraordinarily clergy this simple wire
with a couple of little you know single
thumb screw
you know feet here actually looks
surprisingly good when installed in a
case that's you know done up and cable
managed as opposed to some of the stuff
I've seen before that's just like yeah
here's like basically like a tripod leg
that you can kind of put on the bottom
of your case and kind of hope that it
stays in place but I still wouldn't
blame you for not being that impressed
at this point I mean what is this a
couple of accessories for a case that's
been available for how long - no this is
where they are starting to get my
attention and where that whole Maker
spirit thing starts to really actually
make some sense
coolermaster is working on developing a
market place where they can enable
modders to create their own accessories
and sell them through cooler masters
ecosystem to allow people who own these
cases to continue to get a lot of
mileage out of them moving into the
future so this guy right here is got a
custom top panel a custom power supply
cover a custom front panel they're also
showing off some custom cables
this is from primo chill this one right
here all man bill Owen does such mmm PC
tech for those of you who aren't
familiar with his name does such amazing
like aluminum fan grill so we've got
this right here we've got look at this
custom power supply cover so it's got a
four pin molex connector in the back
furless like sick lighting effect and
there's all kinds of amazing stuff that
I would expect to be available through
this store that would allow you to
really get more out of this case if they
can pull it off then you would be able
to if there wasn't a manufacturer
enabling this kind of a market if you
just have to go through the forums and
kind of hope for the best
you'll have to find ways to manage the
quality and the accountability of the
whole process but if they can then they
might have actually finally found the
thing that makes the master case more
than just another case so don't miss any
