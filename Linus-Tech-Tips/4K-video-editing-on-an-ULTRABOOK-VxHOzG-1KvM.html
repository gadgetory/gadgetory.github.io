demo that I saw at the Intel booth at
PAX they were editing 4k video footage
from a Panasonic gh4 camera with truly
astonishing performance on an eight-core
extreme edition processor with quad
channel ddr4 memory etc so setup that's
not attainable to those people and the
demo would have been really impressive
to me not good well the power of the
eight core
if I hadn't recently with a lot of help
from Ed's all who also did the science
behind this video discovered that by
transcoding 4k video to GoPros Sinha
form video codec thanks to its GPU
acceleration we could get that same
performance that we saw in the demo with
no significant loss in quality on our
video editing desktops here at the
office mirror 6-core extreme editions
you can watch the whole video about all
of that here but then I was thinking to
myself this isn't some wimpy tech
channel list as why is Turk turns so we
decided to amp it up a notch we
approached Asus to sponsor a deeper
investigation and answer this question
once and for all
although admittedly it's one no one has
ever asked me can you edit 4k video on
an ultra portable laptop let's find out
okay so let's start with a look at the
machine that we had us to send us for
science
the Zenbook ux302 you there were a
couple of key things we were looking for
one while not necessarily an ultrabook
by Intel's definition it had to be ultra
portable it wouldn't even press anyone
if we pulled a full fledged gaming
laptop or portable workstation like a g7
51 out of a backpack and started editing
video on it number two we needed a
discrete GPU that is to say a standalone
one not quiet and hard to notice one
Intel's onboard graphics have made great
strides but a dedicated graphics card in
this case one with CUDA support is going
to do more for most GPU accelerated
workloads than onboard can and we need
as much power as we can get if we're
going to have any hope of editing 4k and
finally 3 we needed enough CPU
horsepower and memory to support video
editing at all so we went for a config
with an Intel skylake core i7 6500 you
with 12 gigs of RAM but is that even
enough well we started with a base line
by taking 4k footage right off our sony
FS 5 dumping it into a time line and
trying to edit it abominable I mean CPU
usage was pegged at a hundred percent
right away to the point where we were
measuring performance in seconds per
frame not frames per second a 7s2
footage didn't fare much better with
better CPU usage but up to a four second
delay when moving the playhead to a new
spot on the timeline yuck but that's
what we expected so we had a desktop
machine transcode 4k footage to Sidda
form 4k using Adobe Media encoder and
copied it over the network to the local
disc on the notebook and whoa friends
CPU and GPU usage at full 4k resolution
in the preview window was sitting at 70
and 90% or more respectively with choppy
but at least consistent playback not bad
dialing the preview window down to half
resolution yields
sniffing reduction in CPU and GPU use
with one-quarter resolution running it
anywhere from 27 to 30 FPS with
responsive timeline scrubbing and 1/8
able to run at 30fps solid now it should
be noted that framerate dips were
observed across all preview resolutions
when additional layers were added so the
experience is not absolutely perfect but
when I popped the big question to Ed
could you let it 4k comfortably on this
setup the answer was yeah but hold the
phone - you're ignoring one of the
biggest bottlenecks in the video editing
process the export of the finished file
actually I'm not ignoring it at all so
there's a couple of different ways you
can tackle it with a watch folder
configuration on your desktop you can
finish the file export it in cinah form
drop it in there and have that desktop
deal with it but what we also discovered
is that that didn't actually end up much
faster if at all than just exporting in
h.264 anyway thanks again to GPU
acceleration so you can see I'm actually
running an export right now this is a
two-minute file that's going to finish
in about 17 to 20 minutes and with GPU
usage pegged at 100% it is using the GPU
whoo but copying all the project files
to a portable device to work on them and
then copying them back or whatever isn't
going to appear in an advertising
brochure for a thin enlight anytime soon
with wireless connectivity everywhere
and the cloud people are getting used to
the idea of just working off of network
data and not having to store anything
locally on their machines and while you
won't be editing 4k video over the
internet anytime soon
I wanted to investigate further to see
if we could at least edit directly off
of the drive of the more powerful
machine or a storage machine somewhere
else using a home wireless router so
step one was to enable maximum
performance in the power profiles of the
machine and step two was to plug in a
wired network USB adapter so I used the
100 mega
one that was in the box and the
experience was subpar we're talking five
frames per second regardless of the
playback resolution running off the low
speed Wi-Fi in our office yeah that was
a similar story but our xi3 access
points are not designed for blistering
speed therefore range and consistency so
we did make some useful observations
here though we've got low CPU usage on
our 4k footage and higher CPU usage on
the 1080p footage that was mixed into
our timeline indicating ample processing
power and a bottleneck somewhere else
because this is one of the challenges of
cinah form the file sizes are actually
larger than the footage directly off the
camera in many cases so we were easily
exceeding our connection speed with a
100 megabit wired connection and our
office Wi-Fi so I grabbed a third-party
gigabit USB to Ethernet adapter and boom
timeline performance got responsive and
we were back up to performance that was
pretty much indistinguishable from
editing locally progress but that still
involves a wire that's not really the
point could we do it with Wi-Fi so I
dusted off a wireless AC 1300 megabit
access point these typically run around
150 to 200 bucks for a good one like the
tp-link google onhub one that we checked
out recently and took another crack at
it there we go
boo freaking yeah 300 mega bit through
put while scrubbing footage about the
same is on our wired connection and
again pretty much indistinguishable
performance on Wi-Fi compared to editing
locally and while there are some caveats
you're not going to be able to get this
kind of performance if you're 200 feet
away from your access point what we have
managed to do here is validate that it's
possible to edit 4k video on a thin and
light at your dining room table with a
mere dual-core core i7
if you pick the right configuration
namely
one with strong Wi-Fi we tried the same
experiment on the surface book and it
was not nearly as successful and a
dedicated GPU that parts important
because even at one-quarter resolution
in our preview window GPU usage on our
940m was sitting at 30 to 40 percent and
we were pegging it when we were
exporting finished files speaking of
graphics cards and video things
what about graphics and other cool video
things like video blocks video blocks
provides affordable premium stock video
and they've been doing it since 2011
they operate on a subscription-based
unlimited library and they add new
footage to the library twice per month
they've got over and brace ourselves
here 10 million dollars worth of footage
After Effects templates and motion
backgrounds and everything in video
blocks is unlimited library is 100%
royalty-free
and yours to use for personal and
commercial projects they recently
launched a new Members Only video
marketplace as an added benefit for
subscribers and they've got clips from
contributors around the world that are
only available to videoblocks
subscribers so contributors on that
marketplace by the way keep 100% of the
sales as commissioned video blocks takes
no cut since the marketplace is members
only so they're already supported by
their subscription revenue they've
already got 1500 plus artists with more
than 200,000 new clips in the few months
since the marketplace launched and if
all that sounds pretty darn good you can
get access to the unlimited library and
the marketplace for only $99 per year
but if you use our link which you can
find in the video description box below
its down there and if you sign up during
the month of December clocks a-tickin so
you should do it quickly you will get
one year video blocks for only $49 a
savings of well $50 to put that in
context one clip of stock video footage
similar to those found on video blocks
can be bought for as much as 50 bucks
are actually more depending on what
you're using it for so if you use the
service once your subscription pays for
itself go check it out today
