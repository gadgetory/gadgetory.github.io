the new D brand grip
learn more at the link below my hometown
a there's a better use market where I'm
at there's more population it's more of
a hub of a lot of the the tech companies
and the PC space there's there's just
parts everywhere it's easy to get parts
micro Center is there as well which is
really good in a pinch if you need a
really cheap part or really cheap CPU or
something but I think ultimately it
would have been easier to get people to
come to us if we could smooth talk them
because everyone has cars where it seems
like most people we're interacting with
in Vancouver don't have cars so it was
really hard to get people to come to us
but just the use market as a whole being
more full of parts that are available
would have made this I think a little
bit easier yes we yesterday yeah we
wrote a bunch of emails at the end of
the day hoping they'd respond 60cc guy
never made money back right I'm like
dude call me why did you show up you
know we can make this happen like be
flake still not convinced that's not -
right don't like but even if it isn't
whatever it's right the bottom line is
it's not a thing yeah so I got an email
from two people paired we got two emails
weren't at the card when he still had
the graphics card and we're about to you
located so I gotta respond to him I came
in last night at 11:00 and then this
Dave Ebers guy he responded to me like
right end of the day yesterday he's out
in Port Moody but he said he'll come to
us he says I will make it down before
lunch time probably around 11:30 and
give a phone number yo that's awesome
yeah let's call him right now at the
beginning of today we still had to sell
the graphics card we still had to
hopefully get the SSD from Amazon and we
still had to acquire a better than just
the Intel stock cooler CPU cooler hey
yeah you emailed me about my gtx 660 oh
good good yeah we're totally down would
you like to meet us like at my place or
like a coffee shop near here or
something like that
whichever doesn't matter to me they're
easier for you I guess oh you coffee
shop I guess that's easier um do you
want to meet at being around the world
I'm Brandon
once on Grandville cool and then meet
there around 11:30 you were thinking
okay great okay see you then Cheers all
right so we're not a two bucks that was
easy
eighty-three tea and that's why it was
we decided yesterday it was gonna be a
risk like okay do we order the tea to
now or do we wait because we we could
have still ordered up till like from an
hour from now still got roughly about
there yeah yeah but now now we have to
start finding a big cooler it's a 23
minute walk that's closer than where we
went yesterday to sell to pick up the
card she does the dark row three it's
normally ninety bucks so that guy would
bring it to us for a tea so that's a big
fat double stack that might be worth
getting I mean let me email that guy
back right now yeah and see like okay
can you bring it to us for a tea yeah
because that's his asking price mm-hmm
he says unfortunately because this was a
response to email you wrote him
yesterday when you said hey they're been
looking for something cool with MI CPU
produces 70 bring out to us or 60 if we
go to you right and then his response
was hello unfortunately I'm not going to
come out to Ben for less than what I'm
asking for if you're able to come to
Syria can do 70 let me know works for
you it works tallow balm in a bit so now
we just match his actually him doing us
a favor and braid to us for the same
price yeah I'm totally cool with that so
I'm gonna write him back and say we do
need the 80
this guy sounds super legit but I'm
writing back right now and even see if
he'll agree to it yeah sure yeah we
always bail so we might have legit
nothing to do tomorrow like during the
build phase overclocking cleaning the
system out
let's hope it doesn't go pop it's not
blowing stuff up we can't spend all of
our sanity worrying about what the other
team has so we just have to go with what
we've got put it together
what's together but we need to just
present it and either way it was a lot
of fun we'd like to win but again as
time goes on in this competition you
really start to second-guess yourself
and then use your confidence kind of
starts to diminish over time and I think
that's kind of where we are right now so
then it seems pretty legit that maybe
that wasn't him I don't think it was him
there's always the scuppered worst
conspiracy stuff it's the uncertainty
that really makes you start to wonder
and then you start to believe this stuff
in your head like well that's why this
makes sense you know because he would do
that to make us lose time so just an
update on the Amazon owner for the SSD
it went out for delivery to the shipment
center at 2:31 a.m. and then had its
arrival scan at 4:01 a.m. and then was
set out to delivery to bring it here at
7:10 a.m. I have all that on the Amazon
app so theoretically it's gonna show up
don't know exactly what time but until
we have it in hand we can't like feel
like we're done yeah I'm pretty sketched
out and we're about to blow the rest of
our money on the cooler oh yeah I know
if this isn't show if he leaves yeah how
are we with emails there is not what we
do have a couple we do have a couple
offers on the monitor well excellent but
I would sincerely like to make sure that
it works before we before we sell it and
we need to do some budgeting here man
because right now we had a solid plan
for how we were gonna get
maybe unbeatable hardware but the
problem was that we started the day with
the hardware that we needed to sell to
get the unbeatable hardware possibly not
working okay if we hitchhike both ways
we have 62 dollars okay it's what a
two-hour hitchhike
no actually hitchhiking would probably
be faster than transit because it's a
45-minute Drive one and a half hour
transit run yeah so if we hitchhike both
ways we have 62 dollars which means that
we have to pay anything to the driver as
a compensation I don't think that's
typical we could offer them some bread
it's really quite delicious only a
couple hairs in it yeah only a couple
yeah I'm the only one that we found so
the backup motherboard we've got a phone
number his day is wide open and he would
want to meet at a fairly nearby Sky
train station so if we have to go get
the backup motherboard assuming that we
do actually have $100 still 90 degrees
yep yep
oh I think yeah okay maybe one depends
on the CPU cooler just missing
misaligned I think says it's like the
push push pins I think it's gonna be a
simple fix we discovered that one of the
brackets was broken in half and also
that was not allowing the contact
between the CPU and CPU cooler to be
proper and our CPU wasn't like ninety
degrees Celsius unless we hold it down
and we're not gonna do that up until
that point we thought that getting a new
CPU cooler was a nice to have not a
must-have and what we should do let's
use our EVGA poster for our hitchhiking
sign
I was wondering how we were gonna get
paper going to Surrey like do we how do
we suggest people that where we need to
go we just type in going to where we
need to go no money need hardware oh the
guy with the Xeon says oh no if you can
wait he could meet at brain sky train
station but only if we can wait till
5:30 or 6:00 oh yeah no it's okay we'll
just have to we'll just have to do it to
go there earlier or to go there or not
to go at all no no what we'd have to go
earlier I think we got to do it I'm also
hearing back from someone on the monitor
he says okay let me know how the other
offers work
wait a minute you fell off I didn't say
there were other offers oh my god is it
the guys upstairs I wonder if they sent
us multiple offers
that's okay though because we don't need
any more money but it would be nice
right because we don't have enough money
for the motherboard no but we also don't
necessarily need the motherboard what's
what's our team name we could go with
Dimitri tech tips we could go with Linus
Canucks we could go with I don't know
kind of flexible let's do what Demetrius
Demetrius but we need a Linus in there
some are do ya than us oh I see okay so
do meet us like this
yeah that actually is like kind of up
how that's kind of a powerful name on
let go
we just received two reviews Oh my
review Johnny curl quick response is
still waiting for the purchase lots of
questions at this point
what oh I got three three stars let go
and he's reviewed two of my purchases
what maybe I should review them yeah the
right asks a lot of questions bad liar
it's No Cash Money here's the monitor
powered on if you want to meet in the
next 30 minutes I'll be around near VG
age can I get your email so we can text
instead of email oh we might be getting
rid of the monitor right now sweet and
where did you find the cable for it oh I
just borrowed one off over yet your
stuffs not charging next I want the
shadow rock the shadow rock has a lot
more cooling potential I think they said
oh really yes like quite worried
that's something could if we if we push
comes to shove leaving those two sticks
get everything running or one stick to
get everything running and then at the
workshop just Dremel off the parts that
stick up on them
but if it's heatpipe so we can totally
know on the on the ramp we just yeah we
could do that because they're just
spires yeah yeah we could do that you
just bang it on probably yeah I'm not
really like second-guessing our build
I'm just trying to figure out like the
290s is the thing that can be done
Finnick
that's the only thing that could be us
or 382 90s so all of our stuff is gonna
fit on our SSD once it shows up we're
not worried about storage space anymore
which is good his guys said he would
come to us where can we meet so it
sounds me like he has a car right if you
didn't have a car you would like hey can
you meet at the station
yeah probably he might end up being like
oh can we meet closer to his station but
it sounds like he has a car I'm also
possibly not expecting to hear from him
until around 3 o'clock because if he's
like I'm not free till 3 maybe he just
messaged me at work which I think we're
safe to wait for because we could still
make it to NCA X and back in that amount
of time so the only 26 minute walk it's
not a big deal so we're gonna wait oh so
we have a backup if that drive for some
have some reason gets lost resident show
up I'm all for just like leaving that
one did not say anything and let him
find out when your watches I fit really
dead serious we were like single teams
that's exactly what I would do - really
badly wants to run ashes on a very high
preset which is something that we just
like don't do
because we still think he has SLI yeah
probably because he's running a slide
980 ice not going that way
that's the waterfront we don't want that
it's going this way yeah 550 we start
considering other options bus to NCIX
they close at what 6:00 probably about
then yeah we have enough time to get
there barely it's all we gotta do is get
in the door right you might end up being
late though yeah
I mean saying as long as we get in the
door they're right they close at 6:00
it's like 555 they strike would either
we have to then we'd be late back yeah I
said it bunch of times we got to figure
out what the penalty is if we're late
back today we can talk to Ed basically a
scrap system that's like the best we can
get for like nothing so that's why we
were like we want to get this up man so
you recognize this yeah we gotta balance
like immediately though yeah we got it
we got to get on the bus now so thanks a
lot man we appreciate it
it says 26 minutes on the bus from here
yeah so Amazon delivery driver just
called me and was like hey I'm at your
address says the wrong address by the
way I verified it in the app it's right
and like the owner of this house doesn't
know who you are and then the owner
grabs the phone and it's like hey yeah
I'm from this address so I checked my
phone just to make sure that I type I
said the wrong one check the Amazon app
they're saying the wrong thing he just
tried to give the SSC to someone that
wasn't us luckily the guy that you've
had to give it to you apparently awesome
dude
told them that it wasn't the right place
now the Amazon driver is apparently
driving to where we are trying to go
right now
so hopefully the SSD will be grown time
hello if you're facing the house you
should see steps that go down and then
there's like if you look to the right
there's like a swinging bench that's
just inside the property it's the one on
the left
it's the one on the left it is the house
on the left is the unit on the left
sorry no do not take it back with you
it's it's the house on the bottom floor
I I'm not entirely sure what to tell you
it's actually not that complicated if
you're facing the houses if you look to
your left it is the one furthest to the
left right yeah it's a great thins
there's a gray fence there's there's a
step or two that goes down and then once
you look to your right there's two tiny
little like kid sized chairs and then a
wooden bench okay awesome if you leave
it under the wooden bench that would be
great the address I guess got
autocorrected by Amazon so it actually
was like slightly down the street
instead of right actually here so they
ended up bringing it to the wrong house
and then luckily oh my goodness luckily
the guy that was there was like my name
isn't Luke you brought this to the wrong
house so it's actually working out
everything's gonna come back together in
the last like it's just on there I
totally put it under it but like at
least it's there
oh okay what so what time is it
5:40 at 5:40 we got our last part so we
made it back with 20 minutes to spare we
got our dark rock pro3
which funnily enough when Linus and
Dmitry were walking in I saw that they
were also carrying a black be quiet box
about this size so it would be it would
be pretty funny if we both at the very
last minute on the very mmm essentially
last day got the same cooler although I
don't know how they got theirs because
if they have the same one because we
only saw one listing for it so I wonder
if they bought it new that would be
really interesting because I think this
would be the first time that anyone
bought anything new discovery was also
our SST came in
there it is boom hundred and twenty
gigabytes of SSD goodness so we're good
to go
that's all of our parts tomorrow we need
to install the cooler install the SSD
migrate all the files that are currently
on our SSD over to this SSD and then
it's just benchmarking time let's go it
is illegal to hitchhike here ok then
we're screwed
or a six-hour hike oh my god it's so far
we have to transfer three times it is
this all buses bus train nope
and then bus to bosses at one train we
might get away with one fare then so we
tell the bus for getting on the train
right we pay for the Train then we train
the bus bus back onto the train and
hopefully we're good yeah as long as you
were back on the same route to go back
in the same platform yeah okay okay okay
everything's getting real
so I'm asking the six core guy if you
can bring it to Coquitlam centre which
would probably save us a fare back the
girl with the combo for the CPU
motherboard and RAM he's trying to
negotiate on price but I'm holding firm
but what that would mean is that we
could sell that whole combo for a
hundred and fifty five dollars which
even after we go buy our motherboard
again would give us a hundred and fifty
six dollars for a cooler so I messaged
the guy in Richmond asking how much to
deliver of course sir a JT so we can
fight basically let's find every cooler
we can and see if we can pay someone 10
or 20 bucks to deliver
yeah he just confirmed
into it deliver Oh that the Xeon he's
bringing out the guys Elin guys bringing
it to the bus depot we are almost there
we're like
yeah oh this is exciting
okay so so we got to pay him 150 450
let's get that ready okay sorry hit me
Kimmy before agreed to sell our 960 and
the motherboard in the RAM combo
let's verify that the Xeon and the RAM
work yes on that motherboards in the day
in work on that motherboards should we
still do the swap
the p60 is a better board and works with
a high bandwidth bridge but we should go
get the p6t deluxe right from here
before we even go back we have enough
money
we do as long as we sell that stuff away
oh crap no I'm gonna ask that guy if he
can deliver okay they're negotiating
they want 150 for the whole lot what is
that that's $5 off okay I can't meet
until late this afternoon
okay so CPU motherboard RAM combo guy or
gal wants to meet at 5:30 so that's
perfect
because by then we'll be done
some point Linus and Dimitri managed to
get the motherboard seller to drop his
price 50 box down to an even 100
although it looks like even that might
be just out of their price range is it
because we're paying this guy the
delivery fee yeah
did we already verify that we haven't
gonna pay him wait wait hold on
supporter shoot excellence Z on W 3670
yup alright thank you
right and we got the AHA no just kidding
okay looks fine I'm sure it's fine he
seems like a trustworthy gentleman
alright so I have 150 I recognized your
voice
Oh
and then this is clear if I collect
claims good something
are you sure I'm sure you sure okay okay
okay thank you so much take care okay so
he did not take there's no 475 which
means we're good with money
we got the exactly 100 dollars now but I
heard him messages a guy asking if he
can take okay well maybe write him back
I'm just gonna be like guys five bucks
on the side of the road okay okay yeah
six chords young guy kind of saved our
butts he didn't end up charging us to
come and meet us at the sky train
station which was really nice oh my god
we're like a dollar short we're less
than a dollar short we're like we're
like twenty thirty cents short
okay instead we had 99 dollars and
seventy cents like 75 cents so I didn't
feel too bad about that
yeah we're I think we're good if I
message him back and like look we've got
99 dollars and 70 cents he should be
okay okay I have 99 dollars and 70 cents
and 30 cents ain't one
super stressed out on our way to meet
the hundred dollar motherboard guy
though because we couldn't get in touch
with him stupid me I didn't realize I
actually had a phone number after all
but then I called the number and it was
like a landline and I was like who uses
a landline hi I was calling about that
motherboard and you said you were gonna
try and get in touch with them oh well
that's fantastic great thank you and
you'll be there well we're at what
station are ya we're at Brentwood town
center now and so we just need to
transfer so we'll be there when we get
there the NCIX Broadway location is
walking distance from my aunt's house
and it's actually no we won't have any
money to buy it on the way back it's so
our motherboard CPU Ram block first so
what we would have to do basically is
arrange with that yeah well should we
give the motherboard go home and test it
yes
and then agree to the sale and then
agree to the sale yeah I mean
technically we've already agreed to the
sale so it's deciding whether to back
out of the sale
right so we're okay with time yeah well
our bus transfers are still good for 40
minutes so tense
I knew that Linus would be you know
luring me into the water situation by
saying we will get you in water but I
was smarter than that I brought my own
water for the whole day but I felt bad
cos line is didn't have any
okay so we're meeting at the tea and tea
we heard from him while we were on the
train I was like yeah did you get my
message about the 99 dollar 70 cents
he's like no I didn't but it's cool
don't worry about it so that's great
also get this this is only a 15-minute
detour
even if our transfers expire so in 25
minutes
even if we don't catch a bus closer to
my aunt's place we are still only 15
minutes out if we walk compared to if we
had just bust back to her place so
things are going worked out really well
right now that's the best time to know
the city is when you actually get the
public transport you explore via Google
Maps walking yeah cuz otherwise we're
gonna have to walk back to my aunt's
place so yeah enjoy so we're meeting him
right in front of the TNT here
and he's coming on an electric scooter
he said he was about six minutes away
about five minutes ago so any moment now
we give to a shadow oh yeah good call
we always hide in the shadows oh yes all
right cool oh okay perfect
wow that is quite the packaging you got
there
that's nothing I get comments all the
time on the dick pad on the back of my
car okay
so theoretically we can bus back in
it'll say this 20 minutes next thing do
you want a busted you want to walk let's
bus okay so are we on the street where
we can think of us okay here we got a
walk we got a walk down a bit okay yeah
but right here yes so this is this way
we gotta go
wait so the TNT is supposed to be on our
left so we need to go this way go up
yeah that way so motherboard combo will
meet us at NCIX but can't get there till
5:30 or maybe a little bit after it's a
25-minute walk back to the house okay so
here we go I said look if you're a
little bit late to be 100% honest the
issue is that I don't have the money to
buy the thing until after we meet you so
if you can give me and my friend a ride
to ncx and it doesn't matter if you're a
few minutes late oh that's perfect what
did they say it looks like that's good
to go amazing
know you'll get a drag here so we get to
ncx store and we wait for him this was a
5:30 so timing it was very close or
freaking out a little bit so lioness on
the poster at the NZXT store so that was
a little bit you know he still had a
little bit of a messy hair and the
screwdriver but then the guy finally
shows up we get our money run to the
store to buy the CPU cooler which was
already prepared and we're on our way it
was the last piece of the puzzle for the
build very happy how it turned out so
deep friend is calling their new case
the grip for a reason well a couple of
reasons number one sitting on a plane
will prop up your phone watch movie Oh
bad idea with a grip case good idea
reason number two say you leave your
phone on the hood of your car or
something by accident you're getting in
you don't want it to slide off while
you're driving right it's the grittiest
case freaking ever reason number three
actually nothing to do with the grip
part of it at all it just has full phone
protection so you can like scratch it
around on stuff and do this and you can
like drop it whatever you guys have been
seeing it in scrapyard Wars for three
weeks you've been asking for it and now
it's finally here
go buy a D brand grip today at the link
in the video description heading into
the final day Luke and Jai aren't
feeling too confident while but this is
scrapyard wars than it ain't over till
it's over
don't say the court wrong go to the cool
do you know the glorious
no good job everyone just cuz I am your
father but he's correcting him yeah yeah
don't go that way it's other things were
popular yeah
so hey - where's the dremel is it like
probably upstate okay okay so what you
can probably do right now is leave one
fan off put two of these in and just
keep going and then I'll work on lines
what's the least unsafe way to do this
Luke hurt himself he's gonna file a
claim I don't think I'm gonna bleed
yeah no it's already breathing for the
offensive end it's gone it broke the
stem of it broke
I mean either the stem of it came right
off I think we were sabotage it fire it
out and hit me in the shoulder
food that looks so much nicer than even
needs to that's awesome now at this
point they're both supposed to be
benchmarking but it seems like both
teams still have some finishing touches
to put on but I would still always
recommend even AIO just because of the
ease of installation versa yeah
well that's the biggest thing with the
iOS in my opinion remember we bought the
be quiet cooler on your recommendation
it's gonna perform very well I told you
that the mounting mechanism was shite
but you wanted the duel tower yeah so
which way do we which we go maybe you're
just a big be quiet fanboy I am five I
just hate having so much memory and
right I can't get at the a pin with this
stupid ginormous cooler in here it's
like why are water coolers popular when
they don't perform better this is why
the cable bones connected to the head or
bone the header bones connected to the
motherboard bone the leather bar bones
connected to the case bone the case
bones connected to the table bone the
table bones connected to the floor bone
I think this is probably the first
scrapyard wars where I regret nothing
so Linus I have I have a gift for you
you have a gift that is gonna be used to
either for you to keep for yourself or
use them as an accessory for this case
oh that is beautiful
and you know what I don't think it
counts as being part of the system if we
put it next to if we put it next to the
system yes and right
this is so great look at this look how
curious it's not turning so maybe nobody
know why it was so tight I get to turn
it off it's off it's shutting down
so it's off
I could start playing with the overclock
down there on the CPU if you want to but
I need the system drive so you wouldn't
be able to test it nobody I can atleast
start checking where I can boot you want
me to do that see if some time so right
now I'm hoping that Paragon disk image
software works on Windows 8 because my
computer is still Windows 8 Paragon disk
image software which is what we're
planning to move all of this stuff from
our test drive to our Ashville drive
doesn't work on Windows 10 so we're
gonna see if I can mirror everything
over using Windows 8 as the host drive
yeah like we have a drive that works
it's just not our drive so like if I can
verify that our SSD works then they
might be cool with us just using the
other one because it's not actually
impactful on performance but I want to
like I haven't even verified that it
works yet and so like if I haven't
verified that it works they'll be like
what because that's fair if they're
higher than 85% of our score I'll be
pretty surprised well we've got some
really important stuff to do while this
is running where do you want to put this
you toot you choose it you choose the
place of honor here let's see well
normally on and the glue gun it would go
like here but that's not really visible
right yeah do you want it kind of like
we need like release of honor yeah we're
like cover and it might get stuck in
here though it's kind of a perfectly
good you know case yeah
dial it was the dial full yeah if you
want an extra light hearing it that's
that's perfect
do you like that yes buddy wait that
means that we're ruining 9:20
I think it's okay yeah this is 100% so
yeah okay so we got a position that's
square yeah so it's perfect I like
that's how you know it's the correct let
it let it go a little a little bit Oh
what what is that can really just
position this guy here from now we'll
just we'll step it back a little bit and
we'll be glad that we ran these
benchmarks before we had to submit to
judging you can there it is it works
fine yep it works great okay so it might
be cool with us just using it in the
interest of saving time yeah sure we'll
we can we can bend the rules I would
consider that bending as long as they're
SSD actually works and could hold all
the stuff if it came to that okay I
think after this coin and after this
thing finished we can do it all right
there's a little there's a little
present for the judges you know oh I get
stuck jammed oh no it ate our no wait
this is like an arcade machine oh I see
it eat it
do you have yeah I can see it right
there guys we need the pliers back
oh my god are they make nutty I don't
remember if canoes are magnetic oh oh
wait wait I fix it no we're good we're
good
oh no I don't need them thanks ed Luke
quit panicking uh uh no no I'm panicking
at all but I feel like I'm gonna leave
the voltage higher higher yeah pretty
much
okay oh crap it does melt it a little
what did that just sister me not what
happened what what you know what I'm
kind of getting cold feet on the on the
CPU okay oh okay let's just I'm just
gonna dial it back a couple notches just
the last thing I want is for us to not
run our benchmarks yeah if we if we
don't want that oh if we don't complete
yeah I think we have to go back to start
okay so it's been which would be really
bad actually for our config there we go
now that is a control knob
we're really close yes two minute we're
ready to test a benchmark test the
benchmark I mean
are they ready yeah are they ready yeah
it is to check double check on options
here
regarding a problem
it would suck for us to be like okay
every time when they let us season it
drove and I don't I don't really want to
do that because yeah I think what
how much longer do you guys think you
need because we're like I don't want to
say the magic word to trigger Edie we
are in a state at which we could do
things but you guys were bros of both
the drive things we don't want to do
over okay we could sit down for a little
while we are a state at which we don't
need to touch the computer effort for
any major significant reason you're
ready
I don't know words that start with our
no I'm still Ian lunch we're good okay
we're good we're ready we are ready for
them to meet dimitra's the goddess the
God of gaming what all right come on wow
this is rather anticlimactic do better
next time a prime now it's time to see
which one of these is the more powerful
build Demetrios or the green machine is
that our dark rock probe it is not we
went and got that at the exact same time
you guys got yours we don't know like 10
minutes earlier getting the exact same
item and we're really curious as to
where you got yours because this was the
only one like that we found online what
I mean the only one this is the only
dark rock pro 3 on the Craigslist I
thought so
see I called that that's right we got
enough money so we can yeah France right
you yeah we have so much sponsor money
from putting our D brand fault oh yeah
look around the back
yeah oh you got some fiber always
putting his D brand deep Randall I can
counter this I can sell up I can sell
out harder than you Brandon where's your
big things your big flag okay hold on
here here's our D brand MacBook and
alienware and here's my personal phone
which also has D bread to be cheap do
meet you where's your MacBook I don't
have anything that's your person
actually who can sell out harder yeah
that's right oh yeah all that D brand
your personal phone is skin too isn't it
yeah yeah well I have like whole TV this
V you benchmarks
we've got Cinebench and Adobe Media
encoder
I bet our system is pretty different
from what you guys think it is yep I bet
I bet your system is super slow well
that's not really a bet when you're
making an observation actually it's not
that no it's not that far off is it well
we start odds behind I didn't realize he
started it when he did we started first
I don't think it's enough well these
this is a slow pass here though down
this right handsome oh okay
what do you guys got 933 912 whoa so for
the camera the way the scoring works
though is that by being 20 points behind
that's only 2 percent so effectively we
get 10 marks they get 9.8 this is really
close
ok beam so up if you guys yeah ok ok 3 2
1 go
ok this time we started at the same time
so it should be a fairer fighter we're
already ahead it's crazy
Oh anytime 303 236 and I think our bar
is ahead of there's two it's kind of
hard to tell to be fair but yeah I think
we're like a scene behind whole trappin
over quite a bit behind there like here
oh yeah what are the rules on that I
think you have to okay
I think you have to just kind of things
with it
what are you know it's 20 seconds huh
four minutes are there sorry for 43 43
we're at 5:17 yeah okay okay so after
the CPU benchmarks the green beast is
ahead by three percent three two one
I think this is where we're gonna lose
there any percent what we're gonna be
like alright good game I certainly hope
so
that's just yours is so slow at loading
well you know what
it isn't how you load the game it's how
you play the game get a more proper
process you know mister proper processor
we won one of the CPU benchmarks was
straight up also you were telling me
about how this is always choppy because
of the I didn't say choppy I just said
it that part of the test is you said it
always does that I mean it clearly
doesn't always do that because 35 FPS
was so fast I mean if we want that
cinematic look you know what though that
works the FPS Luke oh the FBI does it
still work
yeah the FPS is not as high as I
expected it to be though it's pretty
monstrously high and it's higher there
so I don't know what you're talking
about man like it could have throttled
oh yeah that job that Jeff like 600
points
you guys can run it again if you want
I'm not you know known to be to my own
detriment pretty lenient with the other
team if they need more time do you like
our symbolic way you brought that okay
that's not actually part of our system
but our system has another really crazy
trick because I bet you haven't even
seen it so far look well there it is
there's a system I am I was wrong about
your platform I wonder if I was right
about your platform before you changed
it but I'm I was wrong about your
platform that's closer to what we got
before 54 66 you guys are probably
around 6,000 well why don't we find out
oh damn okay so fire strikes core we got
seven thousand nine hundred twenty nine
and the green beast pulled in five
thousand four hundred and sixty two so
that puts us at four point eight and
then at four point four so we went from
being three percent behind to just under
ten percent ahead three two one hit it I
never run fire strikes oh I legitimately
actually don't know what they're running
but you don't run fire strike well like
the system didn't lock the game just
stopped going oh is the system working
yeah we have the cursor is relatively
okay well let you guys uh let you guys
figure out your stuff there but I think
it's uh I think the audience would know
which machine they'd want to be using by
this point in time I know everything's
just going exactly according to plan you
know what maybe there's this going
according to plan - maybe our plan was
just to have everything run perfectly
and their plan was to kind of you know
dick around I should call them team
Green Machine dick around Libby laughs
so partway through the ashes a single
instant rose ashes didn't even
technically freeze though knows the
cursor came up yeah
so it just like stopped the benchmark it
was like a soft lock and then I went to
go kill it with ctrl delete and it
didn't say that it was hanging yeah you
know what we do have a UPS shut it down
again let's just make sure maybe you
guys are just kind of borderline
confident that everything's going great
the whole time both of us that's custom
each is a yes man well if things were
going the way that they were going for
us you'd have been a yes man - I don't
know why do you make a last-minute
switch in your whole system it wasn't
not a last-minute switch yeah it was a
planned switch last-minute
I like this guy that is some that is
some world-class spin doctoring right
there all right guys average frame rate
all that's just 50.0 what do we want to
verify settings are you sure you did it
right it's nothing worth noting that we
are exploiting let's just say the
developers Rex there's a specific reason
why a lot of people use ashes when
testing multiple GPUs that are on a
certain team the tomb raider so with the
way it's going right now green beast is
about 5% ahead at six point eight versus
six point five god and one of them is
heavily I know leaning the other way
will still lose but that's fun it makes
you closer
there's a lot of stuttering on both
sides anyway when it looks over that
mountain it likes to do that even with
really good systems whether you inside
the cave let's see how what happens I
saw a bunch of sitting right there but
nobody wrong screen a bunch of wobbling
yeah okay oh I saw stuttering your
eyesight ours yeah I didn't
what do you think - what's your opinion
you're more in the middle than anyone I
think ours is running smoother but I
don't think it's by as much as I'd like
our benchmark is gonna end significantly
sooner overall is only fifty three point
four sixty one point six one it's a
significant amount so I think they're
gonna be ahead by like five percent
again so we got sixty one point six one
and they got fifty three point four
which puts us at a dead heat eight point
two two eight point two wait a second
hold on no we've got a problem with the
formula I put them up I copied the
formula wait a second wait a second okay
okay there was a formula error so we're
actually ahead but only by what like two
percent seven point seven to seven point
six going into the last benchmark I
stand by what I said you did better than
I thought we would and there are there
are lots of benefits to the way we did
our system as to why we do them you guys
know to start from the benchmark okay
because this is only one left right yeah
scene one okay here we go hit it you
might as well hit it earlier Dimitri
it's gonna start way later Oh No
yeah they're faster I was reading it
wrong whoa they're fluctuating a lot
yeah I know that what's up with your
system bro why is it running so bad
right now I want to plug into the ups
hold on man winning would be weird
there's one setting that we forgot to
check off the hashes might have made a
difference
this was disabled no it doesn't matter
for DirectX 11 oh yeah
so it doesn't matter all right let's see
it yeah
with a bear somehow stable it is
that's the same as last time
yeah
eight point nine eight to nine point two
two oh we were so worried from day two
forward a hundred percent okay good job
guys good team
well played sorry Dimitri alright with a
score of nine point two two nine
effectively rounding here you are
congratulations you walked a long way
and where you started but with a winning
computer that looks just like me
and Dimitri second good effort at least
your pedometer is happy so again
congratulations congratulations
well played oh sorry why I already shook
your hand one trick his name was - all
right so that's it
Dimitri I let you down I'm sorry bro
really you have not let me down
it was great I think we have a good
system yeah well at least you got to be
on the show - yeah and congratulations
you guys once more thanks for coming out
and
thanks for watching basically they got
rekt thanks for watching scrapyard wars
he can retire now he's lost you know a
lot that might have been a little hard
this is a regular phone this is a
gripped phone this is for comedic effect</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
