very recently however there is one game
that is uh so somewhat consequential
importance to the gaming world you know
a few people might buy this game and it
is Call of Duty Black Ops and so this
game was not out until the same time as
the GTX 580 which means I wasn't able to
benchmark it and release results for it
along with my full review so I am just
going to show you guys a quick rundown
of the settings the graphical settings
I'm going to be using to test this
particular new title and so I'm gonna
actually run it with GTX 580 SLI GTX 580
s I'm gonna run it with the 480 I'm
gonna run it with my 460 sli setup and
then I'm also going to run it with the
58 70 and 5870 crossfire setup so stay
tuned and you can find out on my
particular test platform so I'll do a
quick rundown of that for you guys if
you don't already know I do use a core
i7 8 7 5k overclocked 23.8 1 gigahertz I
use 4 gigs of RAM and I use a cougar SX
series 850 watt power supply and that's
pretty much everything you need to know
about this test platform in terms of its
performance so you can compare the
numbers now I'm going to be doing a
custom run-through where I'm doing a
fraps recording of about 5 minutes of
gameplay I'll be doing it a couple times
to ensure that there's consistency to
the results although the thing about the
Call of Duty campaign is it's very paced
because you follow the guy around so
it's very easy to get consistent results
and I'll be using fraps to record it and
I'll be giving you guys the average
frame rate so stay tuned so I'm just
doing some gameplay footage of some of
the black ops well gameplay that that
I'm using to benchmark these cards you
can see right now I have the 5870
crossfire setup on the bench so I'm
running it on the 30-inch monitor with
the settings that I showed you guys
before like I said it's a pretty
consistent run-through because you can
see that I'm following these guys around
so the pacing is about right and
sorry it's really hard to do these these
narratives when I'm trying to play a
video game at the same time but there's
some pretty good action sequences
there's some some grenades they kill off
explosions happened all kinds of good
stuff I'm playing through it easy and I
apologize for that
but it's far more important from my
perspective to have to have consistency
in the run-through so as opposed to
having it be challenging and then having
my my recording stopped 4 minutes and 30
seconds in and then I have to have to
redo it with that card for that run so
benchmark graphs coming shortly I'm
almost at the end of the run here so
it's from the beginning of the level
up until this point and it should turn
off in just a moment here before I get
to the end of this hallway come on
shouldn't be almost done before I get
the ball away come on
like I said the run-through is very
consistent ok there we go it's done now
ok
so it should be fairly clear from the
graphs that you've seen that even at
2560 by 1600 so that is the highest
resolution of a single monitor that you
can pretty much run these days and with
all the details maxed out I'm just going
to show you guys that again that almost
none of these setups were bottlenecked
by the video card almost all of them ran
into an issue where the limiting factor
was the CPU so that's why we're seeing
the same frame rate between a single GTX
480 and dual GTX 580 s in this game so
pretty much what I'm trying to say is in
regular 2d mode we're not going to run
into any differentiation between these
cards however I have another monitor
here and we're going to be trying this
out so we're gonna run in 3d
stereoscopic mode and we're obviously
not going to be able to use the ATI
cards because right now GeForce is the
only solution for stereoscopic 3d and
black ops so we're going to run the 460
SLI the 480 the 580 and the 580 SLI in
3d stereoscopic can find out if we get
some differentiation between the cards
because stereoscopic 3d is much more
demanding on the GPU than regular
two-dimensional 3d graphics thank you
