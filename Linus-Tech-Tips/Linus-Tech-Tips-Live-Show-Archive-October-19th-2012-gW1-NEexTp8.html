because honestly it's been a bit of a
been a bit of a challenge to set up
tonight I had to move locations and I've
completely changed the way that I'm
doing the whole live capture thing so
traditionally I mean I can't really call
it traditional if I've only really been
doing this for a month but traditionally
I've been using a shuttle PC actually
I'm gonna go let me go find it because
I'm like super mad no some phones going
off right here this one so this is a z68
shuttle PC it's got dual PCI Express
slots so it's got a 16 X and a 4x so I
was like oh HDMI capture PC and then
like it'll be awesome because it'll be
super portable like awesome and stuff
and now what ended up happening is with
my Blackmagic intensity Pro HDMI capture
cards uh yeah it was it was causing blue
screens it was causing just general
incompatibility like I would I would
know that I had the settings right and
then it just wouldn't work at all and it
ended up that the problem was actually
the to some kind of maybe a PCIe timing
and compatibility or something like that
and it just did not work so what I did
was I threw the to capture cards into a
different motherboard in this case it's
in a PhD 77 v premium and everything is
working a hundred percent fine and I
really hope that this stream is working
this is my first time checking on twitch
to make sure it's actually going and it
looks like it is so yay excellent um
crank up the volume crank up the volume
is a it's not a consensus crank up the
volume and yes I'm sorry I'm late guys
I'm very sorry I yeah was having some
trouble that
was not good okay some people are saying
volume is good some people are saying
volume is low so I'm gonna go ahead and
turn it up a little bit I'm just gonna
turn up a little bit okay the camera
audio level here we go okay all right so
I'm gonna try talking again how's that
sound to you guys so we good we good all
right
yes I know there's an echo you know what
too bad there's nothing I can do
I'll all my ears people are either
saying bad kid you know what forget it
you guys I'm leaving it the way it is
just turn your volume down it's really
hard right yes I know the echo is
terrible I'm 100% aware of that trust me
the reason that the echo is terrible is
that the room I'm in has okay you know
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna go over to
the camera here and I'm gonna show you
guys the room I'm in and hopefully I'll
be able to actually fix Mia here I'm
just gonna change the camera completely
to auto mode because I know nothing of
how cameras work I can't I can't even
 I can't even find me I can't even
find the auto mode button yeah there it
is camera auto mode okay so I'm going to
show you guys the room that I'm in I'm
actually going to turn this way so this
is a bare wall this is a hardwood floor
these things are bad for Echo very bad
that's my drying machine and that's my
cat carrier Rumble had to go to the vet
today he's been throwing up so that's
not good
here's my video exception
hmm here's my light here is the room
that's on the other side of the camera
so if you guys have watched any of my
recent videos you may recognize you know
this table and there's always gear sort
of lying around here this table this
fireplace and couches so yeah see these
though bare walls and dude that looks
like a carpet but ah more hardwood
flooring so the problem with hardwood
flooring is that it is very terrible for
echoes so I had a lot of people suggest
in the video that I that I uploaded
before with didn't do with the new set
that I wear a lapel mic and what those
people apparently didn't seem to notice
is that I was wearing a lapel mic so
while I appreciate the suggestion I'm
just gonna get the focus right here well
I appreciate the suggestion what they
should have noticed and all the hi-def
glory that was the the new style video
of setup I had a lapel mic on my shirt
so the lapel mic doesn't dress the issue
of the of the sort of the echo because
it's it's not a shotgun mic that's so
far away from me but it does not address
the problem where if I'm turning to one
side or turning to the other side the
volume changes up and down so what I
really want to do is get a boom mic set
up so that it can sit kind of just under
the shot right here so I can use a
shotgun mic that's very close to me but
then not have to worry about about which
direction I'm facing exactly in order to
get some kind of even lighting guard
even lighting even microphone sound
going on sorry guys it has actually been
the longest week ever and hopefully at
some point I'll be able to share with
you guys exactly exactly what was going
on but yes it's been very very tough
people are asking for the warehouse sale
preview so the only the only thing
can think of right now is that if I were
to upload the warehouse sale preview
then I'm just a little bit concerned
that it will affect the streaming here
that's going on so why don't we just try
it and see what happens
so the warehouse sale preview is just on
my SD card here you guys can you guys
can come along for the ride if you want
see this is my new way of switching
between camera B's see I can switch here
so you can see I'm gonna go into my SD
card and I'm gonna upload this and you
guys are gonna have to let me know in
the twitch chat hopefully if that just
has totally destroyed the streaming are
we still good we're still good okay
sweet looks like no one's complaining
yet so NCI acts October 20th warehouse
sale extravaganza see this is visit
uploaded videos so it's actually not not
rocket science this whole YouTube thing
you just gotta sort of keep at it and
make lots and lots and lots of videos so
visit this link for more I spelled it
wrong for more details whoa so I
actually had a guest film B via
warehouse sale preview if you guys
aren't familiar with what the warehouse
sale is the warehouse sale basically
refers to and once every quarter or so
look try to switch there we go once
every quarter or so NCIX takes all the
open box stuff and hopefully this gives
you guys some idea what happens to some
of the open box stuff that that I open
up so they take all the open box stuff
put it all into like a big room and then
sell it for like half price
so people line up all night in fact I
was there at 7 p.m. I was at the office
today and people were already lined up
for the warehouse sale which starts
tomorrow morning so people get super
super excited about all this stuff
people are asking how long the
livestream is for the livestream is
going to be until
ten-thirty my times it'll be about an
hour and a half so far why don't we take
some time and do some do some Twitter
questions so I'm not sure how well this
is going to work tonight because I'm oh
this is gonna be a problem okay you know
what we're gonna have to do is we're
gonna have to rely on Twitter on this
screen here because because I'm using
two computers to capture as opposed to
how I'm normally using a single computer
to capture and use Twitter so see I I'm
using this laptop for my own view I I
could not figure out a way like you can
use xsplit to capture a portion of the
screen on the computer that you're
actually using but you cannot use xsplit
to capture a portion of the screen or a
portion of a video in stream if you guys
understand what I mean because I'm using
HDMI out on this notebook into a capture
card on the computer over there and then
what I would want to do is take the
Twitter portion here which you guys can
see on the right and then draw a box
around that and make it so that I can
overlay that on top of me sitting here
and talking sort of like this except
that that Twitter feed right there is
actually on the computer over there
between I actually can't read it from
here nor can I control it unless I had a
wireless keyboard in us you know what a
better solution might actually be
instead of using a laptop here just get
a wireless wireless keyboard and mouse
and a monitor and sit here like that so
that I can not and then I'll just clone
the displays and then I'll be able to
monitor things more more closely I think
that'll be a better solution in the
future but we're learning things every
weekend at least we've got the awesome
new camera to use I actually haven't
done any fine-tuning with the lights
today I think I look a little bit washed
out but I've got diesel coming over this
weekend and he's gonna be giving me a
big hand with all of the fact that I
don't know how to use a camera and he'll
be he'll be getting everything all fixed
everything you guys saw shot already so
all of the all of like the new set new
set stuff so let's
go back to the youtubes oh that's what
happens if you spell YouTube wrong all
right then I'm lucky I didn't end up
look like a porn website because I think
that this live stream is supposed to
stay pretty pretty family-friendly so if
you guys haven't already seen any of the
new set footage yes I know it's not
really my style and I know it's like
kind of a little bit too professional
for for a lot of the viewers tastes but
it's something that I do have to do for
a variety of reasons which will become
more clear later and it's something that
yeah wow that just looks kind of that
looks kind of terrible I'm gonna have to
start wearing makeup which is which is
sort of brutal it's something that I do
want to continue to work on but I needed
easels help in order to get the
production values right and in order to
just kind of make it better in general
we didn't have nearly as much time as I
would have liked to spend on that Galaxy
Note 10.1 video but what I'm gonna try
and do is play around with it a little
bit this week I've actually got
something really cool you guys you guys
might even you guys might even really
like this check this up so here's the
power adapter super small power adapter
this is what I'll be playing around with
this weekend this notebook carrying case
is the ultimate accessory for your
notebook you should by now I'm just
kiddin by the way today what I do have
though is a Windows 8 touchscreen
notebook from Samsung this is a series 5
so what that means is that once you boot
it up hopefully the boot up time you
know let's find out how quick the boot
up time is because that's one of the big
things about Windows 8 is dramatically
improved boot up times let's see if we
can like see the camera through the
screen home is it
don't worry wants me to activate Windows
ok go to PC settings and then maybe I'll
just go away from PC settings haha and I
can use it so this is the not natural
interface that's how quickly Windows 8
boots up this is a multi-touch
touchscreen notebook one of the things
I've noticed about it already and I'm a
little bit disappointed in is the
viewing angle so what I find is that
really expensive touchscreen interfaces
like the ones Apple uses like the ones
that Asus uses on their very high-end
products still have phenomenal viewing
angles so you can be looking at it from
like you know here I'll hold up to the
camera you can be looking at it from
like this angle and you'll still be able
to make everything out really well it's
like an IPS panel and the touchscreen
doesn't obscure it but what I've noticed
about this one is whether it's due to
the fact that it's a TN panel or whether
it's due to the touchscreen interface
watch watch what happens with the watch
problems with the viewing angle here as
I tilt it up so you see you actually
don't have to get that low and the image
almost disappears entirely all the color
washes out of it from the top down is is
not nearly as it's not nearly as
noticeable from the sides you lose all
the color but the image tastes there
either way I'm mostly just excited about
the idea of sort of having the option of
using a keyboard and a touch screen at
the same time I did an NCIX tech tips
about this whole sort of touchscreen
keyboard hybrid thing that's going on
and I'm actually not sure if that one's
uploaded yet let's have a quick look
here yeah windows 8 gestures guide and I
also did I also did another one so NCIX
Windows 8 so here I'm showing sort of
how that how the experience is going to
go this one's really old yes this one no
I can't say that I'm entirely sold like
that like I've been playing around with
it a fair bit this one was uploaded on
September 21st so I've been I've been
tinkering with this for over a month and
while I am sold on the idea of
touchscreen with Windows 8 and and
having a keyboard handy what I don't
like and I don't know if you guys can
see my mouse pointer here I'm just gonna
turn the quality down so that so that
doesn't kill the bandwidth here but I
don't know if you guys can see my mouse
pointing here but you see the keyboard
okay so the keyboard has a certain
tournament oh okay let's just find a
shot
okay so the keyboard has a certain
distance from the monitor you never have
unlike with a laptop you never have a
monitor right like right up against your
keyboard no one no one uses a computer
like that I mean here I'll point you at
this one to show you sort of look this
is what I consider to be a more you know
what you're not really even gonna be
able to see that there's a there's a
keyboard there and there's a monitor so
that's what it gives it to be more
normal plus when you're sitting at a
desk and you're you know desktop
experience kind of computer usage model
you typically have some room between the
desk and yourself so what I discovered
playing around with the touchscreen
monitor is that I actually end up far
enough away that it's not really
comfortable so it's very comfortable to
use a device with your arm like they
can't think of the ergonomics of it so
you got your arm kind of been kind of
like this so you got that sort of 100
degree 110 degree angle and that's how
you would typically use a touchscreen
device if you're extending any further
than that to reach the monitor
then you're gonna have a lot more
fatigue I mean it's like leverage right
the further up the weight is away from
your shoulder joint and your elbow the
more pressure there's gonna be on it so
if you're like this it's very
comfortable if you're like this it's
actually quite uncomfortable so with a
notebook experience I think this is a
lot more exciting because here I'm gonna
kind of put this know I can't quite do
that okay I'm gonna put this here
because with the notebook experience
you're sitting this far away from it
which means I can reach it with what I'd
consider to be that optimal arm Bend
without it being uncomfortable so I'm
not I mean yeah no one knows what the
future holds in terms of Windows 8 and
the adoption rate and what its gonna
mean to to to everyone but I can tell
you guys I have already found myself
once in a while sort of reaching towards
the screen of my computer and realizing
it's not a touchscreen because I'm so
used to using a smartphone and a tablet
people are asking for Q&amp;amp;A so I think
it's time to do some Q&amp;amp;A here let's go
ahead and
switch to the Twitter feed which come on
really really kind of not okay Twitter
here we go guys one new tweet really
that can't be right
am I not signed in oh I'm not signed in
well that won't work
- tech and what is my password so that's
it and that is apparently not it which
is sort of bizarre because I changed it
like two minutes ago
because I wasn't able to sign in and I'm
very very sure that that's the correct
password so you guys are going to have
to I'm sorry but you're gonna have to
bear with me here for a second while I
reset my password which is ridiculous
Oh brilliant I was like oh my goodness
this is a total disaster because I
couldn't even switch back to my I can
even switch back to my regular feet here
it really has not been it has not been
my week I've slept very little and it's
been very very challenging I mean yeah
I'm sure you guys have I'm sure you guys
have definitely definitely had weeks
like that before
uh-huh okay now they're gonna send me a
message apparently at least I hope so
because I'd love to do some Q&amp;amp;A right
now that's sort of usually pretty simple
to do now I'm just stalling for time
I have people asking about my shirt
before they think it's an everyday I'm
shufflin shirt but actually it's a
badminton joke and the badminton joke is
everyday I'm shuttling see so it's like
badminton shuttles and then he's holding
a badminton racket so it's slightly
different but it's just a bit of a it's
a bit of a joke based on the the party
rock anthem' song that pretty good if
you're into that sort of thing
hmm
no no it's really really really not
gonna let me in to Twitter right now
which is phenomenally frustrating so
it's asking me to enter my phone number
hold on this is this is not good this is
not good so here this is how it's
supposed to work I'm supposed to type my
username and click Submit and ah there
we go this time it worked awesome
so we'll be live in just a moment with
more Q&amp;amp;A let me see if there's hope
oh oh we're good we're good Tyrion
cereal and we are done
so I am very sure that I'm entering the
password that I think I'm entering this
time and if it manages to not accept
this password again I'm going to be very
very disappointed all right
Kinect time for tweets can you tell us
all what laptop that is and what's
inside it actually I have no idea what
is inside this laptop right now at this
moment I I do know that it's a Samsung
laptop it's a series 5 it comes with
Windows 8 it has ok this is driving me
absolutely crazy the range isn't quite
right on this stupid Bluetooth thing it
has um something yeah it's a serious 5
it has USB 3 I mean it's pretty similar
to the existing series 5 which is the
end something 540 U and then this is the
NT 5 14 which is touched funny story
though is this notebook actually has an
enormous scratch down the back panel you
see that because Samsung has been taking
it around to a wide variety of trade
shows so what I actually had to do in
order to shoot my video showcase of the
notebook and had it not look
phenomenally stupid is I grabbed a uh I
grabbed a 540 U and then I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna pretend that the
back of that notebook is the back of
this notebook and then the front of this
notebook
but is the back of the other one so
that's uh that's my little trick the
kinds of things that go on behind the
scenes right uh here so let's switch
back to the Twitter feed what video card
manufacturer would you say is best for a
novice well whether you're a novice or
an experienced whatever it is that you
are so maybe you mean your novice buyer
novice gamer I don't know doesn't matter
video card manufacturer is just whoever
manufactures your video card so guys
like EVGA seuss msi these are all very
good choices XFX if I had to pick sort
of my top four those would be them it's
very hard to go wrong with any of those
guys at all make the best gaming PC
under six hundred bucks
really guys I get a lot of questions
about what is sort of the best option
for a PC for a given price range and
what I usually end up mean honestly guys
I get literally hundreds of messages
every day and people are often asking
these sort of long complicated questions
I don't have time and it's really not
that hard to find out what's a good
option for a pre-built PC
really really
let's go because you guys as you
probably know I work at NCIX
so you click buy a PC you click gaming
okay you want
$600 you go to value gaming you find a
computer that's $600 that was probably
configured by the crazy Russian so there
you go
core i3 GTX 650 OC working studio three
memory 500 gig hard drive and got some
premium you want to spend a little okay
don't get down there no one sucks but
yeah there you go best i3 30/10 what I
would probably do is I would consider
changing that geforce card over to
something like a seventy seven seventy I
find it to be a little bit of a better
value or spend a little bit more and get
a 650 Ti but yeah I mean when it comes
to choosing a configuration find a
configuration send it to me and I will
happily go through it and make any
suggestions but I can't take questions
like Linus what's the best gaming PC for
1400 I'm great britain pound
we're just kind of like okay well hey I
don't work in that frequency I have no
freakin idea how much things cost and
then B it's like well do a little bit of
a legwork put together something you
think is right send it over to me and
I'll say things like Oh spend more on
the video card maybe drop down the cpu
get a better power supply and that case
is way too expensive for the other
components you're buying dump that back
into getting more performance and then
grab an SSD or something along those
lines I'll give you an idea how to tweak
the machine in order to get the best
value out of it
Sonny asks what do I think about Intel's
Haswell architecture how much of an
important question we expect over Ivy
Bridge right now I can't think anything
about it as well because Haswell is not
out right now so there's not a whole lot
for me to say
I mean it's Intel so my expectation is
pretty solid it's gonna be I believe
this is this a talk or a tick can't
remember but this is an actual
architectural shift whereas Ivy Bridge
was just a process shrink so it's
probably gonna be somewhere in the
neighborhood of 10 to 20 percent
performance improvement and that's
that's sort of that's sort of it it's
pretty much always like that and then
Andy will fall even further behind which
for those of us who who really enjoyed
the Athlon 64 era when AMD basically
revolutionized the whole gig it's sort
of sort of saddening in video 650 TIR
Radeon 7770 I don't game a lot I just
want something better than my xbox
personally I'd probably go 650 ti out of
those two I do I do find the nvidia
experience a little bit better for
certain things if you did want to go
multi-monitor then I go AMD however if
you're gonna go multi-monitor then a 77
70 is the wrong choice anyway because
it's way underpowered for a
multi-monitor setup okay ah Danny says
how are you liking your German car why
did you choose a Volkswagen over another
Honda good question I did not my wife's
car is the Volkswagen Rabbit and my car
is the Honda Civic
the only reason that we've switched
vehicles is because her car is a
two-door and mine's a four-door and
because she's on maternity leave with
the baby she's usually the one driving
in places which means it's a lot more
convenient to load the car seat into the
backseat of a car that is a four-door as
opposed to a two-door it's you're not
allowed to put baby car seats in the
front seat at least here in Canada
anyway due to the regulations and laws
and whatnot so so that's that's why the
that's why we ended up going that route
chill she's gonna want her car back at
some point
shane asked are you going to do an
unboxing of the new AMD piledriver chips
when they come out what do you think of
them i actually have already done more
than an unboxing slicks running a whole
bunch of benchmarks and whatnot and
we've got performance numbers against
the previous generation and e-chips and
that's all gonna go up on the NCIX comm
channel on launch day which is sometime
next week if I recall correctly friends
fresco asks is not a playboy mousepad
which I would answer yes indeed it is
this is a funk pad this is a 1030
archetype this thing is one-of-a-kind as
far as I know because funks whole thing
funk was actually a local vancouver
company their entire manufacturing was
like down the street from NCIX and this
was something that was produced as a
one-off for a former employee of NCIX he
had the he had the misfortune to leave
it in my sight for long enough but I
managed to snag it actually he he he
moved he moved to our Ontario office and
left it behind in his PC office which I
inherited so I totally snagged the the
one-of-a-kind unique playboy mousepad
for myself it's actually an excellent
most pad to that's the difference
between this and like most promotional
mouse pads which are usually crap
because any kind of a graphic on a
mousepad unless it's a really good
surface it's just gonna just destroy the
tracking I mean I love a cool-looking
mousepad there's a great picture on it
as much as the next guy but unless they
do a perfect job of the surface itself
it's going to every time you cross one
of those light to dark
barriers pretty much no matter how good
your mouse is it is going to jump or
skip or pause or something bad something
bad will happen a great example of this
is the the gamepad's that Intel was
giving away with one of their recent
promotions so I'll I'll see if I can
help come on fullscreen I'll see if I
can find these game pads because they're
cool they're really big they're really
big they look that's sort of bizarre but
they're really cool they're huge and
they had this great graphic of like some
guy who's like fantastic but you
couldn't they couldn't attract for crap
and I couldn't even use them
unfortunately but an example of someone
who does do it right would be steel
series so most of their mouse pads that
I've had experience with anyway with
complicated graphics on them such as the
what's that badass dragon Warcraft I
don't know some dragon was on the front
of some most paddock Trek great and like
their Diablo 3 qck also is fantastic so
they do a pretty good job of that as
well let's have a look at some more
tweets shout out to Scottish people okay
you bet family friendly yes I'm family
friendly what do you think this is the
most I'm using right now is not a d600
I'm actually not not quite sure what to
think of the g600 I spend a little bit
of time with it when I first got it
and what I noticed is that it doesn't it
doesn't feel quite as twitchy responsive
as my d9 really like the g9 really like
the iqari laser I really like the Razer
Naga although the economics aren't great
for me but the sensor feels really good
feels really tight really responsive
whereas with the with the g600 I don't
know what it is it's very accurate like
I can decide where I want the pointer to
be I can move in it's there but it just
feels like it took a little bit longer
and no amount of tinkering with the DPI
or installing the drivers are playing
around with it really fixed it for me
it's just a personal preference thing
I'm very picky about mice so so yeah no
I'm not
in the g600 although I was playing
around with it yesterday but I it hasn't
it hasn't managed to make its way on to
my actual punch my actual system desk
although my actual system is in so many
pieces right now but check this up I
actually have pieces of my desktop
machine right here right here for your
for your enjoyment and taunting during
this very livestream see here's their
view of my boot drives and then these
are the rest of my boot drives so if you
guys don't already know I have an 8
drive raid 0 for my for my boot drive on
my desktop machine so that's a total of
just shy of a terabyte of SSD storage I
have them all in raid 0 I know that
seems unwise but I'm doing nightly
backups and I also don't really keep
anything of value on my computer all of
my storage is actually done through
through Windows Home Server so all I do
is I just access over the network
everything that I could possibly need I
have a gigabit network in my home so
it's not like it's any slower than a
mechanical hard drive I mean think about
this for a second guys gigabit is
basically for sort of stupid math 1/10
as around 100 megabytes per second so
what that means is that a hard drive
which is capable of ok sustained maybe a
little higher maybe 160 hundred and 80
megabytes per second and that's an
internal hard drive so on the other end
of that gigabit pipe I have an enormous
raid 6 hooked up to a very fancy RAID
controller card that is actually going
to give better responsiveness than a
single internal hard drive even though
the max bandwidth is a little bit lower
so for me browsing files on my network
storage and I know people seem to kind
of get bored when I when I talk a lot
about network storage and whatnot but
you know what guys it is so awesome I
mean it's totally responsive I can go
into any archive unboxings and I can
just play things over the network just
like this it does not take any longer
than it does if I'm storing the files
locally also it prevents me from running
into situations where I have multi
copies of my files all over my house and
I'm duplicating what I would otherwise
be able to store in all one place so
people are people are bored bored yon
bored lightest go on Twitter not that's
what the twitch chat is saying so you
you you got you guys you guys are
killing me here fine I'll do more
Twitter questions so why would you would
you use an AMD a10 1500 I would use an
i5 35 70 out of all of those options for
a computer that is going to use to fix
photos for eBay that's the only use for
this computer I would use a sempron I
wouldn't I try not to overthink it too
much okay any good mice that are
left-handed or can be used left-handed
that you know of yeah steal serious has
a couple of good ones the sensei is
probably the best option for an
ambidextrous Mouse that has a fantastic
sense or good software and let's move
along to the next Twitter question no I
haven't had a chance to use the Phoenix
necesita mouse haven't used the Razer
Ouroboros either I haven't even heard of
that
have big hands like small mice live on
Vancouver Island so staples is the only
real testing place for mice best smaller
Mouse if I was buying a smaller Mouse
today you know what the g9 is really not
that big so that might be an option for
you if you take a lot of the weight out
of it it has the removable removable
weight cartridges inside so I don't know
if you guys if I use to g9 before but
once you take me out once you take the
outer the outer shell off it actually
comes with a smaller outer shell as well
but then you can actually take out the
weight cartridge and it's really not
that heavy it's super heavy once you put
all the weights on it but that might be
a good option for you other than that if
you play an e mmoes or if you would have
any reason to use the macro keys of
Razer Naga is an excellent Mouse I
really really like it okay
and here's a good question so can you
explain raid I would love to explain
rate for you here's how I'm gonna do it
youtube.com/ let's see let's let's
actually you know what there's no doubt
let's try raid hard drive or something
like that let's try key word that might
work because rates gonna have lots of
other stuff oh I feel okay let's try
raid - really
oh it brings up a bunch of Linux such as
dead for raid - come on you can do it
there we gotta see raid 0 and raid 1 set
up guy preview of a raid build SSDs and
raid I think there's another one that I
did on raid 5 and 6 there there's raid 5
and raid 10 tutorial ok apparently I
didn't cover raid 6 but yes I have
covered explaining raid in pretty good
depth on a number of occasions so you
definitely want to check out those
videos but in summary raid is using
multiple drives together in order to
achieve either better data security or
better speed lata row as tuggin is the
FX 6100 what I have to say about AMD's
product stack is that it is priced
appropriately I saw a really interesting
news article where someone was talking
about how holy crap am these new chips
because there's there's lots of leaks in
terms of pricing and performance on
stuff holy crap and these new chips are
gonna be priced like super low they're
coming in at a very very aggressive
price and although how exciting is this
and my response to that is whenever you
hear anything about pricing for an
upcoming video card or an upcoming CPU
what that should tell you is how well it
performs because aim he's not stupid
Intel's not stupid and videos not stupid
they take their new products and they go
ok so ok this is one of the competitors
product is here at $200 and this is
where the competitors product here is at
a hundred dollars and we know our chip
performs about here so the price of $150
it's not rocket science you can probably
extrapolate the performance of any
upcoming part based on the rumors about
pricing well before it ever comes out so
there you go
how good is an FX 6100 it is exactly hem
FX
6,100 it is exactly $100 good which in
terms of sort of equivalent to what
you'd see on the intel side is sort of
like you know core i3 level and honestly
that's that's probably about where it
falls the exceptions being heavily
threaded workloads for example diesel is
now using an fx-8150 in his rendering
machine and he says it has made a big
difference for him over as existing he
had AK you get either a Q sixty six
hundred or a Q 9550 said it's been like
an awesome like phenomenal upgrade for
him because all those threads is great
for doing things like color correction
post-processing and all the fancy
hoo-hah that he's but he's usually
working on any good ergonomic gaming
keyboards honestly not really the whole
economic keyboard thing is kind of
fallen out of vogue lately
I had a Microsoft natural back in the
day I loved it but there's not really
anything specifically for gaming why a
slips identity such a closely guarded
secret honestly it's not really I mean
people have people have seen him there's
footage of slick on YouTube it says it's
as difficult as going like this slick -
slick revealed bago first hit and well
that's slick with a bag on his head but
this is I think this is slick filming
something at one of the at one of the
live events that we've done so yeah it's
not really that big of a secret it's
just one of those things we're generally
speaking like think about it you go to
see a play do the people who like run
out and move the set around do they do
they have a spotlight on them do they
show their faces not really it's just
how it's done when you're part of the
crew you're supposed to I mean diesel
close it show black you're supposed to
wear black so that you're not going to
get caught in the reflections you're
supposed to stay out of the flexions
you're supposed to be quiet because
otherwise you're gonna you're gonna ruin
the shot and you're not supposed to be
making the show run not necessarily
starring in the show however I think
slick is actually considering using the
the twitch channel here to potentially
use some gameplay streaming videos and
let you guys I'll play some games with
them and stuff so I'll bug them about
that but I think it'll have to be
sometime
after after he's done his exam so slick
still a student just like Etzel they
actually both go to school at the same
place so so yeah once he's done those
exams then we'll be having a different
conversation shoutout from Manila okay
can do yeah no I'm not doing I'm not
doing the ABCs backwards in ASL I
already show what I know how to do it
now I'm a cheap laser on your camera so
you know if it's filming in the right
position instead of checking back on
your monitor that is interesting what
I'm actually checking on the monitor is
whether my switching is working or not
so uh good suggestion love it but but
the the reason I'm doing that is
actually slightly different from from
what's going on because the the wireless
link between this thing is actually not
that good in fusion says we have the
same mouse I love my g9x
I actually have a g9 but you know close
enough you tried really hard that's good
what do you think is better Big Bang X
power or rampage v extreme out of those
two I would probably well Big Bang X
power is an X 58 board for one thing so
I think you mean the Big Bang X power -
I would personally go around page five
extreme for one reason and that's
because it's actually still in a
standard ATX late whereas the Big Bang X
power 2 is as an excel ATX length and
really doesn't fit in a lot of cases I
mean there are cases it fits in but I I
like the Silverstone tjo 7 I like not
being locked to sort of 5% of the cases
that are out there because of the length
of my motherboard I prefer going the
other way around do you think the 650 Ti
is a good bang for the buck yeah it's
good um do you think it'd perform well
as an eg PU electronic GP maybe he means
external GPU with one of those
enclosures not quite sure what he means
by a GPU so I tried I tried how the
time-pressured extreme PC building and
modding contest would slick against
Logan and his team you know what
probably not a bad idea that kind of
thing would be very very fun so I'm not
gonna say that that's not something that
will happen in the future
speaking of things that will happen in
the future I don't know if you guys are
familiar with the PC / podcast or if
you're familiar with PC / in general so
the PC perspective is a website on the
Internet's and they have a podcast and
will actually be making a guest
appearance on that podcast next week so
if you guys want to tune in that's cool
if you don't want to tune it honestly
that's cool too it doesn't really make
that much of a difference to me so
that'll be on the 25th I believe it's
every Thursday I don't even know what
time it is I think it's around noon my
time so so noon my time is whatever time
it is your time get a world clock you
know what there's a widget in Windows so
you just like add that time zone clock
to your to the side of your thing then
you won't have to much too much trouble
with that moving right a lot more and
I've knocked over my keyboard that I use
for switching I'm like a rock star today
this is amazing you use many different
web browsers including opera yes I do
the reason I do that is because I have
many different Google accounts and while
you can now although I don't believe you
used to be able to do it well you can
add additional Google accounts signed in
under the same browser I find it
actually less convenient to use it that
way than to just have five different
browsers that are all logged into five
different Google accounts and just kind
of remember I mean I remember Firefox is
for Linus and NCIX
Internet Explorer is for Instax tek-tips
Chrome is for Linus tech tips Safari is
for Linus cat tips and then opera is
sort of a utility one if I need to log
into one of my other variety of gmail
accounts hmm use 69 50 or new 7870 you
know what I probably go with the new
seventy eight seventy seventy eight
seventy is a great value these days and
it can overclock like like a boss George
says it's the first time tuning in live
thank you for tuning in live George I
appreciate it very very much what would
you recommend for cheap and efficient
power supply
you know what you've probably narrowed
it down to one of the best choices out
there a lot of people ask me for power
supply advice and then totally ignore me
they ask me for power supply advice and
I say get a high efficiency six fifty
five fifty seven fifty watt power supply
and they kind of go home - what do you
think of this 1000 watt 80-plus platinum
and I kind of go well it's a good power
supply but based on the configuration
you showed me
it's gonna suck 250 to 300 watts from
the wall maximum you're actually going
to be getting worse efficiency out of a
higher capacity power supply than you
would out of a lower capacity one it's
not about buying the biggest power
supply it's about buying the most
optimized power supply so if you're
getting a single GPU gaming rig and ei
650 Platinum is actually an excellent
choice way to go Wow
GD your son Getti your son give you your
son I don't know if anyone can pronounce
that you get three points on the
Internet's I'm interested in network
storage
that's fantastic Andre Asst Jorah dusts
best silent fans I get this question a
lot because I'm a bit of a silence door
not to uh F where is it not - there you
go
buy this just buy it and be done with it
this is an amazing fan it is just
amazing in every way it sends the air
where you want it to go it has awesome
static pressure it just it's just
magical if you hate the color scheme
there are other options out there
BitFenix Spectre pros are pretty good
Delon wings are pretty good be quiet
fans I've heard excellent things about
and the one that I checked out was was
excellent as well so there are other
options if you have soul safe gentle
typhoons are awesome as well most of
them you're gonna have to under bolt the
knock to us come with all the adapters
you need to run them super quiet and I'm
just so impressed with not to a every
day all day every day that I just
recommend it any time someone asks me
for the best silent n what's your
thought on dual radiators and a
water-cooled build and what kind of heat
would it require for them to be useful
honestly you can take advantage of a
dual of RAD with just a CPU loop single
rads are not good enough and it's a it's
pretty simple physics to be perfectly
honest because heat dissipation is all
about surface area and I'm sorry I'm
kind of walking away because I'm trying
to figure out if I have a heatsink
anywhere around here but I can show you
guys so heat dissipation
is it surface area and then you have
fans applying moving air to that surface
area to carry the heat away so what that
means is that if you have a radiator
that has less surface area than a heat
sink then it should stand to reason that
the performance of said radiator will
actually be less than a heat sink people
ask me all the time about like Corsair
h-60 age 60 great product mix your
system look tinier
it looks nice it has water in it it
doesn't perform nearly as well as tons
of air coolers on the market because
it's so little surface area oh what it
does do is it removes a fan from your
system although it adds a pump so it's
from a silence perspective I don't even
know if it even makes sense so what so
it's got this tiny tiny surface area
what it does have as an advantage is the
ability to draw heat away from the CPU
more quickly because it's using water
however if you can't dissipate that heat
from the radiator fast enough the water
just warms up and warms up and warms up
until it reaches an equilibrium point
where the water rushing around the loop
is at you know 45 degrees and then even
if it's holding it even even if the CPU
block is efficient enough to take 45
degree water and keep your CPU at 70
degrees then I mean fantastic you've got
a 70 degree CPU that's not better than
air cooling so I really recommend if
you're gonna get a pre done water cooler
get an H 80 get an H 100 a dual rad
makes a huge difference and then a thick
rad makes a big difference as well
however if you really want to go water
cooling the way to do it is to get a
custom custom link custom loop is is
awesome and the way that bosses do it I
hate this thing I have a better wireless
keyboard but I use this one because I
thought you know because it's really a
little profile and be awesome but this
is this is not working tonight going to
test the 7h thanks to you good job
should I buy the fanatic or the normal
one there is no difference Oh
apparently there's a little
that's what the ear cups have no idea
it's the same headphones when I use the
7h if I personally prefer the the
pleather II ear cups as opposed to the
fabric ones so if you're interested in
my thoughts on it at all then I would
probably go that route do you think
anybody will be in video within a glob
Oh glob 8000 series no I it doesn't
matter it's the same old thing every
time everyone wants to speculate I
thought the new am do you think are the
new Nvidia thing or the new Intel thing
how will it perform how would it be
prized you know I it will perform better
it'll be priced the same and then the
prices will erode as the as the the
market gets flooded with parts and then
something new will come out and it will
replace it I'll be that so yeah somewhat
something will happen and someone will
release something and honestly until we
get closer like we haven't even seen any
solid rumors about 8000 series so I'm
not even thinking about it I'm actually
curious to see if AMD even calls it 8000
series I mean I was I was surprised when
Nvidia released a 9800 graphics card
because that was a number that AMD have
used before well ATI I guess at the time
ATI used before with the Radeon 9800 Pro
so it was it was it was quite quite
puzzling to me that they that they
decided to go that route and release on
9800 to go along with father their
competitors 9800 okay not to Lord for
questions
yay thank you - I'm in the market for a
new mechanical gaming keyboard I see you
have the Corsair candy and I want to
know your thoughts I do not use a
corsair cane idea i'm not sure where you
saw me use a corsair cane I'd be
probably on the set of NCIX tech tip so
the cane ID looks fantastic it is like
the best looking keyboard it has
individually backlit keys it's got that
gorgeous aluminum like thing going on
I'm personally not a big fan of cherry
red switches so I'm actually using a me
onyx cycle 60 I've got
couple seven G's and deployment I still
use my G 15 Jen one from time to time
although that's not a mechanical
keyboard I'm more of a cherry cherry
blue cherry well can't use bloom cuz I
have a baby in the house now and it'll
wake out for his cherry blues they're
sold out I'm more of a black black
cherry annex which user although I just
got my hands on the new Logitech
whatever it is I think it's the 7/10
plus this is very exciting
7/10 let's try searching keyboard g7
companies here's the here's the event
tech review so I just thought my hands
on one of these I'm really excited to
try it because they decided to go with
brown switches so brown switches are
basically like they're basically let let
me see if I can remember these I think
brown switches take a little bit more a
little bit more force to depress like
blues but they're quieter than blues if
I recall correctly and then the mushy or
more linear ones are the blacks and the
and the red so a little thing I like
about the blacks I don't like on some
keyboards but I really like on those
idle is not the fact that they're linear
so I'm really excited to try out this
keyboard because I haven't yet seen like
a gaming oriented keyboard with macro
keys and that kind of those kinds of
features with cherry brown switches so
very very very cool very cool let's go
back to Twitter shall we
here's an Intel 330 series SSD ok for a
boot drive yes aim d-pad I review soon
yes I'm in the ok
I read that oh wow we're all the way
back to where we started
fantastic 249 new interactions you guys
are killing me here Wow how do you set
up an Andy main graphics with an Nvidia
PhysX dedicated card had someone asked
this question not that long ago and the
answer I gave them was you can and then
I had someone kind of jump in who
it's lightest you actually can here's a
forum thread somewhere we get yes you
can however you're going to always be
locked into using a last generation
driver and you're every time you want to
update your drivers you're going to be
tweaking something or changing some file
or somehow hacks are ring it and to me
it's really not worth it if you okay
physics is cool I guess there's a couple
games that do leverage it Borderlands 2
being a recent exception of note that
are not exception but a recent notable
title it does utilize physics look if
you want physics using the video
graphics card it really doesn't seem
that complicated
if you don't want to his ex go ahead and
use an AMD graphics card trying to build
in a machine that is basically built
around the idea that the hardware is not
supposed to work together correctly is
asking for trouble you're gonna have
enough trouble with your computer
because computers are finicky sometimes
if you don't intentionally configure a
computer that you know isn't supposed to
work right so that's my two cents on
that and probably won't address it again
but there you go I don't recommend it
razer naga versus course around ninety
personally I'd go Naga the Naga has the
advantage of having more reachable
buttons for me because the buttons are
all so close together but the drawback
of that is because they're so close
together you can often accidentally hit
them however with the m90 I find the I
find the buttons the the left and right
click are a little sensitive for me
they're almost like a hair trigger and I
put more weight on my mouse when I'm
moving it around so I had a little bit
of trouble with that although I got used
to it after a while there's an M 90 on
the machine that's right over there
but then for the side buttons because I
have kind of small hands I found I
wasn't able to really reach that many of
them so Naga Nagano works for me when I
move my hands like an octopus it kills
your your bandwidth that is uh bad as
that is probably the best tweet I've
gotten on a live stream yet so so what
you're saying is I shouldn't do this
oh okay I'm doing it but it's not
counting because I didn't switch
that'd kill anyone else's family I'm
just curious go over to the Guru to the
twitch thing and see what that does
nope okay fine forget it I guess you
should get more bandwidth or something
let's go ahead back to Twitter yes -
should I get a second sic 570 and run
SLI or get a new 670 or 680 usually I
would recommend selling your old card
getting a new car especially because you
can get six 70s for pretty reasonable
prices already the prices like started
really high when they were super
independent and they just kind of run
like this and now they've leveled off a
little bit so now is probably a good
time to buy a 670 I mean a 660ti is a
great option - unless you're running
like super uber multi-monitor in which
case you probably need like - six 70s
and with like lots around 660ti is a
great option once you overclocked them
they get pretty close to a 670 and you
save anywhere from 70 to 100 dollars
depending on where you shop for your six
70s and 660ti s
jewel good question jewel would you use
a knife inity air surrounds up for your
personal right for me no it's not my
preference I like to have a single very
large format display for my personal
machine
however at work I don't know if you've
ever seen something that I've filmed in
my office let me see if I can let me see
if I can actually find something that
I've shown you my office so - giveaway I
can catch filmed a couple in my office
oh yeah there's that one that's that's
not my office um well if you've seen my
office you'll know that I actually have
four monitors four monitors on my desk
in my office because I find for
productivity this is awesome
these these are so good the submissions
for the a for the Duke Nukem giveaway
contest now I'll now I'm all reminiscing
and stuff because this is awesome this
was a really good one my favorite though
can find my favorite one totally just
play this for you guys you know you
won't have audio anyway so I guess it
doesn't really matter but for work
multi-monitor awesome prefer it for
gaming i prefer a single monitor because
I find the peripheral experience doesn't
really have that much for me personally
got a good liquid cooler suggestion um
get the age 100 there you go
sorry should go back to Twitter how are
high end USB Dax compared to internal
cards often actually better if you can
find a super awesome USB DAC then you
will get the advantage of having it
completely removed from all the
interference that's bouncing around
inside of a computer chassis and you
will also have the advantage of well I
mean come on that sound doesn't need any
huge data rate USB 2 is a-ok
so you've got removed you can also have
the added space of having a larger
enclosure so something like an asus
essence one would be an example of a
product that would leverage both the the
lack of interference oh my goodness its
lines video section the lack of
interference and the extra space so
essence one and it sounds so good i
actually did a video about this thing at
one point it only does it does
headphones or 2.1 speakers that's it but
it does do up sampling and it just
sounds amazing
so my new my new audio setup is gonna be
once I finally get my personal rig back
up and running is gonna be a yes this
one for my headphones the courser SP
2500 is running off my zone are sent so
my my sound card and then I'm gonna have
the Thunder effects that got included
with the Maximus 5 formula for my
microphone in because it has an awesome
like ambient noise canceling thing so if
the baby's crying it's got a microphone
on the front that hears that the baby's
crying and then that's not my voice
because it also has a microphone jack
and it'll just cancel it out is really
freaking cool so that's that's gonna be
my new setup just change
what there you go
awesome watch all videos and reviews I
could find still can't decide on a good
heads at the compliment done RDX d2x
I get a 7h Ben can you shine some light
on microfiber nestled on ways to prevent
it there's nothing you can do to prevent
it and personally I don't really see it
so I can't comment on it too much some
people really see it some people really
don't are you still considering to
launch a Europe store or shipping gear I
feel left out if I'm not being able to
buy what I said was you never know what
the future holds I didn't say that
that's that's happening so yeah let's
not let's not read too much into things
all right
first time watching from John Salas
Barry what do you think about gigabyte
GPUs they seem noticeably absent from
every GPU review of yours um dad they're
good nothing wrong with them
it's just that whatever whatever I get
sent oftentimes is what I'll take a look
at and for me I I guess it comes down to
personal philosophy because for me thank
you for me I find stuff like this
youtube.com/ kind of pointless and I
mean I love Paul but I'm sure that he
had to do this where they've got like
look at this one reference card
ah-ooh reference cards
ah 3er reference cards uh for reference
oh man I mean it's tedious here another
reference card uh uh uh what is that
five v reference GTX 680 s I mean that's
cool and all but do you are they really
different do you really care if I take
the MSI one and I go
here's the honest I won it's pretty
ballin here's the galaxy one it's all
it's got a different color sticker I
don't think you guys want to see that I
think that if you subscribe to this
channel for the point of seeing a
different video every day I would be
doing a disservice if I uploaded the
same video card five times in a row with
a slightly different package and a
slightly different sticker now when we
come into video cards that are unique
then we've got a different thing going
on so for example the 7970 matrix
because it is so cool and so unique
justified it's only full performance
review and close look on the emcee I
expect its charm remember guys if you
are only subscribed to me on - tech tips
then you are going to miss out on a lot
of the deeper content that I'm doing for
the NCIX channel as well remember I work
there so I'm the video spokesman there
as well as maintaining - tech tips is
more of like a Bloggie style thing so
this is apparently gonna run in 1080p
which is probably a little bit much for
what we're doing this was also one of
the first videos where diesel started
doing some of these really cool things
with the with the new camera so I forget
oh she died forget what he calls it but
it's called like a like a
something-something gain or something
where you can see the a soos one is
blurry and then it switches to being
clear because it's changing the changing
the focus and then the assist is clear
and the 7970 is blurry just looks super
cool but but yeah so so when it comes
down to is if there's something unique
and different about it then sure yeah I
don't mind taking a look at more than
one card but when we're talking a soos
direct see you and the side foo frozer
and gigabyte windforce
we're talking duel fans some heat pipes
some aluminum fins you want to see that
five times I mean okay hey if you want
to see that five times let me know and I
can totally totally change my policy and
I can start doing it differently but if
you don't want to see that five times
then that's good - I have never watched
Breaking Bad
- someone who asked if I'm a fan of the
show so I've heard is great but it's
like I have
so little time these days that I haven't
I haven't managed to watch TV in in a
very long time
I hardly find time to watch my weekly
zero punctuation so and that's like five
minutes long what type of case should I
get for under 170 full ATX I define
Excel is probably not a bad choice
I really like the define Excel but I
hate it when people ask me what case to
get without giving me any context you
want quiet you want sort of a more
aggressive gamer look you know half XM
would be a good choice in that case I
can't make this choice for you unless
you give me some idea what bank you're
going for I'll be doing another giveaway
at some point maybe soon maybe I'm
filming something this weekend no
promises or anything up when your son
gets older and all his friends are
getting consoles will you build him an
amazing rig and make them cry before all
his friends are getting consoles he'll
already have an amazing ring and I'll
encourage him to take his amazing rig
over to his friends houses and it'll be
like so massive and heavy that he can
just drop it on their consoles and
literally crush them because the PC has
a gaming platform literally crushes
console so yes he will he will fully
understand the value of the PC as a
gaming platform versus consoles because
consoles are for console people which is
pretty much all you need to know about
them no I'm just kidding you guys can
play games on consoles you're cool too
Luke asks each 108 HP 14 and a 600 team
I've got the H 100 personally can I have
your bridge number wait for hazlo I'm
impossible to say so many people again
ask me these questions I don't know
because I don't know how Haswell
performs I don't know how much it costs
so you guys are asking me to solve for
to solve for okay so it huh maybe
there's a great example of algebra so X
let's say X is yes and Y is no or
something so solve for this yes or no
variable and then you've got like the
current thing and then you've got the
future thing which is also a variable so
actually I can't solve for this variable
without knowing this variable so those
of you who learned like well and at
least completed a high school level math
course will know what I'm talking about
- what's the input leg like with PC
pb2 Sumeet kilig very good actually for
2560 by 1440 monitor outstanding colors
excellent a little bit of motion blur
not bad though really liked it great
monitor kudos flying us I'm going back
to sleep okay good night
I guess he's probably gone by now since
that was seven minutes ago would a nine
three thirty to twenty last me until
Intel skylake wow this is taking it even
further
check out this tweet guys so I was I was
just talking about how I can't speculate
on the next platform that's coming and
I'm being asked about something that's
not even due to be released for three
years come on Jason will it last you I
don't know it's impossible to say what
how multi-threading aware games are
gonna become without knowing what the
heck you're doing with your computer
like are you gonna be rendering 4k
videos in that case your i3 3220 is
gonna get squished like a bug sorry man
I I mean if you've been using any 7,400
until now and that's worked for you then
what I know about your usage model is
that you don't upgrade that often so
based on that I'd say that you're
getting a pretty equivalent processor
today so maybe could that last you
another three years probably that's the
only way I can answer that question
though is an overclocked 670 better than
a stock 680 yes but you could also
overclock a 680 so there you go any
experience with any of the cyber gaming
mice - keyboards I play around with a
rat something or other which is so yeah
it's Seibert no I think they changed
their branding not that long ago so it's
very confusing but yeah it's okay Falcon
sensor felt good I didn't really like
the modularity of the most because I
couldn't personally find mice that are
comfortable for me already and I found
it just kind of it's kind of weird but
but lots of people lots of people like
them I'm not meowing on the live stream
thanks to Eduardo for his uh for a
suggestion there oh sorry I'm not on the
Twitter thing please me out no thank you
ah I just bought SP twenty five hundreds
is is supposed to hiss when it's turned
on and nothing's playing there may be a
slight hiss
but if it's loud then that might be
something where you want to look into
our angles of course there 9 times out
of 10 it's something to do with the amp
so for example my old monsoon oven 2000s
had quite a history and I ended up it
ended up being caused by the amp so
there's really nothing you can do about
it with these with these kit speakers
because you can't just replace the the
amp what graphics card would be good for
a 19 to 21 inch monitor this is
something I've wanted to talk about on
the live stream for a while the size of
your monitor has nothing to do with how
much graphics card horsepower it
requires I'm gonna let that sink in for
a second the only thing that matters is
how many pixels so for example a lot of
people were really confused back when I
released this video the the GeForce GTX
590 triple projector ultimate panoramic
gaming experience episode and that's me
at my best of course yeah because they
were like holy crap how does a graphics
card power you know a 200 inch display
to which I responded well these are
three 720p monitors so if you actually
do the math it's not that much more
intensive than powering a single 1080p
monitor off a GTX 590 which definitely
has the horses for it so don't don't
worry about that so yeah guys only
pixels it doesn't matter if you're
running a 1080p 23 inch monitor or if
you're running at 1080p 70 inch TV it
requires exactly the same amount of
graphics power in order to achieve the
results that you are looking for so I
would need to know what resolution your
monitor is however based on what I know
about 19 and 21 inch monitors anything
higher than a dgx-650 TI you're probably
not gonna see as much benefit of
something like a 660ti would be the
maximum I would spend for a resolution
like that and you'd be able to crank up
absolutely everything
excuse me what is the absolute smallest
case that can fit a 2 by 100 radiator
you know what that's a great question
and because I don't know off the top of
my head I would love for I would love
for anyone else who's on Twitter to
reply to Matthew last here and let him
know if there's any super small cases
that you've seen are confirmed to fit a
course or age 100 good question
Jacob asks would I ever use an AMD
graphics card
well I'd use it for lots of things my
wife's computer has a 58 70 in it I have
used 8 AMD graphics cards in the past my
first my first when I mean I'll call it
high-end but it wasn't really high-end
it was a couple hundred bucks few
hundred bucks
my first high-end graphics card but I
bought beyond using like on board or
cheapo entry-level stuff was an
all-in-one derp 9600 pro so that was
that was kind of back in the day now but
that was a fantastic card loved it from
there I upgraded to an X 800 Pro from
there I went to an X 800 XT I used a 38
70 HD 3870 at one point because that was
a cool card you could take off the
air-cooled shrouded thing that was only
connected to the GPU and it actually had
a built-in unison so all you had to do
was for a GPU waterblock on it and you
were ready to go that was a very cool
card I have a 2900 XT and my work
machines
I don't think there's anything newer
than that that I have used not since
then yeah not since then my biggest
problem with reference AMD cards is they
tend to exhibit more coil line than
their Nvidia counterparts and again
because I'm a silence freak it almost
has nothing to do with performance for
me I will take a card that performs 30%
slower and is silent versus one that is
like bleeding-edge fast and goes
you know whenever it's loading games and
textures and stuff like that I find that
just super super obnoxious nice gaming
laptop can you tell us if the fatality
soundcard is better than the phoebus
absolutely not a soos is the king when
it comes to sound cards these days the
Phoebus is way better than the fatality
sound card which is like a five-year-old
design at this point is it possible to
buy just the hydro copper water block
for the 680 I don't believe so EVGA only
sells them with video cards however you
could get a different water block that
would probably be better than the hydro
comfort anyway and put that on your 680
good point Andrew I have not used the
Coolermaster CM storm trigger but I'm
very excited about the brown brown
switches - would you recommend
mechanical keyboards it doesn't even
matter for FPS gaming put in four blank
yes I would recommend mechanical
keyboards they are way better than
anything else you know I actually spent
a fair bit of time with the Mamba back
when it was released good question what
do I think of the Razer Mamba it is very
responsive so in terms of the input
latency it is outstanding didn't really
like the ergonomics that much which to
me is sort of a killer but let me see if
I can actually that was one of my
favorite videos that I ever did was in a
Razer Mambo one let's see Oh chill oh
wow really
six hundred and eighty thousand views on
a Mamba video
wow that's outstanding
well let's see if I can let's see if I
can find mine there we go
Eric's calm razer mamba from april 16th
2009
so our video quality wasn't wasn't what
it wasn't what it is now this is awesome
though I actually sing the Mamba song
mom Mamba
number 5 and this is business camera
man's coming in here see so I made up my
own sort of lyrics to to Mambo number 5
and chemically I'll let you guys sort of
you know sing along in your heads
if you watch that if you watch that
video you can enjoy via you can join my
my terrible singing and I basically said
everything I think about the Mamba in
that video I didn't end up using it so I
guess that should be all you need to
know at a certain level sorry not much
time with the Sidewinder x4 so I can't
really comment yes you can have a shout
out to the Danish viewers hi Danish
viewers thank you for watching this live
stream and I hope you are enjoying it
actually I want to check my my live
stream ideas things ahh
shout out to Mexico viewers I did
promise that and then I also wanted to
talk about single versus multi real
power supplies so tell you what since
you twitch people are all whining and
griping every time I try and talk about
something other than Q&amp;amp;A would you guys
like to hear about single rail versus
multi rail or would you like to complain
somewhere ok I'm this thing this is no
no yes no no yes yes yes you guys can
make up your mind so I'm just gonna do
it because I think it's a good idea
single rail versus multi rail power
supplies so basically most modern power
supplies and I okay maybe I shouldn't
say most but many modern power supplies
actually are taking a virtual approach
to a multi rail design so while all of
the power is being generated with a
single 12 volt rail it is using
electronic technology to separate them
out and then implement safety mechanisms
on a per rail basis on virtual rails
that's why you even see power supplies
that have switches between single rail
and multi Renault so this means a couple
of things so number one is that it means
that your multi rail power supply is can
be a little okay let's step way back
multi-room why does it exist multi rail
came around originally back in the p4
days when it came to be that we were
drawing dramatically more power from the
12 volt rail all of a sudden so power
supply manufacturers were kind of like
oh well this is a lot of amperage to put
on one rail and the ATX specific a
changed to actually require multi rail
power supplies for a TXV whatever one
point whatever specification compliancy
for a while so then what happened after
that was stuff continued to draw more
and more power from the 12 volt rail and
so video cards and CPUs particularly I
mean Backlund Intel Pentium D series
those things were power hogs you
wouldn't believe a motherboard that I
saw once that had the entire vrm like it
was one of those Asus cardboard color
boards you know those older orange e
yellow ones the entire back of the board
was like brown brown where the MOSFETs
work in spite of the cooling fan that
was blowing air down on them because
those things drew so much power they ran
so hot so so what happened was we split
it out into multi rails so that when we
when safety mechanisms were applied to
the individual rails it wouldn't be so
much power that it would just explode
okay in layman's terms then what
happened we started drawing more power
from the 12 volt rail and we started
running into issues where if the
manufacturer didn't implement multi rail
correctly if you plugged in your CPU and
then your GPU accidentally because it
was all molex powered back then so your
CPU and all your hard drives you had
them all running off the same rail in
the power supply even though you had a
450 watt power supply and your system
will need root three hundred Watts from
it you could run into situations where
your system would just power down as
soon as you got under gaming load and
that caused a big problem for gamers and
we started to see single rail power
supplies come back to prevalence I mean
guys like PC power and cooling have sort
of always been all about single rail
corsair has stayed predominantly single
rails for their very high end stuff XFX
is single rail on their high-end stuff
especially now however that issues
pretty much gone I mean even even power
supplies like antics high currents
Quattro wasn't your high current pro
hiker Quattro was a multi rail design
but I was still because they've added
more sort of overflow onto each
individual but also one rail so just
because you've got like let's say a
hundred ounce total and then you got
rales you don't go ten tenten tenten
tenten tenten tenten it doesn't work
that way you can go each of these rails
can handle 22 amps maximum but obviously
you couldn't load them all at point
amounts because that would exceed the
maximum total current capability of the
power supply so that means that you can
sort of Bora
power from one rail to another with the
modern implementations of Multi rail
designs in order to whether they're
virtual or whether they're real in order
to maintain that safety where you're not
running so much power through one wire
to the point where you can actually like
melt connectors it's happened but you're
able to borrow that power so I was able
to run a dual cooling
Boreas liquid cooling tech units off of
one of those power supplies in spite of
its multi rail configuration and that's
a couple of year old unit now so single
rail Multi rail which is the right
choice personally I don't think about it
too much I've added a power supply that
I like in terms of you know cable
management in terms of the cooling in
terms of how quiet it is the XFX one I'm
using now and some of the sea Sonic ones
actually have a hybrid fan control so if
the loads under 50% it doesn't turn the
fan on at all yay perfect for silence
freaks that's basically like buying a
500 watt passive power supply awesome
fan only turns on when you're gaming
perfect so it happens to be a single
rail does it matter to me not really you
haven't heard too many stories of
people's computers blowing up due to
single rail power supplies but companies
like an tech that tend to do things very
like buys ebook will probably continue
to implement multi rail and that's fine
too
so there I hope that wasn't too boring
for you guys and that you haven't all
like tuned oh because I'm talking about
power supplies so let's go ahead and go
back to Twitter and see if we can get
this to switch there we go
graphics difference between VGA DVI and
HDMI VGA sucks DB is higher bandwidth
than HDMI and HDMI is lower bandwidth in
DVI which is only matters if you're
running a higher resolution I then I'm
on broadband 250 but they haven't
managed to fix my upload yet so I'm only
on 5 megabit up so I'm actually calling
shot tomorrow to complain about
and get the the difference in price
addressed by them OS how do you feel
about OCC's stop dropping 70% in the
past week or so I actually know a lot of
people at OCC they're they're like
they're my bros but I gotta say it's
looking ugly right now for you know all
the people that are leaving I mean and I
I know a couple guys who are you're gone
the way that their stock has gone like
this well no it's blowing more like this
and then like this you know like great
products vertex for particularly is just
awesome I mean it was the first time
they really released something that was
truly their own not I mean Revo Drive is
kind of their own but it's like their
own implementation of like someone
else's RAID controller and someone
else's controller with someone else's
firmware whereas vertex for at least
have their own firmware on a Marvel
controller so I don't know I I hope they
pull out of this maybe they'll get
acquired maybe they'll maybe they'll
figure it out but if you're asking me if
I'm invested ocz today the answer is
probably probably not would you
recommend any hardware for Avicii
recording live music you know what I'm
not the expert on that
unfortunately what do I think about
Windows 8 I'm excited for the snappiness
the quick boot times and all that good
stuff but I'm I'm less excited for how
unexcited other people are not a
question but please do a follow-up of
some of the stuff you take a first look
at some products are interesting to see
me test right up till now the problem
has been that I'm very time constrained
so I do have a full-time job at NCIX for
those of you who think that I make like
a billion dollars on YouTube and that's
sort of how I make my living it's really
not how it works for me I do have a real
job then YouTube is like is like it's
great and it's fun and it is part of my
job but it is not something that I can
afford to spend more than maybe a day a
day and a half a week
I mean honestly even doing things like
live streams if you guys sort of noticed
what time it is it's Friday night at
10:30 do you think I'm on the clock for
work the answer would be no
so I mean I do this because I enjoyed it
because it's fun because I mean you guys
have supported me so much but I just
don't have the time so if in the future
that changes yes I would be happy to do
more in-depth looks of things but for
now I'm gonna have to pretty much stick
with the way it is if you want to see
the more in-depth looks that I do do
make sure you're subscribed to the NCI
XCOM channel I haven't used those
ZeniMax fans can you slip to a eyefinity
I really don't understand you saying
that's not what I Finity is Eyefinity is
three monitors or more and then two-way
so that's a gtx 560 doesn't support
Eyefinity okay if you're asking if you
can run two monitors off of a gtx 560
the answer is yes so there you go what's
the best power supply just grab like an
HX 750 or something it's a great choice
for a configuration like that William
says my question will be answered cool
what you think is the best case under 80
bucks Corsair has one coming the 200 are
that I think is very exciting I'm
actually I haven't unboxed it yet I
haven't seen it in person yet but I
think that might be a great choice for
around 80 bucks how much radiator
surface area and a custom water cooling
loop do you would you need for a CPU GPU
configuration great great questions
Sawyer
generally speaking the rule that I
follow is one 120 millimeter radiator
per heat source at least and then double
that if you want a silent system so if
you have a CPU and a GPU you're gonna
want at least a dual rat if you want to
run super low rpm fans and have like a
silent system you're gonna want at least
a quad that's my general one says shadow
to swim birthday shout-out to one happy
birthday and all that good stuff 6:00
a.m. and watching - you are the man
whose deeds fused ISM that's awesome
love it well in 8150 bottleneck dual 79
70s Oh Lawrence the 8150 will perform
oftentimes like
70% with a frame rate of a 35 7ek I mean
I get a lot of flack from viewers from
time to time for being an Intel fanboy
but the reality of it is the way that I
evaluate hardware is this is the product
and this is what it does and this is the
other product and this is what it does
and if this product is less than this
one does then it's not as good it's not
fanboy ism it's not it's just reality
it's like reality check
8150 is not a high-end CPU it costs see
this comes back to something I was
talking about earlier why do things cost
what they do the 8150 they can rent it
FX all they want but the 8150 is one
$79.99 on sale because it is worth one
hundred and seventy nine ninety-nine on
sale in spite of the fact that it is an
eight core processor and it is an
absolute beast when it comes to video
editing and that's that's all there is
to really say - some onion emails
basically made me for FPS games any
advice on I don't SteelSeries sensei the
onyx mics are pretty good really like my
onyx mice on my laptop what's better a
hard drive password or a bios password
or both use the encryption on your hard
drive the bios password does almost
nothing so bios password is only
relevant if you want people to not go
into your bios and change your dealer
whoops change your boot order for
example which i think is a non-factor
for most people
all right last Twitter question of the
night and just before we do that I want
to thank all 1,700 of you for tuning in
this is fantastic you guys make me feel
very very loved and and that that is
absolutely thrilling you guys are just
awesome and let's go ahead and go back
to Twitter so I'm gonna kind of roll the
dice and oh people want to see the cat
okay you know what I will see what I can
do I'll see what I can do about
summoning a cat Rumble Rumble
come here sweetheart Rumble he usually
comes when I call if he's not sleeping
you're trapped somewhere rumble and I
usually use snapping when I'm pointing
it like a bug or something I want them
to kill so they often come when I snap
my fingers as well rumble
I hear me ollie
you know you might be trapped in a room
okay okay I'm gonna bring rumble for a
guest appearance
sorry guys I forgot a little actually
really not feeling well so I shouldn't
have been calling him anyway but I
brought rocket to visit rockets they
hide in the camera Rockets really more
camera-shy than his brother say hi I
think this is this is my this is my boy
so for those of you who aren't familiar
with my cats they are bangles which is
sort of a cool breed that involves this
kind of a leopard print sort of thing
that they got going on here so hopefully
this is HD enough that you guys can can
see him so he's uh he is not a marbled
Bengal he is a spotted bangle you can
get done in a variety of different sort
of configurations Marvel is just like a
different coat pattern and then you can
get this is a golden color then you can
also get them in silver which is
significantly more rare and and very
very expensive I think for a breeding
female silver bangle the breeder is
saying something along the lines of 15
grand to 25 grand depending on the
quality of the cat in terms of their
coat and whatever else these are pet
quality cats so they have imperfections
that make them not conform to the breed
standard or whatever else but there
I brought my cat to visit hopefully you
guys enjoyed that and yes and I will
come on that's which people are give me
over time not talking about my cat like
it's an item I mean my cat but Bengal
breed is an item so let's put it that
way it's my dad's birthday remind you to
congratulate him hi this is just like
the weirdest tweet every I don't think I
don't think that's gonna work
alright so let's find one more one more
to answer you know what let's go with
this one mark what do you think about
sharing your idol computer time to
dedicate your CPU scientific research
via the Internet
so he's referring to projects like
folding at home sette point my comment
on that
spin that as long as it's as long as
it's not disruptive to my computer using
experience and what I found last time I
tried to really get into folding was
that it was making it so my games were
crashing all the time I haven't tried in
a while but other than that it's great
the drawback is that you do usually see
a significant increase in your power
usage so if you can afford the extra a
little bit of money or if that's
something that you want to contribute
you know folding at home has been doing
actually a lot of really cool research
Boing I'm less familiar with what
they're doing I think said he is looking
for extraterrestrial life or something
along those lines but yeah great idea
but your room and your computer will run
hotter your power bill will be more so
as long as you factor those things into
whatever decision you make then you
should be good to go thank you guys for
checking out the livestream tonight and
again thank you for all of your support
and good night from Canada or good
morning or whatever that you guys are
I'm gonna go ahead and turn my camera
off now Hey fear dose Jafar asks here's
the m4 better than the vertex 3 you know
what they're pretty going close so it
doesn't really make much difference to
me one way or the other can you
recommend a good stuff $400 or $350 2072
no I guess it expensive yeah yeah sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
