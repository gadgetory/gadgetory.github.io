trusted graphics partner Nvidia welcome
to another Linus tech tips video this
video was intended to be part of our
GeForce GTX Titan coverage so here's our
Titan GPU on our test bench or well one
of our test benches more on that in a
moment this is the fastest single GPU
graphics card in the world and it was
intended to be kind of like what's the
best the best platform pairing for the
Titan GPU but we went a little bit
beyond that and took it to be more of a
a cross section of games from our test
platform our test suite where we went
okay well let's actually just look at a
bunch of different platforms so we took
our X 79 platform here so this is with a
39 60 xf 4 gigahertz which is probably a
little bit conservative for that one and
then we ran that with 16 gigs of ram so
4 dims running in quad-channel then we
took our FX our 99th EFX platform with
an 83 50 on 4.6 gigahertz this one runs
with just 8 gigs so these are running so
everything's running with all channels
populated with one dim ok so this one's
running with 8 gigs and dual channel
then we grab a 3770k with 8 gigs of
memory ok and that one's clocked at 4.4
gigahertz we're going for overclocks
here remember all of our stuffs
overclock the titans overclocked
everything's overclocked we're going for
over clocks that we believe are gonna be
attainable for 95 to 98% of the people
who own this hardware so you guys have a
realistic idea of what you can expect so
this one's at 4.4 gigahertz then we
grabbed an older platform just to
represent anyone running a bloomfield
or Linfield cpu so this is an 8 75 K and
we ran that one with 8 gigs of ram at
what was it 3.8 or something like that I
don't remember what we ran it at but
it's on our graph so don't worry too
much about it so we took four different
platforms and ran our entire game test
suite with the Titan now we are planning
to rerun a slightly different test 3570
K versus 8350 and just those two CPUs
with a more realistic GPU like a 660ti
and then but that'll be a separate video
so this is more
like we were doing this work anyway for
the Titan launch so we figured let's
take a bunch of platforms let's see
which one games the best this is running
1080p for all the different games and
here is our first game so actually we
don't have to stare at the screen
because we can overlay these graphs but
the 3960 x takes the top of the charts
in Crysis 3 and this makes sense now
what we've heard is that the 8350
actually beats 435 70 K but we haven't
tested that yet because Crysis 3 seems
to really benefit from multi-course and
we do see that in spite of the fact that
the 39 60 X has lower instructions per
clock than a 3770k in spite of the fact
that it's actually clocked 10 percent
lower it performs equally and we can
only attribute that to the fact that it
has two more physical course and two
more virtual course the 875 K also
performs quite well in this game keeping
up with the 80 350 and we can attribute
that to the fact that it has
hyper-threading so the 3770k beats out
the 83 50 but that might only be because
of hyper threading and I'm really
excited to check out the 35 70 which is
quad-core no hyper threading against
AMD's 8 core FX flagship moving along to
Far Cry 3 Far Cry 3 seems to really
benefit from single-threaded performance
so the 3770k at 4.4 gigahertz cleans up
here beating out the 39 60 X the 80 350
and the significantly older now 875 K
which is starting to really show its age
in terms of gaming performance in this
particular game now our skyrim is
running with 18 different mods from the
Steam Workshop so it's not really a
stock Skyrim so you're gonna see more
separation than you would if you're
running at stock this one seems to
benefit from mostly just having well
high clock speeds and doesn't get much
of a benefit at all from the 8 cores of
the 8350 which you can see performs
about the same as a much older quad core
875 K so this one is not optimized for
multiple courts you need higher
instructions per clock and that's what
we get on the 3770k and 39 60 X
battlefield 3 at the ultra presets now
battlefield 3 is regarded as one of
those games that does benefit from
multi-threading but it doesn't seem to
favor the AMD platform so all of our
hyper threading enabled processors as
well
our faster hyper-threading enabled
processors so our 3770k in our 3960 axe
performs significantly better in
battlefield 3 then the 8350 however it
should be noted that the scale on this
graph is a little bit funny so I'll have
to let slick know before he makes graphs
like this next time that this should
start at zero so the difference in
performance between these processors
isn't actually as dramatic as it looks
it's okay he says he fixed it before but
apparently oh oh he'll fix it before we
you can download all these graphs from
the link in the video description and
he'll fix it before uploading it so you
guys will see the correct version in the
in the download there Metro 2033 the
3960 X this is kind of bizarre it just
tanks in this one and we're not really
sure why that happened but this game
didn't like this platform that much the
3770k cleans up the 8350 shows it shows
it strength so Metro 33 does seem to
benefit from the additional cores but
then it doesn't benefit from the
additional core so it might just be an
AMD architectural thing that this game
likes but yeah pretty much all of you
say about that and then witcher 2 has
everything performing actually pretty
closely so AMD brings up the rear but
even that's only about 10% slower than
the flagship 3960 x from Intel and the
3770k which is the fastest Ivy Bridge
processor right now and that's pretty
much the end of the slideshow so
hopefully this has been somewhat
enlightening and you guys can sort of
see why we actually sort of ran it
hopefully it was interesting thanks for
