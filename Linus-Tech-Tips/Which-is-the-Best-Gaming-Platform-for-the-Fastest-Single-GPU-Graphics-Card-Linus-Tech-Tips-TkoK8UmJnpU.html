trusted graphics partner Nvidia welcome
to another Linus tech tips video this
video was intended to be part of our
geforce gtx titan coverage so here's our
Titan GPU on our test bench or well one
of our test benches more on that in a
moment this is the fastest single GPU
graphics card in the world and it was
intended to be kind of like what's the
best the best platform pairing for the
Titan GPU but we went a little bit
beyond that and took it to be more of a
a cross section of games from our test
platform our test suite where we went ok
well let's actually just look at a bunch
of different platforms so we took our
x79 platform here so this is with a 30
960 x f4 gigahertz which is probably a
little bit conservative for that one and
then we ran that with 16 gigs of ram so
for dims running in quad channel then we
took our FX are up 990fx platform with
an 8350 at 4.6 gigahertz this one runs
with just eight gigs so these are
running so everything's running with all
channels populated with one dim ok so
this one's running with eight gigs and
dual channel then we grab a 3770k with
eight gigs of memory ok and that one's
clocked at 4.4 gigahertz we're going for
overclocks here remember all of our
stuffs overclock the Titans overclocked
everything's overclocked we're going for
overclocks that we believe are going to
be attainable for 95 to ninety-eight
percent of the people who own this
hardware so you guys have a realistic
idea of what you can expect so this
one's at 4.4 gigahertz then we grabbed
an older platform just to represent
anyone running a Bloomfield or Linfield
CPU so this is an 875 k and we ran that
one with eight gigs of RAM at what was
it 3.8 or something like that I'll
remember what we ran it at but it's on
our grass so don't worry too much about
it so we took four different platforms
and ran our entire game test suite with
the Titan now we are planning to rerun a
slightly different test 3570k versus
8350 and just those two cpus with a more
realistic GPU like a 660 ti and then but
that'll be a separate video so this is
more
we were doing this work anyway for the
Titan launch so we figured let's take a
bunch of platforms let's see which one
games the best this is running 1080p for
all the different games and here is our
first game so actually we don't have to
stare at the screen because we can
overlay these graphs but the 30 960 X
takes the top of the charts in Crysis 3
and this makes sense now what we've
heard is that the 8350 actually beats
the 3570k but we haven't tested that yet
because crysis 3 seems to really benefit
from multi-course and we do see that in
spite of the fact that the 30 960 x has
lower instructions per clock than a
3770k in spite of the fact that it's
actually clocked ten percent lower it
performs equally and we can only
attribute that to the fact that it has
two more physical course and two more
virtual cores the 875 k also performs
quite well in this game keeping up with
the 8350 and we can attribute that to
the fact that it has hyperthreading so
the 3770k beats out the 8350 but that
might only be because of hyper threading
and I'm really excited to check out the
35 70 which is quad-core no
hyper-threading against AMD's eight core
FX flagship moving along too far cry 3
far cry 3 seems to really benefit from
single threaded performance so the 3770k
at 4.4 gigahertz cleans up here beating
out the 39 60 X the 8350 and the
significantly older now 875 k which is
starting to really show its age in terms
of gaming performance in this particular
game now our Skyrim is running with 18
different mods from the Steam Workshop
so it's not really a stock Skyrim so
you're going to see more separation than
you would if you're running at stock
this one seems to benefit from mostly
just having well hi clock speeds and
doesn't get much of a benefit at all
from the eight cores of the 8350 which
you can see performs about the same as a
much older quad-core 875 k so this one
is not optimized for multiple cores you
need higher instructions per clock and
that's what we get on the 3770k and 39
60 X battlefield 3 at the ultra presets
now battlefield 3 is regarded as one of
those games that does benefit from
multi-threading but it doesn't seem to
favor the AMD platform so all of our
hyper-threading enabled processors as
well
are faster hyper-threading enabled
processors so our 3770k in our 3960 acts
performed significantly better in
battlefield 3 then the 8350 however it
should be noted that the scale on this
graph is a little bit funny so i'll have
to let slick know before he makes graphs
like this next time that this should
start at zero so the difference in
performance between these processors
isn't actually as dramatic as it looks
it's if okay he says he fixed it before
but apparently no oh oh he'll fix it
before we are you can download all these
graphs from the link in the video
description and he'll fix it before
uploading it so you guys will see the
correct version in the in the in the
download their metro 2033 the 39 60 X
this is kind of bizarre it just tanks in
this one and we're not really sure why
that happened but this game didn't like
this platform that much the 3770k cleans
up the 8350 shows its jose its strength
so Metro 33 does seem to benefit from
the additional course but then it
doesn't benefit from the additional
course so it might just be an AMD
architectural thing that this game likes
but yeah pretty much all of you say
about that and then Witcher 2 has
everything performing actually pretty
closely so AMD brings up the rear but
even that's only about ten percent
slower than the flagship 3960 X from
Intel and the 3770k which is the fastest
ivy bridge processor right now and
that's pretty much the end of the
slideshow so hopefully this has been
somewhat enlightening and you guys can
sort of see why we actually sort of ran
it hopefully it was interesting thanks
