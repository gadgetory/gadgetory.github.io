the most exciting duel 120 millimeter
radiator prefilled maintenance-free
liquid cooler from Corsair since the H
100 this is the courser h 100 i and we
are going to unbox it and we are going
to find out what is better about it than
the originally 100 because i can already
tell you one thing based on the picture
those fans are so much better than the
ones that are included with the H 100
that it is not even funny anymore
those are looking like Corsairs SP
series fans and those are some serious
business pretty cool fan so let's have a
look at what we got on the outside of
the packaging to start with here so okay
extreme performance liquid CPU cooler I
can believe that all right we got some
cool specs bro and some sort of okay
moving right along we've got some
comparisons to the Intel Box cooler
which is just totally unfair to this
cooler why do they compare to the Intel
Box cooler what's the point of that they
should compare to other high performance
coolers because it can show itself as
being like pretty fast kicking at that
level as well hydro serious requires a
case with two 120 millimeter fan mounts
on top with 15 millimeter spacing for
standard dual radiators okay magnetic
mounting bracket and mounting hardware
Corsair link cable those are two other
very cool things that are included with
this cooler so what is a magnetic
mounting bracket I have no idea
stop don't return it to the store and
product solutions guide aa manual
warranty information notification for
Australian consumers this is a sample
from Corsair so I guess they sent me an
Australian sample okay so you got some
pretty cool instructions for how to
install the back plate fans and
radiators the manticore
oh cool I love it oh I'm super excited
about this okay
so let's start with the cooler actually
I lied we're not going to start with the
cooler we're going to start with other
since we're gonna get everything out of
the box love back in the moment alright
so everything you see in front of me is
extremely exciting because it's all part
of this whole package deal thing that we
got going on here so first things first
most boring possible part all the screws
and mounting hardware and whatnot so you
got all the screws you need to mount
your fans to your rad you got all the
screws you need to mount your Intel
whatnot to your Intel other whatnots and
then you've got these little pieces for
for mounting on AMD
these guys are for putting around your
CPU sockets so this is pretty similar to
what we saw on the original h100 except
for the coolest thing ever check this
out instead of a sort of no offense to
the previous generation course or
product but kind of horrible and total
pain in the butt system that we had
before now if you want to change what
socket you want to mount on please go
like that and then you put your chair so
you put your little brackets under here
if you want to mount on AMD just like
that you put the screw on the top of it
and it's done then you can just pull it
off like this no big deal
intel mount just like this no big deal
so awesome this is great for guys like
me who are swapping sockets all the time
and it's just oh just freaking awesome
Universal backplate for everything from
LGA 1155 and 11:56 to 1366 to 2011
actually sorry not 2011 2011 is done
using these ones right here so it does
doesn't this one is not needed but this
piece will still be used for 2011 this
is the universal one so pretty much any
Intel socket you can imagine can be
mounted to with this cooler and I'm
actually going to check on the back of
the box and see if they have support for
looks like yeah no it doesn't go all the
way back to seven so five however quite
frankly if you're spending over a
hundred dollars on the CPU cooler for
your 775 CPU then you need to adjust
your priorities all right two things
here check this out you can control not
only the two fans that are included with
the H 100 I using one of these little
adapters right here that takes your 4
pin or 3 pin fan can do whichever you
want and uses the built-in corsair link
software that can be controlled from
your desktop to adjust your fan profiles
and monitor your coolant temperature and
all kinds of cool stuff like that but
you can also plug in another one totally
optional you don't have to plug it in
it's up to you the choice is yours
you're the consumer and you can control
an additional two fans just like that so
cool love to see these kinds of options
and Corsair is so good at aesthetics
every wire is black it just looks
perfect like everything about it is just
just perfect just awesome Corsair link
interfaces with your system using a
simple USB connection so you got to do
is plug this guy into here so you're
going to go ahead you're going to have
that on your socket you're going to run
this around the back of your motherboard
and plug it into your USB header on your
motherboard oh and this looks way better
than the older one as well actually this
is everything about this is better that
looks fantastic let's go ahead and take
this off so you guys can really see a
nice glossy Corsair logo going on there
very very very very sleek the fans let's
talk about the fans that are included so
these are kind of like a liquid okay I
hate to use this word but kind of like a
cheapo version of the espys where they
have the same blade design the same
frame design but we lose the rubber
mounts we lose the the interchangeable
coloured rings so these are things that
are just kind of too expensive for an
included OEM style fan yeah this is kind
of cool though there's little spots to
mount what appears these look like LED
mounts but they don't go all the way
through but slick was saying you could
just kind of drill through and you could
probably mount LEDs on it which would be
pretty sweet and they're sort of an off
color but it'll still look very sort of
matching and high performance once
they're spinning and they're on
you're there on your dad like that's
gonna look outstanding so you get two of
those these are way better than what was
included with previous generation
products because these broad blades and
the way that they're swept aren't great
for moving a ton of air in an open
configuration like this but they're
fantastic for moving enough air through
a very very tight thin matrix like this
you can check out my episode on the NCIX
comm channel where I introduced the SP
series fans and talked about how much
better they are for certain applications
now let's get to the cooler itself the
radiator hasn't changed much you got
your standard radiator mounting size you
got your they look like the same thin
density so nothing's really changed here
but Corsair has increased the size of
the coolant hoses
they've also dramatically improved the
quality of them check this out even
though this is 3/8 inch tubing you can
do pretty much whatever you need to do
with it to get it to your CPU socket
this is way better than what we saw
included on the H 100 I have an H 100
over here
which you guys can come out and look at
so see this used a corrugated plastic
that was it wasn't going to kink or
anything but it wasn't very flexible and
it didn't allow you to manage it very
easily so this is definitely way better
nice and soft and we've still got C
these are rotating fittings so that you
can get it wherever you need to get at
the bottom is copper which it better be
and it's got pre applied very high
quality thermal compound you probably
won't even see much improvement from
changing that out to something that's
you know an aftermarket thermal compound
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the course RH
100 I I've recommended the course RH 100
probably a hundred times on Twitter or
Facebook or wherever else and I will do
this exactly the same thing to this one
because it is so much better than single
radiator solutions and the build quality
this looks just outstanding the corsair
link software is a bonus and the fact
that he now includes very competitive
performance fans where previously the h
100 had fans that you probably want to
replace don't forget to subscribe to
