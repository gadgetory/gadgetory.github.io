a $400 portable audio player conceived
by Canadian music legend Neil Young's
company paano
a word that means righteous that raised
over six million dollars on Kickstarter
in early 2014 and while normally I would
refer to a device like this as an mp3
player and it certainly does playback
mp3s that term feels inapplicable here
because mr. young sought to create
something much greater than that know
what mr. Young envisioned was an entire
ecosystem where artists record labels
and music lovers can cooperate to bring
music listening enjoyment to a new level
by making high-resolution audio tracks
both easily available and enjoyable does
it deliver that or is it the worst kind
of snake-oil nonsense that I've seen in
quite some time
I guess we'll find out won't we cooler
masters casemod world series is your
opportunity to show off your modding
skills and win great prizes entries
close February 7th 2015 click now to
learn more let's begin with a physical
overview of the unit it's a triangular
prism for some reason I guess paano
predicted what would happen with the
whole bendgate iphone six-plus thing and
chose what is not only the most been
resistant possible shape but also one
that would be extraordinarily
uncomfortable to sit on if you were to
store the player in your back pocket at
the top of the unit are two
three-and-a-half millimeter jacks that
can be used in four different modes this
one is for standard headphones and has
variable volume control while this one
simply outputs at a constant volume and
is intended for use in the car or
anywhere else where an external app
would take care of volume adjustments if
you want to use both jacks then there
are two modes for you one is Panos share
which lets two people listen to the same
thing at the same time and the second is
balanced output where each connector is
dedicated to left and right audio
something you'll need pretty specialized
equipment or some modding to take
advantage of on the bottom is a microUSB
port for charging and thankfully simple
drag-and-drop music file transfer and a
flap to cover the microSD expansion slot
paano site says mac 64 gigs to go with
the 64 gigs of internal
for a total of 128 but online I found
lots of references to a compatibility
with 128 gig microSD cards so I suspect
their site is a little behind in the
recent advancements in microSD capacity
which brings us around to the front
there are three buttons on the Ponto
player volume up volume down and the
middle circle button which handles play
and pause and then hold for power and
Pavel earned some kudos from me for
these buttons having both distinctive
shapes that are easy to feel for when
you can't see them and a satisfying
tactile feel then promptly lost all of
that kudos and then some the instant
that I looked at the two and a half inch
touchscreen on the front
holy crap this thing is bad I don't
remember the last time I saw such an
atrocious display with abominable
viewing angles like this on a device
that cost more than a hundred bucks to
Panos credit the navigation of there
apparently Android based operating
system is fairly simple and intuitive
mostly swipe sideways to sort music in a
variety of different ways or access
system settings scroll up and down to go
through lists touch to play and swipe
from the bottom for track controls and
cover art but there are some pretty yeah
we're new at this type quirks to the
display auto rotate can be glitchy as
heck the device lacks a wake/sleep
button for the display so you just have
to wait for it to timeout then interact
with the buttons so change the volume or
pause your music to wake it
there's no typing based search for your
music library I guess thanks to the tiny
screen so if you have a lot of music you
can either slow scroll manually or quick
scroll by letter down the right-hand
edge but that option only pops up if you
start slow scrolling first something
that I thought we'd taken care of a
number of years ago none of that stuff
really bothered me though when I was
just using the device and if the Ponto
player was cheap I likely wouldn't even
mention it but the panel isn't cheap
which raises a lot of questions for me
what did they spend all that money on
the screen sucks
there's no wireless connectivity of any
kind so forget streaming your Spotify
music through its amp or anything like
that and the battery life is truly
abominable with it's 29 50 milliamp hour
battery delivering a mere 8 hours of
playback I had distance 15 years ago
that could do better than that now hold
on a minute Linus
this isn't some Swiss Army knife device
I don't give a rat's patoot if it
bluetooths or read 230 toothpicks how
does it sound will it cause my soul to
rediscover music well it transport me to
a sublime musical experience no of
course not don't be silly
I decided on my son Heiser HD six
hundreds for most of my listening tests
but spent some time with my IE 80s as
well since it is a portable player and I
threw everything I had at this thing
some high bitrate mozart flax obviously
converted to apple's lossless codec for
the iphone then i purchased back when I
did my geek out review some top 40 crap
both flax and mp3's some rips from a
couple of bare naked lady scenes I had
lying around and anyway output volume
was leveled across my test devices and
iPhone 6 and the panel player for apples
to apples mobile devices with an o2 and
ode acuse periodically as a sanity check
I used my ex text and level meter and a
1 kilohertz test tone at 80 decibels to
level everything off and in spite of
Panos claims that their player will make
everything from the high-definition
tracks on their webstore to the
crappiest mp3 sound better no matter how
long I sat in a dark room with my eyes
closed
listening to the same segments of song
over and over again no matter what track
from what genre I listened to I just
couldn't hear a compelling argument for
why the paano player has any right to
exist especially at this price point
other than as a transparent attempt to
build non tech savvy people for money
with empty promises of an experience
that it simply can't deliver but - there
are so many testimonials from everyone
from audio files to regular people to
Neil Young himself who are saying the
Ponto player is an experience unlike
anything else and yeah I guess so but
while mr. Young talks a good talk about
making high-quality audio tracks
available to the masses something I
actually very strongly agree with what
he ignores is that the bitrate has very
little to do with the quality of a track
past a certain point while mastering
technique has everything to do with it
and I don't know whether it's ignorance
or willful deception but I can't take
anything the guy says seriously about
this when it gets on camera and talks
about the superior dynamic range of
analog
Media vs. CDs when even laymen like me
no that's categorically incorrect logon
has so much dynamic range that when it
hits you it hits you with the full
envelope of dynamics and I really hope
it was some misinformed peon at pas no
that got quoted by Engadget as saying
that the engineering being done by ire
allowed the panel player to have no
amplifier per se what does that even
mean
it runs on pixie dust sheesh player
aside though and mr. Young has made it
abundantly clear that they don't really
even want to make players forever
presumably because letting someone else
make the Ponto certified HD audio
players then selling music to those
customers online is much more lucrative
paano can still do some good in the
world if it raises awareness about the
importance of high-quality audio files
and makes them more accessible to more
people but my cynicism hat here is
whispering in my ear that what's that
Gryffindor no wrong hat here thank you
is whispering in my ear that from Panos
actions they don't appear to care about
any of that because if they did there
wouldn't be a a snake-oil indicator on
the player to tell you you're getting
the best possible experience solely
because you obtained the song from their
store when in truth there are plenty of
other places online to buy equally high
res audio that won't light up that
indicator if they cared they would be
educating about the importance of
quality mastering versus loudness
mastering rather than trying to convince
people they need 24 bit 192 kilohertz
files to hear everything when it's been
empirically proven that they actually
sound worse and their store might let me
by don't know much by Linda Ronstadt by
itself instead of forcing me to spend a
hundred and twenty-five dollars on her
entire 80s studio album collection in
order to get the highest quality version
so move along everyone while your
experience may vary if you're one of the
few people with extremely difficult to
drive electrostatic headphones or other
exotic solutions as far as the other
99.99% of people are concerned the only
reason
the paw no player can apparently deliver
80 to 90% of the performance of a
$27,000 amplifier according to the
designer of both is not because it is
made of magic but because there was
nothing special about that amp either
it's all in the way the information is
being spun to you speaking of spin I
don't really need to put any spin on
today's episode sponsor ting because
their business model really speaks for
itself
ting only charges their users for the
amount of service that they actually use
that means whether you're a power user
or you only have a smartphone out of
necessity and you'd be happier with a
cinco-fone than that you'll be paying a
fair amount for the service that you use
no locked-in 200 minutes of talk however
many Meg's of data just what you
actually need to news every month they
operate on the Sprint network so
anywhere with good sprint service will
have good ting service and starting in
February so in about a week here they'll
be running on a GSM network meaning that
you'll be able to use about 80% of the
smart phones available in the market
today including the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
one big thing with ting is that they
will actually tell you how much you
would pay on ting before you sign up
exactly just head over to Linus team
comm and use their savings calculator to
enter your last few bills and they'll
spit out how much you would have paid by
switching to ting so give it a try
they'll even give you 25 bucks off a new
device or $25 in service credit pretty
awesome offer from a pretty awesome
mobile provider thanks to your
sponsoring this episode thanks you for
watching it like this video if you liked
it just like it if you thought it sucked
leave a comment if you have something
else to say I'm sure it's gonna be a
flame war down there though so uh unless
you've got your a flame-retardant suit
on might just want to stay out of the
comments on this one
speaking of flame retardant suits Lynas
tech tips shirts are fully flame
retardant so you're gonna want to buy
those over on the link in the video
description they're not flame-retardant
please don't let yourself on fire with
my instictive shirt we assume no
reliability for etcetra etcetra etcetra
also linked in the video description you
can give us a monthly contribution or
you can change your amazon bookmark to
one with our affiliate code so every
time you buy a Pollin pono player
I'll make $32 I'm still not gonna
recommend that you buy it because I
don't need your $32 that badly but
apparently mr. Yeung does thanks for
watching and as always don't forget to
