new product and its new in the sense
that it's not even released in North
America yet this is the fractal design
define our two computer case this is a
Sweden based company okay and this is
their first case or well their first
three because it comes in three
different colors so let's have a look at
what makes this case unique first of all
it has a stylish front panel book noise
insulated door so the first thing you'll
notice about it is it has a very very
sleek design there's really nothing to
it it's very clean looking okay so it
has a unique mod you got a feature that
allows you to choose between optimal
silence or optimal airflow so we'll show
you that in a minute
in fact if noise absorbing panels
mounted on the side and top ten drive
bays including eight internal three and
a half inch base and two external five
and a quarter inch base I love to see
this because how many times have you
seen a computer that actually has nine
five and a quarter inch devices in it
and yet that seems to be the trend with
so many cases these days I'm glad to see
a focus on more hard drives since that's
what people are actually adding to their
computers sturdy overall case quality to
front 120 millimeter fans with one
included to top 120 or 140 millimeter
fans and those are optional one rear 120
millimeter fan included one side 120
millimeter or 140 millimeter fan
optional bottom 120 or 140 millimeter
fan optional and a bottom in table for
the power supply so you can see that
despite the fact that they marketed as a
silent case you can actually load it up
with a great deal of fans and still get
good cooling performance out of it now
you should notice that this is wow this
is just tape like crazy really wish I'd
gone and got the knife before I started
this but what
gonna do this is actually David's way
here as a as a sample all the way from
Sweden so you can see that the job they
do packing it and the box that they use
is actually good enough to survive at a
ground shipment first across Europe and
then across Canada actually landed in
Toronto so and then it made its way all
the way to two new men oh yeah here are
the three colors so the ones that we
have here is Black Pearl and it's also
available in titanium gray and Silver
Arrow oh and then we've actually got
some pictures over here so I'll let you
enjoy those pictures while I continue to
work away at this tape with my
screwdriver because the tip keeps coming
out when I try to jam it through the
tape and this is not not working out for
me I would have perhaps hoped there we
go I finally have the Box open so the
first thing we find inside is a user's
manual for the define r2 ATX case they
give you a little bit of information so
the product is guaranteed for one year a
little bit about the concept of fractal
design designed and engineered in Sweden
excellent they give you an overall list
of the features ok cool maybe open now
what I've heard about this case from the
couple of North American reviews that
we've seen so far is that it smells bad
when you first open it and that's the
result of the noise dampening material
that they use in the side panels and the
top so apparently the smell goes away
after about a week so it's one of those
things where yeah that's a sacrifice you
have to make so it comes packed in
as long as you're using a good quality
box I guess it's about an inch of foam
and it's a good quality foam so you're
not gonna run into issues where it'll
crack in shipment like you can see it's
the flexible type so those thin foams
where it uses the hard foam and it can
crack you can find that those cases can
end up arriving damaged but this one
looks like it would be just fine and I
mean it did make its way here from
Sweden so here we have it the fractal
design are to the front ok so why don't
we start with the outside of this guy so
up at the top here we've got the power
button which glows blue when it's on
then we've got the front headphones and
mic two USB ports on one eSATA port and
then we can open up the front ok that's
kind of nice so in the front we first do
we have the sound deadening foam and you
can see that the way that the oh
actually I don't know how the front fans
get access to airflow I think there are
oh there's ventilation here oh this is
kind of smart so the ventilation all
comes out the side of the front panel ok
and that is how the fans which sit
behind here actually get access to
airflow and you can see that these have
filters on them and you undo the screws
here and then you can pull out the fans
that way that's kind of nice so then
you've got one five and a quarter inch
and one five and a quarter inch with a
three and a half inch external adapter
so you could potentially do like your
blu-ray drive and your media card reader
something like that would be sort of the
recommended configuration for a case
like this front door has a magnet so it
actually shuts in place just like that
overall quality of the front door is
good you don't see any warping or
anything like that alright so moving
around this side of the case is very
plain very clean you can see there's a
little bit of residue on it from the
packing so that should come off in due
time around at the back we've got a
couple of holes for water cooling I mean
most people don't really use these but
what are you going to do we have one 120
millimeter fan and it's the little
touches like this but I like to see
we've got white PCI
back pleats okay so it looks kind of
sharp at the back a little bit more
ventilation space and then there's a
case for your bottom mounted or there's
a case there's a spot for your bottom
mounted power supply so let's take off
the side panel and see what we find on
the inside side panel is officially off
wow that's heavy oh okay yeah there is
our sound dampening material right there
so it's got kind of a sticky grippy feel
to it okay and this part comes away for
you to mount a 140 millimeter fan on the
side if you're not quite as concerned
about noise and you're more concerned
about cooling so the inside of the case
you can see it features a lot of sort of
up-to-date features for example you've
got the cutaway hole for the CPU cooler
so that means that you can install a new
CPU cooler without taking out the
motherboard that's a great feature I'd
love to see it you've got an overall
white and black color scheme so you can
see the fans are white in black the PCI
back plates are white and black included
fans are sleeved it's not a great
quality sleeping but it's functional and
it looks a lot better than seeing bear
fan wires okay up in the top aha they've
got there they're sound dampening
material which you can remove and mount
120 millimeter fans or 140 millimeter
fans that's very cool I'm guessing
that's their mod you vent feature which
allows you to either turn things into a
vent or turn them into something that
doesn't allow sound to escape this is
something I want to see more of all of
the front panel connectors are black
already because most people are going to
want them black when's the last time you
saw like a a red sleeved power supply
for example so if you want it to match
the rest of your case that's a great way
to make sure that it happens all right
other things to note first of all the
entire interior of the case is painted
this is something that I want to see
more of especially on cases in this
price range you've got these cool rubber
grommets that we've seen on a couple
cases I've seen it on the NZXT haiti's
obviously it debuted on the Corsair
obsidian 800 D but it makes cable
management just way way more convenient
okay so let's have a look down here
bottom mounted power supply with the
vent holes
so that means you can turn it this way
so that the fan is on the bottom and it
will draw fresh air from the bottom of
the case and then again you can put a
120 or 140 millimeter fan here okay so
there's your tween it half inch adapt
through there okay all of the
accessories come in a little box right
here oh you can see oh look at that one
of our three and a half inch hard drive
sleds actually came dislodged in
shipping so why don't we have a quick
look here on camera even to see if that
actually damaged the case so we've
damaged our paint job a little bit but
it's nothing too significant and when we
go to slide it back in oh it's just fine
okay well that's I'm really glad to see
that I would have hated for that to be
damaged so let's have a look at what
we've got included here for accessories
a lot of screws tons and tons of screws
so you've got longer screws there for
the hard drives
you got your motherboard standoffs the
standard brass kind you've got screws
for optical drives and you've got screws
for the motherboard awesome oh this is
nice oh this is really nice cool check
this out okay so they've actually
included a fan controller it's what a
white pci bracket powder coated white
just to match the rest of the white ones
at the back alright and then you can
plug in ah looks like three fans oh
that's that's terrific so it's actually
got a splitter that allows you to
simultaneously use this knob to control
three of the fans in your case and then
it's just got a little power adapter
just like that that is a very that's
little touches like that that really set
something apart from the from a
competition alright so here is our one
two three four five six seven eight
harddrive sleds and I actually did give
you a closer look at these these are
powder coated white and you can see that
they've got rubber grommets to isolate
the hard drive against noise alright so
overall I'd say we've had a pretty good
look at the fractal designs are too
