issues with my media PC it's got a
geforce gtx 660ti some core i5 or
something like that and it basically
what happens is I launch a game and it
runs great for a little while and then
the frame rate starts to tank now if
you're familiar with thermal throttling
you probably know what I'm about to show
you here but if you're not then we'll go
ahead and show you what's going on so
you can see here GPU temperatures are
pinned at about 100 and 101 degrees and
then if we go ahead and scroll down you
can see our fan speed is pinned at 81
percent which is the maximum that it'll
do
and then finally yes this my friends
this is the core clock it should be at
around 1 gigahertz plus and instead it's
hovering between 500 and 81 megahertz
and even dipping as low as 191 so this
system is thermal throttling and there's
something that we need to do about it
the flash voyager GTX USB 3 drive from
Corsair provides SSD like performance
and fits comfortably in your pocket
click now to learn more so this is the
problem even with the graphics card
doing nothing sitting and idling it's at
about 50 degrees so modern GPUs don't
run much hotter than the ambient
temperature which means with this
cabinet closed it is roasting in there
even when the computers not doing
anything so I guess one solution would
be to just have it open all the time but
that's pretty lame and another solution
that I was doing which is terrible was
just hanging the computer out here but
you can see I actually damaged the lip
here quite a bit doing that so obviously
we need something better so while I
could have concluded that the solution
is to put a less powerful computer in
there ya know we're going to add cooling
to the cabinet instead so I've gathered
a drill soldering iron wire stripper saw
dremel tool measuring tape cooling fans
fan grills fan power splitter inline
resistors external power supply for the
fans or perhaps some sacrificial stuff
to do like
DIY something-or-other a whole sauce and
miscellaneous nuts-and-bolts clear and
electrical tape a paper template or four
for cutting 120 millimeter fan holes and
then a vacuum for cleaning up it's going
to be a fun day okay so with the system
out I'd actually kind of forgotten the
configuration in this case I thought
there was a vent on the bottom but there
isn't other than this intake right here
so that changes how I plan to put the
fans in but what I want to do is I want
to get the exhaust from the case so
that's the top 120 millimeter fan here
and then the power supply fan at the
back I want to get that out of the
cabinet and then I want to bring fresh
air to the intake which for this case
the only real intake is here on the
bottom so what I may end up doing is
changing the graphics card from a
internal recirculating cooler design to
like an open cooler design to one that
has a rear exhaust on it so we'll have
to figure that out later let's see if
this works for so my original plan was
to do one 120 millimeter intake down
here then I was going to do like a side
intake over here to account for their
two exhausts that I'm going to do at the
top back here but um my wife actually
brought up that if I do decide to put a
hole in the bottom of the case for some
passive intake for the the fan on the
graphics card and if I just put these
both here covering the entire bottom of
the case I'll always have a computer
here in all likelihood so I just put
them both here all right so here we are
all the templates are taped into place
so I will start by drilling out the four
holes and then hole sawing the middles
all right moment of truth time although
we did have a realization this is a lot
thicker than the back material so I'm
going to need some different bolts but
we're
okay let's check and make sure that
these are even the right size and that's
pretty tight I would have to actually
screw them through I'd rather have a
little looser okay okay so we've got all
the holes drilled except the big ones
where I had kind of a scary moment here
when I realized my drill just barely
barely fits so we want to get this lined
up as perfectly as we can my hole saw is
not actually 120 millimeters it's a
little bit smaller so I guess if I'm off
by a little bit is not a huge deal
because we're not making the best use of
the space anyway but here we go
well I got started and realized I wasn't
wearing safety goggles in the way this
spins is basically throwing sawdust
right in my face so here we go
there we go piece number one that I
accidentally drew on it while I was
pulling it up is done let's find out if
a fan fits shall we so we're going to
kind of sit like bearish well probably
on the bottom of the cabinet and then
I'll have to I'll have to filter them
with maybe like some Silverstone filters
or something like that
so there you go well be Intakes though
but the point is just do they fit and
the answer is yes they do
so these fans have little wire
management Clips here and I realized
either I can wire manage them under here
which is just going to be kind of a pain
in the butt or I can just have just this
one clip hold them down and I can put
them in place this way I'll bring them
up here manage them together over here
and then route them to the fan splitter
so well this is the moment of truth
where we find out if they actually fit
so far it's going really well
there we go all right so that's how
they'll go on okay so my project has a
helper oh yeah you're a really good
helper which of course means that I'm
making really you know great progress at
this point anyway all the fans are on so
I don't know if you have an angle to see
the ones at the back
there we go so all the fans are on and
now I've added the swift tag fan hub so
this has a molex power and as well as a
PWM control lead that I'm actually not
going to be using I'm just going to use
this for power because I'm going to run
all these fans at full speed they're
only twelve hundred rpm fans so they're
they're quite quiet so I'm just going to
use the included adhesive mount here to
note this in the back corner and other
than that the cabinet itself I think for
fear of getting ahead of myself is
pretty much there mostly I didn't use
grills but at the back for these fans
I'm using grills just because with all
the wires hanging around here I don't
want anything getting caught in them
another thing that I'm gonna have to add
later is some kind of a filter for these
bottom ones excuse me
just because without a filter those are
going to be drawing air directly off the
floor so I've got a couple options for
what I can use I rip this off a
Silverstone case ripped this off of a
Corsair case but I'll have to figure out
a system for mounting it so I can easily
get at it later oh yeah fan control in
case I decide the fans are too loud I
might use these inline resistors so as
with any project like this you know wife
roadblocks can be a bit of an issue and
I got the approval for the time and
money to spend on this little project
and then it started taking a lot longer
than originally advertised so I'm
simplifying it a little bit totally my
choice this is the way I wanted to do it
not the way that I'm about to tell you
so what I really wanted to do mmm well
as I wanted to cut this up here okay and
then just have this power lead lead to a
power connector on the back of the case
so I was just going to find somewhere
and Dremel out a rectangular hole and
then use these screws to secure it there
then what I was going to do was I was
going to create a custom adapter so I
was going to plug this in here and then
I was going to splice this one on here
so that I could get a so that I could
have the correct lead to plug into my
fan controller so we're scrapping that
and instead we're going to do it what my
wife thinks is the more is the less
ghetto
but I personally think is way more
ghetto and we're just going to run a
4-pin molex connector out this spot
right here at the back where just like
this where normally this piece closes
down on top of the the PCI bracket so
we're just going to kind of close it in
like that and we're just going to have a
lead like that so I'd love to hear your
feedback was my way cutting holes in the
case the more get away or as my wife's
way repurposing this home and just
having a power supply cable hanging out
here like it's so ugly
not that I'm leading you in the
direction of which way I think you
should vote but there you go well if
nothing else we've got power out the
back of the case now so we're pretty
much ready to rock all right so this is
I guess a good opportunity to show you
guys the internals of this case so
there's a 140 millimeter fan in the
front that takes them from that filtered
intake
this down here is what I'm going to have
to cut up in order to get more airflow
to this graphics card if it comes to
that and then other than that yeah I
guess we've got this routed over to the
side of the CPU socket here so it's
going to be pretty much out of the way
I'm just gonna this is my power supply
with the custom shortened cables for
Mini ITX that I had in my old media PC
so I changed my mind about how I'm going
to mount the fan controller I decided to
screw it in just because it has spots
for that so as long as these are small
enough oh yeah that's not that ideal is
it as long as they don't split then as I
go through them can they make it oh yeah
my funny there you go I got an
endorsement from my two year old I'm
funny too two year olds
so everything's wired back up now
overall I'd say the project was uh well
I mean I haven't seen temperatures yet
but I went really well went really
quickly although there was one sacrifice
that had to be made the receiver dongle
for my my air mouse / keyboard thing
that I actually find very very useful
got rolled over when I was showcasing
the PC in the first place so that's a
real shame but I guess now is the moment
of truth
okay so we've got it put back in there
I'd say it's not quite as quiet as I'd
like and what I'll probably do as a v2
of this of this little mod is get to
four pin fan extensions and then change
out the fans for PWM fans and then I'll
go from the from the Swift tech PWM
splitter to the CPU header and then I'll
go from my CPU cooler out to the PWM
splitter so I'll use those two
extensions there and then I'll be able
to have my CPU fan and then all four of
the cabinet fans running according to
CPU temp with the motherboard BIOS so
that'll be version two but for now it's
it's definitely tolerable but let's see
what the results are like so at idle
we're looking at 41 degrees which is a
10 degree improvement and that is of
course not the real test so let's get
Tomb Raider going on and let's uh let's
let her cook for a bit shall we
okay so I've had the same scene running
for about half an hour it's time to welt
abode and see how we did keep you
temperature 94 95 degrees okay so that's
still pretty toasty but core clock ah
we're even getting some turbo boost
so yes it's still warm I think to take
it to the next level I would have to do
something about the bottom of that
system or install some kind of a blower
type GPU so that I'm not recirculating
the hot air within the system itself but
what we've done is we've lowered the
cabinet temperatures enough that the
card is at least able to keep itself
under control so there you go mission
accomplished guys like the video if you
liked it dislike it if you just liked it

want to see any more of this kind of
vlog e here
what I do on my weekends sort of because
I probably wouldn't do this on my
weekend if this wasn't my job but I did
it because I it was my job and I kind of
wanted to do it someday anyway if you
