rig they can for $500 the rules are
simple
you'll work within the set hours you buy
the parts you use and you can't use your
influence as a youtuber to get deals oh
and the best RGB computer gets a 10%
score bonus welcome to scrap yard and
now we got to figure out where to go
next
is you're hoping by now the South Orange
County option would would be where we
could have to go but discovered some
motherboard h61
that you can't overclock this so it
wouldn't be much point of getting in 26
arte an h-60 one mother were also
sneaky-ass which we've got we've got the
second guy John who has the same CPU
2600 K but he actually has a z68 board
which we could overclock with and he's
in Aliso Viejo which is about the same
direction as the last guy so it could
work out I texted him offer two hundred
for both of them he hasn't replied yet
I'm just going to call him maybe are you
gonna call your guy first or only
holding office have to have yeah okay
and we could honestly come by right now
if you're available we would probably be
maybe 20 minutes or so but obviously
they're not busy yeah em I can fix
your address and yep your first drop by
okay yeah just text me over the address
and we'll be on our way so Marie had a
guy with the 2600 K and the e CS
motherboard that's 861 which we cannot
overclock on I asked him if we could
film it the motherboard for a cheaper
price I offered him 160 bucks for 2600 K
8 gigs of memory which is dual-channel
and 180 s gig SSD which uh turn 80 gigs
that capacity means we probably wouldn't
need a hard drive so that could also
save us some money and
he seems like a pretty reasonable guy
but he also just wanted to ripped off
obviously so just be really go be quick
guy in Murrieta
20600 cage replied to our $160 offer and
said I will pass I think is roughing
maybe bluffing are you are you bluffing
are you me are you see me this
is an industrial area or commercial zone
and I don't know again it's going to be
situation they're either going to try to
barter really hard and get as much money
out of us as possible or if they really
just have a bunch of stuff stored and
you want to get rid of it then maybe we
can maybe we can English so we've always
come to a place that has lots of parts
and they seem to be pretty reasonable
prices and they have some slightly older
stuff but not too old so lots of options
here just matter what they have on hand
China is definitely a power supply right
now and they might have GPUs as well
which could walk into the alien place or
alien place the Ilion warehouse there
were a couple people who sort of looked
at me and Paul and kind of raised an
eyebrow like I recognize you and
fortunately they weren't employees so I
think that helped but I think you know
obviously Ed's will also helped us and
like kind of like nudge the guide the
Phantom's like you know quiet ixnay on
the ball and Kyle say or whatever but it
was cool to meet them after the deal was
done to sort of you know shake hands be
like hey what's up thanks for not
ruining everything from so it'll work
out they were mentioning some talk of
some fairly affordable 900 series
geforce cards which definitely piqued
our interest I think are very
overclockable that's the nice indeed and
you know they've got power supplies hard
drives they also have a z97 board for
like 50 bucks or something I'm currently
trying to email a guy for a 46
70 K potentially if we can get that
hooked up and be nice w sweet
so we just came out pretty fat with some
components here we've got a power supply
from Rosewill and we got a to 4,000 watt
power supply so we've got some little
room there for power tea for cooler z97
motherboard no cpu yet and also a hard
drive we got all this for what 80 bucks
80 bucks
so my place is called Elyon wholesale
and we found them via a Craigslist ad
for cases and it was just like what
we're looking for a warehouse just piled
with stuff all slightly old and willing
to make a deal for quite a few parts so
this definitely gives it some wiggle
room we spent less than $100 and we need
to locate the big-ticket item so CPU
graphics cards yeah so we're gonna need
to has well no no yeah as well or
Devil's Canyon something like that we're
looking for a 4690k right now I've got a
few leads on Craigslist hopefully that
works out we're also missing a modular
table for this power supply for the
peripheral we'll have to work that out
but yeah yeah okay so I guess we got a
potential strategy we can go with here
too since we don't have a GPU yet but we
do have a motherboard with video outs so
let's say we don't get the GPU sell
tomatoes if someone wants to meet in the
evening one of us could stay back and
get the system up and running the
windows loaded and stuff if somebody
else goes out to pick up a GPU and that
wood we can do that right yes we can
split up we never told Interpol no
second I ain't wondering all right I
think it's lunchtime though yeah I'm
hungry so right now we're meeting up
with a guy named John who by some
miracle is selling his 4690k core i5 for
140 bucks seems like there's no strings
attached I guess we'll find out when we
get there but that's putting us in even
better shape than we are now
if we can get that part so for that much
that yeah it's very close there's only
12 minute drive from where we had lunch
I guess we're on our way there now so I
think at that point just need the main
part after this assuming that we don't
get mugged here is going to be the
graphics card and it gives us plenty of
time we've got all the rest of today
it's only 1:30 p.m. and we're already
getting a pretty decent CPU and a bunch
of other stuff
well I guess I could've just waited till
I got the card yeah but he said he was
running at a four point four to four
point six which is at 1.3 1.2 1.3 volts
that'll do that'll do Pig okay so we're
looking up gtx 980ti at this point we
only have about 170 to 200 bucks to
spend two hundred really if we need to
we can return the RGB LEDs I'm down to
do that for an IVP i I'm looking right
now in Craigslist they're all like $300
and up but I pretty much have crafted an
email that I'm sending out to this guy
saying hello can I can give you $200
cash for the gtx 980ti and i'll drive to
you i know that's a pretty low offer but
that's literally all the money I have
left and I need that card more than
anything if you've ever wanted to pay it
forward to a fellow bro this is your
chance take it before it's too late
and I'm planning the copy-paste that to
all the gtx 980ti users on Craigslist
right
I hope there's no one who's like selling
more than one of them and gets the
message for both Oh ray update REM
updates Oh Ram guy Ram guys guys had all
the RAM that's why we call the RAM guy
he actually came back finally after all
Day of Silence he was like I can do it
for 20 bucks so that's $10 off of other
Ram guy so I'm going to cancel other Ram
guy and go with primary Ram guy and get
it for like 10 bucks less and that we
can put towards a better graphics card
you know you know Cal that's RAM tastic
okay so once I convinced blindness and
Brandon that it might not be the worst
idea to get on a plane and go to Palo
Alto we took off I had to get us to the
hotel immediately once we got to the
hotel I threw the car in park ran inside
got both all three of our passports and
we sort of made it wait what ah hold on
if this guy has a phone number I'm going
to call right now because phone number

okay all right okay bye okay so let's
just start driving towards the airport

workstation guys then we will stop
driving towards the airport
like basically the next hour we either
win this competition or we lose and like
we have nothing I can cry like I'll cry
if that's what it takes
I need the system okay it's been 19
minutes I'm calling call it 19 minutes
what was his name
close the name Kim Kim Kim Kim
Patrick hi I'm calling for Tim Tim yeah
I don't have to wait um oh I'm confused

I'm calling for Tim or Kim is what's
your name again my name is ash ash yeah
Prince Larry just one moment let me go
grandma for you awesome thank you so I'm
so sorry to call again apologize for me
please don't worry okay did you find
that it so arms guy you backed me out
right now it's going to be back probably
about 30 minutes he said that you can
double-check the computer because
there's a few things you have to check
before we can sell it but that we may
have one I don't know how long you're
going to be in town but I have your
contacts I can give you boss he gets
back checking system ok I pretty much
need to drive there right now it's late
really it's a very long really stupid
story but like is it is it like so ok so
if you giving me the go-ahead on that my
pricing is not totally unreasonable can
we just can we just come there we're
we're really techie we could even test
it for you guys so you don't have to
hassle around with like whether it works
or not and we're not asking for a
warranty or anything like that that I'd
have to find out I think the price would
be a little more it'll probably be
closer to like 3 but that I would have
to I would have to talk to him and make
sure ok ah hold on let me let me pull up
my spreadsheet we're working on a really
really fixed budget here closer to so
would it be 300 with the SSD and CPUs
will be the one the unit that we have it
doesn't have a shoe inside and then the
other one and it have a hard drive
either so it'd be without those Oh No
okay but as soon as you get back I can
have contact guys you know kind of see
where you're at and we'll work something
out
I honestly I have to know in like the
next two minutes
could I call - I call a solemn see if I
can work something out with them uh yes
you want to do that and then go back
yeah sure could could I get his cell
number I'm so sorry
well you think you might be driving
right up to you not even the knob Oh No
yes Andy in the back you have to check
on the specs and then kind of do the
clean process make sure everything is
you know wives and everything's gone
okay yeah okay um
okay okay okay okay it's time to point
basics like if we can't if we can't get
something done with you guys we we have
to go try and book something at the
counter and and walk on like immediately
like we're in the parking garage I mean
I am pretty sure
let me check I don't have a system
that's probably ready to go but that's
going to have you know the hard drive
it's going to have like everything in
there it's going to be closer to our
press that we have online which I'm sure
it's over like three hundred and Coach
circles for like four that's what this
is just like ready to go
back in not me something like that I can
check on that we can't we can't do that
like we can Frank and Frank and signing
together something is much easier and
better for us okay
okay I'll just have to let you know if
anything changes
thank you yeah no problems are go then
okay thanks anyways all right
circling we have eight we have eight
minutes okay part part like that yeah I
don't know we got to call them then get
over tomorrow because if we can't
schedule for tomorrow then we don't have
a system anyways okay and we just have
to go to Michael and get a system yeah
just go just go part I'm going to call
Michael right now
I thought these guys were going to come
through it seemed like we were pretty
close to being able to get something
done like I don't think we can I don't
think we can fly out there because like
we're still two dollars over even if
everything goes according to plan
hi Michael hey um having a rough day to
be perfectly honest are you in the shop
right now are you able to basically
every other deal we've tried to get done
here is collapsing around us right now
you had said you had decent towers that
we could put the video card in for like
pretty affordable like what kind of
specs are you talking casebook do I just
look into my lip right now it seems
pretty cool evaporation okay kind of old
but you can do it in there I'll for you
guys um I'll throw you guys a Lenovo
ThinkCentre it's an i7 3770 eating some
random a terabyte hard drive how much
could that be we think about a weird
thing about 200 200 okay so we would
still need
can you okay this is going to this might
this might be annoying but could you
could you do an SSD for that and then
could we bail on the video card
what del Pilar obviously we have a so
long story we have to build the best
computer we can here for 500 and we had
a lead on a 980 TI for 300 okay you know
you know what has our nationís yeah all
right man I'll throw the paper part I'll
throw the other thing do a 120 Tommy see
I got a 120 so 120 or 60 I mean would
you be cool with a 6-0 Disney before
point 120 would help a lot I can advance
on 128 SSD in here and of course
tomorrow so I want to try to help out
okay you I want to have just saved our
day in a lot of ways that won't be clear
until until all this plays out um we are
a we're rich we are driving there right
now Wow okay so just to confirm thirty
seven seventy eight gigs ram some
motherboard
just know I'm going to let you know
right now small form factor but the
multiple or get base normal case yeah
yeah okay that's that's cool that's fine
not like we thought like one of those
like weird architectures like in HP's
and some like the Philips but no it's
like if you can system up working in the
other it's cool do if you have a model
number for it by any chance
yeah sorry to rush off I'm with another
customer right now legacy budget okay
just go bail you've done you've done
enough we're on our way we're coming all
right I'll see you through okay thanks
dude how much is that pulley we just got
CPU motherboard RAM SSD and case oh my
god I don't know climbed so I gotta help
these including a power supply 200 bucks
the worst case scenario we take the 980
also from Michael we get everything from
one source and we still have a 3770 with
a GTX 980 yeah but if we can I'm going
to start following up 980ti v so the
good news is I don't actually know how
much time we wasted 40 minutes - Michael
I got a let I gotta let Omid know that
we don't need those CPUs and Justin
they're not the emphasis
and just to know that we're not taking
it if they're currently trying to part
that over yeah okay now I get to spend
all the ISO email okay well I'm going to
let Dustin down first because we're
definitely not going to Palo Alto yeah
whereas I'm still going to follow up the
workstation lead I'm going to see if we
can get the dual CPUs done so I'm going
to keep only hanging still yeah okay hey
Justin I feel terrible but we just found
up 3770 gaming CPU for the decay really
really no I doubt it for really really
cheap and you're going that route
instead you guys were awesome and I'll
recommend you to everyone I know
hi is this Anthony yeah hi I'm calling
about your 980ti on Craigslist okay can
you know I actually just sold it last
time I offered this guy 275 and he said
thanks for the offer but as it stands
I'm still offering the cheapest 980ti
and he's right what if I say should I
just go straight to our limit just go
okay 290
okay hold it I would say what about 280
and a one terabyte hard drive external
ok but we don't actually know that we're
getting that hard drive we know we're
getting the SSD if you might want it
like he's already Michael's already
doing us a lot of favours here I don't
think he owes us a hard drive at this
point I want to offer 290 I want to get
a card and I respect let's do let's do
Michael prick
we're like right here let's just see
what we got thought I feel like I've
been in that car forever
okay so we're hoping but we're here
Michael's shop let's go in and see if
we're gonna get a deal down here
oh my slides undone
oh wait wait up I will let you film it
like a picture you look like the white
eye lash dude oh my god oh my god okay
look guy guy that I was just been
texting right now 215 he said 215 I'm
free right now 215 for a 980 i if we get
this card we win scrapyard Wars I do not
think - Lou are getting a 90 I I mean
they might say my crappy s like stuff or
but dude this is a 980 I know Devil's
Canyon this is a freaking miracle if we
pull this off so I I tried to get some
cheap SSDs honestly we just got the $45
one for micro Center if we're gonna get
this 980ti for 215 bucks we need to
return some stuff that we bought the SSD
is a place we can cut corners if we can
just get a 32 gig or even a 64 gig for
less than 45 bucks
and also the RGB LED that just said up a
guy on Craigslist to see if I can get
his strip and not him to strip but his
LED strip and a controller for ten
dollars which is a half the cost it
would save us an additional $10 on the
strip kid that we just got at Micro
Center which would give us technically
enough to buy an IEP I but I got to do
this quickly because I don't know how
long this offers gonna stand I mean he
might be second-guessing himself right
now like 215 am I really gonna do 215
for an IT guy so I got it I got to act
fast right now otherwise my chance could
go wait it would stop you shuffling no
right he just replied hi I was just
about to replace the ad I have a bunch
of items including HDMI cables don't
care the RGB light controller a fan
I've input connectors consider that I'm
selling as a lot for $20 no it's part of
the lot and I want to start getting
together and not piece it out really
he's going to sell it as a lot RGB
strips with with frickin HDMI cables who
are looking for those two exact things
for 20 bucks which is the thing that we
paid for the current kit we have I'm
going to try to even try to work some
magic here I forgot this modular SATA
cable we need to make sure that we want
to make this work with this power supply
so in a SATA plug here you have five
different actual leads going in there
black is grounds yellows 12 volts the
red is 5 volt and I believe the orange
is 3.3 volts I'm going to double
that's make sure I've got that right
because I don't do this often enough to
have that memorized I should have
memorized but anyway if I figure what's
coming out of here then I can repin the
plugs on this end because I've got the
extraction tool just slip them wrap
switch them around to match up with the
proper voltage and then this should work
because we got to have this for our SSD
and our hard drive and since we've got
some fans and a molex plugs probably
also need to do the same thing with this
one with molex okay gtx 980ti guy
replied he said well first off he wants
to meet at a police station I think I
scared him a little bit by now but he
also said he wants to do the trade off
before dark
so he's a vampire um possibly that would
make me scared of him actually no he
would not be event we can we can be
careful we can know that he's not a
vampire that I had that backwards
we should bring garlic just in case but
anyway evening 7:00 p.m. is reasonable
yeah as we go south they shouldn't be
too much traffic and coming back north
is where I'll be rough so if we can meet
him right when it's hopefully letting up
and getting back here shouldn't be plays
bad and then hopefully Starbucks guy or
RGB LED guy would be down to meet up at
7:30 ish in Rancho at the Starbucks that
conventions um 980 i guy can meet right
now he wants me before dark but he
actually has to be somewhere by 5:30
which is in just over an hour so I have
to go right now
I didn't text him right now that I'm on
my way because we're not going to give
up a chance like this
I want to truth sees me rewiring worked
to plug those in
my hands off of it well I switch
beautiful that I proper voltage
reporting on all the rails so it looks
like like they're good I'm going to
choose
that's a good time
your opal sisters maybe you learned how
to do this I actually have no idea what
I'm doing
Lucy I'm home
to bring dinner got a little surprise
for you
the tasty it brands with mine ray T P I
I think just a hint that is gorgeous
it's aunt extreme - I know it's not even
like a reference model that's beautiful
it's awesome and and dual channel eight
gigs two by four hundred I believe
hopefully it works a called the
prettiest but there's a functional hey
yeah but this is really where it's at
the guy did that when I got in the car -
it was really funny because you know how
I kept screaming sweetening the pot I
was like you will be rewarded if you do
a embark on this on this leap of faith
by doing business with me you know
you'll have a reward or something
and like I'm like I show up and like all
right the new line of tech tips is he's
like no no and I'm like whoa so and I
had to explain him like five minutes of
like scrambling like oh my gosh what if
he doesn't want to do it now and I'm
just like talking about he's got like
four billion subscribers and I'm gonna
like shout it shout out your name is
like I was like give a website he's like
no I'm like I'm like a name you have a
name I can say your name he's like Evan
I'm like great and he's like so wait
that's the reward you were talking about
like famous yeah but he was he was a
super cool guy um he ended up going
through with it so we got this bad boy
again although slight catch it was
agreed 215 but I didn't have exact and I
forgot to ask him for change oh I gave
him 220 for it but I think if we return
the SSD and the RGB kit that we got at
my crescendo we just barely break even
okay so it should be okay
looks good I even have front panel
connectors wired up Wow look at you
yep FPC's in the house didn't work done
clean yes fresh fresh cuts has actually
been pretty useful helping me keep track
of all the stuff that we've been
spending gtx 980ti i think our strong
point is certainly the gtx 980ti I think
that's probably going to Surprise them
I don't think that they're going to see
it coming and that's sort of what I'm
guessing right now because I feel more
confident in the graphics card in our
graphics card than our CPU I think that
they might have a faster performing CPU
but not necessarily as quick of a
graphics card so it'll be interesting to
see how that balances out how that all
plays out when we actually run the tests
sure this does not have a removable
drive cage how long is that yeah that
was the only thing that I was concerned
about is that it is a fairly beefy GPU
worst-case scenario we can just hack
sawdust out of here but it's probably a
good 11 12 inches here let's take a look
is that no I know can you wait do six
no there's no way we're going to rip
that out we'll just have to rip it out
if you have tools that can cut through
that yeah okay that's good now I got a
big Queen though doesn't have to be
clean that's fine
you know aesthetics is not nearly
important as pages reforms riveted in
here too so it's okay we'll find a way
I'll put that sucker in there it's less
than we do this piece just cut the end
of the shroud off right that might be
easier will it work without it
I don't know I mean it's just plastic
but I mean I'd rather not do that if we
can avoid it
yeah another yeah I mess up the $10 case
than the Rena dollar graphics card yes
my wait wait I will live film if I can
picture oh you look like the wino ash my
god did you know when we were on the
phone or did you just know when we
showed up no oh okay good hold that
thought when we arrived at Michael's
shop I immediately suspected that he
knew who you were I mean this guy was
way too nice so sorry Ashley
no carry on what they have water
oh um so can you show specific that
we've been bad
we get them by the truckload cool okay
do you have arm weight was that so it
was a 3770 right you have something that
will take a full-height graphics card i
could throw in a case for a little bit
extra and if the motherboards at that
you can drop it okay let's uh I don't
want to do that that's stupid
okay yeah I was looking for something
that could fit a full fledge graphics
card the rest of the 980 yeah yeah and I
suggest that I should get you right now
as far as I 7-zip and II got a we're
pretty flexible if we're allowed to kind
of tool around a bit and mix and match
you know how to get the side panel off
I'm not demonstrating my my skills here
oh there we go
okay we're stationed OB gather
potentially a workstation I mean really
it's like what works okay yeah this
power supply don't work with a standard
case either so we got to be careful on
that one so this is a 37 70 you keep
scram 240 watt max okay so our power
supply is definitely definitely going to
be a problem what you guys happen to be
looking for a power supply so we again
so here's here's the so the deal that we
were trying to do was a dual pocket
workstation you that we were we were
going to get for 300 and then we're
stupid the place we were talking to is
in Palo Alto so we clearly if we're on a
budget clearly plane tickets are not
going to work very well yeah for that
budget welder so we were going to get
that for 300 and then we were going to
pair it with the 980 we were going to
get from you for 200 and our max budget
is 500 however if we can so we have
actually got like six different 980ti
guys kind of on the go for around a
little over three so like 310 so we
basically need the rest of the system
for 200 which means that if we can't get
a third generation Core i7 maybe we
could work with you on something not
very generation ah
but we do need a full-size tower that
can fit this one over here okay I can
this power supply looks like junk this
is an i7 2670 shop that we were looking
for wow that is the derp pused heatsink
design I think I've ever seen so and
this might be the proprietary Asst
this must be like BTX or something maybe
there's HP I don't even think it is but
like this power supply is non-standard
like there's very little that's usable
in here but if this system didn't work
that could actually work in our favor
here's a bear 2600 a bear 2600 CPU yeah
what about a motherboard though you want
to go when they'd have to find an
overclock roll board 2600 K no no you
can still overclock there's a little bit
even though than okay oh that's a thing
everything that's fine also I don't know
the T I believe is two of those two
dates I think so I guess that's it for
the one terrified I could do a 60 to get
this D 4:15 we don't need a hard didn't
have a hard drive all ready to go yeah
that's a seat pick you okay yes I would
have to do 435
60 gigs for 15 his windows even get
Windows 10 even going to fit on that
look all the low trap on it I do budget
goes from here all the time but that
still puts us at 195 and we still need a
case and a power supply we have $5 $5
case and power supply combo I could get
you guys I like going to notice to keep
the power supply maybe with the point
you guys holding that thing out I'm
gonna be a star because I've asked for
that case for a while so you know if
it's music I can no one going to notice
you if you walk out your the power
supply okay what if we find a different
a different like bare-bones to start
from sure sure and then that'll give a
little because if we can find something
ATX with a decent power supply but as
far as as far as i7 is concerned that's
the chief Illinois was cheap so I'm
going to be able to get you can we do
can we start doing like CPU swaps and
swap on i-5 for an i7 and as long as
they're the same in socket like if you
could make a quick to play mix and match
up we can move fast if you chill up the
systems and say do a CPU swap i 530 470
oh wait maybe I did look at this one
maybe there was a reason though oh the
power supply was crappy but we could
work with that because we should they
could have a as long as there's a power
supply on the test bench and there's a
power supply in the system
hold on a second oh boy
where'd I put this okay five levels here
okay cool where was that one has a bio
support those please okay okay I'm
feeling I'm feeling okay right now HP /
looks cool do you think so it's shiny so
like this one the the desktops the lying
down flat one has a 37 78 so we were
going to take the chip from one of these
and put it in there and take that and
put it in here
that's what my boss don't trust my
judgement so yeah do you think okay
thank you your judgement is X I think
it's excellent to my judgment so uh you
know do whatever you gotta do because
we're happy you know what look we like
this one better right
I just thought the front looked cool
look cool okay I want no other reason
they're actually yes this one does look
a little roomier and this one therefore
was we wanted order like an 80
millimeter and could just walk away
right if we needed a fan I think we
should take this one okay thanks so much
you've been way too helpful in Michael
you have a ninety two millimeter fan by
chance for 90s you that's an ad that's
an IV that's a 92 but I can't take your
CPU to listen what kind of computer shop
is this anyway you don't have a 92
million fan I'm taking my business
elsewhere
no no no okay you call that last you
call that left we're not going anywhere
soft amazing boss yeah oh crap this fan
has a proprietary 4-pin connector on it
Oh what are the odds you have a
sacrificial Dead fan that I can splice a
standard connector onto so I don't ask
for much I know
if we're going to go with a 980 I mean
this would be probably the 980 okay let
me see if I've heard back from any of
our 980ti leads whoa 275 FTW 980ti
that's thank you for a few bucks to work
with a little power supply my priorities
we've got a 980ti
I mean let's try this but are you
weighing those four parts but looks like
it's a quick way to know what kind of
system I'm dealing with like how much
they spend on the heatsink and the power
supply like yeah and the you know the
overall build of the chassis it's an
indicator okay I'ma be all I'm going to
join you I'm going to waste it's not the
be-all and end-all obviously in a
wasting system okay well I'm going to
start digging out one that I found that
looks kind of promising here I don't
think we're going to find anything
better than what we have like honestly
that that that old workstation looked
kind of promising but I mean do you want
to go do you want to go full ghetto and
do two power supplies we can kind of
been done before but you got to do what
you got to do not effectively that's
true
Wow I mean is it because you're in the
Sun that you feel the need to throw so
much shade right now like I just could
be involved or you don't
I mean this is a vanquished opponent
we'll just drop in facts man this is a
banquet opponent and I mean you're
taking all your salt and you're rubbing
it right in the wound
dude what if we found a power supply in
that scrap heap if that $10 we'll see
something there that you like
I thought something that's like probably
not that far off this just the power
supply yeah that'll be times ten dollars
okay even though it was in the scrap
heap yeah oh my rat
I can still - perhaps but I got a bell -
you can sell papers yeah how many of
your body - five bucks five bucks for
the Dorada eat one from the front of the
7/7 one word stated if that fails we
don't know enough to buy flowers money
no you don't so that deals on the table
so that's a gamble sooner you sit on it
okay could we come back tomorrow and buy
a power supply for five bucks up Afghan
people yeah that's what I'm saying okay
we stood on that good the system though
because we needed services okay laughs
some power supplies on my own you guys
I'm getting a call beforehand I'm
getting bored you're a person sure yeah
that's different okay awesome okay but I
was allowed to swap these power supplies
okay okay so I'm going to do I know what
I'm gambling I'm going for the film will
take over the edge people okay I mean at
least it has PCI Express connectors and
what I've heard is that it's just a
range that you get so if we get lucky
then that might be all we need
I mean we're gambling no matter what we
do at this point yeah what we do well
whatever we do is going to be our risk
Thanks thank you
okay let's go dude but I'll take it
we're out of it I mean yes North
Hollywood okay so I'll just go Stalcup
straight to the point
we found one we haven't actually gone to
pick it up yet but it's a little far
away from us but we found one for 275 is
that is that close to what you were able
to charge for it or should we just go
get the other one
you could do it for 250
what kind of card is it is it a
reference or like a could I get the
exact model sorry it has a water courier
on it yeah
two-fifty North Hollywood ah let me let
me just up are you wanting to not it's a
980ti hold on a second we might we might
have ourselves a deal did you want to
get together today like very soon my
phone just died oh my goodness my power
just turn off Oh terrible
next week I'm scrapping our Wars okay so
what we have to know then though is I
see there's a little note in the box
when did you figure out who we were do
you think just talking about blatant
cheating now just wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
