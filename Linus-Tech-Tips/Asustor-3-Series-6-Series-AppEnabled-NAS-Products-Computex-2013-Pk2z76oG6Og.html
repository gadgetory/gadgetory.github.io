2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm we're at the a su store
booth here at computex 2013 and while
you might not be familiar with a su
store you're definitely familiar with
their parent company if you watch this
channel asus created this entirely new
subsidiary of their business in order to
address the very different needs that
storage users have compared to the kinds
of folks who buy performance graphics
cards say for example so here at the
show they're showing off the asuste or 3
series as well as the asuste or 6 series
so unique features of the 3 series
include an IR receiver which you can
clearly see right here on the tube a
version it's available in a tube a and 3
Bay version as well as check this out
there is an HDMI output on the back of
the unit that actually allows you to use
it with boxxy software they've got a
demo running to my right over here and
there a i remote app here we go as a
media player which is pretty freaking
cool and that's functionality that we
haven't seen in and as before speaking
of more functionality the 6 series which
is available in anywhere from a to drive
to an a drive configuration we've got
the two in the four right here actually
has expandable memory in addition to its
dual core processor so I see store
actually won a best choice award here at
computex 2013 for network attached
storage data storage devices and there's
a very very big reason for that come on
over here so expandability find you
expand your RAM find you expand your
connectivity now you can expand your
functionality on the device because you
might go I've had NASA's in the past and
I've never needed to expand my ram
because they only do what they do with
their app central concept of being able
to add functionality over time you can
add things such as their ftp explorer
which is available now there's about a
hundred apps available at this time as
well as their dropbox app to increase
functionality i'm going to show you one
of the apps that is on this ipad right
here it's called AI download and it's an
easy way to here we go
and access things like torrents set them
up for download without ever actually
interfacing through your computer now
speaking of interfacing through your
computer guys the software is in beta
right now so don't worry too much about
the language barrier if you're if you're
watching from another region but
speaking of not needing to use the
computer they've actually added a
spotlight search right here or
searchlight that allows you to find
things on the nas directly through the
web UI rather than relying on simply
navigating through the file explorer so
the demo search that they did for us was
music which brings up well music that is
stored on your nas server now speaking
of not necessarily needing access to
your desktop as well as improving
functionality a su store has added an
industry-first so this is a searchlight
type search functionality so it actually
gives you suggestions for your search
results as you go through the web UI
itself not even requiring you to use the
regular file explorer on your computer
this integrates nicely with their app
functionality as well as their mobile
concepts so you can use the AI master
app right here to actually access your
files as well as see the activity of
your nas and do things like backup and
restore it's available for iPad as well
as Android devices and when I say iPad I
mean iOS of course now as you guys know
we're here at the show powered by
Western Digital so it'd be a real shame
if I didn't tell you what would be the
optimal drives for these knives and
closures so anything from a 3-series two
or four Bay to a 6 series tour for Bay
is going to be a perfect pairing for a
WD red drive they have lower noise
characteristics as well as lower power
consumption compared to regular desktop
drives making them perfect for these
tight applications where they are going
to be sandwiched right up against each
other however the WD red is really
optimal for anywhere from a 125 baying
configuration so something like a 6
series 6 Bay or eight Bay which is also
available is going to be a better fit
for a WD se they just launched these at
the show their optimal for greater than
five drive configurations all the way up
to 24 drives are beyond because of their
enterprise grade heritage but they don't
cost nearly as much as a w dr e drive
does which
their raid edition drive so it makes for
a nice balance if you don't need the
ruggedness of an re but you need
something that is more resistant to
vibration from other drives because of a
larger multi drive configuration
compared to a WD red thanks for checking
out our coverage of the a su store booth
here at computex 2013 don't forget we
are powered by WD here as well as
