it this is recording so let's just
missed her okay alright so I'm here in
the trendnet suite at CES 2011 and
they've got a bunch of really cool
networking stuff on display so I want to
start with their 450 megabit per second
products so why don't we start on the
left and move our way over to the right
so most of these products are actually
brand-new and you can see the ones that
are flagged with a CES launch badge are
actually the ones that are launching
here at CES so this is pretty cool this
is actually a 450 megabit per second
version of their gaming adapter so that
allows you to have a high speed wireless
connection to not only a not only a
gaming console but really anything that
needs a network connection where you
can't actually run a dedicated wire so
here we have a concurrent dual band 450
megabit per second router you can see
that actually you're going to see over
the next little bit here that most of
trend that's new products are using a
very sleek glossy black sexy shell
design and this is a far cry from the
sort of blue that we used to see sort of
23 years ago so it's coming a long way
in terms of the industrial design which
is fairly obvious here we've got a 450
megabit per second access point this
one's not new and also this guy right
here is not new this was their their 450
megabit per second router they were
first to market with a 450 megabit per
second router so this product was a
little bit ahead of its time you can
actually buy it at NCIX it's already in
stock so there's nothing that new or a
noun see about this one this is another
thing that's not me this has been a
focus for trendnet over the last
actually a tes last year they were
talking a lot about green switches and
they've got a great demo here that
actually demonstrates we've got the
green switch which is right here with
the green stripe on it and this is the
blue I was talking about you they've got
one of their old switches and you can
see the power consumption is up to
seventy percent less with a green switch
versus with their older
power saving switches and not only that
but now we've actually got green
versions and you can see the greens
whoops hum breaking everything you can
see the green stripe here and the green
branding on the front of this but this
is actually a wireless-n home router so
we're able to reduce power consumption
by about half with a wireless n router
verse with a wireless and green router
versus with a wireless n non power
saving router and trend that's obviously
not all about switches and routers we've
got their IP cameras so we've got a few
products for that our new some that
aren't new and some that are like run
new because they're not even released
yet so let's check out this one first
we've got their TV IP 6 12 series of
cameras and I want to show you guys
exactly how smooth the recording is on
this particular camera it has a 10x
optical zoom it pens 330 degrees side to
side and tilts 115 degrees up and down
which is pretty outstanding this is a
wireless end camera although it is
plugged in via ethernet right now but if
you just want to point the camera at
that screen right well that's a little
big
show you guys how smooth the recording
is on this camera now there's also a
power over ethernet version of it which
is pretty much the same thing except p 0
e instead of wireless and moving down we
have some cameras here that are not
quite as new such as the key VIP 512 WN
which I do remember from last year at
CES now they have some new wireless end
cameras coming as well so these are more
consumer-oriented models you can see
these ones don't feature a remote
adjustment of where they're pointed at
although we do have infrared models as
well as some higher end ones that do
feature side to side as well as tilt
functionality and infrared lighting on
them as well that's also taking
powerline ethernet very very seriously
and they've launched recently their 500
megabit per second powerline AV Adapter
look here the box that's what it looks
like so 500 megabit per second is a
first on the market and a first for
trendnet in real world you're probably
looking at about 200 megabytes per
second and or true have 200 megabit per
second and change but the reality of it
is most powerline adapters are not going
to get anywhere near their rated
thorough put it's a limitation of the
technology and really that speed is more
than adequate for HD streaming and even
file transfers I've criticized powerline
a lot in the past for having great
latency so it's great for gaming but for
not having great thorough put well now
you can actually transfer large files
over it as well so I'm going to love
this way crazy we finally got some more
consumer products we have a few 3G
wireless n router so these are great if
you want to plug in for example a
tmobile stick and then share your
connection with other people i mean 3
g's not that fast so you're probably
looking at a limitation of sort of three
or four people using it at a time but it
could be handy if you're traveling like
with one other person you guys want to
share an internet connection in your
room and last but not least we have the
consumer level wireless stuff so we've
got a few wireless n home
routers 300 megabits per second
concurrent dual band router this is sort
of less exciting and this is what we
find at the back of the sweet as opposed
to the front of this week where we found
all the 400 megabit per second stuff but
this is still good too we've also got a
few little cool adapters don't so this
one is ultra compact this one is ultra
compact so these are both wireless I
believe these are both wireless n yeah
these are both wireless n and then
finally we have the world's smallest so
this is a I don't know I micro compact
whatever they want to call it it's less
than the size of an actual USB plug in
so that's pretty cool as well and oh
this one this one I'm really excited
about so this is the wireless end gaming
adapter remember I showed you guys the
450 megabit per second version over at
the front of the suite so this is the
older one and this one's going to be
coming down to a lower price point
remember it works with we Xbox and
Playstation but also pretty much
anything else that needs a network
connection but this this is the one
that's really exciting this is a cool
product so this has a built-in switch
okay and it is also a wireless and media
bridge so there are similar products on
the market for things like power line
where you have multiple ports on one
side and then you have a power line
connection running maybe to your main
router but this one actually runs off of
wireless n so this is really cool so
what trend that has to say for
themselves here is that it works with
network-enabled blu-ray players
televisions DVRs game consoles it'll
work with computers pretty much anything
that needs a connection to your network
and is not convenient to access via a
wired connection or via power line so
thank you for checking out my little
video about the products that are on
display in the trendnet sweet don't
