this is recording all right so I'm here
in the TRENDnet suite at CES 2011 and
they've got a bunch of really cool
networking stuff on display so I want to
start with their 450 megabit per second
products so why don't we start on the
left and move our way over to the right
so most of these products are actually
brand new and you can see the ones that
are flagged with a CES launch badge are
actually the ones that are launching
here at CES so this is pretty cool this
is actually a 450 megabit per second
version of their gaming adapter so that
allows you to have a high-speed wireless
connection to not only a not only a
gaming console but really anything that
needs a network connection where you
can't actually run a dedicated wire so
here we have a concurrent dual band 450
megabit per second router you can see
that actually you're going to see over
the next little bit here that most of
trend that's new products are using a
very sleek glossy black sexy shell
design and this is a far cry from the
sort of blue that we used to see third
of two three years ago so it's coming a
long way in terms of the industrial
design which is fairly obvious here
we've got a 450 megabit per second
access point this one's not new and also
this guy right here is not new this was
their their 450 megabit per second
router they were first to market with a
450 megabit per second router so this
product was a little bit ahead of its
time you can actually buy it at NCIX
it's already in stock so there's nothing
that new or announced see about this one
this has been a focus for TRENDnet over
the last actually a CES last year they
were talking a lot about green switches
and they've got a great demo here that
actually demonstrates we've got the
green switch which is right here with
the green stripe on it and this is the
blue I was talking about you they've got
one of their old switches and you can
see the power consumption is up to 70%
less with a green switch versus with
their older
non
power-saving switches and not only that
but now we've actually got green
versions and you can see the greens
whoops
um break and everything you can see the
green stripe here and the green branding
on the front of this but this is
actually a wireless and home router so
we're able to reduce power consumption
by about half with a wireless n router
verse with a wireless and green router
verses with a wireless n non power
saving router and trend that's obviously
not all of those switches and routers
we've got their IP cameras so we've got
a few products here that are new some
that aren't new and some that are like
run new because they're not even
released yet so let's check out this one
first we've got their TV IP 612 series
of cameras and I want to show you guys
exactly how smooth the recording is on
this particular camera it has a 10x
optical zoom it pens 330 degrees
side-to-side and tilts 115 degrees up
and down which is pretty outstanding
this is a wireless end camera although
it is plugged in via ethernet right now
but if you just want to point the
cameras that's right
the recording is on this camera now
there's also a power over ethernet
version of it which is pretty much the
same thing except Pio II instead of
wireless and moving down we have some
cameras here that are not quite as new
such as the TV IP 512 WN which I do
remember from last year at CES now they
have some new wireless end cameras
coming as well so these are more
consumer oriented models you can see
these ones don't feature remote
adjustment of where they're pointed at
although we do have infrared models as
well as some higher-end ones that do
feature side to side as well as tilt
functionality and infrared lighting on
them as well also taking powerline
Ethernet very very seriously and they've
launched recently their 500 megabit per
second powerline AV adapter here the box
that's what it looks like so 500 and
megabit per second is a first on the
market and a first for TRENDnet in real
world you're probably looking at about
200 megabytes per second and/or true
about 200 megabit per second and change
but the reality of it is most powerline
adapters are not going to get anywhere
near their rated throughput it's a
limitation of the technology and really
that speed is more than adequate for HD
streaming and even file transfers I've
criticized powerline a lot in the past
for having great latency so it's great
for gaming but for not having great
thorough put well now you can actually
transfer large files over it as well so
moving along this week we finally got
some more consumer products we have a
few 3G wireless n router so these are
great if you want to plug in for example
a t-mobile stick and then share your
connection with other people I mean 3G
is not that fast so you're probably
looking at a limitation of sort of three
or four people using it at a time but it
could be handy if you're traveling like
with one other person you guys want to
share an internet connection in your
room
and last but not least we have the
consumer level Wireless stuff so we've
got a few wireless n
routers 300 megabits per second
concurrent dual-band router this is sort
of less exciting and this is what we
find at the back of the suite as opposed
to the front of this week where we found
all the 400 megabits per second stuff
but this is still good - we've also got
a few little cool adapters don't so this
one is ultra compact this one is ultra
compact so these are both wireless I
believe these are both wireless n yeah
these are both Wireless N and then
finally we have the world's smallest so
this is a I don't know I micro compact
whatever they want to call it it's less
than the size of an actual USB plug in
so that's pretty cool as well and oh
this one this one I'm really excited
about so this is the wireless end gaming
adapter remember I showed you guys the
450 megabit per second version over at
the front of the suite so this is the
older one and this one's going to be
coming down to a lower price point
remember it works with Wii Xbox and
Playstation but also pretty much
anything else that needs a network
connection but this this is the one
that's really exciting this is a cool
product so this has a built-in switch
okay and it is also a wireless and media
bridge so there are similar products on
the market for things like powerline
where you have multiple ports on one
side and then you have a powerline
connection running maybe to your main
router but this one actually runs off of
wireless n so this is really cool so the
trend that has to say for themselves
here is that it works with network
enabled blu-ray players televisions DVRs
game consoles it'll work with computers
pretty much anything that needs a
connection to your network and is not
convenient to access via a wired
connection or via powerline so thank you
for checking out my little video about
the products that are on display in the
TRENDnet suite don't forget to subscribe
