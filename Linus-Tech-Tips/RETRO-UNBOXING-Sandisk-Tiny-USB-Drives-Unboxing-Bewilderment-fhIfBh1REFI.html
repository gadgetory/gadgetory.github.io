done in a long time a retro unboxing
this is the OCZ mega cart back in the
day this was priced at a whopping
145 dollars okay it has an unparalleled
high density design quick transfer rates
for files of all types and sizes true
plug-and-play functionality and it is
ultra slim thin enough to store in your
wallet yes my friends it also comes with
an incredibly stuck backing because it's
been sitting for so many years in a
warehouse there we go just go ahead and
pick that off yes my friends thin enough
that you could put it in your wallet if
your wallet was like massive so the way
that this actually plugs in is it has a
USB dongle that sits inside the cart
itself and comes out and like plugs into
your system because it needs this much
space to store the massive 8 gigs of
memory that it has ok
so the real subject of this video is
actually SanDisk's Cruiser force and
cruiser fit to show how far we've come
these are some pretty exceptional
products in that they are both available
in up to 64 gig capacities they have the
same USB 2 interface and probably better
performance than the mega cart and look
at the size of them so the banner
packaging is unbelievable okay so the
cruiser force has a durable metal casing
it has a clip that goes right onto your
keychain that actually is made of metal
so it's not going to break off like most
of the keychain clips on USB thumb
drives these days and it'll has their
secure access software that allows you
to keep your files private it is also
extremely small just small enough to fit
into a USB port with really no no space
other than that and it's 64 gigs the
next one is the cruiser fit which I am
also going to similarly extract from the
packaging it has the same SanDisk
software that we found on the last one
and it has similarly you know I actually
saw something advert
with frustration-free packaging not that
long ago I think everyone would do well
to adopt the frustration-free packaging
model this one doesn't have the same
metal casing but it is actually smaller
so it is basically the size of a USB
connector and then it actually comes
with a cap so that presumably it's a
little bit more difficult to lose and
then a tiny little a tiny little hoop
where you can put like a little string
on it and you could store it somewhere
this one again I would feel pretty good
about on my keychain because the little
hook is metal and because there's no
weight to this thing so I'm not
expecting it to get broken so that's
pretty much it guys I have a hundred and
twenty eight gigs of storage here and I
have eight gigs here and that is how far
we've come in the last few years thank
you for checking out my showcase of
SanDisk's Cruiser Series drives the fit

you disliked it leave a comment if you
are equally floored at like the sheer
insanity of all this and don't forget as
