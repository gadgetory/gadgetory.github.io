celebrities for the results of the
one-year airflow test yes my friends we
are still running them and we are doing
the video but there's only one small
problem Luke doesn't work here anymore
to do the stunning conclusion so we're
gonna have to walk all the way over to
floatplane media's office and get Luke
to help me check out which one worked or
if they'll didn't work
brought to you by tunnel bear tunnel
valve leaves the Internet should be more
open and private try it out for free at
tunnel bear comm /l tt will have that
linked below
I actually had very little involvement
in this project what is going on here
well there's any OD and in between II
like there was before OD has more fans
blowing out I think all the fans blowing
out any has all the fans blowing in and
in between E is fairly balanced they
have all been running for over a year
behind the old set yeah
but then we built this mezzanine that
we're standing in and then we tore down
that set so once the mezzanine was done
and before the set got torn down
they got moved up here to the office but
they were out in the warehouse under the
worst possible conditions literally
construction zone
let's not entirely dismiss the
possibility that we will learn something
today even if what we learn is that were
idiots and we don't know how to perform
a controlled experiment so which one is
supposed to be the worst by the
conventional wisdom I think most people
think that all in is the worst okay so
let's get the other ones no wait we
bleep no no all out is supposed to be
the worst but all in these are these are
the top and Packers this is supposed to
be the bad one all out and then it sucks
air into the crevices yes okay okay so
this is the one we start with so the
outside isn't really something to judge
because they would have all had a bunch
of dust settle on the top and it's not
that terrible I mean like I'm gonna do
one streak on the power supply I mean
it's not great not great having a look
at our fan though really makes me wonder
how it is that people get their
computers disgusting enough to be like
gummed up well how there's it there's
cobwebs that bottom filter was
definitely doing something and this is
OD this is OD so that means this one it
wasn't pulling through a filter he
should have been sucking all the air in
from elsewhere so this is another thing
we have to be careful with this this is
another thing where it's fairly
case-specific because a lot of cases
don't have that huge filtered mesh on
the bottom so you can also see here that
with the audi case we've actually got a
lot of dust build up here and you can
assume that for every bit of dust on
this
yeah more got pulled in yeah actually
this is a good thing they're both sort
of a good thing but it's a good thing to
see
so our graphics card does have a dust
bunny inside it yeah so that's some
buildup
so our CPU is good yeah so on the top
was good so it actually didn't suck that
much in because they're just blasting
everything else yes so the CPU is like
sheltered almost because everything
around it was like no get out yeah so
you can actually you can see some dust
streaks on these cable management holes
and then but not much I bet you the
graphics card was breathing through here
and through here
how explains clean because it's through
a filter actually that area of the
filter is pretty concentrated any dust
that's caught in this filter was already
in the computer okay interesting so
that's all pulled from inside and these
fans have a fair amount of buildup in
the matcha tea
I think the main takeaway with this one
is that even in a construction zone
where clearly there was a lot of dusty
buildup on top most of your dust is
coming into your case from the bottom so
if you put your computer on the ground
because we didn't have fans blowing out
of the bottom that's right yeah you
might have a bad time when do the other
extreme let's do the test is still bad
we're already learning something hold on
this is the one that is sucking
everything in this is everything in so
theoretically yeah this isn't gonna be
good either well no okay let's start
with the bottom okay interesting that's
weird
the power supply area doesn't have much
dust no it doesn't because the air is
blowing out of here getting filtered and
then being sucked into here there's two
fans like hold on there's one two three
four five fans worth of pressure going
out of here this effectively has a skirt
around oh yeah okay so there's dust on
this but it's not on the inside it's on
the top yeah it's definitely on the top
that's so weird okay power supply is
completely clean yeah
how interesting that is interesting see
we are learning things I did not see
this one coming
that is okay that's cooler than I
expected I will definitely give it that
well I want to see the Franco good it's
filtering stuff this is telling us that
this case is intake system is like not
that great because these are about as
dust this is the other one this stuff is
on the outside cuz that's pulling
through that makes sense oh just like
wow way when you did that like and it's
loose which is interesting
so our graphics card has no doubt that's
a little more than earlier than last
time
definitely more dust just lying CPU okay
there's also definitely more dust on the
back Ben C female office so GPU is a
little bit better but our supply is
better this case does not have filters
on the top of the back so you don't get
to experience so the main takeaway from
this one is that more airflow right
around an area is gonna give you a much
much higher concentration of dust and
that again poor planning is ultimately
what's gonna kill you yeah is the
graphics card better or worse on this
one
oh it's waivers way worse so the GPU
over there had to breathe in through
this which was very apparent yeah and it
breathed in junkie dusty yeah that's
right
this one is actually breathing good air
but that's the only piece and the tars
busting I wouldn't have thought that
having a filtered fan like blowing
towards the graphics card would affect
the movement of the air inside like the
currents inside enough to be the
difference okay so this is sort of the
like the recommended way so it's neither
one extreme nor the other most people
would go with a setup similar to this so
it's important to note that even though
we've actually got four fans pulling in
and two going out the ones coming in are
filtered so these filtered ones coming
in should have much less airflow than
the non-filtered ones going out so right
off the bat our CPU is pretty good I
would say almost us Wow
almost as good but not quite there is
still no not quite at all there's
definitely still noticeable dust and
that one was like actually clean so this
one what's interesting is that even
though it's using a poor method of
keeping dust out of your system what it
does do is it focuses all the dusts that
it does pull in on the bottom and then
sucked it all through that filter for
this particular case and here a bit yeah
and it's gonna change with every case
okay should we have a look at the
filters yeah okay so as expected this
one doesn't have an air curtain around
it so the power supply does draw air
through the filter filter didn't even
stop everything don't filter didn't stop
everything at all and there's a lot of
customers this is easily the most
concentrated wow there's like hairs
there's like strands oh okay there's a
little bit of that on any yeah that
makes sense because these are pulling in
right yeah yeah and like it plumed okay
so that's as expected so no dust bunny
in the GPU CPU fan mostly cleared this
one had more fans and got slightly more
total dust which kind of makes sense and
the filters are slightly more clogged
which makes sense but overall I'd say
it's probably more balanced the CPU got
hit but not as hard as it did on the
really bad CPU case
yeah but not as good as it did the other
time as well that much is this one yeah
the in turn so it ended up being in
between which it's kind of what we were
aiming for we just didn't know is
actually gonna work that way
here you go then the main takeaways are
on your intake fans you want to have
filtered air to the greatest degree
possible and the more air flow you have
the more dusty buildup you are
ultimately going to have yeah I think a
balanced approach is good but you're
gonna have to think about your
particular case your particular
like if you're on the floor then one of
the big things we learned is you want a
bunch of exhaust on the floor yeah to
keep dust away from your system it
actually works yeah yeah and then the
other big takeaway is that fresh books
is the small business accounting
solution for well small business owners
and freelancers so whether you're
running a plumbing business or you're
running a house-painting business or
dust management doing cleaning people's
computers for them for a few bucks on
the side which by the way can be very
lucrative freshbooks helps you stay more

LTT we're gonna have that linked below
just enter Linus tech tips and the how
did you hear about us section so that
was actually more enlightening than I
thought I'm surprised I thought they
were just all gonna be butchered because
of the construction zone so guys if you
just like this video then like come on
we finally did it you were all asking
for it but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured we've
got our merch store linked in the video
description and our community forum
which you should totally join for those
of you going hey Luke's back where did
Luke go he's working on floatplane yeah
clean win-win is this video coming out
there might be the Alpha yeah or not see
ya bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
