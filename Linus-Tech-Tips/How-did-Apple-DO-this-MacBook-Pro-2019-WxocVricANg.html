the same design as the 2016 we've got
the same slim aluminum unibody chassis
the same 2880 by 1800 Retina display the
same massive force touch trackpad the
same love it or hated touch bar and
those same for Thunderbolt three ports
that gave us the nickname dongle book
pro this on the other hand is my macbook
pro i bought it back in 2011 and it's
been my daily driver ever since its
obsolete now but I haven't really had a
reason to upgrade because most of the
improvements to date have come at some
costs expandability thermal performance
speed even the keyboards reliability and
this generation looks no different but
let me tell you books can be deceiving

what's different about the 2019 MacBook
Pro then well we'll get into the one
engineering change that actually
surprised even me and actually matters
but first the change nobody is surprised
about and didn't matter the keyboard
this is Apple's third design iteration
on their low profile butterfly switches
in an attempt to keep dust and debris
from breaking the stupid thing but even
Apple admits it's not trustworthy
because the 2019 MacBook Pro was
actually listed in the keyboard service
program the day it dropped that's when
you know it's bad to me the keys
themselves feel a little bit more spongy
and this isn't a bad thing because it
makes the travel feel a bit more
pleasant and deeper than it otherwise
might it's a very subtle effect though
and it might just be my mind playing
tricks on me all I know is I've never
been a fan of the feel of the butterfly
switches and I found typing on this one
touch more pleasant overall but now it's
time to dig a little deeper because
while our MacBook Pro 2019 may not be
equipped with the best factory GPU
options as it's better for a number of
reasons to use an e GPU it is equipped
with the highest end CPU Apple offers
the 8 core 16 thread core I nine
ninety-nine a th K which has a claim to
boost of up to five gigahertz and a base
cloth barely lower than its six core
predecessor actually before I move on I
just want to talk for a second about
these boost clocks because they're not
boost clocks as we know them they're
actually what Intel calls thermal
velocity boost TLDR what these numbers
represent are boost clocks on top of
boost clocks only achievable under
extremely strict thermal and power
criteria only while normal boost is
active and only on a single core so when
you're doing actual work
you'll probably never see the advertised
numbers to be clear Apple isn't to blame
for intel's marketing spin and they
aren't the only ones who are advertising
their computers this way but I'd really
rather laptops be graded based on the
frequencies they can actually hit rather
than what's on Intel's Ark website but I
digress coming back to the MacBook
I was skeptical about its performance
because it has more faster cores than
the 2018 model but it has the same TDP
and that model is famous for thermal
throttling to the point where we even
expressed concern over its longevity and
long term data integrity
due to its reliance on the t2 security
chip which is still present here so I
wanted to test it against the 2018 but I
also wanted to see how it would compare
to a similarly SPECT PC as many have
claimed the same chip in a different
form factor would perform better and in
fact we've shown that a MacBook can
attain higher performance by placing an
energy chiller box unfortunately there
are no pcs with this exact chip right
now but I did find the ROG Strix car 3
rocking the quote 4.8 gigahertz core I
998 ATH well that's supposedly a touch
slower the scar has a much better cooler
so it should boost for longer and
throttle later if at all compared to the
MacBook but here's what surprised me
thermals actually look better than 2018
that's a good 6 degrees cooler than last
year's model and supposedly we're
looking at CPUs with the same TDP here
clearly they're just throttling right
nope check this out under a full prime95
small FFT workload the 2019 model is
sitting pretty at 2.6 gigahertz nowhere
near it's all core boost at 4.2 but
still higher than its base clock and
faster than both the 2018 MacBook Pro
and the SCAR 3 can maintain even with
his limiters off what okay did they
change the cooler or something no so I
reached out to Apple to find out how
they did it but as usual they took one
look at the email and sent it straight
to the trash but I have my own theory
one I think they've upgraded the thermal
interface material between the cooler
and the chips and two I think they
pulled off some pretty heavy under
bolting in Mac OS I'm sure enough when I
fire up the same workload under windows
in boot camp we get much higher
temperatures overall and we end up
thermal throttling well below base clock
after only about a minute so at least
one part of my theory is confirmed but
you don't buy a Lambo
commuting and you don't buy a Mac your
own windows on it so I guess I can give
them a pass here just bear in mind as we
move on that bootcamp performance will
be a lot lower than Mac OS due to the
under bolting alone speaking of things
you don't buy a Mac for gaming at 1440
by 900 our MacBook Pros Radeon Pro 560 X
doesn't fare too well but we get decent
results in cs:go compared to the same
GPU on our 2018 model so that's
something more importantly though when
we move on to productivity holy crap is
that Cinebench score a 900 point gain
over 2018 from for extra threats
that's nearly a 30% uplift and right on
with the better cool scar Geekbench has
a straight up murdering the scar in Mac
OS with the obvious exception of the GPU
but it's also worth noting the extra
oomph of the 20-19 muddles GPU gains
over last year even though it's the same
GPU hinting at that better Tim blender
meanwhile sees a 35 to 40 percent
improvement in performance with the 2019
even beating the scar and shaving a
whole six minutes off the classroom test
over the 2018 MacBook Pro the v-ray
gives us a slightly more modest but
still respectable improvement over all
right in line with the scar 3 and
finally luxe mark gives us more of that
delicious GPU performance uplift we've
been seeing so much of content creators
will be happy to know that Adobe
Premiere also gets an improvement over
the 2018 and Final Cut Pro 10 gets a
bump to saving nearly a minute and
render time over 2018 finally for you
Deb's out there are Mozilla Firefox
compiled tests the 2019 is dominating
here to saving nearly 9 minutes over the
2018 model and whether it's because of
the tool chain or the more aggressive
clocks and Mac OS nearly as much over
the SCAR 3 now to be clear there would
be a significant performance uplift with
a better cooler but a MacBook is a
complete package that doesn't change
very often and I really can't overstate
how impressive these results are given
the thermal performance of the previous
generation I'd personally prefer a lower
thermal target with some Headroom built
in to let it turbo up a little bit more
but we're far from sustaining a hundred
degrees like last gen did we've said
before that Apple has some good
engineers over there and I think they've
earned their pay the
time around as for whether or not it's
going to replace my 2011 well let's just
say it's a strong contender and you know
what else is a strong contender the mass
drop control keyboard features a solid
cnc aluminum frame a built-in switch
plate RGB lighting qmk firmware for easy
customizability hot swappable key
switches with support for Cherry MX
chi-wah or halo switches a floating key
design dual USB type-c connectors and a
whopping 964 gram weight check it out
today at drop comm we're gonna have that
