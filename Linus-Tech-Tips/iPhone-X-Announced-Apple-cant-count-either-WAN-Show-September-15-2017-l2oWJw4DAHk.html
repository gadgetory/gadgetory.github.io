your weekly analysis and news and ah Who
am I kidding
we just goof around on Friday afternoons
and for some reason you guys like to
watch because you're weird like that I
like to watch yeah who doesn't
we've got a lot of great topics for you
guys today
but rather than tell you about them I'm
gonna pick all the most boring ones so
that I can raz James about it in person
how to make the news man okay this
headline weird case from Kickstarter
that Linus likes okay
first and foremost just cuz I like
something that doesn't make it weird
just I like to watch it I like to watch
for example you like to watch - is it
weird that if we both like it well no I
don't like this case that's why it's
weird it's weird that you like it I
think I didn't get it maybe you can walk
us through you can show everyone the
case you can tell us why all right I
don't think it's that weird I think some
of you guys okay I don't think all of
you guys are gonna want to pay for it
because that's a whole other matter but
I do think you guys will think it's
pretty cool what else we've got have we
got four boring news this week scroll at
the bottom usually put the boring stuff
on the bottom I don't know this is
pretty boring Bluetooth hacked again
it's scary it's scary but in like a
boring way like Bluetooth has to be the
most mundane boring thing on the face of
the earth the boringest and cool name
ratio is high though okay this is a
pretty good name Oh
Facebook to open a new AI loud and vote
rule oh oh you like the Canadian stuff
Oh Google Chrome lets you mute site okay
that's pretty cool okay that that's
pretty cool that one's at the very
bottom you don't even know what good
news is that's for last best but that's
not what you said proven is live baby
there's five
all right fine you pick two things that
cool ones okay this is probably one that
you normally wouldn't even read but it's
possible that in the near future you
might be able to charge your electric
car in five minutes I can charge my
electric car in five minutes now you
have a light it's a little one like this
what I'll see God hit me again that was
terrible there's gonna be a new gtx 1070
okay you know what I think my attempts
to read boring news are still more
interesting than your attempts to read
what you think is the best news
this is where we have a disconnect James
every week Linus puts in to the document
before I get to it his picks of things
that pop up out to him during the week
they pop out he puts them to make sure
they're in the show the top one this
week the fact that the that the video
card guy left AMD that is sort of a big
deal
he just went he's taking one quarter off
he's taking a long Christmas break yeah
back in January he's gonna be out for
three months okay okay this is so over
let me put let me put it this way uh you
know what fine we'll come back to this
after the break first the intro yes the
answer that questions yes
no there's music right now no they can
hear us still they can it's just
annoying
don't do that you're too new to the show
to be annoying see Luke gets away with
it I like to test the boundaries do you
like to watch other people test their
boundaries hmm are we allowed to talk
about stuff like this well we put the
sponsor logos on the screen
synergy all right okay you pick no we're
going we're going right into the radion
technologies group thing okay so I'm
gonna open up with I completely disagree
with you and then I'm gonna let you go
ahead and make your argue but you know
I'm gonna open up with what the actual
news is so the original article here was
actually from yong yong kang posted it
on the forum here we'll go ahead and
pull that up and basically just said
well that's all Raja
so you might remember him as tiger in
Aladdin the know you might remember him
as the gentleman who dropped the Rx for
80 back when it launched
that wasn't me I was just present he was
the one who dropped it that's where you
caught it from and he came back to AMD
right around the time that they launched
their Hawaii GPUs so that was the 290 X
and the 290 and Vega has basically been
his baby since then and he is going on a
break until the end of q4 so the start
of 2018 and dr. Lisa sue CEO of AMD so
she's so he's been running radio
technologies group which was split off
from AMD proper so they're gone okay
this is a CPU side this is the GPU side
in an attempt to make it easier for the
CPU side of things to work with folks
like Nvidia and the GPU side of things
to work with folks like Intel okay I'm
starting to get this
so dr. sue
it's basically stepping in as now the
boss and I don't I'd I'll just say boss
because I don't technically she was
already the CEO of it so you can't get
more boss than that but she'll be more
directly overseeing radion technologies
group blurring the line between these
two companies in my mind anyway in a way
and also what's it called when you go
like this telegraphing sort of a
telegraphing an attack you know Oh got
it
yeah so telegraphing sort of uh in my
mind potential shift in at least her
thoughts for how important Raja is to
our TG see I think you're reaching there
okay all right make your make your
argument so he don't let me stop you
from making your argument but uh okay
all right so he worked really hard
during bag up needless to say the guy
was probably burning the midnight oil
for months literally a couple of years
so he sent an internal email to the
staff
yeah thanking everyone for their hard
work highlighting how kick-ass the
launch has been for epic and well not
epic my thread Ripper and risin and all
of it and Vega since that's his his baby
so he thanked everyone for their hard
work and then said quote Vega was
personally hard on me as well and I used
up a lot of family credits during this
journey I decided to take a time off
they can see it they can see I'm sharing
them but they like when I read stuff so
it was tough on him he's taking some
time off I don't think that's hard to
understand so he asked sue when he
should take that when he should take
time off and she suggested this last
quarter I think he originally wanted to
go off like in January but there's more
product launches then so they chose to
chose now so I think your theory about
how her influence or presence is gonna
muddy the water I don't think that
really applies I think it's a quiet time
she's not gonna have to make that many
big decisions
I don't think okay coasting I don't
think there's ever a quiet time in the
tech industry for one thing
here's my counter argument to that if I
told you that it was in any way
acceptable for you to be off work for
three months unless there was I mean and
here's the thing you know we don't know
about his health or his family's health
or you know there may be personal
factors at play so that may be part of
why people are reading too much into
this because they don't have all the
information but all I can go based on is
what I see in front of me and what I see
in front of me is if I told you James
that barring any kind of health issues
or any kind of family emergency or the
birth of a child
it was cool for you to just not be at
work for a few months how essential
would you feel and how essential would I
have to feel like you are to just be
like yeah that's cool you know actually
you know would be great is if maybe for
the next few months maybe we just didn't
pay you and you just didn't come to work
and then maybe after that you'll come
back and you know like to me this feels
more like a slow like out like a a way
to to quietly phase out then it feels
like a sabbatical I could be totally
wrong I could be so far off the mark
that it's not even funny because a lot
of what's in here on the face of it
looks fairly credible you know he's been
working real hard and his family
probably wants to see him and this has
been a very long couple too few years of
his life but so why no successor then
because I don't think Raja is that
simple to introduce a successor to and I
think this few months gives them time to
find somebody
okay that's my tinfoil hat conspiracy
theory and I would be singing a totally
different song right now if Vega had
absolutely kicked ass hmm that bixby
talking to me huh nope not Bixby
might have been see really fix me but
it's for me might have been see
reactivating each other it was neither
yeah yeah that would be a great video
Bixby would be eloquent serious big yeah
oh wow that would be an amazing video
like getting them getting them going
like seeing if they could start
activating each other like like that I'm
sorry I don't understand could you
repeat that like that like that prank
call when you get one around a hotline
to talk to the other erotic hotline and
then it takes them like 10 minutes to
figure out like no you called me you
never know I've never heard of that oh
that sounds great though if for someone
who likes to watch I assume you like to
listen I should look it up behind vs.
pizza man that kind of thing that does
sound pretty good
okay so then tinfoil hat how many
tinfoil hats out of 10 am i doing it no
are we doing a strawpoll that's all
you're saying no no I want to hear from
you I actually do care what you think uh
he'll be back he'll be back I'm giving
you a credible six a six okay like it's
not that far-fetched okay it would be
true but I'm just erring on the side of
not true okay alright alright I can
accept that because I lied I don't care
what you think anyway good thoughts you
only think good I don't I don't think
goods don't think good thoughts all
right let's get into our next topic here
my you know I got really next door is
this I'm gonna have to owe everyone want
to know all right want to talk about the
iPhones iPhones wait
is this seriously all okay so there's a
couple issues here number one is I'm
working on my review of the 4k blade and
I'm gonna screen share you guys on
something
I've never seen before this is just this
is just my chrome right now mmm
this is not very usable it's white
privilege that's it that's not this is
not very helpful and and this this is
the other issue this is all the notes I
get you watched the event
I don't you you know you know what
you're gonna say I don't memorize every
suit you're gonna see summary you have
things to say you want to say them new
information no I don't remember how many
megapixels every every camera 12 there's
still 12 that hasn't even changed okay
well I didn't remember that so that's
why you got me what new Luke I wasn't
going to host the show with you I was
gonna host it with someone cool but then
we ran out of time saying I am NOT cool
I know are you implying that I'm hot
what oh you're making me very
uncomfortable right now hmm
okay oh okay so this is interesting
um do you are you familiar with this
Senator in particular you recognize that
name Al Franken yes he's the coolest
senator I think he's the guy that rakes
people over the coals questions them
hard questions he's got some more no
this is I this actually looks pretty
good okay so it's to do with their face
ID but anyway let's let's talk about see
I know I don't have a summary I don't
have like oh okay next time I do need
the summary for stuff like this just cuz
I watched the live stream doesn't mean I
don't need this every yeah I'm flying
blind here okay so let's talk general
impressions I don't know how many of you
did tune in to the live stream that we
did during Apple's event but ed and I
actually streamed live the whole time to
give you guys sort of a PC / Apple
fanboy perspective on all of the news
that they announced the watch looks
moderately interesting they are taking
another step towards the direction that
I didn't really want to see them go with
the Apple watch I mean independence
I like okay ah see it's not that I don't
like it it's that I think it's a lower
priority then then always on display so
every generation they're cramming in
more sensors this time they're cramming
in a sim card less sim so you can have a
cellular connection without needing to
actually put a sim card in it which is
really cool and I would be floored if we
don't see the same technology in every
phone moving forward at some point here
and the thing that's messed about that
is that's two devices running off the
same SIM card Glennis that never happens
like you can make calls from the phone
and then you've got yourself no you
still use so it's an independent
activation with the carrier so it has a
sim card it's just built into the PCB
but it's the same phone number
oh wait okay that I hadn't thought about
that
that's really cool anyway so love the
tech love the idea of not having to take
your phone with you or like even take it
out all day if you don't do a ton of
texting if you just need to like set
yourself a reminder take a call when
people call you actually you can place
calls from it you can do a lot of stuff
I just I hate that we aren't making it a
watch first
before it's a computer on your wrist and
I feel like every time they have an
opportunity to throw a marginally bigger
battery in it or to not put something
extra in throw a slightly more power
efficient processor in it and turn on
all these on display they don't they
just make it why do you want that more
advanced because I don't want to have to
go like this every time I want to know
the time I'm gonna be able to like just
see what time it you want to just look
down without even having to turn their
watch yeah I mean you're you wear a
watch when you watch right now yeah
people can't see it but like so let's
say I'm like this
Jesus you want to just be able to look
at it you don't even want to have to
tweak it no even that what do you know
what's just the littlest week that's
stupid
what if I'm okay you know okay here's
something yeah but the other side of
that coin is having it on
time for no reason stupid no it's not
stupid
what if it was dimly on and then tweaked
it here you would shine funny what let's
say I didn't have a computer in front of
me right now I'm sitting having a
conversation with someone at the table I
want to know what time it is this phone
with it's always on display is a
timepiece right there boom convenient so
convenient I don't have to pick it up
and go like this because really here's
the issue
it does time almost no better than a
phone okay I have to do the exact same
stupid routine to check the time on my
phone as I do on my watch and they're so
concerned about making it call phones
and browse the internet and track all of
my running and walking and swimming and
jumping and breathing and heart rate
that it did can't like that's so
reasonable for them to do that though
because the biggest criticism with the
watch is that it doesn't do anything so
they want to put more things in it for
it to do is that even the biggest
criticism of a watch like it is for me
who is well yeah but you wear an analog
watch you I would have created your own
biggest complaint why don't you get a
Casio calculator watch then if you
wanted to do something bunch a small you
can take boobies on it this new probably
probably right new blister I'd actually
the secret so I don't even know how to
tell time on this thing what's the
secret watches I don't know what this
means it's two lines down two lines down
a clock I get to go home you know okay
I'll confess that reading analog time is
not my forte either I'm really slow at
it with your counting by 5's I'm sure
and I'm super slow at it like I can
obviously I can do it but it takes me a
bit Sephora muscle memory it's it's and
you know what it's funny because I think
I
probably not the only one like you
remember it wasn't that long ago windows
had an analog clock when you click the
oh that's funny we're in the way there
we go
had an analog clock when you click to
the time in the bottom right corner no
thank you
whereas now they went digital with it
because I think this is just a skill
like driving manual that's fading from
our collective hmm what but you could
Lee could learn as a toddler to read
that way earlier than I analog watch
there's no secret to it if you know what
the number looks like then you know how
to say just say it about yes or no I can
read to okay no time is a little bit
complicated for little kids as someone
who has a little kid and has so men so
here you man explain me I used to be a
little kid I know how it goes
dad's playing hey I'm just joking go
ahead please the word mansplaining is
banned from the LAN show as of this
moment because there's two men talking
so it's no that's not why it's been it's
banned because it's ridiculous um okay
so you know you explained to me that
it's okay dad splaining that's things
allowed no it's not all dad's so so I
was going through this with my son and
he goes I said okay we've got to be at
school or somewhere I forget where I was
talking about but we've got to be there
at at 8:50 and he goes oh okay so but we
have the half of the rest of the hour
until 9:00 or something weighs versus 12
days yeah he figured we were using like
a base-10 system for time and I kind of
went oh no okay actually not so so there
are things about time that are
complicated even if you're looking at
the numbers but I'm just talking with
the reading of it I feel like we've
gotten off topic a little bit here so
bezel this displays the Apple watch we
want to talk about that I'm not excited
about because it doesn't have an
always-on display and Apple can sell me
another watch like you know SOS with
just your watch it's pretty cool not
needing to be able to get at your phone
or even have it with you all cool stuff
but I'm not buying another one until
they give me an always-on display okay
all right what's the next what's the
next product that they had what did I
mean did they update Safari or something
let's just get a meat and potatoes um no
no no hold on what oh right
Apple's new headquarters this is big
design the design looks great I thought
the keynote from the Steve Jobs theater
was absolutely gorgeous also have you
seen their new stores the town centre
center Town Hall or what was it town
town center okay we're not you know what
forget it let's just not talk we're not
gonna talk about from the way we're not
gonna talk about the iPhone at all let's
talk about the new concept for Apple's
retail store and sorry I almost called
it a store it's not a store it is a town
center because this is gonna be a place
where people go to gather and teach each
other and learn from each other and
interact that's right we're where
they're actually Apple is bringing it
full circle
okay they took us interaction they took
us from talking to each other like this
to talking to each other like this when
we're in the same room that's not how
you use a phone and now they're bringing
us back to talking like this about this
are you sure they are yeah that's what
it's all about it doesn't matter you
know how many bezels are on it we just
want to connect with each other and that
that is what Apple is enabling that's
malarkey for the uninitiated this is
what's happening they are at least
internally calling their stores the
Apple Store is now called up oh man
twitch twitch chats like line is stopped
yeah awesome oh stop your Town Square
town square sorry whatever it's a small
question
yes chin the fast do they expect the
public to refer to them that way I would
say keep dreaming but the Apple people
have people man I mean they'll do it
they're gonna do you can get them to
call it a Magic Mouse if you can get
them to call something a Magic Mouse
then I think you can get I want to
someone who has a bad experience me mad
about it and still call it that way
so I went to the Apple town square today
and the geniuses there totally sucked so
they had to call the mayor because he's
the only one that knows what's going on
I assume it goes all the way and the
manager is called the mayor now maybe
yeah
and every day's on me says can you stop
mansplaining right now what a winner
okay I like that I like that that's
pretty good Apple town mayor hey mayor
yes
okay okay fine so that was your first
question the answer honestly I'm
actually gonna go with no I don't think
anyone is gonna start calling it like
you can get people to call it Apple
Store because that's what it is yep it's
a store where you buy apples no wait
it's not they can do anything
second question are they gonna change
the sign okay so I actually didn't look
that closely at the designs for these
but if I had to guess like I don't even
think here hold on a second Apple town
Town Square here we go let's let's get
some images up here because if I had to
guess I would say they probably would
just have an Apple logo yes yeah so look
yeah I think I think that's where that's
a rectangle okay no no oh shut up
I'm not even if you stand on the corner
this this Town Square here just has like
an Apple logo this is clearly an
exceptional example that's outdoor it's
literally a Plaza
no that's like the idea though but Apple
stores are in malls that's true but I
think the idea behind some of these town
squares is that they're actually like
acquiring like what was this building
that they said I think they said they
bought like some historic building and
like Italy or some crap like this thing
they're gonna have their flagship stores
yeah see but but here it doesn't say
Apple store it's just an Apple logo
but they are changing the design of the
retail space to facilitate some kind of
human interaction yeah and they're
planning to bring in actual experts on
things although they were saying that
this new position they've created like
creative something will be to creatives
what the genius is to whatever and I'm
kind of like well that's a genius then
like if we're creating an analog for
geniuses then my expectations are fairly
low
apparently it was in France buzlar
Europe somewhere why don't we go with
that okay so what was your second
question I don't remember I was a sign
yeah are they actually expecting people
to talk to each other in there cuz you
don't you go in there and you look at
the Apple stuff that you want to look at
and you still don't talk to other humans
who are just shopping in there well here
so here's a question though you're
explaining your Apple shopper splaining
right now because I don't think you've
ever actually walked into an Apple store
and bought something
oh except for that time that you wanted
to get a red eye phone to make a video
and I went to the mall and I was the one
who bought that rad iPhone and brought
it back to the office yeah but you
didn't buy it okay I didn't go through
like the shopping you hand it over
company money to walk out of the store
with something for company use in and
out in two minutes
yes so as someone who is not cult of
Apple
can you really cult of Apple splain to
people who are Apple shoppers so like
normal cult of Apple people they go in
there they rub shoulders be like a
collective boner giddiness about how
sweet Apple isn't they kind of like they
experience the process and look up each
other eyes me know like are you seeing
this is so sec is that the idea here I
don't know actually I'm not much of an
Apple shopper either so you don't need
someone apples okay alright let's let's
let's stop with the let's stop with the
blue balls we'll talk about the phone
iPhone eight shockingly iterative to me
reminisce you can tell I don't
understand why they called it eight
the only reason that I can think of is
that this is a gradual phase-out of
having because right now they've got
what they've got
I see which isn't numbered at all right
then they've got the iPhone number then
they've got the iPhone we skipped a
number and it's ten now for some reason
because 10th anniversary and it's not a
numeral so if I had to guess well they
called it 10 now it's yeah yeah but it's
a Roman numeral 10 yes not like a a10 so
it's clearly separate so if I had to
guess what they're doing is they are
changing the lineup so that the regular
numbers are just going to be the
replacement for what a Nessie would have
been and we're gonna get no 8s we're
just gonna get a 9 and we're gonna be
using that same body design that we've
had since the six we're gonna be using
that like kind of for a bit on the value
option yeah okay and then that gives
them one more generation to kind of get
people used to this idea and it buys
them then two full years for OLED panels
to get more reasonable so that they can
bring the X X I and twelve like like
physical this more premium design so
they can bring that into the kinds of
price points that they want for their
step down so the whole lineup is going
to look like X I and then last gen X so
that'll be your top of the line and then
your step down and then you're gonna
have the kind of the cheapo line is
gonna be the nine and like the SE or
something like that I'll call it nine
III think maybe give it a new name just
like Suz yeah or they might do away with
numbers entirely and so they might have
like an SE and then like something else
entirely and basically I think they're
starting over at X or not line
extensions huge the or get this before
we go into our sponsor spots for the day
I have one more theory bomb to drop on
you Oh what am I gonna do you know how
oh s ten has just been OS ten forever
yeah what if this is just I phone 10
forever because Apple is responsible for
this naming BS that seems to have taken
the technology industry where they just
call the product the same thing they did
last year and the fact that it is so
confusing for consumers don't worry
about it we're just gonna do it what if
it's just I phone X I don't think that's
gonna be the case because on the iPhone
they still haven't done it
they still haven't gone notice because
the name Mac they are the masters of
making you want the newest thing every
year
you don't need an X right now if you
have a seven but you fucking want one
don't you
or do we drop f-bombs no no we don't
sorry everyone

not painful
all right so barring okay yeah you got
some perspiration action going on there
I will admit that I'm doing some mind
over matter wim HOF stuff here but like
it's pretty you got your eyes are watery
a little bit more watery than before
they're little glassy err synergy it's
spicy
is it spicy that's a spicy jerky I've
had synergy is a software download that
solves the problem of having two
keyboards and two mice once and for all
you can share one Mouse and one keyboard
between two or more come
Computers so you'll no longer confuse
which one is for which and I think the
coolest thing about it is that it works
cross-platform Windows Mac even Linux
you can seamlessly move your mouse
across the screens they've got great
options good options great features like
clipboard sharing between the computers
drag and dropping files the ability to
set up hotkeys out of sweet and more and
they offer a basic and pro option with a
one-time payment for lifetime access so
head over to seamless calm / synergy
slash line is 29 wow what a terrible
vanity URL and you can save fifty
percent so it's worth typing in all that
nonsense in order to get a great deal on
a great piece of size I told you you
were when they became a sponsor no I'm
not that old
alright ok I got all right I got to give
you props for holding up that well to
the reaper jerk it's worse now it's
worse now than it's been I'm suffering
now it gets you oh let me tell you the
suffering is oh well I'm aware
now I've diary everyday anyway can we
talk about the Nvidia the rumor now
they're working on oh no I'm not done
with the iPhone 8 yet oh we haven't even
talked about the X or 10 rather I want
to talk about it's better ok so the 8 is
super iterative whatever it's got
slightly better kind of everything the
10 I hate the speaker and face face
detection face ID cut out what's the
thinker that's that cut out at the top
oh that thing I don't mind that when
you're watching videos on that though
come on
have you seen have you seen what it
looks like when you're watching a video
on it yeah it's got like a little cutout
yeah I don't mind it it's horrible I
mean I might get used to it really fast
in my review I might be like you know
what this is fine it's totally cool
forget it but I love touch ID I'm
actually super the opposite of Stokes
that we're getting rid of touch ID
agreed
I think that getting into getting into
where's the where's that article that
you brought up
Thanks Bixby Bixby is activated right
now trying to help where the Bears
where's that article that you brought up
Thanks Bixby Bixby's activated right now
that we're getting into where there's
where's that article that you brought up
thanks Bixby Bixby's actor James Brown
Eugene that we're getting to where those
worse that article that you brought
everyone here to give James a raise
they're working that you brought up time
to give James raise actually we need to
unlock the phone geez I'm right
alright Bixby's with you okay so where's
that okay
so aside from okay so they claim face ID
is more secure but senator Al Franken
has actually questioned Apple about the
security of their face ID and has raised
some fairly interesting points here
namely sir Apple has stated that all
face print data will be stored locally
on an individual's device as opposed to
being sent to the cloud so is it
currently possible either remotely or
through physical access to the device
for either Apple or a third party to
extract and obtain usable face print
data from the iPhone 10 is there any
foreseeable reason why Apple would
decide to begin storing such data
remotely Apple has stated it used more
than 1 billion images in developing the
face ID algorithm where did these 1
billion face images come from it's less
relevant to me really you don't think
that's interesting it could be but the
answer could be very mundane it could be
shutterstock it could be just public
images of face why would you get a
billion images of faces the internet oh
yeah whole internet yeah but then how
would you guarantee that you have the
rights to use it because the whole Terms
of Service where you can collect
non-personally identifying information
the thing that people like usually agree
to is that it's not supposed to be
personally identifying your face is by
definition personally identifying
what steps did Apple take to ensure its
system was trained on a diverse set of
faces in terms of race gender and age
how are they protecting its racial
gender or age bias in face ID in the
unveiling of the iPhone 10 Apple made
numerous assurances about the accuracy
and sophistication please describe again
all the steps that a plan can work to
ensure that face ID can distinguish an
individual's face from a photograph or
mask for example I would love did you
know that maybe like a death mask and
then like I don't know exactly how we do
it I would love to have a Linus mask
don't I got we make one for the video
okay no you can't have it no that is so
weird
drop all if we made on merit all you
watch if we've had one in the right
store we have to draw the line somewhere
how many people would be for Halloween
we all know I wasn't gonna stop saying
weird sexual stuff so okay at least that
can go over somebody's head there
whereas f-bombs are just have fun yeah
see um the answer is yes yes it would it
wouldn't have the experience can Apple
confirm that it has no plans to use face
print data for any purpose other than
the operation of face idea these are all
good questions one the biggest one for
me is is face ID really going to be more
convenient and touch ID and that's one
that I'm having some trouble with
because they did show they did show it
operating not directly staring at the
phone which is the biggest issue I have
right now with iris ID by the time I
like go like this and I I swear probably
a good forty to fifty percent of the
time I use it I'm like yeah sure you
don't want to playing around with it a
lot of the time it would be faster for
me to just keep key in a pen because
fingerprints on lock on the back year of
device which that you iPhone people
aren't used to you can unlock that
sucker while it's still in your pocket
and you're bringing to your face it's
already there so you're saying that they
demonstrated this thing and it up to
sangil's it can already be unlocking
before it's even right that it's sitting
on the desk like they were simulating
the you know I'm being a rude
jackass at dinner experience where it
was sitting on the desk right there and
you had a real easy one no no this is
the this is the lame-o stuff I've done
the spicy one on stream before I've had
enough not to not today today's been a
long week I'll do it again but you know
I I just don't feel like it today so
iPhone 10 what is there to say really I
think one last comment is that the bezel
lessness of this Samsung Galaxy s8 is
way better what do you think how I not
held a 10 having not held at em it's not
bezel s it's just has thin bezels I
agree
um with that said there are times when
the infinity edge does interfere with me
reaching across the screen I have pretty
small hands but on the s8 in particular
it's not nearly as bad as it is for me
on the no date and I can pretty much
work with it I love the idea of the s8 I
haven't touched an iPhone 10 yet but I
really like this phone you can imagine a
screen that looks like that and is
curved and bezel is like that yeah but
the curved edge actually doesn't
register touch at all yeah like what if
there was a not visible but haptic bezel
a haptic bezel haptic I know what I mean
probably a matter of time I mean as soon
as Apple sees someone else build some
stupid weird squeeze engine they're
probably thinking wow that's like almost
smart except if they had done it with
forced touch or 3d touch then it would
be way better joint booyah I'm really
surprised I thought that 10 was gonna be
a knockoff of the edge but maybe that
was too far for Apple for even Apple
what do you think mm mm no I wouldn't
have expected that I honestly nothing
about it really surprised me the only
thing that surprised and/or disappointed
me was that we didn't end up with a
touch ID sensor under the screen because
if it had face ID and touch ID through
the screen but is because they failed to
do it properly that's the rumor yeah
your another question for you
Samsung is the bottleneck on their
kick-ass OLED
place hmm Samsung is making their
displays I'm sure Apple claimed step I'm
sure in the keynote they said this is
the best display you can get on a phone
is it the case that Samsung also has
those exact displays or is there an I
can extra exclusivity clause that Apple
has the rights to that display even
though Samsung's when making it funny
you bring that up the issue with
Samsung's display is the thing that
makes them not as good as Apple's is
that Samsung intentionally craps all
over them that's the issue you mean to
get other gains
I think they sacrifice something for
something else well they go bad they go
full Best Buy cranked the vividness mode
on it and it's something that I just I
don't think there's any way they're
gonna stop doing it there's an Asian
Sensibility versus American sensibility
I don't know it's a it's a hard thing to
ask there's a hard thing to say because
especially given how much research all
of these multinationals do on the
localization of a product for a given
region I would have to think that if it
was something that you know Americans
liked to have color accurate displays I
would have to imagine that other
filmmakers would also tune the displays
differently for different regions okay
so this is interesting apparently Craig
for sorry apparently Craig federighi
did go on the record with TechCrunch
answering some burning questions about
face ID so I don't have time to read the
whole thing but basically Apple does not
even have a way to give your your face
ID to law enforcement they never take
possession of the data anonymized or
otherwise it's all in the secure Enclave
etc etc etc local device yep yep um
they've discussed a two-factor
authentication so that you could
actually force the phone to require both
base ID and a pin you know when you like
a taste from earlier I just basically
had fire in my mouth for a second like
like lava just dragon dragon style just
said just bath just
make money do you need me for something
two minutes to take a picture Wow so
this is only your second time on land
show and you're gonna have to tackle a
topic all on your own
technically it's my third can you handle
not screwing this up probably not
probably not okay you want to do the
1070 ti I'm pretty loose right now
alright to do it all right hit it let's
see it where's the original article from
dang it James
damn it Bobby oh okay yeah techpowerup
dang it James um I don't know if you
guys took care of a nick just did an
awesome impression of the theme song did
king of the hill yeah I don't know if
we're allowed to play that so it's just
as mad over YouTube watch a 24 hour
livestream of king of the hill episodes
worth it yeah we're not promoting piracy
okay you are crossing so many lines
James I am kicking you off the land show
no actually I need you to cover for me
on the way so here's the original Thank
You Linus
original article there on tech power so
the basic deal is the rumor has it that
Nvidia is working on a new release of
probably my favorite rap discard the gtx
1070 it really hits a price performance
sweet spot and there's gonna be a new
one coming out we're not sure if they're
gonna call it 1070 ty or ti or if it's
just going to be an unnamed refresh
because that's what they've done in the
past for example they did a let me look
at my notes there's a refresh in the
past where instead of changing the name
they just put on the branding on the box
that what the new specs are so the 1080
and the 1060 both refreshed without name
changes the gtx 1066 iike by for example
is refreshed so the reason that nvidia
i'm talking to nobody here and it just
feels awkward the reason that they're
gonna do this refresh is because you
come sit with me
is because of Vega because the new RX
vagrant card sit right in between
TX and 70s and ten 80s and so since an
Nvidia can they might as well just
release a car that just sits right
beside that Vega mm-hmm now we're so
close I feel like we should KS yeah yeah
- please things are getting weird on the
LAN show oh but I go away for like
literally two minutes alone Wayne's
world falls apart the wine show may not
know that Linus hasn't really even seen
Wayne's right I've seen Wayne's World
but you don't care but I've seen it once
you can't quote it a long time ago then
you haven't seen it I know something
about party time excellent
a lot of the time when we're writing
scripts references that are shared
between us are like the bots that like
the essence of the humor like the fact
that we're both South Park fans comes up
a lot and I'm always going for Wayne's
World references and he doesn't get them
and it's just like I just everytime just
melt it's not that funny
it's basically an SNL skit stretched out
for way too long like if I recall
correctly the plot is just inane please
go you're gonna tell me you also like
the Cable Guy I bet uh that one I
haven't watched since childhood okay
as a child when it came out I literally
walked out of that movie your parents
where are you going well I was watching
with my grandma actually she was
sleeping you just peace I go to the
arcade grandma see yeah it was it was
that bad and I know that I'm probably
taking some flak in twitch chat right
now but cable guy was an awful awful
movie okay but what about the scene
where they're at that medieval times
restaurant and they're fighting is doing
that Star Trek theme song that's classic
no Mack stop it was not funny not funny
at all um why is everybody talking about
Rick and Morty because it's Paul they're
saying it's better than South Park it's
not better than South Park I mean Rick
and Morty has a couple episodes where I
feel like they've made some sort of like
some sort of social commentary
approaching the depth of an
in South Park episode mm-hmm but maybe
social commentary is not the Forte but
maybe it's not but I mean how do you so
you're saying it's apples oranges I'm
saying it's totally Apple store and I
think they're compared because they have
an overlapping fan base like types of
people who like South Park are the types
of people would like Reagan yeah but I
would say there's a lot of the types of
people who like both of them that
probably don't really get either of them
weird
so are you an splaining right now no I
don't think so I don't think I'm not
insulting Rick and Morty I I really like
like a lickin Morty oh that can Rorty
have to watch it um no I I I really like
Rick and Morty I just I don't think it's
comparable to South Park at all I mean
the other thing too is it's basically in
its infancy I mean if you go back and
look at season one of South Park season
one of Rick and Morty kind of stomps all
over it season one of South Park is
mostly toilet whereas by the time they
hit sort of season three to see sixes
Golden Age for sure yep six seven I mean
that stuff started to get really really
good I mean Rick and Morty's only on
their third season right now so and I
thought honestly I thought the last
episode was probably the best one of the
series so far in terms of actually
having a meaning that's deeper than you
know I'm I'm a silly scientist and I
burp when I talk and you know scary
stuff happens or whatever I thought the
the episode with the Citadel I thought
the episode sort of looking at life on
the Citadel was really interesting I it
it kind of you can kind of see that they
weren't necessarily really expecting
much in the way of continuity that's
also something that I think the show
both embraces and suffers from that they
don't really care that much about the
Citadel being explicitly described as
the effort of a few thousand Rick's the
first time that we're introduced to it
and then being expanded a couple seasons
later to basically being an entire
society of Rick's and Morty's that's you
know had all these struggles for so long
so iller Oh oops
and
have you realized or do you care that
okay no I don't I don't think anything I
said is a spoiler I will and I won't
give you guys any spoilers I mean
nothing that I've said will not be
obvious within about the first 30
seconds of the episode so you guys you
guys are all good
but in my opinion it's the best episode
of the show so far anyway carry on it's
not pickle Rick pickle Rick is just kind
of goofy like if you're if you're into
kind of silly humor then pickle Rick's a
great episode but it's one of my least
favorite so why don't you tell us why
and videos refreshing the 1070 why
didn't you just tell people why they're
refreshing the 1070 yeah pretty much
just as a response to Vega do you think
though they're gonna call it ty or not
um I wouldn't be surprised if they don't
if they don't yeah yeah III just it
might just be like cuz they yeah cuz in
the past they've done they've done at so
many other pressures it's something I
really don't like it's something that I
wish they wouldn't do but again we have
Apple to blame for all of this crap it
all comes back to Apple just calling
their product the same thing over and
over Dam it up so yeah I think the idea
here that is it's gonna smash or at
least be the same performance as Vega
but just with a lower TDP and a similar
price point so why wouldn't you get it
yep I think that I think that Nvidia
could have easily just sat on their
butts and done nothing about the Vega
launch because at this point they're
pretty much just printing money the rnd
for Pascal is so paid for but if they do
something then I mean I guess great I
mean that's that's what we want right we
want competition to mean better graphics
cards for all all right let's talk about
some more AMD news der power the deal
itting king is back he's back with more
news I got a little carried away there
second I don't get so this was posted on
the forum by Swanson and the original
the original article is actually a video
so it's go ahead and fire that up hey
Roman there you are bud so he comes out
and he's like hey AMD said that the two
extra dies on thread Ripper were
specifically dummies and it turns out
that they are not just silicon spacers
but they are disabled or at least
non-functional Zeppelin dyes that do
contain transistors what is it I would
they lie about this this is what I don't
get Wow okay so some people respect they
knew that it could mean that in the
future there may be a thirty-two core
thread river maybe they wanted to just
delay that little rumour from coming out
but it's taken until someone deleted it
for us to speculate on that I could
expect you agents no no well then as
possible as you are like I've heard
speculation about that going back to
Computex before threat or even launched
okay and this is from people in the
industry which always leaks so it always
becomes something that's speculated
outside the what did they explicitly say
that there was no transistors in there
yeah I just have a different definition
of dummy than you did why wouldn't they
just know they they specifically said
they were spacers well they are and that
they weren't failed dyes but if we can
see that they contain transistors then
okay what we don't necessarily know what
we don't necessarily know is that they
are exactly so they they did say no
working transistors so that could no you
know what no there's there's no I don't
really think there's any way around this
as far as I can tell these are I don't I
don't know I don't know what I don't
know what they are I just what I don't
understand is why they would come out
and say something like that when they
could have just said yeah they're failed
ones or they're the f-word inner product
launch yeah but everyone everyone talks
like everyone talks about the process of
bidding I think it's fairly well
understood
within the kind of enthusiasts community
that well Intel already saw this happens
Intel already got to be
smart me by saying shredder is glued
together so they could have said it's
just a bunch of failed chips glued
together
yeah but Intel does the same thing no
this is not that yeah but like it would
it would come across and we're really
insincere completely meaningless because
everybody does it so are you confused or
you actually just kind of upset okay I'm
just confused did they break you're
trying yes here we've got people saying
war boy act says if the cores were
enabled the CPU would have six or eight
channel memory also no it wouldn't
because the socket and the motherboards
wouldn't be wired up for it now it's
possible that AMD was hope that what
they were hoping to achieve was that
nobody would run out and try to unlock
course but then they couldn't possibly
have thought that no one at any point
was gonna rip apart one of the dies once
a thread ripper failed they couldn't
possibly have thought that because it is
really easy to tell like you can see
it's visible to the naked eye if you are
okay if you look at the video of the
7700 K that we are 67 under Kate
whatever the chip that fellow to the
Vice when merkel dropped it it broke
apart you can clearly see like the the
cash and the cores like 10 is visible to
the naked eye that that's that that's a
cpu die once the top breaks off you're
looking at me but I can think of right
now is that my stomach is the cauldron
they couldn't have possibly expected
people to not look at it at some point
so I don't know this just seems super
dumb and it's up to us to get answers
yeah I mean maybe they just didn't want
this is a good theory from also for more
boy X maybe they just didn't want people
you know running thread rippers and epic
sockets or vice versa maybe they wanted
to separate their consumer slash
prosumer from their server I don't know
I don't know but I'm I guess I'm over it
I just don't understand why they
wouldn't be straightforward about this
because they have nothing to gain and
their credibility to lose their
and there's a lot of times when you run
into stuff like this in the industry
where it just kind of goes why would you
deceive us about this no one could
possibly care that you were doing it
this way like the same way that everyone
has made CPUs since basically the dawn
time and by that I mean the last few
decades because that's as long as we've
had CPUs why not just say yeah we're
doing it that way same as usual unless
you count the brain what Bluetooth has
been hello there's more interesting ones
really more interesting ones all right
some attack vector Linux it's a scary
hack though because you're blue to the
justice beyond and you can get hack iOS
has been immune since 10:00 Google
provided device manufacturers with a
patch last month but it's up to them to
push it wha-wha except the likes of
Samsung to push yeah apparently there
are literally billions of devices that
are compromised
yeah but they this has been perhaps
since July so well on Windows okay we're
not talking about it yeah all right fine
what else do you got for me
no it's boring Google offers free
repairs to pixel owners affected by
Hurricane Harvest now this is the
opposite of what we're just talking I
see this being abused this is an
opportunity this is low-hanging fruit
this is an opportunity for a company at
Google to get some kick-ass PR during a
very hard time for lots of Americans to
say you know what guys free repairs if
your phone that's not as waterproof as
some phones on the market gets damaged
in this hurricane crisis how many people
are gonna take them up on that not that
many so that is some cheap good PR yeah
we're talking about it
okay all right cheap good PR I don't
know that this is gonna be entirely good
PR but let's have a look at the element
six
this is Olson I'm willing to commit the
craziest case that I've ever seen so
this is an appearance I don't think that
non-functional prototype that looks like
the final product let's go ahead and
skip back over here check this thing out
I guess I don't like that it looks like
a car but that's the idea
it doesn't look enough like a car though
it looks like an abstraction of a car no
no no no no cuz the finish one will be
more like this like it has a little
grill on it
well no it's also got like cutouts for
the windows and the windshield like
basically this is supposed to be like
the case that's unlike any other case
they're trying to merge art and
technology yes they're making a case
that's carbon fiber yes that belongs on
the desk of like the CEO all of that is
awesome I just disagree with the form
factor they chose being this particular
car shape why doesn't want to look like
why it look like a car it should just
look like some kind of weird form if
anything you think so like a little
carbon-fiber blob or something so there
there's kind of the best look that we
have at what the finished finish will
look like what the girls will look like
this is done by the singularity
computers guys if it was anyone else
then I'd be like yeah that's dumb forget
it okay in Australia oh yeah but these
guys know gorgeous gorgeous work and
these guys if there was anyone that I
think would actually be able to build
something like this and make it
incredible these guys would be it why is
that just because they have they have a
long history of just building amazing
art pieces they only got two backers
though so it seems like most people
agree with you or at least most people
with 6,000 US dollars that's what the
pledges that the minimum pledge that's
not the minimum pledge but that's the
minimum pledge to get a case
I did the math they're looking for 148
thousand US dollars yeah that will sell
too that will allow them to build 24
units so that's like 60 100 bucks each
I mean obviously they had to get the
expertise that to build the facility
like there's people hours involved but
they already have salt like they're
gonna retail for six grand eventually
they just want to become a case manager
this will never be retail they're gonna
sell them on their site how are they
didn't you read by comprehensive show
notes
no imma let you in on a little secret
you allowed to give me shit about them
poo okay
poo emoji about them so I don't know I I
think it's cool I don't I
okay you know what I actually don't have
much of a defense for it so this was
originally posted by North Storm on the
forum I think it's cool I think it's
different I think it's something
different
definitely and I think that it's good
for the industry to see things that are
different and I hope it succeeds so I
hope you succeed sue there I do alright
this one I'm not really sure what I want
just puppy on my desk tonight things
sweet this is another thing I want to
watch you want to watch I like to watch
Oh
Phillips ready the curved ultra wide 492
p8 display a 49 inch 32 by 9 so to be
clear this is two of them stacked one on
top of the other stacked one on top of
the other because for some reason you
would you would want to spend $2,200 to
have one bezel rather than a cross of
bezels when you could have done it for a
fraction of the cost
I'd write if I were to have I there's
nothing for display I'd rather put them
side-by-side I have this kick it
you know okay as someone who's actually
done ultra wide Eyefinity I can tell you
the experience is not as good as you
might think
it's like looking I wasn't looking up
high although that's probably only the
same height as that last tall monitor we
looked at ya know probably but I don't
like it by nine this thing
is just bizarre
so the original articles from a non tech
there it's not quantum dot there's no
free sync to the refresh rate is unknown
it's about a grand and the resolution is
oh of course you own oh there it is
38 40 by 1080 what were you going to say
I was about to say that of course the
same guy who didn't put in any of the
specs of the new iPhones wouldn't put
the resolution of a monitor but you did
600 its brightness is pretty high five
thousand to one contrast I find kind of
hard to believe and listen that's what
they always say our tests never have
anything close to maybe a VA panel set
to launch in q2 of 2018 we have already
confirmed we are getting one well all
this is to say you miss a critic crucial
piece here so we've seen a super all
tried already from Samsung that got
announced this is actually the same
panel Samsung is supplying the panel to
Philips okay it's just Samsung's is more
gamer II Samsung's is 144 Hertz we don't
know the refresh rate at this one yeah
Samsung's is quantum quantum dot and all
these other expensive features this is
value one exactly so if you're not a
gamer if you just want to look at the
stock for working Schmo who needs 49
inches of display for your average Joe
who still has a thousand bucks but not
1500 bucks
this is it alright fair enough all right
so I think that pretty much does it for
the wham show for this week thanks guys
for tuning in thanks James for coming on
for the last time and we will see you
guys again next week same bat-time same
bat-channel can you at least go the rest
of the show without dropping any f-bombs
Frank fairly ferngully
firetruck oh by the way the calendar

of tech calendar No

coming out till next summer by the way
next summer yeah no this is q2 2018 oh I
know but we're getting one apparently
the land show twitch chat is terrible I
really don't know what does that mean
what do you mean by that what this
person was expecting just someone posted
on the forum the LAN show twitch chat is
