around the arrival of my third and final
offspring that delayed the release of
this video sorry about that but good
news everyone it's finally here desk PC
part 2 the finishing touches tunnel bear
is the simple VPN app that makes it easy
to browse privately and enjoy a more
open Internet to try tunnel bear for
free check out the link in the video
description so step 1 was to remove the
literal dust that had settled on this
project then roll it over to our
shooting location to begin work those of
you who haven't seen part 1 you should
probably go back and watch it up there
but I'll get you up to speed anyway
we've constructed this desk out of a
single piece of MDF and we made a slight
miscalculation that resulted in our
piece of glass that we got on Craigslist
being slightly smaller than our desk no
problem so now that we're back at it
we're gonna manufacture a small lip to
both hide our error and to hold our
glass snugly in place and keep it from
sliding around so while my dad ran to
Home Depot to get the necessary cuts
made Jake set to work on one of the most
important steps of any complicated
custom build pre-testing to ensure that
the hardware works before you install it
then it was time to begin what would
prove to be by far the most hideous part
of this entire process a lining hardware
as perfectly as possible and creating
all of the mounting points that we're
going to need for final assembly so
after a quick test hole in a scrap piece
of wood we were ready to create the
motherboard now which was actually one
of the simpler ones we just positioned
it with the correct spacing to allow for
cable management up the side later hope
the marker through the holes Center
punch and drilled for the same threaded
inserts that I used for the bottom
mounted desk PC project which you can
check out here then there was another
delay I think a big part of why this
project
taken so long has been in decision done
we have many other holes in debate for
the rest of the day are you creating
work that's like two minutes are you
creating work out of no I'll leave no
work
okay just cuz you're new you don't have
any handy skills you're the handiest
person I know right
okay so with that out of the way it was
time to work on water cooling now the
original concept was to use hard line
tubing like every other desk PC ever but
in part because hard line is tedious and
in part because we wanted to do
something a little bit different we
ended up deciding to drill five eighths
inch holes through to the bottom of the
table and route both our cables and our
tubing down there for a really clean
look so with that settled we were able
to mark the mounting points for the
radiators in such a way that the air
holes wouldn't interfere with our
diagonally positioned legs on the bottom
and then move on to the hard drives hard
drives were another case of we came in
with one plan and left with a completely
different one we were originally going
to use L brackets and screw them into
threaded inserts from the top but hey
why not put the standoffs in the drives
then drill all the way through and use
long 632 bolts so using templates we
aligned our four drive raid 10 as best
we could and then after a test fit with
our custom length cable mod SATA cables
we ended up having to widen the holes a
little bit for some more wiggle room but
it looks pretty good and hey at least we
missed accidentally drilling through the
legs on the bottom right this time we
did
no such luck with the reservoirs spacing
wise we wanted to keep somewhat
consistent with what we've done with the
hard drives which put our tubing right
over the leg now what well we ended up
drilling straight down then veering off
at an angle with our 5/8 inch bit it's
not perfect but the hole isn't that much
bigger and once it painted black it
shouldn't end up being that noticeable
leading us to lower problem
while my dad worked on the outer lip I
began work on the radiators while the
fan holes for them won't interfere with
the legs the tubing unfortunately will
so if we flip it over and we try and go
straight down to the bottom of the table
we go right into the legs if we have the
tubing come up and then out we're short
and elbow fitting and we end up with one
of the tubes really close to where the
tubes go through for the reservoirs and
it's going to end up looking dumb damn
it Jake so I decided to change gears and
work on the mounting for the GPU and the
SSD so I decided on a height for the
floating video card mount and got the
water block installed on our GT X 1080
so that we could build the mount and
Mark our tubing holes while my dad built
a small wooden post with a threaded
insert to mount our PCI Express SSD so
we made good progress for a while we
completed the SSD mount it lined up
perfectly then we decided to use some
extra mounting holes that ek left open
in their block design to bolt the GPU
into the bottom of the desk with inserts
and we finalize the holes for the power
supply and then we went back to debating
the damn radiators and pumps again then
it was drill drill drill insert holes
for the GPU and power supply re
measuring the very approximated holes
for the CPU block tubing drilling holes
for the GPU and damn it I hit a leg
again this time I cracked a support but
it doesn't seem to be a major structural
issue next we drilled the holes for the
front intakes they're not quite perfect
but we're going to cover them with some
Silverstone filters for now that'll mask
small errors and later on I might ask
proto case to make something custom for
it after running out of battery because
that hole saw is a bit of a beast and
running out to Home Depot for a corded
drill we drilled the holes for the
radiator tubing hit the legs again holy
crap I wish we had planned that out a
little bit better and we are finally
done the holes except wait no no I need
holes for the power wires for the pumps
and the fans we also grabbed a power
sander and some 220 grit sandpaper while
we were out remember though that this
step would
it'd be necessary if we hadn't bummed up
the size of our desks so it shouldn't
affect your cost if you were to recreate
the project and some washable furnace
filter that along with some exacto knife
cut border pieces should be a pretty
darn good solution to allowing access to
the machine's i/o while keeping out dust
the pumps and radiators go back in one
more time to drill their power holes and
we are pretty much ready to paint which
I'm going to do off-camera whenever I
have some time so part three will be the
final assembly and the conclusion and I
promise it won't take as long as part 1
- Part 2 did so stay tuned and stay
tuned on master opcom mass drop is the
site well community really where users
talk about products they're interested
in buying then mass drop kind of goes oh
yeah what's that you're interested in
goes to the manufacturers or authorized
resellers and places a bulk order at a
discounted price then the more people
buy it the lower the price goes and now
they're featuring a drop for the hi-fi
man re zero zero I am
they feature nine millimeter dynamic
drivers they ship with two pairs of
silicone ear tips and there are only 35
u.s. dollars whoo so check them and
other drops out at the link in the video
description mass drop has all kinds of
stuff everything from audio gear to
keyboards to like camping here so thanks
for watching guys that the video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured at Amazon in
