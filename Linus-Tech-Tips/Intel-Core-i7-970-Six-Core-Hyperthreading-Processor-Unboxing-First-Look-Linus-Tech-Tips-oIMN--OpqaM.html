been on the market for a long time but
there is a reason that I have not
unboxed it yet the reason is that it was
not really priced and sort of in line
with what I would really consider buys
okay so let's leave it at that but with
the recent price drop from Intel this
CPU is now down to sort of real people
level of pricing and it used to be that
it was only like a hundred bucks or so
less then then the extreme edition six
core nine ATX well now it's
significantly less so it actually makes
a fair bit of sense to invest in a 970
so in 970 as I mentioned before it is a
six core processor the stock clock speed
of this guy is actually 3.2 gigahertz so
it is a very very very fast chip and it
features hyper threading it has 12 Meg's
of cash in fact besides the lower clock
speed it has all of the same features as
the Extreme Edition chips but for a much
lower price about half so what's the
drawback you guys well it includes the
same installation instructions
three-year warranty and Intel Inside
logo label although you can see the logo
label is now blue instead of black which
is obviously less high-performance we
have the same included six core ready
Intel stock heatsink so that is with the
large fan tower heatsink it has four
heat pipes lots of incidental airflow
for the area around the CPU socket nice
rigid backplate nice smooth contact
surface as well as where'd it go ah here
it is as well as some included no that's
not it is it in here cameraman is
pointing at the others as well as
included thermal compound oh yes but
just like that okay so it has included
thermal compound it has the performance
and quiet switch for the included fan
and uses a four pin sleeved pwm fan
alright so it has all that going for it
it goes on the LGA 1366 socket just like
the Extreme Edition processors it is
this size and shape just like the
Extreme Edition processors looks just
like
extreme edition processor so the
difference is that it is not unlocked
this is not an unlocked processor
however unlike the p67 platform the x58
chipset does support overclocking of non
unlocked processors so with a little bit
more effort and a little bit more skill
you can actually take a 970 to nearly
the same speeds that you can achieve
with a 980 X or a 990 X unlocked
processor so basically it's just a
matter of it's missing the extreme label
and it is not unlocked those are the
disadvantages of grabbing a 970 so this
as far as six cores go is the best value
from Intel at the time of filming this
