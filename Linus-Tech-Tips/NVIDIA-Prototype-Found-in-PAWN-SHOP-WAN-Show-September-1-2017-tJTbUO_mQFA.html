window time or rather it was van
Showtime um a little while ago but we
ran into an issue kid a guy can I get
that that tangle of fans actually Alex
do you mind yeah so just to give you
guys some idea of what sort of problem
we were dealing with before the show
here well this is part of it
and Alex probably has some other parts
of it but not on hand because he's
actually still working on the video that
we're all yeah oh that's good that's
good yep yeah we got there is going to
be there's gonna be some some definite
you know school of hard knocks
engineering going on in this video right
here so that should be pretty good but
we've got a great show for you guys
today I think as you may or may not have
noticed I have what's this hi everybody
oh I see I don't understand the
politically correct culture these days
are we even allowed to do that yeah like
I don't know is that like and like is
that Italian or like like are you
allowed to it's doctor Nick yeah he's
our minority because there's only one
doctor Nick yeah so I don't know if
you're allowed to do that no I was no
that's canon you can do that no I don't
know I was recently informed that you're
not allowed to say max is a member of a
Facebook group where you're not allowed
to say y'all because it's cultural
appropriation and I was kind of sitting
here going but that's just a word isn't
it just a appropriating whom um not who
you'd think is all is all I'm really
gonna get into but yeah I just thought
what to call the conjunction yeah
yeah I thought it was just you all it is
yeah I thought yes depends who started
it but I think the people who started it
are part of an imperialist ik
capitalistic society it's fair game
because that society is grounded and
formed around appropriation that's all
they do
hmm all we do all right well we've got a
bunch of great optics for you guys today
intel launches
Zeon w-4 workstations further separating
their servers Aeon products from their
core i7 core i9 and core I'd give
whatever else and oo also pentium
consumer products and rising thread
Ripper gets rounded out with the final
chip the 1900 X it has arrived yeah I
don't think anyone was really waiting
for it but well we'll talk about that in
more depth later AMD is rumored to be
losing $100 or more on every Vegas 64
they sell which would be pretty bananas
if true although I have no guarantee
whatsoever that it actually is and what
else we got here
and Linus's phone number and email are
probably on the internet now as there's
been a huge Instagram reach of six
million users data oh yeah
great I'm glad we're covering that amen
News's news this is unbiased objective
journalism
are you looking into it right now aren't
you no
take this that's Luke sitting on the
couch in the intro thank yous no that's
me on the right yeah right yeah the
right wait what perfect alright so for
those of you who aren't familiar this is
James he's one of the new writers I
don't even know if it's fair to call you
guys new anymore have you been here what
like six months almost something like
that I don't know five five it's
February February yeah it's like six
months yeah that's Frankie Thank You
Colton okay crazy yeah I mean people are
apparently throwing you're throwing
things out there so James is actually
the one who prepares the land show
document for us every week and has been
doing so for about the last the entire
time yeah pretty much since it started
yeah so the first week he did it it kind
of sucked that's not true and then the
second week it was like pretty decent
and since then I mean honestly it's been
kind of hard to tell the difference
which either means that James is a rock
star or means that Colton was just
frankly never any better at this than
some guy who started it about two weeks
ago
bit of both um alright so first topic
here is the red ripper I know it
wouldn't be it wouldn't be when show I
wish I could have all the thread
reparation II what I have to work with
here he gets touch screens oh yeah poor
you 2016 sucks a 2016 LG Graham and who
has the 2017 one me it's a way gray near
because that is the way of the world
that's the curl of the burl big dog big
dog and then table scraps dog huh ah oh
that's how it's gonna be alright
so the original topic here was posted on
the forum by Ono tech and basically I
don't know I don't even know I don't get
it how is this even newsworthy why is
this even in here you can explain the
red ripper and the title dude that's
news am i right unfortunately yes yes
thread Ripper related his news but this
is askew that beyond a very limited
use-case frankly I don't really
understand so the thread Ripper 1900 X
has the same 64 PCIe lanes as the other
thread Ripper skews it's got the same
LGA whatever it is TR for socket as the
other thread Ripper skews it's got a
nice you know high base clock 3.8 versus
3.6 gigahertz for the 1800 X which is
the lower clock actually very similar
version of kind of the same processor
because this is only an eight core chip
so it's more comparable to the 1800 X in
terms of its performance than it is to
its bigger brothers the 1920 X in the
1950 X right to spin it another way it
basically almost is the 1900 X except
with a slightly higher base clock I mean
the 1800 XC yeah the 1900 X is almost
like the 1800 X except it has a higher
base clock and it basically grants you
access to all the X 399 goodies for 50
bucks more so for 50 bucks more you get
the privilege of buying a more expensive
motherboard right quite a bit more
expensive model yeah a lot more
expensive motherboard not to mention
that now you can go buy quad channel
memory quad channel memory that will
probably never be necessary for any kind
of reasonable workload for an eight-core
processor now to be clear I can come up
with a thanks bixby I don't know what
prompted Bixby to start yakking over
there now to be clear there are a couple
workloads I can think of for this
so for example a soos released
what was it I think a nineteen PCIe slot
motherboard I'm gonna I'm gonna have to
double check this it might not have been
nineteen yeah here it is a soos debuts
the b250 expert mining aetherium
motherboard with 19 PCIe slots so with a
thread ripper chip you could
theoretically do like what like 60 of
so you could literally just cover like
an e ATX motherboard in PCIe 1x slots
and and power adapters apparently I
didn't even realize this it's not just
graphics cards
it is also thousand watt plus power
supplies that are running into huge
supply issues right now is talking to a
system was that right yeah I was down at
Puget systems yesterday as some of you
guys are probably aware if you saw the
stream and they're like yeah it's like
actually a problem we're having a hard
time getting thousand watt power
supplies which may also explain that you
go why Corsair didn't want to send us
their ax 1500 I for that build that
we're doing because they can probably
turn around and sell that thing like
billy-o yeah but what's worth more to
them the retail price of that power
supply or whatever exposure we hope well
I don't know that's like 400 plus dollar
power supplies so it's it's pretty it's
pretty significant yeah but the in the
ad inventory on our channel is worth
more than $4 yeah maybe
um the one 1000 watt power supply that
is no problem for us to get is the
thousand dollar one though that puppy
12-under watts is it 1200 watts what it
was I thought it was a thousand watt no
do you want to talk about the build that
you have coming up kind of but it's kind
of secret - no I don't think it's oh
okay we don't use an embargoed case yes
okay uses an embargoed case but I know
you guys you got you guys saw you know
some of the low end stuff that we're
always focused on okay and you guys were
like Linus you know why are you guys
always doing you know all the low end
stuff all the time
I want something that I can afford I
want to see a $6,000
thread Ripper build and James is here to
answer the call yes I am it's pretty
badass
it's got 128 gigabytes of RAM which I
didn't even know that it has eight dims
but wait more importantly they're all
RGB
you see this is what I have to deal with
around here I'm no longer even in
control of this that's just like it
doesn't just hit icebergs it like it
like calls to the iceberg you got ice
crews working on the ship it takes like
a big hook and it kind of goes be at
beaches and and then it pulls them in
and Kapow you don't even know yet six
months and this is only the tip of the
iceberg
okay and I can't take full credit for
all the terrible puns that have been in
the that have been in the videos
recently either as you guys can clearly
clearly see lift I think that we've hit
peak pun we're all the way down now
they've all been used like in the first
bill got I did which was the RGB bill
guide yeah every every paragraph was a
pun cuz you could talk about the chassis
or the case and save in this case but
now that's been done yeah but I okay
yeah but that was your first time doing
it I had already done it many many times
should we just keep them coming just ah
they're always fresh every time I think
we I think we do keep them coming
because you know if you do that then
they'll always be in a state of ecstasy
or cringe
I'll admit it took me longer to get that
Vanisher divide to look um alright so
why don't we get back to the 1900 X so
basically the point of this chip is if
you need quad-core wait okay you need
quad-channel memory and you need a ton
of PCIe lanes but you don't want a hike
or count processor or maybe and this is
the pitch that I've heard for something
like a 77 40 X on the intel side of
things maybe you want to invest in a
platform that has a greater has greater
opportunities for upgrading in the
future and you just don't have the money
to spend right now but so would that be
someone who's maybe they're getting this
for professional use case but it's still
their side business they haven't jumped
in fully because this is we're talking
about a high ceiling here yes we're
talking you could go all the way from 8
to 16 or you know word on the street is
that AMD would love to deliver even more
course than that in their gaming lineup
and it wouldn't be that much of a
stretch because to my knowledge the tr4
socket is not that different from the
server socket so there's already 32 core
processors there have really how much
more of a challenge is it for them to
deliver a 32 core on the desktop
assuming that we could figure out how to
cool the bloody thing which is actually
maybe we'll talk about that in a little
bit more depth later that's a video that
Anthony's been working on like a taming
the Beast is air cooling or water
cooling a better answer for these super
high wattage new CPUs like thread Ripper
and the answer may surprise you
ooh I'm hoping this is going to be a
callback to the dua of quantum computing
it's gonna be up there oh right yeah
it's like we have to pull back even to
cool of 32 core thread Ripper it's gotta
be superconductors and you know what
I've already filmed it so it's far too
late and that's not in it so you'll just
have to sit and be sad all right let's
move on to the quote unquote
frickin huge Instagram breach apparently
I'm screwed
I haven't read this are
yet it was posted by oli on the forum
the original article here is from ARS
technica but maybe James would like to
explain exactly how I am screwed because
of this I'm not sure you're screwed but
it's only ten dollars this us to find
out how screwed you are so what happened
was 3/8 it started off as a bug what a
value that's what sure that's what your
privacy is worth so what what started
off as a bug in or an exploit available
from Instagram got totally scaled up by
some industrious hacker basically there
was a bug some kind of some kind of a
data security research firm thought that
this bug could not be exploited in an
automatic automated way
but then this hacker who ended up
contacting ARS technica did manage to
automate it so that he was able to
scrape this giant database of instagrams
700 million users at a rate of what is
it a million a million accounts per hour
a million accounts per hour so he
managed to get 6 million accounts into a
database then you put that database
online in a query Herbal website it's 10
bucks a query you can type in an
Instagram handle and get either a phone
number an email or both Wow
so this person contacted ARS technica
and actually provided them with a 10,000
record example spreadsheet of the type
of data that he had scraped and then
they had some statistics from that
spreadsheet so I think it was 4,000 out
of the 10,000 had both emails and phone
numbers Wow and then the remaining 6,000
had mixed and then if you were looking
at that spreadsheet based on the user
names they found out that they were like
verified actual accounts not just BOTS
or whatever and they also found out that
looking at the emails and the phone
numbers just based on area codes and
stuff it seemed like the personal data
matched the accounts and it looks real
interesting so to be clear not everyone
got breached so I mean even at a rate of
a million accounts an hour it would have
taken almost
two weeks to download the entire 700
million user records but it's still a
significant problem and I mean another
thing is I guess that realistically
there's not 700 million active users so
no actually if you look at graphs of
users yeah host ratio like the vast
majority of Instagram accounts have
never posted right they're just created
so probably you're okay
but also maybe you're super not okay and
depends if there's any logic in the
scrape and how it targeted people so the
biggest risk here is that some for some
exposed people it's their email and
their phone that have been exposed and
didn't you get hacked one time it's a
someone had your email and phone it was
a little more complicated than that but
yes it's it is possible if you have
someone's phone number and you know who
their carrier is and you can manage to
convince their carrier that you are that
person it's possible to get a sim issued
in that number and then you can use that
phone to break into other county sector
that are using two-factor authentication
with the phone number as a backup so
good luck everyone and let's go ahead
and move on to our next topic
Amazon turns thousands of twitch
streamers that's us right now
hey which is why we can't show you
anything oh no nope can't show you that
into product pitch men ladies as it
worked
original article here is from Bloomberg
you know I like the Bloomberg I always
like to throw a couple Bloomberg's in
there sure that's fine I like it so
Spencer Soper says amazon.com Inc will
pay commission to gamers artists chefs
and others in on it's twitch interactive
video streaming service for selling
products to their fans through its
retail site I mean to be clear it's not
like Amazon wasn't already paying twitch
streamers to sell products to the people
who were viewing I mean it's no secret
that Linus Media Group is a member of
the Amazon Associates affiliate program
and anyone who's
of the program if someone were to buy a
product through their affiliate link
they would get a commission I mean
that's something that legally you have
to disclose the only thing that's lying
here yes and they're calling this
program the gear on Amazon the only
that's new is that they've integrated
these affiliate links and widgets right
on to streamers pages so I assumingly we
could at some point just point down and
say yeah check with these headphones in
this little picture right here and I
think the Commission's are probably the
same it says you can get a commission of
up to 10% and I think most affiliates
can get that provided you sell enough
volume but the lower end is usually four
percent yeah at the low end it's usually
about four percent higher and it depends
on the category as well
so some categories and I believe this is
posted publicly so I don't feel you can
just google anyone can join an Amazon
affiliate program you scroll down to the
bottom of Amazon there's like a become a
partner or something linked on the
bottom you can do this with Etsy and
affiliate - program yeah it looks like
you don't have to be logged in or
anything like that so like digital
services for example some of them are
actually not percentage based like if
you sign someone up for prime then you
get just a fixed bounty sometimes
they'll do bonuses but yeah here we go
so some hope Amazon giftcards don't get
anything anymore apparently neither just
wine that's a fine thing that because I
would think there's enough margin and
alcohol that you could afford to a
little British turn of phrase I did
there hmm funny thing that oh wow I did
yeah well thank you video games and game
consoles are a 1% Commission Lucy that's
gonna be harsh for this the streamers
for sure yep
televisions 2% PC components used to be
closer to like three and a half to four
and now they are two and a half percent
toys or three so basically the stuff
gets easy to sell where there's like so
many like gaming sites and gaming blogs
and Game streamers where they just
really I guess feel like they don't have
to work that hard at it
really low commission rates but then you
move up into digital music physical
music handmade things groceries digital
videos 5% you move all the way up to
like headphones musical instruments
business and industrial supplies well
now you're talking 6% and you can get up
to 10% for men's and kids private label
digital video games luxury Beauty Amazon
coins and Amazon fashion women are there
any twitch streamers in like the beauty
cosmetic space like they're on YouTube
um you know what to be perfectly honest
with you I have never watched a twitch
stream outside of tuning into Luke's
with like it muted to kind of talk to
his chat I don't really I don't really
get it okay yeah well I'm old and stuff
so like I'm like I'm like shaking my
cane on the front porch like old man
style like my kids are gonna be like
yeah I watch you know whatever gamer
Tron person and I'm gonna be like go
outside go kick a ball like did go go go
just do anything anything but that but
I'm gonna be wrong and those people are
gonna be like the the superstars of that
generation and it's and it's I'm gonna
be old and I accept that
so there you go at least you're still
thing going to be old
yeah I'm 31 now I feel pretty old
alright so let's have a look at our next
topic here oh yeah wait did we go
through like what's different about it
really
apparently the Commission's will be
available to 22,000 twitch partners I
really think it's just the widget I
think the 22,000 partners yeah I just be
the number of partners they have like
partners is just like creators who have
signed up or streamers who have signed
up for the affiliate partner isn't it no
it depends because they're different Joe
- yeah there's different tiers of twitch
partners that's something that I do know
because I know that Luke even though he
like doesn't are at times hasn't met
like certain partner requirements as a
partner and then like I think we are
even though we definitely don't meet the
partner requirement
so like us yeah so it's a little bit
complicated all right
but as far as Amazon's concerned this is
kind of just their their version of
YouTube you know how Amazon touches
everything right mm-hmm prime is their
Netflix they've got grocery now this
even though this is a much much smaller
version of a video platform what did it
say they have 10 million viewers a day
crazy but you're compared to YouTube is
nothing
so speaking of nothing let's say your
phone had nothing on it in terms of
storage this is pretty cool
a SanDisk just launched their largest
ever micro SD card but wait it's exactly
the same size as the other ones you mean
it's still micro how else would it fit
in the slot come on you guys clearly we
meant the capacity it's in it's the
largest ever it costs 250 dollars but if
you for whatever reason felt like you
needed to carry around like what would
that be that's like what 15 blu-rays
worth of data if you need if you felt
like you had a phone that was capable of
playing back like I I don't even know
can you do that can you play back like
an MKV on a phone like I guess it's
probably possible like there's VLC
enough yeah I mean do they have a
hardware decoding for that not sure
actually Android Oreo might I know that
Oreo we just added some new codecs like
from Sony there was a so a proprietary
Sony codec that Oreo supporting it would
depend on the hardware though so it
would be if the if the Adreno GPU has
like hardware decoding for that quality
of h26 I mean probably people are
probably correcting me in twitch chat
but yeah I guess there's probably no
reason you couldn't play back full
quality blu-rays on your phone plus a
lot of phones are getting HDR now other
than that it would be really stupid
because honestly on a phone screen it is
pretty hard to tell the difference
between like a decent 720p video stream
and like the highest quality that you
can stream on plex let alone like a full
blu-ray quality but here's the question
that was on my mind when I read this
line yeah I kind of thought big deal I
can't they release a headline like this
every month like is this just an
incremental upgrade because these you
know just like processing power like
these things are just on up and to the
right at all times yes and no I mean it
has slowed down even in the time since
linus media group was founded all of
this stuff has slowed down significantly
I like it used to be that you got a new
like doubling of hard drive capacities
it felt like every few months and you
know in the okay so here in the time
since I've been a PC enthusiast so it
must have been in around 2003 2004 when
you went to the store and bought like a
decent sized hard drive it was a hundred
and twenty gigs
oh I remember the first computer that my
family bought it was 30 gigs okay so in
2003 2004 like an enthusiast would run
out and buy a hard drive that was
anywhere from 80 to 120 gigs and you
could get higher ones but they were like
pretty pricey okay when Linus media
group started that was 2003 that was ten
years later 13 it was about three
terabytes since then so that is that is
what and a factor of what so times 10
times 3 so that's 30 times the size in
that 10 years so since then we've gone
from 3 to 12 so we've managed to 4x and
it's been almost five years so think
about that well I actually catfished you
a little bit because the answer to my
questions in the show notes because this
new 400 gigabyte card is going to be the
new world record holder for this format
and the previous holder that they're
displacing was
Samsung who had 256 gigabytes yep and
that's just last year but it had been a
little while so that's something that
you might not be factoring in and
honestly I think the bigger deal for
mobile storage for for flashcards is
really going to be a speed increase
versus just continuing to ramp up the
capacity because we've got standards
like shoot what's that
there's a new super small card standard
ID it's it's escaping me right now but
we've got standards coming that are
gonna perform much more similarly to a
full speed SATA Drive or even a PCI
Express Drive and this card sure 400
gigs but it only copies data at a
hundred megabytes a second so it would
actually take a really really long time
to fill it up like I don't it's not like
you could use your phone as like a super
high speed you know
external drive for your laptop when
you're on the road and your video
editing or something like that not at
those kinds of speeds no that's bunk so
I don't really understand what you're
gonna be keeping on it unless it's
something ridiculous like oh I need to
carry my blu-ray collection with me yeah
ventually this is just gonna be your
you're way way way cold storage backup
this is your Amazon Glacier microSD
cards mic rest yeah use it yeah I got
the whole business here
amazing amazing amazing storage density
don't mind that the cost is just
completely uncompetitive with tape don't
worry about that also the the incredibly
complicated controller we need to access
you know I mean what would that be that
would be like you know a thousand micro
SD cards in the space of a single tape
drive cartridge is like what what
controller is that because you'd
basically be looking at like an
incredibly complex SSD controller by
that point all right what else we got
for today what else is interesting but
this are we touch stuff yeah sure look I
normally organize the show notes with
more boring things or nice things at the
bottom and this is pretty close to the
bottom but I feel like I'm here
and I think it's kind of cool sure like
the screen shot is in the show notes so
we should just open it that way so
basically we've been on like this walkie
keyboard kick for a little money
hey I just work here so I've done like
three alternative keyboards we did the
advantage too which is an ergonomic one
then we did the safe type keyboard which
is just a more obscure organ on my
keyboard and now we've done the or B
touch which is coming up on the on
floatplane end on youtube soon as the or
B touch is a keyless keyboard it's got
these two domes that you move around in
a coordinated fashion the process is
called courting so basically there's I
think eight or so different clusters of
letters on the one hand and I'll point
to one cluster and then with the other
hand you specify which symbol in the
cluster you actually want to do it
sounds like a cluster to me whoo-hoo
okay but beyond the actual keyboard the
companies actually ported this same
typing method to VR and while the
keyboard is aimed at people who have low
finger dexterity in VR it's actually
probably just the better way to type for
everybody right because you just you
just gesture for which key you want to
press unfortunately your link doesn't
work because you link to your own inbox
oh I didn't know that works I would yeah
no that that's definitely not on my
inbox but blob not log dude I you have
the keys it's sort of go to LastPass get
my password go to my email no no I can't
I know I don't I don't have your
LastPass information that's not how
LastPass words I actually can't look at
what you store in it without locking you
out so I'm using it wrong I shouldn't
put that in there
anyway the point is everyone has
everyone who's used VR has probably felt
a little silly holding these kick-ass
touch controllers and then using them to
like laser beam a letter on a key yeah
it's actually really inefficient and the
worst part about it is that whenever
you're pointing at a letter when you
pull the trigger it like moves your hand
a little bit so typing with any kind of
reasonable speed is actually pretty
difficult and fatiguing I mean if you're
the if you liked it like Tom Cruise that
and always hold your touch controller
out like that instead of Brandon leaing
and holding it close to your body you
after all that typing time your arms
gonna get tired you know speaking of
your arms getting tired
let's go ahead and do one of our sponsor
spots energy so synergy allows you to
use let's see it allows you to use one
keyboard and one Mouse with multiple
systems so let's say for example that I
had a like a Mac Pro MacBook Pro that I
like to use for development and let's
say for example that I had a Windows
desktop that I like to use for gaming in
the circle yeah typical that's right
instead of being instead of having to
have a separate set of peripherals on my
desk for each of them I could just have
a single keyboard and mouse hooked up to
both of them through the network so you
just install synergy on your systems and
boom you can drag your mouse across the
screens completely seamlessly they've
got a basic and pro option with a
one-time payment for lifetime access and
the features include things like
clipboard sharing between the computers
which is pretty freakin cool
dragging and dropping files between the
computers the ability to set up hotkeys
and more and what's really cool about
synergy is that they actually give us a
wicked freaking awesome discount to give
you guys you can save 50% off synergy by
going to seamless dot-com / synergy
slash Linus 25 that's seamless comm
slash synergy slash Linus 25 what's the
25 stand for
I don't know hope a naughty amount
you'll get off hopefully it's not like a
25% off code and like my notes are wrong
because it wouldn't be the first time
that we did something like that it's
just a vestige of let's go find out no
no it's all fine it's all good 50% off
synergy for Linus tech tips viewers 9
bucks for 14 bucks boom no big deal all
right we've got two more sponsors for
you today first up is actually James's
favorite sponsor yes
you use don't you I didn't tell you guys
took him away for this ad spot and now I
oh I don't have a pair at my desk
anymore oh oh you can take one back yeah
okay I think these are gonna work for me
which well which ones are yours do you
prefer that you prefer this one they
look better on me men come on these are
these are the kids once so spectrum
spectrum is the lineup of blue light
filtering glasses that makes it more
comfortable to look at your monitor all
day using a software solution like flux
or Twilight does not give you the same
kind of filtering that these glasses do
they've got lots of different styles to
choose from everything from like more
kind of you know these are the ones you
were wearing no they're not but I think
is a word really oh where do I work
these Wayfarer like thinner framed ones
cool all right so everything from kind
of like a thicker frame to kind of like
a more fun frame this one has cats on
the inside too even kid-friendly ones
that are flexible so that they're less
likely to break them they're primarily
focused around the Canadian and US
market but they're expanding to Europe
and they ship internationally and if you
guys check them out at Spectrum glasses
comm slash collection slash products or
at the link wait what dang it there we
go
or at the link below you can save 10%
with offer code Linus I think they're
trying to break into China eventually
here
you think so I think I heard that
reliable source are we allowed to say
that are we like disclosing in a sponsor
spot embargoed information from a spot
kind of stuffs are embargoed every
company while
go global you better not get it you
better not get us in trouble with like
your favorite sponsor I'm gonna get
kicked in the nuts you're killing me
here
all right moving on I fix it so I fix it
do they really need an introduction at
this point probably not but we'll do it
anyway hey Alex can I have that iFixit
kit that we were just using to complete
a project that we just did it's how to
promote vintage - there you go guys
I fix it they've got the guides whether
it's an iPhone and iMac a Dell computer
some other phone if it's a device I fix
it's got a guide for how to tear it
apart and sometimes how to put it back
together and they're also leading the
charge in terms of repair it yourself
culture because they not only provide
the guides they also have an extensive
range of replacement parts including
really hard to find stuff like weird
little adhesives or gaskets that are
required to put a system back together
and tools like yes my friends the Pro
Tech tool kit it's now only 59.95 and
includes their 64 bit driver kit which
has pretty much every bit you could
possibly need and a bunch of other cool
stuff for prying picking poking
anti-static King Thank You Bixby I
wasn't talking to you I mess with this
thing for sex what Bixby yeah no god
this thing um as a noob I have found two
things in particular that I like about
this yeah we actually hired a noob as a
writer like never built a computer
before this is kind of a yeah well I was
gonna kind of get to that but it's kind
of a funny story from his interview I
one of the questions that I asked every
interviewee was tell me about some
projects that you have on the go right
now so Anthony one of the other writers
that we hired at the same time he's like
oh yeah well I've got all these like
retro consoles that I'm repairing and
like soldering back together Alex tells
me about his like dune buggy like
creation from scratch team that he
participated
 probably shoots of potatoes up the
side yeah James is like I built my own
computer that's no that's not what I
said I said ok well well what do you
mean like building your own computer and
you said actually I would consider that
to be pretty basic
and I was like oh ok hope I make it to
the next round
yeah so somehow somehow you ended up
around here ok so given that perspective
I was blown away by the fact that this
puppy spins because then you can just
hold it in one hand and as you spin it
you don't have to reset your hand that's
that's just amazing there's so many
people face palming right now and to
love the week this puppy is the spudger
I actually you know what I'm gonna
confess they all got cool names I can't
remember which ones the spider I think
it's the black pokey one I'm pretty sure
that ever this is drawled I'm just gonna
give it a new name right now I don't
know I use this yeah this is the spudger
you're gonna get us in trouble with
every slideshow oh oh why do I let you
come on the show by I was talking to the
iFixit ladies at LTX and we were making
all sorts of good names for these things
this is a pokey anyway
this is great for opening boxes a lot of
people who work you just have not like
knives on their key chains like lioness
does Tyler does they unbox things all
day I haven't got to that level yet cuz
I'm a minimalist on my keychains I
actually have a separate keychain just
for my car key and the key that unlocks
this office that way on the weekend I
don't have to have those extra two keys
that's how much I hate things being in
my pocket so this thing is awesome for
just opening up new box of fans love it
totally worth the price of admission all
right well I'm sure that most of you
will find over at ifixit.com slash line
at 60 bucks I'm sure most of you will
find more complex things to work on with
that speaking of working on complex
things Alex are you done with that or
you're done okay cool okay do you want
to come on and join the show okay cool
all right I actually get to go home
diddy what time is it oh wow it's 6:00
oh well I can't make you join the show
but if you want to then you can
otherwise I'll just sit here and be a
show all by myself
yep see ya good bye alright so Alex um
did you want to do they know who you are
I don't know if they know here I think
some of them totally here yeah alex is
alex is a Toronto Blue Jays fan
apparently I actually didn't watch
baseball when they get into playoffs yes
okay so here a typical so here a typical
Canadian baseball fan yeah it's like
well we've only got one team and G 182
games is a lot to watch in a year so
yeah yes yeah I'd say the same about
hockey but being a Toronto fan like that
I wouldn't watch a game in like the past
20 years so are you a Toronto fan yeah
what if the closest team but y'all is
the closest team much rosy although not
to mention that like anyone else is the
closest team to being worthy of your
fandom I mean that's a factor as well
they're just for Anto I don't know I
wanted to be a rebel
everyone in my household is a Montreal
fan and I was just like you know what no
I'm being a Toronto fan and stirred
things up all right well speaking of
fans these are these CPUs are definitely
going to need fans because they have a
lot of course I've still got it baby
so this is posted by Ezzy on the forum
and the original art attack is a heart
attack articles from over on a non tech
Intel launches Xeon w CPUs for
workstations so there's some good news
here
the good news is I guess that now on the
workstation you can get support for up
to 512 gigs of ECC so that's error
correcting memory it goes all the way
from four cores to 18 core aligned to 18
cores and the xeon w family so i guess
that's cool
extent
so extended memory support vPro Intel's
AMT standard reliability serviceability
and availability features so it's good
in that there's like a higher-end
workstation platform but it's kind of
sucky in that basically intel has gone
from quite a few generations ago where
LGA 775 and 771 were pretty much a
little piece of tape apart and you could
kind of like mod one to the other and
you could pretty easily run sort of
workstation chips and in mainstream
boards and vice versa - now this
requires an all-new chipset and we've
got sort of their their Enterprise
Server Zeon's we've got consumer and
then we've got this in-between and
there's not a lot of interchangeability
in spite of the fact that there's really
no compelling reason for why that would
have to be physically yeah like 1366 you
could just take an i7 and plop in and
xeon and like it wouldn't even matter
right yep in fact I mean running server
grade processors in consumer
motherboards is something that I have
personally done like back in the day
with my Opteron 165 on socket 939 the
great thing about the operon 165 is that
it was it was a good value because it
ran at a super low clock speed but by
putting it in a consumer board you could
overclock the stuffing out of it and you
could get great performance per dollar
this is just artificially locking down
the performance per dollar that's
available and just you know there you go
with that said I don't think there's
really any I think it's like okay I
guess Intel's other behavior over the
last little while has made it less of a
factor because it's not like anything
that's not an X or a case Q is
overclockable anyway and these chips are
going to come in more expensive than the
equivalent core I nines anyhow so there
would be other than the second-hand
market no compelling reason to go and
buy one of these if you don't need ECC
memory support when also there's not
they just have
is it functionally any different than i9
or they're just locking you out in many
different ways for different markets no
it actually really doesn't look that
different so if you go ahead and have a
look at the lineup here and let's go
ahead and go down so here you go here's
how they're differentiating it there's
expert zeon scalable so this the
equivalent used to be the e5 2600 so
this is what we would have used for
projects like seven gamers one CPU in
like dual socket motherboards that kind
of thing
Zeon W is what would have been be five
sixteen hundred and then Xeon e3 is
entry so this would probably be what
would have previously been like LGA 1150
eleven 5x is eons where you don't
actually get like the quad channel
memory or anything like that you just
get ECC so avx-512 acceleration yep okay
so yeah pretty much you get a for a
couple four cores a couple six cores and
eight to ten fourteen and an eighteen
one thing I don't know is how these base
frequencies and turbo frequencies
compared to the core I nines and pricing
is still unclear but what we can at
least kind of figure out is that this
looks pretty darn similar to the 7900 X
and it is another four hundred and forty
dollars for pretty much those you know
enterprise features an ECC memory well
in fairness the and you don't get
overclocking anymore I'm assuming 2125
actually doesn't look that horrible yeah
but why would you buy a quad core at
four hundred dollars this is basically
what a what how much is a seventy seven
hundred seventy seven forty K right and
the seventy seven forty K can be had for
cheaper than that and it's overclockable
and I wouldn't run out and invest in
this kind of like the LGA 2066 platform
for a quad-core processor that's just
like kind of dumb yeah it's like not too
bad if you're in a situation that you're
never going to have yeah
so that's kind of where we're at on that
actually oh this is cool so Ian from a
non tech went ahead and did a little
comparison chart here so 70 that here's
a comparison between the top skews on
each platform so the super high end one
which actually now gets a new socket so
that allows it to have more course more
PCIe threat up excuse me no no more PCIe
lanes but far more cores up to 28 cores
and 56 threads and six channel memory
that one's gonna cost you anywhere from
10 to 13 thousand dollars from the price
eighty one eighty and then on the sort
of the high-end workstation / high end
desktop platforms you're looking at two
thousand dollars TBD but if i had to
guess i'd probably say around three
grand or 3500 you get a few more PCIe
lanes so the same as the very high-end
Zeon's and then you get very similar
clock speeds actually a little bit more
on boost a little bit less on base and a
lower TDP and then more memory support
and registered memory support so yeah I
can I guess that's a thing why don't we
move on yeah what are we still on Intel
yeah core i7 8700 K benchmarks have been
leaked this was posted originally on the
forum by I'm not sure james forgot to
forgot to put that in I wish I had
gotten to this one when he was here this
was posted by Raven Shrike on the forum
and the original article here is from w
CCF Tech goodness so this is a really
really interesting chip because word on
the street according to you know the
leaked box art here and the leaked
benchmarks here is that per core clock
speed and performance is going to be
pretty frickin similar to the CPU that
it's replacing the 7700 K except that
it's going to have six cores on what
will presumably be a similarly priced
mainstream motherboard and chipset
platform 6 cores mainstream
I'm excited Intel ran out and finally
delivered us a high-end desktop platform
worth writing home about and then went
and made it irrelevant to the vast
majority of consumers for whom 6-core is
like definitely super enough only a few
months later it's exciting it's a great
time to be alive what do we got here
what are the leak specs so it's a 3.7
gigahertz base frequency with boosts up
- well the only really interesting one
is 4.7 gigahertz on one core so low you
think that's the only interesting one I
am going to argue with you
I think the 4.5 gigahertz - core boost
is actually more important with how many
games these days true are taking
advantage of - course that's the same as
the 7700 K isn't it yeah I think so but
the word on the street though is that
we're looking at a 10% IPC improvement
so this thing could show up and
absolutely kick the stuffing out of the
computer that anyone who any chumps out
there who ran out and bought a 7700 K it
could be like the old days where every
generation we had this deep buyer's
remorse and we felt like there was
actually enough of a performance
improvement to be worth going out there
and buying a new one so word on the
street is that it's gonna cost 350 bucks
when it launches but with a 10% IPC
improvement similar clock speeds so
you're looking at 10% faster right out
of the gate plus that it could be up to
50% faster in heavily multi-threaded
benchmarks and applications I mean this
thing could show up and be legitimately
like a hundred and forty percent in the
real world 140 150 percent the speed of
a 7700 K in something like video
encoding
and I guess also that's really bad news
for AMD because that's kind of their
buttery zone right now where they're
like we have many cores it is going to
put some pressure on rise and seven with
that said I mean AMD has shown a
definite willingness to roll up their
sleeves like like they're rolling up the
sleeves all the way to the point where
like you're so wide a my god roll up the
sleeves all the way to the point where
there there's no sleeves left anymore
when it comes to adding more course to
cpus just because Yolo and also they
probably have a lot left over like in
the tank Verizon like hopefully as they
continue to improve it will see just
generally it being better well when when
Jim Keller left AMD so he left for Tesla
if I recall correctly so he left AMD to
go to Apple then he left Apple to go
back to AMD to like rescue them as far
as I can tell and then left to go to
Tesla AMD made it very clear that his
departure did not mean the end of the
Zen architecture and Zen 2.0 is already
mapped out is my understanding so we
already went through that topic we
already went through that topic we
already went through that topic Oh
Galaxy Note 7 owners will apparently get
a massive discount on the node eight so
that's cool
goodbye neck bye Nick oh I was so upset
about this topic this is supposed to buy
mini beats on the forum the original
article here is from PC gamer you guys
should go check it out are you upset by
that one I'm upset because it never got
released
I liked the Nvidia shield portable
really and a prototype
alright choose your choose your words
carefully
mister enjoys being employed here I just
never really saw the appeal of it what's
not to like it's a it's a handheld
console that plays android games and
that streams your pc games so android
games are never great and pc games are
only best played on a PC
what about pc platformers yeah what
about okay I played through all of Tomb
Raider on the Nvidia shield whole game
never felt like I was having a bad
experience and the graphics were
freaking awesome because it's a portable
platform okay but and you cannot enjoy
Tomb Raider at all I like played a bit
if it was like yeah yeah they're fine
GTA 5 who cares
any game that plays well with a
controller played great on the shield
portable and basically yeah they this
prototype which looks like it has some
seriously awesome improvements smaller
bezels that was like one of the only
things that I really felt like had to be
fixed they changed some of the button
placements it looks a bit more ergonomic
ah man just one prototype made it into
the wild and that's it I even sent like
and I shield portable was something that
I would send fairly frequent sort of
pings to our Nvidia rep about like hey
when you guys like doing a thing that's
a new thing because like this kind of an
old processor now and they just never
replied and never replied and it made me
sad screen was apparently brighter shut
down instantly instead of taking a
couple seconds and yeah so I'm sad
apparently nobody else is sad yeah I
couldn't care less really well thanks
speaking of things that we couldn't care
less about actually this does seem kind
of important YouTube begins isolating
offensive content this week they won't
be able to run ads or and this is
interesting be shared on other web sites
so Google announced this in June that
they would begin isolating YouTube
videos that weren't directly in
violation of its standards but contained
controversial religious or supremacist
content so the videos that fall into
this category aside from not being able
to run ads or be monetized won't have
comments disabled and may have a warning
screen appear before they play this is
meant to curtail engagement and minimize
the videos reach so creators affected by
the policy will receive a note and will
be able to appeal the decision if they
feel like the restrictions are
unwarranted well yes first of all how do
they flag it because I know their last
rollout went horribly a lot of people
thought falsely flagged yeah so if
they're able to improve that a bit
that's an improvement I guess but let's
see how it goes is all I have to say
about that yeah I don't have high hopes
for that and always the other thing that
I was going to say about this it also
seems like it's going to have a lot of
people that are just saying like oh
they're just trying to like hurt my free
speech and then they might almost get
more shares out of being like my free
speech is hurt as opposed to just not
being no one really caring all right so
let's move on from that to something
completely uncontroversial
do you guys have the juice arrow news
did you cero news no no uh-oh I did hear
about this though I thought you know
what I think James specifically asked me
if I wanted to do sera news in here
oh they're shutting down um and I
specifically told them yes I don't know
how to spell juice arrow I think you
mean Jui but sure Ju I know he didn't
put it in okay so hold on let's go grab
let's go grab an article here here is
the Verge's article juice arrow is
shutting down apparently they're trying
to get bought so that's pretty cool
all customers have up to 90 days to
request a refund for their purchase of
the juice Aeropress regardless of when
they bought it
employees are being given 60 days notice
so like have you seen the insides of one
of these those it's like super
impressive to like level of over-the-top
engineering it's like insane it's like
they gave someone like their first
engineering job and they're like make it
the best and instead of them like doing
anything besides making it the best they
only made it the best it's like the
aluminum's like this thickens boss it's
crazy there's no purpose for it to be
like that and they must be losing heaps
of money but like if these are all just
going out if you're like a creator or
like you've like maude things just pick
one up like off the side of the road it
will like there's amazing stuff inside
of it fair enough all right here's
something uncontroversial equally
uncontroversial the Pico goblin the
ultraportable first fully untethered VR
headset their claim to fame for this
thing is that it doesn't require a PC
it doesn't require any cables it doesn't
require a phone nothing mind you I could
have designed the Pico goblin by taking
some double-sided tape and a Samsung
gear VR or Google cardboard and taping
them together because to say
that it doesn't require a phone and then
tell me that it's running a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 CPU with a 5.5 inch 2560
by 1440 resolution display 3G high-speed
connectivity doesn't say how much but
lpddr4 ram 16 gigs of emmc 5.1 rom and a
3,500 milliamp hour battery is basically
like telling me that you guys engineered
a phone and then glue the headset to it
actually sounds a lot like the specs for
the LG g4 specs for it every phone ever
with that said it's cheap so it's
available for pre-order for two hundred
and sixty nine bucks if you wanted a
craptastic VR experience because unless
it's tracked outside in right now we are
not there yet but where we are is at the
end of the show so Alex unless you look
like you were gonna say something no
okay
alright you roll in the out trail
goodbye people they can't hear you
there's music free they can still
hear us okay candidate yeah it's just
and some people complain no I kind of
like it g4 was 808 dude not even close
so yeah why don't you just get crapped
on right there is anyone actually care
what it's not creating processors though
oh yeah like they matter a bit but
