Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
Haswell system for unbelievable overall
performance this is a bit of an
interesting unboxing these are the meze
11 classics designed by Antoni amazing
and what they are are they are wooden
earbuds which sounds like sort of a
mixture of sort of super high technology
and like you know carving things out of
wood but there is a practical reason for
using wood as a material to make audio
products so the objective here was to
deliver a very warm natural sound with
earbuds that have a style that really
can't go out of style so inside the box
you find not a whole lot other than a
carrying case which is great because
personally I actually am guilty of doing
this I carry my headphones in my pocket
with no carrying case at all and that's
an easy way for them to get damaged so
we're gonna go ahead and sort of assume
that a carrying case that'll easily fit
in your pocket is something that you
could easily carry around with you
packaging wise meze doesn't say too much
about these handcrafted
evany wood chamber reproducing crisp but
warm natural sound okay dedicated eight
millimeter neodymium drivers Wow
incorporate microphone looks like
they're missing an eye they're
compatible of iPhone iPod mp3 and before
it comes with three sizes of soft
silicone earbuds in an Eva case for
carrying okay so sensitivity 101 + - 2
decibels impedance so we're missing an
eye again look at that 14 ohms the
frequency response 16 Hertz - 24 kilo
Hertz and read it in from power few
megawatts ok this other packaging isn't
the greatest thing in the world but
quite frankly I don't care about
packaging very much as long as the
headphones themselves are freaking
awesome and from my from my research
about these headphones and my level of
excitement about checking them out I am
expecting them to be freaking awesome
everything that I'd seen about them
already indicated that they were great
and then Logan from Texan to get posted
his review the other day
indicating that they were great and that
is from an audio recorders perspective
not an audio recorder like one of these
but an audio recorder like someone who
composes and records audio so Logan has
some pretty cool some pretty cool tracks
that he does and he was saying that he
was using these and didn't even realize
that he was using earbuds which he
normally doesn't prefer to use so that
is that is a very very strong statement
indeed so the headphones the earbuds
themselves look absolutely fantastic I'm
maybe I don't know if this makes me like
a hipster or whatever then it is what it
is but I mean the look of natural wood
grain on a product is not beatable by
any kind of artificial any kind of
artificial finish that you can put on it
so at the back you've got a simple meze
logo there's a little hair on it and
there we go it's gonna come off come on
there we go yes okay you've got a simple
little meze logo then you've just got a
beautiful naturally finished wood green
followed by what appears to be that must
be plastic and there's that massive 8
millimeter driver so 8 mill drivers are
going to be able to just deliver just
plain more sound particularly bass to
your ears than smaller drivers would
what I'm expecting about these based on
that is that they're not going to fit
really deep inside the ear canal like
something like a SteelSeries flux in ear
does but they'll fit more around sort of
the the opening of the ear canal so I'm
expecting to wear the medium size tips
and it looks like that's going to be
about right for me now they don't stick
out super far but they also don't sit
really flush inside the ear like the
SteelSeries flux in your pros do with
their more hearing aid based shape the
ear sides are clearly marked this I
actually appreciate because when you're
looking around for them in the dark
particularly with earphones that don't
feel that different up at the top it's
nice to have those clearly labeled
however due to the integrated microphone
you can also use that to find which
one's left the mic is always on the left
from my experience so there you go
there's an integrated microphone that is
very very very simple if there was
anything I had to
playing about with these headphones it
would probably be the construction of
the microphone it feels a little bit on
the sort of not that fantastic side but
it's not the end of the world I wouldn't
expect to be using it much it's got a
simple button for taking calls and all
that but there you have it and again
based on Logan's review the recording
quality of a microphone is actually not
bad at all the court itself is braided
so you shouldn't have to worry too much
about it being damaged by cats or other
critters that might want to well
damage it and then up at the top we've
got a bit of a unique shape to the jack
so rather than going with a straight
jack or with a right angle Jack it looks
like Ms a has hedged their bets a little
bit and gone with a 45-degree angle Jack
which should in theory be 45 degrees as
opposed to not being 45 degrees noise
isolation is already outstanding I
forgot that when I plug things into my
phone my music starts immediately so I
can't hear a bloody thing I'm saying
right now hopefully it's all coherent I
think that pretty much wraps it up thank
