West 2016 check out their stealth laptop
in the video description down below
today at Coolermaster we're checking out
the mastercase pro 3 before we saw the
master case maker 5 this is smaller this
is a micro ATX system there's 5
expansion slots this top cover area is
pretty cool you can lift up the top a
little bit and it reveals the filter if
you want a little bit more airflow or
slide this completely off and you can
reveal everything under net even the
radiator bracket is removable that all
ties into the idea of the maker series
pots the the the freeform modular system
customize adjust upgrade as they show on
the board right by my freaking head
that's what all this kind of stuff is
about fair warning however this is not
the configuration that it will be in
when you buy it this side panel looks
amazing yes it's tempered glass blah
blah blah it like holds itself in with
the lock at the top which is super cool
but it will come with something more
like this not exactly this because this
is for the maker 5 so it's a little bit
too large for this case but there's a
little black bracket on the bottom which
you can actually remove using some
screws but the reason why that is there
is because you can see the power supply
here and you can add this basement cover
in yourself it comes by default in the
case but you can remove it if you want
and then that would create a full
basement for you if you have the
tempered glass system you would be able
to keep the basement top cover on but
you wouldn't have the side but if you
have a pretty power supply it's probably
fine using the click and clip rail
system on the right hand side in this
version of a setup you can see they have
GPU supports installed if you move that
rail just a little bit over you can use
the two included harddrive base wonders
which holds three hard drives the other
one holds two hard drives in terms of
SSD compatibility you can install two of
them on top of this basement cover
thingy
and one on the back of the motherboard
tray for i/o on the front it has two USB
3.0 ports a headphone and microphone
jack and a power and reset buttons also
something I forgot about the top there's
so many features on the top it also
functions as handles if you want to move
your case around nice and easy in terms
of support for cooling it can fit to 140
millimeter fans and
applicable radiator in the front to 140
millimeter fans and applicable radiator
in the top and a 1 140 millimeter fan
and applicable radiator in the back and
all those who could also do 120 s if you
wanted just in case anyways guys very
reminiscent of the master case maker 5
so if you are a fan of that case but
wanted a smaller system maybe a micro
ATX system this might be the way to go
