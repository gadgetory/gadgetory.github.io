probably all been through this at least
once we get all wrapped up like planning
and building a sick new gaming rig and
we're like super excited and then we
realize as we're plugging it into all of
our old peripherals that maybe it would
have been wise to save some of our
budget
to upgrade the rest of the experience
oops so today's video is gonna be
something a little special we are going
to be attempting to take this broken
monitor which we got on eBay today for a
hundred and twenty dollars and make it a
fully functional Horus a d20 7qd which
is a 600 u.s. dollar monitor new with
this replacement panel that we also got
on eBay well that one was Aliexpress Oh
what would you say our success chances
are today they're either like 100
percent or it just doesn't work it's
like all or nothing
speaking of all or nothing check out

monitors get broken in transit all the
time and because their housings and
stands are typically made from
reasonably robust materials the most
common thing could die is the panel
itself I've actually had it happen where
a monitor like tipped over in its box I
took it out and boom gigantic crack
across the screen
so finding broken monitors on sites like
eBay is actually usually as simple as
searching gaming monitor for parts or
broken or damaged gaming monitor and you
should have a whole bunch to choose from
now we went with this one for a couple
of reasons number one is that it's a
pretty darn nice monitor we actually
reviewed it a while back it's only three
think but it's one of the few free sink
models that Nvidia actually signed off
on as a g-sync compatible so it's a
pretty no compromises experience and
it's got a bunch of great features 2560
by 1440 resolution HDR support 1
millisecond response time what else is
it got IPS panel it's a pretty sick
monitor especially for a hundred and
twenty bucks now should we fire this
thing up and see what happens sure I
can't think of any reason not to might
as well just make sure that it is broken
maybe we've got a working monitor 420
bucks so once you find a broken monitor
that you like on eBay I'd recommend
finding that you can actually get the
panel that you want before pulling the
plug obviously so go on something like
panel look and search your monitor model
number and then you'll be able to find
the panel number which you can then put
into Aliexpress or somewhere similar and
find out how expensive that's going to
be to get a chip to you I'd recommend
getting something from Acer Asus or LG
they seem to be the easiest ones to get
panels for Samsung I just had no luck
for it all same with Alienware how lucky
are you feeling today in this situation
like zero
[Laughter]
just powered on seems to be seems to be
powered on it's detected so and it's
correct yeah yep that's definitely
broken
that's a crackin actually since we have
it here sanity check nope
Stan seems to be just fine no this is
actually like a super decent monitor so
it's been a while but I think with these
no bezel ones you can't have to pry this
up is that right do you know how to
disassemble this no I couldn't find
anything on disassembly it is pretty new
the good news is we don't really have to
worry about yeah careful with it yeah
oh I'm making progress you want a real
man screwdriver nope I don't think
that's such help oh here we go
that sounded like a couple clips broke
but they're broken then engaged hey it's
really in there maybe it doesn't need to
come out like when we're done if you're
able to use the menu that would be
pretty great I think they're just really
really big clips
hey nice now it's coming out trust us
for professionals we've got some some
attachment doodads here what are they
called again
no means yeah now I'd give that a sold
like c-plus for cable roading so now
things should get a little bit simpler
we've just got a handful of screws to
remove I mean is this the point where we
should pop out our replacement panel and
see if it even physically looks like it
might go in here yeah okay I think I get
more concerned than you because I'm
typically the one paying for them well
like the idea of this was that in the
end I just want to buy it
oh really so oh so we're building your
monitor right now basically yes oh wow
how'd you pull that scam off that was
literally like the entire idea for the
video just like I'm too cheap to buy a
monitor so this looks this looks really
close yeah that looks right so this one
guys we're only laying it down like this
because it does have a protective
covering on it but this little piece of
the housing here looks identical this
PCB looks the same all these mounting
points look the same I'm not saying that
makes this a guarantee I'm just saying
that makes our chances a lot better than
if they weren't the same okay so as long
as this is functional this should work
now some of this stuff we don't even
have to detach necessarily actually how
is that even attached it's just taped on
that's pretty typical Oh oh yeah I know
right really I know cuz it has like
mounting holes on it no no that I've
seen this before I swear huh
doing the research for this I was
actually shocked at how simple it is to
just make your own monitor maybe that's
the next stage huh try to salvage this
tape if you can because there's no real
reason not to reuse it Boop okay that's
the part where if I accidentally bridge
some of these contacts because I'm sure
there's some pretty decent-sized
capacitors on the other side I could die
that's what okay you were paying
attention to where this was routed right
yeah that goes down to here so this
right here is the cable that carries the
data from the display controller and
scaler this unit here to the panel
itself so we don't want to bum this up
that's presumably kind of hard to find a
replacement for oh yeah so there's
pretty much no point removing this tape
from the plastic frame because we just
want to slide our new panel right in and
then lay the tape back down
yeah remember that LGA 3647 motherboard
you broke oh yeah that was rough
actually that wasn't rough had one to us
like the next day that doesn't make it
good
so that's it the training wheels are off
there's no protector on the panel now
yep all right that was relatively simple
I kind of wish we'd taken a picture
before we took everything apart but
honestly you should be fine okay so that
seems to be cable routed yeah this one I
think goes in here yeah get that lined
up just right so we can take down
there's a like a ridge here yeah it kind
of settles in there so I'm ready to put
in the other side of our ribbon cable
it's not too delicate of an operation
compared to working within like a
notebook or something like that yeah
maybe you could give me a piece of tape
to hold it down this has been too easy
I'm getting concerned
yeah well the same thing happened last
time we replaced a panel we just popped
it apart smacked it back together and we
were like okay so that's it
theoretically this is assembled now
should we test it before we bother
putting it totally back together I was
about to ask you the same thing I kind
of like the drama better if we
reassemble the entire thing okay I want
to line me up here Oh hold on I got a
few cables to put in yeah hook up that
RGB yeah those are really important ones
all right do you remember how this went
in I think it slid the the bottom had to
go in first right yes okay there we go
see how many of these clips we didn't
break actually there's not that many
Clips broken what are you even talking
about this is on here perfectly fine
yeah it's pretty good no one's gonna be
able to tell all right here I might as
well plug this in here since you're out
holding you hey is the panel on um yeah
it was briefly um can we put on the
stand yeah it's just like kind of
difficult
there you go okay so so far the RGB is
working both on the back of the monitor
and on the stand that's a good sign I
don't know that this has DisplayPort 1.4
so it probably won't be able to do the
full thing but that's fine we can go get
a gaming rig to test it properly if it
actually works how do I even display on
this there we go
see there's theoretically it's on Oh
could it be that there's more wrong with
it than we thought because I think I
just turned it off I mean that's the
thing about a broken product is it could
be broken in more than one way do you
know that your mini DP works it's worked
in the past let's get something else
what pump is this uh-oh that's course
there's new one yeah it's there hydro
excellent it's actually made of like
clear nylon so it's like super like
durable and won't stain and stuff isn't
that cool I got to tell you I'm having
doubts so I guess the moment we find out
if I get a monitor or if you get a
monitor yes yes just like that okay me a
keyboard Nelson so does this thing work
you'll be pretty unfortunate just have
like a cross here oh nice dashboard
one potential snag right now so we can
see it's clearly running at 60 Hertz so
we don't know if that's because it can't
run it more yes yeah I would wait until
I actually see it running not too shabby
huh all right let's grab didn't pick
somebody yeah it's kind of like the
second moment of truth right here so the
thing is guys just because you got a
compatible panel doesn't necessarily
mean that it's an a panel
maybe you got not an a panel no okay no
no no no that one was fine just a piece
of dust
okay black looks good so we want to turn
it green so we can look for something
like a a red pixel that's standing out
to us
looks good mm-hmm I don't see any blue
pixels standing out no dead ones oh
what's that
I think that might be a dead red pixel
bummer I'd say you actually did pretty
well here yeah yep I think you've got a
dead red summer pixel so he's got 1/3 of
a dead pixel on the whole panel and it's
not right in the center so one thing
that's also really possible here is that
the calibration could just be completely
off I'm gonna take the time to actually
use our display calibrator and put it on
here but for anyone else a pretty good
method is you just take a piece of paper
put it up there change the RGB values
and your monitor OSD and boom I'd love
to know if g-sync works though that's
interesting well it didn't pick up
g-sync compatibility what drivers are on
this it could be old actually
so one odd behavior is that I noticed a
little bit of fringing on the display
earlier and it turns out that it's
running at 4k even though this is a
1440p panel but then it knew to run it
at 150 percent scaling so everything
looked the right size but there's a
little bit of so there's some artifacts
on text so it doesn't look crisp we're
gonna get the graphics driver installed
though and that should fix that okay
moment of truth time here setup G seg
whoo all right freaking awesome so I
guess that right there is kind of why
this is a good idea as opposed to just
buying a cheap monitor because this is
in the end with the panel and
like broken monitor slightly more
expensive than just buying a 1440p 144
hertz display yeah the original plan was
we were gonna get the panel for closer
to like one hundred and fifty hundred
and eighty bucks sounds like 140 and the
whole solution was gonna be about three
hundred dollars but now what did we end
up with yeah so it's been like two
months the order was canceled three
times and in the end we paid more like
three hundred dollars for the panel so
that's still a hundred and eighty
dollars less than new for a very
respectable decent compatible gaming
monitor and what forty-five minutes of
time yeah something like that
well for the actual upgrade not the like
while doing all the research well the
research was pretty quick to the two
months of canceled orders on aliexpress
weren't too fun
so this is your new monitor that yeah
see there's good ideas for videos and
then there's good ideas for videos that
are also because I'm really cheap don't
include that I think that's fine that
looks good not bad not bad at all I need
a better guy do they have headshots I
think on those if you get them like when
their mouths open it's extra damage okay
