seems to agree this is one fast little
mother and in fact when the first
performance results started to surface
we found articles like this cropping up
all over the place saying that in
Geekbench in particular the iPhone 6s
outperforms in some cases the 2015
MacBook certainly an impressive feat but
as we demonstrated in this video here
where we water-cooled the 2015 MacBook a
part of the problem with the performance
of that particular device is that it
drastically thermal throttles so you're
not getting all the performance that you
should have out of it which led my
inquisitive mind to go whoa hold on a
second
is there potentially then even more
performance under the hood of the iPhone
6s what would happen if we were to water
cool it stay tuned
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup check out the link in
the video description to learn more
ok so first order of business then is to
establish a baseline while it's being
air-cooled so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna run Geekbench continuously for 10
minutes recording the scores each time
it finishes and then tracking how the
scores change over time as the device
heats up from being put under a
continuous load so we've got our first
number 44 46 boom let's run it again and
record that so this is gonna be kind of
boring to watch you guys can tune out
for a bit 44 24 so this is interesting
at a controlled room temperature of 24
degrees Celsius the iPhone 6s does not
throttle appreciably at all over a
course of about 10 minutes so yeah this
kind of makes the water cooling
experiment a foregone conclusion but
what the hey I'm gonna give it a shot
anyway so here goes
now while the rumour mill does indicate
that the iPhone 6s is indeed quite
waterproof I do not intend to submerge
it directly in the liquid because I
still need this iPhone 6s to work for my
review of aforementioned device so I'm
just going to be using an ice water bath
to maintain it at the coolest possible
temperatures and then I will be putting
the iPhone inside a bag and sealing it
up using my patented vacu seal technique
notice your videos suck today they do
Wow can the touch sensor work through
the plastic do you think ah look at that
it did cool so now we're gonna have to
do another 10 minutes of runs here and
we will be back 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 3 holy
this is really consistent 4 more runs
and then we are through our 10 minutes
of testing and the only real takeaway
here is that water cooling the iPhone 6s
makes it run ever so slightly like like
part of a percent more consistently from
run to run impressive so the iPhone 6s
basically when running CPU intensive
benchmarks anyway doesn't thermal
throttle at all which brings up a couple
more questions
is our testing methodology then even
relevant so in order to validate that
we've brought in some other devices
we've got the HTC One m9 featuring the
infamous Snapdragon 810 we've got the
Samsung Galaxy s6 edge featuring the
Exynos 7420 and we've got the LG g4
featuring the Snapdragon 808 this should
give us a good cross-section of other
devices to compare the thermal
throttling performance of the iPhone 6s
against I'm going to run these phones
for 10 minutes and observe how their
scores track over that period of time
this is going to take some pretty rapid
data entry in order to achieve but I
think the galaxy s6 edge is going to
come up first here 52:24 ok so as
expected the s6 edge with the Exynos
7420 fell about 10 to 12 percent over
time ok who saw that coming the g4
didn't thermal throttle at all and kept
its performance extremely consistent
across the board but the one m9 was all
over the map like all over the place
like our first score was higher than any
score I can find online anywhere for the
one m9 in Geekbench
and then hour later scores were way
lower so we're gonna do two things here
we're gonna rerun the one m9 I'm gonna
I'm letting it get back to room
temperature now I'm not running anything
and we're gonna throw the ZTE axon into
the mix also a Snapdragon 810 powered
device so that'll give us two different
data points for this and two separate
devices for Snapdragon 810 let's see how
that goes all right so it's clear as mud
now the one m9 didn't go as high and
didn't fall as low on the second run and
the axon started out much lower and fell
as low as the one m9 did on our first
run showing us if nothing else that the
Snapdragon 810 is all over the fucking
map as far as performance is concerned
which I guess isn't telling you guys
anything you didn't already know if
you've been keeping up with the fiasco
that is the Snapdragon 810 now let's
find out how everything fares in the ice
water so Brandon asked a great question
off-camera about our testing methodology
here does having the phone's next to
each other
affect the results of the benchmark
because of the temperature of the water
potentially changing to which I replied
no we should actually be fine
because as long as there's still ice in
the water it will be give or take a
little bit zero degrees so we're just
going to load it up with the four phones
here and go ham oh come on now
everything just stopped auto-rotating
for like I guess I could turn it off
okay I think that Minority all our
phones are in the ice water so I'm gonna
let them all cool down be run
nice and optimally cold and then we will
do another 10 minutes of benchmarks on
all the phones in ice water all right
the time is now 1:16 we have four
water-cooled phones and we are ready to
go try not to get too excited okay s6
edge up first
55 22 wowza who's gonna be next looks
like it's gonna be the m9 wow that's
surprising 3901 all right 35 10 for the
g4 38 61 alright well we'll keep doing
this for 10 minutes 54:13 so it took a
little kind of staring at it I'm waiting
for numbers to pop out of the screen to
me but I think we've got some pretty
interesting conclusions so number one
the iPhone 6s is freaking awesome
running just CPU intensive tasks the CPU
does throttle if you load up the GPU it
basically doesn't throttle at all under
air cooling and what's cool and I can't
say this about every Snapdragon 808
device but I can say it about the g4 is
that it also gives 0 craps about whether
it is air cooled or whether it is in a
bag surrounded by ice water this puppy
performs exactly the same under all
scenarios for us everything else was a
little bit different it looks like the
Exynos processor and the s6 edge
performs about 10% better under ice
water and the Snapdragon 810 enabled
devices both the axon and the one m9
were a little bit all over the place but
if we consider our first one m9 run a
bit of it Wow the one m9 is actually
still a little bit warm even though it's
in water that is definitely cold that's
amazing so right so if we throw out that
first run with the
9 it looks like it actually stays at
about peak performance when it's in ice
water and the axon destroys its
air-cooled performance under water
across the board showing that the
Snapdragon 810 has a lot of potential
but that it has to be unlocked by some
kind of a design that can cool it
whether that's a heat pipe or water
cooling or whatever the case may be so
