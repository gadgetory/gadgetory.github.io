seems to agree this is one fast little
mother and in fact when the first
performance results started to surface
we found articles like this cropping up
all over the place saying that in
Geekbench in particular the iPhone 6s
outperforms in some cases the 2015
MacBook certainly an impressive feat but
as we demonstrated in this video here
where we water-cooled the 2015 MacBook a
part of the problem with the performance
of that particular device is that it
drastically thermal throttles so you're
not getting all the performance that you
should have out of it which led my
inquisitive mind to go whoa hold on a
second is there potentially then even
more performance under the hood of the
iPhone 6s what would happen if we were
to water cool it stay tuned
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup check out the link in
the video description to learn more
ok so first order of business then is to
establish a baseline while it's being
air-cooled so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna run Geekbench continuously for 10
minutes recording the scores each time
it finishes and then tracking how the
scores change over time as the device
heats up from being put under a
continuous load so we've got our first
number 44 46 boom let's run it again and
record that so this is gonna be kind of
boring to watch you guys can tune out
for a bit 44 24 so this is interesting
at a controlled room temperature of 24
degrees Celsius the iPhone 6s does not
throttle appreciably at all over a
course of about 10 minutes so yeah this
kind of makes the water cooling
experiment a foregone conclusion but
what the hey I'm gonna give it a shot
anyway so here goes
now while the rumour mill does indicate
that the iPhone 6s is indeed quite
waterproof I do not intend to submerge
it directly in the liquid because I
still need this iPhone 6s to work for my
review of aforementioned device so I'm
just going to be using an ice water bath
to maintain it at the coolest possible
temperatures and then I will be putting
the iPhone inside a bag and sealing it
up using my patented vacuum seal
technique notice your videos suck today
they do
Wow can the touch sensor work through
the plastic what do you think Wow look
at that it did cool so now we're gonna
have to do another 10 minutes of runs
here and we will be back for four four
three four four four three holy this is
really consistent four more runs and
then we are through our 10 minutes of
testing and the only real takeaway here
is that water cooling the iPhone 6s
makes it run ever so slightly like like
part of a percent more consistently from
run to run impressive so the iPhone 6s
basically when running CPU intensive
benchmarks anyway doesn't thermal
throttle at all which brings up a couple
more questions is our testing
methodology then even relevant so in
order to validate that we've brought in
some other devices we've got the HTC One
m9 featuring the infamous Snapdragon 810
we've got the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
featuring the Exynos 7420 and we've got
the LG g4 featuring the Snapdragon 808
this should give us a good cross-section
of other devices to compare the thermal
throttling performance of the iPhone 6s
against I'm going to run these phones
for 10 minutes and observe how their
scores track over that period of time
this is going to take some pretty rapid
data entry in order to achieve but I
think the galaxy s6 edge is going to
come up first here 52:24 okay so as
expected the s6 edge with the Exynos
7420 fell about 10 to 12 percent over
time okay you saw that coming the g4
didn't thermal throttle at all and kept
its performance extremely consistent
across the board but the one m9 was all
over the map like all over the place
like our first score was higher than any
score I can find online anywhere for the
one m9 in Geekbench
and then hour later scores were way
lower so we're gonna do two things here
we're gonna rerun the one m9 I'm gonna
I'm letting it get back to room
temperature now I'm not running anything
and we're gonna throw the ZTE axon into
the mix also a Snapdragon 810 powered
device so that will give us two
different data points for this and two
separate devices for Snapdragon 810
let's see how that goes all right so
it's clear as mud now the one m9
didn't go as high and didn't fall as low
on the second run and the axon started
out much lower and fell as low as the
one m9 did on our first run showing us
if nothing else that the Snapdragon 810
is all over the map as far as
performance is concerned which I guess
isn't telling you guys anything you
didn't already know if you've been
keeping up with the fiasco that is the
Snapdragon 810 now let's find out how
everything fares in the ice water so
Brandon asked a great question
off-camera about our testing methodology
here does having the phone's next to
each other
affect the results of the benchmark
because of the temperature of the water
potentially changing to which I replied
no we should actually be fine because as
long as there's still ice in the water
it will be a little bit zero degrees so
we're just gonna load it up with the
four phones here and go ham oh come on
now everything just stopped
auto-rotating for like I guess I could
turn it off okay that one already
all our phones are in the ice water so
I'm gonna let them all cool down you're
on
nice and optimally cold and then we will
do another 10 minutes of benchmarks on
all the phones in ice water all right
the time is now 1:16 we have four
water-cooled phones and we are ready to
go try not to get too excited okay s6
edge up first
55 22 wowza who's gonna be next looks
like it's gonna be the unbanned wow
that's surprising 3901
all right 35 10 for the g4 38 61 alright
well we'll keep doing this for 10
minutes 54:13 so it took a little kind
of staring at it I'm waiting for numbers
to pop out of the screen to me but I
think we've got some pretty interesting
conclusions so number one the iPhone 6s
is freaking awesome running just CPU
intensive tasks the CPU does throttle if
you load up the GPU it basically doesn't
throttle at all under air cooling and
what's cool and I can't say this about
every Snapdragon 808 device but I can
say it about the g4 is that it also
gives zero
craps about whether it is air cooled or
whether it is in a bag surrounded by ice
water this puppy performs exactly the
same under all scenarios for us
everything else was a little bit
different it looks like the Exynos
processor and the s6 edge performs about
10 percent better under ice water and
the Snapdragon 810 enabled devices both
the axon and the one m9 were a little
bit all over the place but if we
consider our first one m9 run a bit of
it Wow the one m9 is actually still a
little bit warm even though it's in
water that is definitely cold that's
amazing so right so if we throw out that
first run with the
9 it looks like it actually stays at
about peak performance when it's an
ice-water and the axon destroys its
air-cooled performance underwater across
the board showing that the Snapdragon
810 has a lot of potential but that it
has to be unlocked by some kind of a
design that can cool it whether that's a
heat pipe or water cooling or whatever

thanks again for watching and I have my

totally going to cheat
if you're looking for something cool to
watch we actually just did the manly
guide to cable management which ow you
can see the results for here actually
this is uh this fell off but whatever
there you guys get my point very manly
very much cable tidy by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
