most liked videos ever
I bought a surface pro 3 with the
intention of using it as a daily driver
machine but over the course of creating
this review determined that contrary to
Microsoft's assertion it was not for me
anyway a suitable replacement for a
laptop as a primary portable computer
and that having a stylus included with a
product without having considered but
not everyone on the planet has a front
shirt pocket in which to hold it is
absolutely ridiculous so I eventually
gave that machine away in a sweepstakes
a couple of months later but let's see
if the surface book Microsoft's clear
acknowledgement that I was right can put
a surface product in my hands
permanently
this review is super late
thanks Microsoft store so we'll just do
a lightning-fast tour of the device and
get into the usability right away the
charger is compact and includes a one
amp USB charging port awesome for travel
the included pen or pencil depending on
who you ask now has a flattened edge to
snap on to the magnetic left side of the
screen and it triggers Cortana when you
press the eraser along with some other
changes I'll discuss later
and finally the surface book itself
comes preassembled in its laptop
configuration which means that on the
top part of the magnesium clamshell
you'll get the following a power button
and volume controls on the top left
there a headphone jack on the right that
I'd really have preferred closer to this
bottom corner and a kind of finicky but
thankfully magnetic power input on the
bottom then on the detachable keyboard
slash battery / IO unit thing you get an
alternate power input mini DisplayPort
thank you for this b'bye HDMI it's been
nice knowing you
2 USB 3 ports and a full sized SD card
reader just right for a mouse a display
a USB Drive and a way to transfer to and
from a portable device even in the
wilderness Microsoft nailed the i/o on
the surface book which brings us to how
these things go together well from early
complaints not very well but Microsoft
has been surprisingly on the ball about
fixing common complaints like the
display glitching out when they're
detached and reattached and at this
point with the click of a button in the
system tray the device prompts you if
there are any applications that need to
be saved or closed then disengages with
a satisfying click that makes it feel
kind of like you know opening the
airlock or something like that which I
guess leads us into the piece of voodoo
magic that is the keyboard attachment
much like isus is famous TF 101
transformer the surface books base
includes a keyboard a touchpad and an
additional battery pack but unlike
anything I've had my hands on before
unless you count this thing it's got a
PCI Express 3.0 link to a discreet level
GPU a slightly customized GTX
940m with one gigabyte of gddr5 memory
by the look of things that gives the
surface book much more graphics
horsepower then onboard graphics would
allow when it's attached to the base
it's more for GPU accelerated
productivity tasks though you won't be
playing modern triple-a games on it at
the full 3000 by 2000 resolution of that
267 pixel per inch 13.5 inch IPS pixel
sense display that Microsoft has been
bragging about which doesn't mean they
shouldn't be bragging about it first of
all we can finally add a PC maker to the
list of companies that understand that
16 by 9 is not where it's at for
productivity and Microsoft goes even
further than we used to enjoy 16 by 10
all the way to 15 by 10 the effect is
subtle but it's just more comfortable if
you're trying to read or edit documents
and second then I was floored by the way
the black taskbar gets lost in the black
glass bezel and if you'd have told me
the screen was OLED I'd have probably
believed you for a minute or two
Microsoft says that they're individually
calibrating every one of these displays
and that it's got an incredible 1700 to
1 contrast ratio and I believe them a
few more housekeeping items the
workmanship of my sample is what I can
only describe as excellent the onboard
speakers are forward-facing and loud
enough for individual use in a quiet
environment but not like some laptops
where you can kind of leave them near
you on the dining room table while you
make dinner in the kitchen and the hinge
it's neat it shows really well in
marketing videos but frankly I think
lenovo's yoga Series 270 degree hinge is
a more elegant way to make a two-in-one
but let's talk about the to and oneness
then I'm not a huge tablet user in both
senses I own a few tablets because of
work but I almost never use one larger
than 7 inches because I find them kind
of heavy and redundant if I'm doing
something important enough to need a big
screen I'm probably
doing something important enough to need
a keyboard and the surface book didn't
cause me to have any kind of epiphany
about how wrong I was about large
tablets before it's shockingly light for
its size yet strong and Microsoft has
probably nailed the use case we're like
mom and dad are sitting on the couch
watching something on the TV and you
know junior wants to be nearby but watch
something else on a nice big screen but
that's not a situation that comes up for
me very often as a laptop the surface
book is pretty good my usual Cinebench
thermal throttling score showed perfect
scaling from run to run and even a
prolonged I 264 stress test at room
temperature yielded acceptable acoustics
and no thermal throttling this is the i7
6600 u 3 gigahertz dual core 16 gig
model guys well done Microsoft on that
point the trackpad is responsive with
perfectly tuned sensitivity out of the
box something we don't see enough of the
keyboard is a little bit mushy feeling
for my tastes but the travel distances
are good and the machinist is not in a
way that affected my typing speeds and
it compensated by being very very quiet
something a lot of people care about and
finally I think apples nonsense about
touch screens not being suitable for
laptops is just an excuse to make their
devices a hair thinner because I use the
touchscreen on the surface book in
laptop mode all the time it's just
natural to do it sometimes to be clear
the surface book is not perfect
the onboard Wi-Fi is terrible there is
no excuse for anything but Intel in a
device this expensive it weighs almost
as much as my blade 14 with much less
powerful hardware and this is something
I noticed especially when using the pen
to make little diagrams while writing
scripts and putting together shot lists
for videos there's more screen wobble
than I'd have liked but it is a huge
leap forward from my last surface device
the pro 3 well hold on a second Linus
let's just back up you wiped about the
pen in the surface pro 3 review what a
joke
why
you talking about how you used it this
time great question because this time
it's better there's little changes like
really you know low latency more
granular pressure detection it's got one
button versus two on the bottom now and
it's powered only by a single quadruple
a battery instead of needing those other
cells but the big change for me is that
it's actually carry a bull the magnetic
clip on the side is great I mean it's
not as good as if you could really put
it inside it but it it sticks to it like
glue it's freaking awesome it makes it
something that I can take with me places
instead of worrying about losing it and
being out sixty bucks every time which
leads us to the conclusion the surface
book stands out as a beacon of beautiful
elegant design among PC makers who
somehow managed to use you know high
quality aluminium materials in the
construction of their products but just
can't make them feel premium in the hand
unlike a product like the iPad pro the
128 gig model of which is closer in
price to an entry-level surface book
than people probably realize since that
one doesn't include the keyboard or the
pencil in the Box the surface book
actually delivers on its promise of true
laptop productivity in addition to being
a ginormous tablet I guess for me though
I just don't have much use for the
tablet part of it so whether it's worth
it to you is going to be a matter of
personal choice because what it amounts
to for someone like me is a really
expensive laptop but at least that's
more than I can say about most
first-generation devices and imo
Microsoft nailed what they were going
after here and are going to have a lot
of really happy customers and speaking
of brands that hope to have a lot of
happy customers watchable whoa what's
watchable that's a new sponsor Linus I
guess I'll stay tuned and listen to what
you're going to say about it washable is
a new free on-demand video platform that
just launched in the US that features
daily curated playlists from creators
and brands like vice tastemade GoPro and
actually even some of our content what's
interesting about that
well great question remember when
YouTube used to have you know staff pics
and stuff like that well it's kind of a
return to that instead of relying on
just an algorithm you can view watchable
content on your computer through their
iOS app and even on your TV through some
set-top boxes they want to be able to
watch more and search less with their
curated playlists so if all that sounds
interesting to you head on over to the
link in the video description and check
them out today but just please note I
said us a couple times for a reason as
the content on watchable is currently
available only in that region so thanks
for watching guys if this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or even consider supporting us
directly by using our affiliate code to
shop at Amazon instructions for which
are up there by buying a cool shirt like
this one we've actually got a holiday

if nothing else it's on the when show
that was from like November the last one
in November and I'm sure there are other
options as well anyway now that you're
done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so

card from AMD that performs about
between the ones that are priced higher
