either me or Luke okay that's a little
unusual but that's what's going to be
happening today welcome to my video on
the digital storm bolt three a pre built
gaming rig with an attitude as big as
its price tag but not as big as the
price tag of the machine Luke will be
showing off soon massage that like
button below if you want to see him
bench a computer worth nearly ten
thousand dollars fresh books is the

click on my face to learn more about it
let's get this out of the way a
custom-built machine would be cheaper
and it's pretty easy to do these days
but by the same token changing your own
oil is just plain not that difficult and
yet some folks don't want to get their
hands dirty so we'll be checking out the
digital storm bolt 3 from the
perspective of someone who wants a new
PC and clean hands now I've been
intrigued by the tiny yet powerful bolt
series ever since I first laid eyes on
one at a party at CES 2013 but it's
taken until the third generation for me
to finally get my hands on one for
review and a lot has changed for one
thing the bolt has put on weight at
about the same rate as a washed-up celeb
it isn't really that small anymore at
just shy of 20 liters the bolt 3 is 30%
larger than the silverstone Raven are
v01 and nearly three times the volume of
those custom steam machine prototypes
that valve was sending out during the
steamos beta but may be big can still be
sexy right let's take a tour and see
what digital storm has done to justify
their tiny beauties additional heft
starting at the front is a customized
faceplate that includes an RGB backlit
digital storm logo configurable through
software a slimline optical drive a DVD
writer for us and front Jack's including
audio and two USB 3.0 ports on the right
side is the side panel
with a curiously positioned air intake
and not much else to see other than
perhaps a better look at the black
brushed aluminum finish that says
irresistible to the eye as it is to your
fingerprints on the top is the first
hint that there's a serious business PC
inside with a grille that covers most of
it and two Corsair static pressure
series fans acting as intakes through a
filter that combined with positive
internal air pressure should do a solid
job of keeping most of the dust out of
this PC which is good because this puppy
is a work of art whose Beauty I would
never want to see tarnished by the
effects of age and the left side panel
with its full-sized acrylic window is
where we see all of that magic happen
perhaps now is a good time to reveal the
specs of this bad boy then there's a
custom liquid cooled and modestly
overclocked core i7 4790k processor on
an asus z97 i deluxe motherboard with 16
gigs of dual-channel ddr3 memory a 250
gig samsung 850 Evo SSD a 1 terabyte
Seagate hard drive a 600 watt 80 plus
gold rated modular silverstone power
supply a top-of-the-line gtx 980ti on a
pci express riser cable that enables its
showcase style mounting at the bottom of
the machine and RGB LED strips running
through the interior allowing you to
change not only that front logo but also
the lighting of the entire inside but
aside from listing specs what can we say
about this hardware well this mix means
all of the latest features 2 by 2 AC
Wi-Fi enough USB 3 ports to choke a
small mammal DIY grade flexibility if
you ever want to get into overclocking
or throw some significant upgrades at
the system with support for standard
motherboards and curiously even
quadruple width graphics cards means
that I guess my summary is this if the
point of buying a pre-built machine is
to have someone knowledgeable pick
everything out for you so you know
you're getting the good stuff without
putting any time or thought into it then
mission freaking accomplished I've seen
a lot of expensive computers with
proprietary motherboards questionable
power supplies and generic memory and
digital storm has avoided all of these
pitfalls even going as far as to provide
custom yellow dyed coolant for the
top-of-the-line swift Tec dual 120
millimeter all-in-one water cooler and
matching yellow paracord style power
cable extensions that give the computer
a surprisingly not off-the-shelf look
for something that wasn't built by the
owner which doesn't mean it wasn't
hand-built by someone I actually used to
work at a retailer where I was in charge
of the custom built computer department
and I think you guys would probably be
surprised how much work and care goes
into building something like this when
it's not being done on an assembly line
in China somewhere and it really shows
in the back you can see the custom
controller that digital storm uses for
LED management temperature monitoring
and fan control and you can also see
that they've got tidy cabling down to a
freaking science here in spite of the
fact that behind the motherboard tray it
will have literally no impact on
performance it's just taking pride in
your work
which I guess leads us pretty well into
performance doesn't it the big drawback
of compact gaming machines in the past
has been they're disappointing thermal
with throttling being a major issue
and/or acoustic performance with even
the bolt one with its 1u power supply
getting a little bit on the louder side
when under load and I guess that's where
the bolt three put on some well-deserved
extra pounds almost all the cooling in
this machine with the exception of the
power supply and graphics card is
handled by 120 millimeter fans and
thanks to the very spacious bottom
graphics card mounting area our gtx
980ti not only avoided thermal
throttling but turbo dup nicely and
stayed quiet even under load which leads
us to the conclusion I can do math just
as well as you spreadsheet warriors who
are crunching the costs of the
components of this system in Excel right
now so I'll save you the trouble with
some promos they have running the bolt
three costs a little over $500 more than
buying all of the exact same components
down to you know the included but
thankfully not installed McAfee software
the OS was actually very clean wire
extensions and water die and all that
stuff
and then putting them together yourself
and the performance wouldn't be
different so then what do you get for
your money the machine is
extraordinarily well packaged which
combined with digital storms QA means
that the likelihood of dealing with an
RMA or an incompatible component is
minuscule you get more than just a
pretty face with the components they
picked out for me being pretty much
impossible to criticize from a quality
or reliability perspective and you get
to just click by instead of tinkering
with it yourself for the let's be honest
eight would be conservative probably
closer to fifteen to twenty hours that
it would take for a relatively
inexperienced builder to piece together
all the parts themselves online and then
put it together
considering how PCMR showpiece worthy it
looks and while as a hot-rodder myself
reviewing a stock car off the lot isn't
exactly my wheelhouse if I try to think
of it less in terms of what I could
build for the same amount and more in
terms of the other things in my life
that I know how to do but pay more to
have someone else do for me like eating
out at a restaurant or the things that I
just don't feel like learning how to do
like car maintenance it just doesn't
seem nearly as outlandish anymore and
I'd feel a heck of a lot better
recommending this to a non DIY oriented
friend than most of the pre-built pcs
