processors obviously there's a whole lot
of motherboards to go with them and
while AMD has done a great job of making
sure that you can use older motherboards
with their six quarts obviously for the
best possible updated feature set you're
gonna want to use a new 800 series
chipset board so this is gigabytes 890
GPA - new t3h so the 890 G stands for
890 GX P I think is more like a series
and then a means USB 3.0 as well as SATA
6 gigabits per second ultra durable and
then three inch okay so basically
they've got support for all am three
CPUs including phantom 2 X 4 phantom 2 X
3 1 2 X 4 and phantom 2 X 6 all of that
good stuff you got support for crossfire
okay then you also have a four plus one
phase power design they've got
benchmarks on here for the onboard video
so because this is a GX chipset it does
have onboard video gigabyte it's got a
three year warranty and US and Canada
they've got a sticker on here to tell us
about that and then there are three
three three onboard accelerations so USB
3.0 USB power times three and what that
means is that every USB port on a
gigabyte 3-3-3 motherboard can deliver
up to three times the power so if you're
using a hub you can plug in three full
USB 3.0 powered devices without actually
using a powered hub then it also has
SATA 3.0 or six gigabit per second and
that is supported natively by AMD's
latest chipset on the back I don't know
that we've got a whole lot they're
talking about they're easy energy saver
a little bit as well as the benefits of
a two-ounce proper PCB so lower
temperature lower impedance lower EMI
better power efficiency better
overclocking all that good stuff okay so
let's have a look at what is included
with the you d3h here first of all we
have the user's manual which has a
utility and chipset driver etc DVD
inside
don't use this download the latest off
the gigabyte website also inside is the
i/o shield for whatever reason okay so
the manual is in
all English and it's about that thick
there you go next we have the
multilingual installation guidebook the
installation guide book shows you how to
install a CPU and CPU cooler Ram
installed a case and power supply
basically it's a little guide on how to
build a PC and it's in like 300 million
different languages here next we have
four SATA cables to right angle two
straight and then one IDE cable after
that we will find a couple of stickers
one of which is gigabyte and the other
is Dolby home theater that is it for
accessories that is a fairly bear
accessory package or for a board at this
sort of a price point important the
important value adds because this does
not look like a value board the first
thing you'll notice about it is that it
has huge cooling on both the Northbridge
and on the voltage regulator modules
which are up here so these are made of
what appears to be aluminum they've got
a heat pipe connecting them here and
they look incredibly beefy for like a GX
series or more value oriented board the
first thing you'll notice obviously in
the center of the board I already say
first thing I think I did second thing
you'll notice is this is an AM tree
socket means you got support for all AM
3 CPUs including the new X 6 CPUs you've
got your power connectors in there ideal
locations up at the top left for the 8
pin and then over on the right-hand edge
for the 24 pin you've got support for
dual channel ddr3 they're color-coded so
if you have a dual channel kit
you're gonna install it first in the two
blue modules and then if you want to add
another kit you'll install it then in
the two white
slots not modules next we've got an IDE
connector and what that's still doing on
a board it's very hard to say and then
under that we will find some more SATA
ports or some SATA ports we have 6 SATA
3 6 gigabit per second ports those are
the blue ones and those are running off
the AMD South Bridge and then we have
two more and these are running off the
gigabit chipset that's also providing
IDE support so those are SATA 2 and the
blue ones are SATA 3 ok
then we have our front panel connectors
for USB front headers so that means you
can run up to eight USB ports off of
these headers two firewire headers then
you've got a floppy connector of all
things and then moving on from there our
front audio I've never liked this
location for front audio I realize it
probably makes life a little bit easier
for the for the routing as far as the
internal wiring is going so you got your
ports here you got your audio chipset
here you got your header here but I
really do prefer it down here because
it's a little bit tricky to run that
connector over there from the front of
some cases either way it's so it's
usually doable so it's not that big of a
deal first of all first I keep saying
first of all I can't imagine why next we
have our PCI Express 16x slot followed
by another PCI Express 16x slot
this one however you can see from the
internal connectors runs at 8x speed so
if you're running two graphics carts
they're going to run at PCIe 8x speed
for both of them which doesn't really
impact performance anyway next we've got
three PCIe 1x slots and two PCI slots so
that means that if you've got two dual
slot graphics cards you've got access to
one two PCIe 1x and one PCI slot over
either on the back of the board you will
find all of our connectivity options
here we've got one ps2 keyboard / Mouse
port we have four USB 2.0 ports VGA HDMI
and then what appeared did I say HDMI
Wow I'm off today DVI and HDMI sure
enough then we have optical audio out
firewire Gigabit LAN and 7.1 audio thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
GA 890 GPA you d3h</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
