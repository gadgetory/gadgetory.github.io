its standard definition it's like going
back in time so they're going to be
having a look at the Zalman zem and see
3500 plus now the baby's sleeping so I
do have to be quiet I apologize for that
but there's not a whole lot I can do
about it so this is a premium notebook
cooler built in two channels USB
soundcard and dual amplifiers
it also has their enhanced okay so
that's pretty much stereo sound built in
stereo speakers a four by USB 2 hub and
a 220 millimeter or 22 centimeter
cooling fan it supports notebooks up to
17 inches now if you guys have a gaming
okay you know what let's finish with the
box first so an add stereo sound we got
that okay typical notebook we've got
that too maximum cooling performance an
ergonomic design cool this looks like
most of the same stuff that I'm a
careful design of the wave car that
moves having control buttons then panda
on/off mute volume down volume up okay
and so yeah if you guys have a gaming
notebook or you know anyone that has a
gaming notebook what you probably know
about them is that they run really hot
they tend to have big cooling fan while
too small cooling fan but there's a big
cooling fan somewhere I think it's down
here
there's the intakes there's the exhausts
big heat sinks and especially if you run
them on a carpet or on a bed or even on
a table a lot of the time they can run
really hot so what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be firing up a
game on this msi GX 660 are going to
fire it up on the table and then we are
going to use the ZM &amp;amp; C 3500 plus to see
if that improves
the temperatures of the CPU and the GPU
on this notebook
so let's first get the unboxing out of
the way so the sound of styrofoam very
rarely wakes up babies right all right
oh that was worse okay that's great more
styrofoam and of course shut down
correctly okay there we go that's cool
let's get the cooler out alright so
notebook cooler
there's your 22 centimeter fan right
there so it's pretty big right looks
giving you the nod it's pretty big
okay so you got rubber grip ease here
here here and here now there's a reason
that it's shaped like this number one is
you got speakers on either side
there's your volume control right here
on/off you down and up on your side not
a whole lot
at the back you've got a fan speed
sounds like bullying really again but
it's not so PC there's your USB hub so
that's feeding that and there's the
power in which will give you powered USB
and as well as power and potentially I
guess I guess the angle so the angle is
important on these things because that's
what actually makes it more ergonomic to
use for example slightly tilted down
it's more comfortable to type on and
you're sitting in front of it you can
always adjust the screen because it's
notebook and the screens usually fold on
notebooks just like this
okay so here's the laptop running on the
table we're just taking an idle reading
right now so the CPU is anywhere from 48
to 51 degrees GPU is running at 47
degrees so we've got a log running on
the real temp monitor for the quad-core
CPU it's in this notebook and we're just
going to go ahead and launch a game to
see what kind of temperatures we can
generate in a real world sort of gaming
laptop type of load so as you can see a
lot of games installed on this
particular computer out of all of these
I think maybe trying to is probably the
most demanding pathetic
there you go Steve needs to come on
I'm kidding okay well we'll be back so
we've been running for a little while
here that will give us some idea of what
kind of temps we're dealing with so
we're just going to all tab over the
quick CPUs at around 60 degrees and
let's check out the GPU so GPU peaked
around 60 68 degrees which actually is
not bad so let's go ahead and put on the
notebook cooler let's do it without the
fan first and let's see if running a
game we can actually get those
temperatures to changed also just for
our don't worry that's for yesterday
this is actually a sweet pen because it
has a light built into the other end of
it
fire pen my cards these are old cards
you can tell because NCIX has four
locations we're up to like eleven now or
something so yeah that's a little card
that I think one of these locations
doesn't even exist anymore the rich burn
well no that's the right Richmond one at
least that's pretty good that's a little
Avenue most these aren't building one
about maybe three years old so yeah 60
see this is like this is how sort of
this is our professional we are okay so
bear in mind guys I am not running this
with the fan on right now so we're just
finding out if having it raised having
the mesh underneath the underneath the
notebook is going to help with the CPU
and GPU temperatures versus having the
notebook right up against the table
bearing in mind the table is already a
pretty decent scenario for your gaming
notebook whereas if you're running it
like you know in bed or something it
would be great to have a stand like this
keeping the sheets from suffocating the
fans so we'll be back in a second once
we let it run a little bit okay so let's
find out what kind of temps we're
dealing with without the fan running
with okay so we're looking at now that's
a couple degrees cooler on the CPU
that's 58 degrees on the hottest core
and we actually dropped melt GPU looks
like it's running about the same at 68
degrees so now what we're going to do is
we're going to fire the game back up
okay that running again remember we're
getting low temperatures here guys
that's kind of an idea because really
you don't need a notebook cooler if
you're just going to be idling and are
you kidding me see these are high
profile plugs so what that means is that
if your USB ports are right next to each
other that won't work so you're going to
go ahead and separate those out a little
bit which I'm going to turn that thing
right up to max so uh yeah you can see
the Fed is spinning now although pretty
quiet even it max is a bit of a tick
there I wonder what that's all about so
we'll go ahead and find out if the Fed
improves the temperatures of our
notebook and yeah so this is the final
test remember guys we were at about
sixty degrees on the CPU and about 68
degrees on the GPU we've left it running
for another five minutes or so and let's
find out if the forced air cooling
decreases the temperatures so it looks
like the room has actually gotten a
little hotter because that's the only
explanation I can think of for why the
GPU maxed out at 69 this time and the
CPU is running again at about 58 degrees
so what it comes down to with this is if
your laptop has adequate ventilation
already and you're not looking at a
scenario where you're using it on a car
bed or on other sort of fabric surface
sitting in bed this would be a perfect
thing to put on your lap but if you're
just using your notebook on a desk and
you don't need the ergonomic advantage
of having it tilted like this then
there's probably less of an advantage to
a notebook cooler then you might have
actually thought now we're going to test
the sound really quickly here as well
right
okay so basically after after our short
test you know listening to some whoops
oh yeah is that how you say that I don't
even know but at any rate what we
concluded is that the speakers built
into the notebook cooler are definitely
louder than the ones built into this
particular notebook however maybe it's
due to the fact that MSI implemented
their Dynaudio sound system with this
particular notebook which means it does
actually have really good speakers
compared to most laptops the sound
quality was significantly better than
the ones that are built into the
notebook cooler part of that could be
not even
do with the speakers that they're using
or the sound chipset but just due to the
way that the speakers are covered by
this by this plastic cap with only open
ports right here and right here I think
that might be and bring them and the
performance that they're delivering in
some ways so thank you for checking out
my unboxing the first look at the Z MMC
3500 plus from Salomon don't forget to
