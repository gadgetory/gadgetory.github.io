interesting things from shuttle this is
an NCI X exclusive in Canada right off
the bat and this is the SH 61 r4 so what
is that what is an SH 61 r4 exactly well
to shuttle XP see it has the h61 Express
chipset which means you've got support
for the latest core i3 i5 and i7 zhan
Intel LGA 1155 it supports dual channel
ddr3 1333 megahertz memory with up to 4
gigs per slot a maximum of 8 gigs so
that tells us it has two slots
it supports DVID it supports um look at
that DVI / DVID dual display support
that's kind of handy so dual display
support on a little bare bones like this
means that this will be great for an
office machine what else do we have here
in terms of the features and
specifications it has USB 3 which is
awesome given the value style product
positioning of this particular guy right
here 5.1 audio as well as a 250 watt
power supply - three-and-a-half inch
main use for expansion and one five and
a quarter inch base for expansion so
this is an X PC from shuttle that means
this is a bare-bones machine now I
actually did a build guide for shuttle
XP systems on my NCIX comm channel so if
you want to know how to build a system
in one of these then you can check that
out but I'm just gonna give you a brief
outline of what all you will need so
you're gonna need the bare-bones unit
itself as I mentioned before this ships
with a 250 watt power supply it also has
a bunch of onboard connections which
means it does have a motherboard and
finally as you can plainly see it also
has a case so shuttle bare-bones is
basically a case a motherboard and a
power supply that are all specially
designed to work together properly so
what you will need is a CPU
you will need memory you will also need
any expansion carts that you intend to
add to it and finally you will need
drives so let's go ahead actually you
know what let's look at the outside of
the unit a little bit first so the
casing itself is awesome considering
that this is a value unit this is an
aluminum of like a brushed aluminum
anodized finish on here that looks just
outstanding can you see can you see it
in the light okay yeah it looks really
really sharp and then on the front of
the SH 61 r4 we've actually got okay let
me just take that off there you've got a
nice shiny plastic piece and we have a
five and a quarter inch bay cover so
there you can put any five and a quarter
inch device that you see fit on the
front we've got our power switch and
then we also have two USB 2.0 ports have
headphone jack and a microphone jack
let's go around to the back of the unit
where we will find a ventilation so you
can see the heat pipes running up
through the cooler we've also got screws
for mounting the cooler to the back we
have two PCI expansion slots remember
this is a custom form factor so you get
two expansion slots in a very similar
form factor to something like mini ITX
which gives you only one expansion slot
next you find your 5.1 audio out one two
three four five six USB 2.0 ports
Gigabit Ethernet a clear CMOS button
check that out you got a clear CMOS
button on a value aged 61 bare-bones
machine from shuttle that's awesome
that's a great feature you got two USB
3.0 ports and this right here that is
the selling point so this makes it
pretty much the ultimate office machine
because you can use those two DVI ports
I don't think I've ever seen two DVI
ports natively on the back of a board
now this is dvi-i which means it has all
of the digital connections as well as
the analog connections you see the
little dots around the outside
this is DVID which means it's digital
only so this one you can use a DVI to
vga adapter this one you can't so what
i'd really recommend doing is using two
purely digital signals you're going to
get the best image quality the best
usability out of it and you are going to
have less eye strain and you'll be using
it to its fullest extent okay looking at
the inside here is our 250 watt power
supply so
not really much to say about that it's
got a single 12 bull rail provides up to
16 amps why don't we have a look at the
connectors that are available on this
250 watt power supply so we have pretty
much everything that we need including
the 24 pin the 4 pin which come pre
connected to the motherboard for your
convenience we have 4 SATA cables which
I would imagine is sort of too many
because I believe this the spare bulbs
only supports 3 drives so two three and
a half inch and then one five and a
quarter mind you you could throw two two
and a half inch drives and a three and a
half inch bay and then you would be
using all four connectors so there you
go we also have two 4-pin molex as well
as one for pin floppy and a PCI Express
plug so that means you could take
something like a GTS 250 or even a GTS
450 throw it in here remember a good 250
watt power supply is still perfectly
capable of powering a low-end
are like a low to mid-range graphics
card I wouldn't go throwing like a GTX
560 or anything like that in there
though alright here our front connectors
which are already plugged in now you'll
see this in my build guide if you watch
it but this is what's so convenient
about a shuttle is that all of the
little finicky stuff like the front
panel you know power switch which you
can see over here the reset switch the
LEDs all that good stuff is all plugged
in so all you really have to do is plug
in some RAM so you check that out look
at this even the SATA cables are
pre-wired into the motherboard and then
pre-wrote it up exactly where you need
them so you cut this one zip tie right
here oh no you don't sorry you don't cut
this Atty you you undo this right here
you plug these into the backs of your
drives and you're pretty much ready to
rock just like that you actually don't
have to do any cable routing on your own
other than the power supply cables which
are fairly easy to do and I'm clearly
trying to put this back all wrong right
now which is making my life difficult
okay and then all you have to do is plug
in the CPU so you take out the pushpins
here you take out the screws at the back
of the unit here right there and then
you plug in your CPU you plug in your
RAM you plug in a graphics card if you
see fit and you are done now as far as
the graphics cards
check this out for expansion on mic
value 861 bare-bones we've got a PCIe
16x and a PCIe 1x those are very good
expansion options you can throw a
graphics card in there you can throw
whatever you want in there probably most
people will put nothing in there because
this is more like an office style
machine as I mentioned before it does
support core i3 Core i5 and core i7
processors although because of the 861
chipset you are not going to have
support for overclocking so if you're
using like a K series processor you're
not gonna get the most out of that K
series processor with a little
bare-bones machine like this one you've
got a nice heatsink here on the vrm so I
wouldn't worry too much about any
cooling problems and you can actually
see speaking of cooling that the whole
unit is cooled by three heat pipes
coming off the CPU cooler into an 80
millimeter fan that runs and blows all
the air directly ok cameraman is looking
at the heat pipes there they are and
then that both that comes up to that
radiator I showed you from the back
which is cooled by an 80 millimeter fan
which draws air from the ventilation
holes on the side of the chassis
right here through the back of the
chassis cooling things like the graphics
card which is next to the ventilation
holes as well as the vrm and the RAM
which are also sitting next to
ventilation holes so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the FH 61 r4
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and also don't
forget to check out my video on how to
build your very own shuttle PC just by
picking up one of these bare-bones units
CPU RAM drives and that's pretty much
all you need unless you want to throw in
a graphics card as well hey check this
out I missed something you guys mini
PCIe right here so you can actually
throw a wireless wireless card in there
like a notebook wireless card also
here's another pretty cool feature check
this up so they're using a PCIe slot see
that's a PCIe 1x but it has an open back
so that means that if you have something
like a raid card where you're gonna hook
up only two drives or something and it's
a PCIe 4x you can throw it in there
it'll run at lesser bandwidth but at
least it'll be physically compatible
because you don't have that stopper at
the end of the slot</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
