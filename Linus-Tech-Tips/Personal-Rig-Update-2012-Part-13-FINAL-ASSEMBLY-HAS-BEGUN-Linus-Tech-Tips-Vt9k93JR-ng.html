the personal rig is in progress and I'm
really going to build it this time you
guys so I've got the case back from
mountain mods it's got a glorious black
wrinkled finish on it you can't really
see it too well in this light but oh
yeah there you go that's not too bad
looks just just beast there's a couple
small imperfections on the case but I'm
over it I've gotten over it so I'm not
over it but there's not a whole lot I
can do about it at this point short of
Reese tripping and then reap outer
coating the case which is probably going
to cost me around 500 bucks so it ain't
happening so yeah I've got everything
scattered like all over the place here's
my t-virus res there we go I guess I
could actually do something about the
exposure level there there you go
there's the t-virus res and my soldering
iron so I'm using that to solder things
like custom cables and whatnot there's
my tubing that I'll be using
there's my double sided velcro which is
freaking awesome
it's my backpack them the tools there's
some adapters so those are some molex to
quad SATA adapters that I may or may not
be using to power the drives
there's my front bay radiator so it's a
dual 120 mil actually it's funny my
radiators are about as spread out as
anything check this out
there's my quad radiator sitting here on
the table along with my MCP six five
five pump I won't be using that Luna
block so that's that's for something
else I won't be using that power supply
you through that's for something else as
well Acer notebook also for something
else so oh yeah this TJ 10 also for
something else so let's get into the
actual personal rig itself I'm still
going
oh I blocked all the light still going
with the XFX 80-plus Platinum 1000 watt
power supply for the main reason that
the fan doesn't turn on when the system
is not using any power like when it's
under idle a can really hear my
breathing in this mic I'm using a bit of
a different mic setup so bear with me
here guys the raid card down there you
can see the cables are being routed
behind the motherboard tray like I had
planned the Asus zonar card actually has
a custom sleeved connector on it so this
is a
here we go for pin molex that I've
sleeved using MD PCX it's leaving so
it's extremely clean looking can't see
any color not that there is any color so
it's leaving they're making Kate custom
cables like this as most of the work of
a build like this and I'm probably not
going to overdo it so anything that's
not going to be seen I don't think I'm
going to put this sort of level of
detail into it this is keeping with my
part of one of the themes for this build
which is that I'm not using individually
sleeve cables I'm actually leaving two
wires per cable for everything so the
here you can see the wires that are
going to the GTX 590 classified from
EVGA so that's again two wires per per
sleeve there's the 24 pin so if you
count them one two three four five six
two wires per sleeve again and same
thing up there for the eight pin now
this isn't going to be visible but this
is one of the digital temperature
monitors that I'm gonna be using from
the T balancer so that's going to tuck
back there so that you don't actually
see it so that's the one that I'll be
using to monitor air temperatures and
that's gonna control these fans and
these ones right here because those are
the ones that are really going to be
cooling the actual chips out here so
that way the the temperature sensor
directly controls the cooling in the
area around the temperature sensor
they're actually I guess I'll just use
the zoom instead of moving around so
there is the custom black wrinkle hold
down on the Apogee HD limited edition
gold-plated water block and the focus
isn't quite right yeah there we go it's
a little bit dirty so I'll clean it up
before I do the final build and those
are ballistics tracers in there right
now but those are just a placeholder
this painters tape is just to keep the
t-virus reservoir from getting ruined
what I do test mounts so it's gonna go I
had a few people tell me I was crazy for
planning to mount the PCI Express cables
around it so I'm gonna be I'm gonna be
going on this side instead so it's gonna
look a little something like that you
can see I don't have a lot of clearance
here but the SATA cables so I'm gonna
have to find myself a low profile left
angle SATA power as well to make that
even fit in there and then I'm gonna
have one of
have to rotate a little bit now one of
these runs straight down into the bottom
which will go to the pump which will be
in the basement on the build haven't
installed any of the five and a quarter
bay connectors are five and a quarter
bay adapters yet that'll come later so
those are right there I still have to
clean out my radiator so I'll be using a
10% vinegar 90% boiling water solution
and then most people just flush them
shake them out and then use them but
what I'll actually be doing is setting
up my loop my pump Meads to be cleaned
to so I'll be setting up my loop on the
kitchen counter in here and then I'm
just gonna let it run for a day with the
vinegar solution running through it and
then I'll just clean all that water out
so I'll just set it up next to the sink
clean all that water out and then I'll
do a couple flushes with distilled to
make sure that they're actually clean
because I know there was some some junk
in my loop before ah LEDs so I'm using
UV LED strips you actually won't be able
to see the one that's back here so
that's the only one I've installed so
far and the only reason I installed it
is because it's really difficult to get
at that spot once the system is built
the rest of them are gonna go here to up
here and then either one or two here I'm
not sure yet it's going to depend what I
can get away with without them being
seen the trick with lighting is that you
should be able to see the light being
thrown not the lights themselves because
they're extremely bright I may end up
putting one or two back here as well I
really haven't decided yet one of the
challenges is going to be combating the
blue LEDs that are also in the system
and that was wait were those coming from
what was the problem no I think the
problem was when I lit this guy up the
cathode in there makes the makes the
coil and the t-virus glows so bright
that it was overpowering anything that I
tried to do on the tubing because the
tubing wasn't as UV reactive as this so
I don't want to end up with a ton of
blue light I want to end up with UV blue
glow on the appropriate components so
that'll be the UV blue tubing the UV
blue fans and the UV blue t virus as
well as this UV blue cable though you
won't be able to see much of that one
because it's just gonna sneak in back
here and that's about that's about all
you're gonna see of it so the quadrats
gonna go in the basement dual rads gonna
go on the
front and overall it's gonna look kind
of like this although you can't really
get a good feel for it that's the light
reflecting off it funny like that there
you go the back will look kind of
something like that haven't really
decided if I'm gonna leave the sound
card in there or not because I have an
essence one that I'm gonna be using for
my headphones uh what else do we have on
here well yeah I guess I could show you
guys the back that probably should have
occurred to me earlier so this is where
the tea balancers going to go all the
connectors are at the bottom here you
see four or three pin connectors molex
for power this USB one right here I'll
probably unplug at some point but I need
it in there just to program it and get
it set up with the new profiles these
are double stacked so that's eight F 120
SSDs each one or 120 gigs so I was a
total of 960 gigs or something stupid
like that it's gonna be challenging
getting the power in there you can see
the sort of the breakout cables have to
be coiled around a fair bit so they go
here here here here and here and they
actually take up a lot of the cable
management holes that I made for myself
that are not actually stock on the tj7
but I think I'm gonna get away with it
because these can pretty much lay flat
here all I have to get is some more fan
wires run so I'll do some of them up
here some of them down here I have to
get one inverter in and I have to sleeve
this for the cathode that's inside the
t-virus and then I'll probably stash
that here or here so behind the
motherboard tray so basically all I have
to get up here is a couple molexes to
split out into the quad Sada's for these
guys try to keep wiring to a minimum
because it's gonna be a real challenge I
have to get a molex up here to power
this guy I have to have a molex down
here for the pump and then I have to
figure out how to run extensions and
then splitters out to where all the fans
go still haven't decided how to power
all the LEDs I might use something like
a like a three pin a block light comes
with Swift xh 220 water cooler where
it's like a 1 3 pin or 1 4 pin to like 8
4 pin splitter out so that I can run all
the LEDs to one place and then I'll just
plug them in like here and have it just
run everywhere and I'll just use
extensions to get it where it needs to
go so
cable management coming in handy so
cable management here here and here
we're all cut this time around actually
I think I had a little one here but I
made a much bigger one the motherboard
tray cutout has been useful if nothing
else for making the the t balance or
actually fit so for those of you who
don't know what a t balance or does it
controls all of my fans automatically
USB 3 upgrade on the front done this is
a fairly unique item right here it's
that LG blu-ray and kind of manually
focus here yeah there we go that LG
blu-ray and HD DVD player so it's just I
don't know it's kind of neat I don't use
an optical drive much but if I do then I
want it to be like a sweet hard to find
one I guess that's about it sorry for
the breathing throughout this video it
sounds really awful but I'm not going to
refilm it at this point so good night
