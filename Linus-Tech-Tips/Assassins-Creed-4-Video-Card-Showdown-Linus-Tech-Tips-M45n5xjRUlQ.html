learn more welcome to our Assassin's
Creed 4 Black Flag performance review
first off we're going to show you guys
how I ran this benchmark I like to fill
this bench marking around the torch run
if you can see right there I was
standing beside a torch and the idea of
this run was all my benchmarks are about
2 minutes long so I had to get somewhere
free running within two minutes so I
went to an opposing Beach on the other
side of Nassau and I made it about 2
minutes long and I end by another torch
which is I don't know kind of random but
I just thought it was cool I ended up
going with free running not just because
it was easy I tried a few different
things and one of the ones I really want
to do was ship battles because that's a
big part of Black Flag that's why it's
called Black Flag as you have a ship
called the jackdaw and I want to fight
in the jackdaw but I found that with the
wave mechanics and everything that are
in this game which are really fun um
they're not exactly very good for
benchmarking because they're not exactly
the same every time which is good for
gameplay don't get me wrong but not good
for benchmarking which almost no one's
going to do so that's completely fine so
I had to go something more consistent
though and I ended up falling back on an
assassin's creed staple which is free
running so I tried to make it a little
bit interesting by going through the
trees and stuff and then I do kill the
dude at the top of this watchtower but
that's honestly more of a necessity than
anything because if you don't kill him
when you get to the top of the tower he
will shoot you later on in the benchmark
and that kind of screws up your
freerunning because your dad will fall
so I stabbed him hello so climb up the
very top of the tower and then we do a
leap of faith here and what good is any
Assassin's Creed video with only one
leap of faith so we climb this one get
stuck here for a quick second and then
another leap of faith this one a little
bit more black flag oriented and then as
you can see there is one more torch we
stopped by that we have completed the
torch run the cards performed pretty
much as expected in this game
I noticed things like the NVIDIA GTX 770
was above the Radeon r9 280x and that
was not surprising because this is an
Nvidia title and I've noticed those
cards trade depending on which games
title it was and with no new drivers
from AMD that was to be expected
although it might change in the future
not entirely sure another thing you
might notice is that
godrays were disabled I found that
enabling godrays even on high didn't
lower the FPS a ton overall but it did
create inconsistencies in between my
benchmarks so each run there would be
too much of a differential in the final
number that was output so I decided to
leave it out because it just wasn't a
very good result at the very end this
game when I first booted up I didn't
think it was going to be that hard to
run because it was Assassin's Creed game
I was like I never had problems with
these before but cranking all the
settings it was really hard to run and
it's not surprising because once you get
in the game it's absolutely beautiful
the water is amazing the general
graphics around everywhere are just
absolutely fantastic if you liked this
video like the video if you dislike the
video dislike the video and in the
comments below what is your favorite
Assassin's Creed this one might be going
for mine but if I don't include this one
I'm thinking probably a SAS Creed tube
