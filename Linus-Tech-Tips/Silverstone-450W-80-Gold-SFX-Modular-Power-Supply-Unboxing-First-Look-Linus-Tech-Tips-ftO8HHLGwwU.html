the Silverstone sfx series for 50 watt
so this is the st 4 5 s F - G SFX power
supply so this is a small power supply
for cases such as the FTO 3 mate I mean
look how small it is Devore
look at this thing it's like the cutest
thing ever
see slick came all the way over here you
see you're supposed to be working slick
it's like half the size of a regular ATX
power supply fully freakin modular by
the way 80 plus gold by the way this
thing's awesome
it's got a single 80 millimeter cooling
fan back here which is fine because it's
only 450 watts and it's 80 plus gold and
it's fully my offense it's so cool ok
let's take a look video ok pick up the
cables comes with an SFX - ATX adapter
just in case you wanted that from
another reason although usually if I was
buying an SFX power supply I would buy
it to go of my SFX case let's have a
look at what they've got on here in
terms of specs Oh 80 plus gold is pretty
close to 90 plus it's like 90 percent
optimal so that's at about 50 percent
load and it lower it goes at the lowest
about 87 percent loads so realistically
you're going to get anywhere from run a
88 percent to 89 percent efficiency out
of it
power single powerful single 12 volt
rail perfect for high-end component
upgrades so yes you can run a real
graphics card off this thing
check that out one modular cable heart
look at these look at this cables
leaving I think this is the high in it
highest end cable sleeving I've seen
pre-installed on a power supply this is
outstanding you can hardly see the color
at all this has yellow cables but you
like you can't see it at all even if you
bend it all cuz things awesome okay
moving right along
perfect for blah blah blah yeah so right
so there's a six pin and a 6 + 2 pin so
you can put a high end graphics card on
it 100% modular cable design for easy
removal in a case with the cable routed
and tied down this isn't
important with those small and chronic
cases instead of pulling all the cables
out of everything to pull it out you can
just go let the click-click-click take
it out you know maybe even okay heaven
forbid you know knock on wood the power
supply dies and you got a horror man
this is a lot easier than undoing it
from everything especially in those tiny
tiny cramped cases plus or minus 3%
regulation and low ripple and noise
performance for eye stability this is
good these are all good things and where
is our actual spec here so 37 amps on
the 12 volt rail almost the entire 450
watt output can be done on the 12 volt
rail this is optimal for high-end
graphics card configurations operating
temperatures a zero to 40 C that's
pretty aggressive okay that's good um
and then right so let's have a look at
the included stuff so you got a 20 plus
4 pin connector okay very very short
cable I mean this is not meant to be
installed in a Corsair 800 D or all
rather I should okay it should be
talking about Corsair cases I'm looking
at Silverstone power supply here so not
for a silverstone TJ 11 for example
because it just would not reach okay
this is meant for small cases next we've
got a four plus four pin connector for
the CPU this one's a little bit longer
because the positioning of that
connector can vary a fair amount on
these on these small form-factor cases
it really depends like sometimes they'll
be here or here or here or wherever else
you should be able to reach it just fine
this is an adequately long cable for
that purpose we've also got a harness
with three SATA connectors and let's
have a look at the length of that one
I'm curious because I will be doing a
build with this power supply soon as the
fto 3 mini yeah there you go that's
pretty good so you've got you know
there's a couple drives that are next to
each other right there I like that short
run distance between them and then this
is like an auxilary one somewhere else
and then finally you've got a harness
with two molexes and one floppy
connector in case you still have it in
four pins in your case standard power
cable nothing to see here four black
screws for installing in your case and
the power supply itself so there's your
silverstone ud+ gold gold coloured
branding over here this test silverstone
stamped logo on the top
Silverstone really is probably the most
underappreciated brand of power supplies
in North America I mean they have
fantastic stuff like the strider 1500
watt was way ahead of its time with 1500
watts 80 plus silver which at the time
was a huge deal and fully modular like
there's nothing else like it it just
seems people didn't get adequately
excited about it I already showed the 80
millimeter cooling fan the honeycomb
mesh at the back for more cooling and I
think that pretty much covers it if you
want 450 watts of like power in your
hand then this is probably the way to do
it or better yet you could install in
your computer case don't forget to
