peripherals has the features you need to
win at a price you like click now to
learn more welcome to my unboxing and
review of a product that I can't figure
out the reason for its existence this is
the r9 270 from AMD in particular we
have the MSI gaming Edition with their
twin frozer cooler their military spec
military class design so that means very
robust components great for overclocking
and running cool and lasting a long time
and all that stuff as well as well
that's pretty much it the cooler and the
better designed PCB are kind of the
benefits of a gaming class card from MSI
alright so why can't I figure out why it
exists well because it's pretty similar
to the 270 X so it comes with a do 2
molex 2 single PCIe 6 pin adapter it's
150 watt TDP card so you only need a
single 6 pin connector
you've got some user guidance driver
disks and all that don't worry about it
alright so the graphics card itself has
a fully featured core which means 1280
stream processors a 256-bit memory
interface and the only real difference
between this and its bigger brother the
270x is the slightly lower frequency on
the GPU core so a reference 270 would be
clocked at around 925 megahertz
whereas a reference 270 X is going to be
at 1.05 gigahertz now with that said
this msi one comes clocked at 975
megahertz
anyway so the performance is very very
close and it costs about 10 percent less
now all of the usual features with the
exception of trueaudio are supported
DirectX 11 point to their new mantle api
which is going to have support in
battlefield 4 and star citizen and some
upcoming games coming soon although
we've yet to find out how much of a
performance difference that makes it
does have support for their new easy
Eyefinity so you can plug three displays
into whichever three connections you
want and you can even use a DisplayPort
hub to connect up to six displays to
this individual card although for a two
gig card with this kind of power I
wouldn't
really recommend running eyefinity 1080p
and expecting to play the latest games
at Ultra details the performance is
going to be everything for this now our
usual thing is we take the cards oh yeah
I guess we should do a bit of a tour of
the cards so we've got MSI 100
millimeter propeller blade fans so they
have the coating on the edges they spin
backwards in order to prevent dust
buildup and all that noise at speaking
of noise it's very very very quiet
then we've got some heat pipes down here
so we've got two heat pipes leading out
to a pretty large actually aluminium
thinner right so you can see that there
is a bit of a peanut PCB extension right
here so it's actually longer than the
PCB itself but for good reason because
they've actually got more cooling
potential there they've also got their
usual rigidity enhancing piece right
here that actually does help the card
sag and droop last we've got a crossfire
connector supporting up to two way
crossfire configurations and a gorgeous
matte black PCB on the back we've also
got a PCI Express 3.0 16 X interface and
the aforementioned 6 pin PCI Express
plug so you will be yeah that's pretty
much it ok so it comes down to
performance and price so the price is
better than a 270 X and the performance
once we overclocked this thing we got
this thing just absolutely Rocking
because it's a non reference card it
does overclock and it is cooled better
than our reference 270 X and we actually
got pretty much the same performance
with max overclocks on this card and the
other one so we're looking at something
like this going holy crap well this
thing's fantastic it's basically just
cheaper so this is why I'm saying I the
hold I don't know why it exists thing
because AMD is basically undercutting
the 270x by bringing this card to us
only a couple weeks later and it's
performed great so without further ado
I'm going to hand things off to slick
and he can let you guys know that the
performance is awesome with actual
graphs whoa hey hold on ok I'm back now
I missed something ok so they've got
their zero core technology which
basically turns off the GPU when your
system goes to sleep and the display
goes off so you can actually save a lot
of power that way not full sleep display
off sleep just to be clear and I wanted
to talk a little bit about our testing
methodology for our graphics cards we
overclocked every card so the cold hard
truth is yes designs like this will do
better than reference designs a lot of
the time but then the breaks I guess
is a lesson about buying non-reference
cards versus buying reference cards if
you want the absolute maximum
performance when you're overclocking you
can see all of our overclocking settings
in the graph and chart that is actually
linked below the video description so
you can see exactly what we're doing and
if you want to see stock benchmarks
there are of course 100 other sites
that'll have stock benchmarks for this
card so feel free to go and check those
ones out but we're showing overclocked
numbers in all of our games at 1080p
which is what this card is designed for
1080p sweet spot performance and now off
to loop it's like whatever his name is
the first thing to notice is that in our
overclocked benchmarks the 270 beats of
the 270x just like in our overclocked
benchmarks how the 290 beat of the 290 X
although in this situation is slightly
different because our 270 has an
aftermarket cooler where our 270x did
not so there's a slight difference there
for overclocking with this card o is
actually quite simple you take all the
sliders to the very end click apply and
you're done it's completely stable we
had a core clock of 10:50 the entire
time no matter what I threw out it was
completely stable and this was awesomely
boring it was awesome because you get to
just take all the sliders and put them
up the end which is always kind of fun
but then it was boring because it just
kind of worked and had no issue
whatsoever and there was no fine-tuning
or anything like that was just put them
all at the end and you're good to go and
only got a 63 degrees and the fan speed
only went up to 27% on the heaviest load
I put it on so it seems like there might
be some extra power there that I could
harness but it just isn't other than
that it performs really well and as
Linus said I'm not entirely sure why it
exists but I'm happy it's here so that's
about it if you liked the video like the
video if you just liked the video
dislike the video and in the comments
below what do you think about AMD's new
naming scheme and all these different
products that they're releasing with
very similar but different names and as
always subscribe to Linus tech tips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
