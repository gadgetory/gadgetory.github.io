alchemy premium ultra premium modding
series lights so these are available in
a variety of different configurations
and we are going to be unboxing one of
them no no that's okay I don't need that
that's how long it takes unboxing but
we're going to focus less on the
unboxing in this video and more on the
actual features of these products so
there's a few different things one is
that they use high-grade LEDs next is
that they are chainable we with the
insert the connect series is chainable
which is cool they also use a high-grade
adhesive which means they won't come off
like so many lighting products they just
come off terrible and are available in
multiple colors and lengths including 12
30 60 centimeters red blue green orange
and white I asked about UV because
personally I'm a UV kind of guy and they
said that not yet but they're coming
okay so we've got this stuff so it comes
with the adapter one thing that's great
about LED strips versus cold cathodes is
that they run directly off 12 volt power
here are the daisy chain pieces that
you'll need potentially so they give you
everything you could need okay there you
go is that they run directly off 12 volt
power which means you don't need a bulky
ugly inverter so it's much easier to
light up your case with clean tidy
wiring than it is with one of those
cathode device images so here we go we
just plug this into this thing
preferably oriented the correct way
which it does seem to be okay it's just
a little stiff 12 volt and then all we
have to do is either there we are
these are non gender-specific so you can
just plug them in either way doesn't
really matter
mmm and we just plug in like that so
hold on I'm gonna show you guys the
various links give me a second because I
actually grabbed one of the wrong boxes
what I originally have to do the video
it's like buy me some time here take
different angles on it
wait these are are these all 30
centimeter I thought I saw it 20
centimeter one what's their 20 side of
you Russian claims I took the 20
centimeter one maybe the 20 centimeter
one is the ah yes so the 27 meter one is
kind of a neat one so this is their
waterproof edition so this can be used
to light up a reservoir or do whatever
else you want see they how they have
caps built into the ends of them and
then they have a waterproof coating over
top of them so they will be completely
impermeable to water so yes you can
throw those in side water whatever kind
of reservoir you have you want to like
curl it around somewhere and you know
have the wire run out the top or do
whatever you need to do there you go you
know what we should do those we should
plug these in so you guys can see what
the lighting effects look like let's see
if I have a test bench plugged in no I
don't but I have this one let's see if
we can find a four pin peripheral
connector aha beautiful so here's I
always recommend installing lighting
such that you can't see the source of
the light itself and only the light so
that is what it will look like as a bit
of a before-and-after I'm just gonna
this beauty love LED lighting it looks
so much better than cathode lighting and
here let's take the oh let's try the I
think this one's a different color so
that's what it looks like that's how
much light it throws very impressive
Slick's six so pardon him guys
uh-huh I'm not quite sure I understand
how this works
yes I do you plug the thing into the
thing ah so that's the waterproof one
unfortunately this isn't the other color
that I had hoped it was okay I'm coming
back with another color wait I'll just
do a speed unboxing over here
while I find hot speed unboxing not
recommended for you no new one boxers
only experience pot unboxers okay then
we need to get these things which go on
to hear speed lighting for your face
speed plugging of the thing into the
thing yeah yeah there we go oh that is
an awesome red look at that guys
gorgeous blood red not some of the pinky
hues that you get with some of the
cathode lighting that looks fantastic
there we go I'll let you guys be the
judge of how it looks imma I apologize
for all the cables that are in front of
it like this so you can't really get a
good feel for what the Lighting's
actually like so it's more like that
