compensator - it's been a little bit
over a year since the original
compensator video was released and there
have been improvements across the board
in terms of CPU cores graphics card
performance memory speed tons of
different stuff and we have it all here
the idea of the compensator is that
there are no compromises in terms of any
of our components as long as you can
just buy them on a shelf and throw them
in your computer this video isn't as
crazy as it used to be because now it's
fairly commonplace for us to have like
30 or 70 or even more thousand dollar
computers but compensated - let's go
thanks the g.skill for helping make
compensator to possible check out their
gaming mouse and keyboard down in the
video description
I do need like gloves of some sort do we
have close that moment when you need
gloves because even your ram has brushed
aluminum on that moment when they also
don't fit 128 gigs of g.skill trident
and said or z whatever you want to call
it 3200 measures so on our last builds
we had the Lian Li PC o8 this is the lis
only PC o 9 so s we'll see how different
it is well the PC o 8 says that it's
compatible with triple rads it's only
like kinda and I have the same cooler
again so hopefully it coats better this
time oh look at those feet it smells new
seriously Fran
smell what ah there's no air intakes on
this side of the case so the Kelvin will
go up here I guess or right here this
looks pretty cool so just like last time
they have some included LED strips for
the dials on the back first I'm going to
remove these fans so I can try to line
up the cooler at all and then we'll go
from there
I want to thank fractal Josh I guess
real quick sorta didn't realize the fact
that we didn't have the Kelvin s 36
yesterday so contacted Josh and was like
hey man I need one of those literally
tomorrow and I mean he came through it's
here now I don't know if this is going
to work and run this back this way
now Brandon is Ella cool
with fan without fan next up I'm going
to remove this big drive cage which I
don't really need at least yet and then
I'm going to try to figure out how
you're supposed to pipe this water block
I kind of line down from that no one
would ever know I was thinking of
cutting a line right here so that I
could bring this up feed the tubes up
through the line so they can get up in
here hold this up vertically and then
install the motherboard cuz you know
what it looks like is that there like
there's no way anyone's gonna use an AI
Oh in this case yeah but then I did it
through that immediately yeah okay so
we're going to solve our little radiator
problem by cutting through our extremely
expensive brand new case
so my nerves are through the roof come
along with it not too bad actually with
some minor filing work I can maybe make
that look pretty okay okay that actually
looks pretty good not to like toot my
horn too much or anything
watch the tubes not fit through it
didn't really think about that part yeah
okay we're actually good so this will
fit up here and then look something like
that just in Reverse cuz it's me on the
other side of the case and that'll work
maybe sorta a little bit now I'm just
installing the fans because I really
want to make sure that this all actually
does fit really well before I keep on
going with the build I was going to
install the power supply next but I
think I'm going to install the
motherboard next just because I really
want to get that water block mounted and
see how I'm gonna have to deal with that
thing that I cut out this is ps2
okay that's cool even though it's like a
really high end
any sous bored still got ps2 on it I
actually love that now please tell me
this reaches oh no oh no oh that's
pretty taut isn't it this would be the
worst if that doesn't fit I will be so
upset because then I would have cut that
hole for no reason I knew it was close
but I thought made it that socket is so
whoa oh no I don't think it makes it
have a plan not necessarily completely
ideal but the logo will now be vertical
I thought I had to do it the other way
the logo on g-scale Strix and the logo
on supreme effects are all also vertical
so this is just a vertical logo built it
was just totally the plan from the
beginning right guys that's looking all
right what do you think next up we have
to install the ax 1500 i and all of our
custom cable mod caves or always is on
that are really close it's also going to
be like a gap there what that doesn't
look very good but I actually can't even
install it the other way around
we're also this big extra large socket
interferes with things on the case so
this is just how it has to go I screwed
up so this is the rampage 5 edition 10
it's a motherboard that can support for
graphics cards this is the x99 Strix
Edition the one that's supposed to go in
my personal rig update that we're
filming later not the one that's
supposed to go in compensator I thought
it was like a funny coincidence after
all of that I should like all the RAM
off I have to take that CPU cooler off
after that crazy installation but to
take the CPU out
throw it all on here throw it back in
and then we're good yeah it's kind of a
fun I oh she'll the good-looking part of
the IO shield is actually on the board
already
so it just kind of slots there and this
board is slightly extended that means
that I have to install the power supply
first about these green and black cables
from cable mod they I believe completely
match the original cables that we had
for the very first compensator this will
be the bottom graphics card so one nice
thing about custom cables like this is I
can really easily splice off the extra
wires so I only need the 6 and the 6
plus 2 I don't have to use the extra
plus 2 that runs all the long with it
now I'm going to try to have some
foresight here and install this cable to
I'm also gonna try to pre run all the
SATA cables check all this stuff away
okay so motherboard install attempt
number three two three somewhere around
there I don't know losing track oh
please tell me this is gonna work we're
fine right yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
we're good we're good it's tight it's
very tight but it's fine nobody's
freaking out
the problem was getting the actual like
header block through that was an issue
whoa
from here we got to install some
graphics cards and a couple other things
and we're good to go
I can't install that here I'm going to
unplug the fans all right
now you go in there I really hate these
openings I think they look terrible one
nice thing well the graphics card right
coming right in here
they'll cover up this cable mess down at
the bottom okay so let's put in our
first Titan it looks so weird just one
car hit the bottom compensator what's up
this looks great right so you go to add
another one you know all right okay I'm
going to plug this in I'm gonna plug in
the little extension cable and then
everything looks terrible I hate it I
hate it so much
don't order the stupid ones that have
the loop-d-loop on them if you don't
have to just run another one look look
at how nice so much better no say no to
loopy dude cables so I'm just going to
install the glass panels just before I
do the SSDs and the fans if it really
needs lighting I want to figure out
where those go before I start finalizing
the cable management and add a ton of
cables by doing the SSDs before I do
this we should see if the computer turns
on at all okay let's get our ginormous
cable did you see whoa what I didn't
know it did that and like I knew okay I
knew the board lit up I didn't know like
before it was even turned on that it did
some cool stuff that's pretty sweet
okay so especially with the tinted
tempered glass on it looks pretty dark
so I'm probably going to try to add some
ambient lighting if I can
hahahaha title there okay can ignore my
arm how does that look can you see these
does it look cool so I'm just removing
some of the Leon Leaf fans putting in
some of my Noctua fans does it matter
not really so Leonie has a two and a
half inch spot down here and up here and
then six three and a half inch spots in
the middle of the cage that do not
naturally convert to two and a half if
you have trays for your SSDs you could
convert them but someone's like thrown
ours away or something so I don't
actually have proper places for the SSDs
to go so I'm just going to end up like
dumping them in here this can power my
nzv drive I'm going to try to make it
stay right about here if I can but for
the SSDs I think I'm just going to end
up going with like a stack and too many
power cables is another one okay all the
SSDs have been fed power but I need to
get the data installed so there's our
SSD spread all plugged in data and power
it doesn't look that great does it maybe
these go down here I don't know if I can
pull that off but I can try the tower of
data
okay that's pretty alright cool spin
okay so the power is in the lights are
all configured I only have one more
panel to put on what okay
hold up hold up hold up I can solve this
did someone unplug me no oh okay this
power supply the power symbol is off and
the one is on I it's not huh
alright it is the next day and it is
benchmarking time everything's up and
running the system is wicked fast due to
the raid array and the nvme drives and
whatnot we got a bunch of benchmarks
installed and we're going to redo some
from last time and do some new ones
okay so we got 17 408 yes better than
99% of all results framerate not great
did it did it do one hundred thirty
point three those cards get so loud how
hot are they getting eighty-eight
degrees on GPU one so this is my attempt
to load far cry 4 which just isn't
working at all control delete fail Altaf
or fail to tab nothing we're gonna try
loading this game computer just doesn't
like four cards go horsey go horsey go
this is running so bad doom is not that
hard to run
okay so benchmarking complete at idle
all of our cards ran up around 50
degrees give or take a few depending on
which one it was in the order so just
like with compensator one we could have
obviously benefitted from water cooling
the GPU stacking four isn't really a
great idea without water cooling because
they can't breathe and ran at about
eighty eight degrees all the time when
under load resulting in some pretty
serious throttling just like last time
we crushed in 3dmark fire strike and
again got in the top 1% of systems which
luckily is not based off of price per
performance although we did have some
pretty serious troubles with it but was
able to fight through it
or some configuration stuff last time
with the four original tight next cards
all the games worked but they just
chopped and glitched around and had some
tearing and all that kind of stuff this
time wasn't like that at all
performance was pretty terrible really
considering the cost and a couple games
just refused to work at all what I
expected to happen was that the system
would just completely ignore the third
and fourth cards and we just get some
thermal throttled two-way SLI
performance metrics that I could laugh
at but in reality the usage of the
second card often sat at around 20%
resulting in less than desirable results
the moral of the story with compensator
has always been the same you don't need
a rig this insane and when you do set up
something like this there are often more
drawbacks than you'd expect
yeah sure they'll perform pretty well in
3dmark and if you water cool and
overclock them you'll do pretty well on
the leaderboards but that's about it I
hope you had fun watching this build
personally just like last time I think
it's beautiful I love how it looks but
it's just a little misguided I chose the
four Titans knowing it would be a
problem but I did so because you can
still force four-way to work in some
games and it is still benchmark able
with synthetics we'll see what next year
has to offer I'll see you there with
compensator 3 so as you may have noticed
we were using cable mod cables for this
build just like we did with compensator
1 and now you can use their customizer
to get your own cable mod cables that
are specifically for you you just choose
your sleeve type your power supply brand
and model you select your size and
length then the color that you want and
bam you're done that's it that's all
the only remaining steps are waiting for
them to show up and installing them in
your system nice and easy you guys liked
this video like it if you just like this
video dislike it get subscribed all that
fun stuff check the link in the
description down below to see our
sponsors and to buy stuff on Amazon so
you can build your your own compensator
if you wanted to do that for some reason
also there's links to our shirts and
stuff and the forum where you can
discuss how my build was so terribly
misguided when that was the point of the
video anyways check out this video which
was compensator one and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
