temperatures and noise of the radion
6870 so I've got my handy dandy little
thermometer here showing us the room
temps because remember if the room
temperatures go up by even one degree
then the card temperatures will go up by
exactly one degree those are the rules
they must be obeyed so whenever you're
comparing temperatures you have to
remember you have to know the ambient
temperature so here you can see we have
a 41 degree idle at a 22 and a half 22
to 23 degree room temperature we're
going to treat this as sort of plus
minus one I mean look how sensitive this
thing is if I put my hand next to the
probe over here watch the temperature
skyrocket just from the heat my hands
giving off I'm not even touching the
thing pretty crazy so you got to sort of
see look at that it's already up to like
25 degrees just because of the heat from
my hand anyway so here it is at idle
it's basically silent at idle it's got a
little bit of a little bit of fan normal
fan sort of a grinding noise within
probably about 12 to 14 inches but
beyond that and especially inside a
closed case you will not hear this thing
so a 41 degree idle silent now let's see
what it looks like under a gaming load
now we've got what would represent a
worst case scenario gaming load so you
can see the room temperatures here and
you can see that running fur mark in
extreme burn mode is going to yield an
83 degree temperature you can also see
that the whoops fan speed has ramped up
a fair bit Wow not really much at all
that's incredible oh wait no it has it's
just not detected by afterburner okay so
you can listen
you can compare those two clips against
each other so it is quite a bit louder
but still quite tolerable especially for
like a performance like a mid-range
performance graphics card so I'm going
to give you just some comparisons
against the GTX 480 there's full speed
in case you were wondering but I'm going
to give you some comparisons against the
GTX 480 as well as the 5870 just so you
got a reference point here's the 58 70
for my noise comparison get it nice and
close to the fat now the 58 70 is
attached louder than the 68 70 at least
for my particular samples um one thing
that I mean those fans look so similar
but it almost looks like the new fan is
a little bit bigger you know what I'm
going to compare that justice I know the
fan is exactly the same diameter for
some reason there's a little bit more
word to this one it could just be that
it's older it is a bit of an older card
so you can see that my idle temps on
this particular card are 38 degrees
place you'd be able to see that if my
camera could focus on a monitor for a
change maybe that'll help there you go
39 degrees 38 degrees and then my room
temps are around 20 to 23 degrees so
there you go now we'll ramp it up now
bearing in mind that this is a more
powerful card
the noise level is quite a bit louder
and it does get hotter so it runs at
about 90 degrees using the default fan
profile remember with afterburner you
can always change profiles around if you
want so you can see we're running at
about 44 percent on the fan speed and 87
degrees on the GPU I think I already set
that yeah I already said that so I'm
just going to show you just for context
so remember fur mark is pretty much a
worst case scenario for a game running
like absolute worst case scenario it
won't get this hot it won't get this
loud in any sort of real game and this
is only if you set it manually but I'm
going to go ahead and turn it up to 100%
to see it
there you go okay moving on
and finally for comparison we had the
GTX 480 which is in some ways the top
dog in terms of noise generation due to
the power and size of the GPU inside it
so you can see our idle temperatures are
a little bit higher than the other two
cards that we were looking at at about
50 degrees my room temps just for your
reference are around the same they're 23
and a half degrees okay and then in
terms of fan noise you can see that fans
barely spinning I mean look at this it's
not going very fast at all this is quite
a quiet card at idle but it's a bit of a
different story under load so our GTX
480 peaked at around just over 90
degrees under load can see here infer
Marc I want to stress again but not only
for the GTX 480 but for the other cards
that we're looking at here that fir mark
represents an unrealistic gaming load
it's mostly a tool for finding out the
absolute max temps and making sure that
your card is 100% stable with an
overclock so there's your reference
point for listening to it and just for
fun I'm going to turn this one up to a
hundred percent if you really want to
blow your ears off
quite quite loud at that particular
setting so go ahead and put it back to
auto I mean bear in mind the GTX 480
does ramp up to about 80 percent fan
speed under under an intense load like
this anyhow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
