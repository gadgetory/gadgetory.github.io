an unboxing of an EVGA video card that
is unique so first I'm gonna tell you
all of the things that are not unique
what's not unique is that this is a
geforce card EVGA is a geforce exclusive
vendor what's not unique is that this is
a 1.2 8 gigabyte gddr5 card just like
every other gtx 570 under the sun it is
also not unique that it is a gtx 570 it
is not unique that it supports 3d vision
surround in sli mode which is also not
unique DirectX 11 and physics are not
unique features and neither is the fact
that it supports HD resolutions but
these two letters right here indicate
what is unique about this card I'm not
gonna spoil the surprise now even though
I I just foreshadowed it if you guys
were paying very very close attention
you would have noticed what exactly I
just did for Shadow and is unique about
it so first of all let's take off the
packaging because that is what I do on
this channel I open up all the sexy
computer products so that you guys can
see them ok so let's talk about what's
special about EVGA what special about
EVGA is a couple things warranty EVGA
has one of the most reputable warranties
and the graphics card biz everyone knows
this now bear in mind that the
warranties do vary based on the part
number so I don't believe this one has a
lifetime warranty but some products do
okay this is a K R suffix product you
can see that right there so yeah I'm not
sure what the warranty is on this card
but you can always look it up find out
what kr means by going on their site
EVGA has 24/7 support a bunch of stuff
over here most of this is not
particularly unique and they've got
their precision tool which is awesome
based on if you leave it's based on
rivet tuner ok and I believe it also
actually works on non EVGA cards as well
don't forget they have their trade-in
program so if something new comes out
and you
you don't like it anymore and you're
still within a I forget how many days it
is Wow I'm terrible right now sorry guys
but anyway they have a trade-in program
as well which is awesome and pretty
unique but that's not the thing that's
so special about this card okay here we
have a driver disc and a case batch so
don't use that download the latest from
the Nvidia website okay we have a Quick
Start Guide for a GTX 580 and 570 you
probably shows us how to plug in power
connectors and how to install a PCIe
graphics card very nice here we have a
poster okay okay it has a spell on it
EVGA giving makes you die
visit the website doesn't make you die
it makes other people die I think that's
what they mean all right
foam please allow the graphics card to
cool for a minimum of two minutes after
operation before removing it from your
system okay EVGA here we've got a dual
molex to a single PCIe 6 pin adapter
here we have another one show you that
again here we have a DVI to VGA adapter
and here we have the part itself I'm
gonna go ahead and pull that sticker off
you guys what is unique about this
graphics card so the first thing I'll
actually notice about it is that this
does not appear to be a reference card
this looks a lot closer to a gtx 560 in
terms of the cooler design of a few heat
pipes down there it's got a flower style
cooler like the intel stock heatsink you
can see that there when I spin the fan
okay
now appears that we are not using an
entirely external exhaust system here so
you can see the VRMs are cooled by black
heat sinks and they're gonna get some
incidental airflow from that their fan
alright we've got two PCIe 6 pin
connectors so this is clearly not a
reference PCB because normally on the
gtx 570 reference cards the pc
e power connectors are up here we do
have full support for 3-way SLI because
we do have two sli bridges up here but
even the custom cooler and custom PCB
are not what is unique about this card
what is so unique is this I'm gonna give
it away now DisplayPort so this card
supports DVI HDMI and DisplayPort
outputs isn't that cool
so here on the back you can see where
the GPU is you can see where all the RAM
chips are installed and you can see that
it uses a PCIe 16x connector to install
into your motherboard and that took a
fair amount of googling around to find
the answer but the inevitable question
if we've added DisplayPort how many
displays can we output at one time the
answer is still - so you can either use
dual DVI DVI HDMI DVI DisplayPort hdmi
displayport but not all four and not
even three of them at the same time so
there you go and I think that is pretty
much everything I wanted to say about
the GTX 570 HD thank you for watching
