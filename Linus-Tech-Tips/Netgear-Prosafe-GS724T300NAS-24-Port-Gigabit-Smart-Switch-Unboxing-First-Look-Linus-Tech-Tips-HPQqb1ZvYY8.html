value net cure switch this is from their
pro series it is the m GS 72 40 - 300 na
s and it is a 24 port gigabit smart
switch with web-based management and so
yeah if you're looking for basically if
you need a smart switch okay with
web-based management and you need a
bunch of gigabit ports because most
inexpensive switches are still using ten
hundred ports for the bulk of them this
is pretty much the one to get it's
around the $200 mark and we're going to
be using this for a really cool little
project where we show you how with okay
it's not cheap but for about a thousand
bucks plus drives you can turn your home
storage server into a four gigabit home
storage server that is capable of
streaming one gigabit per second so a
gigabit network connection to multiple
computers within your house all
concurrently which means at the same
time so on the front we find a Netgear
logo we find some indicators for the
various 24 ports including their speed
their link activity so Green is for
gigabit yellow is for 100 megabit you
can see we've got 24 port okay the sec
so these two right here are fiber
modules I was checking to see if they
were ten gigabit capable but it makes
sense that their module bays sorry sorry
sorry they're not modules they're empty
they have placeholders in them so yeah
it would make sense that on a $200
switch they're not so you can put one
gig fiber modules in here which will
allow you to run over greater distances
if you have the desire to do that pretty
much okay
factory default reset okay and here you
can see a beefy looking heatsink going
on and we've got a power port and some
more ventilations more beefy looking
these things you can tell the power
supply is here it comes with a pretty
cool little chart that tells you all
about NIC years various switches
and the features they have which is what
we handle II looked at this one for so
you can see this is a smart managed
switch whereas when you get into the
more expensive stuff you get into the
Poli notes which is which has more
features and could do all kinds of like
more awesome and interesting stuff so
the gs-7 2040 is the one that we're
looking at here which is it's got like
assault but all kinds of great stuff
like max bandwidth it's capable of mean
time between failure which is around
500,000 hours 21.5 watts of power
consumption and the lifetime warranty on
the hardware and the power supply
it doesn't include much although it does
include a useful little disk that has an
application that allows you to easily
plug your switch into your network and
then not have to try and figure out what
address to type in to access it it'll
just find it on the network and then
it'll tell you what the IP is so
resource CD and as well as your
documentation for the switch itself I
think that's pretty much it we're just
unboxing this so that we can get on with
that project so it's like saying
something to me I don't know what he's
saying to me I don't know he was telling
me to say lifetime warranty
um which I'm pretty sure I already said
so don't forget to subscribe - tech tips
from one boxing's reviews and other
computer videos well Slick's gonna fail
in the video I guess I I deserve to have
one fail as well this comes with a power
cable as well as ears for mounting it
into a into a rack and screws for
mounting it into a rack</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
