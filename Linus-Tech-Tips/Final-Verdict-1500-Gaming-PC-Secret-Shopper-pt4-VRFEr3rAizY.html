endured tech support hell and now
finally after three weeks of waiting
we're ready to share the performance of
our $1,500 gaming systems in both gaming
and Game Capture workloads but not
before we share with you some
interesting discoveries that cropped up
while we were taking a closer look at
these machines because uh oh boy there's
far more here than meets the eye
Thermaltake say 500 has a modern
minimalistic design with brushed
aluminum panels and duel him swinging
tempered glass doors check it out today
at the link below
okay I know I am just as psyched to find
out which of our rigs produces the most
FPS as you guys but we've actually got
some other really really important stuff
to go through here first let's start
with Alienware so this thing shipped
with a reasonably recent version of
Windows 10 build 1803 and needed very
few updates in order to get up and
running the theme wallpaper and boot
logo were all set so you'd know that
dude you're getting a Dell I mean
Alienware and bloatware didn't look too
bad so let's see here we've got updater
mobile connector customer connect alien
effects whatever for lighting and
overclocking control but let's come back
to bloatware later first something got
weird this system uses over 4 gigabytes
of RAM at idle that is double our other
machines and after we manually killed
any and all Alienware / Dell processes
it barely budged then we subjected the
machine to a CPU stress test and this is
even weirder normally this kind of
stress test loads up all of the course
to the hilt but on this machine the load
fluctuated not only that but the CPU
would boost to 4.5 ish gigahertz hit
temperatures in the high 90 degrees
Celsius then do this weird thing where
the cooling would rather super hard then
the temps and the clock speeds would go
down rinse and repeat what because like
if the processor can't handle the
standard load why on earth do they have
overclocking support well to see how bad
that would be we fired it up and wait
are you sure you got this right
this is bizarre this shows that the CPU
while overclocked neither overheated nor
dropped below 4.3 gigahertz that is the
max six core load per Intel spec that
means that enabling OC stage 1 was
faster and cooler than the
out-of-the-box settings and not to
mention essentially required to get the
processor running the way that it was
supposed to to begin with stage 2 was
not as rosy with our processors shooting
up to 4.8 your hertz occasionally but
then quickly toning itself back down to
3.7 okay what made this even more
puzzling was that after we disabled the
software Oh see that weird turbo up in
overheating behavior completely
disappeared and that's not even the end
of our software and firmware and
whatever issues with this box but we
really need to move on to hardware now
so our graphics card is a standard-issue
GTX 1060 that behaved entirely
predictably - the driver set from six
months ago
so that's alright but there are some
issues here that we missed during the
initial inspection first we found that
the machine had a sloppily wired Wi-Fi
module then we noticed that while the
Box said nvme our configuration is
actually equipped with an N dot to drive
that uses SATA rather than PCI Express
meaning that there is no performance
benefit over a traditional two and a
half inch drive now our invoice was
marked correctly it's not false
advertising or anything like that it's
just kind of a drag anyway much more
interesting is the topmost PCI Express
slot that runs at only 8x electrically
rather than 16x no matter what we did
and that our multi-gpu approved power
supply only has 385 Watts combined on
its 12-volt rails with no eighty plus
certification whatsoever
now given that this
Sheen already pulls around 300 watts
from the wall under a combined CPU and
GPU load calling that sli capable is
misleading at best one positive note is
that the power supply fan does stop
under low load and our machine idles at
just 26 watts furthermore after the rev
up throttle down behavior magically
disappeared the system would only hum up
under load with no sharp fan Rev ups
those naked vrm modules that we were
concerned about before by the way those
did not end up heating up pretty much at
all and finally when it comes to the
UEFI BIOS settings they were about as
sparse as you'd expect with a pre-built
machine like this with no option to save
a profile and SATA mode set to raid
which then disables BIOS recovery from a
hard drive which is enabled by default
so I guess all we can really say is
let's move on to the HP omen
unlike the Alienware our HP omen shipped
with Windows 10 version 1709 from over a
year ago so between that and replacing
the graphics driver from five months ago
it took over an hour to get this thing
updated out of the box
I've note is that the issue with games
running slower off of the hard drive
versus the SSD that we encountered while
using this machine in our Walmart PC
video has gone away so that's good and
we were also pleased to see less than
two gigs of our RAM being used at idle
that is half of the Alienware onto
software the so-called omen command
center commands almost nothing except
for enabling dual force mode to send low
priority networking traffic over the
integrated Wi-Fi and then higher
priority packets over Ethernet but I
mean given that they both terminate at
the same modem I'm I'm having a hard
time understanding what the point of
that is also of note our omen included
McAfee Antivirus so if you want to
uninstall it John says hi
now here's something weird
our 8700 nan ka processor boosted to
about 3.5 gigahertz with all core turbo
now this is well below the 4.3 gigahertz
all core boost that gamers Nexus
measured for this CPU and only 10% above
base clock now why HP might have
handicapped the CPU frequency in this
way is not clear but what we do know is
that this can only hurt it when it comes
to performance moving on our graphics
card is a bone-stock gtx 1070 with as
expected behavior and then finishing it
up in here
we found a Wi-Fi module that we actually
didn't notice during our unboxing also
it turns out that our power supply is
rated to 470 watts max on the 12-volt
rails with 80-plus certification so far
more sli ready actually than the one in
the dell moving on to the bios well
actually you just don't get to pressing
f2 at boot takes you to a diagnostic
screen for just about every subsystem in
The Omen from CPU and RAM to USB and
keyboard then going to advanced reboot
yields a mostly useless grey on blue
setup screen straight out of the 90s all
right let's move on to the iBUYPOWER rig
now then which is apparently so advanced
that Janus is not even worthy of opening
it and you're not able to help me
through that not my ability to manage
your ability to look inside a computer
nothing better with the part it's gonna
be very difficult to do anything inside
while this one shipped with a recent
version of Windows 10 the machine still
did require quite a few updates and the
graphics driver here is the oldest one
yet I mean I guess that's what they had
rolled into their OS image and they just
haven't bothered to update it I mean
frankly back in NCIX
we did a lot of stuff wrong we did but
we did regularly update the bloody
graphics drivers for our gaming systems
like I
with that said this behavior doesn't
seem that surprising given the clap it
together and ship it overall build
quality that we observed there were zero
changes made to the UEFI BIOS so that
means no optimised profile was saved
even though the option is present on
this motherboard and in practical terms
this means that while our invoice
boasted a free upgrade to three thousand
megahertz rams concede in there it's all
shiny ours was only running at the
default twenty six 66 megahertz don't
get me wrong everything worked and it
was stable with our CPU boosting to 4.3
gigahertz max across all cores as
expected and our graphics card was
factory overclocked with idle RAM usage
that was normal it's just that we didn't
really get a you know we care a lot vibe
from the overall build quality like
again this kind of sort of sloppiness
doesn't affect performance which we will
see is definitely a strong point for
this system but not even one of the CPU
cooling fans is plugged into the CPU fan
header they put the pump there when
there's an empty pump header right here
I mean why and like we found a grand
total of exactly one zip tie and one
twist tie in the entire system let's
move on to the next Oh
so this is what you get for fifteen
hundred US dollars from Origin PC a core
i5 processor and a gtx 1050 Ti I mean at
this point it almost doesn't really
matter what else they do right does it
but for the sake of completeness let's
take a look the OS the machine shipped
with was recent and so was the graphics
driver that shouldn't be worth bonus
points but apparently it is
idle RAM usage was sub 2 gigabytes
another good thing but we did notice
that when we looked at the UEFI settings
but while our XMP 3000 megahertz profile
was enabled for our RAM the speed field
was left on auto which for some reason
caused it to clock in slightly lower at
29 33 2 origins credit even though only
that one setting was tweaked on the
machine it was saved into a profile
which we could load onto it for our
performance testing but profiles are
only as useful as how enabled they are
we've really hoped that our tech would
prompt us when we call them for tech
support to load the profile after that
hole only half the ran is being detected
incident but he didn't looking under the
hood we found cable management that on
the surface looked pretty good until we
noticed that our pump was powered via
molex which means no speed control and
no warning if your pump dies and then
making matters worse we noticed that
there is an available header on the
motherboard that they used that they
plugged the front intake fan into
instead then this is the worst thing yet
we came to the pass-through power cable
that connects the rear plug on the back
of the actual system to the power supply
inside because it's got a really unusual
internal layout this here uses non
soldered hobby-grade connectors and on
our machine the metal contacts were
slightly exposed with no power off
switch available at the back of the
system that means that while it would be
unlikely these can slip off and someone
could accidentally bridge those live
wires full AC power with their fingers
this could and should be done better
let's move on to main gear first we need
to make a correction here during the
purchasing part of this system the rep
mentioned the two-year extended warranty
and we laughed oh oh here comes the
warranty pitch well you see wait for the
last you know
oh man he mentioned it because it was
free and that's a good thing but we were
mostly laughing because we'd sat through
so many warranty pitches in the last two
hours
we should have corrected ourselves
because free is free baby so thanks to
our commenters for noticing that as for
the machine itself well the software
side was virgin other than a custom boot
logo wallpaper and a red theme both the
OS and the graphics driver were recent
and our GTX 1060 was a factory
overclocked version the processor
clocked itself at about 3.9 gigahertz on
all six cores this is exactly what we
would expect for a risin 2600 ex and we
noticed that the machine had its high
performance power plan enabled by
default this would help explain why it
had the highest idle power draw out of
our competitors at around 50 watts but
that is considered best practice with
Rison processors the UEFI did have a
factory settings profile set but there
was really nothing in there that would
affect performance just a couple of
networking related settings and boot
mode forced into UEFI only mode a closer
look at the insides revealed that well
in terms of issues we had a really hard
time finding fault in this build
they even cable managed the backside of
the motherboard tray digging deeper the
power button was slightly off-center I
guess but that's more of like a case QC
issue and actually no this was one the
hard drive SATA cable clicked when we
pushed on it meaning that it wasn't
actually in a hundred percent but the
drive was detected and did work out of
the box and given main gears support if
that did come out and shipping I'm sure
they would have been able to help us
with it pretty quickly so then line them
all up here I guess let's finally do it
for you let's summarize the specs of all
the machines we ended up with Alienware
shipped with a liquid-cooled 8700 k
processor 16 gigs of
666 RAM a stock GTX 1060 with a 128 gig
SATA OS drive coupled with the 2
terabytes of storage and it was powered
by a multi-gpu approved 460 watt power
supply HP shipped our Ohlman with a non
k 8700 processor with 16 gigs of 24
hundred megahertz ram a vanilla gtx 1070
a 256 gig nvme drive they were the only
one to ship an nvme boot drive weren't
they and 2 terabytes of mechanical
storage they also threw in a decent 80 +
500 watt power supply and they had a 200
dollar Canadian 150 dollar US promotion
at the checkout it should be noted we
bought all of these systems though
during intel's gamer days promotion so
every SI had the same opportunity to
take advantage of that ibuypower jumped
the gun smartly selling us a pre-order
of the core i5 9600 K before it was
formerly shipping they cooled it with an
AI o water cooler threw it in an MSI z3
98 a motherboard loaded up 16 gigs of 26
66 megahertz ram and through a 240 gig
SATA OS drive with one terabytes of
storage in it we've got a factory
overclocked gtx 1070 the most powerful
graphics card out of the bunch and that
was powered by a quality 750 watt power
supply that we got upgraded to for free
on paper this one should be the fastest
system for gaming origin uh origin we've
got a liquid-cooled Core i5 8400 with a
gtx 1050 TI and a hundred and 20 gigs of
SATA SSD storage with no extra
mechanical storage for our game library
the power supply is a high quality 450
watt unit but the fancy Z 390
overclocking capable motherboard even
though it's it's quality doesn't make
sense for this config our CPU doesn't
support overclocking honestly this
config is a total dog's breakfast
finally main gear sold us the only AMD
system in the lineup with a 200
40-millimeter AIO cool dries in 5:20
600x
this could end up very interesting
because we did specifically mention to
everyone on the phone that we wanted to
not only game but also record our
gameplay for YouTube they went with an
MS I'd be 350 M pro vidi motherboard
with 16 gigs of 26 66 megahertz ram a
256 gigs SATA OS SSD a one terabyte
storage drive and a factory overclocked
GTX 1060 all this was powered by an EVGA
500 watt power supply and of note is
that the 200 US dollar discount that was
applied to our check out due to intel's
gamers days promotion was something we
were able to take advantage of however
that works for an AMD based
configuration okay so which one of these
is the fastest for gaming well in a
massive surprise to no one I buy power
and HP omen
dominated our suite of gaming benchmarks
with I buy power edging out its closest
competitor pretty handily thanks to its
factory overclocked graphics card and
the fact that its CPU was turbo Eng
correctly I mean you want your CPU turbo
incorrectly that seems like a good idea
right
who knew main gears machine and our
Alienware Aurora then traded blows
thanks to their similar grade of
graphics firepower in the next year down
and as for our origin Chronos well it
didn't manage to break 60 FPS in any of
our gaming tests aside from csgo also
for the sake of completeness we actually
tested the origin machine with both the
core i3 that fit within our budget and
the i-5 that they upsold us to make
there's not only the worst performer in
the bunch but also the most expensive
system that we purchased now on to
recording videos to post to YouTube now
this is presumably what led main gear to
recommend a 6 core 12 thread AMD
system now we never mentioned streaming
so we were actually kind of hoping for
someone to recommend using shadowplay
because it mostly just works and comes
with very little performance penalty if
you want to just you know cut together
your frag vids but no I think everyone
kind of assumed we were streaming anyway
on to testing we said OBS to the same
1080p 60fps 3500 megabit per second CBR
settings on all machines and then we
just kept cranking the x264 encoder
until we started dropping frames which
actually brings us back to alien where
did what so check this out regardless of
encoder quality our aurora dropped a
savage number of frames and spit out
rendering errors so the benchmark that
we chose would run at 60fps like so our
game was fine our CPU usage remained
reasonable and yet the end recording was
unwatchable every single time and this
behavior persisted even when we switched
to the N Bank Nvidia encoder which has
nothing to do with the CPU so Ivan's
like racking his brain for a week on
this stupid thing trying different
settings recording to a different drive
resetting and reinstalling the software
using a different graphics card out of
our inventory and even going as far as
asking one of the key OBS dance what the
heck is going on here
finally we relented and popped one of
our bench boot SSDs into the Aurora only
for it to immediately stop having the
issues but then the mystery goes deeper
still because we tried our alien where
OS drive in another similar spec
testbench machine and continued
experiencing the same issue so while we
do not know what precisely is going on
we've done our diligence and we've
managed to deduce that something we're
pretty sure is just broken and software
on our alien worm machine
maybe it has to do with the high idle
RAM usage onto the rest then our main
gear machine hung in there until the
medium quality setting that's our best
result with our HP omen coming in 2nd
iBUYPOWER came in third as expected
starting to lose frames at the faster
preset when it came to CPU encoding and
then as for the Chronos well see that's
it right
what were we really expecting on a
system that couldn't hit 60fps in the
first place so what's the takeaway from
all this when it comes to raw gaming
power for the price I buy power took the
prize that is if you're comfortable with
their quality tech support but that also
doesn't necessarily mean that HP lost
thanks in part to their promo price they
put up a surprisingly good fight when it
came to gaming performance and there
were aspects of this system that don't
directly impact gaming but are certainly
benefits like the nvme boot SSD versus a
cheapo SATA one in the iBUYPOWER rig not
to mention the carrying handle the
excellent i/o and the handy easy
harddrive upgrade slots now their tech
support was far from perfect but they
weren't dismissive or rude to us and
they did eventually solve the problem
after those two we would have a tie for
second
if Alienware could get their preloaded
OS figured out and also if their pre
sales and after sales support weren't
both abominable across the board now I'm
sure Alienware would say that we got
unlucky but here's my response to that
between all the call transfers that we
went through I'm pretty sure we talked
to probably half a dozen people who
worked there and every single one of
them was worse than both of the people
that we talked to at main gear so
there's just no contest here main gear
comes in third speaking of no contest
origin PC they did do some things well
their staff were polite
competent and helpful but at the end of
the day this was a pretty simple
transaction we you $1,500 give you us
gaming PC send and while they did a good
job of taking our $1,500 I would argue
that they didn't really hold up their
end of the bargain this a gaming PC well
it's a gaming PC but certainly not for
$1,500
so I guess that I guess that's it right
are we done for this season for this
season oh lordy are we doing this again
boy this was time-consuming but we
really hope that you guys have enjoyed
it I know Ivan's been tearing his hair
out but I mean was it fun at least yes
you know you know you know it was
actually it was a lot of fun to go
through this maybe we'll do something
like this that's similar in the future
leave us a comment in the video
description with with what you guys
would like to see us secret shop you
know Lynam tech investigator and stoy
ski and all that good stuff so now it's
time for our sponsor master on the mast
Rob Sennheiser HD 6 xx headphones sound
fantastic and why shouldn't they they're
based on Sennheiser's legendary HT 6 50s
with pretty much nothing tuned that is
why they have sold over 50,000 units of
this stuff just nice natural bass and a
really full sound to these open backed
cans we've got a detachable six-foot
cable now instead of the 10-foot one
that's based on community feedback
because people don't want to get tangled
up in it and they include a 1/8 inch
plug that's versatile for everyday use a
quarter inch adapter so you can plug it
into anything you'd want and
Sennheiser's long-term support check out
