DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts this video is
actually going to cover a lot of new
ground for me first up is that this is
the first a MVA panel that I've had the
pleasure of using second is that this is
the first 32 inch 2560 by 1440 monitor
that I've used and finally this is the
first time I've ever seen a truly
premium monitor aimed at professionals
from BenQ something I wasn't really
expecting given their recent focus on
gamers so let's kick things off with a
physical tour of the BL 3200 PT holy
actual balls this my friends is a 32
inch monitor with height adjust tilt
swivel and yes pivot a 32 inch monitor
with pivot as much as most people won't
care about this feature for folks who
use multiple ninety-degree monitors in
surround or I don't know consume a lot
of content on reddit or for whatever
reason like pivot this will be an
absolute godsend of course if the stands
construction wasn't up to snuff
this feature wouldn't count for Jack but
this is the best built monitor I have
ever seen from Ben q and considering
it's only $800 I know only $800 it just
is
straight-up really impressive the screen
uses a just right light anti-glare
coating and the front bezel is a
reasonably thin plastic adorned only by
a small thank you logo a Kiwi key badge
that sits next to the ambient light
sensor and human motion sensor and a row
of capacitive touch buttons that
illuminate when you put your hand near
them
the base and back used that brushed
plastic I'm so fond of that looks like
brushed aluminum but doesn't stain like
brushed aluminum and the stand itself oh
man that solid piece of curved aluminum
adds both strength and beauty to the
design in a way that I just wasn't
expecting it would feel like a crime to
take it off but in case you wanted to
there's also a standard base amount
hiding back there so you can put it on
whatever arm you wanted inputs are
mounted on the right a configuration
that's becoming more
on TVs and one that I really liked
compared to digging around under a
display and to go along with the
included dual link DVI DisplayPort and
VGA cables we've got dual link DVI
DisplayPort 1.2 and VGA inputs HDMI is
also present but it ends up being a bit
of a redheaded stepchild since BenQ
doesn't include an HDMI cable with the
monitor and I can see why since I really
wouldn't recommend using it for anything
other than maybe like a secondary input
for like a game console or something
since you'll be stuck at an interpolated
1920 by 1080 resolution due to HDMI
bandwidth limitations speaking of
limitations this seems like a good time
to mention that there is no support for
picture in picture or picture by picture
so you can just switch between the
inputs but that's about it I personally
never use these features but your
mileage may vary also on the right is an
SD card reader 2 USB 3 ports and an
almost cleverly positioned headphone
jack it's better than putting it on the
bottom but given that most headphones
have the connector on the left ear cup
this solution may need to be routed
across your peripherals to reach it oh
well baby steps towards perfection right
like to see it on the left next time
thank you finally on the bottom we've
got a USB 3 input 2 USB to ports and a
weird little micro B connector that
leads to a more stylish variation of the
controller that we've seen BenQ include
on some of their gaming monitors it
allows you to navigate the on-screen
display basically speaking of the
on-screen display it's fairly intuitive
and offers a ton of different options
you can toggle auto pivot set the usual
picture controls cycle through a wide
variety of display profiles including a
blue light reduction mode that's
supposed to improve comfort but I
personally found just looked a bit too
oranjee for me to get used to you can
set a periodic reminder to look away
from your monitor and rest your eyes you
can tell the monitor to save power when
you're not in front of it or even self
adjust its brightness for different
ambient light levels with the onboard
sensors and more it is a little bit slow
to navigate especially when using the
display mode controls to emulate
different display sizes but fortunately
most people will take a set and forget
approach here and for those who don't
there's always the ability to change the
quick access buttons on the control puck
for fast access to those frequently used
sub menus now it's time to talk panel
this monitor is
seriously unusual in a way that for some
people will be a huge selling point at
about 92 pixels per inch its pixel
density is only a tiny bit lower than
that sweet spot 24 inch 16 by 10 that
I'm always talking about but at 32
inches diagonally it offers a ton more
real estate both physically and in terms
of resolution
it's a mva panel with DC backlight
control makes it surprisingly
comfortable to use in spite of its
massive size it delivers clear crisp
high contrast text comfortable flicker
free performance in bright and dim
environments and on top of that very
strong viewing angles for a VA with only
a noticeable vertical contrast shift at
moderate to extreme angles to take marks
off for for gamers
I measured 27.5 milliseconds of display
leg with my brand new Leo Bodnar display
leg tester but TFT central brought my
attention to one simple tweak turning a
NA too high that can bring that down to
only 23 milliseconds or about a frame
and a half at 60 Hertz
that combined with reasonable smearing
or ghosting compared to other VA
monitors makes it an okay choice for
gaming especially if you want a very
large display but certainly nowhere near
fast 120 or 144 Hertz TN panels speaking
of it not being TN this monitors 10 bit
panel can handle the entire sRGB color
space which is plenty unless you're
working on some seriously specialized
content but most folks won't use VA
monitors for crazy high-end color work
anyway due to the slight reduction in
contrast when viewing straight on this
is really picky stuff though it looked
great in day to day use out of the box
and running it through a basic color
calibration routine with an ex right
color monkey only resulted in slightly
subdued oranges and boosted Gama
revealing some more details in the
shadows the before and after looked
pretty darn similar so it's great out of
the box all of that well deserved
positivity aside for some reason it just
didn't click for me my daily drivers are
2560 by 1440 27 inch a 34 40 by 1440 34
inch and a 1080p 12 inch and while I did
find that I could comfortably read text
and whether it was due to the flicker
free nhanh pwm backlight or something
else I wasn't sure of it wasn't
nearly as fatiguing to use as my old
30-inch I think I've just become
accustomed to sitting closer to a
smaller higher pixel density display and
it was too hard for me to go back which
isn't to say it's a bad monitor in fact
truthfully I can think of a lot of
people who would love it it's closer to
TV size for a dorm than a monitor size
so movie watching is very satisfying
even if the built-in speakers are
nothing special you can always hook up
other speakers to your PC so you turn it
this way to watch movie turn it this way
back to your chair you sit in it awesome
the high contrast with no IPS glow makes
reading a treat and the fact that it
offers truly class-leading build quality
and ergonomics will appeal to many
professionals I mean I don't know what
else to say the issue with my conclusion
here is that I'm saying it doesn't work
for me but I can't come up with a better
solution at all if you want a massive
monitor for productivity use since on
Windows anyway right now 4k monitors
aside from being very expensive still at
this kind of a size have some issues
with readability and UI scaling unless
you have eagle eyes so let's do this let
me know your thoughts in the comments am
I just totally off-base here and this is
the best thing since sliced bread or
would you spend your money on something
else either way I want to give kudos to
Ben Q for bringing a truly different
product to market even if it's not one
that floated my personal boat 2560 by
1440 but at the same pixel density as a
24 inch to 1920 by 1200 alright well I
think that's pretty much it guys thank
you for watching don't forget to like
dislike or share this video according to
how you felt about it also in the video
