allowing us to be here at CES 2016 you
can check out the link in the video
description to learn more so here we are
in the private listening room on the
show floor at the Sennheiser booth and
we are going to be seeing for the first
time the $50,000 follow-up to the
original Sennheiser orpheus headphones I
haven't seen it yet but apparently
they're here somewhere I actually don't
know where they are so let's go find out
because there's not a whole lot in here
okay so oh there's there's an activation
experience this is one of the coolest
things okay
that knob right there with the red light
if you just press it in very gently
uh-huh right there in front yep
just tap that in okay turns white yep
and then you'll see the front knobs oh
they all come out thing is motorized and
then the tubes will open up and then the
case will open up on its own and then
kind of raise the headphone slightly and
this is done for two reasons one it's
really fun to watch too it also only
takes 20 seconds for the tubes to warm
up to be ready for use so it's the whole
process is done with purpose so that now
you put your glass down hit the button
have a sip of your drink and then you're
ready to go okay so um so now what I
just take him out and off I go they come
out and run as fast as you can yeah okay
so let's talk about the transducer for a
minute the main difference between an
electrostatic headphone and a more
traditional magnetic driven headphone is
that well there's there's no magnets you
don't have magnets and a diaphragm and
then the differing magnetic fields move
it back and forth and cause the
vibration that creates the sound waves
that you hear instead we are actually
using we're actually manipulating these
tiny thin sheets of in this case a
vaporized platinum to move back and
forth to deliver the best possible sound
and when I say best possible sound I
really do mean they spend a lot of time
figuring out that 2.8 micrometers was
the optimal thickness for the vaporized
platinum transducer in order to achieve
what they're saying is eight Hertz all
the way up to one
hundred thousand Hertz of frequency
response so to put that in perspective I
could not hear how good they are neither
could you
I don't care how much of an audiophile
they are literally beyond human
comprehension it's true the rest of the
unit features fairly exotic materials
and construction techniques as well
everything from the aluminum fins on the
outsides of the ear cups in order to
keep the power sources cool to the
actual like hybrid velour sort of soft
material and genuine leather material
that sits up against your head for
maximum comfort now that's not to say
that all of the craziness is necessarily
in just the headphones and let's move
our attention to the entire completed
unit 6000 hand-built components make up
the entire Orpheus experience everything
from the single slab of it's some fancy
marble I'm sure we can put a note in the
video I've forgotten what it is but it's
apparently very very amazing there you
go Carrara marble for the base station
itself it takes an entire day to create
one of these units with someone
assembling it in Germany yes an entire
day to build one of them and they've
even they thought of everything because
the bottom of the amplifier unit itself
is actually a shock absorber so just in
case you're on a crowded show floor hall
floor and people are funding around
outside like elephants it will be able
to absorb some of that so it doesn't
transfer it to the listener but all of
that sin theory I haven't actually put
them on yet so why don't we do that next
I always wondered what a $50,000 pair of
headphones sounds like kind of shaky
so Hotel California is just the the
universal song that everyone's obviously
heard on their high-end headphones good
choice
30 years
well the appointments are unfortunately
only 15 minutes long but it's very clear
and this is not going to come as a
surprise to anyone that that is by far
the best rendition of Hotel California I
have ever heard
however would I pay $50,000 for it well
that's going to come down to the
individual buyer and this is the part of
my CES coverage of the Orpheus that
Sennheiser is probably not going to like
that much with the original Orpheus what
I liked about it was the exclusivity of
the item and while this one is expensive
enough that not all of your neighbors
are going to have one in their basement
next to their you know old lazy boy from
the 80s that's just the right kind of
comfortable they are not limiting
production this time outside of a yearly
maximum quota so would you if you have
the money pay fifty thousand dollars
even knowing that someone else could buy
one if they could scrape together the
dough or would you prefer son Heiser had
gone the same route as last time and
made it a numbered limited-edition let
me know in the comments and let me know
