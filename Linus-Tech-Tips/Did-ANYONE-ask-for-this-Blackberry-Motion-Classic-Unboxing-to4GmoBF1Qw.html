believe I'm here again this is my third
trip here this month doing an unboxing
that nobody asked for of a product that
as far as I'm aware nobody asked for
this is the BlackBerry motion the latest
in the lineup of BlackBerry smartphones
produced under license by TCL so on the
surface this appears to be pretty much I
like this table got like a look at that
it's like authoritative BAM so on the
surface this thing doesn't appear to be
really much of anything special it's got
a Snapdragon what would what is it a 625
processor it's got four gigs of RAM
let's fire this baby up
it's got 32 gigabytes or if you're more
of the French persuasion 32 gig of
octets so you got that going for you
Android 7.1 nougats a 5.5 inch full HD
display with a premium nano diamond
coated display you got a sim removal
tool and a booklet see look I'd save
myself the trouble of unboxing it
they've got a picture cool you got a
quick charger it's got a four thousand
milliamp hour battery which is a first
for blackberry and actually pretty
unusual in general you got a Type C
charging cable it does of course charge
with type C and it's a little replace
why does blackberry still need to exist
in the modern age as a Canadian I guess
there's like kind of a sentimental
attachment to the brand that probably
most people wouldn't share but as it is
like even with the sentimentality you
still have to find a way to
differentiate yourself so let's have a
look at this phone then so on the back
they've got kind of a textured kind of
rubberized grip ii thing going on with
of course that iconic blackberry logo
they've got an 8 megapixel rear shooter
that I have to confess this unboxing is
a lie I did leave this on it but as you
can plainly see if I flip this around
I have definitely already been using
this phone it definitely has a bunch my
apps on it so the camera could be best
described as pretty mediocre though it
does shoot 4k video if you care about
that sort of thing the shape of the
phone is going to be a little bit
polarizing so it's got kind of these
these harder corners up at the top and
this this asymmetric kind of rounded
thing down here at the bottom but
personally actually the thing it reminds
me of most so far is actually the razor
phone which I've been using as my daily
driver lately so they're very similar in
the sense that they're these kind of
blocky phones of course the razor phone
is more expensive and has a couple of
advantages it's got a 120 Hertz display
it's got a 1440p display it's got better
speakers so this one is just relying on
a bottom speaker right here but it is
quite a bit more expensive but I do
prefer their rounded approach to the
bottom because then when you're using it
you don't have it kind of digging into
you like that it's still got hardware
buttons which is interesting so if
you're someone who was looking for
something that still has hardware
buttons I mean to be clear there's
nothing that I really dislike about it
it just doesn't stand out as anything
special so volume rockers on the right
lock buttons on the right a
reconfigurable button for bixby ah I'm
just kidding it's not for Bixby you can
change it to whatever you want is also
right below that then on the bottom
you've got your hardware buttons as well
as a fingerprint enabled touch home
button with the BlackBerry logo on it
does have a headphone jack type-c and
the speaker that I mentioned before so
the last thing that's kind of cool and
this one actually is pretty neat is when
you've got the camera open you can
either capture like this or you can tap
this button and what it does is it'll
automatically save that picture into
your locker so if you're like you know
heading over to the bathroom or whatever
and you're like you know what my wife
really needs to see a picture of you
know the goods right now you can take
that picture with the BlackBerry button
and then hopefully you have a super
secure messaging
locations that you use blackberry
messenger and you can snap that dick pic
and send it back home for others to
enjoy so that's a feature that I could
see some people definitely getting into
the last thing is that this is another
first for blackberry is that finally
they have caught up to the year 2017
let's see if this works and they have a
water-resistant phone so it's ip67
waterproof capacitive screens they do
not like that they do not like that
water I guess honestly there's not
really much else to say about it overall
in use I actually kind of liked it it's
cheaper than most other flagship
smartphones so it's not available in the
US sorry guys but it's available in the
UK and Canada and it's about six hundred
Canadian dollars so compared to a pixel
- it's about I think with the promo
that's on right now about two hundred
and fifty dollars cheaper so four
thousand million power battery
serviceable camera like definitely a
couple Jen's ago camera good enough
specs like we're at the point now where
if you're not playing a ton of games
honestly a Snapdragon 625 like a mid to
your processor is just fine and a pretty
close to stock Android experience so is
anyone asking for this does anyone need
this I don't know it's like blackberry
reached out offering to send a unit and
I didn't even I didn't even promise to
do a video I was just like yeah I don't
know sure you can turn it over I'll like
try it out and it was a resounding ly
okay phone so I figured you know what
the hey let's do a video what do you
guys think should they even still bother
branding phones blackberry or should
they just give up alright love to hear
