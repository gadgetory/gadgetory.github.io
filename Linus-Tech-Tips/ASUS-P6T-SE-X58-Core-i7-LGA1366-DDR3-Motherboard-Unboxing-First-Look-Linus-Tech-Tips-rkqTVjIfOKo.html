motherboard this is the p6 TSE so p6
would mean it's an LGA 1366 board and se
means it's part of their special edition
and so this is a pretty value-oriented
board so you can see first of all right
off the bat there is no SLI logo so this
is a crossfire board only but it does
support quad crossfire X it's Windows 7
ready it's an X 58 board so that means
it supports the core i7 as well as the
core i7 xtreme so it does not support
core i5 or any of the LGA 1156 CPUs it
has solid capacitors abraded at Wow 57
years at 65 degrees very cool a plus 2
phase power design turbo v it supports
ddr3 up to 2,000 megahertz and it did it
did it to do it has expressed gate which
highly irrelevant ok so let's have a
look at what is on the inside first of
all you've got your i/o shield ok so
that's a fairly standard i/o shield it
is silver as they're little foamy
backing on it very nice you've got Q
connector so I'm guessing this board
doesn't support firewire based on
there's one that's not that's not in
there you've got four SATA cables so two
of them are right angle and two of them
are straight then you have an IDE cable
then you have the user's guide as well
as well there's like a little addendum
in here so LAN port oh no ok this is an
information update for the user guide
that comes with yeah ok so they're
telling me about what it means if the
LEDs are lit on your onboard LAN
ok awesome then you have a driver DVD
which you shouldn't use you should
download the latest off the assist
website and this user guide is all
English so that's a fairly thick user
guide there though not as thick as the P
6 7 or P 67 WS super computer
motherboard alright let's get this thing
open now like I said it's a more value
oriented board but don't get me wrong
this is still a full fledged x58 board
so you're going to find most of the
features that you would come to expect
first of all you've got an LGA 1366
socket right here and the obligatory
support for a triple channel ddr3 memory
ok they've got a warning right here
according to Intel CPU spec dims with
voltage setting over 1.65 may damage the
CPU permanently so you're going to want
to use something like d skills eco Brent
or
rent equal line of memory or anything
else that runs under or at one point six
five volts the lower the better okay so
we've got our on board power switch
right here let's work our way down so
we've got our 24 pin power connector
exactly where it belongs six SATA ports
two of which are coming right off the
board and four of which all of these
running off the chipset are coming out
the side of the board now the reason for
that is that you can see the top PCI
Express 16x connector would run exactly
here so you can access these to run them
up to the top for like an optical drive
or whatever else and then these four you
can use for hard drives perfect then
you've got your IDE connector here is
your chipset then you've got three USB
headers as well as your front panel
connectors then you've got a oh there is
a FireWire connector or header they
don't give you a they don't give you an
adapter for it then there's a spot for a
floppy port but there isn't one on the
board go figure then you have your front
panel audio okay in terms of the PCI
Express configuration on this board
you've got two PCI Express 16 X and I'm
going to go ahead and assume this one
runs at 8 X although I can't see how
many connectors are in there you've got
one PCI Express one X and two PCI slots
you've got your chipset which is
connected by a heat pipe up to your vrm
cooling one of them and then you've got
the other vrm heat sink up here it
doesn't use they're cool like fortress
of solitude style urine coolers but no
that's okay I can kind of let it slide
this time in its ideal location at the
top left of the board you've got your 8
pin power connector okay and I think
that pretty much takes care of
everything on the front of the board did
it did it today yeah I think so ok so
let's have a look at what we've got on
the back panel first of all you've got a
ps2 keyboard and ps2 mouse port that's
the wrong color this is the first time
I've ever seen a ps2 keyboard port
that's like a dark blue rather than like
a light purple totally irrelevant but
interesting nonetheless
ok then we've got six USB 2.0 ports this
is a bit of an older board so you don't
have USB 3.0 support although it's hard
to say how important that is yet you've
got both digital audio interfaces both
coaxial and optical firewire eSATA one
Gigabit Ethernet and seven
one audio thank you for checking on my
unboxing of the P 60 se from Asus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
