2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is Corsair
Vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCI XCOM welcome to the NZXT suite
where we've got a few new products on
display so number one is there hey lady
2v2 series power supplies these are
aiming to bring fully modular power
supplies down to affordable price points
so this right here is a 550 watt power
supply it's 80 plus bronze it has a 100
35-millimeter cooling fan and is of
course I mean if they hadn't managed to
make it fully modular than they wouldn't
have achieved their goal so the idea
here is just that if you want cable
management and you don't need a huge
high wattage power supply and you're
okay with 80 plus bronze then you can
save a few bucks and get a Heil 82 V 2
there's also another version of it the
v2s which is a 750 watt power supply
that will only be available in 220 / 230
volt whichever the voltages countries so
not in my country so let's move on this
right here is the Phantom 530 this is
the first time the phantom has been
redone since well okay well it hasn't
been that long since they've done a new
phantom but this is the first time
they've done what is essentially a
redesign of the original phantom so what
have they changed here number one is you
might notice that the window is bigger
personally I think this is great because
when you're going to buy a flashy pants
case you might as well show off the
flashy pants hardware that you've got
inside it number two is the fact that
they have added a mechanism that allows
you to spin the case around with one hat
weight know it so it doesn't come with
this right oh sorry okay it does not
come with the lazy susan underneath no
but they've widened the chassis a little
bit so this has done a couple of things
that allows them to mount a 140
millimeter fan in the back instead of
just a 120 they've still got that height
adjustable thing that they do as well as
that-that-that-that here in the front
you can do a 200 millimeter cooling fan
down here or you can actually mount some
radiators instead so let's go ahead and
get this bad boy open after we show you
the single channel 30 watt fan
controller so let's go ahead and open
this up don't worry the real one will
will hold on this is hard to do with one
hand you guys there we go
all right so inside there we go so you
can do either single 200 millimeter or
dual 4 140 millimeter or a dual 120
millimeter radiator up in the top you've
got full support for a dual 140
millimeter radiator so that means the
Krakken x 60 is going to fit in here no
problem you've also got support for a
single three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator if you want to do
custom liquid cooling so you can
actually fill this thing up with an
unbelievable amount of radiators which
is even better than the original Phantom
I guess if you're going to redo
something you might as well do it better
you've got metal latches for the five
and a quarter inch base personally this
gives me some confidence but I'm still
going to opt to use the yes there
they're optional screw ins for those
just because you don't want them flying
around during shipping you've also got
three plus two plus one harddrive cages
that are also compatible with SSDs what
I like about these is the fact that
they're modular these are some of these
we're seeing some features here that
have been on higher end and newer NZXT
cases for a while now but remember guys
the Phantom was their first fully custom
designed by NZXT case so there have been
some innovations since then it was
probably time to do this so you can move
these around stack them however you want
and let's move around to the back on the
back we see this this is actually one of
my favorite things that they've started
to do this built-in fan hub so instead
of having to worry about like oh I'm
gonna plug it in there and there and
there and there one switch on the top of
the case changes all your fans 12 volt
seven volt five volt you plug all your
friends into one place that's nice and
hidden so you can bring it back here
they've got like I don't know what it is
like 100 billion little cable loop ties
on the back here so that you can route
all your cables and keep them away from
that large window that's going to make
your system look sexy now let's go over
here where you can actually see that
there are more colors of the Phantom 530
this is white so there's white black and
red at the start and they've got a
prototype product in here that it's kind
of kind of ridiculous so liquid cooling
on graphics cards we've been we've been
seeing this for years I remember
sapphire did like a toxic like 58 70 or
something with an ASA tech liquid cooler
it was a total disaster because
compatibility was a nightmare so what MZ
he's done is they've gone and made it
Universal so with just this bracket
which you get for what like 19 bucks or
something stupid like that 15 bucks
these are dual Titans that are running
this NZXT bracket they're compatible
with any asa tech liquid cooler so this
is just a kraken x 60 running through
the little bracket here and then it
mounts a 92 millimeter fan that cools
the card so they've got dual titans
running in here with a solution that
costs between this cooler in this
bracket less than a hundred bucks which
is definitely less than a liquid cooling
water block I mean that sort of the
flipside of that is Linus well it also
doesn't cool the whole card like a
liquid cooling water block and you blah
blah blah doesn't improve performance
liquid cooling that much actually wrong
because with something like a GTX Titan
with GPU boost 2.0 keeping the card
cooler actually makes it run faster and
the most important part to make it run
cooler is the GPU core itself so this is
an incredibly smart way to address that
particular problem and I guess since
we're here we might as well show you the
black version where they've got some
custom liquid cooling running in here
I'm just going to go ahead and flip this
around let my camera go check this out
so there's a 240 millimeter liquid
cooler they're three hundred and sixty
millimeter up here and then a couple of
sort of more traditional full-coverage
GPU water blocks which leads us finally
to a very awkward change in position
between me and my camera and everyone in
the Suites like running around to get
out of my way here this is the h2 30 it
is available in black or white and it is
generally very similar to the h2 a quiet
optimized case so you've got noise
dampened panels in here you've got a
removable cage right here all the drives
are actually mounted from Reverse so
you've got six two and a half or three
and a half inch drives full ATX
motherboard support and I personally
really like the bezel design I think it
looks really clean and I mean I guess
that's all there really is to say about
it
looks clean very nice and I think that
pretty much wraps it up guys don't miss
any of our Computex 2013 coverage we are
sponsored here at the show by Western
Digital as well as Corsair Vengeance
gaming peripherals and of course NCI
XCOM don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos evidently I was
wrong that is an X 40 not an X 60
clearly you cannot fit
a 280 millimeter liquid cooler in the
front of the case sideways if you could
we'd be looking at like a cube case and
this is clearly not one of those also I
made a bit of a mistake so NZXT T's
point was not that with an X 40 and this
bracket you could get it for under $100
because that would cost a little more
than $100 but it's compatible with other
ace attack om liquid coolers even from
the likes of Corsair such as the age 50
so if you're grabbed an age 50 paired it
up with the NZXT bracket then you could
liquid cooling your graphics card for
under $100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
