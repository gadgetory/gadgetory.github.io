more welcome to my video about the HTC
one max this phone review will be a
little bit shorter than most of mine
because it's pretty much a phone that
I've reviewed before unlike the one mini
with its mini size and mini specs
compared to the regular one the one max
is and I suppose this was
self-explanatory I mean a max sized
version of the one there's no massive
change in the specs though it's got a
1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon 600 processor
with an Adreno 320 GPU 2 gigs of ram a
5.9 inch 1080p screen that's about 373
pixels per inch with Gorilla Glass 3
Wi-Fi AC and Android 4.3 with a 4.4
kitkat update confirmed with those
numbers in mind doing this review was a
little weird it's the first time a one
device has ever felt anything but
blindingly fast to me it's still very
fast but going from the Nexus 5 to the
one made me appreciate the subtle
all-round difference that a faster phone
running a newer more lightweight OS can
make it didn't bother me for the last
few weeks but I definitely did notice it
so we'll start with the physical on
hands on HTC actually sent me a case as
well as a stylus for the phone the case
well I installed it used it for like two
minutes and then I promptly put it down
behind a barn with a shotgun no but
seriously I seem to have lost it so I
actually can't show it to you but I
would suggest trying to find something
else anyway the stylus is a stylus I
guess it's aluminium and it feels nice
but my issue is that unlike the note 3
there's nowhere to store it inside the
phone body so unless you have amazing
discipline I think you're going to be
losing and buying it over and over again
and at ten dollars that's a little bit
tough to swallow so I decided after
trying the stylus to just go bareback
with no stylus for the duration of my
review because I feel like that's how
most people are going to be using it
earlier this year when I first started
using it I feel
the regular one to be a bit too big for
me I was coming from an iPhone 4 and a
bit slippery with it's however beautiful
it may be smooth anodized aluminum
backing now fast forward however many
months it's been and that's all changed
I'm used to the one but moving up to the
one max is that same learning curve all
over again you've got to be extremely
careful especially at first to avoid
dropping it fortunately I didn't I mean
for someone like me with small hands you
have got to use both of them to handle
this baby day-to-day if you know what I
mean but well you know what they say
practice makes perfect and over the last
few weeks I've gotten a lot better at
handling a big the front of the phone is
dominated by the huge 5.9 inch screen
and the boom sound speakers man I missed
those speakers when I was using the
Xperia z1 in the Nexus 5 it is so nice
to actually be able to hear things again
and have them playing at me as opposed
to coming out of the bottom of the phone
into my palm I mean using the one for so
long I had actually started taking them
for granted but now that I've been on
the other side I have a new appreciation
for them the last thing on the front of
the phone is the dedicated buttons
rather than on-screen buttons now I feel
like these are a bit of a mixed bag I at
first felt very strongly that on-screen
buttons were a negative because they
took up some of your screen real estate
but particularly on a phone like this
having on-screen buttons is a non-issue
to me because the screen is so big
actually many modern phones are like
that and whereas having hard buttons
those that makes the phone itself a
little bit bigger which is something
that doesn't really feel necessary in
this case so it comes down to the
individual whether you prefer on screen
or not on screen I'm kind of in the
middle on the right we find my single
biggest gripe with this phone the volume
and lock buttons are so close together
and so similar feeling but even after a
couple of weeks it's pretty much a 50/50
shot for me to hit what I'm aiming for a
top lock button like on the one I
understand why they didn't do that it
would have been very difficult to to hit
one
handed butt so that's maybe not the
solution but I think a different feel to
these buttons on the side could have
helped a lot here it's still not a
deal-breaker and overall I actually
really like the phone it's just that a
couple weeks in it does continue to
bother me and I wish they'd found
another way to implement that moving on
to the bottom of the phone we find a
single micro USB charging port
I feel like wireless charging is a very
conspicuous absentee here especially
with newer phones like the Nexus 5
having that as a headline feature in
fact that's one of the biggest things I
miss about the Nexus 5 wireless charging
is a truly next-generation type
experience shift compared to plugging in
your phone all the time so there you go
guys it's not here but hopefully the
upcoming 1/2 or whatever they're going
to call it will on the top we find an IR
emitter yay universal remote and a
headphone jack then on the back we find
the ultra pixel camera which just like
the one has strong image stabilization
and is easy to get good stills with even
in low-light but has a little bit of
difficulty with autofocus and video mode
so I'm it tends to kind of look for
focus a lot but maybe we'll see a
software update for that I mean you see
how much the Nexus 5 camera improved
just with a software update so maybe
there's still hope for it on the back we
also find a fingerprint scanner that I
had on for about an hour before I gave
up I think a big part of the issue for
me was that to get a solid scan you can
only really do it if you can reach it
properly and consistently pull your
finger across it in a repeatable manner
and that required me to hold the phone
with two hands now
I don't mind operating the phone
two-handed but being able to unlock it
one-handed to quickly look at things is
a must for me let's move back to the
front of the phone and take some time to
really talk about the screen the viewing
angles are solid I can't see the
touchscreen interface even on uniform
backgrounds which is a personal pet
peeve of mine and while it lacks some of
the sharpness of the 4.7 inch 1080p
screen on the one unless you're reading
very small text from very close up all
day I doubt you would ever even notice
that I think the only
plaint that I really have about it is
the slight warm or yellow cast of the
colors compared to the one especially
which has a more cool or blue look
although even that stopped bothering me
after about the first day it is still
obvious and a side-by-side comparison
though now on to these size there are
definite challenges associated with
handling a six inch but I think we can
all agree that having such a big clear
screen is great for certain things
content consumption is an example lately
I've been mostly using my Nvidia shield
for watching videos in bed or around the
house but the one max due to its massive
screen and great speakers has actually
taken over that duty I also find myself
zooming in less on photos that I'm
viewing on the phone when I hand it to
people to take a picture or a video for
me they often comment that they can see
really clearly and it's easy to use and
and these things are great I mean but
initially I didn't necessarily feel like
my appreciation for those things
outweighed the inconvenience of the
largeness because of my of my small
hands and in fact initially my review
notes about the phone's ludicrous eyes
included only stories like my wife's
cousin laughing at me when I was talking
on it just because it's so big and I had
some negative stuff about little places
where since 5.5 didn't make use of the
additional screen size for general
productivity like for example in the app
tray and things we're going to come out
a bit negative although in HTC's defense
while the app tray displays exactly as
many icons in the grid as the one and
even the one mini most stuff is is
adapted reasonably well like the
launcher supports a full additional row
and column of icons and stuff like that
so so that was a very minor complaint
but anyway that's the direction I was
headed then about three days into my
evaluation of the phone something
happened I was standing in an office
texting someone and a middle-aged lady
behind the desk nearby said to me wow
what phone is that I showed it to her
and she proceeded to play around with it
and tell
a story about how her kids made her get
an iPhone and she hates it because she
can't see anything on it or type
anything on it because it's just too
small for her to press the buttons and I
realized she's right
typing even though it does require two
hands for me to grip the phone and use
it at the same time is an absolute dream
on the one max without thinking about it
I had forgotten to install Swift key
because even with my small hands and
HTC's unexceptional stock keyboard I was
faster with less reliance on autocorrect
and I'm a reasonably good touchscreen
typist so I think that's my new summary
about the size while I can use this
phone and there are things I do like
about it that trade-off of screen size -
phone size wasn't necessarily designed
for people like me who want information
density and compactness it was made for
people who might legitimately need a big
screen for ease of use where large
display elements will be perfect and I
can I can think of a lot of people like
that software wise I've used sense for
months so there weren't really any
surprises here but I'll summarize some
of the things I do and don't like about
it
swiping down from the top with one or
two fingers for your notifications or
for your quick toggles is good I like
HTC's quick toggles implementation it
doesn't have 3,000 things in it like
Samsung's but it doesn't just lock you
into half a dozen basic things at once
you will not use anything else like
stock Android however I do still use
power toggles just because I
particularly with a large phone like
this have trouble getting two fingers up
there
one-handed when if I just want to turn
on my flashlight and I'm kind of
scrambling it's nice to be able to just
scroll down with one and activate the
flashlight with one hand just like that
HTC's phone migration wizard is wireless
and easy to use something I wouldn't
have even mentioned and would take for
granted if I hadn't tried Sony's
terrible ones so recently I also love
senses multitasking compared to other
implementations like the stock Google
one that only shows a few recently
opened applications or requires
scrolling blinkfeed is something that
people either use or don't use I don't
use it but I can recognize it as an
efficient way to
look at all your social media feeds and
stuff like that it's just not for me
those are another thing that I don't
really use because to me they're kind of
like vines without even a button to cut
pause recording they're just little time
limited video clips for those of you who
don't know what a zou is and the one Max
can record regular videos so I'd like to
just have the option to keep it short
just a few seconds or keep it rolling
highlight reel another software feature
one that I actually do use from time to
time lets you put together quick videos
and it does automatic cuts and filters
and stuff like that set to music and
that works with those or regular videos
so those feel a little bit unnecessary
and and like you're limiting yourself a
little bit now one other thing and I've
already been informed that this isn't a
big deal and lots of phones do it but
whatever this is my first time noticing
it is that even if your phone battery is
dead the one and the one acts for that
matter will turn on for a long enough to
trigger your alarm in the morning this
is great if you're like me and
occasionally forget to plug in your
phone before going to sleep when it's
really really low this feature actually
saved my butt one day during this review
and I would have otherwise slept in so
that's something that I did want to
mention overall I like the software
maybe it's partly because my first
Android experience is with since 5.5 so
it's very familiar to me but there was
one thing that I really missed from the
Moto X and the Nexus 5 okay Google
you've won me over on the whole voice
thing Google now integration with 4.3
and the one is just not as good or as
intuitive as those other phones and even
though at the time I didn't feel like I
was using it much even just trying to
use maps for navigation on the one I
really really missed it so the summary
is I guess I'll write my obligatory the
voice quality on the one max is
excellent I guess like the speaker's
it's a side effect of having more space
inside the device and the fact that the
microphone can actually be quite close
to your mouth so I felt like I should
mention that but other than that the
conclusion of this video is quite simple
if you liked the one but you felt like
it needed to have a bigger battery in
screen then this is pretty much your
dream phone
okay no it has some other differences
upgradable story just one of them
I like the implementation of the
removable back there is a very slight
gap but it doesn't detract from the
overall fit and finish to me that's a
trade-off I'm willing to make moving on
to the summary and conclusion are always
sorry hold on
voice quality on the one max I guess it
is it is a phone is excellent I guess
like the speakers being better because
you know it's just like bigger and
easier to build good sound devices and a
bigger space off I guess it's a side
effect of the phone just being larger
but it was definitely a strong point for
the phone okay there sorry now now
conclusion time so other than that the
conclusion for this video is quite
simple if you liked the one but you felt
like it needed to have a bigger battery
and screen then this is pretty much your
dream phone okay no it has some other
differences as well I mean the
upgradable storage is one big one and I
actually like the implementation of the
removable back there is a slight gap
here but I don't feel like it detracts
from the overall fit and finish that
much they've added a very very small lip
like on the one mini to I guess help
prevent screen scratching if you put it
face down but it really is very small
and I still wouldn't put it face down on
things
either way it's a welcome addition both
the haptic feedback and the vibrate
ringtone feel less high-pitched and
obnoxious to me so yeah there are some
definite improvements and with that in
mind I would say the one max is a better
phone than the one but to me it doesn't
come down to those little changes it
comes down to whether you feel like you
can handle all five point nine inches of
its strong sculpted anyway guys like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment letting
me know if you think tablets like the
one Mac's are great or if you think that
they're stupid I'm you know let the
debate rage on in the YouTube comments
