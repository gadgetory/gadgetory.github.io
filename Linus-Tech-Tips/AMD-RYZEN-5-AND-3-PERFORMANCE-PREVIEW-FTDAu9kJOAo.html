been or when I've returned from the
far-off time of q3 2017 after the
launches of AMD's risin 5 and risin 3
and oh you don't want to know what
happens between now and then but anyway
that's not important right now what is
important is I've brought back a little
souvenir welcome to our early preview of
risin 3 and rise in 5
the Phoenix auteur is a full-sized
minimalistic li designed keyboard
complete with Cherry MX switches and a
new white backlit variant check it out
at the link below okay okay so I'm no
dark brown and I Drive a Lambo not a
DeLorean so we should just get this out
of the way right now we don't actually
have a rise in five or a rise in three
chip or do we no no we don't this right
here is our rise in seven 1800 X and
what we are going to do is use our
motherboard BIOS to match the core
counts and frequencies that AMD has
announced and see how they might stack
up you may have your doubts about this
method but we've demonstrated in the
past that it works shockingly well in
this video here so which chips will we
be testing then well aside from our rise
in seven 1800 X and 1700 X as real-world
baselines and a core i7 7700 K to
represent the blue team we're taking the
rise in five 1600 X and 1400 X and the
rise of three 1200 X for a spin we'll be
doing it all with our replacement Asus
crosshair 6 based rise in test bench and
as for our GPU we'll be testing with our
new FPS per dollar high performance King
the GTX 1080 Ti now considering that the
highest clock rise in five CPU is still
a 3.6 gigahertz base 4 gigahertz booth
chip the same as the 1800 X we're pretty
certain that we're not going to see any
performance difference in
single-threaded tasks with the 1600 X
making it slower in multi-threaded
workloads but potentially a wicked
gaming chip
there are some things to keep in mind
with these tests as AMD's precision
boost is disabled the moment a custom
frequency is set we've had to lock the
frequencies of our slower clock virtual
CPUs since precision boost and excess
are only kicked in in lightly threaded
workloads in our testing we chose to
split the difference between their base
frequencies and maximum XF our clocks
that is 3.75 gigahertz for the 1400 X
and 3.6 gigahertz for the 1200 X this
clearly isn't 100% accurate particularly
since that puts our lower end chips
running at a higher base frequency while
at full loads it should still give us a
ballpark representation for our overall
performance analysis across all of our
tests finally we're uncertain at this
time whether disabling cores on Rison
also disables extra cash so do keep that
in mind
with all that boring stuff out of the
way now though let's kick it off with
our gaming benchmarks today at 1080p
since these are mid-range CPUs that were
simulating we see our virtual 1600 X
performing better in Deus Ex mankind
divided than the lower clocks but
pricier 1700 X rise of the Tomb Raider
shows us more of the same while for
honor shows our 1400 X also performing
well with its higher base frequency
sadly an artifact of our methodology
since risin doesn't boost for that long
at full load GTA 5 clearly will take all
the cores and cycles it can get while
Ghost Recon wildlands on the other hand
shows only the i7 7700 caves
single-threaded performance pulling away
with a measurable lead doom gives the
7700 K a much more significant lead with
the Rison series making a pretty linear
slope after that and finally like GTA 5
Crysis 3 shows again a first for
everything
with our 1200 X
falling far behind thanks to its mere
four cores and four threads
moving on to synthetics 3d mark shows
our risin platform generally
outperforming the 7700 K until we get
all the way to our quad course and the
same is true of 7-zip where even our
1600 X outperforms it's more expensive
Intel rival PC mark is another highlight
for AMD the 1600 X's performance is
close to the 1800 X and another instance
where our methodology benefited our 1400
X in a way that won't quite hold true in
the real world the 1600 X again falls
ahead in the single threaded y cruncher
test but our multi-threaded test brings
us closer to our kind of linear slope
Cinebench 2 shows us a fairly
predictable results except for the i7
which only beats the much cheaper quad
core rise in chips rounding our test out
asus real bench shows us its preference
for a clock speed for image editing
thread count on encoding and a
combination of the two in heavy
multitasking with our benches stacking
up accordingly but to put all that
performance stuff in the appropriate
perspective we need to look at pricing
at 249 the 1600 X seems to hit the sweet
spot with its 1800 X like performance in
everything but our most multi-threaded
benchmarks the 1400 X at 169 seems like
a really solid value too considering its
thread parity with our i7 and decent
scoring which lends it at the top of the
pack for performance per dollar the 1200
X rumored at 149 is well Andy's
marketing is all about thread count and
with only four Rison just isn't pulling
quite as much weight however at that
price it's actually our second best
performer per dollar placing it in an
excellent position for
budget CPU and if you've watched our
rise in OSI guide you're probably
thinking that this one is actually much
closer to the Athlon XP 2500 plus than
the 1700 X and you wouldn't necessarily
be wrong though something our eight core
processor cannot simulate is how hot
these chips will run or how well they'll
overclock
so that all remains to be seen so with
all of that said then we have to stress
again that this isn't an exact
measurement in particular our 1,400 X
and 1200 X cores are likely suffering
from the loss of precision boost but
taken with a grain of salt these results
should paint a pretty clear and pretty
exciting picture one that we can't wait
to verify against the real deal though
tax Magna C and 10 series is one of the
smallest VR ready gaming pcs available
measuring at just eight point two seven
by seven by two point four five inches
it's quiet while operating and it's
lightweight at less than eight pounds
making it genuinely portable you can
even get it with an nvidia gtx 1070 to
go along with it skylake core i5 6400 t
its dual hdmi 2.0 ports and its
compatibility for high-speed nvme SSDs

thanks for watching guys if this video
stuck just like it if it was good then
we'll I can't get subscribed for more
videos like it and check out the link to
where to buy the stuff we featured in
