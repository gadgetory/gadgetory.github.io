carbine series 400 our case here you can
see a kind of blown-up view of the case
and while I could show you all of the
features on here
I am not really going to do that because
we're going to open up the case anyway
and I would rather show you on the
actual chassis itself right now I'm just
showing you the blocks because this is
an unboxing although I don't like to
think of them as just unboxings because
unboxings are usually pretty dry to be
honest so right now I'm making an
incision on this side now I'm making it
sitting on the other side now I'm really
excited about what's inside this box and
I think that you guys will be excited
too because yes pretty this is pretty
cool look at this oh wow a box um so you
know what I'm not going to make you guys
sit through that give me two seconds I'm
going to get the case extracted from the
padding I just want to show you guys the
styrofoam packaging so they've gone with
sort of thin here but up to an about an
inch plus thick on the sides and then on
the top we're looking at about the same
thickness well look at that about an
inch or even more depending on which
part of the case is being supported by
the foam inserts they are using a stiff
foam this is a value case so Corsair has
gone with saving a little bit of money
on the packaging compared to their more
expensive cases like the 650d or the 800
d so the first thing I noticed about
this case was that it has a pretty
robust carrying handle on the top of it
we'll go ahead and put that down there
so you can kind of see nice and deep so
even if you have long fingers you're
going to be able to get a good grip on
that on the top we find dual 120
millimeter fans or dual 140 millimeter
fans and what's cool is the way Corsair
has faced this out it's so that you can
actually put the fans right next to each
other for a clean aesthetic whether
they're 120 or whether they're 140
because they have expanded the 140
compatibility out the other side rather
than spacing the sorry about that guys
we ran out of space and all the footage
on there was important so I don't really
remember where I left off yesterday but
here we are so it has the carrying
handle we talk
about that it has the fan spacing which
is pretty ideal I believe we talked
about that briefly let's do a bit of an
overview of the outside of the case as a
whole so in addition to those dual 120 s
or dual 140 s on the top we've also got
dual 120 s or dual 140 s here on the
side so this is going to give you a ton
a buttload so to speak of airflow over
your CPU area as well as your video card
area and then on the back other cooling
options we've also got a 120 or 140
millimeter fan mount whichever you
choose to go with one two three four
five six seven eight look at that this
is one of the least expensive cases I've
yet seen that has eight expansion slots
so that's will allow you even with a
standard ATX board you can sometimes use
eight expansion slots because if you
have a PCIe slot right at the bottom you
can then install a dual slot a dual with
graphics card in that very bottom slot
without any difficulty so that's not
pretty cool okay on the other side we
see that the overall design of the case
favors a narrow narrower footprint to
the case and then a widening of the side
panels for better cable routing better
cable management that's one of the
things Corsair is good about they have
good aesthetic to their cases but they
also really do take functionality into
consideration when they are designing
these things so on the front we've got
our power button our hard drive led two
USB 3.0 ports a microphone port
headphone port firewire port now that's
an odd one but hey I guess some people
still use it that looks like some kind
of an LED button hmm okay and then
finally we have a reset button for five
and a quarter inch bays which is a good
number and then in the front we've got
another two 120 millimeter fans which we
can see through that that mesh on the
front so this is definitely a coolers
dream because one two three four surface
four of the six sir
of this case actually have room to mount
cooling fans and by four what I meant
was five because you can clearly see on
the bottom here there is room to mount
yet another single one twenty millimeter
or single 140 millimeter fan and I
forgot to turn on my lights of animus on
them should be a little bit better for
you guys alright what else do we find
inside this is interesting the
motherboard tray is actually recessed so
what they've done here is they've taken
what is normally a flat backplane on a
case like this and here I'm going to
hold up the side panel just so that I
can show you guys so you can kind of
relate this to the side panel on the
other side so where the side panel
doesn't jut out as much we've gone with
a flat like like a they've gone with
something that's even with the overall
profile of the case and then where the
side panel bulges out so where it bulges
out like this
they've recessed the motherboard tray so
throughout the entire back of the
motherboard tray and then back behind
here behind the rubber grommets you
should have consistent space for
managing cables very very interesting
something I haven't seen before
standard ATX only so you're not going to
be able to fit any wider motherboards or
longer motherboards due to that design
decision but I mean 99% of boards out
there are going to fit just fine anyway
so I wouldn't worry too much about it
we've also got on the inside okay so we
pointed out the 120mm fan already
these are going to be useful for you so
you're going to go ahead and mount your
bottom mounted power supply here we've
got a removable filter that acts as both
a filter for this fan intake as well as
the power supply bottom 120 millimeter
intake rubber grommets here keep the
power supply from being damaged or
scratched or moving around alright so
you're going to be able to route all
your cables up through here and then
coming out wherever they are needed
speaking of cables coming out where
there
need it these are your front panel
connectors so I'm go ahead and see if I
can remove the cover on here and I'm not
having a whole lot of success just neat
just now but I think I've made progress
yes I have there we are
alright so we find USB three HD audio
front panel so there's all your switches
and LEDs and finally your front firewire
or 1394 as PC guys are supposed to call
it last but not least we've got a power
connector so I'm guessing that something
to do with that light button there
alright in terms of mounting we've got
five and a quarter inch tool list mounts
here you also have the option of
screwing them in both at the front and
the back if you are shipping the system
or whatever else you want it to be more
secure you're going to go ahead and do
that we've got here six mounts for both
three and a half inch using two lists
dramedy things here as well as two and a
half inch using screws hard drive sleds
in terms of accessories I'm going to go
ahead and have a look at what's included
here in this box oh that's so funny look
at this it's the size and shape it's
like a hard drive placeholder kind of
thing it's got holes on the side for
your hard drive we'll put it in there
brilliant I guess alright oh oh this is
a great inclusion USB 3 2 USB 2 adapter
so if you don't have USB 3 on your
motherboard natively you go ahead throw
that on there you plug this into USB 2
header you got USB 2 on the front handy
all right we got some screws down screws
how many of they included one two three
four one two three four so enough to
mount a three fans so I wonder what
under which particular mounts those are
for because usually these are used for
mounting fans to radiators there's ones
with the long bolts and then the screws
in the front if you guys have any
insight as to why they've included this
particular type of fan screw I would
love to hear about it so there you go
alright next we've got some hard drive
screws we've got some optical drive
screws we've got some power supply
screws
cable management zip ties and little
plastic clips and finally a few
motherboard standoffs because most of
them other board standoffs are already
built into the case now I've talked a
lot about the cable management of this
case but this is all based on sort of my
impressions of what it might be like
because I haven't opened up the other
side panel yet so I'm going to go ahead
and do that now and we're going to find
it if I was right so I'm going to lay
that down like that so you can kind of
see if I was on the right track here so
yes so there's more room here due to
this the indentation of the back of the
tray and then there's less room for two
here so it works up probably about the
same as here where there's the Bulge and
here where the motherboard sits a little
bit further back so I'm guessing what
Corsair is done here is two things
they've given you room to manage cables
at the back and they've done a nice thin
case that also has room for tall CPU
heat sinks they've also given you a very
large hole at the back of the
motherboard tray in order to install any
backplate requiring CPU heat sinks or
water cooling units without removing
your motherboard they've shown you how
to use the cable management here lots of
little loops here for securing zip ties
here here okay that's pretty much it not
much here but then the only thing you're
going to write up here is your 8 pin TPS
which they've left space for and I think
that pretty much covers it so thank you
