stereoscopic 3d blu-ray the
entertainment industry pushes a
revolutionary new media format down our
throats with promises that it will
completely change the way we enjoy our
movies about once every 10 years
but while DVD promised very mainstream
benefits over VHS in addition to better
image quality more convenient storage
increased longevity and no rewinding
blu-rays adoption has been challenged at
every stage from HD DVD and the less
obvious image quality benefits versus
DVD on the average viewers TV in the
early days - the cost and convenience
advantages of online streaming today so
does 4k blu-ray offer up an obvious
enough benefit to bring online streaming
aficionados back to physical media or
failing that is it at least enough to
prompt enthusiasts to upgrade let's talk
about that
mass drop is hosting a drop for the high
five n 8350 headphones which you can get
for $99.99 u.s. dollars check it out at
the link in the video description
let's open up with the gear that you'll
need to enjoy your shiny new 4k blu-rays
4k blu-rays use the BD excel format
which can hold up to a hundred and
twenty eight gigs on a triple-layer disk
but it isn't backwards compatible so
you'll need a new player we chose the
Xbox one s since add no support isn't
terribly important to anyone without a
redonkulous speaker set up in a
dedicated theater room and it costs the
same as the standalone players anyway
while having much more functionality
next you'll need a 4k TV HDR support
strongly preferred as we'll get into in
more depth later I'll be using LG's
signature g6 65 inch OLED since it's one
of if not the best home HD our
experiences at the moment and
representative of what will be more
widely available in the year or two to
come after that you will need more
expensive 4k blu-ray discs we chose
these movies because we wanted to
experience many of the different types
of original formats that could be
converted to 4k blu-ray and finally
you'll need the as-yet uncracked hdcp
2.2 support at every link in your data
chain which usually means a special port
or two on the back of your receiver and
TV plus some faffing about Sims from my
experience it is buggy as heck at the
moment I actually ended up taking my
receiver out of the mix halfway through
our session because it just stopped
handshaking with the Xbox 1's now let's
talk about the test our resident Cinema
dork Brandon and I shut the blinds and
chained ourselves to my couch for the
better part of a day doing everything
from watching longer uninterrupted
chunks of the films to pausing as close
to the same frames as we could and pixel
peeping at least that's what we did once
we finished bickering over what settings
to use on the TV
for HDR it was simple since all the
normal picture profile modes are
replaced with three HDR ones we just
turned off obvious nonsense like clear
motion and edge enhancement and set it
to HDR for a dark room but for our
standard blu-ray comparison system a PC
playing lossless MKV rips over the
network in MPC HC we eventually settled
on the ISF expert dark mode with neutral
color temperature all those enhancements
off and either standard or wide color
gamut depending on the film more on that
later
first up the lego movie the first
blu-ray HDR experience for either of us
since this was our first crack at a B
evaluation we ended up trying to tune
the non HDR image in TV quite a bit to
get the most fair comparison this was
one movie where wide color gamut got
blu-ray close to the vibrancy of HDR
without looking like best buy TV
syndrome but what our compensations
lacked was subtlety in this scene the
HDR version looks like a blueish shadow
on a gray Street the Blu ray looks like
a blue Street as for the 4k upsampling
there is a difference in wide shots with
distant text or objects but from a
normal viewing distance I would describe
it as not a huge deal
next up Sicario we found our wide gamut
setting was overpowering in this film
and went back to normal in this night
scene the higher bitrate and increased
color depth give the sky a more natural
less bandit appearance and in this one
the parking lot of the bars darkness and
the brightness of the lights make the
bar seem like a beacon or an oasis more
than just a building
HDR had a true emotional impact moving
indoors again the difference is there in
the vibrancy of the sign on the
character's right as she walks in and in
the lighting on our character's face as
she sits at the bar in the blu-ray
version it looks like there's a light
shining on her face in
HDR she is clearly lit in multiple
colors from multiple different sources
just like she would be if she was
sitting in a bar the revenant was a
funny one for us as a movie that was
mostly shot in natural light at native
4k we were expecting to be blown away
and we did get a difference I mean look
at the difference in color in the burned
church scene here between blu-ray and 4k
blu-ray but we also observed that we
could compensate for a lot of that
difference by shifting the tint of the
TV to minus 23 and in the bear scene we
saw the same thing again leading us to
agree on a couple of things one that 4k
resolution on the disc itself had a
negligible impact to the viewing
experience and that HDR didn't affect
the appearance of the lighting nearly as
much as we'd expected it wasn't until a
fire lit scene that our tin tak was
defeated and the HDR version flexed its
range muscles but even then while the
teal cast of the first two scenes may
have been closer to the director's
vision the more blue like appearance
unlike in Sicario didn't affect the
emotional impact of the scene though to
be clear this isn't so much a criticism
of the HDR master as much as it is
praised for the blu-ray master the 4k
version of the amazing spider-man 2 is
simply put a disappointment in
side-by-side comparisons sure the cop
cars are a little whiter and the shadows
are a little deeper but for a 35
millimeter film to 4k digital scan I was
expecting more than just more accurate
representation of the filmic look we
both were amazing spider-man 2 was
easily the low point of our HDR day
which is okay because our last title
Life of Pi made us immediately forget
about it
holy actual balls this movie looks like
the difference between a competent if
unexceptional color grading job and
turning the TV
into a window into a completely
different reality in my living room the
visual difference once again isn't in
the increased resolution which makes
sense since it's up sampled from a 2k
master but rather from the incredible
difference in the way the scenes
lighting looks cloth shadows skin tones
this is the first movie that's made me
sip and go Wow
now that I've seen the HDR version I
have no desire whatsoever to settle for
the blu-ray words don't do it justice
it's absolutely beautiful which leads us
pretty well into the conclusion which is
a little complicated first the good
while I'm still not sold on 4k from a
normal viewing distance until home tvs
are a hundred inches or greater HDR is
not a gimmick no amount of tooling
around with your TV's menu can simulate
its effects across an entire film and we
did try my TV's fake Oh simulated HDR
mode and done right it dramatically
improves the movie viewing experience
and I'll be surprised if streaming HDR
can compete with 4k blu-ray HDR since
traditional blu-ray already blows
streaming out of the water in terms of
color depth though I'd love to be proven
wrong here second up some big problems
so first the increased cost versus the
benefit is the highest we've ever seen
with only a V nerds and movie buffs
likely to be able to tell the difference
without a side-by-side comparison
sorry to all of you guys but most of the
world doesn't calibrate their TV and
uses the built-in speakers and second if
we're being honest it's not actually
here yet there's always that transition
period every time where we have a new
standard where the hardware is like sort
of there and the standards are like sort
of there but the content needs time to
catch up and in this case even the
content that does exist well frankly
most of it doesn't benefit from it in
the way that content a year or two from
now will so for now
now then I'd say the money is better
spent on almost anything else
calibrating your existing TV buying
literally twice as many movies or even a
comfy couch I do plan to invest in it
eventually when more than you know one
out of five discs that I buy feel like I
really got my money's worth but I will
also be waiting for hdcp 2.2 to be
cracked so that I'm not paying extra for
the privilege of putting physical media
into a slot instead of streaming
everything off of mine as tunnel there
is the simple VPN app that makes it easy
to browse privately and enjoy a more
open Internet whatever products it is
that you want to buy on Amazon or
anywhere else yes my friends tunnel bear
makes it so the services and websites
