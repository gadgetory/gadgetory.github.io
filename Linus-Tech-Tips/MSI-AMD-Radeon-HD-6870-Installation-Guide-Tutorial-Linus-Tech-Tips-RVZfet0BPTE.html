little while back but I thought I'd do
one for the Radeon 6870 since in my
opinion it's going to be a very popular
card so the first thing you're going to
want to do is make sure that you have
enough space in your case and that is
means in terms of length so if you have
hard drive cages that are positioned
just to the right of your motherboard or
if you have any other obstacles that
might be there
the 6870 is about the length of a
motherboard so it should be fit in fact
it is exactly the length of a
motherboard standard you can't
motherboard so it should be fairly easy
but ok not quite exactly I'm sorry it's
just like almost exactly there you can
see how close it is so it should be
fairly easy to eyeball based on that
whether there is enough room in your
case another thing to bear in mind is
this is a dual slot card and you're
going to want the next one over free or
at least okay so let's say here's the
arising you've got the card installed
here in the top slot okay and then
there's one in the next one but it's
like a short one like that killer NIC
right there as long as that fan has
breathing room you should be in pretty
good shape some of the fan down there
all right so that's another thing to
bear in mind you do need two slots so
you got two mounting screw points right
there other things you will need you
will need two PCI Express six pin power
connectors so in my case that is check
and check these are both six plus two
pins so they can be plugged into either
a six pin or an eight pin slot on the
graphics card so from there you take off
the screws which I have already done all
go to toggle okay take off your side
panel which I've already done you take
off your screws which I have apparently
already done you position the card after
grounding yourself which means touching
the power supply while it's plugged into
the wall as a cat okay so you position
it above the slot making sure that
you've here's a common mistake make sure
this metal part right here isn't
pressing into the motherboard when you
go to push it in you see there's a
little tiny gap back there
make sure it's in the gap make sure it's
not pushing into the board I've done
that
usually bad results okay so you
positioned above the slot and then push
firmly I'm going to use my camera hand
in addition to my other hand push firmly
on the entire card until it sits into
the slot okay so you'll be able to see
now it's there's a little bit of wiggle
room but it's pretty much in there so
you should use two screws to secure this
particular card one goes here I'm using
thumb screws lots of different cases
have lots of different mounting
mechanisms how would I tend to do is I
give the card a bit of a lift as I'm
screwing it in so what that does is it
make sure that I don't have any undue
weight or strain being left on the
socket okay and then the screw threading
is broken on my case I just push the
screw and that's all I can really do
there that says that's as in as it goes
all right then we connect the power
connectors which is pretty
straightforward hide those extra two
pins and that's it that's my 6870
installation guide you have now
installed a Radeon 6870 enjoy your
DirectX 10 gaming performance featuring
the MSI 6870 we've even got like an
afterburner ad on their card it's a good
piece of software but yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
