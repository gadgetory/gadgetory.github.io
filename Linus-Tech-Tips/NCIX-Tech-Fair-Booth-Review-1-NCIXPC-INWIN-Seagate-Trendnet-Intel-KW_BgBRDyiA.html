do a tour or all of the boots so we're
going to break it up a little bit but
we're starting here you dream it we
build it NCIX pc can build pretty much
anything gaming rigs workstations home
or office and even servers so at the
booth today rather than just focusing on
the NCIX pcs themself because we have
about six of them spread out at all the
various vendor booths we actually
decided to do a very unique demo we have
one of our and head technicians Ryan who
is going to be doing a live demo of how
to build your very own PC every hour on
the hour then you can browse our line of
events di hpc systems here and in the
background you can also see this guy got
familiar only that is what I think early
as line at Tatham so he's also
showcasing some of the NCIX pcs that
have been designed by the crazy Russian
himself and usually these dental ones
are a joint collaborative project to
make them look as good as positive
between the Russian and Brian right here
all right we're here at the inn win
booth so they've got a variety of
different new products on display
their series 550 watt power supply as
well as their 1200 watt commander 2 so
this is an evolutionary step forward
from the original commander and you can
see that while a lot of companies are
doing military colored themed components
these days actually no one else does a
power supply so if you're going to buy
yourself a sabertooth motherboard and
some noctua fans and go for like kind of
a you know urban sort of look inside
your pc then this might not actually be
a bad choice at all because it's like i
said an army green kind of thing going
on so send me modular power supply and
let's move on to the case so for cases
we've got the dragonriders this one
comes in white or black is actually one
of the most complete options of front
panel connectors I have ever seen with
microphone headphones to USB 3 2 USB two
firewire 400 and to esata ports all on
the top case you can also see there's a
22 centimeters side panel fan as well as
noise dampening material on the rest of
the inside and what's cool about this as
well is hold on a second yep as well as
the fact that it has a switch for the
fan right on the side so that's
hardwired into the case this is an XL
ATX case it has 8 expansion slots and
it's holy water cooling ready with 2 120
millimeter 2 x 120 millimeter radiator
supported in the top it also uses a rail
sliding mechanism for the hard drive and
this is a cool feature that we've seen
only a couple times before with an
additional cooling fan on the back of a
motherboard some motherboard
manufacturers are actually putting
components on the back of the board
behind the cpu socket that will serve to
effectively cool them lots of room for
cable man
get a shot on the front of the case and
then you'd be able to see over on the
other side that compared to the
competition in when seducing is a much
higher air flow solution fulfilling the
back of the board finally we've got one
of their mid tower cases which is not
maybe not quite as fully featured as the
Dragon Rider itself but you have to have
a complete product stack so you know if
you're not willing to shell out the
extra for the advanced features of the
dragon body to go something like this as
well they've also got a few more things
is just including a couple fans and
thank you for checking out the inland
booth here we are at the Seagate boots
so we've got oh yeah we puppies check
this out BAM best swag ever am i right
so we've got a wide variety of different
products they've got some of their
external products on demo including the
freeagent goflex which is available in a
variety of colors they've also got a few
other variants of gold flecks here
there's a slim one pro-one but the main
focus for seagate is the momentus xt so
momentus xt is on hybrid drive which
combines the benefits of mechanical
drive with the benefits of a solid-state
drive all within a 2.5 inch form factor
that you can easily install into your
notebook so if you want to learn more
about the momentus xt you can come and
talk to her so you get rep here at the
booth and I hope to see you guys in the
show welcome to the trendnet booth where
they are mostly showcasing their IP
camera solutions so these are security
cameras whether it's for home or
commercial use is totally up to you
they've got everything from your simple
wireless fixed cameras to your much more
advanced uber looking industrial cams
you got ones with pan
and until as well as yoshizumi optical
zoom you have motion sensing ones to
Eurasian start saving sensing we've also
got ones here you can see anything that
has the infrared lights around it that
is a day/night camera as well so there's
a huge variety of solutions but that's
not all trendnet is responsible for in
the networking world they do switches
routers kind of unique solutions like
little wireless extender doodads that
are great for hooking up your xbox to
your wireless network even though it
only has a wired connection and check
this up this is a free app called IP cam
viewer life Thank You IP cam viewer lite
so there's absolutely nothing
proprietary about the solution that
trend that is billowing that works with
their cameras so these are all cameras
that are running on this table right now
so thank you for checking out this video
about the trendnet booth at the intel
booth we find the best iowa which is the
finest machined into liver built to
bring to our show actually NCIX pc built
it but we couldn't do it without intel
technology so inside here we have a pre
overclocked 3770k processor because we
felt that even though the engineers had
intel did a fantastic job of the i7
3770k it needed to go even faster
unfortunately they built in that
capability for us so this has not only
the 3770
but it has also got an optional upgrade
to the gtx 690 from nvidia so this is
pretty much as powerful as it gets for a
gaming machine these days we've also got
it running on a 27 inch 1080p monitor in
3d vision mode just for the sake of
demonstrating to anyone who comes to the
show that Intel is pretty much the bee's
knees when it comes to gaming now also
in here you've got an intel SSD that's a
520 series that is the fastest say the
three consumer SSD on the market today
and it also comes with legendary Intel
reliability with a five year warranty
last but not least let's do a quick
brief of the specs of this bad boy so
it's cooled by a corsair h100 with 16
gigs of course there Brian when an asus
sabertooth board that's why I looks so
slick inside we've gotta see sonic and
50 watt 80 plus gold power supply and
for storage we've got a seagate 3
terabyte storage drives 32 gigs is a
cash
well 32 gigs of ram my bad i find that
the SSD because that's so much man it's
getting into like storage system
territory the lighting is done by
bitfenix alchemy lights and the case
itself has a custom carbon fiber vinyl
wrap that is actually automotive grade
and looks just fantastic in person last
but not least we caught the corsair 650d
case with easy to clean fan filter runs
and good looks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
