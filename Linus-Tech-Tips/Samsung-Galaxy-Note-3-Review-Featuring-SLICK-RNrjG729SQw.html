peripherals has the features you need to
win at a price you like click now to
learn more I'm no phone expert so this
is more just going to be an overview of
the note 3 and a comparison of my
experiences with the note 3 compared to
my Galaxy s3 I think this is fairly
applicable because I think a lot of
people that have s threes might be kind
of looking into new phones now not
necessarily upgrading yet but just kind
of looking at what's out there because
they've had their phone for a little
while the first thing you start noticing
when using a note 3 is the fact that it
has a 5.7 inch 1080p AMOLED display it
looks beautiful and it's huge this phone
when compared to size is about 6
hard-drives tall in the body and about
an SSD thick in the body as well and
that body houses some serious power with
3 gigs of ram 2.3 gigahertz quad-core
processor 32 or 64 gigabytes of memory
depending on what model you get Android
4.0 jelly bean a 3200 milliamp hour
battery a microSD slot which is actually
nice because a lot of phones nowadays
are coming without microSD slots because
of influence from say Google or other
sources a 13 megapixel camera which
happens to be able to take 4k video
although it doesn't have image
stabilization and it's a foam so it's
not exactly going to look as good as if
you took 4k video with a big
professional camera and USB 3.0 on the
bottom which back which is backwards
compatible to USB 2.0 but is quite handy
if you do happen to lose that USB 3.0
cable coming from an s3 when I heard the
rumors about a note 3 one of the
features I was most excited about was
the leather back and then I figured out
that it wasn't a leather back it was
definitely still a plastic back is a
plastic back that is made to look like
it feels like a leather back and it is
still definitely a plastic back it does
have a more grainy texture than an s3
smooth back has and it has that fake
threading although you don't really feel
it now as many of you are aware lately
Samsung has been kind of cheating on
benchmarks a little bit when it detects
a benchmark being run it will kind of
ramp up at CPU power and doesn't make a
realistic score so we won't be providing
benchmarks
you guys now what we'll be doing is just
talking about experience in games now I
haven't been a huge mobile gamer but
lately I've been jumping on the humble
Android bundles and I've been playing
quite a bit on my s3 when I moved to the
note 3 to test it out unfortunately I
don't get to keep it it was a massive
improvement the increased screen size
was amazing and I don't have any
problems with it because I do have
larger hands and have no problem
utilizing the phone in playing rate in
the increased screen size was just
perfect because that game is seems to be
more designed for a larger screen size
in general so having a larger phone made
a really big improvement and not only
that but the note 3 was much faster and
was very noticeably smoother than my s3
moving to balloons td5 I noticed way
later in the game when there's a lot of
balloons on the screen it made a big
difference being on the note 3 because
it was much smoother gameplay experience
and it was my s3 chopping quite a bit
and in both of these games and in
everything else I've actually checked
out the screen on the note 3 was much
more vibrant and looked a lot better
before the note 3 I've never had
extensive experience using a pen on a
phone before I started with the Nexus S
and then I moved to a Samsung s3 so the
main thing I noticed was air command it
was a nice really easy to use system
because right when you take your phone
out it's right there and if you don't
want to use it you press anywhere else
in the screen it just goes away and my
favourite feature within Air Command was
pen window I thought this was absolutely
fantastic because you just draw a square
or whatever kind of shape you want
wherever select what application you
want to be in that shape and it will
just work it'll be right there so the
main two things I noticed that it was
useful for was if I'm browsing the web
and I just kind of want to have a song
up or whatever I can open up YouTube and
a little square just very easily
manipulate it move it around shove it
out of the way make it small make it big
whatever I want and then it's it's I
find it easier than multitasking because
it's much more easy to manipulate now
the other thing that I found really nice
was say you're reading an email that
email has a whole bunch of different
numbers in it and you need to manipulate
it in some way so you'd need to add a
whole bunch of stuff up you can just pen
window a calculator on to your screen
make it as bigger as small as you want
and then that's a super easy and simple
way to do it there's a bunch of other
functionality in Air Command that might
be useful to you as well
but my favorite one was pen window next
up we have the camera and as quite a few
you know I'm not exactly the best camera
man so I had b-roll or Brandon take the
photos and
video for me what I noticed is that in
video and photo the note 3 definitely
has much more sharpening than the s3 now
if that's something you want or don't
want I'm not entirely sure and that's
more of a preference thing so you might
like that idea or dislike that idea but
that is definitely something I've
noticed I've noticed in other people's
test shots as well s voice left a little
bit to be desired especially when Google
now is sitting there on its own pedestal
it it was not nearly as responsive and
not nearly as helpful and didn't have
some of the features that I really like
one of my favorite things about Google
now is that it will respond to you when
you try to ask it a question so you can
do it basically hands-free and without
looking at it with s voice you can talk
to it but you still have to look at the
screen to figure out what's actually
going on which is not really that
intuitive in my opinion personally I
find the build quality on Samsung phones
never really to be quite as high as
other phones say like Nexus devices or
an HTC One but comparing to an s3 I did
find it to be a little bit better I like
the silver band around the outside I
like feeling that it seems a little bit
solid and it's better than the kind of
rounded curvature that there is on an s3
and I like the back seemed a lot more
solid it seemed a lot more clipped on I
found with an s3 it would just kind of
fly off this one I have to pry it off a
little bit and I do actually like that
well my screen was the favorite feature
the battery life on this thing was
monstrous and one of my biggest pet
peeves and phones is extremely short
battery life that I find on most of them
and this actually got away from that I
played a considerable amount of games on
it during the day and then had light to
medium usage on it throughout the day
and it still had a fair amount of charge
left at the end of the day so that if I
had forgotten to charge it overnight I
would have been able to use it at least
for the first bit of the next day which
is actually pretty impressive if you're
not scared of the very large form factor
and don't mind using it possibly with
two hands the note 3 is definitely a
phone to look for if you're looking to
upgrade in the comments below are you
looking for a phone that has very large
screen real estate and a really large
battery like a note 3 or are you looking
for something that fits into your hand
better and it's just more adaptable like
some other phone like say a nexus 5 and
like the video if you liked the video
dislike the video if you dislike the
video and as always please subscribe to
