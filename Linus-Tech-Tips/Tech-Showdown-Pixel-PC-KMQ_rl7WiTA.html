time is pixels that's it last time it
was future we all saw how that went so
hopefully it goes a little bit better
this time
I'm here with 7s and I'm here with
antvenom we've got some game as
streaming game youtubing guests to go
along with our well potentially very
game oriented theme but first
introducing the hardware so Corsair
provided their 600c case a nice clean
blank canvas for us to work with we've
also got h1 15i water coolers RM 1000 x
power supplies along with some Dominator
platinum memory to go with our Maximus 8
Xtreme assembly motherboard our msi gtx
980ti gaming graphics card our 6700 K
processor and last but not least our
cable mod cables and lighting so beyond
all that stuff I just listed the rest is
up to the imaginations of the two teens
and I wish the other one luck not
because I want to wish them luck because
they don't seem to fucking need it
because this is gonna be my third time
using if I go down again here I wish
myself and antvenom luck we got this I'm
confident let's go
Intel's skull canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more at the link in
the video description ok so now one
thing I'm a little bit concerned about
is this top panel doesn't seem to yeah
it seems to be like riveted mmm in a way
that I was not expecting it to be now
let's see what we're doing there I mean
I want the top here because all that
shit yeah it's like we're not doing the
original thing on that remember let me
look what look what set there like
that's not even required no you're good
oh yeah we're sort of hot panels your
problem okay the right panels your
problem yep that handles my problem and
the front of my bra I did I wind up with
like the two like showcase pieces is
great because hey man you wanted to be a
guest so you know I'm not saying I'm not
owning up to the challenge I'm going for
gold here well you said you wanted to
win so ragging you the I wanted to be
along with you let's move down that's
right that's right we're taking loose
down who's not
he cannot be undefeated yet again okay
so this is nice
this front canvas comes off for me like
really really beautifully which is gonna
give me a lot of a lot of room to work
here so I have to get started on this
right away because I'm relying on
multiple layers of paint to dry
fortunately it's extremely hot today
yeah okay let's take all the crap off
the news just oh here to get started on
this you know we need to do painting
really really quick I'm gonna lay
everything out though okay uh which is
the top that matters sorry which is the
top for this this is will be clip move
yeah this is the time okay oh yeah this
is hot
yeah should we have brown in the middle
so there should be a brown stripe in the
middle threads look up an image well
there is no top down I there is no top
down were a bad idea like um yeah the
path Brown and then we'll build it up on
the other end right okay so six of them
regardless of my planning for the for
the paint here I need to get this first
layer on like extremely quickly here so
I hope this tape works properly um okay
paint oh all right I need to paint all
of these yeah do all our all of them
like that Oh have you tried this okay
does it actually I don't actually know
if it matters now it has the arrow from
ham oh it's just it Wiggles on guru food
it just Wiggles a lot less it's hot oh
whoa it's pretty tight it's pretty tight
yeah right now I'm just sort of tracing
over this area right here and then I'm
going to like practice cutting this
material and then make sure I get to cut
really smooth cuz sharpness is like a
key thing here making sure that it all
looks really really good so I am working
on a multi-layered paint job that is
going to be the dog that will some duck
hunt and a duck so this is going to
require about six layers of paint which
means I need to get started painting it
for sky color immediately because I mean
it makes sense because our guest today
is sky does MINECRAFT right wow you went
there it liked it even though I know
it's gonna turn out really well it makes
me feel so useless isn't going along
because I feel like I could be doing so
much more at once I did not check the
drying time for this paint not that we
had a choice because the colors that we
needed were only all available in this
this trend clad less paint stuff but it
wants one to two hours to dry I'm going
to have to find a faster way to do that
okay so it's a hot day but where is the
hottest place you can think of on a hot
day inside of a black car or at least a
car that used to be black
this is the sky color for the front of
my face I'm going to be basically baking
this dawn on the inside of my car
the French air
now that will hurt its adhesion but I
only need this to last for a few hours
so step two if I actually need to take
my design and count pixels well okay
yeah that's fine I'm just gonna draw
myself a grid and you use this nice big
piece of paper here and I'm gonna take
one of those pencils that you ya hated
on so hard I'm just breaking down my
graphic here that I want to use in - how
many squares by how many squares I need
here I noticed speaking of squares that
they already managed to have something
painted before we started here so I'm
not really sure how that works this is
for the Mario Road up on top sure so
this thing which will play these things
that's not right is theoretically going
to go up here so that it can be accessed
from this area all of these are going to
be used literally I guess I could
probably leave with that to the theme
yeah and then we're going to use this
along with these which we will color to
make sense with this and these which
will create the thing that he's coming
out of and then that whole situation is
going to go up here and then this you
can maybe figure out from what he's
doing great pretty self-explanatory if
you know what's up yeah yeah and then
there's going to be some of this stuff
going on and then these guys are going
to explain everything I'm like how it
all works with like this thing and stuff
and yeah the other stuff you'll just
have to kind of come along see how it
goes
that might be the one just checking to
see which ones are the sharpest by
rubbing them against my bare fingers
because okay just cuts right now to make
sure that I know how this is all going
to break apart and like how it's going
to look so I think I might be okay but I
might do what I might do is cut a little
bit too big and then just sort of make
it and make the cuts thinner and thinner
until I can alright it's the fact that I
have these lines that cut on made this
like such a brilliant fine because the
scissors are just kind of like gliding
with it this is this is probably gonna
look super shy
yeah I need your uh a judgement call
over here for a minute okay okay to make
my life easy
I can work with centimeter sized pixels
yeah and that will make this graphic go
to about here okay so it'll be about
this big that's what that means I'll
have to cut off his head about here
sticking over the bottom
what do you mean so like it's going to
go from the chin up I'm gonna it'll mean
that I'll have to make a lot of
adjustments to go to the size of my
grille okay I mean if you think we got
to do it then we got to do it so though
I'm just actually you know you can do
zoo is there a way you can like zoom in
on that picture super far and then we
could like use a scroll wheel and like
actually see what it'll look like crops
with the duck I could see if that I mean
the whole hand so you think we need that
basically down to that that's what I'm
I'm thinking personally okay
so this is not the right size oh my god
there's there's a CPU sitting just put
the heck up all right
perfection we really care about getting
the tops of these and some of the sides
I'll sort of piece it together so that
the ones that I get the sides I will
also go on the sides of the build and
the ones that have the non painted sides
those will go on the interior and
hopefully math works in our favor and we
have enough with the half sides painted
oh yeah
okay we got ya
a little bit light on each side I might
end up making it a little bit taller
this while I'm cutting it okay and then
we'll surround it with blocks yeah yeah
there's no way to take this off and cut
it
oh so quail egg rattling if I screw up
the cut we're just like done oh man if
it's screwed up or if I screw up the top
of case like I I can't get another case
I'm a little worried about this one
all right good so first incision made
I'm actually really satisfied with that
result with my 1 centimeter by 1
centimeter grid that I need for the big
the big my big contribution to the
project so ant and I have divided up the
labor so each of us is taking on one
smaller project and one bigger project
so we're prioritizing the bigger ones
right now and then whoever has time left
over will actually build a PC I guess if
I forgot about that part yeah well you'd
be surprised how often that's happened
every single time
that's perfect
it's so good so good we actually should
do an install the install pretty soon
but all of our blocks are the same size
you know what that just adds to the
charm that goes there sounds like Linus
is doing a lot of the work over there I
thought this supposed to be a team
project this was like the best find Oh
am I gonna really free ball this one
free ball free hand this one hope I
didn't make this too big I don't know if
we have enough blocks really like I
thought we got it a lot but yeah the
magic doesn't happen so it's just sort
of making it look close to right at this
point that's about the best we can do I
think it's fine
people say Picasso was a great artist I
say check this out okay so I think I'm
good I ended up I cut off one pixel on
the wingtip here which I don't think
really affects the look and gives me one
pixel of margin on either side whoa
so now what I have to figure out is the
order in which I want to do the colors
so what I want to do is layer my tape
onto this template I think I really wish
I had used the shiny side which I would
feel more confident about removing this
from but I want to layer on my tape
cutting really really sharply in such a
way that I can remove layers as I want
to apply more paint wait no that won't
work
hold on I need to cover it more as I
want to apply more paint
wait okay so I just need to file it down
a little bit nice it's not like it
turned out really well so I'm stenciling
on the back obviously it's not showing
through at all wow that's great so just
file it down a little bit and it's going
to look sharp I mean it already does
look pretty sharp okay so I really
wanted to do this with tape but it does
not appear as though I'm going to have a
choice which might mean my lines will be
a little bit less clean but I think
that's a sacrifice I'm going to have to
make here so I'm gonna go see how dry it
is I'm going to do my dog and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to use the
exacto knife to cut out color by color
and then I'm going to use tape to fill
in the gaps as I do other colors part of
me was worried that this would like
bubble or some something like that and
I'd have a real problem on my hands
in fact that actually looks kind of
fantastic that paint is still tacky oh
that is a huge problem because I can
actually live with the other colors
being tacky because I'm going to cut
away my top layer as I go but this one
cannot be this paint I can tell you one
thing for sure this paint is going to be
wet when the judges are judged I've
never used one this big to do this job I
don't know if this will work yeah this
is too big but wood might work it might
work later
whoa it's all good okay all right so
right now like I made this second shape
I mean I haven't cut it so it's not
another time waste but I looked at that
and the way that this has to go on the
side panel and I'm like yeah maybe not
the smartest idea maybe I should get
something of the same width so I'm going
to do that I'm pretty worried we are
down to an hour and a half I have
basically not started painting yet the
good news is that the second panel is
relatively low forward so not a whole
lot to go wrong ah I could go on
all I'm hearing over there as time as a
problem so I don't I don't really feel
bad at all like I don't actually feel
like time is too much of a burden for me
right now I'm feeling good everything
about what we think we're doing takes
forever we are not doing well for time
thank you for asking
all right so yeah Linus is using the
exacto knife so like as you can see I
still have like a lot of cuts to make
here but I think I'm just gonna leave
this be for now and then work on this
material for the shape that's right
there and then will pretty much be good
to go and like looking at this we're
looking at this versus looking at that
like that's going to be way easier to
cut I'm not even gonna have to think for
that this is like the little pew pew
thing that's it's a square yay snap that
off that right there and bam final shape
so all I need to do is take the exacto
knife to this guy and we're done like
this entire side panel
you can have a look at what that looks
like does it look like pixel art like is
it perfect no does it look like pixel
art yes
so term 5 foot mod ok so I'm starting to
get deeply worried about drawing times
here this is still very tacky not to say
it doesn't look good I think it looks
great
it just feels very tacky so I'm a little
worried about how I am going to get my
stencil on top of it without completely
destroying the finish and I really don't
have a lot of time to wait anymore so
what I may have to do is build myself
some kind of scaffold or something that
gets it very close and that I may just
have to spray down as straight as I can
in order to get the lines as clean as I
can but you can see where he's going to
be yes
all right so we're we're done our cuts
that took a while but now I'm going to
move on to like assembling the computer
and just making sure that we have a
completed like machine pet we can
showcase off so this is either going to
be a moment of triumph or a moment of
despair hey Dad I can look at that
as you - Ino oh god why HD - evil
I've never gluten to me well before
that's gonna weird don't screw up
they might have done the power light and
money
so first things first I'm going to touch
up so the good news is I did all of this
in pencil so if I catch the light just
right I can see the lines that could
have been bad so I pick up the processor
and I have it in this hand and the heat
spreader just falls into my other hand
so this is all I got for like a way to
keep from spraying over the black that
I've already done this is okay so that's
2 out of 4 colors the next ones are
going to be the ones where it really
takes shape and I can probably do both
of them in one go here run these fans we
get these like different color rings so
just to try and like color match
everything not really too sure if like
this color this color will really work
at all so just to be safe we're going to
go with white and just kind of go for
saf as far as the fans are concerned so
that we don't have to worry about you
know getting any of the colors wrong
everything I do now can completely
destroy the project
okay
shut up and I just made a queue here my
god dude destroyed it as in a good way
like the bank's asshole no no like oh
dude I'm shaking
beautiful oh it's so beautiful
nail that's like the unrealistic yes I
know okay here's my glove we got love
for the love
Oh God
oh my god
I didn't like didn't expect what you're
doing at the bottom there that brought
it all together
well tell anyone but I was that tell you
because this is like my specialty in my
field I decided to create like actually
a little story around this rather than
just placing everything at random so
like as you can see like this this guy
right here he this guy right here has no
idea what's coming like everything
behind it it's like everything in from
is like nice and lovely everything
behind him is just like Danger Danger
Danger at lighting in there right yeah
um although you want sent us some kits
that are magnetic
I don't came unplugged came on before
the RGB came unplugged super metas I
have to make a video dude I know it's
actually working
yeah totally is plug-in to control this
there we go
okay post 99 okay
yo got it got it got it got it got it
whoa Jesus that's very bright good
enough not the most amazing looking
thing ever unfortunately tape go to work
better but I might just have to live
with that and by night I mean we will
definitely just have to live with that
oh okay I might have made a small error
to find small so let's say I'm upside
down
desperate times call for desperate
measures
yeah that's amazing you're gonna do do
the eight
there's the fans in the front start
spinning go just that thing aggravate
whoa I like it love it okay we're done
done hey piece gross huh I'll see you in
the judging room whoa okay so we got to
move ours over there how do you want me
to do this I want to stay where you're
at and then I walk it through the office
yeah sure yeah let's do that so cuz the
way it hangs down it's gonna I will it
close I don't know yeah I think it's
gonna be close
hold on I mean if you cut it open dude I
could like it but you know what I forgot
the bottom is inverted ATX ah
kaboom sucker done perfect okay I love
the build already they're trying to
butter us up by saying hey take a mint
so there's free mints in one of five
collectable tins you want the scoid boys
house no verse to the star one yeah we
couldn't find it that was gonna be they
didn't have the dollar store that was an
idea house they do really I want to do
it I don't know if these are real mint
or not well no this is cool this
playable though like holy crap okay I'm
see the case looks wicked oh you guys
have a screen that is a beautiful dog
and that's all this guy right here and
that's the system that's playing yes
it's not so there's Donkey Kong on the
side of the glass side of the case looks
very cool the aesthetic is dank all the
buttons of this controller this is very
nostalgic alright let's see what we got
going on here because I spent the past
45 seconds just like marveling and how
all the buttons on this are mapped
correctly
we've got like an O Maj 2 DK here like
with all the ladders and whatnot um
there's no looking at here there's like
a big Mario sock over the heatsink it's
kind of crude but it still looks pretty
cool there's a bunch of like Tetris
blocks in the bottom space invaders
machine so there's like a Mario
diorama on top it looks like they used a
couple of little shot cups to make pipes
which is pretty sweet oh and it has like
the flag and everything oh this this
little thing is official has Super Mario
Brothers 30th anniversary on it that's
pretty that's pretty sweet so I like
this this is cool but over here we've
got an official antvenom minecraft style
wait it's like Minecraft as well as hunt
but it's like a 8-bit con with the duck
hunt wasn't you know I know but like but
I guess it's like a Minecraft duck
what's the theme I don't know there's a
thing on top of the graph is called a
little orange guy do you know what this
do either of you guys know what that is
little orange guy I don't I don't
actually play
it's a creeper I don't play minecraft ok
so creeper for Minecraft yeah
Colton knows yeah okay that's pretty
it's actually pretty clean overall yeah
they did a pretty good no that's yes yes
plug Arn the controllers like come on
look yeah and push the power button ah
ah
okay well that's cool they put okay
Zelda emblem here too that's pretty
sweet I do like the setup here
the game is frozen though oh good you
get you good
okay Burkle's gonna keep playing um
super mario we're going to finish
looking at at the Minecraft / old-school
8-bit case here so we've got pong over
here so what's going on oh look at this
side so on this side on the mario case
we are we so they also they both want
the space invaders here that's
interesting so space invaders you have
one that goes from pac-man you have
actual pac-man who apparently is missing
an eye but that's okay okay I feel like
the NES build has a lot more going on
the entire lot more factors you have
like over there or all you really have
was the one what would you call it the
creeper the creeper you have a cure but
here you got like the like the ladders
of stuff from DK you've got the Mario
sock as basically a ram cover and we
don't know what's in that sock all right
so I'm gonna give the Mario themed PC
I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 overall
I liked it it has a little bit more to
kind of wow factor when you first
initially see it but with the theme
being pixels and stuff the more I looked
there's a lot going on
but I think some of it was a little bit
kind of shuttle a done the theming for
the most part is really really good all
the way through the DK ladders on the
front you've got the mario sock as a ram
cover um most of this build has been
touched in one way or other by the theme
which I really appreciate
so um in all I think that the NES build
no I do not forget is over benign uh
well I spent the whole time playing
video games on the nest build and it had
free mints and it looks cool I would say
it's almost a ten out of ten except is a
little bit dirty you know it's not very
clean but you know what a little a
little spit shine and polish this bad
boy could be a ten but it gets a nine
for me as written right here and I wrote
some of this his name on it all right so
the Minecraft being build for me gets an
eight out of ten
I just like it it's it's clean it looks
good
I think everything on all was pretty
well executed so well I looked around
the outside I thought the the paint job
especially for the duck hunt on the
front where it actually looks like the
duck is fleeing in terror very realistic
I think the diorama on top is slightly
more realistic than the nes bill because
there is a background but basically
nothing happened with the inside which
was a bit disappointing but a good score
I think is deserved for this so this one
gets an 8 for Linus nat venom well I'll
start off by saying I did really like
the paint job on the front I thought it
looked great and if Linus was involved
you know that's a great paint job for
lightness so I think he really put in
the effort and he worked hard and I know
it looks really cool I wish they had
almost carried through the like blue
paint job
case because that would have looked
really cool or like just like paint on
the other panels I would have been
awesome but it still looks good the one
of the pong side I thought was kind of
Shadle II painted I can't really
remember it wait Sharlee painted it
wasn't as good as a front but obviously
the front of the case what you're going
to see the most if it's like in a desk
or something um but yeah I thought it
was good it just didn't have the extra
little Flair that was on the other PC
build so therefore I gave it an 8 out of
10 which is still good that's like wow
