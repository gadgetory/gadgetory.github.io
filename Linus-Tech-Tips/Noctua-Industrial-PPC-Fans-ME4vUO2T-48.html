finally given us what we asked for
higher rpm and therefore higher
performance fans with the same
outstanding knock to a technology
warranty and build quality and in black
instead of poop brown and vomit tan a
global leader in tech recruiting is
celebrating geek pride by giving away
ten amazing tech prizes for more info
visit the modus Facebook page or modus
com
but a February as simple as wow they
released those fans Linus really likes
in a different color you wouldn't be
getting a full video about it you'd be
getting a tweet or something no these
black fans are part of not to us all new
industrial PPC or protected performance
cooling lineup they feature similar
designs to my favorite two models from
their traditional retail lineup but they
have some upgrades that allow them to
deliver even better performance and
longevity so first up the construction
material has been upgraded from
polybutylene terephthalate to some kind
of fiberglass reinforced polyamide this
allows the structural components of the
fan anyway to survive temperatures of up
to a hundred and forty degrees Celsius
as of any other part of a PC would still
be working at that point so maybe not
that interesting but what is interesting
about it is that not to a seize the
application for these fans in other
industries including automotive
Aeronautics and home appliances as well
so who knows maybe that will come in
handy next we get a supertastic
three-phase motor design that unlike
traditional fan motors provides nearly
continuous power to the blade assembly
rather than torquing it hard than
letting it rely on its own momentum to
get another push this improves
smoothness and reduces vibration and
power consumption at the same time next
we get IP 52 dust and water resistance
or ip67 dust and waterproofness
depending on which cue you go for with
the badass ip67 ones being obviously
more expensive this makes the new PPC
fans ideal for you somewhat not to us
describing as challenging conditions
although I mean chill
I guess being rained on is a condition
that I'd consider to be challenging for
a normal fan or maybe even more than
challenging ridiculous the last change
oh yeah more on that last bit later the
last change is the only one that I don't
much care for not to a has increase the
running speeds from 1500 rpm to 2,000 or
even 3000 rpm depending on the skew
compared to the standard operating speed
of 1500 rpm for the regular retail
models this means that with regular
low-speed adapters which by the way are
not included in the box but you can buy
them your own multi packs of them along
with Y cables extensions and
anti-vibration outs and all that stuff
that means that it's harder to reach a
speed that I find comfortable with just
one of those normal adapters thank
goodness for PWM control though I was
able to get these down to a level that I
found satisfying so thumbs up for that
and it does all of this while
maintaining the 150,000 our mean time
between failure and six-year warranty of
the regular fans now I mentioned that
these were my favourite fan models but I
didn't really mention why much fuss gets
made about airflow versus pressure
optimized fan designs and putting the
right fans in the right places but my
problem with that is that I might change
my configuration at some point so I'd
like to have whatever is most versatile
a pressure optimized design like the NFF
12 will perform quite well in an open
air situation and rock the house in a
restrictive situation like if it's up
against the heatsink radiator or
restrictive fan grill that's why I
prefer pressure optimized fans and I
prefer not to as over other ones because
they just plain old kick-ass I don't
even understand most of the technology
behind them but they're well built
perform like nobody's business
undervolt gracefully or at least lower
their speed gracefully and aside from
looking like rubbish for normal ones
anyway are the best fans on the market I
guess I should mention why I prefer the
814 it's because it has a square frame
so it's much better for raid
later mounting it a little bit again
more versatile and easier to find spots
for it but that's why these are so
exciting subjectively using them they're
obviously louder meant for industrial
environments but for all the other
benefits I will deal with the slight
inconvenience of needing to Rika jigger
my fan speed controller to reach my
target sub 1000 rpm running speeds and
frankly most people aren't the kinds of
quiet freaks that I am so y'all are
likely to even be bothered by this and
may even consider it to be a big
advantage that they are able to run at
higher rpms
now I said I'd elaborate on the water
and dust resistance so here we go I
grabbed one of the ip67 2000 rpm models
it Noctua shipped me and decided it was
time for it to go for a swim as a
control I grabbed an old NFP 12 and put
it in the same bucket I left my camera
running to see how long each of the fans
would survive under water now one thing
that was a little bit confusing at first
was the way that the older fan simply
spun slower due to the water resistance
while the industrial PPC fan would start
and stop to protect itself from damage
this submerged scenario is unlikely to
ever actually occur and if it did the
rest of whatever the fans attach to
would pretty much be dead anyway but the
good news is that it brought our
attention to a cool feature that'll be
great in the real world as well like if
a wire gets caught in a fan or something
like that your fan is more likely to
protect itself very cool anyway back to
the water long story short the water
resistant fan lived the other one didn't
our hypothesis that Noctua doesn't just
randomly make crap up when they're doing
their marketing materials has been
confirmed once again now you may have
noticed that I've been calling this fan
black all this time but it actually
still has brown accents and normally
this is the point where I'd be like yeah
whatever Brown fan masterrace anyway but
actually that's not going to happen
because I saved one more surprise for
you guys at the end here even the little
brown accent anti-vibration notes can be
taken off so you're left with a
completely clean looking black fan
ballin just be ready to pay through the
nose for these bad boys because they are
extremely
expensive as usual speaking of expensive
