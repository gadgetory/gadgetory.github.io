a file or especially if you format or
wipe an entire Drive whether it's a hard
drive or an SSD like this one that that
data is just gone but in actuality if
you were to properly delete every single
file that you deleted from your computer
it would bear a significant cost both in
terms of time because you would have to
actually take time out of your drives
busy schedule running your OS or your
games or whatever else to write ones or
zeros to that entire portion of the
drive and in terms of durability
especially with SSDs which only have a
finite number of times that they can be
written so the way this actually works
is either in the MBR or GPT which is the
GID partition table the entry for the
file gets deleted but the actual data
stays until it's incidentally
overwritten so what that means is if you
were ever going to recycle a computer
drive or if you were gonna give a
computer away to a friend you need to
make sure that all of your selfies and I
really do mean all of them have been
properly deleted from your machine and
that is where today's product comes in
this is the red key USB which allows you
to quickly and easily wipe any computer
and also will probably be showing you
guys a free way to do this because this
is sort of unnecessary but for you free
ish and this video is brought to you
guys by the Trident zeruel series of RGB
memory from g.skill this stuff features
a polished aluminum heat spreader and
this really cool crystalline structure
on the top that allows the RGB lighting
to come through in a way that is
absolutely flashy you can check it out
at the link in the video description
so let's start by taking a look at
what's in here so supposedly we should
just plug this in and it'll give us its
own little screen and it'll start wiping
so this is actually the original red key
USB there's this funny there I don't
know what to make of this guy so it's a
Kickstarter that did apparently deliver
to its backers really really small
campaign I think they only raised about
like eleven thousand dollars or
something like that and then the site is
now down in spite of the fact that the
only instructions I can find for how to
update and your red key includes
lifetime updates are going to their site
and downloading the latest updates
although they're working on an online
updater for the new one but then the
site doesn't work at all so I don't know
how their online up to you is gonna work
anyway they've got a new campaign that
actually ends in like 36 hours it just
took us this long to get to this I don't
know where I'm going with this let's
just screw it let's let's try it what is
this I guess just for packaging keep it
oh just to keep it in there yeah so the
blue key is nothing this is just a 16
gig key so actually you know what Jake
can use this one to make like our free
version well about that I was thinking
about using a tool called dban but I
found that that's only for hard drives
and then I was looking for a free SSD
alternative and it doesn't really seem
like there's a lot unless you just get
the tool from your SSDs manufacturer
like Coursera has the tools Samsung has
a tool Kingston has a tool but it's not
showing up and with those tools you can
secure erase and then there's also in
Windows if you just reset like you can
show them right now it'll give you the
option to securely reset the PC which we
assume is a similar similar kind of tool
so maybe we should try that out keep my
files to remove everything right yeah
let's do it well we got an extra drive
here so see remove files and clean the
drive this might take a few hours this
won't take long
you send it you're sending me real mixed
messages here Windows health god we're
just doing it I thought we were I guess
so we're doing it it's fine
we have an extra drive to try this well
now we have to let this run yeah
what's actually doing something now yeah
that's good okay so now while this one
continues to run I think we're probably
at like 10% or something I notice we're
gonna go ahead and we're gonna try our
red key on our second test bench so you
can see here we've got our pictures
including the ones we don't want anyone
to see and we're just gonna shut the
system down we're gonna pop this in here
why are they so hairy David cuz grown
men have hair okay Wow you know just
because you can grow a nice beard David
not everyone can do that voice crack
dammit do you remember what their key is
f2f 11 delete key VJs no I just I just
want the boot menu okay well it would
have been f8 then but I think I'm
already gonna go into Mouse all right so
I'm gonna go with non UEFI yeah I think
you restarted oh no
okay loading please wait okay here we go
oh god okay warning this device will
erase the contents of any disk detected
wipe will commence automatically after
60 seconds that's actually pretty handy
yeah you can't click f1 and start now
I'm gonna reset you mean I really should
we see the advanced menu yeah so if you
remember the keys or if you have the
manual nearby then look we don't have
much time you actually don't need the
GUI where is it do they actually not
just have all this in here we're running
out of time here close here it is check
that out main screen wiping screen you
may hear audio beeps during the last 10
seconds of the countdown timer if your
computer has a built-in speaker okay f6
advanced Boop will erase the contents of
any disk detected method random scramble
okay oh it's got like government
standards that's pretty common of
Defense
Reutimann
seven random pass method dang 33 random
pass method that's the like yeah data
zeroing let's to zero well random is the
default okay we'll do random eight
one round ah should we just go back and
then click start let's go back let's do
the default let's do the default f3 f3
cancel oh damn it okay I got you oh you
got it nevermind
so I guess we should wait so we can hear
the beeps hey and we're back we said
with ten seconds remaining oh really
do we want to wait the 35 seconds yeah
yeah I want to experience this I don't
think this has a speaker built-in yeah
it's not gonna do it there's a speaker
header right here okay I started okay
some queued discs it found our disc and
remaining time two and a half hours oh
cool it's a good thing we used a one
terabyte drive with this one good thing
we did one pass pretty cool three
o'clock okay it'd be done just before
the end of the day why don't we go do
the why don't we go do this smart your
garage door video then whoa so we're
back our data is wiped we can remove the
red key and power off the machine so we
need to put this SSD in a computer and
see if there's any data on it still yes
recup is it actually free the free
version is free all right what sort of
files are we trying to recover I mean
we're specifically looking for pictures
with much faster scan yes we could
search for do you want to search for all
yes which will take a long time yeah
this drive is is blank AF so we're
probably gonna have to set up make a
partition and stuff yeah yeah there we
go no files were found
would you like to scan again with deep
scan enabled note this can take over an
hour on a large drive will not that
large of a drive okay 23 files huh
Oh interesting this device just
irrecoverably destroys data so we should
not be able to find anything
and if that's just like the Boot Record
stuff yeah it seems likely cuz it's also
at the zero percent so we might Pacific
leave that should we check the windows
thing then ah yeah it's gonna take a
little longer to scan I reckon
well let's throw it on my computer oh
this might not actually be plugged in
monitoring up what is your problem you
know he does this professionally so our
first drive the one that we hit with the
red key that one's over there and we're
trying to see if we can find any
remnants of data on it then we grabbed
the other one that we used the windows
tool on and we're gonna go ahead and see
if I don't know we can find I mean I
guess specifically those pictures we're
just gonna deep scan it right off the
bat your photos or did you just do any
files any files any files we're gonna
get a lot of files okay so what come
back it's a thousand files yeah but we
know what they're called okay sure sure
Canaries folder looking for the nudes
folder all right seven hours later we
are finally done so this one actually
went quite quickly and it found a fair
number of things that were either
partially or fully overwritten but we're
still here with that said our photos are
not pretty much everything here is like
some kind of Windows junk like it's all
from the windows folder the for an
average person this seems fine but it
also assumes that your computer is still
functioning mm-hmm which is where the
red key comes in I'm gonna be honest
with you guys I was actually expecting
to kind of trash on this cuz I was like
what 45 bucks for a USB key like what do
you you know there's free utilities blah
blah blah and and and honestly there are
utilities out there but one of the ones
that we found that was somewhat feature
comparable was $10 and then you have to
provide your own USB Drive and this one
is like it's just dead simple to use so
here's our result from the one terabyte
drive we did actually managed to find
seven files what even are they
I don't know there's something so
something so something dot flvs and they
are apparently excellent status so like
we can go ahead try to recover one of
them but I can pretty much guarantee
this is garbage let's let's go ahead so
do we have anything that can read a
flash video cannot render the file how
big is the phone 600 makes apparently
apparently but also just be recognizing
random numbers as FLV I don't even think
I had any FLDS on that drive yeah no
this is broken I think this is just
garbage and that's only one that's only
one pass
so like bottom line then looks pretty
good to me if you have to do it a lot I
mean should we use it on James yeah
should we just like go around and wipe
everyone's computers I think that would
be quite the waste of money
whoever actually ends up with I think
our recommendation here yeah for like 45
bucks if you do more than just a little
bit of secure data erasing you might
have to buy a couple I mean yeah there's
gonna be command-line utilities that you
can use to do this sort of thing but
this is easy enough to use that pretty
much anyone could do it so looking
pretty good to me normally these sponsor
spots are pretty long but I'm gonna save
you guys some time private Internet
access
P ia VPN go get it now at the link in
the video description
it makes your internet browsing more
secure and it's super affordable go go
go go go go go
so thanks for watching guys if you
disliked this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking

really awkward because I think it's
gonna be like in between the Kickstarter
