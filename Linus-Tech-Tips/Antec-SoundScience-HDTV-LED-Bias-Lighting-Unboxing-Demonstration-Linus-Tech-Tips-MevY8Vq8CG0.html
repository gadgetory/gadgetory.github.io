been eagerly waiting for this is the
HGTV bias lighting from sound science by
Antec you can backlight your HDTV for
continuous comfortable viewing which
reduces eye fatigue increases viewing
hours that is three ways of saying the
same thing by the way enhances color
definition my understanding is this is
apparently actually true although I
haven't witnessed it firsthand and the
complements HD TVs up to 60 inches in
size so the sound science HDTV bias
lighting makes it easy to help figure
HDTV with professional backlighting
biased lighting adds a subtle white
backlight to your monitor or TV reducing
eye fatigue and increasing perceived
image clarity the color and brightness
of the leds are carefully calibrated to
achieve the optimal viewing experience
increase your HD TVs perceived contrast
ratio making blacks blacker and colors
more vibrant to learn more please go to
sound science audio comm step 1 remove
the adhesive backing step 2 my LED strip
2 back of HDTV step 3 plug into USB port
so you'll have to have some kind of a
handy powered USB port somewhere nearby
I mean for me this won't be a problem
but for you it might and all you got to
do is guess peel the 3m adhesive strip
put it on the TV so we are going to put
it behind our tech tip TV so hold on you
have to do it before and after so I'm
gonna sort of get us down to more like a
comfortable viewing brightness in the
room sort of you know we've got like our
epic fluorescent lighting in the Optus
here so I'm just gonna run over here
okay so that is what a TV looks like if
we didn't have BIOS bias lighting best
economist ed BIOS lighting which clearly
this is not you don't let your BIOS okay
I'm gonna install it and then we'll be
back home so besides our camera really
not cooperating very well with the sort
of lighting Fiasco that we're throwing
at it with a TV plus a light behind it
Plus no light in the room this is pretty
much what it looks like so slick and I
both agree that the effect of
finishing installing the bias lighting
is that there is now a light behind the
TV so there it is also with the bias
lighting you have the option of cutting
it to size so it's good for up to 60
inches which obviously wouldn't work
very well if there's only one size but
you can actually along any one of the
points where they have little scissor
lines yes they do have Caesar Month
that's good you can just cut it to make
sure that it's the right size for your
TV so it's a snap to install and if you
are looking for something that will put
light behind your TV then this product
will definitely do it don't forget to
