of the Acer b3 26 HK I was surprised to
see that I had responses right away from
folks telling me that they were already
sitting with a finger on the trigger
waiting for my review to let them know
if it was good or not and they were
planning to buy it however it happened
Acer has some hype around their 4k
monitors these days oh and by the way
for the gamers out there we've got an
AMD value 4k gaming rig build blog
coming up that investigates just how
hard it is to drive mainstream and
competitive games at this resolution so
don't miss that or this general use
review of what I think is the 4k monitor
that a lot of people have been waiting
for ensure swift victory with Corsairs
highly responsive lightweight gaming
mouse the Sabre RGB click now to learn
more 4k naan TN monitors like the PQ 321
cue from a soos have been available for
over a year now but that one even at
half of its introductory price is $1,500
and a 2 tile display to boot not the
most elegant solution especially for
gamers and UHD TN monitors while
available at great prices like $600 ish
and in some cases I've actually got
reviews of a few interesting ones here
here and here offering very competitive
performance for TN monitors are still TN
monitors so a lot of you have been
waiting for an IPS 4k monitor with the
improved text readability viewing angles
and color fidelity that comes with that
well here's a pretty darn impressive
looking option let's take a run at the
physical overview and specs of the b3 26
HK shall we the stand is actually
surprisingly solid considering it has an
8 kilo 32 inch panel sitting on top of
it and features swivel tilt and height
adjust but no pivot although that's
pretty uncommon on a monitor of this
size the base has a textured surface
finish that actually confused me until I
started absent-mindedly piling things on
it and I noticed that they didn't roll
off Touche sir and it also features a
sirs trademark paperclip magnet thing if
you don't like the stand though the
panels
vaisseau compatible mounting holes on
the back so you can use a third party
option or wall mount the sucker since
we're looking at the back we might as
well have a quick look at the IO aside
from a power input the uplink in two of
the ports for the built-in USB three hub
the other two are on the left side by
the way and a headphone pass-through I
would normally expect to see a
DisplayPort input and an HDMI input or
maybe two but instead I was pleasantly
surprised
you get HDMI with MHL full-size
DisplayPort mini DisplayPort great for
hooking up your laptop without any
adapters and why dual link DVI it only
supports running at up to 30 Hertz
without manual overrides at 4k but it's
a handy thing to have in a pinch for
older computers Acer could have knocked
my socks completely off with better
out-of-the-box support for waking from
sleep on a Mac and 60 Hertz Ultra HD
HDMI 2.0 but this is still a really
strong offering onto the panel itself
what a pleasure this thing is to use at
a pixel density of 137 PPI about 27%
more than a 27-inch 1440p monitor it is
amazing what a difference a nice high
contrast panel makes to the usability of
this product compared to other UHD
monitors that I've tried the extra four
diagonal inches is definitely helpful
most of what I've used is in the 27-inch
size range but I was still shocked to
find myself actually able to use this
beast without scaling quite comfortably
in Windows 7 and based on this new egg
review it looks like I'm not the only
one now my eyes are pretty good but
they're not perfect so it seems like the
nearly imperceptible IPS glow higher
contrast even when viewing at an angle
something that's bound to happen more
often than you'd think with the display
this large and flicker-free backlight
helps enormous Lee when reading we're
working on it it's not perfect though
mine did have a bit of a hot spot of
backlight bleed in the bottom right
corner although it's the kind of thing
that I only noticed because I went
looking for it so I could tell you guys
about it and there is a little bit of a
bluish color shift at more extreme
angles if you move horizontally again
though
something I noticed using the monitor
like a normal person speaking of using
the monitor like a normal person I do
have some thoughts on the truely not
very normal 32 inch monitor size in
general the last time I use something
this big as a daily driver was the Ben
QBL 3200 PT AV a 2560 by 1440 affair
that was a compelling offering at the
time if you felt like you wanted the
pixel density of a 24 inch 1080p monitor
but much much larger brandon uses it
every day for video editing and loves it
but that's not for me I don't find such
a large panel particularly comfortable
to use I mean you really need to move
your head to look from one corner to the
opposite one so for me the only way to
justify such a large screen would be if
I get more screen real estate to spread
things out something that can't be
achieved if you scale screen elements
within your applications or Windows
itself especially given how poorly all
of that stuff works so that is what
stood out to me about using the be 320
6hk the legitimate benefit of using it
more sharpness is nice and once in a
while I do catch myself sitting in front
of the 217 PPI 5k iMac retina that I've
been using lately marveling at how fine
the images but from a Productivity
perspective
nothing beats firing up an awesome
window management app like Display
fusion or aquasnap and spreading out
your work over an immense area so you
can see more at once something this
panel is the first to allow me to do at
4k I really really like this monitor but
it could still improve the on screen
display isn't great to navigate and
while it offers sixaxis color
adjustments for the custom picture
profile srgb mode for designers who want
accuracy above all else and reasonably
robust picture in picture and picture by
picture functionality it's a little
tedious to manually select an input
instead of just waiting for the auto
detect to cycle through them and there's
no control over pixel overdrive
something that many gamers like to be
able to adjust the good news is that
compared to other IPS monitors that I've
used in the past the default setting for
the be 326 hk4 pixel overdrive is
actually
really solid with almost no visible
overdrive artifacts and very minimal
motion blur or ghost trails behind
moving objects it's still a 60 Hertz
display though and going from the 144
Hertz rog swift that i've been using on
my gaming rig was a bit of a kick in the
teeth
but after grounding myself by throwing
an older 60 Hertz monitor on my desk for
a more fair comparison i'm perfectly
happy with the responsiveness all the be
326 HK for gaming even though I couldn't
find my stupidly Oh Bodnar thing to
actually measure it which leaves us with
just the conclusion should you buy this
monitor I still have the same personal
feelings that I've had for a while now
about 21 by nine monitors and I'm not
going to rehash all of that here but for
me the answer is not quite but not
everyone has any desire for an
ultra-wide and if you want Ultra HD for
more seamless support in applications
and gains pixel-perfect playback of UHD
video content or any of the other
numerous reasons that you might prefer
it this monitor is a great choice unless
you're a gamer
maybe we'll hold the phone - I thought
you said that it's gaming performance
was perfectly happiness inducing or
something along those lines
I did and it is so I need to give kudos
to Acer for making one seriously kick
butt display at a great price but gamers
need to see what's around the corner
what's going to be announced with free
sync orgy sync support in the coming
weeks before they can make a properly
educated decision on whether or not this
is the UHD monitor of choice even if
right now it actually kind of looks that
way speaking of looking that way today's
episode sponsor Japanese accessory maker
and mash is going to make your iPhone 6
or 6 plus look that way or well that way
or that way or any of the 9 different
ways depending on which color you like
and meshes mesh cases designed
manufactured and packaged in Japan and
made from a strong not too soft not too
hard elastomeric material the same kind
of stuff that you might find on the grip
of a tool it's available on Amazon in
the US Canada UK France and Germany and
they're looking to expand their reach to
even more countries as soon as they can
the case is available in nine different
colors that is
black yellow orange white blue turquoise
pink red and clear and I know my
pointing didn't correspond to the colors
I was saying but don't worry too much
about that and can be attached or
removed as easily as really any other
iPhone case so head over the link in the
video description to check out and mesh
