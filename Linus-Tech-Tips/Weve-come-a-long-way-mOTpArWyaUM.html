but yep that's me ten years ago videos
like this we're filmed on a Sony
Handycam that actually belonged to my
boss at NCI X's son so we're using the
cameras onboard audio an entry-level
photography light that we borrowed and
instead of taking screen capture
we just we zoomed in on the screen and
yes that is that is actually electrical
tape stuck to the front of the screen
nowadays we put a lot more technology
talent and time into our videos and I
like to think that it really shows so
thanks to being H photo for sponsoring
this video
we're will be doing a 10-year challenge
not with facebook profile pics but
rather with the production quality in
our videos that continues to change as
our channel ages and I have got to admit
I actually got really nostalgic going
through all this stuff and I'm not the
only one Brandon can I get a holla
that's not a holla B&amp;amp;H photo is the
largest non chain electronics retailer
in the US
serving amateur and professional
photographers and videographers since
1973 with fair pricing and a fantastic
shopping experience both online and
in-store B&amp;amp;H has been our go-to gear
store for over six years now check them
out at the link in the video description
or learn more about our experiences with
B&amp;amp;H at the end of the video the early
days were pretty rough like put this one
where we accidentally filmed an entire
video without audio and then instead of
reshooting it because I didn't have time
I just dubbed the voice-over at my desk
wow what is that
that's the transmitter the infrared
transmitter then there's this video that
has audio but with unbearable background
noise because the camera and its
on-board microphone was so close to the
computer hardware we were trying to film
so there's a few buttons down at the
the board you've got your OC Genie it's
so funny for me to hear people hearken
back to the good old days when Linus
tech tips was better back when he was at
NCI X I mean can you guys even imagine
if I uploaded this video today why does
he Vaughn get a probably cut off at the
end of the clip that's the actual end of
the video like we didn't edit that just
now and sadly the quality of Linus tech
tips basically didn't change for a solid
year
LT T's first real hardware purchase was
a canon powershot sx1 is which was
decidedly consumer-grade but definitely
an upgrade over the original sony camera
because that one recorded to tape so to
ingest our footage we actually had to
connect the camera to a PC over firewire
or actually a Mac to be more specific
and then capture the footage off of it
so yes my friends that thing was from
the era when faster than real-time
footage capture was a feature what a
pain-in-the-butt the SX 1 is actually
recorded 1080p 30fps video fully
digitally 2 SD cards and had a pretty
wicked optical zoom but there were
actually some ways that it was worse it
didn't support any form of external
audio so we couldn't even use that
stupid gray Twinkie microphone mind you
at that point
the goal was not great production values
online as tech tips which was supposed
to be our vlog channel anyway because
remember when I worked at NCIX we were
actually working on to video series
concurrently NCIX tech tips was believe
it or not the higher production value
one with editing some graphics and a
little bit of preparation on my part the
problem was that we couldn't make those
videos fast enough to meet the demand
from all of our partners so as a
compromise and it was actually my boss's
idea even though it ended up biting him
in the butt when I ended up splitting
later we created Linus tech tips which
was still owned by NCIX at that time and
the videos still went on the NCIX
website but the company name was no
longer in the title of the channel so
the idea was to give me a
bit more leeway to be edgier and not
worry as much about quality which
quickly turned into what I called the
one take policy where we would just keep
recording through stumbles with the goal
of shooting as many as six to eight
videos in a single session that would
last just one to two hours you know what
I like I like things that are called
special edition you can see there's some
more black stickers these are to prevent
people from taking it apart never take
apart a hard drive thank you for
checking out my blog on the WD black and
that was really how things were for a
long while
that is until we upgraded to a well okay
looking back it's kind of cute to me
that I was so excited about this but to
a Canon x8n that I pre-ordered thanks to
our increased NCIX tech tips budget back
in 2011 actually you know what no in
fairness this was a big upgrade because
even though it was a fixed lens camera
so barely even above a consumer
camcorder unlike the old Sony one which
used a proprietary interface for
external audio sources really limiting
our upgrade options the x8n had XLR
which meant that we could finally use
professional external mics like the
Sennheiser II W 110 g3 later that year
we would make our first hire Luke who by
the way grossly misrepresented his
experience in both camera operation and
video editing yeah you heard me Luke
start with welcome for our guest
camera operator who is also interviewing
for the tech tips assistant job and we
also reached a hundred thousand
subscribers this was after three years
of videos that quite honestly like I
can't even bear to go back and watch now
like those of you who have been with us
since then you guys are hardcore like
just amazing that stuff sucked a year
after that in October 2012 we finally
got our first piece of real professional
caliber gear at $8,000 the sony fs7
hundred would be our companies which
hadn't officially started yet most
expensive equipment purchased for years
to come
by the end of 2012 we had moved into the
era of Lynas media group being a thing
and - using his garage as a studio which
actually worked great because we could
open the garage door to give us some
natural light because we still didn't
have enough lights and we rented the
whole thing into a state that I mean we
thought looked kind of cool and techy
including the original tech wiki set
which believe it or not was not an
actual green-screen but rather real
white walls that were supposed to look
kind of like I was inside one of those
infinite white Apple commercials but
actually looked more like I was standing
in front of an ugly piece of drywall
overall though even in spite of some
stumbles this was when our videos began
to look like not complete sports garbage
for the first time we had two Kino Flo
diva lights plus whatever cheapies we
could borrow from NCIX when we weren't
back there doing contract work we had a
lav mic of our own and we had our fs700
still shooting at 1080p equipped with a
new shoulder stock and a counterweight
that seemed like a great idea for
balancing the rig but in reality was
just brutally heavy to carry around
anytime we'd actually need it like our
first year at CES where we made over 50
videos with just three full-time
employees speaking of employees this is
actually the first video that our fourth
employee brandon ever shot look at that
it's like the guy was destined for
greatness isn't it you got some nice
bokeh in the background there and
everything I mean not that we paid for
the privilege even though we had a
decent camera by this point it would be
over a year before we bought any extra
lenses for it I actually never told Edie
or Brandon to bring their personal
lenses to work but like they refused to
use the KITT one and I refused to buy
anymore
so everyone's a winner right anyway when
we finally bought a couple of Sigma
lenses we didn't really get a quality
boost because they were the same ones
that we had already been borrowing for
some time now around the time that
Brandon showed up coincidence
we also released our first video with
dedicated b-roll footage and it's
actually frankly kind of amazing that we
continued with the concept considering
how bad these shots are a nine site I
mean I thought at that time then it was
just a waste of time I was like well
come on you already have the hosts there
you've already got the camera there
you've already got the product if you
want to see it closer just move your
butt over closer to the thing and then
just like step back when I'm ready to
address the camera like what do you need
to come back later for but we did and it
was around this time that we also made
our first PC build guide ever on Linus
tech tips this was actually a supposed
to be a statement piece for us it was
the first time that we were gonna try to
meet or even exceed the production
values of the NCIX tech tips that we had
left behind with my old employer and we
spent a lot of time on the intro the
graphics the lighting setup and we even
tried to get like as much depth to the
shot as possible by pulling the table
out from the shelves behind me and then
positioning Brandon literally cheeks to
the wall at the other end of the garage
one of the most amazing things about
this video to me which ended up doing
50,000 views in the first day which was
like a huge deal for us at that time is
that I was still doing all of these
videos unscripted with at most bullet
point notes open on a nearby laptop or
scrawled on a nearby piece of paper that
changed when we switched sets yet again
to the infamous Langley House and
Brandon won another battle with me this
is where the teleprompter makes its
first appearance allowing me to read my
notes while looking directly into the
lens that is at least once we started
shooting our a roll on a tripod because
Brandon refused to try to hold the
camera with the teleprompter hanging off
the front of it what a lightweight
oddly enough the kitchen set that we
moved over to shortly after that became
so beloved by our fans that even though
we were only actually in the Langley
house for just over a year here we are
today years into our current studio and
we
we'll have people kind of harkening back
to the good old days in the kitchen
anyway by this point our budget started
to increase so we invested more in
lighting we bought a cheap piece of
green screen cloth that was so thin we
had to fold it three times over to
prevent light leakage from the window
behind even with the blinds closed and
we got our first slider that we used to
get shots like this one this is also
around the time that we made our first
purpose-made thumbnail image instead of
just using a still from the video and
also when we made a pretty significant
shift into actually writing full scripts
word for word or nearly instead of just
doing vlogs so you guys see that eye
contact on making with the camera there
that's because the video is scripted
ultimately we made this move as part of
a change in direction towards reviews
rather than unboxings and as a way to
both improve the information density of
our videos and to leverage our larger
production team without causing
inefficiencies so it was more work for
me up front to create the scripts but it
made the shoots much easier and less
time-consuming because retakes were
simple and editing was also faster
because there was just less garbage
footage for at that time Tarun to sift
through in September of 2014 we
celebrated 1 million subscribers with
our seven member production team and
over the following year we built out our
kit with fancier things like diffusers
which are especially important when
you're using a jib which was another new
toy that we use for top-down shots like
these in 2015 we moved finally to the
studio that we're in now in retrospect
that seems like so few people to occupy
this big of a space we continued to
build on our kit with all sorts of
random stuff closing out the year with
our purchase of two sony a7s twos which
became our b-roll and running gun show
coverage cameras pushing our pork N and
XA cameras to purely channel Superfund
duty our IP in 2016 we bought our first
big kid lights our to re sky panels
which are super bright
not to mention RGB something our channel
was definitely severely lacking and then
we kicked off 27
by getting a bunch of new gear to make
our lives easier at shows like CES
including our much more reliable Elektra
Sonic's wireless mic packs a variety of
pods of various sorts and a couple of
knockoff easy rigs which we only just
replaced like last week with the real
deal because they're like $5,000 each
honestly though worth every penny
because these things have changed our
lives and they allowed us to finally
achieve my goal of handheld filming with
a teleprompter
anyway shortly after we got back from
CES our new cameras arrived from red
which while painful for the bank account
and actually for our workflows at the
time cuz like 8k footage there was
definitely a workstation upgrade in
there somewhere they also gave us kind
of a sense of relief because at that
point we had reached the top there was
nowhere else to go with our gear I mean
people shoot Hollywood movies on these
things and yeah who did I think I was
kidding
Brandon always wants more stuff so last
year after we changed over our set from
something more SETI to something that I
think feels quite a bit more natural we
picked up a DJI Ronin 2 gimbal which
allows us to take smooth walking shots
like this one and then right before CES
2019 we bought a handful of Canon c2
hundreds to replace our poor a7 s 2s
that are both in various states of
disrepair and all of these things aside
from the fact that we're just geeks and
we love new toys to play with are
essentially being purchased for the sole
purpose of you guys being able to see
and hear me in greater and greater
definition something that over the past
10 years has surely become less
appealing which I guess brings us
perfectly into how B and H figures into
all of this the vast majority of those
purchases have actually been through B
and H going all the way back to our
original fs700 and even though I've only
been to their New York store once on a
day that it happened to be closed boy
they've been very good to us over the
years with fair pricing great customer
service we've actually had to return a
fear a few things for assortment of
reasons excellent delivery time
especially after their Canadian shipping
got more competitive a few years back
and generally great selections so it is
no BS for me to say that it was pretty
cool to have them reach out to sponsor
this video because to me that's yet
another indication of just how far we've
come
going from it's just even six years ago
not being able to get an appointment at
a trade show to be shown around
someone's booth to being taken seriously
by the real players in the production
space so thanks to being H for
sponsoring this video and thanks to you
guys for watching if you disliked it
well you know what to do but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff we featured at the link in the
video description
