brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steel series alright guys we're here
at the Indy mega booth checking out
crypt of the necrodancer which the name
sounds crazy and the game is crazy can
you tell me more about the main premise
of this game yeah sure it's a roguelike
rhythm game so it combines dungeon
crawling with moving to the beat and
attacking to the beat so you crawl
around a dungeon and you attack dragons
and a lot of undead monsters because the
necrodancer so yeah that's the general
premise of it yeah so basically the
whole the moving to the beat thing
there's a song playing in the background
you can load your own mp3s correct so
you can load your own mp3 so if there's
a song you like a certain dance song you
like you can load that up and then at
the bottom of the screen you see bars
coming into a heart and you have to move
on the rhythm of the song so you can
load in whatever you want and dance to
that tell me more about the main
mechanics I know there's a shovel and a
weapon how does that play into the game
so you move around with only the arrow
keys or if you playing with the ddr pad
with your feet and you move around with
just those and if there is an enemy like
any attack range of your weapon and
you'll attack instead or if you run into
a wall you'll dig it out instead so it's
all like context base mechanics cool
there's also hidden shops in the game of
stuff that you can find and to purchase
things you have to dance on top of them
which is actually pretty awesome that
what's your favorite part of this game
man right yeah well it's a roguelike so
it is randomly generated dungeons and so
every time you play it's different when
you die you start all the way over it's
just like it has a lot of replayability
is really refreshing as a developer it's
super fun for me because I don't get
bored of it yeah not getting bored of
the game as a developer is kind of a big
deal so I don't blame you for that being
a favorite part of the game at all um
this is a really interesting game you
guys won an award I've heard Editors
Choice best of show that's actually
pretty epic yeah yeah so that's actually
pretty epic award to win so even just
seeing that you guys should definitely
check this game out crypt of the
necrodancer if you want it how can you
