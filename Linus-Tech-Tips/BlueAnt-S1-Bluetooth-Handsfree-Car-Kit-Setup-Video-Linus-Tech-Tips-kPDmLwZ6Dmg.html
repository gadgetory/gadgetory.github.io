hands-free car kit and I thought it'd be
appropriate to do a quick guide on how
to pair it to your phone especially
because so many people are going to be
needing to do this over the next little
while so step number one is making sure
that bluetooth is enabled on your phone
so you go into your bluetooth menu
wherever it may be
select enable and on otherwise you will
not be able to pair it to the blue ant
s1 next step is to turn on pairing mode
on the blue ant s1 so you hold the
on/off switch for about five seconds
until you see the light start to flash
red and blue that means it's in pairing
mode so you can go into your phone and
go to trusted devices add new and search
obviously it's going to vary a little
bit depending on which phone you're
using but it should be basically the
same procedure regardless so it is
searching searching searching and I've
tested this off-camera so better find it
there we go so we click Add to list it
finds the blue ant s1 Add to list enter
the numeric pin the numeric pin by
default is 0 0 0 0 and then we press ok
it is now pairing to the blue mantis one
awesome so it is now officially paired
we can set a custom name so if you have
a couple different cars and they're each
going to have an S one in them and you
can set them to the two different cars
for example so that you know which is
which you press done and then you can
press connect and it will connect to the
blue ant S one so should you desire to
make a phone call for example at this
time then you could call someone and
let's let's see if Esther picks up so I
am now using the blue mantis one as I
would be in my car in theory so it clips
on to the Sun Visor and I must leave no
idea she's going to pick up or not but
yeah anyway ok you can hear the sound
coming out of the speaker it is
officially working correctly
thank you for checking out my setup
guide for the blue ant s1
okay she didn't pick up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
