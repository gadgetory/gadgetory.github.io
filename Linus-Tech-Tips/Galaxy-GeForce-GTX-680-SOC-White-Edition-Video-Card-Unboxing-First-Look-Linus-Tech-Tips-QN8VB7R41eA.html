custom gtx680 s and locations and
influence because there's just plain not
nearly enough of them but we are finally
seeing some custom gtx680 so custom
means custom pcbs custom coolers
non-reference design cards so this is
the galaxy geforce gtx 680 s OC so SOC
stands for presumably super overclocked
okay comes with a three-year warranty
two gigs of memory custom cooling a
force air bracket and it has a pretty
cool custom PCB but I'm not going to
give that away until we get in a little
bit further so have a look what they
have to say for themselves maximize your
performance with GPU boost so that is
the gtx 680 s ability to dynamically
adjust as clock according to the
available power thresholds okay enjoy
smoother gameplay with adaptive vertical
sync which either turns on vsync returns
it off to give you an FPS boost when
you're below the refresh rate of your
monitor and smoother gameplay when
you're above the refresh rate of your
monitor in terms of your FPS richer
visual so you can surround yourself with
multi monitor gaming on a single card so
Nvidia has added that to their
repertoire against the red team which
have had been a bit while they were the
only ones doing it for the longest time
I've even gotten like old 5870 I 1086
edition in that system that could do six
displays off a single card which was
totally not that useful for gaming
because it didn't have nearly the power
to drive it take control too extreme
tuner plus so that is there overclocking
software very very cool alright do more
of multi-display that was here ok
windows demands a real GPU this much is
true although I can't say it demands a
680 I think it'll be a while before
Windows demands a 680 I'll to the home
theater with 1080p blu-ray and HD CP
support game you need a galaxy graphics
card ok galaxy turn it all on ok well
let's go ahead and look at the card
because I think when you guys see the
card you are going to get pretty excited
about this so this
gtx 680 is the cream of the cream for
NVIDIA attention customers thank you
thank you thank you for buying it and
don't forget to register your card it is
their highest performing single GPU card
probably their highest ball okay their
highest performing single GPU card and
it is really really really really really
fast all the latest features all that
good stuff hdmi to DVI adapter mini what
mini hdmi to hdmi adapter okay to
dueling lacks 268 pin power connectors
okay I haven't actually like looked at
this hard that closely other than like
what I think is cool about it so okay be
sure to visit blah blah blah to get the
latest extreme tuner this is great okay
here's a disk but be sure to visit the
website download the latest Thank You
galaxy you have done it correctly sirs
and madams because that is exactly how
we roll here on tech tip here's the CD
download the latest oh yeah look at that
custom white PCB which would go really
well with a black and white cream system
or in just any system I needed a picture
of this on my on my Twitter account of
the Russian showing off one of these
galaxies super overclocked cards in a
vestige e2 system it looked absolutely
ballin out with the green lighting
effects on the back of the card that
looks so good
just admiring it I wonder what this
means says Hall of Fame on the back of
the card I mean I can understand this
being a Hall of Fame I mean just look at
it but I don't know why they had to
label it as such okay so on the back of
the card we can see very clearly this is
a custom PCB it is very very very custom
it is much longer than the standard gtx
680 PCB it also has dual six pit are
eight pin power connectors so it is
designed presumably with beefier vrm and
you can even see that there's a lot more
built onto the card then the stock card
it also has a much more substantial
cooler so this is triple 92 millimeter
cooling fans on an impressive I mean
this thing is really heavy this is a
heavy card on an impressive copper with
five heat pipes and then aluminum fin
array that goes the entire length of the
card and then some so you can see here
where all the heat pipes are running to
this is uh oh okay so this is a this
plastic or than it as a plastic shroud
but here we go so the GPU is right about
there right in between these two fans
these fans are covering almost the
entire surface area of the card as well
blowing down not only on the GPU in the
memory itself but also on the other
components oh the memories covered in a
heat spreader you can see where these
heat pipes are heading off to so a
couple of them go pretty close and then
the farthest out one carries heat over
here the next farthest that one carries
heat here and the farthest out one on
this side carries heat right to the end
there so if we look at the positioning
of the heat pipes and the fans each fan
is blowing down directly onto fins that
are right near heat pipes so we should
have hate being directly delivered it's
too bad they weren't able to put in one
more heat pipe right here but I guess
you can't really ask for too much in
terms of outputs oh this is interesting
okay so we've got DisplayPort and three
mini HDMI that is a very strange output
configuration I wonder why they did that
um huh okay well I guess I'd probably
opt for a display for it out of the
three just because mini HDMI is not not
the best thing in the world for
outputting at 120 hertz at 1080
p for 3d so hold on just a minute guys
well galaxy does whatever they pleased
when it comes to outputs it turns out I
mean they're MDT cards from the last
generation we're a great example of that
where they were like oh and vidya says
we can only do two displays at a time
well we can do three haha so there you
go they've gone with displayport and
three mini HDMI connections you've also
got an open sort of second pci bracket
so what that means is this is very much
an internal air flow card so you're
going to exhaust a little bit on the
back of the case but you better make
sure you have a case with good airflow
which I hope if you're buying a gtx 680
you've already had sort of figured out
now I've know is the fact that ok you
have two things of note is the fact that
you see how easy it is to access the
screws that hold these fans on can you
see that that's really cool take out
three screws pop the fan off you can
easily clean out your graphics card get
all the dust out of it completely having
removed the fans from it and I think
that's a very cool feature and the
second thing of note other than the fact
that it has pci express 3.0 and to sli
fingers for up to three or four way
configurations is the fact that this has
the widest PCB that i have yet seen i
have seen products with white PCBs in
the past such as sapphires pure
motherboard back on the 690 g chipset
for Andy this is much whiter this is
like white white as opposed to like
yellow white so an example of a build
that this would look absolutely
fantastic in is one like this where the
inner guts are predominantly black and
white so I would love to replace the
Radeon graphics card in here with a
suitably white geforce graphics card so
check this out see white and black theme
you go ahead you throw one of these in
there how beast would that look would
barely even fit to even though this is
an ark meaty this is a long graphics
card you know what I think I have a tape
measure here yeah let's measure how long
it is because this must be close to the
12 inches all right so from the back of
the there so 11 and a half
inches so make sure you have a case that
is capable of housing an 11 and a half
inch graphics card before you go ahead
and install on these so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the galaxy geforce gtx 680 SOC don't
