history have a massive trail of
controversy follow them but this one has
been one hell of a doozy with IGN
flipping back and forth between loving
it and hating it and the rest of the
internet that not being entirely
positive it's been one hell of a ride
the beta is here now so how does it
stack up well this is the wrong channel
for a review but stay tuned to see how
it performs and stay subscribed if
you're interested in more of these game
benchmarking videos this holiday season
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check the link in the
video description to learn more the
surprisingly smooth experience of
playing battlefield was nice I must say
I was half-expecting 60 or even worse
30fps frame cap but it never came
battlefront was actually running very
well the whole time I felt like I'd been
transported to another world or
something and this is why we decided to
benchmark the game despite it being in
beta so yes as I just said the game is
in beta but the release date is coming
up very soon November 16th to be exact
and due to its performance being singly
pretty well tuned I kind of thought that
we could give you guys some insight into
the potential performance of this game
so without further ado this is how I
benchmarked it this benchmark will be
conducted on survival Tatooine the
reason for this is that this is a
predominantly multiplayer game but
multiplayer games are very rough too
benchmarks we want to do a single-player
segment that being said this
single-player segment isn't that amazing
or consistent skip this cutscene by the
way but it's better than multiplayer I
do recommend running it about three
times just to get a good score though
wait for Admiral Ackbar to finish
talking and kind of line yourself up
with this particular pathway that should
be basically right in front of you
once Admiral Ackbar is done talking
you'll see the kind of pie circle thing
at the top right when that's finished
right when wave 1 begins start your
benchmark and start running forward
you'll see in the top kind of middle to
the left area there's a timer that
should actually perfectly line up with
your benchmark so when that hits two
minutes your benchmark should and follow
this pathway up into the right down
there where I was looking they might
spawn from there they might also spawn
from up here they happen to spawn behind
me this time if they're not directly in
your shooting path do not shoot at them
so don't turn around to kill them just
follow this path up into the right and
then curve around the corner to the
right again up into the left sorry and
then cover around the corner to the
right one thing that I'm going to take
time to talk about during this segment
is that the game looks actually kind of
really good I like the amount of debris
that's around that's one thing that I
appreciate it a lot the rocks that are
everywhere you'll see as we're walking
up here at the rock kind of fall
down and looks actually pretty realistic
it makes it feel like a more full
environment and I actually like that a
lot take the right side up here when you
get up to this corner they might start
shooting at you they might not depends
on where they are but don't shoot at
them pretty much no matter where they
are this ramp don't go down the ramp go
on the right side but then kind of run
off the ledge directly in front of you
land on the half ledge and then fall all
the way down run to the end of this
elevated path go on the right side of
the rock structure and then as you're
going on the right side turn to the left
and fall off the side run up the ramp
here again this is the same ramp that
we're running up near the beginning but
now they're going to be in front of you
if you didn't kill them at the beginning
and you're gonna want to kill them here
if you do clear the whole wave wave two
will spawn but that is okay if you don't
clear the whole wave like there I left
one enemy left alive
they won't spawn and you're totally fine
go along the same path that you went
along before and then you're basically
just gonna run this until the benchmark
ends so as you can see in the top
left-hand corner I've got about 15
seconds left and that should mean that
the benchmark will probably end right on
the corner up here now for graphics
cards our NVIDIA product stack is pretty
self-explanatory but the AMD lineup
seems a little long Co our Fury is out
for replacement if you check out this
graphic from kit GRU we do have a pretty
good representation of their product
stack but not perfect kind of close but
oh well for bond era we have a 260 X
which will actually perform slightly
better than the 360 for Pitcairn we
unfortunately don't have a proper
replacement because we don't have a 265
but we just kind of slotted our 270 in
there for good measure our 285 is a
fairly strong representation of the
Tonga category but its main drawback is
the two gigs of VRAM versus four and
then for Hawaii we have both the old but
crazy value r9 290 and the fancy new 390
X and then to cap things off as best as
we could we have the tiny little Fury
nano so yeah admittedly not perfect but
hopefully an okay representation of what
the Red Team had to offer and what was
impressive though and it actually
pertains to this video properly is that
even cards like the 750 Ti and 260 X
which are like a hundred bucks and
change on newegg.com
we're both able to run the game at 1080p
with ultra settings at over 30 FPS drop
those settings just a little bit or jump
up to something like the 960 or 285 and
you've got a really solid gaming
experience for really cheap in
conclusion for a pretty damn attractive
looking game battlefront actually runs
pretty smooth on a variety of setups and
I never ran into any major issues feels
weird to say it but good job' a battle
