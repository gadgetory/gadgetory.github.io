be unboxing the MS ip67 a DD 55 as you
can see from the front of the box
there's a few things that MSI has to say
for themselves about this board right
off the bat
first of all military class - this is a
hugely important concept for MSI on
their motherboards as well as on their
video cards so military class means
they're using very high quality
components on the board in order to
enable a 10 plus year lifetime as well
as excellent power delivery to your CPU
which is one of the most important
features for the p67 8 chipset boards it
also has a three year warranty in the US
Canada and Mexico and features their OC
Genie - one button overclocking which is
convenient if you want a like a quick
and dirty overclock versus tuning it
yourself although you will get more out
of tuning it yourself we have four USB
3.0 ports 2 SATA 6 gigabits per second
parts support for nvidia sli technology
as well as well they're calling it ATI
crossfire X but I guess it's AMD
crossfire X these days I'm not a whole
lot to speak of on the back they have
their wink e3 BIOS utility for going
online we actually tried it it's a
Firefox browser in case you're wondering
and then there's a also their UEFI BIOS
so that is a graphical BIOS interface
for this board versus the older like
award style BIOS with just you know
arrows and enter + + - to change all of
your options we have a drivers and
utilities DVD throw it away we have a
quick installation guide we have a user
guide for these software applications we
have a full user guide for the
motherboard itself this is the Europe
version so I'm assuming that includes
English somewhere along the line
ok we also have an SLI bridge remember
if you do need a crossfire bridge it
should come with your graphics part we
have an i/o shield which is black tie
light like everything to be sorta you
know black and sleek-looking
we have four SATA cables included -
right angle and - straight and then we
also have a molex to SATA power adapter
just in case you have an older power
supply that only has a single harness
with SATA power connectors on it we have
there
and connector which allows you to plug
in all your front panel connectors to
that and then plug the whole brick into
your motherboard at one time for easier
installation there is the board itself
the p67 8dd 55 so the D in the name
means that this is part of their gaming
series from what I've seen so far the G
Series boards what differentiates them
from the C Series p67 boards is that
they do have support for their dual 16x
PCI Express slots to run in 8x8 X mode
for SLI and crossfire I'm going to go
ahead and remove this sticker and we're
gonna start in the middle of the board
where the LGA 1155 socket is around the
edge of the board you're gonna see we
have a six plus one phase power design
on this particular military class board
up in the top left we've got our eight
pin power connector in its ideal
location because most cases have routing
optional all most high-end cases have
routing options for that cable to come
up this way we've got our CPU power
connector and then we've got four ddr3
module slots supporting dual channel we
have oh look at this this is interesting
you come up in here and have a look at
this so we have it looks like we have
voltage read points but we don't have
the convenient interface soldered on to
it that you would see on the higher-end
GD 65 board so you can probably still
like put a multimeter on there and just
not quite sure if that will work all
right so we've got a 24 pin power
connector in its ideal location on the
right hand edge of the board and then we
have our SATA ports so here we have all
supported off of the Intel chipset 2
SATA 6 gigabits per second ports and 4
SATA 3 gigabit per second ports we have
what is a very low-profile chipset
cooler and then moving down the board we
have our OCD knee button remember that
is a toggle switch so on off we have our
reset and power buttons and then we have
support for front USB front firewire and
front USB 3.0 so that's a pretty cool
thing to have our slot layout is the
same as the GD 65 version it's gonna
move that we have to pee
see I slots to PCIe 16x physical slot so
those are going to run in either 16x
mode or 8x8 X mode if you're running
both and three PCI 1x slots so if you're
using two dual slot graphics cards which
is sort of the most likely configuration
for crossfire SLI you're gonna be left
with one two PCIe 1x slot and one PCI
slot for any additional expansion that
you want to do so now let's have a look
at the i/o shield on the back this is
one of my favorite things you got that
combo mouse keyboard ps2 port you have
one two three four five six seven eight
USB 2.0 ports a clear CMOS switch which
I love I love this feature although I
have yet to need to clear the CMOS on a
p67
board we have support for digital audio
in both optical and coaxial flavors
firewire Gigabit Ethernet two USB 3.0
ports on the back panel as well as 7.1
audio out cameraman wants to have a look
at the cooling solution on the MOSFETs
which is actually pretty slick looking I
really like it once you peel off the
plastic there's actually quite a shiny
glossy finish to the blue that is on
those and I really like the overall
color scheme of this board although it
seems trivial I am a shallow person
what can I say the back of the board
looks like the back of pretty much any
LGA 1155 or 1156 board don't forget if
you are buying a CPU for this
motherboard make sure you're buying a
core i3 i5 or i7 with 1155 contact
points on the back not 1156 it only
supports LGA 1155 CPUs thank you for
