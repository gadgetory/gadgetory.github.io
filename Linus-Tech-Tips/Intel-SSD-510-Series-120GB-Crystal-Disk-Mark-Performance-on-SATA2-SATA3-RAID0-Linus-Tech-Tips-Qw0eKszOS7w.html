pretty interesting to show you guys I
recently did my unboxing of the intel
SSD 510 series a codename Elmcrest SSD
and I've actually got some results for
you guys so this video is gonna focus on
crystal disk mark which is a pretty
well-established disk benchmarking tool
these days and I've been marked a
variety of different configurations for
the purpose of finding out a couple of
things this is a synthetic benchmark
okay so bear in mind that the results
are not necessarily always comparable
from one drive to another and it's not
always necessarily an indication of
real-world performance but I wanted to
find out in a synthetic benchmark how a
single 5-10 series SSD compares to two
five ten series SSDs as well as how
using the onboard SATA 3 six gigabit per
second port versus using the onboard
SATA 2 3 gigabit per second ports affect
the performance of this drive so I'm
gonna walk you guys through this one by
one here we have a single drive with its
SATA 3 6 gigabit per second you can see
here that the right speeds are largely
unaffected by the the wider data bus
however the read speeds especially these
sequential results aren't well mostly
the sequential results are significantly
higher if you give it a pipe that's
twice as wide to move the data through
so that's that's how the performance
compared as far as single Drive goes
okay so then we've got our dual drive
configuration so here I've configured it
in raid zero running off the integrated
SATA 3 6 gigabit per second controller
on my p67 motherboard you can see right
here that the sequential reads scale
incredibly well this is the best results
I've seen out of a to drive
configuration for straight reads ever
we're up near a 1 gigabyte per second
read speed sequential and we're over 400
megabytes per second right speed so it's
phenomenal however you can see here that
once again write speeds are largely
unaffected by the larger data bus and is
mostly the read speeds especially once
again sequential 's that are going to
benefit from that larger data bus the
reason
for that is that when you're writing
reading and writing more complicated
data it becomes more controller bound
and less bound by the actual by the
actual interface itself so just as
points of comparison I have included
results with these dual 510 series SSDs
running off an LSI 9268 i raid
controller card these are the best
results that I was able to obtain with
the raid card over here so you can see
that there are slight differences
actually here I'm going to move this
window over so you can compare them a
little bit more easily between the
onboard raid and the raid cards
particularly in the 512 k sequential
results right here everything else is
pretty close although we did manage to
get better 4k reads but actually slower
4k writes now that was with a fair
amount of tinkering around with the
settings but I'm sure as the firmware
gets updated on these on the high end
raid controller cards and as the
community tinker's around with them and
finds out how to get the most
performance out of a 5-10 series SSD
we're probably going to see better
results I've also included the results
from a Revo drive x2 240 gig so that's
what I've actually got on the test bench
down here right now and you can see that
sequentially bearing in mind we're using
random data with crystal mark this time
around so SandForce is on a bit of a
disadvantage here but you can see that
sequentially it is not as strong of a
performer as to 120 gig SSD 510 series
drives however when you look at the high
load random reads and writes it
absolutely destroys the dual 510 series
SSD setup so it's all about what kind of
workloads you're going to be using and
thank you for checking out my video on
the crystal mark performance of the
