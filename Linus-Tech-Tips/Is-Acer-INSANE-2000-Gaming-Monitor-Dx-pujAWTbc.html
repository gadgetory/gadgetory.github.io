the next king of the displays this is
the predator X 27 and it's got pretty
much everything you could possibly
imagine it runs at 4k resolution it runs
at high refresh rate a hundred and
forty-four Hertz it's got support for
HDR ten it's got quantum dot
it's got local dimming support it's got
a demo that just finished running so I'm
going to start that again
it's got G sync I mean it slices it
dices it's got a thing that keeps the
ambient light away from the panel so
that you can see completely focused on
your game what doesn't it have
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel there the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description for your money what
you are getting is a 27-inch monitor
that represents the best of the best in
pretty much every possible category the
one that I've got right here has got two
end points in points got two inputs
it's got HDMI 2.0 but then you're
limited to 4k 60 Hertz and gsync doesn't
work or you can fire it up with
DisplayPort 1.4 so that's when you're
going to get a CR 1 44 Hertz refresh
rates g-sync
and the native 4k resolution the most
impressive thing about this though is
that while they are marketing this as a
gaming monitor so it's got specs like 4
milliseconds and gray to gray response
times as an IPS type panel it actually
also features 99 points something
they're not sure yet this is not the
final display but 99 plus percent
coverage of the Adobe RGB color space so
this is really not that far off what you
would expect to use for mid to high-end
content creation
I guess at $2,000 you should be able to
have your cake and eat it too but you
don't always take that kind of thing for
granted other features include Tobi eye
tracking if you're into that sort of
thing personally I'm not but if you guys
love it I'd love to hear from you in the
comments let me know does Toby it would
you pay an extra hundred and fifty bucks
to have Toby eye tracking on your
product would love to hear from you guys
about that and it's got a completely
redesigned stand gone are the orange
accents so no more kind of splash of
color it's all black and gray and
gunmetal except for the RGB lighting yes
my friends I don't think it's working on
this one yet but the redesigned stand
has kind of a new angular look it has an
all-black look and it's got RGB lighting
along with the usual adjustments so the
only thing missing is
hit it but we've got height tilt and
swivel does it look impressive yes yes
it does and this isn't even the finished
product either we're expecting it
sometime in q3 I believe I'm getting the
nod q3
