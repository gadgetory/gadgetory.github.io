product this is an AMD fusion product
and it is powered by gigabyte so this is
the e 350 and USB 3 it features 3 3 3
onboard acceleration which we'll talk
about a little bit more on the back a
3-year warranty in the US and Canada as
well as Windows 7 support which it darn
well better support Windows 7 in this
day and age it has ultra durable 3 which
features a double thickness copper PCB
and let's move along to the back where
we're gonna discover some more stuff so
USB 3 yeah that's fast ok SATA 3 6
gigabit per second also fast USB 3 X
power this is a neat feature in addition
to their on/off charge feature so you
can charge your devices up to 40 percent
faster while the computer is on or off
and the 3x at USB power boost also
allows you to run triple the number of
USB devices per port that you would be
able to offer a regular USB port haha
for performance so we have an APU an AM
B dual core III 50 processor with
discreet graphics from the HD 6310
chipset I could call it a chipset but
it's not because it's all one unit so
this is DirectX 11 graphics and a dual
core processor all-in-one
we've got dual BIOS apart with up to
three terabyte plus hard drive support
which is a big feature to have on a
modern motherboard let's see what we got
inside so we've got a user's manual ok
inside the users manual will probably
find the usual stuff including a block
diagram here we've got the apu at the
center of things powering anything
memory or PCI Express bus or ma ok PCI
Express bus is powered off that as well
as our outputs in terms of video so
there you go and then we've got the AMD
Hudson m1 fch powering everything else
so that's your SATA your LAN your USB
ps2 even all that good stuff next you
have the board itself we're not going to
look at that just yet let's have a look
at what other accessories we have in the
cleverly packaged gigabyte box here okay
we have an i/o shield handily
color-coded for your convenience and
my camera would focus focus focus there
you go now you can even read all that
stuff like that okay next we have two
SATA cables one right angle not one not
right angle we have a Dolby home theater
sticker and then a multilingual
installation guide book with a AMD
fusion utility DVD so download the
latest there's your chipset serial ata
Network audio drivers so don't be
acrobat reader just in case you don't
have an internet connection or you don't
know how to download a buddy reader okay
let's go ahead put that stuff back in
there there let's get to the board
because that's the part I think we're
all interested in so this is a fusion
board which is very new and very
exciting it has an APU which is both a
CPU and the GPU rolled into one and is a
lot longer than that there you go
alright looks like the right size for a
graphics card
certainly not the right size for this
motherboard a little on the big side
that's okay let it slide this time so
let's orient this right side up here we
go so we have our CPU APU GPU thing here
in the middle under this we've also got
our i/o control center okay so that's
the Hudson m1 that is also under this
heat sink which is cooled by a single 40
millimeter fan for you million one
thirty millimeter okay we've got in
terms of layout we've got our four pin
connector in its I suppose ideal
location at the top left
we've got dual channel ddr3 so this
supports ddr3 up to 1066 if I recall
correctly but I didn't see any mention
of that on the outside of the box I mean
this is not meant to be a performance
platform so you're not going to be
running like ddr3 2000 RAM in it
be kind of pointless so here we have our
front panel connectors right here we've
got our 24 pin power connector here and
at the bottom we will find a PCI Express
16 X physical connector but actually
this is only wired for 4x electrical you
can see the pins I can get it to focus
adequately yet you can see the pins and
the slot in the socket so it doesn't go
all the way up to 8 X or 16 X it only
goes to 4x we've got our front audio
header right there and then we've also
got front USB 1 front USB 2 both of
those are USB 2.0 I'm just numbering
them here's our SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second connectors so those are full
speed SATA 6 gigabits per second so you
got full support for the latest SSDs and
all that kind of good technology hard
drives up to 3 terabytes ok on the back
we find 4 USB 2.0 ports two USB 3.0
ports a ps2 keyboard mouse combo port
whichever you prefer to plug in VGA DVI
and HDMI outputs optical audio out glad
to see this even though we do have HDMI
Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1 audio Hey look
at that kick it bites using screws on
the back of the board it's a nice touch
I appreciate that it's more secure than
pushpins especially when it's kind of a
full-coverage sort of solution where
you're actually cooling to separate
chips under there you want to make sure
it's making good contact then use screws
good strategy alright thanks for
