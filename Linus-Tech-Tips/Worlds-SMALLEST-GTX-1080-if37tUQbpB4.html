cards have been around for a while but
earlier models compromise performance
for their petite size not to mention
that they really really ran hot it
wasn't until the GTX 970 minis in late
2014 and the epic Radeon r9 nano the
following year that these pint-sized
pixel pushers became viable options for
really high performance mini computers
you can see our reviews of these cards
by looking up here but what I have for
you today is an entirely new beast so
attacks offering for 2017 is the world's
smallest GTX 1080
but how does it perform and who or what
is it even for ZOTAC doesn't really seem
to know they they say it fits a 99% of
cases then show things ranging from what
looks like a mid tower up to giant
server cabinets then show an example of
it installed in a case that could have
totally fit an average-size graphics
card with no other compromises what so
come with me and we'll cover both the
performance of this unique card and a
really cool use case that actually
benefits from its compactness
the be quiet pure bass 600 features a
versatile design noise isolation and is
optimized for different liquid radiator
configurations learn more at the link
below first things first let's check out
their thermal solution there's no point
in putting a better GPU in a small
package if it's just going to thermal
throttle anyways it starts with a copper
block directly above the GPU with five
six millimeter copper heat pipes
extending away into the aluminum
heatsink above that are two very
different fans the one on the left is a
90 millimeter static pressure optimized
fan while the one on the right is a 100
millimeter airflow optimized fan they
claim this combination produces an ideal
mixture for maintaining strong airflow
over key components the neutral colored
shroud and backplate are both made out
of metal and it features a basic white
lighting setup RGB fiends will be
disappointed but at least it shouldn't
conflict too much with anything in your
system as it's all black gray or white
for i/o it features a standard Pascal
setup 3 DisplayPort 1.4 ports one HDMI
2.0 B port and one dual link DVI port
and this is actually kind of cool I
guess it received a little bump of 26
megahertz in terms of clock speed as
well although as you probably know your
mileage may vary here due to GPU boost
3.0 which will automatically apply minor
overclocks to your card based on spare
overhead in terms of thermals and power
or throttle it down as needed when I
benchmarked the card against an EVGA
superclocked 1080 and an Nvidia founders
edition 1080 I found that it performed
pretty much right as expected slightly
better than the founders Edition
slightly worse than the superclocked
card those results were true in Deus Ex
mankind divided rise of the Tomb Raider
and ashes of the singularity so it
performs well for its size but why is it
its size well I'm going to pass over to
Luke version 2 for that answer
hey guys Luke version2 here I somehow
got roped into doing an upgrade to
Linus's personal media center rig how
did that happen well it's a fascinating
story involving a couple of jet planes
trained monkey in a pink and green car
but we all know that's not what you want
to hear about so well let's skip right
to it however it happened today my task
is to remove Linus's gtx 980ti
and replace it with the zotac 1080 mini
theoretically thanks to efficiency
improvements since last generations 900
series this will allow us to maintain
the same performance or probably better
while consuming less power and while
freeing up space in the silverstone SG
13 for an all-in-one water cooler in
this case the tundra series super slim
from silverstone the 10a mini runs a
little bit colder than the 980 ty did
which makes sense because it's a Pascale
card and it does have a lot of room to
breathe through the side the CPU didn't
do like that much better because it is
an all-in-one but there isn't a ton of
radiator space it's a slam it has slim
fan as well but it's a little bit better
and it does seem to be slightly quieter
as well which is good and there you have
it it worked
we were able to fit an all-in-one in
this tiny ITX case because of this
graphics card it had enough room right
at the end there to make clearance
between the radiator and the graphics
card everything was fine that's the use
case being able to fit more things in
your computer is the use case you're
wondering what this is for there you go
that's pretty much it it's a good card
it's slightly better than a founders
edition and it's slightly smaller it
might look a little bit weird in certain
systems if you have a system where it
has a very defined space for your
graphics card you want to fill that
space this card might not be for you if
you're going for maybe something that
doesn't have a window and you're not
necessarily that worried about what it
looks like and you want the capability
to do something interesting with it
later on maybe this card is for you or
if you're trying to build something
small and compact like this guy right
here then it would work perfectly tunnel
