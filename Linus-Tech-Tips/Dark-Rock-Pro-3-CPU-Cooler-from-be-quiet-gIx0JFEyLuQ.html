pro-free from be quiet the jazz mini
phone and tablet stand from Coolermaster
is now available in a variety of cool
colors from these great retailers click
now to learn more funny right just when
you thought I was going to stop making
jokes about be quiet accompanying ha
anyway
the dark rock pro 3 is their highest end
CPU cooler and part of their no
compromises line of products over it be
quiet that means maximum performance and
minimum noise you can tell that's what
they were going for because it says each
of these things almost half a dozen
times in the introductory paragraph on
the products page so we'll start with
the accessories inside the box you'll
find the massive dual heat pipe tower
itself a white or rather duel tower heat
pipe cooler excuse me a wide variety of
solidly built metal mounting bits and
pieces a manual backplate some thermal
compound and a couple of very
thoughtfully designed fan clips in case
the tube of B quiets renowned silent
wings PWM 130,000,000 air fans that are
included with it anti vibration mounts
and all that in case those aren't enough
for you and you really want to add a
third one now on to the good part the
dark rock pro 3 is one of the sexiest
duel tower heat pipe coolers I have ever
encountered it's not small and mounting
high profile Ram and slots that it
overhangs is not going to happen but as
dark as this product is we couldn't
expect it to be small right the
wonderfully shiny base has seven heat
pipes soldered into it that run up the
entire height of the towers and on our
way up we find a staggered fin design
with fairly wide spacing for optimal
performance with lower rpm fans that's
good for silence the fins themselves are
aluminum with dots on the surface for a
slightly increased turbulence and
surface area and to cap it all off we
find a gorgeous brushed aluminum finish
top piece Noctua
as much as I love them could stand to
learn a thing or two about how to make a
great looking cooler from be quiet but
it's not all about looks so it's time
for me to hand off to Luke to cover
mounting and performance analysis he
truly is a mounting expert and his
performance ain't bad either
I think it would be fair to say that the
installation process of
brach three was horrific it took me
quite a while to essentially give up and
get Linus to come and help me this has
only happened one other time it was for
the exact same reason I can't fit my
giant fingers under the cooler to screw
it in and it doesn't have any really
good way to actually do that they do
supply you with a wrench this terrible
little tiny miniature wrench which has
to be used either improperly at an angle
like this or properly but impossibly at
an angle like this which is not great if
I had a wrench that was bigger that
would help in terms of overall length or
if it had some sort of angle partway
through so that you could use it like
this but the actual wrench bit at the
end was going flat along with the
motherboard that would have been
fantastic they have neither of these
options furthermore as many of you know
our standardised cooling procedure is to
strap on not to a fans on to every
single cooler that we use to try and
standardize everything as much as we can
that was not possible with this cooler
due to the fact of how the the arms are
made and how the fans are made because
the mounting points for the fans are
actually Midway on the frame instead of
on each possible end of the frame so the
the wire thing that you use to strap the
fan on to the cooler is not as long and
it can't reach on a naught to a fan I
probably could have gotten the 120
millimeter fan to work but not the
larger fan so I decided why I go half
way and just use be quite fans on both
original mounting points like they had
it from the beginning for our load test
we have a 68 70 reference running
combustor just to kind of heat up the
ambience inside the case
also our 48 20 K is running at one point
three volts at 4.0 gigahertz in our load
test while it's running prime95 to also
heat up the cooler and that is our load
test for idle we're running the least
amount of programs possible and normally
this is a very standardized test but
because we don't have the Noctua fans in
it it is going to be different than the
other results on this sheet so it is has
the most amount of inaccuracy on this
sheet that being said it did lose out to
most things that are on the sheet
but as linus has probably talked to you
about earlier it is quite a bit more
inexpensive compared to the other ones
so what do you guys think personally the
mounting difficulties are a little bit
too much for me considering I would have
to have someone help me install this in
my own computer which is a little
frustrating personally but again what do
you guys think tell me in the comments
below tell me on the forum like dislike
