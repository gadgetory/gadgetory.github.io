you may remember that one time that I
had a little moment reminiscing about my
old model M keyboard so far out of all
the keyboards I've used in my life this
is the best most solid overall feeling
one other than I did have an IBM model M
and nothing can compare and I'm not
alone not only did someone else care
enough to re-upload that clip as it's
very own video but there is a healthy
second-hand market for these things and
you can even buy near-identical
brand new recreations today but in the
age of Bluetooth RGB and macros should
you care let's find out speaking of

description
now you darn kids today might think that
the model M looks like a basic
old-school keyboard but that is exactly
why it's special the layout that nearly
every keyboard uses today is standard
because of this keyboard from over 30
years ago not to be clear the QWERTY
layout has been around since the 1800s
but by the time IBM was releasing
personal computers in the 1980s
keyboards needed a lot more keys than
just letters and numbers and prior to
the model M these keys could be found in
all sorts of stupid and seemingly
arbitrary places the reason that this
board is different is that IBM put a lot
of effort even developing a 10-person
task force into developing a friendlier
keyboard letting focus groups rearrange
and large or even duplicate commonly
used keys the result was this board that
looks totally normal except it's missing
windows keys and a couple of other
things you see this isn't actually a
model M per se this is the zeroeth
generation IBM enhanced keyboard that
launched in 1985 as part of the IBM 31
61 terminal that's why it doesn't have
any lights for caps num or scroll lock
those settings would be displayed on the
terminal screen instead you'll also
notice that it has a five-pin din
connector instead of a ps/2 connector
like other model ends this is
significant because the model M launched
with IBM's personal system 2 or ps2
computer
that is where the connector gets its
name this is a second-generation model M
the most popular it was manufactured
back in 1987 just one year after I was
born and we know this because every
model M has a little birth certificate
on its back but why do people still like
these things so much after all these
years well it comes down to feel sound
and build quality model M's use switches
that are very different to the Cherry MX
is that keyboard enthusiasts today might
be used to in the patent these switches
are actually called catastrophic ly
buckling compression column switch and
actuator but most normal people just
call them buckling spring switches and
that's because under each key cap there
really is a little tiny spring so in the
starting position the spring puts
pressure on a rocker preventing it from
closing the circuit but when you press
the key down the spring eventually
buckles tilting the rocker to contact a
layer of membrane and registering your
stroke at the precise instant that you
feel the tactile feedback wait hold on
did that say membrane yes
model Em's are often erroneously called
mechanical keyboards but they are in
fact membrane boards which is why they
only have two key rollover just remember
that this does not mean that they use
rubber domes that is different or well
okay actually some model M's do use
rubber domes but more on that later
anyway the result is a very balanced
feel with a nice tactile bump and a 70
gram waiting for pure typists there's
very little on the market even all these
decades later that feels this good
but while the buckling spring switches
create auditory feedback
that some people find very satisfying at
least the ones doing the typing anyway
they also take a long time to register
repeated strokes making them unsuitable
for competitive gaming though you could
always just bludgeon your opponents over
the head when you lose because the model
ends are heavy boards the plastic shell
and the key caps are made from hard PVC
and PBT plastics that aren't painted and
don't yellow with age and inside there's
a heat treated metal backplate that's
responsible for the ends negligible deck
flex and it's five-pound heft at least
they were five pounds thing is not all
model ends are created equal in 1990 IBM
sold part of its keyboard manufacturing
division to what would become Lexmark
Lexmark continued to make these
keyboards for IBM but more cheaper this
model M from 1995 demonstrates some of
the changes including one good one
drainage holes to protect it from its
arch-nemesis water along with several
less good ones like a lighter backplate
and plastic shell a fixed instead of
removable cable a monochrome legend on
the key caps and rubber dome switches to
be clear they're good rubber domes but
still anyway the keyboard gods work in
mysterious ways and the growing
popularity of rubber domes led to the
collapse of the mechanical keyboard
business with Lexmark dropping their
keyboard division outright in 1996 and
here is where our story gets interesting
a group of former IBM and Lexmark
employees began slowly purchasing the
model ends intellectual property rights
except for the logo and the physical
manufacturing equipment that was used to
make it the company they formed is
called unit comp and that's where this
came
from it's a Unicom classic and it was
manufactured on January 15th 2018
because of this heritage Unicom model
ends aren't really clones but they're
more like descendants so how do they
compare to the original well if you
didn't spend the 80s and 90s typing on
model M's when they were new it's kind
of hard to judge the feel of a brand-new
Unicom classic against an IBM board
whose spring switches are 30 years older
but even if you ask the people who have
been using model M's for decades you
will still get some who claim that the
unit comps feel identical and others who
claim that they feel very different and
from a certain point of view they're
both right the eunich on boards are
modeled after the last model that
Lexmark made so while they have the
exact same switches as the early boards
they are lighter weight and
interestingly they can have
imperfections on the case and less sharp
lettering due to the aging mold and
tooling equipment so our final take the
eunich on boards are as close as you can
get to brand new anyway to the original
model M while also offering new color
interface and key options all for less
money than most keyboards of a similar
quality so as a well-priced typing board
I can see the appeal but my money would
go to either a more versatile Cherry MX
or an older generation model M off eBay
