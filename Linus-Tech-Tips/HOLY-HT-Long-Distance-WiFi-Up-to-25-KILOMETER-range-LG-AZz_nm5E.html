these right here these are this is some
cool stuff that we got going on right
here was to share the gigabit internet
connection we have here at the office
with my house which is about 20
kilometers or about 13 miles away
unfortunately
topography is a I would need a 60 meter
and 10 a tower here at the office in
order to achieve that so we are going
back to square one with this video and
we are going to structure this as holy
episode 4 yes we are already on episode
4 of this segment
and we're calling this one long distance
Wi-Fi
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so this is the
Power Beam AC a device that I assumed
would be a lot more expensive than it
was I mean ubiquity send it to us so I
had to look up how much it costs it's
only about a hundred and fifty bucks and
with the kit you actually get a variety
of things you get this saw weather
resistant plastic shell cover you get
this metal dish you get this pull mount
right here huh you get this fastening
rear housing doodad you get this thing
which is like a mount for the other
mount to mount the other thing with
degrees on it and then right here you
get to the antenna feed this is where
the action happens you also get a power
over ethernet adapter an injector thing
as well because it is powered using p OE
so on the side of this guy you've got
your power as well as your link
indicator and then four bars to indicate
the speed of the link and that's pretty
much it oh wait except you get two of
them because the point of the Power Beam
AC is to be able to handle a 450 megabit
link at up to 25 kilometers now we are
not going to be able to mount these
puppies up high enough in order to test
that maximum range but what we can do is
we can at least do a limited test here
in the parking lot and find out if the
objective was to share a network
connection with someone quite far away
whether it's a shed or whether it's a
neighbor or whether it's from your
office to your house if you happen to
live somewhere flatter weather this
technology looks pretty promising okay
so the assembly process is pretty
straightforward you take your antenna
feed and yet note wait should I say that
okay ah right you start with this
bracket you take this bad boy then pop
it under here it only goes in one way
then
you pop this into here until it clicks
there we go then you take your pulled
out stick it through the thing and
finally optionally you can put on the
weatherproofing mount something that I
would definitely recommend please note
and this was pointed out to me by my
editor the last time around when we did
this before our SD card died huh hmm
that this arrow corresponds to I was
sure there was an arrow this arrow right
here if you wanted to go on relatively
easily now normally you'd have some kind
of a pull down here so you'd go ahead
you'd put that on the pole and then
you'd tighten it in and it would grip
like that but because we don't have a
pole at least not that kind of pull do
you know what I mean we're just going to
go ahead and clamp it to a c-stand for
our initial testing okay so the POV
adapter here is optional if you have a
power over ethernet switch but not
everyone has one of those so we're going
to show it using the adapter yes we have
power then from there without dropping
it you plug into the network port of a
computer so we're configuring our
Internet Protocol version 4 settings
192.168.1.2 than 20 or over 250 for
whatever it is so I'm going to go with
10 subnet mask we can leave as default
when you click it on there and we're
going to set our default gateway to 1 9
2 1 6 8 1.20 and click OK and check it
out we're logged into air OS 7 so the
first thing it tells you to do is change
your password I wish that more companies
did this where they actually force you
to change your password before you can
do pretty much anything else but they
don't and such as life so now what we
need to do is we have to configure it
with a static IP address that is on the
same subnet as the rest of our network
so let's make it
that and configuration mode is simple we
actually have to change almost none of
the settings on this bad boy to get it
up and running which is very very cool
okay so now that we've reconfigured our
network settings we can go ahead and
plug into an Ethernet cable that is on
the rest of the network that we want to
share and then I'm switching back to my
Wi-Fi here because I'm going to use this
direct attached cable to setup the other
dish in a minute
but now we should be able to navigate to
it at the new address that I've set for
it wicked okay so now that this is set
up we're going to go to wireless and we
are going to set up the mode so this is
going to be station point-to-point so it
was actually already correct the SSID we
can make whatever we want this is kind
of like just a normal wireless hotspot
for all intents and purposes here men I
am going to turn our output power way
down because we're testing at very close
range here and I'm gonna leave pretty
much everything else on auto accept
security so I'm just gonna put a
rudimentary password on here which is
better than nothing
and I'm going to save my changes so as
soon as this dish here we go detects
long-range SSID with the correct
password it should connect to it and we
should have a link but first we need to
hook up the other dish for configure it
rather ow oh damn that hurt it is highly
recommended to configure these while you
are still very close to them not after
you have deployed them 25 kilometers
apart
okay so we're logged into our second
unit now what we're going to do is set
up our network settings us differently
from the last one so instead of dot 64
we're going to go 6 6 so we have to go
ahead and put this one then onto the
main network here we are very close
actually ok so we are on our last step
now we go to wireless on the second unit
this one is access point
here - peer so the SSID we used was long
range hey leaving everything on auto
turning the output power hey down okay
so the further the distance the more
important perfect alignment is but at
this kind of distance it really doesn't
matter much so I'm going to plug in my p
OE injected powered thing so this guy
gets power and then what you should see
on that side if you go around the side
of the dish is in a moment here the link
indicator should light up hey there we
go all right rock on so now we've got a
link let's test it out okay
so now what we do is we go back and
change those custom network settings we
go back to automatic everything liquid
you've got to be done I'm plugged from
the laptop into my pili injector into
the dish which is connected to the dish
which is connected to the server room
which is not disorienting at all from
there we should be able to get an
internet connection boom yeah baby all
right
okay now speed test isn't always a solid
indicator for us around here I don't
know what it is exactly but the good
news is that we're seeing very
consistent results here at least two
four and while not 450 megabit per
second and wow the upload is going much
better than the downlink that's very
interesting we are still seeing speeds
that are pretty darn reasonable looking
for our our dish dish Wi-Fi I'll sweep
that in here oh they have other tests
too so they have they have their own
internal speed test so you can go ahead
and go oh yeah I want to use this one
here's my username and password and
start and this will tell you the just
raw receive and transmit speeds between
the two units and we have a solution
this right here is a portable battery
bank
doesn't look exceptional that's right
charges boom and you see outlet so we're
going to use that to power the dish at
the other end of the parking lot now
there is one more tool we're going to
need that I didn't show you guys before
this is really cool this is the align
antenna tool so you can see right here
what the signal levels are in real time
so watch as I move the dishes so they
point more towards each other and the
theoretically signal strength improves
ah there goes my battery bank oh I hope
that didn't break okay ah crap this is a
lot heavier than I had hoped maybe I
should help you
no no it's fine I got this I get it
camera people Union can't actually left
a bloody finger to help me with anything
okay oh oh sorry I got this I got this
okay so I'm just gonna start hiking okay
so with poor alignment at the lowest
possible strength we are still seeing
about 200 megabit per second up and down
and that's with Edie standing right in
the way of the antenna way to go Edie
actually it didn't go down much so
inside the building you had to make
pretty big changes to the dish alignment
in order to really affect this here I am
barely even touching it so here we are
way down the road still enjoying that
was pretty much the same speed test we
were doing on the downlink and however
confusing this might be it actually
seems to be running a little bit faster
on the uplink
so there you go you can interpret that
however you want I'm sure with all some
tuning we could actually get better
speeds out of it particularly down
there's probably something where I don't
really know what I'm doing but in spite
of ubiquity offering to have one of
their engineers helping me out
I want to see if I can do it let's see
what kind of result someone can get just
following the most basic rudimentary
guide and there you have it holy long
distance 5 gigahertz like beam access
point point-to-point thing going on here
very freakin cool so guys if you didn't

honey can you imagine that okay so so
you know there's street hockey right so
everyone's all like karke
so you got your like Wi-Fi dish going
across the road it's like you're in the
middle of a like dota match it's like
pull a lot everyone whoever car car
maybe that's less funny than I thought
it was anyway the third way to support
us is right heading over to the forum

I think that's pretty much it so if
you're wondering what to watch next and
you're thinking wow these guys make
great videos how about checking out the
last episode of holy shit the one where
we checked out a battery the size of me
- attract
yeah we're trying to internet here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
