since I've unboxed a two-and-a-half-inch
SSD but the reality of it is there
hasn't really been anything new to talk
about so today I have something that is
new to talk about this is a new capacity
of vertex two from ocz okay that's not
what's new about it it features the
sandforce controller with reads up to
two hundred and eighty five MiG's per
second and writes up to 275 Meg's per
second that's also not new and it
features 25 nanometer flash that's new
so 25 nanometer flash is the reason why
this capacity is different from the
other ones 25 nanometer means higher
densities and it also means more
potential for errors so ocz had to
really tweak and rework the firmware
this is a natural progression as the as
the flash gets to be higher and higher
density there becomes more potential for
there to be mistakes when you're writing
to it so they had to work in extra
capacity that's built in for error
correction as well as make some tweaks
to the firmware in order to make the
sound force controller work with the 25
nanometer flash so that was pretty much
it if all you wanted to know is what is
the difference between the new vertex
two SSDs and the old ones so the new
ones are in capacities like say for
example 80 gig and 160 gig and the old
ones are in capacities like 60 120 and
240 so if you wanted to know what the
difference is the difference is 25
nanometer verses 34 nanometer flash and
obviously a different firmware because
they are using different flash but the
performance is pretty much the same the
reliability is pretty much the same
because of the hard work that San force
an ocz do on their products to make sure
that they don't die speaking of not
dying ah let me just double check here
but I'll let you guys know what the
warranty is for this particular drive
last time I checked I think it was two
years we're gonna have to check that I
think there's a card inside that tells
it actually old here's something new on
their packaging Mac check that out so
this SSD is completely windows and
or mac compatible oh yeah if you want to
see the general specs here it is zoomed
in you can pause that and read that if
you want to so that's the full specs
other than that they haven't changed the
packaging much it still includes a tuna
half inch to three and a half inch drive
adapter I don't see any screws so I hope
you have some screws are fitted with
your case you probably do ok so that
just goes in there slips into the back
of the foam packaging and on the other
side we find a couple things first my
SSD is faster than your HDD that is hard
disk drive or solid-state drive and yes
yes it is it's faster than any hard disk
drive out there all right here we are
our warranty stuff I can epitomize a new
vanguard of quality products warranted
test tube you should conform to ok
duration of three years ok there we go
three years on the vertex two oh there's
the screws ok so that's all the screws
you'll need for mounting the drive with
the adapter so if you don't have a case
like the fractal design define our three
or any other case that has two and a
half inch drive mounts then you will
need to use that adapter and you can use
that to mount it anywhere a three and a
half inch ride would go so have a look
at the SSD itself which looks pretty
much the same as any other vertex to SSD
from ocz you got your standard SATA to
remember this is still Seita to
interface there's your data there's your
power here's some looks like there were
some jumper pins there but they are not
part of the final design and then here
we've got the ok rated for DC 5 volt so
do not drop do not press be careful with
it basically warranty Boyd if remove so
don't try and remove the covering from
it you got your standard mounting holes
on the side on the bottom so this is
going to be compatible pretty much any
laptop out there as well I actually
actually recently installed an SSD in a
laptop for my aunt which i unboxed it
was a sony vaio a little while back so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the new all new and improved ocz
vertex 2 25 nanometer so that is 80 gig
in 160 gig right now and who knows what
else is coming
because one of the big improvements with
higher density flash is that we're going
to see bigger capacities and lower
prices over the next coming months don't
