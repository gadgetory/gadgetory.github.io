to I think this is like my 5th or 6th
livestream something like that either
way I think I'm getting a little bit
more used to the routine I see there's
lots and lots of people joining us in
the chat already actually not that many
but we're starting so you know hopefully
more people will will tune in soon I've
got a lot of really cool stuff to talk
about today and as usual we'll be doing
a fair amount of Q&amp;amp;A mostly on Twitter
so guys if you're not already following
me on Twitter make sure that you put in
the thing that's like the at symbol or
something at symbol minus tech follow me
on Twitter because that is the way to
interact with the show however there are
some challenges with twitter twitter is
not actually the best platform ever and
you know what actually I've come up with
another topic for tonight's live stream
and that is the fact that I absolutely
hate HootSuite it's the stupidest thing
ever and I'm going to show you guys all
the reasons I hate it and I really hope
someone from Twitter or HootSuite or
someone who knows someone who knows
someone at HootSuite is watching this
because yeah it's not very good whoa and
I've got an audio echo going here hold
on a second i'm gonna go ahead and turn
that that they're down and of course
because my cat chewed up my hold on Oh
can't take that right now because my cat
chewed up my volume control I actually
have a really hard time adjusting it
yeah it won't won't turn off come on
there we go there we go all right so
let's open that back up HootSuite it's
not very good there's my note for later
so I guess what we'll do is we'll just
get started here so huge well first of
all I guess thanks for tuning in guys
we've got like 300 people watching
already so that's that's outstanding
given that I haven't you know what let's
give the guys who are waiting for the
YouTube video let's give them a chance
to tune and I'm actually super impressed
with and yes the giveaway announcement
will be today and I'm sorry for that
tweet where I called it a gtx 670
it is not a 670 my bad it is a gtx 660ti
which is also a perfectly good graphics
card and by perfectly good i mean
awesome so so yeah we're gonna do that
later and where was I going with that
yes to doing late oh yes right my
youtube video isn't even up yet so the
YouTube viewers haven't even had a
chance to tune in because the first
recording i did--like i do a recording
and then i upload that to youtube so the
bacon tune in and then they can see the
live stream but unfortunately the first
one i recorded didn't have any sound so
I uploaded it and fortunately I realized
that it had no sound before anyone
actually anyone actually looked at it
and I I mean I know I have technical
problems with my videos sometimes but
yeah I'm trying to avoid them trying to
avoid them as much as possible so let's
say if I just want to make sure that
videos up let's go ahead and check if
the YouTube viewers are going to have a
chance to tune in yet yes it is up there
are 9 comments and five views and port
pour this guy I mean what what what is
this name here I I have like I have no
idea I have no idea what this name is
here check this out like I don't stand a
chance of reading this anyway he just
wants to go to work and I'm very sorry
that my livestream is going to be
interfering with work because that's
that's very sad and I hope that you do
tune in either way so I guess let's get
started topic number one today is in
videos green light I'd love to see on on
Twitter or on the chat on twitch who
here is familiar with what green light
refers to okay Oscar says Venezuela says
hi that's cool Oscar hi de Venezuela as
well okay jason says hey Linus your live
is the speed of your RAM important to
overclocking know generally speaking not
really it's um it's less of a factor now
that we have unlocked processor so Ram
didn't matter back in the day when AMD
had unlocked multipliers and then Ram
mattered a lot in the in the socket 478
days Ram was everything getting high
performance high frequency round was the
only way you were going to get the
maximum overclock out of your CPU and
then both Intel name do you now have
unlocked processors so you actually
don't even need to adjust your ram speed
in order to get whatever overclocking
you want Adrian wants to know how I know
Logan honestly I don't really know Logan
I've never met him in person just we've
exchanged tweets and emails and YouTube
private messages over the last sort of
while here that's that's about it we
only really know each other through like
like the YouTube the YouTube Brotherhood
so I i I'm late tonight Brian I am NOT
late tonight I was exactly on time I was
about as on time as someone could ever
be for a live stream that starts when
they show up so no matter what I do no
matter what I do I'm on time so no one
not familiar with green light oh this is
great green light is extremely
interesting so it started with the Fermi
architecture cards and what green light
basically is is okay let's say galaxy
for example galaxy um colorful palette
actually I don't know if colorful is a
geforce partner I don't remember
whatever they're not in North America so
let's go with the geforce partners msi
Susi vga all of these guys what green
light means is they create a design for
a card so if you guys aren't familiar
with how an atom board partner works
basically nvidia designs a chipset so
that's a that's a gk104 for example
gk104 is the chip that's on a 660 ti
it's also the chip on a 670 06 18 is 690
but there's two of them so they have a
chipset then they do a reference design
where they take that chipset and they
completely design a product around it so
they'll put on a memory amount of memory
and they'll put like a suggested memory
ram speed frequency timings they'll
design like a power delivery system and
they'll make a PCB for it they'll do a
cooler that is a reference card so it's
actually designed in every possible way
by Nvidia although Nvidia manufacturers
nothing Nvidia's chips themselves are
manufactured by a third party such as
TSMC
their cards themselves are actually
usually very well not usually they're
always manufactured by someone else as
well so when Nvidia does like a new
launch for example if they want to a
reference gtx680 that means one of their
ad inboard partners was probably
contracted to produce all the reference
six 80s which then the other partners
have to put their sticker on and you
know they're kind of doing it as a favor
for NVIDIA so they probably don't make a
whole lot of money on it and all of that
but that's okay reference design right
now the adhan board partners are more
than welcome to design their own many
aspects of the GPS so you've seen you
know EVGA with their up teen billion
different versions of every GPU or
they've got a super clock and a super
super clock and for the win enough for
the win plus in a super super clock plus
and a classified they've got so many
cards so some of those have different
cooling solutions some of them have
different clock speeds some of them have
different power delivery which will
enable better overclocking some of them
will have different amounts of RAM so
they might be two gigs three gigs for
gigs six gigs doesn't matter these are
all the different things that the atom
board partners can do they can add
different display outputs so great
example was EVGA s570 HD where they
actually added and this isn't a 570 but
they added a DisplayPort out which none
of the other five 70s really had they
were mostly dual DVI with a mini HDMI
another example would be galaxies 570
MDT which actually had triple display
outputs on a 570 before Nvidia
officially introduced that feature with
the 600 series okay so we've got
reference designs then we have added
board partner designs and that's
anything that was designed by someone
other than nvidia and doesn't look like
that standard nvidia card okay so green
light means that nvidia has to approve
or give the green light the go-ahead to
any design that a manufacturer submits
before it gets released to market so
what does this mean there's a lot of
different sides to the story so I'm
going to give you guys a little bit of
the history of what's happened to bring
the green light program to light
to light some green light to light
recently so number one is MSI's power
edition cards their power edition cards
their hawk edition cards nvidia has a
certain spec so you know this is aside
from the cooler and the clock speed
whatever they have a certain spec for
how much voltage they won't apply to the
GPU how much voltage they won't apply to
different parts of the kit that is used
to make up this graphics card where the
atom board partner can design all the
other stuff and what ms i was doing was
they were allowing the GPUs to be over
voltage and overclocked in a way that
nvidia did not authorize now Tom's
Hardware did a fantastic article
actually was the German site that I
think did the original article but
there's an English version that's sort
of shorter and easier to read for people
who don't read German like me and what
they basically discovered was the MSI
was dramatically over voltage one of the
components on this board in order to
achieve the results they were getting I
mean a 660 ti power edition when maximum
overclocked could actually run right
there with a gtx 670 reference card when
they were both at their maximal
overclocks which basically means you'd
have to have rocks in your head in order
to buy a 670 reference card when this
660ti power edition was just as fast
once you overclocked it so so they
discovered that's that's what they were
doing it was also then discovered that
msi is revising the cards in order to
adhere to nvidia's guidelines with
respect to GPU voltages and and the
overall design of the card to get it
sort of green lighted again now green
light doesn't mean that msi cannot
release the product you can see they
released the 660 ti power edition even
though it was not running according to
spec so what NVIDIA has basically come
out and said in the last last day or so
is that it's not a matter of them red
lighting a product they're not saying
okay you can't release this product to
the market but what they are saying to
the adhan board partners is if you
really
this product we are not going to
warranty the components that you bought
from us so basically they're voiding the
adhan board partners warranty for
overclocking outside of the certain
threshold that nvidia wants overclocked
another example is EVGA 680 classified
that is no longer sold with the EV
bought utility that allowed it to be
over voltage ok so a couple different
ways to to interpret this number one is
you can kind of go raw raw raw rabble
rabble rabble nvidia is limiting the
board partners in terms of what they can
do in the terms of the designs they can
bring to market the performance they can
deliver to gamers so that's that's one
perspective the other perspective is
this is from nvidia scamp is that the
green light program is designed to
improve the reliability and the
consistency of the experience for
geforce GPUs for gamers so Nvidia has an
internal philosophy that and I agree
with them a hundred percent on this that
if your video card dies after a year or
two that's not a good thing and that
that's going to create a bad customer
experience a bad experience around the
GeForce experience and nvidia is deeply
concerned with what kind of an
experience the customer has whether they
buy a gallic galaxy card and EBT card
asus whoever it doesn't matter from
their perspective they want to make sure
no matter who the customer chooses they
get a great experience so very valuating
things on this greenlight program
they're evaluating acoustics they're
evaluating the temperatures they're
evaluating the size of the GPS making
sure that the customer is gonna have a
great experience so from their
perspective they're kind of sitting here
going okay we did all the work on this
we understand how this chip works down
to its very like microscopic level we've
done all the testing and determined what
is a safe voltage in terms of the heat
that it's going to output you know
whether the cooling design can handle it
or whatever else what is a safe voltage
in terms of the longevity of the chip
they have bend the chip
so their level so remember guys a gk104
GPU is exactly the same GPU exactly the
same thing whether it's in a 660 ti of
67 or 68 e so what is the difference the
difference is that they actually take
these CPUs and they sort them into which
ones are validated 46 8670 660 ti
operational speeds as well as the number
of functional units that are enabled ok
so Nvidia is basically our ok look well
we already been these for you we told
you what voltage is safe to run the mat
from a reliability in a heat output
perspective and if you want to go ahead
and turn them up that's fine but the
onus is going to be on you to support
these things once they're out there in
the market because this is not what we
designed them to be used for so who's
right actually that's outside the scope
of this conversation but I would love to
get your comments on Twitter and have a
look at what you guys think about the
green light program and whether okay you
guys are just like you guys are just not
talking about this at all ok please
please at line is tech tweet that
direction tweet and let me know what do
you think of the green light program
whose side are you on are you with the
adhan board partners who are basically
going ok well we should be able to take
this thing that we bought from you in
video we should be able to do whatever
we want with it and you should warranty
it because you know we're your partners
or do you take the other perspective and
go well nvidia kind of has the right to
set a warranty termina mean they're not
telling the partners that can't do it
they're just saying we're not going to
warranty it because you used it outside
of the oven it's like if you use your
fridge to cool your pc you're not going
to get warranty for that it's like a
consumer TV actually consumer TVs are a
great example toshiba i believe is the
only brand that will actually warranty a
consumer TV the instant you put it into
a commercial environment so if you use a
sony tv samsung TV in your business in
your restaurant you have TV displayed
you want it up on the wall the second
you put that in there your warranty is
void because it is not valid for
commercial use so it's not like this is
an uncommon thing okay we finally have
some interactions let's have a look
what people say all right did you do to
do oh wow we've got a lot of responses
now yay way to go guys okay nicholas
nvidia side um Ria's we're not talking
about that right now jordan nvidia is
taking a stand I like it they aren't
limiting us we'd still have both options
no Jordan something I would bring up
about your point here is that we
actually don't have both options every
partner that I'm aware of that had asked
you that was not warranty able under
green light has pulled that skew back so
effectively by pulling the warranty out
of them they have removed those options
from the market whether they're correct
about it or not is sort of the debate
we're having here but we don't really
have a choice anymore so they're
something to bear in mind hi nvidia is
correct nvidia and vidya nvidia are in
the right here ryan says what's going to
happen to the existing 660 ti so well
for the power edition from MSI which is
the example I focused on a lot here on
any that were already released are going
to be what they are and so they'll
perform a little better and then the new
ones that are redesigned will be under
the same name they'll be the same skew
and they'll have slightly less
overclocking potential you won't be able
to crank up the voltage as much and that
will be that okay fax says nvidia has
the right to control their warranty Alex
I'm with NVIDIA they shouldn't have to
warranty something that's not designed
for so it looks like by and large you
guys are both are all very much on the
green light and video side which is very
interesting because a lot of the time
consumers and I'm not going to
generalize you guys hear anything like
that but a lot of the time consumers are
not very quick to side with sort of the
multi-billion dollar international
company in this case I can see it from
both perspectives because what Nvidia is
effectively done is they've taken
something the GPU partners have always
taken for granted they've always been
able to do this before and it's always
been one of the ways that they can
compete against each other because it's
not like Nvidia supports every partner
equally I mean they try to do their best
but it's like know if you have like ten
children there's bound to be one that's
your favorite or whatever else
so one of the ways that the GPU partners
could use to differentiate from each
other has been taken away so I can see
why particularly some of the partners
that relied on this would be really
upset it's like them should your kids
have an ice cream every Saturday you
know what it there's nothing wrong with
giving them an ice cream every Saturday
if they're being good are the kids are
the kids wrong when they say well we're
still being good and the expectation was
always that if we were really good we
were gonna get ice cream on Saturday and
now you're saying no ice cream anymore
um I don't know I don't know I don't
have I don't have the right answer here
but uh okay nvidia side and videos on
the right Matthew so say my name that's
creepy dude creepy creepy creepy oh wait
you didn't mean it like that alright
what else we got here so we've got about
another 65 results which means i can't
read all of them but i am going to do a
quick skim here once i get down to whoa
we have a lot of lot of tweets here
Matthew something something I don't know
whatever let's just look at them what
ability they do better what is
possibility change motherboard is it
going to be descending videos correct
and videos correct oh I think I actually
went past it there we go on nvidia side
as the partner doesn't want to crank up
the cards Scotty Scotty you the first
one decide with the partners here I'm
with the partners because they produce
brilliant coolers and it just improves
the car's performance you're right it
does improve the cards performance so
here's an interesting take on it this
was um I forget who brought this up but
a EVGA s 680 was originally permitted to
operate this way and then now they're
not able to ship it with EV bought
anymore so effectively in videos created
this environment where skews that don't
really exist anymore okay so the power
edition as we know it for 660 ti doesn't
exist the 680 classified with all the
overvoltage doesn't exist but skews that
no longer exists have been used to set
overclocking records and set an
unrealistic expectation with customers
did they do this intentionally did they
not I actually don't know
and he has the right to limit their
warranty i'm on the nvidia side I think
the green light program is great and I'm
all for a good customer experience you
know what that is that is one huge way
to to look at this is that if Nvidia is
effectively improving the reliability in
the GeForce experience then how can we
see it as a bad thing hard to say I mean
what if what if the partners basically
said to you guys here we'll give you a
bios that you know if you register your
card will give you a bios that unlocks
all of the overvoltage options and you
will you'll forfeit your warranty would
you guys do something like that I mean
that might be the solution to all of
this msi continues producing the power
edition exactly the same way that they
always have and then they just kind of
go okay well you know we're going to
ship it like this with this bios that
limits all this stuff so we can maintain
our warranty and then we'll give
customers the option to and I don't know
how they'd track it to be perfectly
honest I mean it is all hypothetical but
we'll give customers the option to
forfeit the warranty that way it's not
on MSI's head what the customer decides
to do with that card and NVIDIA won't
have to deal with it either that way
you're just taking responsibility for
your own your own overclocking
adventures which is how it used to be
actually I mean overclocking used to
avoid everyone's warranty back in the
day so okay it is aimed you have a
similar process AMD i think is pretty
much they let the partners do what they
want at this point I mean you look at
something like the devil 13 7990 from
power color I mean that's a very
elaborate design that went into that
card and they also yeah they released it
powercolor managed to release it so I'm
with NVIDIA not warranting miss you so
I'll take invidious i dun want to look
for anyone else who's who's on the who's
on the partner side here I think we only
had one person side with the partners
through all of this and videos oh here
we go here we go Mikhail says I think
I'm more on the partner side because if
they buy the cards they should be able
to do what to nvidia is right tuvo okay
I'm unfortunately I don't really
understand that T tweet but thank you
Mikhail
are participating okay we're going to
move on from this topic now I see I have
a ton more tweets about this but as you
guys can clearly see it's pretty much
impossible for me to read and and and
analyze all of them but I just wanted to
share this whole situation with you get
your guys's thoughts on it I give you my
thoughts on it let's move on to the next
thing ultrabooks so my understanding of
an ultrabook was that aside from macbook
air which we all know hopefully we all
know is not an ultrabook macbook air is
not an ultrabook okay so we're clear
because ultrabook request the word
ultrabook requires an Intel license to
use it it's licensed on ask you by skew
basis for those of you who don't know
what ask you is askew reversed it means
stock keeping unit it's like one sort of
set specification of a particular in
this case notebook okay so it's on ask
you by skew basis there's no charge from
Intel to validate a notebook the only
charge involved is you take your
notebook we're gonna pretend this is no
book this is going to be my prop for the
rest of the night no matter what I'm
talking about so you take your notebook
you stop a shipping label on it you send
it to Intel and they analyze it they
look at it in a bunch of different ways
and sort of then they either give you
the okay yes this is an ultrabook or
they say no go back to the drawing board
you have to fix this and this and this
and it is not an ultrabook yet send it
back again when it's done and so anyway
so Apple does not participate in that
program so macbook air in spite of its
similarity to something like an asus
zenbook is not an ultrabook okay so i
would love to see some tweets here guys
about what you think are the
characteristics of an ultrabook so we're
going to go back to we're going to go
back to the twitter feed here 36 new
interactions of course of course there
are 36 new interactions you guys are you
guys are crazy you guys are awesome
honestly in the last week I've gained
about four thousand followers on Twitter
which is which is outstanding and I'm
sure not all of you were just in it for
the graphics card giveaway I'm sure
most of you were in it so you could
participate in the live streams and send
me messages and all that kind of good
stuff that's what most of you were up to
all right let's see anyone got a boo boo
boo ultrabook sock yeah okay ultrabook
school however all right here we go here
we go so let's get into what people
think of this whole ultrabook thing Zach
says ultrabooks are cool but I would
much rather get a more substantial
customizable laptop my response to zach
is this is the direction things are head
and then whether we like it or not Apple
has set this trend with macbook pro
macbook and macbook air that that's the
direction notebooks are going me look at
something like the razor blade if that's
not like an apple aluminum unibody sort
of inspired design then I don't know
what is you look at Asus Zenbook if
that's not a macbook air inspired design
and I don't know what is but anyway
moving right along so Joseph Ben you're
right then this part of it um ultrabooks
overpriced sliminess st ah Nicholas okay
so slim yes SSD not necessarily but I'll
get into that in more detail later Joel
says good quality good quality can be
quantified in a lot of different ways um
don't look again don't worry guys I'm
going to talk about this i'm going to
talk about this okay hi battery life
says jordan fast small and lights as
derek ultrabooks our Intel laptops that
are thin and light and good battery life
Joe I love your picture this is the
second time I've seen you on the twitter
feed I still need to know if that's
actually you though because that's not
that's amazing that burger is loads
literally the size of a man's head okay
battery life and thinness until I series
cpu SSD integrated graphics ultrabooks
suck not enough power okay DOM we're
sorry 60 new interactions okay okay I'm
just going to take these 60 if you guys
do want to participate in the whole like
Twitter thing I need you guys to like be
on the ball on your tweets because I can
only read so many of them it's a little
powerful battery life size and weight
okay i'm looking for a few different
things here guys that I'm not seeing yet
because there's way more to ultrabook
than I actually understood myself but
the we had one of Intel's field guys in
today and he
explained all the different aspects of
things that Austin Austin you can watch
the live stream after on the YouTube
channel so I can't I can't I can't redo
the whole thing just for you ultrabooks
are nice and wouldn't buy one so yeah he
explained all the different stuff that
goes into it none of you are getting it
which is which is awesome because I feel
a little bit better about me not knowing
what an ultrabook was about okay so
number one then then then form factor
form factor is huge so depending on the
screen size the diagonal screen size
intel has different specs for how thick
an ultrabook is allowed to be to still
be an ultrabook okay so if you have a
bigger screen size you're allowed a
little bit more thickness and it can
still be an ultrabook right battery life
honestly until isn't too stringent on
battery life the requirement is five
hours and that's that means five hours
of like real five hours not like five
hours of like you put it in hibernate
and you try not to like go too close to
it and it'll last for five hours no five
hours with Wi-Fi with using the computer
of actual general usage and Intel
validates this stuff okay however the
sort of the recommended what we're
seeing more commonly is closer to around
eight hours which is fantastic I mean
eight hours is long enough that you can
realistically use the computer and sort
of an all-day type environment as long
as you're putting it to sleep whenever
you're not using it and then waking up
when you are using it aha which leads us
to another spec so a lot of you
suggested that an SSD is a necessary
part of the Ultrabook spec it is not an
SSD is a great way to meet the Ultrabook
spec because it'll mean that you can
have a fit or form factor if you're
using like an msata SSD it'll mean that
your power consumption will be really
low it'll run really cool it will also
enable fast wake from sleep times and
overall snappy performance so intel has
a spec that says it can take no longer
than seven seconds for an ultrabook to
wake from sleep now when his name's Ben
we're going to have a couple episodes on
the NCIX comm channel featuring him in
the next next week or two so Ben point
it out to me that with an SSD
an ultrabook can typically and oh yeah
boot boot times are are probably looked
at as well though it wasn't on the list
of things that are analyzed so the UEFI
bios went very quickly the first time we
booted it up and it booted up extremely
quickly then when we put it to sleep and
opened it up it took less than to steam
those less than two seconds to be fully
functional when it was coming up from
sleep so I'm SSD enables that however an
SSD isn't the only way to do it you are
allowed as a laptop manufacturer to
implement a hybrid solution such as a
hard drive with an SSD cache the SSD
cache has to be at least 16 gigs and
with that hybrid solution you can
honestly with the hard drive you would
just wouldn't be able to meet the spec
until doesn't explicitly say you can't
use a plain hard drive but what they do
say is you have to adhere to this
performance standard which rules out
hard drives so with a hybrid drive you
can meet that spec while not having the
Edit extra expense of going with a
straight SSD solution so something like
a momentus xt or a separate 16 gig on an
msata with a separate mechanical hard
drive running in the shell these are
solutions that the partners can
implement so okay so there's a
performance aspect it has to use a third
generation core i3 i5 or i7 processor I
you know personally I wouldn't mind if
they locked it down to just I 5s and I
sevens I mean at the point where you're
looking at low power i3s they're not
they're not going to deliver that that
snappiness that performance connectivity
an ultrabook must have a high-speed
connectivity now until doesn't specify
what that is but in practical terms it
must have a USB 3 port and it or or
sorry or it must have a thunderbolt port
or both it has to have at least one
though one of the other things with
respect to connectivity is that I
believe business class ultrabooks must
have an ethernet port they can't rely
solely on Wi-Fi now all ultrabooks do
have to have Wi-Fi which makes sense
because none of them really have optical
drives and if you had no Wi-Fi and this
Ultrabook this like portable device that
actually you have to plug in every time
you use it would be stupid but that's an
aside at this point moving along to some
of the other things ultrabooks must have
right they must have Intel's identity
protection technology and they must have
Intel's anti-theft technology now we did
a really cool tech tips about Intel
anti-theft technology and i'm gonna give
you guys i'm actually going to give
those of you who are who are subscribed
to for not subscribed see i'm so used to
being like a youtuber those of you who
are following me on twitter i am going
to explain one of the most cryptic
things that i have ever uploaded to the
internet ever today so this was an image
that i that i uploaded today and this is
the crazy russian for those of you who
asked if that slick of course it isn't
slick it's the Russian look how Russian
he looks so that's him drawing an evil
mustache on yours truly so the episode
we shot today was really cool because we
we had me steal Ben's ultrabook yet I
steal I mean I didn't keep it you know
although maybe I should have actually I
couldn't have because I stole it I went
to a nearby starbucks where I could get
on the Wi-Fi and then I gave him a call
and we did kind of like a fake thing
like it was kind of fun we're like a big
I stole your Ultrabook and i'm going to
log into your facebook and I'm gonna
message your grandmother and until then
was like mold Oh Linus I'm going to use
my anti-theft technology which is built
into the Ultrabook at a pre bios level
so there's like there's like hardware
and then there's like like bare metal
firmware then there's bios which is
programmable you can be racing and
reflash it then there's your OS okay so
it's built in at this level and what he
was able to do and the subscription to
mcafee service i think costs like 60
bucks a year or something like that what
he was able to do is he was able to tell
his ultrabook you can tell it a couple
things you can tell it if you go too
long without an internet connection shut
off and lock you can also tell it next
time you have network connectivity shut
off lock you can't get around this
reformatting the OS will not help
reflashing the bios will not help once
it's locked so once he locked it and i
was sitting there
I was able to show the screen to the
camera and go okay there's a message
from then hiya this has been please
return my laptop and you cannot boot the
notebook no matter what you do which is
very very cool so that is required as
part of the ultrabooks back every
ultrabook must have that feature so if
you pay for the service then you'll be
able to we were even able to see where
the Ultrabook was within about a couple
block radius just using just using the
IP address that it was that it that was
registered to it when it was when it was
on the Wi-Fi so very very very cool
stuff I'm just going to see if there's
anything else that I'm forgetting about
the whole ultrabook concept I don't
think so i can see if there's any more
any more tweets about ultrabook and of
course there's probably like
1,000,000,000 oh okay change the
Ultrabook topic okay i'm sorry i'm sorry
the Ultrabook topic isn't interesting
for you something about Gangnam style
okay we're not talking about that okay
you guys are interested in ultrabook
fine be like that fine fine we'll move
on to a new topic okay so my next
actually you know what let's do it let's
do a short Q&amp;amp;A and then I'll move on to
don't move on to my next topic so I'm
just going to look for some of the stuff
Dom why do retail shops say one or two
gig graphics and not the specs of the
cart because retail shops you know big
box retail guys who rely on the
ignorance of their customers to make
additional margin don't want to tell you
any spec that will be helpful because
from their perspective like okay this is
a two gig graphics card so from their
perspective would they rather sell you
so this this costs like 300 bucks okay
so would they rather convince you that
the cheapo graphics card that they have
you know like let's say a GT 640 or
something that they want to charge 150
bucks for would they rather convince you
that that two gig card is as good as any
other two gig card absolutely and
because the customers walking into these
places don't have the knowledge and the
experience to know that the GPU the
memory bus the amount of member the
speed of the memory of the type of the
memory all of these things are way way
more important than the
mount of memory on a video card in fact
for any low end to mid-range card the
amount of memory is actually almost
totally meaningless because it doesn't
have the GPU horsepower to back up that
memory anyway so with that two gig frame
I mean okay you can take a GT 640 you
could put a four gig frame buffer on it
there's no reason you couldn't do it
that card could potentially hold enough
texture data in its frame buffer to
power like a six monitor gaming setup
but that GPU would only be able to run
that set up at one frame per second so
who cares can have all the memory at
once it's totally irrelevant because it
will be bottlenecked by the GPU power
long before the memory amount even
matters 640 could be a 512 neg card it
wouldn't even matter and the same thing
goes for even high-end cards as well so
something like a 660 ti unless you're
running surround you don't need more
than two gigs if you are running
surround all of a sudden more memory
starts to matter because it has the GPU
horsepower to back it up so it all comes
down to resolution as well as how
demanding the textures of the game are
if you're running high risk texture
packs now we're talking about a
completely different thing where memory
could be the difference between chugging
along at 10 FPS because it has to swap
out to the system memory all the time
and running at a smooth 30 40 FPS so
there hopefully that addresses the topic
of GPU memory once and for all let's go
ahead and have a look at some of the
newer tweets that came in once all 8181
tweets okay so let's have a look at some
of the people who tweeted sort of first
here so these are two minutes does that
mean you could also hack into the ID
theft thing to lock up someone's
computer I guess in theory I don't know
that that's actually been done yet alex
is in a good mood cool story Alex ah
building a webcam ultrabook a dip at an
ultrabook with amd's aps would be great
for portable gaming fantastic point Alex
Wagner so I don't know if you guys saw
my episode about AMD's art rather two
episodes on my NCIX tech tips channel
about AMD's ap use so what we discovered
is that as a cpu with dedicated graphics
yeah it's semi competitive with core I
like it does okay okay it does okay but
it's not winning any awards however if
you're using the onboard graphics it
wipes the floor with not only a core i3
but a core i5 core i7 doesn't matter if
you talk onboard graphics versus onboard
graphics apu destroys in tow so an
ultrabook with ap graphics would
actually be fantastic for ultra portable
gaming I am super excited though to see
what Intel's Haswell brings to the table
because Haswell is going to be very
power efficient and they are going to be
dramatically boosting up the performance
of the GPU um Derek says thank you for
saying my name you're welcome again
Derek david says I'd prefer GPS me too
but it costs more to implement so what
do you want me to say I'm sure that they
could do it with GPS is just that's not
the requirement yet Troy line is how can
I stop my galaxy s from discharging when
i'm charging it and using it could i buy
a different battery please Troy the only
thing I can tell you is I get maybe a
higher powered USB port if that's what
you're charging it off of there are some
motherboards that have like super
powered like 3x powered USB ports that
will charge things faster just make sure
you don't totally exceed the amount of
current that's supposed to be used to
charge that join Linus fan club what is
this minus fan club that is a bizarre
thing sir I will create a facebook
profile at some point but yeah I don't I
don't necessarily think I need a fan
club per se that's an awesome security
feature what are you thoughts on
sleekbook haven't heard of sleekbook
unfortunately what is the hot but dupa
dupa do would see improved what do you
think Kyle what's your favorite junk
food my favorite junk food um Lindor
chocolates I love Lindor chocolates on
the total girl when it comes to Lindor
chocolates rephrase says did you know
that raising a baby cost eighty thousand
dollars okay I mean that's sort of an
arbitrary number especially because
anyone starting raising a baby now will
still be raising a baby eighteen years
from now which means that those numbers
will be totally irrelevant because of
inflation and whatever else but yeah
that's cool okay uh Michael VA or pls
pls for sure so pls is actually closer
in terms of the technology to IPS than
it is to a PDA or MDA however I was just
made aware today of a new VA it's going
to be called H a VA or something like
that you know what I'm gonna have to
look this up but uh google.ca H AV a
panel no that might not be it ah benq a
VA hv a shoot i'm boned i can't figure
it out so so benq as a new monitor
coming that's using a new panel type
that is not a pls it's not an IPS but
it's similar in technology and they're
super excited it's going to have a
hundred percent srgb color gamut it's
going to have 178 degree viewing angle
so the spec looks very similar to what
can be achieved with pls but right now
based on what's actually available at
this moment i'm a huge pls guy i love
POS pellet don't worry nothing happens
to your warranty and 660ti plan power
edition nothing happens and the side
will still deal with it okay when can we
expect something something what do you
think of okay ye wants to know what do
you think of the future of LGA 2011
after ivy bridge-e will a new socket be
introduced for haswell-e right now i
don't think anyone knows for those of
you who don't have the context for this
question LGA 2011 is now two generations
behind LGA 1155 in terms of the CPU
architecture it is still using sandy
bridge-e for I don't know enthusiast
workstation whatever e stands for so
sandy bridge has been waiting hold on
sandy bridge no no sorry it's one
generation behind and once Haswell
launches on LGA 1155 it will be two
generations behind so by the time it
gets or refresh it'll be two behind so
what does that mean so it means that in
terms of instruction per clock it is
behind so single threaded performance is
actually lower on LGA 2011 and it is on
1155 in
bite of 2011 being the enthusiast
platform ok are enthusiasts happy about
this I don't know personally as a 2011
user i wish i had an ivy bridge
processor to drop in my system I wish
that I you know had haswell-e to go into
my system so that's the disadvantage of
2011 is we seem to be getting a bit of a
short straw in terms of upgrades however
the advantage of 2011 is that it's
getting a much more advanced so much
more robust overall architecture so 2011
when Ivy Bridge gets its refresh so
right now ok so we had sandy bridge and
sandy bridge-e LGA 2011 LGA 1155 been we
got Ivy Bridge then on 1155 this is 1155
we're going to get Haswell so until will
have gone through two architectural
changes then we're going to get ivy
bridge-e which will be sort of caught up
but still a generation behind however
LGA 1155 will not have more than four
course Intel's already said this they
won't get more than four course 2011
already has six course if you're like me
you render a lot of video six cores
there's actually more important than a
few more instructions per clock ok so
once we get once we get ivy bridge-e
we're going to get anywhere from 10 to
12 cores and these will be high
performance course because there's no
need to have a GPU core built in as for
what happens in the future I hope we'll
get has well but honestly I kind of
doubt it however looking back at LGA
1366 so remember 1366 lasted throughout
part of 775 you know 75 was still there
on the low end when 1366 was a premium
platform lasted through 1156 and was
still relevant once we moved to 1155 if
I recall correctly although I could be
getting that mixed either way 1366
lasted from multiple mainstream sockets
and there's no reason to believe that
LGA 2011 won't last through multiple
mainstream sockets it's got all those
pins worst case scenario they might do a
chipset refresh or something like that
but they probably won't change the
socket and I guess basically I don't
really know
nick says can i have a shout out please
okay Nick you are shouted riaz wants to
know can you please tell me what to be
the maximum temperature for overclocking
a video card riaz there isn't really a
maximum temperature it depends on the
card so unfortunately it's one of those
questions that I know you've tweeted
this at me a few times but I don't
really have an answer most modern cards
are good up to 90 95 degrees and they're
actually designed to run like that
however you can see what Intel a name do
you been doing with the last couple
generations improving the power
efficiency and improving the
temperatures that they're probably not
trying to have the GPUs run so hot
anymore thank you Matt I'm doing well
and I hope you are doing well as well ah
yes a mere great question this is one of
the other topics that I wanted to launch
into so we're going to go ahead and do
that now why is quad sli a terrible idea
for a gaming machine and i should
clarify i am ears question is actually
not as terrible so he wants to know
would you recommend two gtx 690 sr4 gtx
680 s4 extreme benchmarking easy answer
for gtx 680 s the reason for that is
they overclock better than six 90s
although that's not as true anymore so
you have to find ones that over volt
along the lines of that green light
topic we were talking about earlier and
just the fact that in terms of thermals
you will be less limited because you can
use better cooling on them by having
them separated now forget extreme
benchmarking I have a lot of people ask
me about anything beyond two-way SLI so
3-way SLI 4-way SLI they'll say hey is
this a good deal a good idea should I
get should I get dual 6 90s should I get
should I get quad 6 80's or triple six
80s or else and whatever else okay so
few things so number one power
consumption is going to go through the
roof number two the actual officially
actual performance you gain I did a
great video about this the actual
performance you gain from 3-way SLI oh
shoot there we go three dash way sli
Linus let's try searching for that here
so the actual performance you gain from
through SLI from 2-way SLI is actually
very small you guys should check out
video that I did a while back so this
was gtx 690 vs 3-way 670 and yeah you
should definitely check that out it's
it's kind of an analysis of the scaling
of these gpus as well you don't get much
in terms of performance now if you go
okay Linus I don't care money is no
object for me it doesn't matter i am
willing to blow this money on these gpus
I want to have a great gaming experience
I want the maximum FPS to which I would
reply wrong you're wrong that's not what
you want you do not just want maximum
FPS there is more to gaming there is
more to a high-end system than throwing
more graphics cards into it so I see
people and dual six 90s I guess is less
ridiculous than triple and quadruple
cards for this reason we've only got
seven expansion slots on even your
highest end board something like an
asrock extreme 11 where they actually
managed to implement seven slots on a
2011 board that's your best case
scenario if you install three graphics
cards nevermind for where they'll be
absolutely no slots left if you install
three graphics cards on most
motherboards you'll have no slots left
over you'll have like a pci slot or
something stupid due to the way that
they do the slaughterhouse if you have
for graphics parts you'll have none so
let's assume you have none where's your
sound card where is your raid card where
is your anything your HDMI capture card
for streaming your gaming or you get
your forecasting or whatever else most
importantly where is your sound card
anyone who thinks that sound is not an
important aspect of gaming and is
willing to compromise on the sound
experience use their onboard sound
instead of a tour is willing to use that
for the pleasure of putting in another
graphics card to get another ten percent
fifteen percent maybe twenty percent
performance improvement is just wrong
you're wrong because a huge part of a
cinematic experience whether it's movies
or games a huge part of your immersion
is the sound experience why do you enjoy
the movie for you
why did you I mean let's okay not even
today where we've got digital production
in great screens and most movie theaters
let's go back ten years ago when most
movie theaters had like little pops and
circles and sort of artifacts all over
the screen were you going there to see
the movie big yes were you going there
to see the movie on like this pristine
crystal clear screen no you were going
there to get absolutely rocked by their
20.2 surround system with huge
subwoofers because it makes for a more
immersive experience there is more to
life than more graphics cards and more
gamers need to realize this I've
actually made a point of retweeting some
of the tweets people have sent me
lightest you talked me into buying a
sound card holy crap I can't believe I
ever listened to those people who said
that a sound card doesn't make a
difference get a real sound card get a
proper headset get proper speakers you
will thank me do not buy more graphics
cards to graphics cards is pretty much
enough here's another reason some people
might respond to me Linus I need more
graphics cards because I'm going to run
six monitors or I'm going to run I'm
going to run three super high-resolution
displays wrong again the reason for that
is that in sli the graphics cards
actually don't build on each other's
memory if you have two two gig graphics
cards you have two gigs of beer in
effectively if you have two three gig
graphics cards you have three gigs of
graphics memory that is actually usable
by your system if you have four three
gig graphics cards i know i'm
emphasizing this a lot you have three
gigs of addressable graphics memory
which means that by the time you got to
a resolution that would benefit from all
these additional graphics cards in any
meaningful way you're going to run out
of vram oh which brings me back to
actually 680 quad sli vs 690 sli so
that's all right that's why 69 I forgot
Frank so 680 quad sli or triple SLI is
terrible because you lose all of your
expandability for your system fantastic
and then quad sli with six 90s is
terrible because you have a two gig
frame buffer way to go with your 2gig
frame buffer which is
not useful for anything higher than
about 2560 by 1600 single display you're
not going to be using a 2gig frame
buffer to get an optimal experience on
triple displace you'd probably be better
off going with like dual 67 I'd like
dual 660ti three gigs or something like
that actually no that's probably not
fair i mean dual 684 gigs or something
along those lines may actually be a
better solution than 26 90s because of
the limited v ramp so there that's my
lecture on triple SLI quad sli and all
those kinds of solutions that for
ninety-nine point nine percent of people
who aren't trying to do what whoopsie
daisies where's my where's my Twitter
there we go who aren't trying to do what
Amir's talking about where you're just
trying to set a benchmark record it
doesn't make sense alright so now that
I've done another topic why don't we do
a little bit more what I'm gonna do a
little bit more conversation Siddharth I
actually don't know a mechanical
keyboard with blue or brown switches
that has a backlight I think ducky might
have something but it's nothing that
I've been I've ever actually used so I'm
sorry I got nothing I got nothing what
you do do huh this is funny Alex great
suggestion actually this is planned Alex
rights in can you do a giveaway where we
have to make a nerd rage video and you
judge them and pick the best one I
haven't announced this in any way so
this live stream will be the first time
and even ones hearing about this but
corsair is actually sponsoring a contest
i'm going to have 5k 90 keyboards so
these are like hundred plus dollar
mechanical keyboards backlights macros
the whole works cherry red switches i'm
going to have five of them to give away
to the five best nerd rage videos
however don't start working on your
video now I can't emphasize this enough
I'm going to have rules and requirements
there have been fantastic videos that
have been submitted for my video
response contests in the past that have
been disqualified because they didn't
listen to the requirements okay you're
gonna have to pay special close
attention to what will be the judging
requirements and I don't want to hear
any complaining if you don't win because
you
participate correctly however that
giveaway is coming probably i'll have a
video up sometime in the next couple
weeks so that's that's very exciting um
CW any faults about the nexus 7 Nexus 7
is a fantastic value have you guys heard
about the price drop that's coming it's
going to be 199 for the 16 gig and
they're introducing a 32 game holy crap
like it makes it like the best value
ever it has a Tegra 3 processor which is
actually fast on like well peg or two
I'm stoked up fast GPU why's it was
pretty good but CPU is honestly my
galaxy tab 10.1 is kind of not not
generating a great user experience for
me these days Thank You Caleb his his
name was big something else we got here
Dale I get a lot of questions about this
what power supply would you recommend
this is sort of the general question so
I'm going to answer Dale specific
question when I'm sli gtx 660ti s i have
3 200 millimeter fans and maybe a Korsar
h 100 or 150 Dale you haven't given me
nearly enough information if I'd read
your entire tweet before I started
reading it out loud I probably wouldn't
have responded to this question because
the information you're giving me is
totally useless I know you have to 660
ti s which means you need at least a 700
750 watt power supply however you
haven't told me what cpu you have you
haven't told me well anything else like
are you running 10 hard drives in here
are you gonna have a whole bunch of
different power peripherals running off
the back of the USB are you going to
have are you gonna be overclocking fans
consumed like nothing people who tell me
like who asked me what power supply do I
need and they tell me all the fans
they're running in their system like all
those fans maybe like two wats out of
your power supply totally irrelevant
totally doesn't matter and same thing
with a corsair h100 um it doesn't really
consume a significant amount of power so
shout-out to sofa america i almost said
south africa shout it to that too but
you know um he sue says why do people
mistake earphones for headphones and
vice versa i just wanted to get that
point out there because it's annoying
okay he's sooo 272 new interactions you
guys are killing me here you know what
i'm going to
actually I'm going to launch into a new
a new topic here because 272
interactions is a fantastic point so we
are going to run through the math of why
I cannot reply to every Twitter message
I get since I started running the
contest I have received more than 1000
Twitter messages per day Twitter
actually has a hard limit of 1000 tweets
that I can send out per day so that
means if i SAT there and typed in my
computer and literally replied to a
thousand messages I would actually get
my account like I've run into a few
times in the last week they will just
say you have reached your tweet limit
you cannot tweet anymore okay aside from
that they split up that thousand tweet
limit into time chunks throughout the
day so you can only do like a hundred at
a time and you have to spread it out
through the day so I don't even have the
option of like lying in bed with my
laptop and typing like this or sitting
down and like hammering them away and
trying to get caught up because Twitter
is going to get after me after I do a
hundred tweets or so and say hey oh no
it's okay wait a few hours and then you
can tweet somewhere so um for those of
you who are who are upset that I wasn't
able to reply to you or you're tweeting
me and I'm not responding to you you
know what I'm gonna do my best that's
all I can do when I have some time I'm
going to fire up my phone I'm going to
fire up my laptop I'm gonna I'm going to
hammer out some tweets but beyond that
there's just nothing I can do the sheer
volume of messages I receive like guys
think about this okay go and read a
tweet and then like reply to it and then
time yourself now times a thousand every
day I have a full-time job I have these
videos I have a live stream when I do a
live stream it's going to completely
wipe out my place where I was and it's
going to absolutely destroy any progress
I could have possibly made at catching
up because in this live stream alone
I've already received well over 600
tweets so I'm sorry guys I do my best
it's all I can do it is not
mathematically possible for me to reply
to the tweets and that doesn't even get
into the point that once I reply to a
tweet that person usually tweets me back
which means that what was a thousand
tweets once I reply to them is probably
going to turn into more like 1500 one
side
to reply a second time and then maybe
even let's say half of those people
again reply to me again so now every
thousand tweets is actually probably
more like 1700 tweets by the time I'm
actually done addressing the person's
question so this is why I think I need a
forum this is why I think I need a way
for you guys to interact with each other
and not just me because I will die
speaking of which Twitter I mean if you
guys want to sort of find anything at
Linus tech and throw in your own answers
that would be great that would actually
be immensely helpful for me because I
can't reply to them all on my own
alright what else we got here tell you
the boss says hey line is how come you
haven't posted a pic of your kids
sitting in front of a pc i actually have
taken one but you're right i haven't
posted one yet i'll see if i can find it
i'm not sure if I know where it is
because my wife keeps track of all the
baby pictures in a lot newer says what
do you think of the gtx 660 because I'm
trying to build a gaming machine that
isn't that expensive gtx 660 is a good
options so is 7870 you should look into
both of those I'm mix as I saw the a
sous vg2 diesel uses adobe cs6 so
everything you saw done previously by
myself or by slick was done using Vegas
movie studio or whatever the cheap $100
option is because I'm super cheap so
he's using a real editing software that
he brought his own copy of and that is
one of the reasons that the NCIX tech
tips episodes have had a higher standard
of quality he's all he also knows how to
use after effects which is like voodoo
magic to me so Phil great question
there's really that nothing that special
about a 30 960 X compared to a 3930k it
used to be that the extreme edition was
somewhat justifiable because it was
unlocked so you could break benchmarking
records and if you like really wanted
sort of the the e-peen of having an
extreme edition and that was coo but a
3930k has a little bit less cash a
little bit lower stop clock speed and
other than that it actually overclocks
exactly the same so we're talking
performance within like 1% two percent
of each other once you overclock them
both to the max so
I've never recommended a 39 60 X to
anyone people do buy them I mean people
buy them it's sort of its coo yeah I
mean go for it you want to be extreme by
extreme edition but yeah it's not
something that I've ever really
recommended ah can you talk about micro
stuttering you know what I can't talk
about micro stuttering I don't see it um
micro studdering is one of those things
that bothers some people a lot more than
it bothers other people it's like motion
blur motion blur drives me nuts on
monitors lots of people can't see it at
all so Eric if I had to would I rather
fight 1 horse-sized duck or a hundred
duck-sized horses I think I could take
the horses because I'm a lot taller than
them and if they're the size of a duck I
mean all they'd really be able to do is
kick me in the ankles I've actually been
kicked by a horse before and before the
obvious Joker heard that explains a lot
table slapping you know that's a nice
lap and joke right there up before you
make that joke it was a baby horse well
not a baby she's a couple months old but
my family we lived in the boondocks and
we had we had ostrich's and pigs and
horses and all kinds of crazy stuff but
we had a baby horse so so one of our
horses we we bred her and she her baby's
name was Trixie and Trixie and I had a
little disagreement once about whether
she was gonna walk with me or whether
she was not gonna walk with me and she
was going to go off on her and do her
own thing so I gave her lil I gave her
the business if you guys have horses you
know you give them a little you pull
down on their on their halter you kind
of go look no you get them to bring
their head down the head down is a
submissive posture for a horse so you're
forcing them a little bit okay no look
you're gonna be submissive it doesn't
matter what you think about this so when
they put their heads up you know in rear
up that's that's aggressive okay so she
surprised me and she pulled away really
quickly and then she started doing that
whole like bucking bronco like up and
down and up and down thing and she was
you know going up on our front legs and
kicking her back legs out behind her and
she actually nailed me right in the head
so um she got me right about here
and there's unlucky unlucky there's no
scar cuz it did bleed she got me pretty
good I actually this is one of the two
times in my life that I have that I have
seen my entire vision just like I'm
going to simulate it I've seen my vision
just start to okay Wow look this thing
whatever it starts to go wow this thing
gets light even if I cover it completely
okay whatever that's the only two times
in my life that my vision has actually
gone okay come on focus focus focus you
got this but my there we go that my
vision has gone black so one of them was
when I had blood drawn for me when I was
super super sick and I just about passed
out on top of the nurse and accidentally
of course and then the other time was
when I got kicked by this horse but what
happened was I was like I was standing
on my feet she kicked me in the head I
blacked out and then I came to in time
to hit the ground and luckily I wasn't
hurt but man was I ever mad so basically
she got the old you grab yer again no
pull down gave her the old smackle snack
on the butt no you're not allowed to do
that she seemed sort of genuinely sorry
about it but you can never tell the
horses they're a they're a crafty bunch
so yeah that's uh that's that's my story
about fighting horses and the time that
I got got kicked in the head by horse
Linden someone's already asked that
sorry dude they're they're lower grade
panels so they're cheaper there you go
and air have the suggestions to use out
here the suggestions to use a Facebook
instead of Twitter in order to get
around the limit it's like guys the
point is I can't reply to a thousand
plus messages a day not so much just the
physical impossibility of it but the
fact that I just can't do it it's just
not it's just not possible um Christian
I have a question Bible the number pad
on my razer naga not work there's a
switch on the bottom christian in all
likelihood you haven't switched to the
wrong thing so that would be my guess i
could be wrong though I mean there's
always the crazy thought you could
contact razor and see if they have any
thoughts of it as possible it's
defective
they do the best ones to talk to you
about something like that ah missoula
wants to know what would I recommend a
sabertooth z77 or the new motherboard
from MSI the Big Bang empower honestly
either there were great options so a
sous backs it up with a five year
warranty which is cool awesome and then
msi has a three year warranty but there
had testing every single board in an
overclocked scenario so i don't know you
decide which of those two things is more
important to you and like go for it
they're both absolutely fantastic
options alright Brandon there we go
fantastic question when does a
motherboard really affect with an a
Brandon really affect performance ah the
answer is sort of complicated so there's
a lot of ways that a motherboard can
affect performance so in terms of the
features that it delivers so a Seuss's
implementation of USB 3 for example as
far as I can tell is superior to what
I've seen from other guys you'll get
faster performance regardless of you
know which we're going to see if I've
got one in my pocket you know regardless
of which usb3 device you're using or
whatever the case may be you will get
better performance from an asus chipset
from any subordinate as media chipset
and there you asp are there turbo modes
so that's one of the ways the
motherboard can affect performance it
can affect performance in terms of just
what features it has enabled so if you
want to run dual graphics SLI crossfire
you better get a motherboard that
supports it otherwise you won't get that
performance because you can't install
those things so there's that it can
affect overclocking which means like if
you have a better power delivery system
it runs cooler you're going to get
slightly better overclocking results
bios optimization is another way that
the motherboard can affect performance
and overclocking so the better they
program the bios the better the power
delivery is the better it is however
it's not the way it used to be it used
to be back in the socket 478 day
back in the socket a days but you can
actually like run gaming benchmarks on
one motherboard versus another
motherboard and you might see a ten
percent spread in terms of performance
which these days totally unheard if it
doesn't happen anymore that's at the
same speed at the same frequency that's
what I'm talking about and that was
because of the way that the
manufacturers were designing the board I
mean they were they were doing so much
more work at the BIOS level because they
had to optimize for the communication
from the FSB between this over the FSB
between the CP and the chipset and then
from the chipset to everything else
including the ram the second that the
integrated memory controller came along
with the athlon 64 the second that the
memory controller was taken off the
chipset all of a sudden there was less
differentiation in terms of performance
because there was nothing that
motherboard manufacturers could really
do besides routing the traces really
cleanly to the memory banks that would
affect the way that the performance was
going to play out because it was no
longer being relayed by anything there
was no like tweaking they could do to
this chipset there's just this
integrated memory controller still right
into the CPU so there's that um and I
mean even then though you know PCI
Express AGP these were features that
could differentiate boards you know
better implementations of the graphics
ports with something whereas now
especially on the Intel platform even
pci express lanes are implemented at the
cpu level so what's not implemented this
EP level now there's a few things so
there's USB 3 which is on the
Southbridge there saitta which is on the
Southbridge so really anything that's
built into the cpu there's not much the
motherboard manufacturers can do about
it besides helping you tweak more
overclocking speed out of it everything
else now okay so yeah onboard graphics
was another way that motherboard
manufacturers could differentiate now
that's built onto the CPU too so really
there's not there's not a whole lot left
they can build in you know things like
SAS functionality like gigabytes done
with the xix 79 su p 5 things like
thunder bolt so connectivity more USB 3
ports better usb3 implementations better
sound
limitations such as a sous is done with
the Maximus 5 formula these are the ways
that these motherboard guys can really
differentiate from each other but in
terms of performance you sit down you
play a game performance there's not much
of a delta anywhere um ah dude do you
have to have to have that twitter names
like I hardly even want to reply to your
message but what reason would make you
and your youtube career um good question
I guess I haven't really thought about
it I have zero intention of stopping
making videos on youtube if anything I
feel rejuvenated these days because it
was it was a huge milestone for me to
hit that like just huge I cannot express
how awesome it was to hit that 200,000
subscriber milestone I mean back when I
started doing this I would look at guys
with 50,000 subscribers are a hundred
thousand subscribers and I'd be like wow
that is amazing if I can ever get there
I will be so grateful and I'll be so
happy and and I and I'm there now and I
mean now I'm looking for the next I'm
looking for the next level i'm looking
for 500,000 i'm looking for a million I
mean it's always about taking it to the
next level and it was it was just really
exciting to get to one of those
milestones that I'd really set for
myself one of the first milestones that
got me really excited was the day that
this goes back to a Logan because he I
think he was still on the project of the
time but the day that I passed
tigerdirectblog for the number of
subscribers as well they've still got
more views by a long shot but but it's
it's a it's fun it's friendly
competition I mean I have nothing
against any of those other YouTube guys
it's just it's kind of fun to play that
game so speaking of that game one of the
things that's also rejuvenated me lately
is check this out so since I hit that
200,000 subscriber mark not only has it
not slowed down so this is socialblade I
know this isn't the best one vid stats
acts is sort of better but this gives me
I'm just used to the interface here so
check this out guys so before I hit the
200,000 subscriber mark so you can see
here this is my total number of
subscribers in this column I was
averaging kind of 300 subscribers a day
this is an anomaly I think YouTube was
doing a correction when I hit that mark
all of a sudden weather
perience people spreading the word more
whether it's you guys supporting me and
you know telling your friends to
subscribe to linus tech tips whether
it's people who just see that 200,000
number and it feels more credible to
them or whatever has happened over the
last little while I've been absolutely
overwhelmed with the additional support
on averaging more like a growth rate of
400 450 per day which is gives me all
the encouragement that I need to keep
the project going no Matt no matter what
so I want to keep talking tech with you
guys I want to keep producing videos in
fact who knows maybe sometime in the
next few months you might see me even
rent things up to a completely new level
spoiler alert stay tuned I can't give
any more details than that right now so
don't even ask what do we got let's go
back to let's go back to twitter shall
we actually you know what no we're not
going to go back to twitter yet i'm
going to have a look and see if there's
any of the other topics that i wanted to
cover so why 4-way sli is a bad idea ah
this this is something where i actually
don't have the answer for you guys but
this is the most confusing thing in the
world to me so we're going to go on a
little voyage of discovery here and I'm
going to talk about what exactly is the
cost structure of displays so I look at
I'll be back I'll be back in like two
seconds I just have to go get something
alright so the prices of displays what
sort of prompted me to think about this
was the fact that one of my buddies
pointed out to me that he saw a 40 inch
TV that was in the neighborhood of like
400 or 450 bucks 1080p TV you know what
I'm going to see if I can find it on
1080p and then TV sorry I'm just I'm
checking on the NCIX website here it is
okay so 40 inch TV I'm just going to
copy this too okay maybe you guys can
help me figure this out because frankly
I don't get it so we're going to switch
to this view here going to go ahead and
we're going to pull up a 40 inch TV
alright paste okay here's a 40 inch TV
toshiba LCD TV I can tell you right now
there's no such thing as a TN panel TV
so this is some kind of a VA or
something it's not a TN panel it is four
hundred dollars a 40 inch TV is four
hundred dollars okay so why is it that a
40 inch TV at 1080p resolution okay bear
with me here guys of them because it's
going to go on sort of a wild ride here
why is it that a 40 inch TV at a 1080p
resolution costs more then a 1080p oh
I'm breaking everything 1080p LCD VA so
let's look for let's look for a VA panel
okay so here's a 27-inch that's an amv a
LED backlit okay it's got LED backlights
whatever so why does it cost more I can
tell you the answer it's much larger
okay
got it so larger costs more actually
where was I going with this something to
do with large and pixel density and
something something something right
right right right right okay so a much
larger TV costs more okay so now let's
let's scale things back down again and
let's look at let's look at pixel
density so when we get to pixel density
all of a sudden the smaller something is
the more it costs because it's more
difficult to manufacture so tell me
something if a bigger device that
inherently has lower pixel density and
the smaller device this monitor I showed
you guys before this is like in the same
price range it's on super discount now
but generally speaking it's a
four-hundred-dollar so if these two
things cost the same thing in cost the
same in spite of the same resolution why
is it that this device which actually is
a 10 inch panel so in terms of the
actual size difference it's like a
similar ratio going from like a 40 inch
TV to a 27 inch LCD why is it that this
doesn't cost the same even though the
pixel density is actually significantly
higher this is also a 1080p panel if I
recall correctly this is a transformer
tf700 so here's my question to you what
is actually affected how is it that we
can produce a 40 inch TV which is vastly
bigger for the same price as this LCD
and we can't produce you know what I had
a whole thing sort of in my mind about
this and I sort of just totally lost my
train of thought so I'm going to give up
on this topic but the point is generally
what effects is it sighs is it pixel
density I can't quite figure it out
because it doesn't seem to it doesn't
seem like the cost scales proportionally
when we increase the size and then it
doesn't seem like the cost scales
proportionally when we decrease the pex
pixel density or increase the pixel
density or whatever else the case may be
I mean did you know that ipad retina
display replacement IPS panels actually
only cost like 100 bucks if you buy them
from
I was like laptop repair or screen
repair or something calm I give up on
this topic I'm sorry it's actually
getting kind of late and I'm kind of
tired so we're going to move into
something else and this is something
that I really did want to talk about
Paul's hardware and awesomesauce news
are two new YouTube channels that you
guys should totally subscribe to if
you're not already subscribed to raise
the world so I'm going to just I'm going
to bring up all of these YouTube
channels dot here and raise the world
okay so this is one of them so this is
Logan's channel from tech syndicate so
he is actually growing pretty fast and
things are going pretty well over there
awesomesauce news is a kyle from that
horrible horrible store in the US so
he's a he's doing he's doing his own
sort of vlog e style videos and I wish
him well but I think he's only got like
100 subscribers or something like that
see there he is look how sexy he is okay
and then finally we have actually this
one I haven't seen what pulls up to but
Paul's hardware is another channel that
you guys probably want to check out if
you enjoy what I'm doing then you're
probably going to enjoy what what these
guys are doing here so Paul only has one
video he's already produced only half as
many videos as Kyle so yeah way to go
way to go Paul I hope you're watching
wow look at this 43 dislikes and 0
dislikes good just for that I'm gonna
I'm gonna like the video so he now has I
don't know thanks shirt with your
friends I've actually never liked a
video on YouTube to be perfectly honest
I'm not much of a YouTube watcher I'm
just more of a YouTube maker what other
topics do we have come to do I guess
I've had a lot of people ask me about my
new gear that's coming so if you're not
familiar with my new gear conversation I
blew over 10 grand on new gear so I have
an fs700 camera coming which is going to
be awesome we'll be able to shoot video
realistically at 240 FPS if we need
something extremely extremely high speed
it can do up to nine hundred and 60 FPS
and here's like it like just I have all
these ideas in my head of stuff we can
do with this like
all of a sudden we'll be able to
empirically evaluate the performance in
terms of input lag on an LCD monitor
because all we'll have to do is take a
microphone put it next to a mouse and go
like this hit it so you take a video of
the LCD monitor and I guess you could
you could put the mouse in there as well
and then all you have to do is sync up
with the sound it made when you tap the
mouse and you'll have to have the
microphone link right next to it we
don't want the delay of the sound
causing any ill effects actually you
know you should probably keep the mouse
in the shot so you can really see that
point of contact and we should be able
to in theory get down to the exact frame
at nine hundred and 60 FPS okay 960 FPS
the exact frame where we touched the
mouse then we can count how many frames
until the monitor responds and I don't
know if this is going to work maybe it's
totally stupid maybe nine hundred and 60
FPS isn't enough but I'm super excited
to try it out so I'm thinking if we have
like a CRT on one side and an LCD on the
other side we can just try it and see
like how much if we take like asus has
144 hurts LCD and put that next to a CRT
how much of a difference is there are
the CRT diehards missing out by avoiding
LCD or are they still right is it still
the fastest way to game so so that's
something super exciting so my new gear
is coming next week ah so I've got HDMI
capture cards Cummings which means I
won't have to use this web can anymore
I've got new microphone coming I've got
a new tripod coming new lights all kinds
of crazy stuff so I'm not going to look
all pale and ghostly like this unless I
do look pale and ghostly like this in
which case um you know sorry dudes that
means I just don't know how to use this
gear that I you know blue a bunch of
money on which would be very sad thing
indeed very sad thing indeed 247 new
interactions okay so we're going to try
and do a little a couple a couple more q
and A's and then I think oh you know
what before we do more Q&amp;amp;A let's do the
giveaway announcement then we'll we'll
finish up with a little bit of Q&amp;amp;A so I
received and I've got my notes here you
know what I'll just let you guys go
through the notes go through the notes
with me so first I want to say the
winner and
hope you're watching I was my original
plan was to have it be so that only
someone who was watching could win but I
realized you know what that's not really
fair I mean anyone who does a draw does
a draw and then you get in touch with
the person who won before I okay before
I announce the winner I want to talk a
little bit about the format of the
contest the format of the contest was
wrong my original idea was that the
first one to complete the task should
win however I made some mistakes in the
task that made it so I couldn't really
do it that way so I required people to
format and punctuate the secret phrase
which they had to jump around to
different videos and check out and
discover and then unjam both so the
secret phrase I had them format i want
but from the formatted exactly the way I
did unfortunately I formatted it
incorrectly so the secret phrase was i
finished the quest where's my swag and i
had a period on the word quest and i was
missing a question mark on the word swag
what I also didn't realize when I was
creating the challenge was that I
finished my quest where's the swag would
also be a correct way to solve the
puzzle so instead of taking the first
person who replied exactly the way that
I had it written which took I mean there
were over a hundred correct sort of
correct like not what I had in mind but
correct responses where they added a
question mark or they they switched
around the the and the my before the one
who formatted it the way that I had
wanted in my head for it to be formatted
and I didn't think it was fair to do it
that way so what I did is I took all the
people that did answer it correctly I
dropped them all in Excel and then
generated a random number and the winner
is can I get a drumroll can everybody
drum roll please Bernard yep so that's
your email address i'll email you if
you're okay okay we have to go okay we
have to go to twitter though so there's
some notes here i'm going to go to
Twitter after Bernard if you're on
Twitter please message me or email me
again I can have a look at my email on
the other screen let me know if you're
watching I hope you're watching and I
hope you're excited because you are
going to be the proud owner of a geforce
gtx
660 ti whoa and the shipping's free
don't worry about it i'll cover the
shipping even though it's expensive do
you guys have any idea how much it cost
me to ship the Duke Nukem the Duke Nukem
nvidia price which was a gtx 580 I think
480 something like that 580 3d vision
monitor and a copy of duke nukem five
hundred dollars it cost to ship that to
the winner $500 unfreaking believable um
so anyway okay I'm gonna have a look at
my email over here and in the meantime
so yeah okay these are all my notes for
everything I wanted to talk about so I
accepted any of those answers so with or
without punctuation and with bhuvah and
the my switched around I did end up
requiring the period because there were
already so many people that did have the
period in there that but yeah it ended
up having to work that way now the way
that I'm going to do it next time in
order to make it more fair especially
for people in other time zones I feel
for you guys is I'm going to leave it
for a couple days maybe two or three
days I might have a longer treasure hunt
so that's more difficult but then what
I'll do is I'll give you guys a couple
days and then I'll have everyone submit
and then I will do a random draw and
I'll make that very clear from the
beginning I'm sorry that this wasn't
better organized and yeah so so you know
hey congratulations to the winner and I
don't see an email from him yet but you
know hopefully he'll get in touch soon
and thank you guys so much for
participating it's just been awesome and
I think that wraps it up for the
giveaway we've got six minutes left so
let's do some more QA and that is the
most terrifying thing that I think I've
seen today that that is that is horrible
dude he says I think I've made the best
t-shirt ever and by best t-shirt I think
he means the t-shirt that will like get
him kicked out of places that's awful um
I'm gonna go ahead and favorite that
that's terrific all right Daniel talk
about non-reference graphics cards and
fully custom liquid cooling what
happened to personal x79 build Daniel I
had an update on the x79 build not a we
ago so I'm still working on it i'm
hoping to get it done in this calendar
year talking about non-reference
graphics cards and fully custom liquid
cooling unless you have a manufacturer
in mind that has already made a water
block for your non reference card if you
want a water cool your card get a
reference card because it's very
different difficult these days to
watercool a video card without a full
cover block and full cover blocks do not
work on non-compatible cards so it just
doesn't work that way Esteban what would
you recommend gigabyte x79 su p5 Wi-Fi
or whatever or whatever ok or asrock x79
extreme 9 x 79 su p5 that I mean asking
me that is kind of like asking me what
would you recommend the motherboard that
you're using that you're using which is
that's the motherboard i'm using or some
other motherboard asrock is not one of
my preferred motherboard manufacturers
so I I prefer a susan assign gigabyte so
I would definitely go with the gigabyte
option there Marcus if you were to build
an LGA 1155 pc today what motherboard
and cpu would you choose you know what
great question but there's a lot of
different answers and I'm going to tie
this into what one of the other guys
here asked I saw something about talking
about ITX gaming if I was going to build
an LGA 1155 pc i would want to take
advantage of the fact that it can fit in
a very small form factor so i'd probably
go with something like an asus p8z77-i
deluxe ok so there's a z77 ITX board
then i'd go with something like an
external sound card like you know what I
don't have it next to me anymore so you
can't use the onboard sound on thats
terrible but well it's not terrible but
it's not its onboard sound so i've used
some kind of external USB DAC and has a
headphone amp and all that kind of stuff
so I'd do that and then I'd probably go
with a 3570k because I'm assuming this
is for like a portable gaming machine
and then I'd throw probably something
like a 660 ti in there so hey Bernard
there's my recommendation for what you
do with this card and then in terms of
case I'd probably go with either that
cooler master one that I just unboxed
the elite 120 I think it's called or I'd
go with a Silverstone ft 0 3 which is
wheat sweet case the MIDI won the mini
one ft 0 3 mini Joel what do you like so
much about the TJ 07 it looks like it's
showing its age to me something that is
timeless and classic doesn't age a TJ 07
ages like like a fine wine or like a
perfectly cut steak it is showing its
age in terms of features which I can fix
I can cut cable management holes I can
throw in mounting for whatever it is I
need to put in it but you cannot fix
beautiful design and i love the unibody
shape i love the size the efficiency of
the size i mean a cosmos to actually
can't fit any more water cooling crap
been a TJ 07 I mean maybe a little bit
more but when you look at the difference
in size it's the efficiency of the
layout of the internals that makes the
TGF 7 so appealing you can fit all this
water cooling crap in there and it's
still not that big like it's big but
it's not that big um Ryan is there sound
card you can recommend for a balance
between gaming a music enjoyment
honestly anything from the asuste line
the zone our line is going to be awesome
if you're using headphones get one with
a headphone amp if you're using speakers
get one that doesn't have a headphone
amp because it doesn't matter and then
as for a balance between gaming and
music enjoyment good sound is good sound
I've always taken that philosophy about
it maybe to the most extreme of audio
files there will be some difference
between a gaming optimized sound card
and a music optimized sound card but the
reality of it is if it produces clear
sound you know deep bass rich mids clear
highs if it does all those things it'll
be great for games it'll be great for
movies and it will be great for music do
I say movies or music whatever all three
all right one more minute left so I am
going to take the next tweet the tweet
that's at the top sort of going to be my
thing where I take like the top tweet
I'm going to click it now Michael great
question Michael this is a fantastic
question why do TVs have 240 hertz plus
and not
monitors fantastic question Michael TVs
are doing this okay this is your leg
this is them pulling it you're nine
hundred and sixty Hertz or 480 hurts
clear motion or whatever it is they're
doing on the TV is not a 960 hurts panel
it doesn't work that way you are not
actually seeing 960 or let's use your
example so your example is 240 you are
not seeing 240 image refreshes every
second hdmi is not even remotely capable
of carrying that kind of bandwidth even
the new revised HDMI is not capable of
carrying more than 1080p 120 frames per
second that's the one with the faster
processors on either end and whatever
1.4 a or something like that who cares
HDMI sucks but what they're doing is
they are not just refreshing the image
so let's say here's your motion okay so
something's moving across the screen
like this these are your frames okay so
instead of just doing this so let's say
let's say we got four frames one two
three four to show you the motion in
between each of those frames they are
flickering the backlight and that plays
a trick on your eye that makes so if
they go to flicks and one frame to
flicks and one frame to flicks one frame
it plays a trick with your eye that
makes the motion look smoother but also
has sort of a strange effect that makes
it look unnaturally smooth to some
people so when you see someone saying
this is a 240 hertz TV or 480 hurts TV
they are referring to the modulation of
the backlight not to the refresh rate of
the actual LCD panel so that's a really
important clarification that's why there
were so many 120 Hertz TVs out there
that people were talking about or they
wanted to buy or they were even
mistakingly buying with the intention of
running 3d vision or something with
their graphics card getting in a
middleware driver and they're trying to
do this only to realize that
they're 120 Hertz TV was only a 60 Hertz
panel it wasn't even capable of
displaying a left and a right image at
60 Hertz for each eye with 3d glasses so
fantastic question and thank you very
much for asking it thank you guys so
much for participating those of you who
are here live and don't forget to
