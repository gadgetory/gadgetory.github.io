to I think this is like my fifth or
sixth live stream something like that
either way I think I'm getting a little
bit more used to the routine I see
there's lots and lots of people joining
us in the chat already actually not that
many but we're starting so you know
hopefully more people will will tune in
soon I've got a lot of really cool stuff
to talk about today and as usual we'll
be doing a fair amount of Q&amp;amp;A mostly on
Twitter so guys if you're not already
following me on Twitter make sure that
you put in the thing that's like the app
symbol or something at symbol - tech
follow me on Twitter because that is the
way to interact with the show however
there are some challenges with Twitter
Twitter is not actually the best
platform ever and you know what actually
I've come up with another topic for
tonight's livestream and that is the
fact that I absolutely hate HootSuite
it's the stupidest thing ever and I'm
gonna show you guys all the reasons I
hate it and I really hope someone from
Twitter or HootSuite or someone who
knows someone who knows someone at
HootSuite is watching this because yeah
it's not very good whoa and I've got an
audio echo going here hold on a second
I'm gonna go ahead and turn that that
there down and of course because my cat
chewed up my hold on Oh
can't take that right now because my cat
chewed up my volume control I actually
have a really hard time adjusting it
yeah it won't won't turn off come on
there we go there we go all right so
let's open that back up HootSuite it's
not very good there's my note for later
so I guess what we'll do is we'll just
get started here so huge well first of
all I guess thanks for tuning in guys
we've got like 300 people watching
already so that's that's outstanding
given that I haven't you know what let's
give the guys who are waiting for the
YouTube video let's give them a chance
to tune in I'm actually super impressed
with and yes the giveaway announcement
will be today and I'm sorry for that
tweet where I called it a GTX 670 it is
not a six seven
my bat it is a gtx 660ti which is also a
perfectly good graphics card and by
perfectly good I mean awesome so so yeah
we're gonna do that later and where was
I going with that yes doing oh yes right
my youtube video isn't even up yet so
the YouTube viewers haven't even had a
chance to tune in because the first
recording I did like I do a recording
and then I upload that to YouTube so the
bacon tuned in and then they can see the
livestream but unfortunately the first
one I recorded didn't have any sound so
I uploaded it and fortunately I realized
that it had no sound before anyone
actually anyone actually looked at it
and I I mean I know I have technical
problems with my videos sometimes but
yeah I'm trying to avoid them trying to
avoid them as much as possible so let's
say if I just want to make sure that
videos up let's go ahead and check if
the YouTube viewers are gonna have a
chance to tune in yet yes it is up there
are nine comments and five views and
port poor this guy I mean what what what
is this name here I I have like I have
no idea I have no idea what this name is
here check this out like I don't stand a
chance of reading this anyway he just
wants to go to work and I'm very sorry
that my livestream is going to be
interfering with work because that's
that's very sad and I hope that you do
tune in either way so I guess let's get
started
topic number one today is in videos
greenlight I'd love to see on on Twitter
or on the chat on twitch who here is
familiar with what greenlight refers to
okay Oscar says Venezuela says hi that's
cool Oscar hi to Venezuela as well okay
Jason says hey Linus you're live is the
speed of your rabbit important to
overclocking no generally speaking not
really it's um it's less of a factor now
that we have unlocked processor so Ram
didn't matter back in the day when
he had unlocked multipliers and then Ram
mattered a lot in the in the socket for
78 days Ram was everything getting high
performance high frequency round was the
only way you were gonna get the maximum
overclock out of your CPU and then both
Intel AMD now have unlocked processors
so you actually don't even need to
adjust your Ram speed in order to get
whatever overclocking you want Adrian
wants to know how I know Logan honestly
I don't really know Logan I've never met
him in person just we've exchanged
tweets and emails and YouTube private
messages over the last sort of while
here that's that's about it we only
really know each other through like like
the YouTube the YouTube Brotherhood so I
I'm late tonight Brian I am NOT late
tonight I was exactly on time I was
about as on-time as someone could ever
be for a live stream that starts when
they show up so no matter what I do no
matter what I do I'm on time so no one
I'm not familiar with green light oh
this is great green light is extremely
interesting so it started with the Fermi
architecture cards and what green light
basically is is okay let's say galaxy
for example galaxy colourful palette
actually I don't know if colorful is a
Geforce partner or whatever they're not
in North America so let's go with the
g-force partners MSI Susi VGA all of
these guys what green light means is
they create a design for a card so if
you guys aren't familiar with how an
atom board partner works basically
Nvidia designs a chipset so that's uh
that's a GK 104 for example GK 104 is
the chip that's on a 660ti it's also the
chip on a 670 a 680 and a 690 but
there's two of them so they have a
chipset then they do a reference design
where they take that chipset and they
completely design a product around it so
they'll put on a memory amount of memory
and they'll put like a suggested memory
ram speed frequency timings they'll
design like a power delivery system and
they'll make a PCB for it they'll do a
cooler that is a reference card so it's
actually designed in every possible way
by Nvidia although Nvidia manufacturers
nothing Nvidia's chips themselves are
manufactured by a third party such as
TSMC and their cards themselves are
actually usually meant well not usually
they're always manufactured by someone
else as well so when nvidia does like a
new launch for example if they launch a
reference gtx 680 that means one of
their a didn't board partners was
probably contracted to produce all the
reference six 80s which then the other
partners have to put their sticker on
and you know they're kind of doing it as
a favor friend video so they probably
don't make a whole lot of money on it
and all of that but that's nugget
reference design oh yeah
now the Adhan board partners are more
than welcome to design their own many
aspects of the GPS so you've seen you
know EVGA with their umpteen billion
different versions of every GPU or
they've got a super clock and a super
super clock and a for the win enough for
the win plus and a super super clock
plus and a classified they've got so
many cards so some of those have
different cooling solutions some of them
have different clock speeds some of them
have different power delivery which will
enable better overclocking some of them
will have different amounts of ram so
they might be two gigs three gigs four
gigs six gigs doesn't matter these are
all the different things that the atom
board partners can do they can add
different display outputs so great
example was EVGA s 570 HD where they
actually added and this isn't a 570 but
they added a DisplayPort out which none
of the other 570s really had they were
mostly dual DVI with a mini HDMI another
example would be galaxies 570 m DT which
actually had triple display outputs on a
570 before Nvidia officially introduced
that feature with the 600 series
okay so we got reference designs then we
have adding board partner designs and
that's anything that was designed by
someone other than Nvidia and doesn't
look like that standard nvidia card okay
so green light means that Invidia it has
to approve or give the green light the
go-ahead to any design that a
manufacturer submits before it gets
released to market so what does this
mean there's a lot of different sides to
the story so I'm gonna give you guys a
little bit of the history of what's
happened to bring the green light
program to light to light green
to light recently so number one is MSI's
power edition cards their power edition
cards their hoc edition cards nvidia has
a certain spec so you know this is aside
from the cooler and the clock speed
whatever they have a certain spec for
how much voltage they want apply to the
GPU how much voltage they want to apply
to different parts of the kit that is
used to make up this graphics card where
the item board partner can design all
the other stuff and what MSI was doing
was they were allowing the GPUs to be
over volted and overclocked in a way
that Nvidia did not authorize now Tom's
Hardware did a fantastic article
actually it was the German site that I
think did the original article but
there's an English version that's sort
of shorter and and easier to read for
people who don't read German like me and
what they basically discovered was that
MSI was dramatically over volting one of
the components on this board in order to
achieve the results they were getting I
mean a 660ti power addition when maximum
overclocked could actually run right
there with a GTX 670 reference card when
they were both at their maximal
overclocks which basically means you'd
have to have rocks in your head in order
to buy a 670 reference card when this
660ti power edition was just as fast
once you overclocked it so so they
discovered that's that's what they were
doing
it was also then discovered that MSI is
revising the cards in order to adhere to
Nvidia's guidelines with respect to GPU
voltages and and the overall design of
the card to get a sort of green light it
again.now green light doesn't mean that
MSI cannot release the product you can
see they released the 660ti power
Edition even though it was not running
according to spec so what NVIDIA has
basically come out and said in the last
last day or so is that it's not a matter
of vents red lighting a product they're
not saying ok you can't release this
product to the market but what they are
saying to the Adhan board partners is if
you release this product we are
not going to warranty the components
that you bought from us so basically
they're voiding the Adhan board partners
warranty for overclocking outside of the
certain threshold that nvidia wants
overclocked another example is EVGA 680
classified that knot is no longer sold
with the evbot utility that allowed it
to be over volted ok so a couple
different ways to interpret this number
one is you could kind of go rawr rabble
rabble rabble nvidia is limiting the
board partners in terms of what they can
do in the terms of the designs they can
bring to market the performance they can
deliver to gamers so that's that's one
perspective the other perspective is
this is from Nvidia scamp is that the
greenlight program is designed to
improve the reliability and the
consistency of the experience for
GeForce GPUs for gamers so NVIDIA has an
internal philosophy that and I agree
with them a hundred percent on this that
if your video card dies after a year or
two that's not a good thing and that
that's going to create a bad customer
experience a bad experience around the
GeForce experience and NVIDIA is deeply
concerned with what kind of an
experience the customer has whether they
buy a Gallic galaxy card an EVGA card
Asus whoever it doesn't matter from
their perspective they want to make sure
no matter who the customer chooses they
get a great experience so very valuating
things on this greenlight program
they're evaluating acoustics they're
evaluating the temperatures they're
evaluating the size of the GPUs making
sure that the customer is gonna have a
great experience so from their
perspective they're kind of sitting here
going ok we did all the work on this we
understand how this chip works down to
its varied like microscopic level we've
done all the testing and determined what
is a safe voltage in terms of the heat
that it's gonna output you know whether
the cooling design can handle it or
whatever else what is a safe voltage in
terms of the longevity of the chip they
have bend the chips at their level so
remember guys a GK 104 GPU is exactly
the same GPU exactly the same thing
whether it's in a 660ti of 670 or 680 so
what is the difference the difference is
that they actually take these GPUs and
they sort them into which ones are
validated for 680 670 660ti operational
speeds as well as the number of
functional units that are enabled okay
so in videos basically okay look well we
already been these for you we told you
what voltage is safe to run the matte
from a reliability in a heat output
perspective and if you want to go ahead
and turn them up that's fine
but the onus is going to be on you to
support these things once they're out
there in the market because this is not
what we designed them to be used for so
who's right actually that's outside the
scope of this conversation but I would
love to get your comments on Twitter and
have a look at what you guys think about
the greenlight program and whether ok
you guys are just like you guys are just
not talking about this at all ok please
please outline is tech tweet that
direction tweet and let me know what do
you think of the greenlight program
whose side are you on are you with the
adding board partners who are basically
going ok well we should be able to take
this thing that we bought from you in
video we should be able to do whatever
we want with it
and you should warranty it because you
know we're your partners or do you take
the other perspective and go well Nvidia
kind of has the right to set a warranty
termini they're not telling the partners
they can't do it they're just saying
we're not going to warranty it because
you used it outside of the oven it's
like if you use your fridge to cool your
PC you're not gonna get warranty for
that it's like a consumer TV actually
consumer TV is our great example Toshiba
I believe is the only brand that will
actually warranty a consumer TV the
instant you put it into a commercial
environment so if you use a sony tv
samsung TV in your business in your
restaurant you have TV displayed you
want it up on the wall the second you
put that in there your warranty is void
because it is not valid for commercial
use
so it's not like this is an uncommon
thing ok we finally have some
interactions let's have a look at what
people say
all right doo-doo-doo-doo oh wow we've
got a lot of responses now yeah way to
go guys okay Nicholas invidious side
Ria's we're not talking about that right
now
Jourdan Nvidia is taking a stand I like
it they aren't limiting us we'd still
have both options no Jordan
something I would bring up about your
point here is that we actually don't
have both options every partner that I'm
aware of that had asked you that was not
warranty able under green light has
pulled that skew back so effectively by
pulling the warranty out of them they
have removed those options from the
market whether they're correct about it
or not is sort of the debate we're
having here but we don't really have a
choice anymore so they're something to
bear in mind
Nvidia is correct Nvidia Nvidia Nvidia
are in the right here Ryan says what's
going to happen to the existing 660ti so
well for the power addition from MSI
which is the example I focused on a lot
here any that were already released are
going to be what they are
and so they'll perform a little better
and then the new ones that are
redesigned will be under the same name
they'll be the same SKU and they'll have
slightly less overclocking potential you
won't be able to crank up the voltage as
much and that will be that okay fax says
NVIDIA has the right to control their
warranty Alex I'm with NVIDIA they
shouldn't have to warranty something
that's not designed for so it looks like
by and large you guys are both are all
very much on the green light Nvidia side
which is very interesting because a lot
of the time consumers and I'm not going
to generalize you guys hear anything
like that but a lot of the time
consumers are not very quick to side
with sort of the multi-billion dollar
international company in this case I can
see it from both perspectives because
what Nvidia is effectively done is
they've taken something the GPU partners
have always taken for granted they've
always been able to do this before and
it's always been one of the ways that
they can compete against each other
because it's not like Nvidia supports
every partner equally I mean they try to
do their best but it's like no if you
have like ten children there's bound to
be one that's your favorite or whatever
else
so one of the ways that the GPU partners
could use to differentiate from each
other has has been taken away so I can
see why particularly some of the
partners that relied on this would be
really upset it's like um should your
kids have an ice cream every Saturday
you know what it there's nothing wrong
with giving them an ice cream every
Saturday if they're being good are the
kids are the kids wrong when they say
well we're still being good and the
expectation was always that if we were
really good we were gonna get ice cream
on Saturday and now you're saying no ice
cream anymore I don't know I don't know
I don't have I don't have my dancer here
but uh okay invidious side and videos on
the right Matthew so say my name that's
creepy dude creepy creepy creepy oh wait
you didn't mean it like that all right
what else we got here so we've got about
another 65 results which means I can't
read all of them but I am gonna do a
quick skim here once I get down to whoa
we have a lot of lot of tweets here
Matthew something something I don't know
whatever let's just look at them
possibility change motherboard is it
gonna be descending videos correct in
videos correct oh I think I actually
went past it there we go
on invidious side as the partner doesn't
want to crank up the cards Scotty Scotty
you the first one decide with the
partners here
I'm with the partners because they
produce brilliant coolers and it just
improves the cards performance you're
right it does improve the cards
performance so here's an interesting
take on it this was um I forget who
brought this up but a EVGA 'z 680 was
originally permitted to operate this way
and then now they're not able to ship it
with evbot anymore so effectively in
videos created this environment where
SKUs that don't really exist anymore
okay so the power Edition as we know it
for 660ti doesn't exist the 680
classified with all the over voltage
doesn't exist but SKUs that no longer
exist have been used to set overclocking
records and set an unrealistic
expectation with customers did they do
this intentionally did they not I
actually don't know
and they asked the right to limit their
warranty I'm on the nvidia side I think
the greenlight program is great and I'm
all for a good customer experience you
know what that is that is one huge way
to to look at this is that if nvidia is
effectively improving the reliability
and the GeForce experience then how can
we see it as a bad thing hard to say I
mean what if what if the partners
basically said to you guys here we'll
give you a bios that you know if you
register your card we'll give you a BIOS
that unlocks all of the over-voltage
options and you will you'll forfeit your
warranty would you guys do something
like that I mean that might be the
solution to all of this MSI continues
producing the power edition exactly the
same way that they always have and then
they just kind of go okay well you know
we're gonna ship it like this with this
BIOS that limits all this stuff so we
can maintain our warranty and then we'll
give customers the option to and I don't
know how they'd track it to be perfectly
honest I mean it is all hypothetical but
we'll give customers the option to
forfeit the warranty that way it's not
on MSI's head what the customer decides
to do with that card and NVIDIA won't
have to deal with it either that way
you're just taking responsibility for
your own your own overclocking
adventures which is how it used to be
actually I mean overclocking used to
avoid everyone's warranty back in the
day so okay you have a similar process
AMD I think is pretty much they they let
the partners do what they want at this
point I mean you look at something like
the devil 13 7990 from power color I
mean that's a very elaborate design that
went into that card and they also yeah
they've released it power color managed
to release it so I'm with Nvidia not
warranting misuse I'll take Nvidia side
I want to look for anyone else who's
who's on the who's on the partner side
here I think we only had one person side
with the partners through all of this
and videos oh here we go here we go
Mikael says I think I'm more on the
partner side because if they buy the
cards they should be able to do what to
Nvidia is right to vote okay I'm
unfortunately I don't really understand
that T tweet but Thank You Mikhail for
parts
debating okay we're gonna move on from
this topic now I see I have a ton more
tweets about this but as you guys can
clearly see it's pretty much impossible
for me to read and and and analyze all
of them but I just wanted to share this
whole situation with you get your guys's
thoughts on it I give you my thoughts on
it let's move on to the next thing
ultra books so my understanding of an
ultra book was that aside from MacBook
Air which we all know hopefully we all
know is not an ultrabook
MacBook Air is not an ultra book okay so
we're clear
because ultra book requests the word
ultra book requires an Intel license to
use it it's licensed on ask you by SKU
basis for those of you who don't know
what a SKU is a SKU refers TIFF means
stock keeping unit it's like one sort of
set specification of a particular in
this case notebook okay so it's on ask
you by SKU basis there's no charge from
Intel to validate a notebook the only
charge involved is you take your
notebook we're gonna pretend this is no
but this is gonna be my prop for the
rest of the night no matter what I'm
talking about so you take your notebook
you stop a shipping label on it you send
it to Intel and they analyze it they
look at it in a bunch of different ways
and sort of then they either give you
the okay yes this is an ultrabook
or they say no go back to the drawing
board you have to fix this and this and
this and it is not an ultrabook yet send
it back again when it's done and so
anyway so Apple does not participate in
that program so MacBook Air in spite of
its similarity to something like an Asus
Zenbook is not an ultrabook
okay so I would love to see some tweets
here guys
about what you think are the
characteristics of an ultrabook
so we're gonna go back to we're going to
go back to the Twitter feed here 36 new
interactions of course of course there
are 36 new interactions you guys are you
guys are crazy you guys are awesome
honestly in the last week I've gained
about 4,000 followers on Twitter which
is which is outstanding and I'm sure not
all of you were just in it for the
graphics card giveaway I'm sure most of
you were in it so you could
participate in the live streams and send
me messages and all that kind of good
stuff
that's what most of you were up to all
right let's see anyone got it up
ultrabooks sock yeah okay ultra ebooks
are cool however all right here we go
here we go
so let's get into what people think of
this whole ultra book thing Zach says
ultra ebooks are cool but I would much
rather get a more substantial
customizable laptop my response to Zach
is this is the direction things are
heading then whether we like it or not
Apple has set this trend with MacBook
Pro MacBook and MacBook Air that that's
the direction notebooks are going I mean
look at something like the razor blade
if that's not like an Apple aluminum
unibody sort of inspired design then I
don't know what is you look at Asus
Zenbook if that's not a MacBook Air
inspired design and I don't know what is
but anyway moving right along
so Joseph Ben you're right thinnest part
of it um other books overpriced
sliminess st ah Nicholas okay so slim
yes SSD not necessarily but I'll get
into that in more detail later Joel says
good quality good quality can be
quantified in a lot of different ways um
so again don't worry guys I'm gonna talk
about this I'm gonna talk about this
okay high battery life says Jordan fast
small and lights as Derek ultrabooks our
Intel laptops that are thin and light
and good battery life Joe I love your
picture this is the second time I've
seen you on the Twitter feed I still
need to know if that's actually you
though because that's that's amazing
that burger is well it's literally the
size of a man's head okay battery life
and thinness until I seriously psst
integrated graphics ultrabooks suck not
enough power
okay Dom we're sorry 60 new interactions
okay okay I'm just gonna take these 60
if you guys do want to participate in
the whole like Twitter thing I need you
guys to like be on the ball on your
tweets because I can only read so many
of them it's a little powerful battery
life size and weight okay I'm looking
for a few different things here guys
that I'm not seeing yet because there's
way more to Ultrabook than I actually
understood myself but the we had one of
Intel's field guys in today and he
explained all the different aspects of
things that Austin
Austin you can watch the livestream
after on the YouTube channel so I can't
I can't I can't redo the whole thing
just for you
ultra books are nice I wouldn't buy one
so yeah he explained all the different
stuff that goes into it none of you are
getting it which is which is awesome
because I feel a little bit better about
me not knowing what an ultra book was
about okay so number one then then then
form factor form factor is huge so
depending on the screen size the
diagonal screen size intel has different
specs for how thick an ultrabook is
allowed to be to still be an ultrabook
okay so if you have a bigger screen size
you're allowed a little bit more
thickness and it can still be an
ultrabook
okay battery life honestly until isn't
too stringent on battery life the
requirement is 5 hours and that's that
means five hours of like real 5 hours
not like five hours of like you put it
in hibernate and you try not to like go
too close to it and it'll last for five
hours you know five hours with Wi-Fi
with using the computer of actual
general usage and intel validates this
stuff okay
however the sort of the recommended what
we're seeing more commonly is closer to
around eight hours which is fantastic i
mean eight hours is long enough that you
can realistically use the computer and
sort of an all-day type environment as
long as you're putting it to sleep
whenever you're not using it and then
waking up when you are using it
aha which leads us to another spec so a
lot of you suggested that an SSD is a
necessary part of the Ultrabook spec it
is not an SSD is a great way to meet the
Ultrabook spec because it'll mean that
you can have a thinner form factor if
you're using like an M SATA SSD it'll
mean that your power consumption will be
really low it'll run really cool it will
also enable fast wake from sleep times
and overall snappy performance so intel
has a spec that says it can take no
longer than seven seconds for an
ultrabook to wake from sleep now when
his name's Ben we're gonna have a couple
episodes on the NCIX comm channel
featuring him in the next next week or
two so Ben point it out to me that with
an SSD an ultrabook can typically and oh
yeah boot boot times are are probably
looked at as
although it wasn't on the list of things
that are and analyzed so the UEFI BIOS
went very quickly the first time we
booted it up and it booted up extremely
quickly then when we put it to sleep and
opened it up it took less than two
steamboats less than two seconds to be
fully functional when it was coming up
from sleep so an SSD enables that
however an SSD isn't the only way to do
it you are allowed as a laptop
manufacturer to implement a hybrid
solution such as a hard drive with an
SSD cache the SSD cache has to be at
least 16 gigs and with that hybrid
solution you can honestly with the hard
drive
you would just wouldn't be able to meet
the spec Intel doesn't explicitly say
you can't use a plain hard drive but
what they do say is you have to adhere
to this performance standard which rules
out hard drives so with a hybrid drive
you can meet that spec while not having
the added extra expense of going with a
straight SSD solution so something like
a momentous XT or a separate 16 gig on
an M SATA with a separate mechanical
hard drive running in the shell these
are solutions that the partners can
implement so ok so there's a performance
aspect it has to use a third generation
Core i3 i5 or i7 processor I personally
I wouldn't mind if they locked it down
to just i5 and i7 I mean at the point
where you're looking at low power i3 s
they're not they're not going to deliver
that that snappiness about performance
connectivity an ultrabook must have a
high-speed connectivity now until
doesn't specify what that is but in
practical terms it must have a USB 3
port and it or or sorry or it must have
a thunderbolt port or both it has to
have at least one though what are the
other things with respect to
connectivity is that I believe business
class ultrabooks must have an Ethernet
port they can't rely solely on Wi-Fi now
all ultrabooks do have to have Wi-Fi
which makes sense because none of them
really have optical drives and if you
had no Wi-Fi and this Ultrabook display
portable device that actually you have
to plug in every time you use it that
would be stupid
but that's an aside at this point moving
along to some of the other things
ultrabooks must have right they must
have Intel's identity protection
technology and they must have Intel's
anti-theft technology you know we did a
really cool tech tips about Intel
anti-theft technology and I'm gonna give
you guys I'm actually gonna give those
of you who are who are subscribed to or
not subscribe see I'm so used to being
like a youtuber those of you who are
following me on Twitter I am going to
explain one of the most cryptic things
that I have ever uploaded to the
internet ever today so this was an image
that I that I uploaded today and this is
the crazy Russian for those of you who
asked if that's like of course it isn't
slick it's the Russian look how Russian
he looks so that's him drawing an evil
mustache on yours truly so the episode
we shot today was really cool because we
we had me steal Ben's ultra book yet I
steal I mean I didn't keep it you know
although maybe I should actually I
couldn't know because I stole it I went
to a nearby Starbucks where I could get
on the Wi-Fi and then I gave him a call
and we did kind of like a fake thing
like it was kind of fun you're like a
big I stole your ultra book and I'm
going to log into your Facebook and I'm
gonna message your grandmother and um
and so Ben was like mol no - I'm gonna
use my anti-theft technology which is
built into the Ultrabook at a pre BIOS
level so there's like there's like
hardware and then there's like like bare
metal firmware then there's BIOS which
is programmable you can erase and and
reflash it then there's your OS okay so
it's built in at this level and what he
was able to do and the subscription to
McAfee service I think cost like 60
bucks a year or something like that what
he was able to do is he was able to tell
his ultrabook you can tell it a couple
things you can tell it if you go too
long without an internet connection shut
off and lock you can also tell it next
time you have network connectivity shut
off lock you can't get around this three
formatting the OS will not help
reflashing the BIOS will not help once
it's locked so once he locked it and I
was sitting there I was able to show the
screen to the camera and go okay there's
a message from Ben
this has been please return my laptop
and you cannot boot the notebook no
matter what you do which is very very
cool
so that is required as part of the
ultrabooks back every ultra book must
have that feature so if you pay for the
service then you'll be able to we were
even able to see where the ultra book
was within about a couple block radius
just using just using the IP address
that it was that it that was registered
to it when it was uh it was on the Wi-Fi
so very very very cool stuff I'm just
gonna see if there's anything else that
I'm forgetting about the whole ultra
book concept I don't think so I can see
if there's any more any more tweets
about ultra book and of course there's
probably like 1 billion oh ok change the
ultra book topic ok I'm sorry
I'm sorry the ultra book topic isn't
interesting for you something about
Gangnam style okay we're not talking
about that okay you guys aren't
interested in ultra book fine be like
that fine
fine we'll move on to a new topic ok so
my next actually you know what let's do
it let's do a short Q&amp;amp;A and then I'll
move on to move on to my next topic so
I'm just gonna look for some of the
stuff Dom why do retail shops say one or
two gig graphics and not the specs of
the cart because retail shops you know
big-box retail guys who rely on the
ignorance of their customers to make
additional margin don't want to tell you
any specs that will be helpful because
from their perspective like ok this is a
2gig graphics card so from their
perspective would they rather sell you
so this this cost like 300 bucks
ok so would they rather convince you
that the cheapo graphics card that they
have you know like let's say a GT 640 or
something but they want to charge 150
bucks for would they rather convince you
that that 2 gig card is as good as any
other 2 gig card absolutely and because
the customers walking into these places
don't have the knowledge and the
experience to know that the GPU the
memory bus the amount of remember the
speed of the memory in a type of a
memory all of these things are way way
more important than the amount of memory
on a video card in fact for any low-end
to mid-range
card the amount of memory is actually
almost totally meaningless because it
doesn't have the GPU horsepower to back
up that memory anyway so with that 2gig
frame I mean okay you could take a GT
640 you could put a four gig frame
buffer on it there's no reason you
couldn't do it that card could
potentially hold enough texture data in
its frame buffer to power like a six
monitor gaming setup but that GPU would
only be able to run that set up at one
frame per second so who cares can have
all the memory at once it's totally
irrelevant because it will be
bottlenecked by the GPU power long
before the memory amount even matters
640 could be a 512 Meg card it wouldn't
even matter and the same thing goes for
even high-end cards as well so something
like a 660ti unless you're running
surround you don't need more than 2 gigs
if you are running surround all of a
sudden more memory starts to matter
because it has the GPU horsepower to
back it up so it all comes down to
resolution as well as how demanding the
textures of the game are if you're
running high res texture packs now we're
talking about a completely different
thing where memory could be the
difference between chugging along at 10
FPS because it has to swap out to the
system memory all the time and running
at a smooth 30 40 FPS so there hopefully
that addresses the topic of GPU memory
once and for all
let's go ahead and have a look at some
of the newer tweets that came in once
all 81 81 tweets okay
so let's have a look at some of the
people who tweeted sort of first here so
these are two minutes does that mean you
could also hack into the anti-theft
thing to lock up someone's computer I
guess in theory I don't know but that's
actually been done yet alex is in a good
mood
cool story Alex building a web cam ultra
an ultrabook with AMD CPUs would be
great for portable gaming fantastic
point Alex Wagner so I don't know if you
guys saw my episode about amd's art
rather two episodes on my NCIX tech tips
channel about AMD's AP use so what we
discovered is that as a cpu with
dedicated graphics yeah it's semi
competitive with core i3 like it does ok
ok it does ok but it's not winning any
awards
however you
you're using the onboard graphics it
wipes the floor with not only a core i3
but a core i5 core i7 doesn't matter if
you talk on board graphics versus
onboard graphics apu destroys intel so
an ultrabook with APU graphics would
actually be fantastic for ultra portable
gaming I am super excited though to see
what Intel's Haswell brings to the table
because Haswell is going to be very
power efficient and they are going to be
dramatically boosting up the performance
of the GPU Derek says thank you for
saying my name you're welcome again
Derek David says I'd prefer GPS me too
but it costs more to implement so what
do you want me to say I'm sure that they
could do it with GPS it's just that's
not the requirement yet Troy - how can I
stop my Galaxy S from discharging when
I'm charging it and using it could I buy
a different battery please Troy the only
thing I can tell you is I get maybe a
higher powered USB port if that's what
you're charging it off of there are some
motherboards that have like super
powered like 3x powered USB ports
that'll charge things faster just make
sure you don't totally exceed the amount
of current that's supposed to be used to
charge that join Linus fan club what is
this - fan club that is a bizarre thing
sir I will create a facebook profile at
some point but yeah I don't I don't
necessarily think I need a fan club per
se that's an awesome security feature
what are your thoughts on sleek book
haven't heard of sleek book
unfortunately what is the hot but dupa
dupa do would you see improved what do
you think Kyle what's your favorite junk
food my favorite junk food Lindor
chocolates
I love Lindor chocolates on the total
girl when it comes to Lindor chocolates
rephrase says did you know that raising
a baby costs eighty thousand dollars
okay
I mean that's sort of an arbitrary
number especially because anyone
starting raising a baby now we'll still
be raising a baby
eighteen years from now which means that
those numbers will be totally irrelevant
because of inflation and whatever else
but yeah that's cool
okay uh Michael VAR pls pls for sure so
pls is actually closer in terms of the
technology to IPS than it is to a PBA or
MBA however I was just made aware today
on the new VA it's gonna be called H a
VA or something like that you know what
I'm gonna have to look this up but uh
little dot CA
H AV a panel no that might not be it
BenQ a VA h VA shoot I'm boned I can't
figure it out so so Ben Q has a new
monitor coming that's using a new panel
type that is not a pls it's not an IPS
but it's similar in technology and
they're super excited it's gonna have a
hundred percent srgb color gamut it's
going to have one 78 degree viewing
angle so the spec looks very similar to
what can be achieved with pls but right
now based on what's actually available
at this moment I'm a huge pls guy I love
POS Cullen don't worry nothing happens
to your warranty and 660ti power edition
nothing happens and the side will still
deal with it okay when can we expect
something something what do you think of
okay Yi wants to know what do you think
of the future of LGA 2011 after ivy
bridge-e will a new socket be introduced
for haswell-e right now I don't think
anyone knows for those of you who don't
have the context for this question LGA
2011 is now two generations behind LGA
1155 in terms of the cpu architecture it
is still using sandy bridge-e for I
don't know enthusiasts workstation
whatever Eastern's for so Sandy Bridge
has been waiting pulled on Sandy Bridge
no no sorry it's one generation behind
and once Haswell launches on LGA 1155 it
will be two generations behind so by the
time it gets our refresh it'll be two
behind so what does that mean so it
means that in terms of instruction per
clock it is behind so single threaded
performance is actually lower on LGA
2011 and it is on 1155 in spite of 2011
being the enthusiast platform
or enthusiasts happy about this I don't
know personally as a 2011 user I wish I
had an Ivy Bridge processor to drop in
my system I wish that I you know had
haswell-e to go into my system so that's
the disadvantage of 2011 is we seem to
be getting a bit of a short straw in
terms of upgrades however the advantage
of 2011 is that it's getting a much more
advanced so much more robust overall
architecture so 2011 when Ivy Bridge
gets its refresh so right now okay so we
had Sandy Bridge and sandy bridge-e LGA
2011 LGA 1155 then we got Ivy Bridge
then on 11:55 this is 11:55 we're gonna
get Haswell so until we'll have gone
through two architectural changes then
we're gonna get ivy bridge-e which will
be sort of caught up but still a
generation behind however LGA 1155 will
not have more than four course intel's
already said this they won't get more
than four course 2011 already has six
course if you're like me you render a
lot of video six cores there's actually
more important than a few more
instructions per clock okay so once we
get say ah once we get ivy bridge-e
we're gonna get anywhere from 10 to 12
cores and these will be high performance
course because there's no need to have a
GPU core built in as for what happens in
the future I hope we'll get as well but
honestly I kind of doubt it however
looking back at LGA 1366
so remember 1366 lasted throughout part
of 775 you know some time five was still
there on the low end when 1366 was a
premium platform lasted through 1156 and
was still relevant once we moved to 1155
if I recall correctly although I could
be getting that mixed either way 1366
lessons from multiple mainstream sockets
and there's no reason to believe that
LGA 2011 won't last through multiple
mainstream sockets it's got all those
pins
worst case scenario they might do a
chipset refresh or something like that
but they probably won't change the
socket and I guess basically I don't
really know nick says can i have a shout
out please
okay Nick you are shouted Ria's once no
can you please tell me what should be
the maximum temperature for overclocking
a video card Ria's there isn't really a
maximum temperature it depends on the
card so unfortunately it's one of those
questions that I know you've tweeted
this at me a few times but I don't
really have an answer most modern cards
are good up to 90 95 degrees and they're
actually designed to run like that
however you can see what in television
do you've been doing with the last
couple of generations improving the
power efficiency and improving the
temperatures that they're probably not
trying to have their GPUs run so hot
anymore
thank you Matt I'm doing well and I hope
you are doing well as well ah yes Amir
great question this is one of the other
topics that I wanted to launch into so
we're gonna go ahead and do that now why
is Quad SLI a terrible idea for a gaming
machine and I should clarify I'm a Mears
question is actually not as terrible so
he wants to know would you recommend two
gtx 690 sr 4 gtx 680 s for extreme
benchmarking easy answer for gtx 680 s
the reason for that is they overclock
better than 690 s although that's not as
true anymore so you have to find ones
that over bolt along the lines of that
green light topic we were talking about
earlier and just the fact that in terms
of thermals you will be less limited
because you can use better cooling on
them by having them separated
now forget extreme benchmarking I have a
lot of people asked me about anything
beyond two-way SLI so 3-way SLI four-way
SLI they'll say hey is this a good deal
a good idea should I get should I get
dual 690 s should I get should I get
quad 680 S or triple six 80s or else and
whatever else okay so a few things so
number one power consumption is going to
go through the roof number two the
actual officially actual performance you
gain I did a great video about this the
actual performance you gained from 3-way
SLI oh shoot there we go
three dash way SLI - let's try switching
for that here so the actual performance
you gain from through SLI from two-way
SLI is actually very small you guys
should check out this video that I did a
while back so this was GT
690 versus 3-way 670 and yeah you should
definitely check that out it's it's kind
of an analysis of the scaling of these
GPUs as well you don't get much in terms
of performance now if you go okay Linus
I don't care
money is no object for me it doesn't
matter I am willing to blow this money
on these GPUs I want to have a great
gaming experience I want the maximum FPS
to which I would reply wrong you're
wrong that's not what you want you do
not just want maximum FPS there is more
to gaming there is more to a high-end
system than throwing more graphics cards
into it so I see people and dual six 90s
I guess is less ridiculous than triple
and quadruple cards for this reason
we've only got 7 expansion slots on even
your highest end board something like an
asrock extreme 11 where they actually
manage to implement seven slots on the
2011 board
that's your best-case scenario if you
install three graphics cards nevermind
for where there will be absolutely no
slots left if you install three graphics
cards on most motherboards you'll have
no slots left over you'll have like a
PCI slot or something stupid due to the
way that they do the slot else if you
have for graphics parts you'll have none
so let's assume you have none where's
your sound card where is your raid card
where is your anything your HDMI capture
card for streaming your gaming or you
get your forecasting or whatever else
most importantly where is your sound
card anyone who thinks that sound is not
an important aspect of gaming and is
willing to compromise on the sound
experience use their onboard sound
instead of at or is willing to use that
for the pleasure of putting in another
graphics card to get another 10% 15%
maybe 20% performance improvement is
just wrong you're wrong because a huge
part of a cinematic experience whether
it's movies or games a huge part of your
immersion is the sound experience why do
you enjoy the movie theater why did you
I mean let's okay not even today we're
we've got digital production and great
screens and most movie theaters let's go
back 10 years ago when most movie
theaters had like little pops and
circles and sort of artifacts all over
the screen were you going there to see
the movie big yes were you going there
to see the movie on like this pristine
crystal-clear screen no you were going
there to get absolutely rocked by there
20.2 surround system with huge
subwoofers because it makes for a more
immersive experience there is more to
life than more graphics cards and more
gamers need to realize this I've
actually made a point of retweeting some
of the tweets people have sent me - you
talked me into buying a sound card holy
crap I can't believe I ever listened to
those people who said that a sound card
doesn't make a difference
get a real sound card get a proper
headset get proper speakers you will
thank me do not buy more graphics cards
- graphics cards is pretty much enough
here's another reason so people might
respond to me - I need more graphics
cards because I'm gonna run 6 monitors
or I'm gonna run I'm gonna run 3 super
high resolution displays wrong again the
reason for that is that in SLI the
graphics cards actually don't build on
each other's memory if you have 2 2 gig
graphics cards you have 2 gigs of beer
in effectively if you have 2 3 gig
graphics cards you have 3 gigs of
graphics memory that is actually usable
by your system if you have 4 3 gig
graphics cards I know I'm emphasizing
this a lot you have 3 gigs of
addressable graphics memory which means
that by the time you got to a resolution
that would benefit from all these
additional graphics cards in any
meaningful way you're gonna run out of
VRAM Oh which brings me back to actually
680 Quad SLI vs. 690 SLI so that's right
that's why 6 now I forgot frame so 680
Quad SLI or triple SLI is terrible
because you lose all of your
expandability for your system fantastic
and then Quad SLI with 6 90s is terrible
because you have a 2 gig frame buffer
way to go with your 2gig frame buffer
which is not useful for anything higher
than about 2560 by 1600
single display you're not going to be
using a 2gig frame buffer to get an
optimal experience on triple displays
you'd probably be better off going with
like dual six seven all right like dual
660ti three gigs or something like that
actually no that's probably not fair I
mean dual 684 gigs or something along
those lines may actually be a better
solution than two six 90s because of the
limited VM so there that's my lecture on
triple SLI Quad SLI and all those kinds
of solutions that for 99.9% of people
who aren't trying to do what whoopsie
daisies where's my where's my Twitter
there we go who aren't trying to do what
Amir's talking about where you're just
trying to set a benchmark record it
doesn't make sense alright so now that
I've done another topic why don't we do
a little bit more what I'm gonna do a
little bit more conversation Siddarth I
actually don't know a mechanical
keyboard with blue or brown switches
that has a backlight I think ducky might
have something but it's nothing that
I've done I've ever actually used so I'm
sorry I got nothing i got nothing huh
this is funny alex great suggestion
actually this is planned
Alex writes in can't you do a giveaway
where we have to make a nerd rage video
and you judge them and pick the best one
I haven't announced this in any way so
this live stream will be the first time
anyone's hearing about this but Corsair
is actually sponsoring a contest I'm
gonna have 5k 90 keyboards so these are
like hundred plus dollar mechanical
keyboards backlights macros the whole
works
Carey red switches I'm gonna have five
of them to give away to the five best
nerd rage videos however don't start
working on your video now I can't
emphasize this enough I'm going to have
rules and requirements there have been
fantastic videos that have been
submitted for my video response contests
in the past that have been disqualified
because they didn't listen to the
requirements okay you're gonna have to
pay special close attention to what will
be the judging requirements and I don't
want to hear any complaining if you
don't win because you didn't participate
correctly however that giveaway is come
probably I'll have a video up sometime
in the next couple weeks so that's
that's very exciting
um CW any faults about the Nexus 7 Nexus
7 is a fantastic value have you guys
heard about the price drop that's coming
it's gonna be $1.99 for the 16 gig and
they're introducing a 32 game holy crap
like it makes it like the best value
ever it has a Tegra 3 processor which is
actually fast unlike well peg or two
let's know if that fast GPU wise it was
pretty good but CPU is honestly my
Galaxy Tab 10.1 is kind of not not
generating a great user experience for
me these days
Thank You Caleb his his name was big
something else we got here do I get a
lot of questions about this what power
supply would you recommend this is sort
of a general question so I'm gonna
answer Dale specific question when I'm
SSL eyeing gtx 660ti is i have 3 200
millimeter fans and maybe of course rh
100 or 150 dale you haven't given me
nearly enough information if I'd read
your entire tweet before I started
reading it out loud I probably wouldn't
have responded to this question because
the information you're giving me is
totally useless I know you have to 660ti
s which means you need at least a 700
750 watt power supply however you
haven't told me what CPU you have you
haven't told me well anything else like
are you running 10 hard drives in here
are you gonna have a whole bunch of
different power and peripherals running
off the back of the USB are you going to
have are you gonna be overclocking fans
consume like nothing people who tell me
like who asked me what power supply do I
need and they tell me all the fans
they're running in their system I'm like
all those fans maybe like 2 watts out of
your power supply totally irrelevant
totally doesn't matter and same thing
with a course RH 100 it doesn't really
consume a significant amount of power so
shout out to sofa America
I almost said South Africa shout out to
that too but you know um he soo says why
do people mistake dear phones for
headphones and vice versa I just wanted
to get that point out there because it's
annoying
ok he's soo 272 new interactions you
guys are killing me here you know what
I'm gonna actually I'm gonna launch into
a new topic here
because 272 interactions is a fantastic
point so we are gonna run through the
math of why I cannot reply to every
Twitter message I get since I started
running the contest I have received more
than 1,000 Twitter messages per day
Twitter actually has a hard limit of
1,000 tweets that I can send out per day
so that means if I sat there and typed
at my computer and literally replied to
a thousand messages I would actually get
my account like I've run into it a few
times in the last week they will just
say you have reached your tweet limit
you cannot tweet anymore okay aside from
that they split up that thousand tweet
limit into time chunks throughout the
day so you can only do like a hundred at
a time and you have to spread it out
through the day so I don't even have the
option of like lying in bed with my
laptop and typing like this or sitting
down and like hammering them away and
trying to get caught up because
Twitter's gonna get after me after I do
a hundred tweets or so and say hey oh no
it's okay wait a few hours and then you
can tweet somewhere so for those of you
who are who are upset that I wasn't able
to reply to you or you're tweeting me
and I'm not responding to you you know
what I'm gonna do my best that's all I
can do when I have some time I'm gonna
fire up my phone I'm gonna fire my
laptop I'm gonna I'm gonna hammer out
some tweets but beyond that there's just
nothing I can do the sheer volume of
messages I receive like guys think about
this okay go and read a tweet and then
like reply to it and then time yourself
now times a thousand every day I have a
full-time job I have these videos I have
a live stream when I do a live stream
it's gonna completely wipe out my place
where I was and it's going to absolutely
destroy any progress I could have
possibly made at catching up because in
this live stream alone I've already
received well over 600 tweets so I'm
sorry guys
I do my best it's all I can do it is not
mathematically possible for me to reply
to the tweets and that doesn't even get
into the point that once I reply to a
tweet that person usually tweets me back
which means that what was a thousand
tweets once I reply to them is probably
gonna turn into more like 1500 once I
have to reply a second time and then
maybe even let's say half of those
people again reply to me again so now
every thousand tweets is actually
probably more like 1,700 tweets by the
time I'm actually done addressing the
person's question so this is why I think
I need a forum this is why I think I
need a way for you guys to interact with
each other and not just me because I
will die
speaking of which Twitter I mean if you
guys want to sort of find anything at
Linus tack and throw in your own answers
that would be great that would actually
be immensely helpful for me because I
can't reply to them all on my own all
right what else we got here tell you the
boss says hey Linus how come you haven't
posted a pic of your kids sitting in
front of a PC yet I actually have taken
one but you're right I haven't posted
one yet I'll see if I can find it I'm
not sure if I know where it is cuz my
wife keeps track of all the baby
pictures and all that Neuer says what do
you think of a gtx 660 cuz i'm trying to
build a gaming machine that isn't that
expensive gtx 660 is a good option so is
7870 you should look into both of those
i'm mix as I saw the a soos VG 2 you
know what I'm not gonna read the tweet
so I'm just gonna do this why am I doing
this
anything looks great what program does
Diesel use beezly uses Adobe cs6 so
everything you saw done previously by
myself or by Slick was done using Vegas
movie studio or whatever the cheap $100
option is because I'm super cheap so
he's using a real editing software that
he he brought his own copy of and that
is one of the reasons that the NCIX tech
tips episodes have had a higher standard
of quality he's all he'll cinders how to
use After Effects which is like voodoo
magic to me so Phil great question
there's really that nothing that's
special about a 39 60 X compared to a
3930k it used to be that the extreme
edition was somewhat justifiable because
it was unlocked so you could break
benchmarking records and if you'd like
really wanted sort of the the e-peen of
having an Extreme Edition and that was
cool but a 3930k has a little bit less
cash a little bit lower stop clock speed
and other than that it actually
overclocks
exactly the same so we're talking
performance within like 1% 2% of each
other once you overclocked them both to
the max so I've never recommended a 30
960 X to anyone people do buy them I
mean
by them it's sort of its coup yeah I
mean go for it
you want to be extreme by extreme
edition but yeah it's not something that
I've ever really recommended ah can you
talk about micro stuttering you know
what I can't talk about my christelle
ring I don't see it um micro stuttering
is one of those things that bothers all
some people a lot more than it bothers
other people it's like motion blur
motion blur drives me nuts on monitors
lots of people can't see it at all so
Eric if I had to would I rather fight
one horse-sized duck or a hundred
duck-sized horses I think I could take
the horses because I'm a lot taller than
them and if they're the size of a duck I
mean all they'd really be able to do is
kick me in the ankles I've actually been
kicked by a horse before and before the
obvious joke that explains a lot
table slapping you know that's a nice
lap and joke right there uh before you
make that joke it was a baby horse well
not a baby she's a couple months old but
my family we lived in the boondocks and
we had we had ostriches and pigs and
horses and all kinds of crazy stuff but
we had a baby horse so so one of our
horses we we bred her and she her baby's
name was Trixie and Trixie and I had a
little disagreement once about whether
she was gonna walk with me or whether
she was not gonna walk with me and she
was gonna go off on her and do her own
thing so I gave her though I gave her
the business if you guys have horses you
know you give them a little you pull
down on their on their halter you kind
of go look no you get them to bring
their head down the head down is a
submissive posture for a horse so you're
forcing them a little bit okay no look
you're gonna be submissive it doesn't
matter what you think about this so when
they put their heads up you know in rear
up that's that's aggressive okay so she
surprised me and she pulled away really
quickly and then she started doing that
whole like bucking bronco like up and
down and up and down thing and she was
you know going up on her front legs and
kicking her back legs out behind her and
she actually nailed me right in the head
so uh she got me right about here and
there's unlucky unlucky there's no scar
cuz it did bleed she got me pretty good
I actually this is one of the two times
in my life that I have that I have seen
my entire vision just like I'm gonna
simulate it I've seen my vision just
start to okay wow look this thing
whatever it starts to go wow this thing
gets light even if I cover it completely
okay whatever that's the only two times
in my life that my vision has actually
gone okay come on focus focus focus you
got this but man that my vision has gone
black so one of them was when I had
blood drawn for me when I was super
super sick and I just felt passed out on
top of the nurse and accidentally of
course and then the other time was when
I got kicked by this horse well what
happened was I was like I was standing
on my feet she kicked me in the head I
blacked out and then I came to in time
to hit the ground and luckily I wasn't
hurt but man was I ever mad so basically
she got the old you know grab her again
no pull down gave her the old smack them
smack on the butt no you're not allowed
to do that she seemed sort of genuinely
sorry about it but you can never tell
the horses they're a they're a crafty
Bunch
so yeah that's uh that's that's my story
about fighting horses and the time that
I got got kicked in the head by a horse
Linda and someone's already asked that
sorry dude they're their lower-grade
panels so they're cheaper there you go
and err have the suggestions to use I
hear the suggestions to use Facebook
instead of Twitter in order to get
around the limit it's like guys the
point is I can't reply to a thousand
plus messages a day not so much just the
physical impossibility of it but the
fact that I just can't do it it's just
not it's just not possible
Christian I have a question why will the
number pad on my razer naga not work
there's a switch on the bottom Christian
in all likelihood you haven't switched
to the wrong thing so that would be my
guess I could be wrong though I mean
there's always the crazy thought you
could contact Razer and see if they have
any thoughts but as possible it's
defective so they'd be the best ones to
talk to you about something like that
ah mizuha wants to know what would I
recommend a sabertooth z77
or the new motherboard from the Messiah
the Big Bang mPower honestly either
there were great options so a soos backs
it up with a five-year warranty which is
cool awesome and then MSI has a three
year warranty but there had testing
every single board in an overclock
scenario so I don't know you decide
which of those two things is more
important to you and then like go for it
they're both absolutely fantastic
options alright Brandon there we go
fantastic question
when does a motherboard really affect
with an a Brandon really affect
performance
ah the answer is sort of complicated so
there's a lot of ways that a motherboard
can affect performance so in terms of
the features that it delivers so a
Seuss's implementation of USB 3 for
example as far as I can tell is superior
to what I've seen from other guys you'll
get faster performance regardless of you
know which I'm gonna see if I've got one
in my pocket you know regardless of
which USB 3 device you're using or
whatever the case may be you will get
better performance from an Asus chipset
from an Asus board using their as media
chipset and there you ASPR their turbo
modes so that's one of the ways the
motherboard can affect performance
it can affect performance in terms of
just what features it has enabled so if
you want to run dual graphics SLI
crossfire
you better get a motherboard that
supports it otherwise you won't get that
performance because you can't install
those things so there's that it can
affect overclocking which means like if
you have a better power delivery system
it runs cooler you're gonna get slightly
better overclocking results BIOS
optimization is another way that the
motherboard can affect performance and
overclocking so the better they program
the BIOS the better the power delivery
is the better it is however it's not the
way it used to be it used to be back in
the socket 478 days back in the socket a
days but you could actually like
Gaming benchmarks on one motherboard
versus another motherboard and you might
see a 10% spread in terms of performance
which these days totally unheard if it
doesn't happen anymore
that's at the same speed at the same
frequency that's what I'm talking about
and that was because of the way that the
manufacturers were designing the board I
mean they were they were doing so much
more work at the BIOS level because they
had to optimize for the communication
from the FSB between this over the FSB
between the CPU and the chipset and then
from the chipset to everything else
including the RAM the second that the
integrated memory controller came along
with the Athlon 64 the second that the
memory controller was taken off the
chipset all of a sudden there was less
differentiation in terms of performance
because there was nothing that
motherboard manufacturers could really
do besides routing the traces really
cleanly to the memory banks that would
affect the way that the performance was
going to play out because it was no
longer being relayed by anything there
was no like tweaking they could do to
this chipset there's just this
integrated memory controller still right
into the CPU so there's that and I mean
even then though you know PCI Express
AGP these were features that could
differentiate boards you know better
implementations of the graphics ports
with something whereas now especially on
the Intel platform even PCI Express
Lanes are implemented at the CPU level
so what's not implemented the CPU level
now there's a few things so there's USB
3 which is on the south bridge there's
SATA which is on the South Bridge so
really anything that's built into the
CPU there's not much the motherboard
manufacturers can do about it besides
helping you tweak more overclocking
speed out of it everything else now okay
so yeah onboard graphics was another way
that motherboard manufacturers could
differentiate now that's built onto the
cpu too so really there's not there's
not a whole lot left they can build in
you know things like sass functionality
like gigabyte sent with the xix 79 SU p5
things like thunderbolt so a
connectivity more USB 3 ports better USB
3 implementations better sound
implementations such as a soos is done
with the Maximus 5 formula
these are the ways that these
motherboard guys can really
differentiate from each other
but in terms of performance you sit down
you play a game performance there's not
much of a delta anywhere um
oh dude do you have to you have to have
that twitter name it's like I hardly
even want to reply to your message but
what reason would make you end your
YouTube career um good question I guess
I haven't really thought about it I have
zero intention of stopping making videos
on YouTube if anything I feel
rejuvenated these days because it was it
was a huge milestone for me to hit that
like just huge I cannot express how
awesome it was to hit that 200,000
subscriber milestone I mean back when I
started doing this I would look at guys
with 50,000 subscribers or a hundred
thousand subscribers and I'd be like wow
that is amazing if I can ever get there
I will be so grateful and I'll be so
happy and and I and I'm there now and I
mean now I'm looking for the next I'm
looking for the next level I'm looking
for 500,000 I'm looking for a million I
mean it's always about taking it to the
next level and it was it was just really
exciting to get to one of those
milestones that I'd really set for
myself
one of the first milestones that got me
really excited was the day that time
this goes back to a Logan because he I
think he was still on the project at the
time but the day that I passed
tigerdirectblog for the number of
subscribers as well they've still got
more views by a long shot
but but it's it's it's fun it's friendly
competition I mean I have nothing
against any of those other YouTube guys
it's just it's kind of fun to play that
game so speaking of that game one of the
things that's also rejuvenated me lately
is check this out so since I hit that
200,000 subscriber mark not only has it
not slowed down so this is social blade
I know this isn't the best one did stats
axe is sort of better but this gives me
I'm just used to the interface here so
check this out guys so before I hit the
200,000 subscriber mark so you can see
here this is my total number of
subscribers in this column I was
averaging kind of 300 subscribers a day
this is an anomaly I think YouTube was
doing a correction when I hit that mark
all of a sudden whether it's people
spreading the word more whether it's you
guys support
me and you know telling your friends to
subscribe to Linus tech tips whether
it's people who just see that 200,000
number and it feels more credible to
them or whatever has happened over the
last little while I've been absolutely
overwhelmed with the additional support
on averaging more like a growth rate of
400 450 per day which is gives me all
the encouragement that I need to keep
the project going no matter no matter
what so I want to keep talking tack with
you guys I want to keep producing videos
in fact who knows maybe sometime in the
next few months you might see me even
rent things up to a completely new level
spoiler alert
stay tuned I can't give any more details
than that right now so don't even ask
what do we got let's go back to let's go
back to Twitter shall we actually you
know what no we're not gonna go back to
Twitter yeah I'm gonna have a look and
see if there's any of the other topics
that I wanted to cover so why four-way
SLI is a bad idea ah this this is
something where I actually don't have
the answer for you guys but this is the
most confusing thing in the world to me
so we're gonna go on a little voyage of
discovery here and I'm gonna talk about
what exactly is the cost structure of
displays so I'll look at I'll be back
I'll be back in like two seconds I just
have to go get something
all right so the prices of displace what
sort of prompted me to think about this
was the fact that one of my buddies
pointed out to me that he saw a 40 inch
TV that was in the neighborhood of like
400 or 450 bucks 1080p TV you know what
I'm gonna see if I can find it
1080p and then TV sorry I'm just I'm
checking on the NCIX website here this
okay so 40 inch TV I'm just gonna copy
this - okay maybe you guys can help me
figure this out because frankly I don't
get it so we're gonna switch to this
view here gonna go ahead and we're gonna
pull up a 40 inch TV okay paste okay
here's a 40 inch TV Toshiba LCD TV I can
tell you right now there's no such thing
as a TN panel TV so this is some kind of
a VA or something it's not a TN panel it
is $400 a 40 inch TV is $400 okay so why
is it that a 40 inch TV at 1080p
resolution okay bear with me here guys
isn't because it's been gonna go on sort
of a wild ride here why is it that a 40
inch TV at a 1080p resolution costs more
than a 1080p I'm breaking everything
1080p LCD v a so let's look for let's
look for a VA panel okay so here's a
27-inch that's an AMD a LED backlit okay
it's got LED backlights whatever so why
does it cost more I can tell you the
answer it's much larger okay got it so
larger costs more actually where was I
going with this
something to do with large and pixel
density and something something
something right right okay so a much
larger TV cost mark okay so now let's
let's scale things back down again and
let
look at let's look at pixel density so
when we get to pixel density all of a
sudden the smaller something is the more
it costs because it's more difficult to
manufacture so tell me something if a
bigger device that inherently has lower
pixel density and a smaller device this
monitor I showed you guys before this is
like in the same price range it's on
super discount now but generally
speaking it's a $400 so if these two
things cost the same thing in cost the
same in spite of the same resolution why
is it that this device which actually is
a 10 inch panel so in terms of the
actual size difference it's like a
similar ratio going from like a 40 inch
TV to a 27 inch LCD why is it that this
doesn't cost the same even though the
pixel density is actually significantly
higher this is also a 1080p panel if I
recall correctly this is a transformer
TF 700 so here's my question to you what
is actually affected how is it that we
can produce a 40 inch TV which is vastly
bigger for the same price as this LCD
and we can't produce you know what I had
a whole thing sort of in my mind about
this and I sort of just totally lost my
train of thought so I'm going to give up
on this topic but the point is generally
what effects it is it sighs is it pixel
density I can't quite figure it out
because it doesn't seem to it doesn't
seem like the cost scales proportionally
when we increase the size and then it
doesn't seem like the cost scales
proportionally when we decrease the pix
pixel density or increase the pixel
density or whatever else the case may be
I mean did you know that iPad Retina
display replacement IPS panels actually
only cost like a hundred bucks if you
buy them from almost like laptop repair
or screen repair or something com
I give up on this topic I'm sorry it's
actually getting kind of late and I'm
kind of tired so we're gonna move into
something else and this is something
that I really did want to talk about
Paul's hardware and awesomesauce news
are two new YouTube channels that you
guys should totally subscribe to
if you're not already subscribed to
raise the world so I'm gonna just I'm
gonna bring up all of these YouTube
channels dot here and raise the world
okay so this is one of them so this is
Logan's Channel from tech syndicate so
he is actually growing pretty fast and
things are going pretty well over there
awesomesauce
news is Kyle from that horrible horrible
store in the US so he's uh he's doing
he's doing his own sort of vlog e style
videos and then I wish him well but I
think he's only got like a hundred
subscribers or something like that see
there he is look how sexy he is okay and
then finally we have actually this one I
haven't seen what Paul's up to but
Paul's hardware is another channel that
you guys probably want to check out if
you enjoy what I'm doing then you're
probably gonna enjoy what what these
guys are doing here so Paul only has one
video he's already produced only half as
many videos as Kyle's so yeah way to go
way to go Paul I hope you're watching
Wow look at this 43 dislikes and 0
dislikes
just for that I'm gonna I'm gonna like
the video so he now has I don't know
bank share it with your friends I've
actually never liked a video on YouTube
to be perfectly honest I'm not much of a
YouTube watcher I'm just more of a
YouTube maker what other topics do we
have comedy I guess I've had a lot of
people ask me about my new gear that's
coming so if you're not familiar with my
new gear conversation I blew over 10
grand on new gear so I have an fs700
camera coming which is gonna be awesome
we'll be able to shoot video
realistically at 240 FPS if we need
something extremely extremely high-speed
it can do up to 960 fps and here's like
like just I have all these ideas in my
head of stuff we can do with this like
all of a sudden we'll be able to
empirically evaluate the performance in
terms of input lag on an LCD monitor
because all we'll have to do is take a
microphone put it next to a mouse and go
like this hit it so you take a video all
the LCD monitor
guess you could you could put the mouse
in there as well and then all you have
to do is sync up with the sound it made
when you tap the mouse and you'll have
to have the microphone link right next
to it we don't want the delay of the
sound causing any ill effects actually
you know you should probably keep the
mouse in the shot so you can really see
that point of contact and we should be
able to in theory get down to the exact
frame at 960 fps okay 960 fps the exact
frame where we touched the mouse then we
can count how many frames until the
monitor responds and I don't know if
this is gonna work maybe it's totally
stupid
maybe 960 fps isn't enough but I'm super
excited to try it out so I'm thinking if
we have like a CRT on one side and an
LCD on the other side we can just try it
and see like how much if we take like a
su says 144 Hertz LCD and put that next
to a CRT how much of a difference is
there are the CRT diehards missing out
by avoiding LCD or are they still right
is it still the fastest way to gain so
so that's something that's super
exciting so my new gear is coming next
week ah so I've got HDMI capture cards
coming which means I won't have to use
this webcam anymore I've got a new
microphone coming I've got a new tripod
coming new lights all kinds of crazy
stuff so I'm not gonna look all pale and
ghostly like this unless I do look pale
and ghostly like this in which case you
know sorry dudes that means I just don't
know how to use this gear that I you
know blew a bunch of money on which
would be a very sad thing indeed very
sad thing indeed 247 new interactions ok
so we're gonna try and do a little a
couple a couple more cuties and then I
think oh you know what before we do more
Q&amp;amp;A let's do the giveaway announcement
nimble will finish up with a little bit
of Q&amp;amp;A so I received and I've got my
notes here you know what I'll just let
you guys go through the notes go through
the notes with me so first I want to say
the winner and I hope you're watching I
was my original plan was to have it be
so that only someone who is watching
could win but I realized you know what
that's not really fair I mean anyone who
does a draw does a draw and then you get
in touch with the person who won before
I okay before I announce the winner I
want
a little bit about the format of a
contest the format of the contest was
wrong my original idea was that the
first one to complete the task should
win however I made some mistakes in the
task that made it so I couldn't really
do it that way so I required people to
format and punctuate the secret phrase
which they had to jump around to
different videos and check out and
discover and then ungentle so the secret
phrase I had them format I want but from
the format exactly the way I did
unfortunately I formatted it incorrectly
so the secret phrase was I finished the
quest where's my swag and I had a period
on the word quest and I was missing a
question mark on the word swag what I
also didn't realize when I was creating
the challenge was that I finished my
quest
weres the swag would also be a correct
way to solve the puzzle so instead of
taking the first person who replied
exactly the way that I had it written
which took I mean there were over a
hundred correct sort of correct like not
what I had in mind but correct responses
where they added a question mark or they
they switched around the the and the my
before the one who formatted it the way
that I had wanted in my head for it to
be formatted and I didn't think it was
fair to do it that way so what I did is
I took all the people that did answer it
correctly I dropped them all in Excel
them and generated a random number and
the winner is can I get a drumroll
can everybody drumroll please Bernard
Yip
so that's your email address I'll email
you if you're okay okay we have to go
okay we have to go to Twitter though so
there's some notes here I'm going to go
to Twitter after Bernard if you're on
Twitter please message me or email me
again I can have a look at my email on
the other screen let me know if you're
watching I hope you're watching and I
hope you're excited because you are
going to be the proud owner of a geforce
gtx 660ti whoa and the shipping is free
don't worry about it I'll cover the
shipping even though it's expensive do
you guys have any idea how much it cost
me to ship the Duke Nukem the Duke Nukem
Nvidia price which was a GTX 580 I think
480 something like that 580 3d vision
monitor
and a copy of Duke Nukem $500 it costs
to ship that to the winner $500
un-freakin'-believable
um so anyway okay I'm gonna have a look
at my email over here and in the
meantime so yeah okay these were all my
notes for everything I wanted to talk
about so I accepted any of those answers
so with or without punctuation and with
bhuvah and the my switched around I did
end up requiring the period because
there were already so many people that
did have the period in there that's but
yeah it ended up having to work that way
now the way that I'm gonna do it next
time in order to make it more fair
especially for people in other time
zones I feel for you guys is I am going
to leave it for a couple days maybe two
or three days I might have a longer
treasure hunt so that's more difficult
but then what I'll do is I'll give you
guys a couple days and then I'll have
everyone submit and then I will do a
random draw and I'll make that very
clear from the beginning I'm sorry that
this wasn't better organized and yeah so
so you know hey congratulations to the
winner and I don't see an email from him
yet but you know hopefully he'll get in
touch soon and thank you guys so much
for participating it's just been awesome
and I think that wraps it up for the
giveaway we've got six minutes left so
let's do some more QA and that is the
most terrifying thing that I think I've
seen today that that is that is horrible
dude he says I think I've made the best
t-shirt ever and by best t-shirt I think
he means the t-shirt that will like get
him kicked out of places
that's awful I'm gonna go ahead and
favorite that that's terrific all right
Daniel talk about non reference graphics
cards and fully custom liquid cooling
what happened to person like
seventy-nine build Daniel I had an
update on the X 79 bill not a week ago
so I'm still working on it I'm hoping to
get it done in this calendar year
talking about non reference graphics
cards and fully custom liquid cooling
unless you have a manufacturer in mind
that has already made a water block for
your non reference card if you want a
water cooler card get a reference card
because it's very different difficult
these days to water
cool a video card without a full cover
block and full cover blocks do not work
on non-compatible cards so it just
doesn't work that way
esteban what would you recommend
gigabyte next 79s up5 Wi-Fi or whatever
or whatever okay or asrock x79 extreme
9x 79 su p5 that I mean asking me that
is kind of like asking me what would you
recommend the motherboard that you're
using that you're using which is that's
the motherboard I'm using or some other
motherboard asrock is not one of my
preferred motherboard manufacturers so I
I prefer a susanna Messiaen gigabyte so
I would definitely go with the gigabyte
option there
Markus if you were to build an LGA 1155
PC today what mother wouldn't CPU would
you choose you know what great question
but there's a lot of different answers
and I'm gonna tie this into what one of
the other guys here asked I saw
something about talking about ITX gaming
if I was gonna build an LGA 1155 PC I
would want to take advantage of the fact
that it can fit in a very small form
factor so I'd probably go with something
like in ASU's p8z 77 i deluxe okay so
there's a z77 ITX board then I'd go with
something like an external sound card
like you know what I don't have it next
to me anymore
so you can't use the onboard sound on
that it's terrible but well it's not
terrible that it's not it's onboard
sound so I've used some kind of external
USB DAC and has a headphone amp and all
that kind of stuff so I'd do that and
then I'd probably go with a 35 70 K
because I'm assuming this is for like a
portable gaming machine and then I'd
throw probably something like a 660ti in
there so hey Bernard
there's my recommendation for what you
do with this card and then in terms of
case I'd probably go with either that
coolermaster one that I just unboxed the
Elite 120 I think it's called or I'd go
with a silverstone FTO 3 which is a
sweet sweet case the mini one the mini
one FTO 3 mini Joel what do you like so
much about the TJ o7 it looks like it's
showing its age to me something that is
timeless and classic doesn't age at ejo
7 ages like like a fine wine or like a
perfectly cut steak
it is showing its age in terms of
features which I can fix I can cut cable
management holes I can throw in mounting
for whatever it is I need to put in it
but you cannot fix beautiful design and
I love the unibody shape I love the size
the efficiency of the size I mean a
cosmos to actually can't fit anymore
water-cooling crap Benanti jo7
i mean maybe a little bit more but when
you look at the difference in size it's
the efficiency of the layout of the
internals that makes the TGF 7 so
appealing you can fit all this
water-cooling crap in there and it's
still not that big like it's big but
it's not that big um brian is there a
sound card you can recommend for a
balance between gaming music enjoyment
honestly anything from the asus line the
sonar line is gonna be awesome if you're
using headphones get one with a
headphone amp if you're using speakers
get one that doesn't have a headphone
amp because it doesn't matter and then
as for a balance between gaming and
music enjoyment good sound is good sound
i've always taken that philosophy about
it maybe to the most extreme of audio
files there will be some difference
between a gaming optimized sound card
and a music optimized sound card but the
reality of it is if it produces clear
sound you know deep bass rich mids clear
highs if it does all those things it'll
be great for games it'll be great for
movies and it will be great for music
did I say movies or music whatever all
three alright one more minute left so I
am going to take the next tweet the
tweet that's at the top sort of gonna be
my thing where I take like the top tweet
I'm gonna click it now Michael great
question Michael this is a fantastic
question why do TVs have 240 Hertz plus
and not monitors fantastic question
Michael TVs are doing this ok this is
your leg this is them pulling it your
960 Hertz or 480 Hertz clear motion or
whatever it is they're doing on the TV
is not
a 960 hertz panel it doesn't work that
way you are not actually seeing 960 or
let's use your example so your example
is 240 you are not seeing 240 image
refreshes every second HDMI is not even
remotely capable of carrying that kind
of bandwidth even the new revised HDMI
is not capable of carrying more than
1080p 120 frames per second that's the
one with the faster processors on either
end and whatever 1.4 a or something like
that who cares HDMI sucks but what
they're doing is they are not just
refreshing the image so let's say here's
your motion ok so something's moving
across the screen like this these are
your frames ok so instead of just doing
this so let's say let's say we've got 4
frames 1 2 3 4 to show you the motion in
between each of those frames they are
flickering the backlight and that plays
a trick on your eye that makes so if
they go to flicks and one frame two
flicks and one frame two flicks one
frame it plays a trick with your eye
that makes the motion look smoother but
also has sort of a strange effect that
makes it look unnaturally smooth to some
people so when you see someone saying
this is a 240 Hertz TV or 480 Hertz TV
they are referring to the modulation of
the backlight not to the refresh rate of
the actual LCD panel so that's a really
important clarification that's why there
were so many 120 Hertz TVs out there
that people were talking about or they
wanted to buy or they were even
mistakingly buying with the intention of
running 3d vision or something with
their graphics card getting in a
middleware driver and they're trying to
do this only to realize that they're 120
Hertz TV was only a 60 Hertz panel it
wasn't even capable of displaying a left
and a right image at 60 Hertz for each
eye with 3d glasses so fantastic
question and thank you very much for
asking it thank you guys so much for
participating those of you who are here
