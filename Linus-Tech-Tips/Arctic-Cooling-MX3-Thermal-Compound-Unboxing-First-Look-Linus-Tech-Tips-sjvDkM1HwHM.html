cooling Arctic mx3 thermal compound I
actually had to restart this one because
I made some kind of stupid comments
about how you shouldn't eat it I do
maintain that you shouldn't eat it but
let's actually just talk about the specs
of this stuff so this is Arctic
Cooling's latest thermal compound it is
an updated version of the mx2
which is an updated version of MX one
and basically what they're saying is
this one performs better and it's
awesome okay it has eight year
durability so that means you can use
your computer for eight years without
without reapplying this stuff before it
cracks or dries out or anything like
that has high thermal conductivity low
thermal resistance those are the same
thing pretty much for our purposes by
the way it is electrically
non-conductive and non capacitive that
is way more important that means that if
you don't follow the proper instructions
for applying it and you do get it on
your motherboard or on something else
then it will not cause those parts to
short out it is non curing which means
it is working up to its full potential
immediately unlike some competing
thermal compounds it is non-corrosive
and non bleeding and I'm not sure how
either of those are particularly
relevant but it's all good
ok so basically they show a graph on the
back from hardware lux showing how it
performs compared to a bunch of other
thermal compounds in the market so
they're saying you can expect up to
about 7 degrees better than standard
thermal compound so that generic white
goop so why don't we
without further ado get this box opened
up here oh and this is dangerous for the
environment and they have a picture of a
dead tree in it but that is the most
awesome warming table I have ever seen
on any product ever because it is like
yeah don't put this in the water and
don't put it on a plank because it will
kill the plants in the fish okay so
there is our tube it looks just like the
tube for mx2 and it has oh this is cool
I've actually never seen this before
they actually have a little meter where
you can see how much is left that is the
smartest thing ever because you always
had to just eyeball it based on pushing
down the plunger on the syringe anyway
you open it up you
a bit to your CPU and then you win oh I
accidentally got it out okay thank you
for checking out my unboxing of Arctic
cooling mx3</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
