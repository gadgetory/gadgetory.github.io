quote from our new employee Taran it's
not a printer the answer is no in fact
it is a computer cube cases are back in
fashion and fractal design has thrown
their hat into the proverbial box to
compete with the existing offerings like
The Prodigy M from BitFenix the air 540
from Corsair and the half XB from
coolermaster the CM storm SF 17 uses a
massive 18 centimeter fan to cool your
gaming notebook and it adds a four port
USB hub click now to learn more starting
with the outside fractals traditional
clean Scandinavian design aesthetic is
definitely present here the front of the
case is a combination of brushed
aluminum with a subtle curvature to it
and mesh for airflow with a small
fractal design logo and power led as the
only ornaments on the right hand side we
find two front USB 3 ports headphone and
microphone jacks and a slimline optical
drive mount that actually hides inside
the front bezel this is a really smart
compromise between wasting space on a
bunch of five and a quarter inch bays
and omitting them entirely like NZXT did
on the aged 440 and when we pop the
front bezel off we find not only that
slimline mount but also a couple of tuna
half inch SSD mounts with some cable
management room two dual 120 millimeter
removable fan filters and the cleverness
continues very very nice the top cover
slides off with a couple of thumb screws
at the back just like the our committee
does revealing some unfortunately
difficult lot basically impossible to
remove noise dampening foam as well as
dual fan mounts on each side on the
right is a dual 120 / 140 millimeter fan
mount that will work with the 240 or 280
millimeter radiator if you remove the
hard drive cages first and on the left
is a dual 120 / 140 millimeter fan mount
that looks like it would support a two
hundred and eighty millimeter radiator
but due to clearance constraints with
the cooling on your motherboard
and memory it supports only a 240
millimeter radiator like we've got in
there on the back of the case we find a
three fan speed controller settings for
low medium and high definitely nice to
have but it would have been even better
if it was pre cable managed and you know
already like plugged in and ready to
rock like NZXT does on their cases and
we also find a couple more fan mounts
boy in this case has a lot of those up
to 10 fans total in the front atop and
the back the last thing on the back is
motherboard IO and 5 PCI slots which is
a great configuration since it allows to
dual slot graphics cards and an
additional PCI Express expansion card in
between with certain motherboards such
as the sniper that we have installed
right now on the bottom of the case are
a couple more fan filters it looks like
fractal expects this case to be
configured for negative airflow since
one of them sits right under the power
supply and the other sits kind of in the
middle of nowhere just as a random extra
filtered intake there are a couple of
drive mounts on top of it that can be
used for three and a half inch or two
and a half inch drives we did one of
each just to try it out and the only
complaint here was that the drives are
so close to the bottom of the case that
many SATA power connectors will not fit
very well and there's only one cable
management spot running to one of them
so the one on the left is a bit of a
tight fit to run power and data two on
the left we've got a nice large side
panel window that we can remove to
reveal one side of the segregated
internal so on this side we've got the
skinny white PCI slot covers and then on
this side the powerful black power
supply cables are well wait hold on a
second both sides actually have both
black and white stuff on them because
this is the 21st century
Donald anyway with the side panels out
of the way we can see that the inside is
segregated only for the purpose of
creating thermal zones so on this side
we've got the N ATX motherboard which
takes up pretty much the entire height
of the case that's what makes the note
804 so short
those two drive slots that I talked
about before
our AIO liquid cooler that fits but
required us to swap low profile memory
for the dominators that we had planned
to use the design is actually similar to
other cubes but the cable management
choices that we can see here seemed a
little bit odd we've got these two
massive holes on the right and at the
bottom which combined with the large CPU
cutout at the back weaken the
motherboard tray significantly then
along the bottom we just get zip tie
mounting points instead of additional
holes for front USB audio and the like
I'd have rather seen fractal includes
smaller holes for the 24 pin and video
card connectors and use that extra
strength to put in some other strategic
mounting holes instead moving over to
the back side we've got room for as long
a power supplies you could possibly want
and some cool velcro tie downs in the
cable management zone that reveal
another reason I might like to have
smaller grommeted holes on the
motherboard tray so I can keep this
rat's nest out of sight we also find the
bulk of the hard drive mounts in total
there are eight three and a half inch
drive mounts here but I suspect most
people would have trouble actually cable
managing all of that in here we used the
little spot on the top to simplify
routing the eight pin motherboard
connector and fan controller cables but
there's still just overall not a lot of
room to work back here and it was easier
to mount our rear hard drive in the
second from the bottom slot so that we
had room for cables behind it if you
were clever enough and used tricks like
pre plugging in the drives and then
installing them in the case and whatnot
this would bring your total up to ten
three and a half inch drives and two two
and a half inch drives which is
extremely impressive especially when you
consider that additional fans can easily
be mounted to keep them all adequately
cool so if you figure it out Wow alright
so let's just close with some general
thoughts about the case
embedded thumb screws are awesome NZXT
is using them on their side panels and I
want everyone to start doing it they
don't cost much more and they really are
a hassle saver so you don't lose your
screws fractal would have liked to see
those included the overall build quality
of the case is quite good there is some
flex to the chassis without the side
down
is installed so it can kind of flex it a
little bit here but once they're on it
is completely rock-solid
I love the compactness of this case it
feels a lot more space efficient than
something like a prodigy that with its
feet isn't actually much smaller but
only accepts an ITX board and the bunch
of drives or an N ATX board and just a
couple of drives for that version but
those usual challenges with small cases
are definitely here building in the case
in the first place isn't the easiest
thing in the world and upgrades will
feel like a chore for full tower users
when they need to remove entire hard
drive cages just to install one new
drive for example it's not a hard core
criticism of the node 804 or anything so
much as it is a warning for anyone
buying it
no amount of smart internal design adds
volume to the inside of a case so as
long as you're aware of what you're
buying
then fractals latest reimagining of what
I felt was a pretty well-established
case category gets a big thumbs up from
me it's a great choice for a classy
looking compact gaming rig and it can
also double as a pretty robust storage
box as well thank you for watching guys
