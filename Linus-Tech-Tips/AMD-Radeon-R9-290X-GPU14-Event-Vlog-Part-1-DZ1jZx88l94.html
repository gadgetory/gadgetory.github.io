optimized for silent operation click now
to learn more so I guess I should
actually start making some videos on
this trip this will be the first really
exciting thing we're headed on to the
USS Missouri so for a dinner kind of
event you can't really get the scale of
a ship into the shot here which really
speaks to well the scale of it so here's
some guys making videos about it as well
it's a nice camera you got there thank
you
that's a pretty nice when you got there
- thank you good choice that's you yeah
the shoe man there's a Paul's audio
recorder which is of course what I'm
focused on right now here it's
definitely definitely heavily strapped
heavily straps so I've decided to become
a vlogger which is uh which is tiring
for the left arm unlike the other things
that I do timed up your skill your
one-handed abilities my one-handed
abilities I just got I just got work on
it tomorrow you know get some more some
more - more exercise so all kinds of
cool stuff going on here there's a non
from a non tech there we go well we got
a wave to you should you should
interview him again my my out my staff
wouldn't let me post it because they
figured I was being too much of a
fangirl the entire time they were like
there I was like come on can't you edit
it down they're like yeah you were
basically blushing the entire time hit
edit know your entire body you were
commenting on the body language you
really
yeah you know what I'm just gonna I'm
gonna find the footage at some point I'm
just gonna post it without them cuz I
don't even know where they put it but
this does a nosedive into an end that's
okay I may be the one editing and
uploading this so none of this will get
pulled out this time
and now on my vlog of the USS Missouri
Paul learns to take a picture with his
camera phone do they even call them
camera phones anymore is that like
enough Wow really
oh wait that's like Oh remove one's
hands from in front of the camera lens
and the lens cap - it's not really a
problem with camera Wow pretty fancy
stuff I mean you're probably not used to
this sort of thing you know like
styrofoam cups and like bath water to
drink out of it I mean this is this is
you're moving up in the world
no Solo cups so we weren't able to find
bath water but we were able to find like
battleship Missouri water there's bears
and eNOS drinking red wine I heard you
weren't feeling well this morning I was
feeling excellent okay like Paul's
Hardware intro excellent know your
sources are Paul's all the faulty
information a Paul Paul's my source Oh
what okay so I'm touring the ship with
the elusive Skye MTL of hard work
Canucks but I was told I'm I'm not to
not to show his face or anything like
that but we're hanging out so for those
of you who read Hardware canucks you'll
appreciate the the quality of what he
brings to his work I certainly have over
the years so that's a really big gun not
compensating for anything of course
though here's like people for scale
right
how many people could you you know fire
out of it and want to go under it's like
if the circus needs gonna look like that
ceilings get a little low here
hey the fan room
one declare any fans in that who
decontamination station senior dental
officer no way that's fantastic
and no dentist's chair so I guess his
job was to tell you yes just reveal out
over the water from the ship this is
awesome
here's the new year let's go in and find
out what we got to eat we didn't really
get a choice of menu so I hope it's
awesome
pree Boston right now so I'm going to
turn around my camera
just see how long it takes it
the server's giving me a weird look
right now about that
that didn't take very long I think he
noticed me
yeah that's okay I don't know who's
creepier at this point the guy
videotaping the other guy the guy
holding the camera what I mean this is
this is a very negative stereotype about
that is that whole cameras way too close
to them out
how's your food
delicious that looks pretty good did you
just get your food
that's awesome
awesome really good feel like your whole
thing where it's all like yeah I get
like right down at the ocean for you yes
absolutely terrifying I love it
so tell me something did they seat all
the Newegg guys together because no one
else would sit with you
one person kind of more distinguished
section the distinguished section where
you're getting your food now and I
finish mine like three minutes ago yeah
yeah no our food was served like last
for a reason you know I don't think you
guys are last either I think you're just
kind of
we're definitely last definitely
passively last on the list okay whatever
makes you feel better do you were
actually last on the list weren't you
that was because I'm the best
so AMD's got an automated little board
over here that's grabbing anything with
hashtag GPU 14 in it so it seems a few
troll messages someone's asking about a
round of golf for tomorrow at a given
time and
see what do we got here oh no okay so
these are these are some legit ones but
I send out my tomates so I'm hoping to
have my 15 seconds of fame with my oh
hey there's a blog far there's a post
from Paul's hardware so I'm hoping to
have my 15 seconds of fame up there
pretty soon well the nights over this
has been fun and tomorrow's gonna be a
very very big day I hope I'll find some
time to cut this together tonight then
you guys can all be excited about what
AMD has in store for us tomorrow there's
that guy again
can't stand that guy this guy's kind of
ducked out of the way of my video here
but it's not gonna work I'm creeping him
again he's creeping me to that troll
face okay so uh that's that that's some
cool water that you got on your your
camera there yes
it's waterproof yeah hopefully we'll see
yeah fingers fingers crossed because you
know what it's funny cuz I had a similar
experience with my fs700 where it got
some rain on it and I was like well yeah
you know it's made of plastic you know
not that much water could like you know
get into it right I can't I can't
actually say much because I actually
accidentally left this I'm about to me
last night because I was out filming my
iPhone review I just like left it out
there so it probably got wet last night
you terrible good Twitter seal this part
might not be wolf all sipping icy green
light I say green like we're good guys
green light light so it's clearly that
could be like green for green for those
go deep screw yourself because I hate me
forgetting water on me</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
