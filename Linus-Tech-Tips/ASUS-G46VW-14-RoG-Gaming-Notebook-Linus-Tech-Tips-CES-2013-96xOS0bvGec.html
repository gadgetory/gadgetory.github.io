have bought one of these like what was
my first year of university like eight
years ago
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys
I would have bought one of these like
that because it's an actual portable
gaming machine instead of being a 7-inch
monstrosity this guy right here is a
14-inch machine that actually has the
same packs the same kind of punch as its
larger brethren it does sacrifice a
little bit on the thickness in order to
achieve that because check this out
beastly aluminum Finn coolers here
because there is still stuff to cool
down this particular one comes with a
quad core i7
or a Core i5 processor a gtx 660 m and
the typical rugged that's really strong
rugged styling of a Seuss's g series so
you can see from a distance you might
not even know that this is a fourteen
inch gaming notebook especially because
I'm more of a small person but if we
were to have slick hold this for example
slick see now you can tell how small it
is very very cool stuff in terms of the
of the overall finish they've got a soft
touch on the top beautiful Asus logo
with an illuminated Republic of gamers
logo as well on the bottom again nice
matte finish scratch resistant so you're
not gonna have to worry about scuffing
it up too bad that is but let's go ahead
and check this out so we've got power in
gigabit ethernet to super speed USB 3
this is a thunderbolt enabled notebook
very very cool stuff microphone and
headphones of course they're gonna need
those for gaming SD expansion
HDMI another super speed USB 3 and VGA I
still like to see VGA on notebooks
especially ones that are versatile ok so
think about this VGA the situation I
usually give where you might need it is
something like a business trip where you
want to be able to hook up to like a
projector or something now think of it
in terms of a land party the lands got
an older projector you want to hook it
up you want to play some games you've
got your VGA output now think about this
you're a business guy you're on business
trip but you want to play some games see
now you got your HDMI oh you got your
gaming capabilities you got your form
factor that is actually possible to
travel with so that's extremely exciting
see if there's anything else that we
missed here about Thunder pool dual dual
rear venting system boost stability and
I believe that and it's available in a
variety of configurations including with
an SSD oh oh oh and SATA cool mSATA SSD
so that means you could set up like
caching or you could have your OS own
SSD and then a bigger hard drive for
storage that's very cool so thank you
for checking out this video from the AC
suite and don't forget to subscribe make
sure you see all of our CS 2013 comfort
you're going to be showing you guys lots
of cool stuff thanks for watching - tech
