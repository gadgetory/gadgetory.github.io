brought to you by HyperX fury series
high performance SSDs the Corsair
Vengeance k70 and k9t RGB mechanical
keyboards and NCIX comm are trusted
retailer for high performance gaming pcs
alright guys we're here at the monoprice
booth which is housing origin PC and
we're checking out their millennium case
it's a pretty interesting case outside
of things like four-way SLI
compatibility in a mid Tower which is
damn impressive and stuff like
customizable lighting zones with
different colors and different modes all
kind of stuff with the outside of the
case controller which is also very
interesting they have some pretty
intense stuff
my favorite part personally is actually
the full metal aluminum hard drive base
that they have from another company they
just bought that Bay and put it right in
their case because it's that good you
don't see many companies spend that much
money on their own case so it's nice be
able to see that and their insane amount
of different configurations motherboards
setup so you can have it as a rear
exhaust or top exhaust you can have it
on the left window right window doesn't
matter you tell them away you wanted to
set it up or you can set up yourself
they can walk you over it on the phone
although I don't really think they
advertise that the main drawback in my
opinion is that as of right now you
can't buy this case by itself if you
want this case honestly straight up
you're gonna have to buy the computer
eBay all the components and then just
have the case or I guess you could just
try to buy a computer from Origin PC
whatever floats your personal boat but I
don't know if you guys want this case a
lot you can tweet at them be be
aggressive and try to see if they'll
maybe open the door so I'd like to be
able to see this case up for sale at
some point in time it also has really
nice things like cable management
another huge worry that I had about this
case when I first saw it was cable
management if you're gonna be able to
have the window in all these different
locations and top exhaust and rear
exhaust and all these different things I
was worried that it's gonna be hard to
tune the case for a kale management
that's gonna make sense but it doesn't
seem to be that much of a problem about
grommets all over place and it's
absolutely beautiful another thing is
that both doors are on dual hinges which
might not sound like a lot but that's
actually pretty sweet if this isn't
enough Tower for you you're looking for
more liquid cooling looking for more
hard drive bays or SSD bays they also
have the Genesis which is a millennium
with like an extendable stack on the
bottom where you can have
three-sixty radiators or if you don't
want to do water cooling you can have 16
hard drives or 32 SSDs so if you need
all that storage for like 4k rendering
or something like that I don't know what
you're doing but you can have all that
storage or for that folder that you
don't really talk about whatever you
want it'll work for you anyways thanks
for watching this video I hope you see
