be completely boring for some people but
really exciting for others because it is
a mini ITX case that houses six three
and a half inch hard drives and one two
and a half inch drive so that means if
you're into Windows Home Server or any
other kind of home storage software or
if you if you have a media PC that you
like to keep a lot of content stored on
this is for you this is an aluminum case
this is the fractal design array are two
mini ITX case I guess I'll show you what
it says on the outside so the case size
it looks like they actually made some
adjustments to the box but it's 250 by
250 millimeters so it's quite small it's
compatible with mini ITX boards it has a
140 millimeter fan which is also very
impressive for a mini ITX case I already
talked about all that storage space okay
there's a little bit about fractal
design itself and then finally I just
want to show you what it says on the
front oh yes and it does also include a
300 watt SFX power supplies so that's
pretty sweet as well so let's go ahead
get this open thought I wanted to okay I
have not seen this one in person yet
although everything that I've seen from
fractal designs so far has looked great
on paper and then looked even better in
person so I have very very high
expectations for the array r2 I
apologize for it taking me so long to do
this unboxing but this haven't really
gotten around
for some reason alright now one thing
that I have on fairly good authority but
you know keep it to yourself is that
this case is actually om at least in
part by Lee and Lee so the finish on it
you can already see is just outstanding
a beautiful black anodized aluminum
finish all over the outside of this case
very clean looking which is something
that we've come to expect from fractal
design just lots of straight edges
ventilation holes and places where they
make sense and an overall elegant
elegant design and look and feel to the
case so I'm going to flip it over on its
side oh I feel terrible flipping it on
to its eye on the table so this looks so
nice so I'm going to just put down some
plastic here and there we go so you can
see that it does have four rubber feet
on the bottom and we've got yet another
looks like this panel is actually
removable the Assembly of the case looks
quite modular so I'm going to have to go
get a screwdriver so we can take this
apart so we're going to a voyage of
discovery about how exactly all of this
fits together right now so I removed the
top panel and you can see we've actually
got some noise dampening material here
on the top alright so you got to be
really careful when you're handling
these are these anodized aluminum panels
because as soon as you touch them once
the oil from your fingers will leave a
fingerprint on it that you can't even
remove so you want to be really careful
when you're working with cases like this
and this goes for pretty much all
anodized aluminum surfaces and even some
of the non anodized aluminum cases you
just got to be very very careful now the
the screws on the top allowed me to
remove the top panel and then these two
screws here appear to loosen the hard
drive cage which is here so that's where
we mount our six hard drives and I have
yet to figure out exactly how to remove
this part oh you know what I figured it
out but this is going to take a little
while I think I have to remove the
screws on the bottom so you can see that
there is some disassembly required for
this case so I better just turn off the
camera permit all right well after about
20 screws and removing some completely
unnecessary parts I think I finally
figured out how it works so you do not
remove the screws in the side actually
what you do is you remove the four
screws in the top of the hard drive cage
which slides in like this and then when
we move the power supply cables over
there so you can see it rests on top of
these black pads so that you get some
anti vibration action going on there and
so you just screw those in and I'm just
going to remove it for the sake of
showing you guys some of the other
things that are included so maybe I can
also figure out where the two and a half
inch drive goes hmm oh there it is so
the two and a half inch drive mounts on
the bottom of this and you can see that
there are four convenient screw driver
holes located here so you can actually
screw the drive in and then it just sits
on the bottom of the entire hard drive
cage so this holds six three and a half
inch and two wide rather one two and a
half inch drive all right now let's
finally look at the accessories and
what's inside of the case so here we
have motherboard screws we have lots of
hard drive screws and that's pretty much
it we've got one cable management tie
and then we have our motherboard tray
which I removed which is entirely
unnecessary so what I would like to do
is this back down get some of the stuff
out of my mail comes with a power cord
since it does include a power supply so
I can take this put it back on top where
it belongs
and now we can examine what the inside
of the case looks like so here we go
here is the SFX power supply you can see
that it is a 300 watt unit capable of
providing up to 14 amps
on one of the 12-volt rails and 16 amps
on the other 12 volt rail so it does
have two 12-volt rails in terms of
connectors we have a 24-pin connector oh
no way is that it is that a 20 pin no
it's a 24 pin good yeah we have a 24 pin
so a 20 + 4 and then we also have a 4
pin
p4 connector and then go figure we've
got a bunch of SATA power so how many of
those do we have we have one two three
four five six seven SATA power which
makes sense because that's how many
drives it holds and then we have one
additional molex connector so this is
pretty much designed to power your board
your drives and that's it
the front 140 millimeter fan hooks up
via a three pin fan connector and you
can see that the whole front assembly
for the 140 millimeter fan is held in by
three screws at the top and it's also
held in by matching three screws at the
bottom so you can remove this whole
thing put on a different fan if you so
desire and it can be easily replaced
that way the front panel connectors are
here so we've got a power switch as well
as a power LED and that is it the front
of the case is very clean and they're
able to achieve that by only having one
switch and then the LED is actually
inside there you've got space for two
expansion carts so that is you can
install one expansion card with ITX
or you can install one dual slot card
although I wouldn't be expecting to
install any any long graphics cards
unless you make some modifications to
the hard drive cage which you could
quite easily do now that I look at it
although you'd have to make some
modifications to the power supply
mounting and you'd be you'd be making
some pretty serious modifications to the
case itself not something that I think
is for the first time
modern necessarily but it does look
doable actually if you wanted to take
this out you could probably cut out a
new hole for a full-size ATX power
supply and then you could probably chop
this off and do up to like a 12-inch
graphics card in here
kind of cool anyway that is my unboxing
and first look at the fractal design
