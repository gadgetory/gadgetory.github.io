cable I think the microphone is set to
allow exclusivity mode and then Skype
was open and I think Skype grabbed the
mic in between recording the local
recording and actually going live so I
ended up being completely silent okay so
what I was trying to say that whole time
in a very long around about way if it
helps it all actually hadn't really said
anything yet I was mostly just killing
time what I was trying to say is that
our New Year's resolution is to start
the show on time and that those of you
with calendars or fancy phone image
Agurs in your pockets have probably
realized there's not the New Year yet so
that's why we are nine minutes late but
in that time I have been tooling around
with getting the audio working for a
while and so we are actually more like
14 minutes late but there's that and and
and I was also going to address that
focus right on account of Christmas or
something was this has not managed to
come by it this is actually an audio
interface that we bought they're going
to bring some other gear but they have
not managed to come out here yet they're
going to come in the new year and we are
definitely going to be upgrading the
audio setup to something that is not a
USB microphone will be all XLR and fancy
and nice and and all that good stuff
it's really it's really funny though we
had a call with them a little while ago
and they were just like hey um so we
couldn't help noticing that you know you
guys are recording in a warehouse and so
we were thinking like you know I don't
know maybe you'd want to put up like
some sound deadening so you don't get
that echo and I was like yeah you know
what that's really the least of our
problems I mean if we can have audio
working at all and like a compressor
would be great then we're going to call
that good and they're like yeah but like
we really think that with these other
additional things that we're like I'm
like yeah it's a set
that we use literally one-and-a-half
hours a week so if we're creating a
bunch of clutter they're like yeah but
we think we can make it sound really
good I'm like you know what let's just
get it working and then we'll worry
about making it sound amazing how about
it just works first and then we go from
there so oh hey we have a special guest
for the wine show today hey Vaughn can I
borrow you for a minute oh I just wanted
my three-month-old daughter to make a
special appearance on wine show today is
she able to do that she kind of cranky
right now okay oh and oh oh man they get
heavy fast so this is definitely how to
handle a baby um when you are streaming
live there you go
so that's my new baby I really don't
know what she's looking at you can tell
that she is my daughter because she is
wearing her brother's hand-me-downs
that is the way that you can tell that
and um hi are you gonna smile for us
hello oh she doesn't want to play the
tickle the nose game hey what are you
even looking at what if I bounce you wow
you're getting really heavy hello
okay yep and she was not stoked on that
guest appearance and we're done so uh
all right we've got a lot of great
topics for you guys today which is a
total lie but we do have a couple of
topics so Amazon patents reveal I won't
call this a plan but they reveal talk I
guess of flying warehouses that send
delivery drones to your door there's a
rumor that HTC is expected to unveil the
vive - at CES 27 already
I just bought a vibe um okay
and Tesla predicts accidents and gives
warning before it happens and in a
Florida a Florida senator says we
shouldn't need a permit for driverless
cars so uh there you go
let's go ahead and roll the intro see if
it works is it going to work
oh there's no there's no music yep well
you know what freshbooks
there we go freshbooks calm /when and
there's no reason to stay here and stare
at the intro because there is no awesome
music to go with it so this is kind of a
you know what here this is a perfect
opportunity for me to talk about sort of
one of the challenges that I think we've
had with the wine show computer so we
learned recently that the best way to
update xsplit is to fully uninstall it
and reinstall it I did not know that
apparently what xsplit does if you just
install updates on top of updates on top
of updates is it only updates certain
parts of the program so if you've ever
had xsplit have like the old icon in
your taskbar but then you launch it it
has the new logo on the splash screen
but then it has like the older style of
theme that's why so I have an issue with
xsplit right now where I can't play a
vis and so that's why I can't play our
normal intros they play slowly all of
them but I was even able to playback a
much higher bitrate file which is our
old old intro but one that doesn't have
audio and that's how I temporarily got
it working but then I have never looked
at it again and so it's very very
temporary and - the army of people
demanding that we use OBS OBS is a
steaming pile in completely different
ways so yes I have used OBS and I have
hust xsplit and in this case I'm going
with the devil that I know if anyone has
a suggestion that is not OBS then I'll
be willing to listen to it yeah but uh
thank you thank you to all the
suggestions for OBS but yeah I'm not
pretending that xsplit is perfect I am
literally in the middle of complaining
about it
but that doesn't mean that OBS is great
sorry alright so let's go ahead and jump
into one of our topics here wow I could
really use some water but we are so
short right now on people I don't even
know if there's someone that I could cry
to to bring me a bottle of water at the
moment so the original article here is
from Tech Crunch Amazon patents show
flying warehouses that send delivery
drones to your door figure figure 3 look
at figure 3 okay so this warehouse has
this blimp or something so 3 350 okay so
blimp 350 goes like here or something
okay and then blimp 302 is like bigger
than blimp 350 and has like a warehouse
I mean tailspin anyone like oh thank you
Colton it like tailspin right like we're
just going to have like floating gas
stations and like Sky Pirates that
that's the Future Sky Pirates busting
into Amazon floating warehouses and like
the air police like right now we've got
police on foot we've got police in cars
we've got police in motorcycles police
and helicopters in Canada we have police
on horses and now we're going to have
police in airplanes it's going to happen
calling it right now December 30th 2016
was when line is predicted airplane
police which probably already exists
just calm down
but anyway so look back going back to
the going back to the screen share here
so the idea would be that you would have
these resupply drones carry supplies
presumably up to the art blimps not
drones I'm not going to call it a drone
sorry I mean it would probably be a
drone because it would probably be
automated but
besides the point so you'd have a
resupply blimp from the warehouse 332
the larger blimp 302 and then you would
have drones that like carries stuff to
the city and then like maybe returns
would go back to blimp 350 so so blimp
350 hold on a second so okay so drones
would go from the main warehouse to the
city and they could also go from blimp
350 to the city and then they could also
go up to 350 and then down from 302 to
the city so the idea being then I guess
that you would never be deploying more
aircraft than you need to get to the
final destination
very very cool I will now read the notes
because I basically made all that up as
I went from one diagram figure three bla
bla bla bla bla bla bla more detail bla
bla bla warehouse in a Zeppelin bla bla
bla including temperature control models
ideally suited for food delivery that
would be freakin awesome like food
coming down from the sky all my favorite
shows Cloudy with a Chance meatballs now
an example cited in the filing is that
at a sporting event Amazon AFC's could
be loaded above with snacks and
souvenirs so Amazon would be finding a
way to take bear eight to 15% cut I
forget exactly what it is to get
fulfillment by Amazon right now as a
third party seller we looked into it
with our Rancho hoodies but they're
basically trying to figure out how to
get there 10 to 15% cut on everything
amazing besides the airborne fulfillment
center so those are the AFC's and the
affiliated drones the company has
envisioned larger shuttles that could
carry people supplies and drones to the
FCS or back to the ground well that
sounds like the kind of future that I
would want to be a part of as long as we
don't run out of helium we'll be okay
because they start filling those things
with hydrogen then it doesn't take it
doesn't take - class futuretelling in
order to
figure out what's probably going to
happen at such time all right
let's move on to our next topic here
what on earth is Luke doing in the
background of the land show instead of
being here while he's waving to you for
one thing
and he's also finishing up hold on I'm
gonna move my chair out of the way that
I'm gonna move myself but who locks
these chairs who let's tear and sit in
these chairs okay he it's swear every
time teryn sits in a chair he adjusts
the seat so it's like a V instead of
like being flat on the bottom and he
locks the tilt I hate him okay
well it wasn't him this time actually
but anyway that's what get out of here
it's so easy to think you're not even
left we're not even in the frame which
is perfect Wow now I'm in the frame
terrible so anyway that's Luke oh what's
that
is that zero-gravity really but they
call it that
not really but they call it that perfect
sounds like marketing okay so Luke's
working on the surface studio video
which will be up at some point I
actually have no idea when I haven't
looked at the video tracker I've been
busy trying to throw together all of my
content for the lead-up to CES so as of
next week pretty much the whole company
is going to actually not even pretty
much the whole company so many people
now a big chunk of the company is going
to be out of town at the Consumer
Electronics Show which I've been
informed it is no longer called it was
called International CES okay sure I
mean never mind that CES did at least at
some point stands for Consumer
Electronics Show never mind that it is a
Consumer Electronic Show International
CES so that's where we'll be all next
week the plan is to turn out something
to the tune of 40 to 50 videos sponsored
by D Bray
and also some other companies actually I
don't even know if the D brand deal is
inked yet so now that I've said it he's
pretty much stuck right
anyway sponsored by D brand we're going
to be covering what's new in the PC
hardware space as well as consumer
electronics maybe even some camera crap
assuming Brandon can find some we're
going to put all that together for you
and you know pump out all those videos
within a span of about five to seven
days so stay tuned it's going to be a
glut of information on all the hot new
stuff that's going to be coming for
about the first half of 2017
speaking of CES rumors what is this
glove that you're not going to be
getting any love if you wear it like an
artist glove so when you're writing on
the screen this part of your hand is
gloved so it like doesn't put your oils
and whatnot from your hand on the screen
and it glides smoothly Oh
fancy yeah your falsetto is terrible and
very alarming we're disturbing what's
the word I'm looking for
unnerving alright so on the subject of
CES let's move into our next big topic
here HTC expected to unveil HTC vive two
at CES 2017 says report and the babies
crying sorry we're working on it so
according to Taipei based Central News
Agency the vive too is expected to
utilize a wireless transmitter to
connect with PC systems and to come with
two 4k displays and a monitor refresh
rate of a hundred and twenty Hertz
instead of 90 Hertz meanwhile HTC has
also reduced the price of vive devices
sold in China by 10% and this is
apparently to pave the way for the
launch of the vive - so I gotta jump in
here from dinner and actually I'm going
to ask Luke to jump in here for a minute
because we did hear about a third-party
accessory available for the vive which
if you guys recall is 1440p 90 Hertz so
let's go ahead and do some basic
calculator math here okay
I'm going to use calculator because
every time I try and do math in my head
live on the wind show I screw it up and
you guys all make fun of me and it hurts
my self-esteem very very much so
calculator math okay 2560 x 1440 okay x
so that's that's a three point six eight
six mega pixels per frame okay um wait a
second that doesn't
oh bloody hell that doesn't tell me the
data rate well whatever times 90
so every second 331 million megapixels
so you're going to tell me then we're
going to take that 331 million okay
everyone remember 331 million because I
can okay so 38 40 times 21 60 okay times
120 okay so you're going to tell me with
a straight face that what was already
from my conversations with Luke kind of
a Genki third party wireless accessory
what was already kind of janky we are
going to 3x the pixel count which to be
clear doesn't necessarily mean a
tripling of the needed bandwidth but it
will definitely be significantly higher
very very much higher so you're gonna
you're going to take that and you're
going to make wireless part of the out
of box experience I really don't know
how much stock to put in this rumor so
that's what I'll say about that I will
be thrilled as all heck if they are
actually showing off the vive - but
given that we don't really have a
contact at HTC or valve we haven't
gotten any kind of an early heads up nor
have we even got a meeting booked so if
they do show it I guess we will just
have to door crash and figure out how to
how to get a video shot of it all right
actually you know what I have I have a
very interesting straw poll for you guys
straw pulled me I only want to hear from
owners or people who are close enough to
an owner of an oculus rift or an HTC
vive okay this is very important the
very serious pull okay so owners of I'm
going to call them Premium VR headsets
how long since you last used it
okay so I'm gonna put ah
less than one week less than one month
and um more than one month ago okay I
want to hear from you guys I'm gonna
answer the poll but I want to hear some
results from you guys first who is
actually using their VR headsets out
there so I'm going to go ahead and hit
this straw poll again here and why are
you here because twitch chat is
incredibly upset that we haven't
confirmed that apparently the news is
fake about the vibe too so even though
you were saying that you don't think
it's fake don't believe it they're like
it's Frank and you're stupid for
believing it so but I didn't say I
believed it
exactly I said exactly I even did math
thanks fish which is not a strong point
guys in grade anyway
PC gamer released something 27 minutes
ago that HTC said it was fake so there
you go Oh 27 minutes ago well wat thanks
twitch chat why isn't Colton on this
monstrous chat it only happened 27
minutes ago
dicks oh I even used math alright let's
go ahead and have a look let's go ahead
and have a look at this oh oh that's not
looking pretty okay so 20% of you less
than a month ago 38% of you have
actually used it in the last week's I
spelled that wrong but that's okay I
don't actually believe that 600 of you
have HTC vive czar oculus rifts but you
know that's a whole other conversation
and more than a month ago say 42% of you
so I'm actually going to put I'm going
to put my vote in here
of less than one month so it's been more
than a week but less than a month for me
and I'm not counting actually having
someone over a little while ago and
letting them use it because I actually
didn't use it not neither I nor my son
and were the only two people who use it
have used it in the last week and it's
been almost a month for both of us so as
much as I really like it the gameplay
experiences aren't um that amazing yet
although edie has told me that there are
some pretty good games that I should try
out pretty soon he had me play some one
with him I forget what it's called it
involves magic or something and standing
on platforms yeah I forget I don't care
what it's called he kicked my ass so
hard like it was embarrassing I just I
like I play I played once with them and
in my defense I was having some issues
like I was I had to play on the rift not
the vibe because I was using like a
pre-release copy that was part of our
reviewers kit for the rift and anyway my
cameras weren't really working properly
and like half of my screen was like
going black a lot of the time like every
five to 10 seconds like in my defense it
really wasn't working correctly but but
like I would just like move to a
platform and then he'd be launching like
all these spells and crap at me and then
it would cover all my other platforms
and I couldn't move and then he would
just kill me and I was just like this is
dumb yeah yeah so basically basically
the moral of the story is that Edie is
one of those nerds who sits and don't
move that chair Edie is one of those
nerds that sits and practices mariokart
by himself so that when all of his
friends come over he can be like oh I'm
gonna hide behind this weak
justification that I wanted to unlock
all the characters but actually all he's
done is create an environment where no
one else can have any fun playing with
him because he's just he's just because
he's just a hopeless nerd
who sits in place by himself because for
him gaming is not a social experience
it's a winning experience yeah Gaming is
just a winning experience it's about
humiliation it's not about other people
having fun I mean lay back over there do
you mind double-checking the focus of
the camera - I have a question that was
how I cleverly lured him over here Thank
You ad - yes what can I do for you talk
about or the microphone is here did you
get thermals for the razorblade prolate
2016 - the GPU and CPU temperatures
because I don't have a graph for it and
John has no data there um this has
nothing to do with the wind show I'm
sorry ladies and gentlemen I apologize
thermals I don't know are they in the
folder John says he doesn't have it
where would is there a place for it to
go yeah you say it in the script what do
I say exact a thermal zuv GPU and CPU ah
and AH information ah I'm sorry ladies
and gentlemen um so that's a great
question
and I have a really good answer for you
that is that I will use my razor blade
late 2016 which I have right in front of
me and I will run a stress test right
now
Wow on the show on the show that's right
folks you are seeing live nation King
you're seeing live Korea on our live
video you are seeing us live create a
video yes my friends that is what is
going on this is how changing things get
sometimes in this moment yeah yeah well
I'm working on it thanks John while you
do that what's the next item on the
thing so I can talk about it with my
talking um I have no idea why you think
I would want you to cover the next topic
oh well because you're busy is why rekt
so hard seeing it rekt so hard cuz I'm
so bad I oh I found oh yeah I think
that's it I think that's last week oh
you should check the data why would last
weeks is B because Luke hasn't been on
the show yet alright
Tesla predicts accidents and gives a
warning before it happens I saw that
video look at this really really really
cool really cool so the original article
here is from eat
NIC's and you should definitely watch
the video here we go the new radar
technology predicts an accident here we
go it's 52 seconds long and hopefully I
don't get a copyright strike for this
basically you know your cursor arriving
oh wow okay see that's bad thing that's
going on there Wow hit the brakes
love it beautiful very unexpected thing
um honestly I wouldn't even have a ton
of faith in a in an experienced human
driver to respond that well and that
quickly to that kind of a hazard hang on
can you pull up the article again
because I don't know if that's a
prediction because what I heard was it's
actually bouncing the radar underneath
the car in front of you to see the car
in front of that car and that's the one
that it saw was hitting the brakes
really hard and so it's like oh the car
infra behind that car is not gonna be
able to break or a will and then the
third car is actually gonna hit the
thing so it didn't predict as much as be
able to see a car that the human
couldn't see yes yes that's like
predicting well that's not predicting
that's reacting very quick it's
predicting that what the human would
have been able to see oh well we'll
we'll change in some way that a human
wouldn't have been able to know I think
the word predicting here is a little bit
odd I would use fast reaction or
something anyway very cool predictive
reaction whatever TM TM predictive
reaction TM very cool someone's gonna
end up using that some car maker is
gonna have predictive reaction
technology the names they have a new RGB
right the names they have four things
just like I know I don't know well I
mean we at last what was at CES like we
saw like this whole room full of like
car self-driving stuff and it was like
all these maps and stuff and yeah there
was ridiculous names yeah for all these
things they had the sensor and they had
like rain flowing at it to show that it
can see through rain you know crazy
stuff all right so basically this is new
radar processing technology that was
pushed as an update in September under
Tesla 8.0 Elon Musk explained the
significance of the technology when it
was announced
press statement and this is a quote in
fact an additional level of
sophistication we are confident that we
can use the radar to look beyond the car
in front of you by bouncing the signal
off the road and around the car we are
able to process that echo by using the
unique signature of each radar pulse as
well as the time of flight of the photon
to determine that what we are seeing is
in fact an echo of the front of the car
that's in front of you wholly actual
balls oh are you coming back to the show
ok boy hi everyone it's not really
coming back to the show if you were
never but yeah so how's the surface
sauce to do really mostly cool watch the
review like what I did there
so left like a cliffhanger it's not a
cliffhanger
sort of not answering a question fair
you should tell the the the producers
have lost but that's how that works
that's how I just hmm that was me I
kicked a thing ok it's ok ok yep
everything is fine I was moving at the
time so trust me yeah no don't you go
get my tooth just wait we're gonna
publish our video on like the redoing of
the land show because there's actually a
whole bunch of stuff we're gonna redo it
while we're gonna redo the computer
we're gonna um sort of more formally for
you do all the captures stuff we're
gonna redo the audio we're gonna redo
the automated lighting and all that crap
and just watch the first show after we
like announce all these big improvements
I don't know haffley 5 minutes in I'm
gonna like kick a bucket on to the
computer it's gonna unplug all the
cables in little bit like all the audio
stuffs just gonna like slide off the
back the table and smash and break yes
you know one second I want to be your
twin
nothing can wait what oh ok sure yeah
the story behind the to kiss that it was
made by a fan and it matches like the
LTTE colors so I think it's super cool
and I've been wearing it this winter ok
so the original article here is from
PolitiFact
Jeff brands right I'm sorry Jeff brands
says unlike California em we in Florida
welcome driverless cars no permit really
the faint wait no what is this I walked
around it what is that what was that's
oh that's behind you oh I thought it was
the the dude yeah no he's on the thing
okay anyway um so basically here we go
uber hit the road with self-driving cars
in San Francisco in December but
california regulators quickly hit the
brakes
so in florida senator jeff brand saw an
opening hey uber unlike California we in
Florida
welcome driverless cars no permit
required hashtag open for business and
that was a tweet on December 22nd so
that's interesting that is either a very
progressive stance or a very reckless
one yeah yeah because not all driverless
car tech will be built equal no and I
personally think that some kind of
government validation there needs to be
a car by car but what's the one that
does drugs EPA
no that's environmental protect what am
i doing FDA yeah yeah yeah and the FDA
is like Mary Lee overworked and they
don't have enough time to look at
everything and that's actually like a
terrible situation and blah blah blah
but we need like a version of that for a
driverless car tech some type of
government oversight seems like a good
idea
everyone's everyone's hating on me cuz
you said EPA yeah they're like IRS DEA
thank you everybody thank you government
acronym of the G AP government acronym
police we're gonna take care of me
well switch out is that everything
police yeah so except the twitchchat
police they're fine to let that just go
to hell in a handbasket
yeah um speaking of going to hell in a
handbasket FreshBooks
if you feel like your business is going
to hell in a handbasket because you just
don't have time to can I help you well
is going to say or if you like want to
make your business around hell in a
handbasket and you want to like sell n
baskets for Halloween or something for
like gifts say someone has a birthday on
Halloween and you want to give them a
themed gift maybe you could so one out
of every three hundred and sixty-five
people
theoretically has a birthday on
Halloween which means that doing some
quick calculator math here seven billion
okay divided by 365 that gives you at am
so a total addressable market of
nineteen million one hundred and seventy
eight thousand people yeah so of which
let's say ah one 120 F of them or so are
in the United States and Canada so
divided by 20 is that how that works so
that's a million people okay ish okay a
million people in the US and Canada
approximately have a birthday on October
31st and you could let's say you sell
your gift back I'd say $19.99 $29.99 go
to $20 bill yeah it sounds good yeah
okay thank you 20 oh yeah okay so I am
estimating that your market cap is Wow
nineteen billion dollars I mean viable
business yeah
live will be based on that enough uh you
should quit here today yeah Helen
handbasket dot-com I shouldn't even have
to fire you is that a is that is that
domain taken Helena Hat I'm pretty sure
that domain is taken let's see and is
there a reason we turned off all the
lights that were eliminating us before
we sort of need those those are pretty
those are pretty useful
those lights
um so uh hell in a handbasket yeah sure
that's a little better than oh it's
taken nothing which of course it's taken
I thought I'd check okay
hell in a handbasket dog CA is not taken
so if I got just a Canadian company then
it's only ten bucks you thought we don't
pay you to think
oh well it's because we don't pay him
not because he doesn't think well huh
anyway ah fresh books so fresh Phyllis

today I prevented Taryn from breaking
your chair by the way no I'm trying to
figure why my base is so much higher
than yours because it's a completely
different chair ah okay cool it's a
bigger chair for bigger blokes
that makes sense yep I liked my basket
idea what else we told him you liked
your basket idea if I you were just
completely joking no I was okay good I
was joking about liking my basket at you
it's a horrible idea
doing themed holiday baskets okay an
entirety could be a good idea doing like
someone sketch just hell based ones
sounds a horrible idea
don't do that help a skits dot-com you
might do okay around like the launch of
Diablo for whenever that happens and
that's it a fib that you're screwed yeah
based on how often Blizzard launches a
Diablo title it's gonna be a feast or
famine type of yeah you're doing pretty
bad is hell baskets calm taken hold on
wait for it is it taking so long wait
for it wait for it wait for it come on
oh my goodness wow your search is
terrible I believe in you GoDaddy you
can find it okay I don't really believe
in you Wow probably find it oh man no
this is solid there's a chance you can
find it yeah you know what's really
funny is I thought a little while ago we
were looking for domains for our online
video streaming platform that we're sort
of building now because Yolo rip this
whole I guess oh you have your vessel
too yeah nice yeah I couldn't find my
orange one you should come to YouTube
I'm one but to bring mine I have mine
too oh my Pole yeah I posted a picture
of it in the right chat yeah I sold my
vessel shirt and my vessel too cuz
there's so much cool in it
I know right you are so much cooler such
a hipster way of thinking yeah but it is
so true it is um yeah anyway but what we
were talking about right cuz like right
cuz we have to build a we have to build
a video streaming platform now so we
were looking at domains and I thought Go
Daddy was throttling us for like
searching too many too quickly like I
thought they thought we were a bot or
something no way my god hell baskets is
available right now hell baskets calm
I'm buying it I'm buying hell baskets
dong-ha right now because it's amazing
who would not want hell baskets dot-com
I'm gonna verify that he actually goes
through with it oh he obviously can't
show the like checkout process because
it would show all the things that are
important oh I am I am I am buying hell
baskets calm so hard right now so what
someone's gonna maybe try to snipe it
before you can try and snipe but I am I
am armed jeez all right I am armed with
uh-oh
oh no my to factor what effect the
slowest version of two-factor you it's
gonna slow it down yeah we can't talk
about it but our to factor is like dang
KF it's secure yeah
it's def secure it's definitely that
it's uh oh bloody hell I don't
I don't remember can you I think that's
the wrong one isn't it yeah no no this
is the right one for that account okay
but I instead do you remember it I think
so oops no no it's just very laggy oh
there's still a character in uh what did
you do oh I don't even know what you did
but I I am - factoring this this biatch
your two-step code - factor is such a
pain in the patoot a good worth it
valuable pain in the patoot what it is
still technically a pain in the patoot
while he's doing this I'm gonna kill
time with some Japanese topic
self-promotion I'm doing a
end-of-the-year charity stream thing my
twitch stream has raised all together
through two main events and just through
doing it throughout the entire year
about sixteen thousand two hundred
dollars a little bit lower than that
it's like sixteen thousand one hundred
and sixty eight I think so we're doing a
stream tonight starting at whenever I'm
home and ready because I never give a
guaranteed time for wine show days and
we're going to shoot for twenty thousand
dollars it is for extra life which is a
Children's Hospital charity kind of
thing if you don't know what extra life
is check that out you can go to extra
life calm slash Luke to see my team I
don't know how I got that URL but I did
so it's pretty awesome
but yeah we're going for 20k tonight I
mean
be doing who I'm gonna be doing a 24
hour stream and doing one game every two
hours I ended up deciding on 12 games
instead of 24 and then we have we're
giving away like a huge amount of games
I think tre is coming up with like a
hundred and fifty games that he's giving
away during the streams No someone got
it no way so much check it the basket
contains two domains that are
unavailable those domains have been
removed you bastard who got it you
bastard
I was buying hell baskets calm you're
terrible who got it I want to know who
got it
they're foods they're bad they're a bad
person who doesn't use to factor
apparently or at least not the slowest
to factor in the world one named bad
karma claimed to have got it yeah but
it's twitch chat so like yeah it's a
good bad karma twitch commenter could be
someone most proof that you got it yeah
I want to see proof or I don't buy it I
don't buy it
he'll bat and like tweet it to me
because the twitch chat is going far too
bad you can tweet it to the official -
tech tips account anyway what was the
story right I was as I was I thought
that they were throttling but maybe
they're just slow that was just that was
the little story that was the point of
the story and then I wanted held a skits
calm and I couldn't even I couldn't even
manage that today what a crap day um
should we so amazed that's what I'm kind
of sad cuz that's actually really cool
domain I'm amazed that it wasn't taken
hell baskets like it just well it's a
cool sounding domain it's like I don't
know what the hell I did put on there ya
go nothing but whatever people are
spamming yeaaaah so links um alright our
next article is uh what's up hmm yeah
there it is there it is who's it from
who God I'm not sure cuz a whole bunch
of people are posting the link oh great
is there already something parked on
there
couldn't be couldn't be up that fast
hahaha redirects to the forum that was
so fast
hell no come no dude for me did you put
in www nope just help acid saw Tom dock
home hell basket aches at Debbie WWE
yeah well I thought so but what it works
for me I don't know bra do be happier AC
hold on hold on do we have your screen
share working right now no I can steal
your cable steal my cable okay okay here
I mean we can't we can't talk about this
unless we're gonna offer proof right
yeah here you go
cable cable in yeah thank you all right
well I'm like I'm still setting it up
you missing key you got this you got
this bra hell baskets calm okay terrible
we might be ready okay alright hit me
domaine bar I'm not sending good domain
bar hell bastards calm you can see that
yeah do it
enter well it's the forum know another
tab enter loads the forum I'm telling
you man he directed that fast like
really fast
wow that was legendary alright so there
you have you um yeah for spending $20 on
a very strange domain that never eater X
I love that okay so do you have a very
funny community sometimes yeah it's like
the kind of stuff that they think is
funny like I'm gonna buy a domain joke's
on you it's gonna drive extra traffic to
you oh I love you guys okay epic
speaking of love AMD oh my there may be
something to love ya about AMD Rison is
it rising arisen rights risin know they
say rising in their presentations I'm
going to rise okay risin yeah video this
is from Digital Trends calm oh wait what
oh it's what it shows kind of a oh yeah
sorry
it shows kind of a code name when you
look at it in like the benchmark it says
am d2 d3 1 v 1 a to m88 e but like and
that's not here anywhere if it's
performing that well then whatever no
worries apparently it has 100 68.7%
performance of the provided core i5 6600
k ah so that would put it like well
above a 6700 K apparently only the 69
hundred K is shown performing out
outperforming the rising chip so the 69
hundred K is an 8 core no 6 core can't
remember I'm Jesse I'm just terrible at
all this stuff previously I'm pretty
sure it's an 8 core yeah today core
right yeah I think so
like I'm yeah other see cards okay good
I was right the first time so that's a
three point two to three point seven
boost with a max boost of four gigahertz
140 watt TDP eight core from Intel that
AMD Rison is not able to beat mind you
that's a thousand dollar chip so if AMD
were to come in even at like $5.99
which would get them a pretty good
return on their investment in the
silicon um we could be looking at an
actual race and that's and that's like
the first time in a very long time a big
TDP benefit to which is not something
that in AMD usually gets over em don't
see I hate it when people do this
I hate generalizations you can't say AMD
usually because you have to evaluate
product by product because there have
been time
in the past when AMD's thermal but more
often than usually does apply problem
okay but that's more like historically
than usually I think they both work so
historically AMD has not been known for
their superior performance per watt yeah
versus Intel yeah okay but okay so how
do I explain usually versus historically
I'm sure twitch chat doesn't care um but
you know what okay fine fine the point
is generalizations are bad you have to
look at every product as an individual
product in the tech space because it is
not as simple as like Nvidia cards run
hot AMD drivers are bad Intel chips are
overpriced probably soon I know but this
is a word of warning to everybody these
kinds of generalizations are what lead
to fanboy ISM because at some point in
history every single one of those
statements I've made has been reversed
has been true or has been not true every
single one of them I did put a lot of
care on to the word usually one other
thing do we look better today is that a
new lens no it's just the lighting is
porked do you notice there's no light in
front of us but we look better depth of
fielded than we normally do do we not
you look sharper I think it's just the
the fact that there's lighting in the
background well so it comes off the back
of our heads like this maybe yeah it's
like that yeah I know the lighting is
broken yeah anyway so so the power
consumption tests show this chip pulling
93 watts an AMD claimed a 95 watt TDP at
their launch event which are which would
be very competitive with the 140 watt
rated TDP of Intel's chip with that said
Intel's TDP SR a big load of bollocks
because all they do is say okay well
this is a thermal design envelope like
that is the maximum for this entire
range of CPUs that go all the way from
like 6 cores to 10 and they're all 140
watt don't worry about it
so we'll see thermals and power
when we test it in house yeah again you
have to evaluate chip by chip in those
cases no let's just read off of Intel
spec sheet because everything from the
6800 K to the 69 50x has a hundred and
forty watt TDP but it's still exciting
and this is really really exciting and
so this was actually leaked by a Reddit
user from a French hardware magazine
meaning that maybe it's not just AMD
numbers maybe these are third-party
numbers that are actually being run and
maybe there's something to this which
hopefully and it says it in here but
hopefully it was actually true the power
consumption test showed the chip itself
only pulling 93 watts which is not that
bad
speaking of not that bad if you believe
that fake news is a problem which I
would hope that most people would agree
on that it's a problem even if we can't
necessarily agree on what the correct
solution is because I can see a lot of
people going well who's the fake news
police who decides news is fake what's
the difference between fake and satire
that one's confusing just like what
happens to the onion can an opinion be
false like oh you know if all of a
sudden you just have to start going you
know let's put together an opinion based
you know news story in my opinion you
know Bernie Sanders slept with a donkey
it's like is that news if it's an
opinion would that be allowed to be
posted as news what if it was on a news
site I don't think that's how you'd be
able to say it look good but the point
is like there's a very that we can all
agree that the lines in the sand are not
very cleaving something at having an
opinion something different because I
think you'd have to say I believe that
he did not I have in my opinion he did
um I think I think there's sort of two
sides of this very similar coin so so in
much the same way that you would say
allegedly if a source has been confirmed
um yeah so if everything was allegedly
you know allegedly this happened and it
allegedly dot-com yeah who'd you hear it
from like my neighbors the fastest my
neighbor who says whatever I tell him to
say alleged
um anyway okay so we can't it's not
simple how to get rid of fake news but I
hope we can all agree that non factual
news designed to mislead people is a
problem that should be addressed so
Germany's solution is apparently they're
considering this just to find the trash
out of them is to find facebook half a
million dollars per fake news item per
day that they do not pull it down from
the site per day that's awesome that's a
lot of money yeah like doesn't make
sense this we can afford it
um yes I yes soon um yeah so in hand
jesters I like this do we have any more
any more details about this so the
German government will consider the bill
next year and it would allow both
official and private complainants to
flag content that is in sitting on fake
news that's going to be a disaster the
law would also for social networks to
create in country offices focused on
responding to takedown demands Wow
lawmakers believe they believe in their
opinion this bill will help tackle the
possibility of Russia meddling in
parliamentary elections scheduled for
next year this follows allegations that
the Kremlin was behind the hacking of
the Democratic National Committee that
led to the leak of thousands of emails
by key aides to Hillary Clinton
fascinating hmm I guess moving on yeah I
guess so Thermaltake made an RGB power
supply what is this new I don't actually
think so but I don't really care it's
adorable there you go there's the
article on new at all on uh like maybe
this protects our spy is new but like
it's fully modular low ripple noise
smart zero fan 100% Japanese capacitors
and a 10 year warranty power supplies
with ten year warranties man Kelly can
you imagine using a power supply today
that you bought in 2006
yeah totally I do you do yeah
2006 that was a long time ago dude
things about 2006 against Iran yeah yeah
you know the mineral ring
I still use all those components Emma
played starting Valley on them literally
last night
that's about 2006 yeah that's like an H
X 5 20 or something like that if I
recall correctly still works huh I don't
know if I would use all of them for that
long right but that power supply seems
to have been rather stable yeah CH X is
a good person
yeah yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't yeah
there's a lot of power supplies to be
clear that I wouldn't use them for that
huh
all right the original article here is
on the verge and it's exciting what's
that what's an tech 1,000 watt HX no
light what no antic what is it HP some
ah HDCP yeah yeah that one the 1200 watt
yeah it's still working in my system I
thought it died it was something that's
not as old that's like 5 years old
whereas it your HX is like almost 10
years old yeah yeah Twitter wants to
make tweets editable but it's
complicated why why is it complicated
let's find out why it's complicated um
so CEO Jack Dorsey is polling Twitter
users on what features they'd like to
see from the company in 2017 he believes
a form of edit is needed but not for
everyone
honestly here's one objection so so
strong argument for allowing tweets to
be edited I can go against as well I can
I can fix the sever pet typo in my tweet
last night yeah where I referred to our
server as a sever which it is not yeah I
do that kind of stuff all the time
the counter-argument is that you can say
something start a whole bunch of crap
with people respond to you and then just
change it and be like haha but like I
think the Internet has figured that out
at this point have they have they really
because
right now just show edit history well
right now Twitter serves oh okay so
showing it at history but if they show
edit history like whatever platform
works like that like our forum doesn't
show an edit history you can see that it
was edited monitoring moderators yes you
can see that it is edited and you cannot
remove the flag that it was edited okay
so like I think that would just like if
people start freaking out
people are just point out like yeah I
was edited so whatever and then just if
you're tweeting something super
important don't edit it post it and then
if it's that terrible delete it repost
it again because we have to do right now
fair enough okay that makes sense so
basically there's a series of tweets so
there's one asking whether to fix at
it's quick or edit any time because
that's something that you could do you
could allow it to be edited in the first
five minutes yeah that would fix the
vast majority of my problems yeah I have
me too
apparently there's a big difference in
the implementation because allowing to
edit anytime requires change log as
we're often the public record so that's
a very good point and that Twitter is
often like you look at all the fact
checking that was done during the during
the US election for example where I
candidate might say something like I
never said this and then it was as
simple as going back and going well your
Twitter account which you haven't said
was hacked at any point in time has a
completely different thing so and with
how big your Twitter account and
following is and all I kind of stuff I'm
pretty sure you'd respond real fast if
it got hacked yeah so yeah not that that
seemed to matter to most people no
okay wow that's really boring news and
about it that's really boring news we're
gonna see yes and we're going to see yes
yeah and I got some videos to shoot
before I go to CES one of them is gonna
be a us exciting dongle roundup so many
dolls which dongle is the best dongle
who's Tonga will reign supreme
can i Dunga you later sure anytime
only if it's the best dongle intro dude
dude dude through still nighttime audio
no we don't have audio dude dude dude
the doctor why don't we have audio but
there's this little problem okay we just
solve it pretty easy yeah duh sort of
yes duh yeah it's like Twitter it's
complicated come check out my charity
stream and not wait too long fresh bucks
huh yeah Chris Berg Oh are we set up to
do an show like remotely do we have all
the files and stuff we should probably
do that at some point I probably should</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
