of the Intel Core i7 2670 me some of the
other members of the new updated Core i5
and core i7 family on the LGA 1155
socket so this guy right here this is
the 2600 the 2600 has something kind of
unique about it and that is that it is
the highest clocked Intel Core i7 CPU on
this platform it features hyper
threading turbo boost it has a full
eight Meg cache but but it is not quite
the highest-end processor in this series
the 2600 K which I've unboxed already
has a couple of advantages it is
unlocked and Unleashed which means it
has an unlocked multiplier for maximum
overclocking and the K series processor
also features Intel HD graphics 3000
series versus Intel HD graphics 2000
series now that's not to say the 2600
can't be overclocked at all you can
overclock it up to I believe it is eight
speed bins over the stock 3.4 gigahertz
frequency so that means you can go up to
4.2 gigahertz okay so that's not too bad
but these K series chips are typically
able to reach 4.7 and even higher with
only modest aftermarket cooling so let's
get this one opened up it is a 95 watt
TDP part I don't think we're going to
see any higher TDP parts on the LGA 1155
socket because on Intel's roadmap there
is an LG 8 2011 that is an eye on eclis
or ironically not sure which going to be
released in 2011 so the first thing we
find inside is an Intel Core i7 sticker
as well as installation instructions and
a three year limited warranty the next
thing we find in the eco-friendly
packaging here that is made of cardboard
is a stop cooler now it's a very weak
stock cooler I would definitely
recommend upgrading to something a
little bit more robust and I'll let the
cameraman
they're at that cooler and show you guys
that while I go and grab something that
I think would be a more appropriate
heatsink for this little chip this right
here is the Corsair a7 deal though I
only have one fan on it and this is
definitely I mean come on this is the
special mass and heat pipes alone is
probably more than this entire cooler
waves fan and all so you can imagine
that especially if you're overclock and
you're going to be able to dissipate
more heat it's going to run quieter etc
etc this thing's pretty weak does come
with pre applied thermal compound and a
popper slug in the middle as well as
what appears to be a 92 millimeter no I
think that's an 80 millimeter PWM
controlled fan now let's have a look at
the CPU itself now the CPU comes out
just like this from there pull this out
and the CPU and it's little plastic
clamshell looks a little something like
that so as I mentioned before this is
nearly identical to the 2600 k so it's
the same clock speed same cache the only
performance difference you're going to
see on this chip is on the onboard
graphics which you're only going to be
using on an H 67 chipset or AC 68
chipset not on P 67 because it doesn't
support onboard graphics and then also
if you are overclocking so if you're
adding a big aftermarket cooler and
overclocking spring for the extra couple
bucks for the K series chip thank you
