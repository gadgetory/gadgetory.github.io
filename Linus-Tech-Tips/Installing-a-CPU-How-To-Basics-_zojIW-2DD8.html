so it's easy for us to forget that many
viewers may be encountering the world of
PC building for the first time and while
there's lots of great PC building
tutorials out there there are also some
that verge on misinformation so in this
video we are going back to basics with
episode 2 of how to basics installing a
CPU
the hex gears impulse mechanical
keyboard comes with RGB lighting and IP
56 water resistance so in the event that
you do spill on your keyboard
yes shouldn't even need to interrupt
your game check it out at the link below
so let's start then from the very
beginning it's a good place to start
what do you install the CPU into the CPU
socket where's the socket on the
motherboard where's the motherboard well
here's where we get to step 1 on top of
a non metal non conductive surface like
the box that it came in now if you don't
have the motherboard you're gonna want
to go back a few steps and pick one of
those up first that's pretty important
now there are two main types of CPU
sockets that you should probably know
about in 2019 and actually for years to
come
LG a style sockets and PGA style sockets
Intel primarily uses land grid array or
LG ace
meaning that the socket itself is made
up of a grid of pins so these touch
gold-plated flat contacts or pads on the
bottom of the CPU and that is what
allows your PC to run all of your
spreadsheet simulators AMD on the other
hand uses more commonly a pin grid array
or PGA configuration that means that the
pins are on the CPU instead of on the
socket so PGA sockets are simply a grid
of holes that the CPU drops into with no
force required now this makes it much
safer to handle the motherboard without
worrying about damaging the pins which
can be pretty much the end of your CPU
installation endeavor but it also means
that you have to be extra careful with
the CPU Intel actually originally used
PGA's but they switch to LGA around 2002
presumably because processors are
generally more expensive than
motherboards and if you're going to
accidentally bend or break a pin you
want your new paperweight to be as cheap
as possible with that said it's not
impossible to repair socket pins it's
just extremely difficult and extremely
easy to cause even further damage to
other pins while you try to fix the one
that's bent so your best bet is to send
it to an experienced technician if you
run into this no pressure but anyway you
aren't just concerned with the type of
socket but also the number of pins so
Intel's main consumer socket LGA 1151
has 1151 pins while they're 2066 socket
which is geared more towards enthusiasts
has 2066 pins on the AMD side a m4 has
1331 so if AMD was using the same naming
scheme as Intel it would be pga 1331 i
guess and then there tr4 socket which is
actually an LGA well that one has 4,000
94 pins which is where things get pretty
confusing because sometimes AMD does use
LG ace now some of these sockets have
been around for a few years and may
continue to be used by Intel and AMD so
something you need to note is that just
because a CPU physically fits into a
particular socket does not necessarily
mean it will be compatible and this was
a lesson that Riley who prepared this
episode learned all too well in our
cheapest Amazon PC video now sockets are
different from chipsets a specific
configuration of hardware and software
that allows the processor memory and the
peripherals in a system to communicate
with each other processors often launch
alongside compatible chipsets but
sometimes they'll be forwards or
backwards compatible with the next or
previous generation the thing though is
this might require a BIOS update in
order to work so you will need to
consult your motherboard manufacturers
website in order to know 100% for sure
which CPUs work in which motherboards
and if a BIOS update is required okay so
now that we've done our homework we know
our processors compatible with our
motherboard it's time to drop that
sucker in except don't actually drop it
because
as I said the pins regardless of what
they're attached to are extremely
fragile and susceptible to damage
now these following steps apply broadly
to both of Intel sockets and to AMD's a
m4 socket while tr4 AMD's enthusiasts
socket for thread Ripper does do things
a little bit differently
before you begin you're gonna want to
grab an anti-static wrist strap that's
connected to a ground or you're going to
want to keep your feet stationary and
touch a metal part of your case or power
supply with your power supply plugged
into the wall to discharge any static
buildup on your body now if you're
upgrading your CPU on an existing system
the first thing you're going to need to
do is unplug your CPUs cooler so find
where the fan cable plugs into the
header on the motherboard and just pull
it off for Intel systems it's pretty
common to see these two lists plastic
pins installed around the socket simply
rotate them in the direction indicated
pop them open and pull the CPU cooler
off on the AMD side of things you should
find a little lever like this on one
side of the processor socket pull it up
and the latches on either side of your
CPU should loosen so you can pull them
off the little hooks on the side and
remove the cooler be careful though it's
not uncommon for the CPU to get pulled
off with the heatsink exposing its
fragile pins it's not a huge problem as
long as you don't bend anything though
if you're doing a new installation
rather than upgrading though Intel LGA
sockets will have a socket cover in
place
leave this where it is is it will come
off by itself when you lock in the CPU
instead lift up the retention arm or
arms on the side of the socket this will
allow you to lift up the socket lid next
hold your processor being careful to
only touch the edges if you touch the
contacts on the bottom not only can this
interfere with electrical contact but it
can actually cause corrosion over the
long term next look for an arrow in one
corner of the CPU this will line up with
a similar mark
on one of the corners of the socket
there may also by the way be notches on
the sides of the CPU these should line
up with tiny nubbins in the side of the
socket if you're not a hundred percent
sure about your arrows once you've
determined the correct orientation lower
the CPU into the socket gently there's
no need to push or apply any force
though I do recommend giving it a tiny
wiggle just to make sure that it's
seated properly and to let it know that
you still love it no matter what next
lower the socket lid over the CPU making
sure that it fits back under the screw
or bracket that held it in originally
then push the retention arm down and
under the hook so it stays into place if
you've got two arms
they'll be designed so that one goes
down first and then the other just like
this now that process is pretty similar
for most consumer boards and CPUs for
the last ten almost 20 years but AMD's
TR for socket that one's a little more
involved your thread Ripper CPU will
actually come with the Torx screwdriver
that you need to install it first loosen
the three screws holding down the socket
lid it'll say which order to loosen them
in so don't just unscrew them all
willy-nilly once you've got them
loosened those screws will stay inside
the socket lid which will pop up on its
own because it's spring-loaded
so that's pretty fun under the lid you
will find another lid which has a
plastic tray inside lift this lid up
holding it by the sides then slide the
plastic tray upward and then put it away
to the side next is the actual socket
cover which protects the pins we're just
going to leave that there for the moment
now thread Ripper CPUs come
pre-installed into an orange plastic
housing do not try to remove it it is
supposed to be there holding it by the
tab on one side slide the CPU into the
rails in that second lid with the bottom
facing the socket until it kind of
clicks into place
then you can remove the socket cover
from the actual pins by pinching the
grab points in the middle and then lower
the second lid containing the CPU now on
to the socket gently push and it will
secure itself into place at which point
you can then lower the first lid and
start screwing the screws back into
place now that Torx screwdriver that's
included is designed specifically for
these screws so once they're threaded in
a little you can tighten them in the
order that's specified on the socket lid
until the tool clicks and that's it your
CPU is installed but it won't last very
long without a CPU cooler now if you
have a third party cooler that's
probably gonna come with its own
instructions detailing how exactly to
mount it if it has no pre applied
thermal paste you're going to need to
add your own to the top of the CPU
before installing just remember guys
that when it comes to thermal paste less
is more you only need to fill the small
imperfections between the CPU and the
heatsink there's no mystical pentagram
of thermal paste required to summon the
PC Gamer gods that's only gonna end up
with a whole bunch of thermal compound
all over your motherboard which probably
won't damage it but it'll be really
messy to clean up gamers Nexus as mod
matte actually has a great guide for how
to apply thermal compound to most modern
CPUs so consumer chips just the small
ones a simple line down the middle is
perfect for Intel enthusiasts CPUs for
smaller dots in each corner will do your
wonders and for thread Ripper you want
to make an X with four dots in between
the lines to help fill in the gaps the
thing is that the larger the actual CPU
die under the heat spreader on top is
the more thermal compound you need to
make sure that you get full coverage
because any die area that doesn't have
thermal compound is going to result in
hot spots on your CPU which at the very
least can limit your overclocking
potential now main line processors
usually come with the cooler while
enthusiast ones sometimes do not now
many coolers come with pre-installed
thermal paste on the bottom in which
case there's no need for extra if you do
have a stock cooler
simply line up the four mounting pins
with the four holes on the motherboard
socket if you're using it by the way you
will need to reset those pins back to
their original location and then push
down on the opposing sets of pins until
they click into place as for AMD it's
the same process in Reverse from removal
where we simply hook the side of the
cooler without the latch first then the
latch side and close the arm now it can
sometimes take a little bit of force but
if you feel like you're overdoing it
then you should probably check the
bottom side and make sure that nothing's
interfering after your cooler is secured
you can connect your fan plug in to the
closest four pin header on your
motherboard which will usually be
clearly labeled CPU fan now that we've
got our CPU installed we could just say
ah that's great let's call it a day but
we won't because we're professional
technicians it's good practice to make
sure that your CPU is actually seated
correctly and just because the system
boots doesn't mean that it is so you're
gonna want to go into your motherboards
BIOS which is normally accessed by
pressing delete or f2 when you first
power on your system to make sure that
all of your RAM sticks show up it is
very common especially on thread Ripper
CPUs for some of the pins to not make
perfect contact which can cause one or
more of your memory slots not to
function correctly if you do run into
this it's okay probably nothing is
damaged just go ahead and take it out
reinstall it and try again and then
that's really it your CPUs installed the
brain of your system some might call it
treat it well my friends treat it well

long but I'm gonna save you guys some
