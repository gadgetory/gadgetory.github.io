I don't know if I've mentioned this on
my video blog before but I'm a big fan
of gelid wing fans I really really like
them they undervolt extremely well which
is to say they don't tick or hum when
you turn down the voltage to get them to
quiet down and they're also reasonably
quiet when they are running at full
speed so this is a new updated version
of the gelug wing this is the wing PL
series which means that it is a pwm fan
we have the LED so it has all kinds of
cool features so PWM control and LED
light nano flux bearing so a PWM control
means is that your lights won't get more
dim when you when you lower the voltage
or rather when you lower the speed if
you use PWM control you can still use
voltage control on a PWM fan it's just I
mean you dropped a feature that you
might as well use it so here's some UV
reactive fan mounts all right so I'll
show you those under UV light in just a
moment and then here is the fan with the
UV reactive blades as well as white LEDs
mounted in the housing so you can see
where the LEDs are mounted behind the
fan so I'm just gonna kick her into the
other room here where I have my computer
set up with there's a cat you know
that's right you move however I have my
computer set up we have UV lights inside
it so you can see I got my my wing 90
millimeter as well as my wing 120
millimeter fans up in the top there
those are not spinning for a reason it's
my fan controller that turn them off so
there's the UV reactive pendants that
would be kind of a neat neat way to
mount these instead of the black ones
that I have in there now maybe I should
try and get my hands on some blue ones
of these those are nice and then here is
the the UV reactive green fan so once I
put it in there it glows that's why I
have these purple lights for those of
you who don't know how UV works and no
regular cathode lights like white blue
red they will not make stuff glow like
this you have to use UV in order to get
this effect which I personally really
like but it's not for everyone so hold
on give me two seconds I'm just going
to adjust my camera let's say I can kind
of point it out what I'm doing here
I just want to plug this fan into my
motherboard so that I can show you guys
what it looks like with the LEDs lit and
I have no idea what that's going to look
like so we're all gonna find out
together because that's the beauty of
this channel I'm scripted uncensored
unprofessional sometimes but what are
you gonna do so there you have it that
is the white LEDs on the fan so
basically it's kind of like the glow is
very similar to what you get from the UV
but you can see now the UV light is
completely unnecessary so for someone
like me who's using UV in their rig for
a more subtle lighting effect versus
bright LEDs I would probably stick with
the regular wing series fans you can see
how bright that makes the inside and
it's really going to diminish the UV
effect on on anything else because one
of the disadvantages of UV is that as
soon as you introduce any other light
sources you're going to really really
cut down on that glowing effect so you
can see it glows pretty freely by itself
but you go ahead and you put like a
bright light source next to it and that
glow is gonna be really reduced I don't
know how well you can guys can see this
but there's only so much I can do so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first impressions of the gelid
winged 12 PL fan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
