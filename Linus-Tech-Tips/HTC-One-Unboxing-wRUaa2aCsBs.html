welcome to my unboxing and first look at
the HTC one now we've already seen a 1x
and a 1s and a 1x plus but this is just
one that's all there is to it so they
have gone instead of sort of a hedged
BET's multi-tiered phone strategy and
they're saying ok nope this is it this
is gonna incorporate all of the best
technology that we can build the shell
itself so the aluminum frame the
aluminum body that it uses has 200
minutes minimum on a machine for each
individual phone that's produced so to
put this in the appropriate context
those machines cost tens of thousands of
dollars potentially for high-end CNC
machines and they are occupying 200
minutes each they had to put a bunch of
advanced technique techniques into it
just to manufacture this thing so I'm
gonna go ahead and put it down here and
we're gonna start actually I'm not gonna
put it down here we're gonna start with
a size comparison so compared to the HTC
8x it is actually a very similar size in
spite of the fact that the screen is a
little bit larger at 4.7 inches so if I
go ahead and turn it on so I'm just
gonna try and get an HTC logo on the
screens here there we go you'll see it
goes a little bit closer to the edge
there's the sound when it boots up then
the 8x so that's a Windows Phone this is
an Android phone and it runs HTC's Sense
5.0 alright so by comparison here's a
Galaxy Note 2 we should probably also do
thickness comparisons here as well I'm
not going to put it quite up against the
other phone because this is Diesel's and
I'm sure he'd freak out if he saw me
doing that so it's much smaller than a
note 2 however the resolution is
actually higher this is a 1080p Super
LCD 3 phone now I've seen Super LCD 2
and Super LCD 3 this is a galaxy s3 by
the way guys the s4 is a little bit
bigger also has a 1080p screen and Super
LCD 3 is out
absolutely better than Super LCD -
especially with respect to color shift
so they both have pretty vibrant colors
good text all that stuff here's an
iPhone 4 by the way guys there's a size
comparison there but Super LCD 3 doesn't
really shift the colors as you move
around and look at it from different
angles up and down so here's is a 1s so
that's a previous generation phone not
quite a flagship like the Droid DNA so
this is only one of the first one of the
first two or three phones on the market
that has a 1080p display it also has the
all new Snapdragon
s600 platform so that includes a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core processor wireless
AC and Adreno 320 GPU as well as 2 gigs
of memory so we're into the setup wizard
so I'm going to go ahead and get that
started and we'll be back in a moment so
now let's take a really close look at
the phone itself there are a few things
about it that are particularly
innovative so number one is I'm gonna
take it I'm gonna hold it in portrait
that I'm gonna go BAM landscape because
these two speakers right here are stereo
speakers with what HTC is calling boom
sound so boom sound is pretty much their
way of saying it actually has sound that
will actually be usable in the context
of sitting and looking at your phone
like this I'm watching a movie for
example this makes perfect sense because
if you look at something like an iPhone
4 which has one port for audio that
comes out of the bottom or even
something like an 8x that has one
speaker on the back of the phone how
many times have you done this where
you're cupping your hand behind the
phone in order to direct any noise at
your face so boom sound looks incredibly
cool they've also added a 1080p
front-facing camera in addition so
that's a 2.1 megapixel still 1080p 30fps
video camera in addition to the four
megapixel 1080p 30fps rear camera so
hold on a minute why did I just say four
megapixel they're calling this ultra
pixel so rather than having lots of tiny
tiny micro dense dense pixels what HTC
has gone totally in the opposite
direction of the regular industry trend
and gonna
you know we're gonna put bigger pixels
in the phone because those will actually
be able to capture more light because
they're larger and should give you
better low-light performance and from
what I've seen sort of looking around so
far it's actually working so in spite of
fewer pixels you're able to get better
dynamic range and oh yeah so it's got a
1/3 inch sensor as well as an F 2.0 lens
that gives you more light transmission
and a larger sensor to capture the light
on as well so this is a very different
way of going about it in fact if you
look at H teeth the HTC one product page
on HTC's website you'll see that they
don't even list how many megapixels it
is because they feel it shouldn't be
about that it should be about what
actual quality are you getting out of
the images you're taking now one of the
other things that's changed about the
front here is that instead of having
three buttons there are two buttons so
there's a back button and a home button
instead of a recent app button you can
double click the home button to access
your recent apps and then you can hold
it down to get to Google now so that's
the way that that functionality is
enabled but so it's a little bit
different there's also added their HTC
Sense 5.0 UI so if there are there are
some intricacies to it it works well
with the apps that they include so
another thing they've changed about the
camera is you can use a mode called zou
0e in order to take about four or five
stills as well as a several second 1080p
video so part of their their whole thing
here is they want it to be more like
sort of like a Harry Potter type picture
so you're capturing a moment as opposed
to just as still so they've included a
management application a gallery for it
but it's a very cool concept I haven't
tried it yet but it sounds neat so
instead of just taking a picture you get
a little bit of the lead up you get the
smile and then you get a little bit of
whatever it happens to be very very neat
stuff so let's keep moving around the
phone on this side we find not a whole
lot just a spot for a micro sim other
than that you can see just the beautiful
finishing on the phone with the aluminum
backing as well as the beveled aluminum
front that meets seamlessly with the
Gorilla Glass 2 front so it should be
extremely durable and it looks fairly
drop resistant as well because the glass
doesn't go right to the edge there is a
little bit of a buffer zone although
that's not to say that if you drop it
directly
the glass that wouldn't break on the top
we find a headphone microphone combo
Jack as well as check this out so the
power button is not only a power button
but also an IR emitter and receiver so
you can use it as a universal remote
with any infrared devices very very cool
little innovation and it doesn't detract
from the overall look of the device
either on this side we find a volume
rocker and what I like about it is it's
a little bit it's got it's flush at or
slightly recessed so when you pick up
the phone because it's a little bit
wider here at the at the back of it you
can pick it up easily without
accidentally triggering the volume
buttons which is a problem that I had
with the 8x during my 30-day windows
phone trial on the bottom we find a USB
/mh l port so that allows it to also
output HDMI signals to compatible MHL
devices finally there's a little uh oh
sorry there sighs nope that's it there's
on the back a little noise cancelling
microphone and an overall very
symmetrical looking design this is a
solid piece of aluminum back here and
you've got a couple of cool things so
there's a flash right next to that
camera I've talked a lot about before as
well as a little Beats Audio logo and an
HTC logo now the Beats Audio logo maybe
this is part of just the the general I
don't know if it's Beats Audio or just
part of HTC's internal direction but the
audio is significantly better on the
device than what you'll find on a
typical smartphone whether that's the
headphones which have a reasonable
headphone amp on them which is great but
also those front-facing speakers that I
talked about before accessory wise they
also include a bit of a more premium
looking headphone headset than you're
generally used to seeing so it's got a
non tangle cable it's got a red and
black color scheme where have we seen
that before guys and of course it
includes three different sizes of ear
tips they are I am so they're meant to
go right into the ear canals they also
include at least with our demo model not
to say the retail one won't have more
stuff a SIM card tool as well as a micro
USB cable charger and a cable and a
charger alright so this will be the shop
where I finish up with all the little
other little things that I forgot so for
one thing it's got a 468 pixel per inch
density this is pretty much the more I
believe this is the mole
dense display on the market for a
smartphone because it is a slightly
smaller screen than there was on the
Droid DNA it's only 4.7 inch making it a
little bit easier for someone like me to
use in spite of my small hand syndrome
I'd say already that just because of the
shape of it it's easier to hold on to
than the 8x was so since this is the
device I'll be using for my 30-day
Android
I switched trial I'm really glad that
that's something that I discovered about
it on the back this isn't something you
can see but it does have NFC so you can
easily exchange data apps or whatever
else you want however there is no
wireless charging built into this phone
for those of you who were hoping to see
that option you pretty much cannot open
it up it has a 2300 milliamp hour
battery though so hopefully that's
enough for you and same thing with
respect to not being able to open it up
you can't add a micro SD card for more
expansion so you're gonna be stuck with
either the 32 gigs or 64 gigs that were
included with your phone
it comes with Android 4.1.2 but it is
upgradable to 4.2 and they include the
HTC Sync manager to facilitate moving
whether it's from iOS or from another
Android device to this new platform and
I think that pretty much wraps it up for
this unboxing and first look thank you
