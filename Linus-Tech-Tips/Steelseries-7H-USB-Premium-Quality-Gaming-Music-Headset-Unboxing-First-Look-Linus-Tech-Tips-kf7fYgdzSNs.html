lot of buzz about online this is the
SteelSeries 7h a USB pro gaming headset
and what SteelSeries is going after with
this particular headset is something
that is not only great for gaming like
there are old top-of-the-range the 5 hv
2 but also outstanding for music movies
or any other use that you could want
from them so this is their highest end
headset to date and it is also their
most expensive it's available in both a
USB and non USB version the headsets are
identical in both of those packages
however and the only difference is
whether or not it has the included
SteelSeries USB soundcard so if I could
get the cameraman to come and have a
look I'm just gonna show you what
SteelSeries has to say for themselves
about this particular headset so here
they show you the specifications so if
you just want to zoom in on that so they
can read it as long as it's focused it's
good because they can pause and then
hear there's a bunch of information
about it as well and then let's flip
around to the back so this headset does
feature 50 millimeter drivers so that's
quite large for a PC gaming headset it
is a closed type headset but the
interchangeable ear cushions and I'm
going to just start unboxing the headset
itself the interchangeable ear cushions
actually give you an option depending
what kind of a sound you prefer you can
either use the okay oh these are secured
on here you can either use the plethora
ear cups that ship on the headset or you
can actually switch to these cloth gear
cups and the cloth ones are going to
provide a more open sounding experience
even though they are closed headphones
as opposed to the pleather ones so you
kind of get a little bit of
customization and they do include both
options in the package so I'm gonna go
ahead and pull the headset off of the
package because it is their most
expensive and most premium product to
date for a headset it does look like it
okay so you've got here
what compare against their previous
high-end there are some similarities but
also some
significant differences so first of all
you notice that the band for the
headrest up at the top is quite a bit
wider versus the old finding to be - you
see that it's quite a bit wider so
you're gonna get a more spread out
comfortable feel up on the top of the
headset itself I can tell right away
that these are quite closed I can barely
hear myself talking right now with these
on which is great for not disturbing
others late at night when you're gaming
or listening to music or whatever else
you happen to be doing with your
headphones and I put these on the wrong
way this is the way they go sorry about
that
so we'll have a quick look at what we've
got included in terms of accessories
first and then we'll have a closer look
at the headset itself so here's another
key difference that I noticed right off
the bat
long pause is that the second H actually
has a mini USB cable here whereas the
5hv - has a permanently attached cord so
that makes it a little bit easier to
transport because they both come apart
into three pieces
but now the 7h can actually come apart
in three pieces and keep the cable
separate whereas the five hvcu came
apart in two pieces but had the cable
permanently attached to the one ear cup
okay so the actual accessories included
here we go we have the short version of
the cable so here's your headphone and
microphone jacks as well as your mini
USB right here so this goes into the
bottom of this ear cup just like that
okay it doesn't well it has a bit of a
clip on it but you can pull it out with
a firm tug so that's no problem
and the reason SteelSeries has these
short cables is because if you have a
supported keyboard with an audio
pass-through you can actually plug them
right into the keyboard have a nice
short cable and keep it right on your
head when you're gaming so it keeps the
cord from really getting in the way and
then they also include an extended audio
cable so the extended audio cables if
you do have to go around to the back of
your computer
that's a nice long cable
you'll be able to go pretty much
wherever you need to go with it these
are gold plated connectors on both ends
so you don't have to worry about that
and they aren't quite clearly labeled if
you want to come have a look close up
here so you can see that this is the
microphone it is also color-coded here
but on there there's a little headphone
icon and then on this one it just
clearly says mic right on the connector
the last piece included and this is
optional so this only comes with the USB
version is a USB sound card so you plug
this into a USB port and then without
any interaction from the sound card you
can just have audio running off of USB I
mean it's not the best thing in the
world but if you want all of your
settings configurable then and you can
just move the thing from one computer to
another it'll actually keep that
consistency if you're if you're that
much of a pro another thing that
SteelSeries does provide with their
software for the sound card is Virtual
Surround
so they say you've got Virtual Surround
7.1 you can actually configure how many
speakers and exactly where you want them
position so that's another thing that's
pretty cool about the USB sound card and
it's not an expensive adder I think it
only costs another 20 bucks or so so I
think that pretty much covers everything
I wanted to say I'm gonna go ahead and
put the headset back together really
quickly here hopefully to demonstrate
just how easy it is there we go that was
easy
oh you know what we should also show you
know let's just show the headset a
little bit closer up so you got your
SteelSeries logo up along the top here
on either side you've got these kind of
metal looking steel series logos the ear
cups actually rotate like this which I
don't believe was a feature of the 518 -
no it was not so that's going to give
you a more comfortable listening
experience whether your heads are
whether your ears are positioned like
closer to the back ear head or closer to
the front the angle will adjust itself
such that you can be very very
comfortable also I didn't talk about the
retractable mic this is a steel series
staple it's existed on their high-end
headsets for quite a while now but
they've refined the look of a microphone
a little bit it looks a more
professional and less kind of like a big
teardrop
so that's one
their thing that's cool and let me see
what else I have to say about it I think
that pretty much covers it I'm going to
be doing probably either a separate
video or or I'll do some annotations on
top of this video once I have a chance
to listen to it I'll be comparing it
against these sennheiser HD 5 v 5s as
well as the sennheiser pc 350s so thank
you for checking out my video on the
SteelSeries 7h USB don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips ok I missed
2 small things sorry about that first of
all there is an inline volume control
and mic shut off key so if I could just
get the camera to have a close look here
you can see it's labeled mic for the
button right here and then there is a
volume control slider right there very
convenient and last but not least I
never did take a close look at the
interchangeable ear cups so you have the
cloth ear cup option which is as simple
as just pulling off the plethora ones
that are included it should hopefully I
can figure out now that I'm on the spot
I've been shown this before it wasn't it
wasn't difficult when I saw it so there
we go just get your fingernail under
there pop that up there we go and
there's a little instruction here a line
top with the dot on the cushion so you
can see the one I pulled off has a
little orange dot on it the one that I'm
putting on has a little orange dot on it
and it says simple as that I guess let's
go ahead and put that on ok you just
snap that right on so once I have that
in place I can actually hear quite a lot
more through my left ear then I can
through my right ear and the point of
that like I mentioned before is to give
it a more open feeling listening
experience versus an entirely closed
experience because this makes a much
better seal with your head then a cloth
inner cup does</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
