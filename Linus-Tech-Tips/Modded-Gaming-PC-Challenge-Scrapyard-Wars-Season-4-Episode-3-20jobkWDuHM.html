how this works at this point it is time
again for scrapyard wars but we're
throwing a wrench into the rules once
more we're gonna have a bigger budget
$900 per team and because that gives us
enough money to build something that not
only performs well but also looks good
we've brought in BS mods professional
computer modders extraordinaire to lend
both me and Luca hand so I'll welcome to
our guests Bob and rod and without
further ado let's get started
so we're ready to call him back um we're
a little late actually yeah it's 2:25
can I have your phone oh wait no you
call them with Brandon's phone okay
Brandon can I have you're not gonna like
this Turks what
hey got a reply from the other guy he
says he's willing to pay the full 400 so
I'm gonna have to take his offer sorry
whoa hold on
no we just won the lottery I do however
have an XFX reference cooler cooled card
I can sell you for 260 okay you why
didn't he tell us that in the first
place then when we were like begging for
a better deal
done deal that fits better in our budget
- you're a fast texter name the time and
place that is also I wonder if his
brother has that though kissy I don't
remember the thing was as though his
brother was dealing with it and whatever
oh I hope so we want to get in it today
um cuz that card performs almost
identical and so that so we just got
extra money in our pocket yeah if that's
I'm getting a CPU cooler or you can have
more modding crap whatever no I mean
we're pretty good other than that is
great
okay well let's let's enjoy our food
knowing that we may have just pulled
this out of the fire I feel really good
about our computer hardware um a year
ago when we did the first scrap yard
Wars I might not have felt as good about
what we got for our money but quite
frankly with how competitive the used
market seems to have gotten I mean we
ended up buying from someone whose
entire job it is to scavenge used stuff
assemble it into systems and sell it and
that combined with the way the Canadian
dollar has tanked
I feel really good about what we got
considering the market conditions I
think Luke and rod are going to have a
hard time matching the raw spec of our
system okay so what are you planning for
the lighting then
well we don't all we have right now is
just that one case fan that's a blue LED
and that's not really going to be enough
yeah but we okay well now we can
probably afford a water cooler
you found the cooler 924 what was it
uh what was it like 50 bucks 50 bucks or
best offer so we might get it for less I
think that one comes with two fans so
right now we've got a 120 and 140 with
this yep so honestly the blue LED fan is
kind of the odd man out but one of the
categories is lighting so we can't
abandon it so I have LED strip lighting
in my tool box
okay and it would definitely light up
the whole case like it's like a whole
kit so it would do the whole case really
bright we really needed to spend at
least another couple hours on aesthetics
today we burned over three hours just
driving it really hurt what I think
we're gonna be able to deliver in the
aesthetic Department hopefully Bob can
prove me wrong tomorrow but right now
I'm pretty worried so look kind of like
that and for a close-up it looks like
big so if we got like a rusted can't so
if we chopped it like here so that we
just have the stick and none of this
crap and then like strapped of
rusticated having some thunder sticks
they do stick tall often off the
machines - these are going tall the
chassis might not leave that either but
yeah I think if we totally we ought to
ditch the top this is also a cure so if
we cut if we cut here where there's a
nice hopefully I don't know work with
them boo a nice inside we can use a
screw like put a plug piece in of
something and then we can cover the this
looks like bamboo parts with some
strapping or tape yeah
yeah yeah all right I'm gonna start
trying to get through that okay I just
heard back from the guys brother
he says it's okay to meet at 6:30 nice
perfect 6:30 yeah
oh that's even better yeah that's half
an hour better yeah he says he can come
home earlier and he can meet up earlier
but I don't even know if we're gonna be
done here right I'm tell ya what time is
right now it's 3:15 I'm gonna ask where
he's located okay
so I'll find that out either way we're
in good shape we're gonna have a video
card which is not having a video come
and then wait on the cooler or so we
should get an answer back so hopefully
wrecked me show me what could do while
uses are more important things I was
actually trying to figure out what I
could get Linus to start doing that
would not get either one of us hurt so
we're all stripped down so one last
thing I think we want to do is pull out
pull out the hard drive cage right here
okay because we can just open up this
space it's not really needed since we
only have one SSD we can just use like
double back tape or something stick it
somewhere yeah yeah that's perfect
so so this can be gone okay
the optical Bay we got to leave because
it's part of the instruction the
structural integrity of the case itself
for keeping it from bending so I just
got to drill out somewhere oh yeah it
looks like okay if you go to the bottom
here we got those you got these two here
and then those two there you want to do
that and have me cut out the window you
better cut them though I would do such a
crappy job of the one you want me to do
at the same time here yeah yeah yeah go
go ham yeah we're gonna we're gonna make
the best use of the labor that we have
right now because we have used a lot of
time on hardware
how freaking badass is the hatch
you can get Alexis food
you can grab with your initials will go
like
we started actually working on the
aesthetic stuff I did worry a little bit
about overall time but rod is really
fast and if he gives me something that I
can actually work on I can hopefully be
pretty fast so I think we're gonna be
able to pull it together the fit yup I
think we should win purely on the fact
that you know their computers not going
to be as explosive as ours our computer
is definitely going to be dangerous
whether it's our computer could
literally kill their computer right and
our own right it probably will and then
the building yeah so much for the - tech
tips yeah so they should probably let us
win it was a good run we're like the
wookie anyone get that reference yep all
right there we go how did you turn it on
what I don't know how to turn it on this
little this whole thing but you have to
push this little tab
no you're the pitch changes a movie
really then I have to use it like this
it sounds ridiculous for not to place
throw sparks at you yeah like thanks
hahaha I don't even care enough so I
would probably be like this scent yeah I
think that's the thing all right
I didn't breathe that whole time huh I'm
sure this sounds super dope through the
mic sure that just sounds great
we've figured actually out a fair amount
of things I'm pretty happy with today's
progress we still have some stuff we
need to acquire which is becoming a
problem over time but the aesthetic
stuff I think is really coming along I
think we have just about every element
of design in our case on in progress
yeah so yeah finish the 6:00 tomorrow
and drop some hardware in I'm a little
worried about the cables on that power
supply like I was thinking about you
know what we can do with this acrylic on
the way over here and they're just gonna
keep ugly there's there's there's things
we can do so we can cover them are you
saying you weren't sure if we had enough
of colic for the back panel but I think
we do I think we got lots we can get the
power supply and we can actually snip
back any wires we don't need that's true
we can snip those off get those out way
so that eliminates that then anything
that's left if there's any way we could
put something over them I don't care if
we use a sock or something just to put
like anything whatever and you know you
can try to paint the wires themselves
but as soon as you spray them with spray
paint then you're gonna have a chemical
reaction and they're just gonna get
gooey so the insulation on the wiring is
gonna turn gooey on you now if you
didn't touch it it might look okay from
afar so for happy it's something we
probably don't want to do but okay I'm
gonna start by tearing down the power
supply net okay yeah and then we can we
can snip anything back yeah I'll have
this done about five minutes oh okay all
right sorry who'd you hear back from
okay so this is a CPU cooler guy yeah so
uh he says yes it works
for and as well as oh I can't oh yes it
works for ya okay so I live close to
Joyce station okay that's actually
pretty close to where we need to go for
the video card anyway okay so if it's
for just about 4:30 right now so should
I tell them a time and say can we meet
up at like whatever time let me let me
get a closer let me get a closer ETA for
you but yeah we should be able to make
it part of the same trip I think - let's
do blue and silver I will do a design
actually dude since we're gonna do like
race and stretch around here like let's
put a racing stripe on that power supply
stripe done that'll be killer racing
stripe - where is that overdoing no you
know what that's bingo that's exactly
what we need to do so if we carry the
theme so if we go racing stripe on the
outside
racing stripe on the power supply racing
stripe on the SSD it ties it all
together super easy this kid wants what
50 bucks for that thing or whatever so
and I'm sure we could probably get it
for 40 okay so just let me do the
talking
a lot of laughing going on we'll see how
much you guys are giggling when you lose
yeah no hole fuck that we need that okay
I mean is it really a surprise when I'm
victorious though do you mean with or
without cheating like you know is it
you've been following you this whole
time did I seem like the kind of person
who would cheat Wow so there's gonna be
our winner
nice let the people color
just leave the plastic on oh it's five
o'clock is it really holy crap okay
time flies man - speaking oh okay you
know what I've actually tracked down
most of what I need I think but do you
have any CPU coolers see see how he
comes straight over here instead of
going over to the other team
I don't know it wasn't any hurry trying
to get me to come over there it was kind
of just like well sure I mean what's so
cool about it it's cool and awesome now
get up here
actually what am I looking at trust me
it'll be awesome
we can't tell you that okay it looks
good you're gonna pick this up yeah
that's great huh yeah yeah we're going
for a rustic I've got a wood case before
I actually did a case out of old crappy
pallet wood okay look at that dude
that's gonna be so awesome
once that's painted I am okay I hope
that paint will work over plastic on its
own so we have to or cut around or
something but yep all right rock on can
you wet sand with alcohol no just want
to use water that will be awesome
ouch
shoot we have to go it's 5:45 crap we're
gonna leave this sitting just like this
yeah we got I mean we definitely got to
get this stuff
so our UTA is saying we're gonna be
about 11 minutes late for our rendezvous
with the video card guy but there's
another wrench in the plan we are out of
gas so I'm gonna have to stop somewhere
on the way we're gonna have to message
them and let them know that we're
running about 15 minutes late which
should still be okay but we're gonna
have to let bus then we're gonna have to
let the CPU cooler guy I know yeah I was
just gonna scrapyard wars we'll return
after this message from our sponsor this
episode of scrapyard Wars is brought to
you by D brand makers of the precision
cut vinyl skins that you see on the
phones and laptops of the contestants
they may not be bulletproof but they
look really cool try out their
configurator at D brand comm linked in
the video description
do we have enough time to finish this
mod Bob um once it's gotta be done
and today tomorrow 5:30 tomorrow yep oh
crap
okay we've got a 3d 3d program running
all right let's uh let's do this bang
and mosey we've got our video card
we still have 23 minutes before we have
to wrap up for the day and all that's
left is to meet up with the guy who has
our CPU cooler we're getting an N Tech
cooler 920 that's an all-in-one liquid
cooler and we have all of our hardware
ready to go at that point so we got to
head back to the office and tomorrow we
have the whole day to build which Bob
insists is going to be enough and we are
going to finish but I do not share his
confidence okay so what we say 40 yep so
did he ever confirm that no but that's
what he's getting this 40 bucks okay so
if you're gonna be that guy then you're
gonna be that guy tell you what I'll
give you the I'll give you that I'll
give you the 10 to have in your back
pocket no it's not necessary so you're
getting it for 40 Oh
all right on hey I'm Bob hey nice to
meet you - hi oh hey did you get our
message yeah so it's 40 bucks gonna work
for you oh sure cool awesome all right
Oh Oh actually huh
okay cool yeah - oh it's okay I'm yeah
I'm familiar with buying hardware on the
street corner you know yes everything's
here everything's good to go let's pay
the man and we are we are for four
minutes to the deadline thank you okay
thank you
okay let's take our let's take our
water-cooler our ace in the hole water
cooler that we're gonna overclock our
2500 today with and yeah that's the last
piece of the puzzle yes piece of the
puzzle we have everything we need
mission accomplished
yes friends mission accomplished all the
hardware I think well were one minute
from pencils down time today and we are
done we are done actually on ncx I found
some SSDs that were just as cheap as
they are on Craigslist so people need to
figure out and start selling used things
at discounts then not yet try to sell
them at full price I'm cutting out our
front panel to fit our suite gauges so
we want this to drop flush so it's not
interfering with like our torch there's
a guy with a 240 gigabyte v 300 480
bucks which is still available we've got
an 840 Evo which is still available
which is 90 bucks and it's a 250 gig and
then the power supply we've got for $45
the energy hazard inside sticker which
actually might have been a good idea to
keep on because you know fire is like
type of energy thermal energy movie
should left it but I think for the
aesthetic it's better with it warnings
that's kind of true fire is all the one
you need these were the ones that were
only $4.99 yeah but if you had two more
of these caps you can drill the caps and
get a case foot I'm getting everything
cleaned on the case for paint over here
right you can't have any dust oils
finger France Greece sticker GU the
thing is if there's still a little grimy
it's probably okay but I don't want them
to be like disgusting
well Linus might be fine
claiming that he needs to build a
computer for a immigrant girls orphanage
for the challenged and elderly I kind of
feel bad when I handle people because
like I don't need to save $5 on a power
supply but for the contest I do but like
especially like if I was like 15 and
trying to sell my powers why so I could
buy a new computer component like five
five bucks is actually pretty impactful
so like it's pretty easy to haggle with
people and then like I kind of feel like
I should hide my car when I Drive up
he's like oh yeah I Drive like a
relatively new car and I really need
that five bucks off that power supply
that's so much with like one bolt so
maybe we have to put I got enough room I
could put a wood block and screw it in
here this way too then come all the way
through it long screws
okay so we want to allow our piston rods
to go together but they've got an extra
lip right here where they connect the
crankshaft so I'm going to come in and
take this extra inch of probably pretty
hard casting off it there you go hot
metal let's shoot this really quick just
some nice light
yeah so we got some stone accent paint
it's black with a little bit of a kind
of a brown in it we've kind of done an
overall brown texture coat kind of do
emulate rust and harsh conditions so I
want to throw some accents on to it with
the darker color so I'm just gonna throw
some streaks right across it and so now
it looks like it's really been around
for a few years which it has it's pretty
old chassis planned today is to get the
system hopefully get a power supply and
SSD and do everything we possibly can in
terms of aesthetics I'm not sure we're
going to get to 100% in terms of
aesthetics but we'll get as much as we
can so we're picking up a power supply
at 3:30 it's currently 110 I'm trying to
get on the laptop so I can figure out
when we're picking up the SSD and the
system the guy said and I quote later I
am at work around noon I will text you
when I'm there and ready I have to take
care of some shipping this morning first
so it's 110 now he hasn't messaged me
yet a little bit worried about that I've
tracked down two more tiki torches
well technically 61 more tiki torches
but we only need two and we can use the
caps on there as feet for the case so
we might end up going to get those but
getting a little bit worried about the
component stuff I've got an email from
one of the guys
apparently the SSD guy can meet us
around 2:00 or 3:00 so that's good
actually I'll try to miss the gym so I'm
trying to schedule things out so we can
most optimize our time in the workshop
the system guy wants us to pick it up
relatively soon he doesn't really have a
time power supply guy wants us to pick
it up at 3:30 and the SSD guy wants to
either deliver or have us pick it up or
I'm still trying to figure that out from
2 o'clock to 3 o'clock so I'm hoping to
line it up so that we either get the SSD
or receive esse or go get the SSD like
2:30 ish and then go get the system for
three o'clock ish and then get the power
supply for 3:30 ish and be back here by
hopefully four and then keep working we
still have an hour of flux tension last
night possibly an hour and a half
considering they went half an hour over
but we'll have to grill them about that
later ok so here we are day three we've
got to be finished our build at the end
of the day and I think Bob went out to
dinner with the enemy last night and got
potentially some useful Intel they
didn't like come out and say anything
obviously because they didn't want me to
know what was going on but they were
trying to do the whole code speak thing
you know and but they had to show each
other some texting and whatever so what
I gather from that is that they don't
have all their hardware yet so they
actually had somebody deliver something
here to the shop for them last night
they are still in need of something and
it what I could get from the code speak
is that they were not sure that their
deal was going to go through we're not
even and so they were gonna have to
scramble to find something else
meanwhile we've got the heat cranked in
the warehouse to uh speed up our paint
drying times
and we are pretty much ready to get
rocking here okay um so one thing I do
want to do is get that hardware fired up
at some point here maybe actually see it
won't take you too long to bench stuff
right then it'll take me a while yeah if
you want to do that I'll go ahead and
just handle all this stuff okay and then
we'll regroup so I was pretty nervous
about us not being in paint yet last
night but we're hitting the paint booth
first and I still hear metal fabrication
sounds over there so we've got all our
hardware and we've got our fabrication
done we're in pain I'm feeling pretty
good about where we're sitting right now
so basically this is like I just I need
something to set stuff on when I paint
it so this is just a quick and dirty
little stand out of some cardboard we
have a Samsung SSD right which means we
can install Samsung's SSD magician
software to utilize RAM as a cache now
unfortunate thing is we don't have a lot
of RAM in our system but we still have
$60 so if I can find a deal on another 8
gigs of RAM I might want to get it today
maybe 20 yesterday so DOM is over yeah I
still owe you 20 that's right yeah ok
ok so I have 40 bucks I have 43 dollars
people are asking about 50 for 8 gigs of
ddr3 so I would have to spend
effectively everything you'd be left
with 2 dollars and 75 cents again for
the rest of your mod do you need
anything else the only thing I'm
concerned about is paint should we need
one more can of paint
so if I could offer ok here's another
thing I got a guy who's made an offer on
the enttec case oh yeah yeah yeah um
should I take the offer on the enttec
case even though that's kind of gray
which gives us another 15 bucks or 10 10
bucks 10 bucks 6 well I mean that's
another can of paint if we need it I
don't know that it's worth the risk of
the paint and then the time we're gonna
lose tracking the hardware down because
we actually do have quite a bit to do
and we got
allow for drying times just because I
can get it painted yeah okay now we're
gonna we don't know how long it's gonna
take
yeah and then that pulls me away okay
I'll you know what if he's down the road
and he'll take thirty five bucks or
something and I can get the Antec case
done and I'm gonna do Watts how much 50
he wants 50 I don't think he's gonna
take 35 but we'll see I got a lead on
our case I told the guy I got someone
coming tonight so if he doesn't come get
it today you can't have it and then I've
got a couple people asking 50 bucks for
eight gigs of RAM one of which actually
has identical RAM here's a listing for
40 maybe I can offer this guy
maybe I can offer this guy 30 oh this
one's close wait is it oh this one's
close this one's like a 10-minute Drive
okay
now that that came loose eventually you
there's some there's some stuff in here
you can see there's like yellow gunk
let's get the shoddy tubing off here
replaced by some real TV fantastic
come on I was right about the water
having evaporated from this thing it's
completely full of gunk what are we
gonna do no wonder when I tried to dump
out the rat it wasn't going
it's totally clogged up now what I hope
is that it's just here in the barbs or
something let's go see it's my fault I
guess no one can really get mad at me
right
and there we go and we're getting water
out now that we've I'm clogged it is
friggin pebbles my radiator the side is
still not clear
sure Bob won't mind me using his allen
key set to do this
good thing I was planning to take this
apart cuz if I had found out during
final assembly that her water cooler
didn't work and it was completely
clogged like no amount of turning it off
and turning it back on again was gonna
fix that Bob you ready we gotta leave
one minute ago okay you ready let's do
it alright let's go grab my food find my
phone we're doing Linus's OCD things now
where Linus really feels like a modern
system with a 2500 K and an R 9 to 9 you
should really have 16 gigs of ram not 8
gigs of ram we're spending pretty much
the rest of our budget on another 8 gigs
of ram where we out on painting we are
doing actually pretty good really so
that let's see I have a few small
miscellaneous things completely done I
have all the fabrication is a hundred
percent done they're still fabricating I
just have to sand all the parts and just
start blasting them with paint we're
literally like flying through this
section of the paint stuff
yeah you are good please count on I feel
more comfortable if other people found
my sanity all right all right
pleasure doing business with you thank
you very much sure we got a competition
to win so so Bob final count after I
paid back the 20 bucks I borrowed from
you yesterday is five dollars and 70
cents I gotta say I feel like pretty
damn confident about the modding part
really in because I think with smoothing
out the insides and everything and just
go with a good silver color and then
whatever we do for some access and I
feel pretty good it's hard to beat that
I think we're going to have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
