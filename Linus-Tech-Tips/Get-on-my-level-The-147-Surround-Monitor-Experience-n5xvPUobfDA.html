possibly the final installment of what
I'm calling James tries stuff for the
first time today I'm gonna use whatever
tools I can find just laying around to
make the most pointless PC gaming setup
possible Hey look what are these doing
here 349 inch 32 by 9 gaming monitors
each one of these is designed to be an
elegant standalone solution for
achieving both of productivity and
gaming benefits usually reserved for
double or even triple monitor setups but
hey I'm super naive why not connect all
three of them to create a 180 degrees
semicircle of pixel paradise builds da
GG is at it again with the stock cooling
showdown up to four thousand dollars and
hardware prizes are up for grabs for the
most highly voted systems and for people
who simply vote click the link below to
join
welcome back step one is to get a
computer particularly one that has
enough video out ports to connect one to
one to each of your three monitors now
it is possible to go thrum one
DisplayPort two like a hub where you
split off to other DisplayPort cables
that might be possible depending on the
resolutions of your monitors but it's
always better to have a dedicated cable
especially considering that DisplayPort
is pretty janky at the best of times I'm
also using the highest quality cables
that I could find because the
DisplayPort spec actually is only built
around a cable length of three meters
which is about precisely 9.8 feet so if
you're gonna go beyond that which you
may well do considering that if you're
using monitors this wide end to end
they're like 10 feet if you need to go
beyond 9.8 feet with a display port
cable the longer the cable the higher
quality they should be for our computer
we're going to be using a Corsair one
Pro because it has an RT X xx atti
inside which I know is capable of
pushing all the pixels I need to these
giant displays so that's just one less
thing to screw me over the next thing
you need is a bunch of monitors now
ideally you would be using three
identical monitors at least with the
same resolution and the same aspect
ratio but it does help if they're
actually the same maked model because
then they're gonna have the same sync
polarity and more uniform colors across
all of it we don't have that here today
what we have although these are each of
them 32 by 949 inch monitors there are
three different brands we've got an LG
Adel and a Samsung behind me the Samsung
has a resolution of 3840 by 1080 and a
refresh rate of 144 Hertz while the
other two although they do share the
same LG made panel which is a bonus they
have a resolution of 50 120 by 1440 and
a refresh rate of 60 Hertz so we we're
just gonna have to find out if this
mishmash screws us in the end
the first thing I'm noticing here is
that this is kind of stupid
these are already so wide that I don't
know if it would be practical for
basically anybody's workflow to have
them arranged to like this the other
thing I'm thinking about here is the
keyboard in the mouse okay if I'm over
here it's a little awkward especially if
these were turned in more and I was more
surrounded you'd be a little weird to be
typing over here and crank up my neck
this way I got an idea okay so I found
some scraps extruded aluminum that we
had from a 16 k gaming and I've never
used this stuff before but Alex said
it's pretty easy to work with yeah okay
now for the piece de resistance that's
more like it
now that our setup is completely
ridiculous let's try actually gaming
follow me okay so you'll see we're only
using one third of our potential girth
here so that's no good go into the
settings the resolution 51 20 by 1440 is
the resolution of one of these if I go
into windowed mode nope no option to do
that okay I think it's time we opened
the Nvidia control panel okay so the
point of surround is to make your
computer think that you have just one
monitor with one resolution okay let's
play it safe and start with just two of
our monitors one by two will pick the LG
and the Dell so ten thousand two hundred
and forty pixels that's the width of
those two screens it's created one
combined resolution because it's gonna
treat it like it's one monitor very cool
so let's see if we can get it to do that
with all three monitors we're going to
change our topology to one by three
select every monitor including the
Samsung okay so I was expecting what
like 12,000 this is 57 60 by 1080
if I go to calculator and divide that by
three monitors 1920 it's treating this
like each one of these is 1920 by 1080 I
think it's because you're not allowed to
mix and match resolutions so I mean we
can try this Wow
stretch city okay this is kind of cool
and immersive it's not working properly
but I don't think it's because of the
1920 surround error thing I think it's
because this game is just not meant to
do this see how it gets really stretched
out on the sides like that car and the
car looks really close and when I go
like this it looks a lot farther away
and that's because this game is
rendering with only one camera position
games that are meant to be played like
this they're gonna render from multiple
camera positions and then the result is
gonna be that teammates don't look like
that oh boy
good god good gravy okay okay okay let's
get out of here what if I forced all
these to be the same resolution so one
way I could do that which would suck
would be to just run my higher as ones
at a lower rest so I'd run them all at
38 40 by 1080 that's not that cool
because why did I buy or have sent to
this company higher res monitors so
instead we're gonna try to do super
sample the low res one to render as
though it is 50 120 by 1440 there are
some drawbacks even if you can gets
around to work like let's say I had
monitors that were all the same and
surround work for me and it was awesome
there's still some drawbacks because it
makes it seem like it's all one monitor
which is not ideal when you're not
gaming if I'm just using my desktop and
it's treated like one monitor then when
I go to maximize one of my windows for
example you're gonna have like a Windows
Explorer window that's just like
eight feet of white and it's not easy to
just place a window on only one monitor
for example and like your clock is gonna
be way over there while your Windows
Start menu is way over there for that
reason a lot of people who game with
surround on will actually turn it off
when they're not gaming and then turn it
back on when they go to game again which
sucks because it actually takes anywhere
between one and five minutes to get it
all configured every time now a lot of
these problems can be mitigated or
outright solved by using software like
Ultraman or Display fusion which is way
better because then you can just stay in
surround mode all the time and not have
to go back and do the display settings
like I have to right now and move stuff
around okay let's see if this works I go
into my Windows display settings I now
have a new resolution for my crappy
monitor my crappy thousand-dollar
awesome monitor so now we're gonna go
back into surround and see if we can get
the coveted 15,000 360 horizontal pixel
resolution that we were looking for no
there's just no there's no making it
work you can't even trick it but who
cares cuz we still might be able to get
the result we want sure it's not gonna
be exclusive full screen in our games
we'll take a slight performance hit but
we can still have lots of fun so let's
try some of the games that are designed
to be used in setup like this I'm gonna
look at a list of games that are
actually known to work with widescreen
Far Cry 5 we have that one this intro
sequence is a far cry from being
enjoyable options video aspect ratio
custom window mode windowed all the way
all the way oh whoa no ok now I think
I'm gonna try just running the benchmark
because I don't wanna get caught in the
20 minutes of cutscenes this game starts
with nice nice those hay bales aren't
really even stretched yeah they're
closer but it's not super distorted
things look proportional this is pretty
dank I don't have to look over there but
having it there is more immersive
all right enough Far Cry now I want to
try a racing game naturally I heard that
project cars 2 is pretty good for this
kind of thing so options holy cow look
at this I don't even have to go into
video there's a button specifically
saying triple screen configure your
settings to match your triple screen
setup hell yeah
triple screen spanning check these are
probably wrong but I'm gonna say that's
fine okay and again you can see on the
text of Toyota it's not stretched out
right okay this is pretty sweet oh look
one hand well then that rearview mirror
is like the same size as my actual
rearview mirror in my car this is like
almost life-size it's pretty cool and
just like real life I go the wrong way
okay this was a pretty stupid setup but
I still learned a few things number one
if you're into widescreen surround
gaming then make sure that the games you
want to play actually support it because
it really comes down to the games more
than anything if you're into racing
games and flight Sims then you're
probably good to go and I think more and
more regular mainstream shooter type
games are supporting it because 21 by 9
monitors are more mainstream but this
aspect ratio is still kind of rare and
then getting three of them is dumb
number two make sure all of your
monitors are the same resolution and
aspect ratio because that caused
headaches like we just have fewer
options because if we have the setup
that we do and number three is this
worth it
this particular setup that these
monitors is this the good way to go I
don't think so because first of all it's
super expensive yes it's more immersive
but for the cost like this is 4500
dollars worth of monitors is it really
that much more immersive than just
having I don't know one of them they
don't really have a very tight curve
that's an 1800 our curved one if you had
three monitors this aspect ratio that
had 1800 our curve
then it would be a tighter circle around
you but hey if it's all about
dick-measuring then this gives you a
huge dick
so speaking of things that are awesome
