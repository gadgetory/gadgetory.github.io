YouTube streaming on their own Android
platform it's so unbelievably playing
sorry my hand is shaking with rage so
unbelievably broken that I actually
haven't managed to do it that's why I
haven't been streaming that is straight
up why I haven't been streaming because
every time I try to stream it just
crashes and there's no oh resumed stream
or or pick up where you left off or
anything like that it just it just it
just crashes and it's gone and then it
throws the video up on the channel like
sort of except you can't find it in your
creator studio anyway anyway the point
is let me start over because this is
really important which is why I'm trying
to do it live I think that we can all
agree that the only kind of relationship
that's you know more sacred than family
you know like like the relationship
between a mother and a father and their
child or you know a husband and a wife
you know a brother and a sister the only
relationship more sacred than that is
the relationship between a youtuber and
his VPN sponsor and so this felt like
you know normally when we when we start
working with the new sponsor or we stop
working with a given sponsor we don't
you know we don't make a big deal out of
it but the way that this whole thing
went down was such that I really felt
like we had to sort of address our
community about it tunnel bear speaking
of addressing our community tunnel bear
haha yeah we all know the joke so tunnel
bear got acquired by McAfee and I've
I've got a lot I've got a lot of people
calling April Fool's on this this is not
April Fool's Colton
this is real this is real Brannon is
this real very real see even if you guys
don't trust me I've got I've got
independent third parties that I third
parties that I pay fake news you get you
get your fake get your your fake news
that you're still you're still you're
still on the frame you can't run out of
the frame and then still be in the frame
so no this is not April Fool's but I
wanted to kind of talk about why we're
doing this okay so I actually haven't
used McAfee McAfee Nick Nick Nick ass
whatever I don't know I think it's
McAfee anyway I haven't actually used
their software in a very long time like
most of you who are watching this anyway
it's pretty much the first thing that I
remove from a brand new system if it
happens to come pre-loaded with it
I've been perfectly happy with whatever
Microsoft's calling Windows Defender now
that's security essentials I think but
whatever it is I've been perfectly happy
with what's built into Windows and not
just not doing anything sketchy on the
internet and so I'm not gonna say that
they're bad because I like actually
don't know but what I will say is that
when the news dropped and and we
actually hardly even acknowledged it
when it happened we sent out one tweet
we were like oh um so yeah this happened
but when the news dropped that tunnel
bear was getting acquired by McAfee it
sparked some serious internal debate
here where we were kind of going holy
crap because lots tons of members of our
community reached out to us and go it
went like woah hey guys are you still
going to be promoting tunnel bear now
that they're owned by McAfee now there
are only a handful of things that we
know about the acquisition because we
actually haven't really heard much from
tunnel bear about it we know that they
said they're going to continue to
operate as an independent company but
what we also know is that because tunnel
bear is
going to have an American parent company
now they are going to be subject
potentially to two sets of internet laws
both Canadian and US which could mean
we're basically saying we don't know
what we do know is that it could have
implications for their privacy policy in
the future for their data collection and
sharing policy in the future and it
muddies the waters a little bit pedal
bearer has actually been a fantastic
partner over the years and one of the
sponsors that you know we continued to
be very happy to endorse because anytime
we had to use it for something like if
we're on the road and we had to get
access to a geo restricted piece of
content or something like that it always
worked great it was fine and we didn't
get complaints from our viewers which is
another big thing that we look for but
this this particular change really made
us step back and take a look at some of
the other options that are out there and
what's cool is that because of our size
now because of the reach of Linus tech
tips this revaluation opened up a lot of
options for us I'll be totally honest
with you guys we basically had the pick
of the litter when it came to which VPN
we wanted to partner with because
everyone in the industry was aware of
the impact that working with tunnel bear
or tunnel bear working with US had had
on their business so what we eventually
settled on was their their branding
might not be as you know mainstream
mainstream e appealing and the name is
sort of it sounds more like like sort of
a marketing bullet point than like the
actual name of the service but PIAA or
private Internet access is who we've
ultimately decided to partner with and
this is this is based on our own
research this is based on
recommendations from our viewers and
yeah I guess oh man this is like
actually kind of
easy you know speaking of crazy Ted
private Internet access oh yeah I nail
it okay okay good cuz this is gonna be
hard you guys it's gonna be real tough
so I can tell you guys a little bit
about it we'll have a link to private
Internet access below the first and most
obvious improvement moving from if
you're if you're one of our viewers
who's looking for a VPN the first and
most obvious improvement is that it is
way less expensive like by a long shot
like I was actually kind of surprised
when I looked I was like oh wow this is
considering what a great reputation
these guys have it is astonishingly
affordable and then they've got a bunch
of other features as well Colton's like
spammed my Hangouts with all the
features so I'll tell you guys about
some of them IP cloaking hide your true
IP address and geographic location I
should sure as hell hope so
it's a VPN if it doesn't do that then
it's terrible allows you to browse
anonymously keeping your identity hidden
say Bing avoid data mining and targeted
advertising so yeah it keeps people from
creating a profile of you allows you to
block unwanted connections unblock
websites so sort of that's exactly what
I was talking about before like if we
were traveling in a let's say you know
the United States and we wanted to watch
some TV BBC something or other it would
allow you to access websites that are
otherwise geo locked or get around
restrictive firewalls and censorship one
of their features is a great save money
oh okay they don't mean it in the sense
that their service is very affordable
they mean it in the sense that many
websites will offer different pricing
depending on the location that they
detect especially travel websites that
is actually something that I never
thought of okay
well that's pretty cool um yeah so
they've got apps for Windows Mac OS
Android iOS
this says Linus did you copy paste this
from somewhere because I'm sure they met
Linux
Linux and Chrome with support for
several other platforms coming soon
what the hell other platforms are there
okay well apparently other platforms
coming soon you can connect up to five
devices at the same time they have over
3000 bare metal servers and 44 locations
across 26 countries I can personally
vouch for the speed that I've had with
PIAA I've seen upwards of 20 to 30
megabytes per second on a P ia
connection with certain loads so that's
pretty cool
oh if you're one of those people out
there who's into torrenting PIAA unlike
tunnel bear this is another sort of key
difference that a lot of people had
complained to us about over the years
like one of the few complaints we got
about tunnel bear was that they don't
support torrenting PIAA does not to my
knowledge have any restrictions on what
you can do with it and their internet
kill switch blocks all traffic if the
VPN becomes disconnected unexpectedly so
that nothing leaks out so there you guys
have it that was the big breakup news
this is not a drill this is not April
Fool's Dennis's is a prank no what is
wrong with you people I hate you all
yeah I know that's awesome this is like
this is like hipster now you know so
yeah there you go guys that's that's the
big deal sort of sort of crazy so we
have a link to PIAA if you guys want to
switch that's of course an affiliate
link this video is brought to you by P
ia
I actually had wanted to do a more
formal announcement of this but it was
one of those things where we have a
video upcoming where we don't have like
a spot for it and so I wanted to do a p
IA spot for it but we had announced the
switch yet and i knew that people were
gonna have a lot of questions about why
we why we switch providers so hopefully
hopefully that will pretty much answer
them and yeah this this video is gonna
stay up this video is not gonna be
unlisted there's gonna be free public so
I guess I'll do an outro so thanks for
