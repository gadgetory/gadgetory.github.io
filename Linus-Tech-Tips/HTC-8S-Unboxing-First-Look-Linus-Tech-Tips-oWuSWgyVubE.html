packaging of these two phones this is
for the 8x this is the packaging for the
8's but the 8's is actually the little
brother of the 8x so it has a bit of the
lower spec overall a one gigahertz
processor versus the 1.4 gigahertz s4
processor in the 8x
it also has 512 Meg's of RAM four gigs
of on-board storage which probably seems
like not that much in the context of
installing like a ton of apps or
anything like that but this is more of
an entry-level phone overall so the
screen resolution is only 800 by 480
which is still a fairly respectable I
think 226 pixels per inch or something
along those lines it is smaller than the
8x so if you guys don't know already I'm
using an 8x as my daily driver phone I
switched from my iPhone 4 because I'm
doing a 30-day challenge where I'm
trying to see if I can survive in the
sort of fewer apps available and sort of
less well-established ecosystem that is
Windows Phone 8 as an avid iOS user so
I'm in the middle of that I don't
remember where I was going with this but
yes it is the younger brother of the 8x
it is smaller it has more of a rounded
shape to it that I actually find more
natural to to hold and I'd actually go
as far as to say I like the finish on
the back of it better than the 8x as
well because the 8x is a little bit
slippery on the back whereas the soft
touch feel on the 8's is is a bit more
grippy so the fact that I have small
hands makes it easier to hold from the
get-go and then the roundedness and the
and the grip enos means I should be able
to actually type more easily on an 8's
than an 8x one of the cool things about
Windows Phone is the fact that the way
they've optimized the UI it should be
snappy pretty much regardless of the
processing power available on the phone
but while that's what we're waiting for
that to turn on there's the screen it's
using Super LCD vs. Super LCD 2 in the 8
X version so while we're waiting for
that to turn on let's do a quick I phone
size comparison just because you know
it's what I do
so this is an iPhone 4 and then this is
the 8's up here you can tell because
they look very very very different so
the 8's has a slightly slightly larger
screen there you go
terms of the width it's fairly similar
but it is a little bit taller
at sixteen by nine and then you can tell
my iPhone 4 is pretty beat up overall
the rear camera is a 5 megapixel camera
it does have a built-in flash
unlike the 8x which has notification
LEDs on both sides so there's actually
one built in here and then one built in
under the grill on the front it looks
like the ADA doesn't get that feature
and it also doesn't get a front-facing
camera unfortunately now I don't want
this to turn into a whole huge list of
what the 8's doesn't have because it
does have a few things going for it it's
got a microSD expansion slot which you
can access by removing this bottom piece
right here somehow I actually haven't I
haven't had it out of the box yet so I
don't know how to access it but you the
sim installation is not down there yeah
it's down there as well as microSD
expansion but part of that is to
compensate for the fact that the AES has
four gigs of on-board storage so that
means for installing applications you're
going to have four gigs of space
including Windows Phone 8 alright so we
figured out a couple of things off
camera number one is that we all agree
that it has a really nice feel to it
just with the reduced weight the size
the the grip enos of the back and we
figured out there you go that's how to
remove the chin from the phone so it
actually comes off reasonably easily and
it looks like there's a built-in sensor
there that will allow the phone to know
that you've opened it up so that's good
there's your microSD expansion there's
your SIM card and then you can go ahead
and close it back up it because it
wasn't easy to remove I would say that
it was oh yeah there it goes see Mary I
would say that it's not easy to
accidentally remove because you have to
actually put pressure on it this
specific way we had to check the
instructions in order to figure that out
so this is the Windows Phone interface
we can click get started now most okay
the general consensus about this phone
seems to be that the UI is still very
snappy remember that's what that's what
Microsoft has done so here we're gonna
sign-in later
that's what Microsoft has done with
Windows Phone 8 is they've attempted to
say ok well regardless of whether it's a
1 gigahertz processor or 1.7 G a Hertz
processor or whatever else we still want
the UI to feel very smooth and
responsive now I've noticed this with
the 8x but obviously I haven't spent
to me time with the 8's yet so I won't
have I won't have any specific feedback
on that in terms of dedicated buttons
it's again in line with that Windows
experience so you've got a back button a
Windows key the back button also serves
as a multitasking button so you hold
that down to access your multitasking
applications so for example here on I'm
sorry I'm demoing on an 8x but that's
not what we're unboxing right now so you
just hold that down and you can skip
between all of your different all your
different applications that you have
open so that's what that buttons for the
Windows button goes back to sort of the
main home screen which is where you keep
all of your live tiles so there you can
see little previews and notifications
you can scroll down and access other
live tiles and then the search button so
this is a dedicated search button which
takes you to a Bing search now the Bing
search attempts to look at whatever
you're searching for when you press it
and go okay he's probably if he searches
for Hello Kitty he's probably looking
for pictures whereas if he searches for
guide on how to drywall something then
he's probably looking for a video or
whatever else so it tries to be
intelligent that way one of my
complaints about Windows Phone is I wish
it was more like a contextual search and
it searches for whatever you happen to
be looking at but that's not the way
it's designed they want it to be very
sort of searchable on the phone does
include seven gigs of storage on
SkyDrive so that and the expansion using
micro sd should help to alleviate some
of the some of the issues people might
have with having only four gigs of
storage for installing apps and for
entry-level users it may not be an issue
for me personally I would find four gigs
to be restrictive but if that's the case
you can't always step up to you know the
bigger brother the 8x in line with that
consistent Windows experience you've got
the buttons that are included so there's
your three-and-a-half millimeter Jack
here there's your power button here at
the top your volume buttons here on the
side and finally a dedicated two stage
camera button so this is for the five
megapixel camera that is a back mounted
camera and the way that it works if the
phone is the phone's booted up now right
nope still setting up your phone okay
again I'm gonna do this I'm gonna show
it to you on the 8x because this is the
one that I actually have booted up so
the way that works is you actually hold
it down to
your camera app and then you can focus
with a half click and then take your
picture with the second click so I
actually found it very very quick very
responsive to use on the 8x and we
clearly haven't tried it on this one yet
right last thing to mention is that
beats audios not I was going to say
sticker but that beats audio branding on
the back the 8x actually has one of the
better speakers that I've encountered on
a phone yet
including slicks s3 that we've got handy
here for size comparison as well here
I'll let you guys enjoy that size
comparison while I talk about the audio
so it has one of the better built-in
speakers but that's not actually what
the Beats Audio branding is about the
Beats Audio branding is all about the
headphone experience so you can actually
turn it on or turn it off and what it
does is it boosts up the audio level so
it does make the audio louder and it
also amps up the lows and the highs so I
personally didn't find it to make much
of a difference for me well I found it
to make a difference but I found turning
on Beats Audio didn't make my music more
enjoyable for me but I didn't find the
onboard audio for the 8x again I'm
talking about the 8x to be objectionable
either so you can turn Beats Audio off
and then it's a perfectly good audio
chipset in there so it wasn't an issue
that I had it turned off so the Beats
Audio branding is here so this one has
Beats Audio as well we can have a look
at what's included in terms of
accessories so you get a couple HTC
stickers that do that you get a Windows
Phone 8 s by HTC quick guide that shows
you some basic stuff like installing the
sim which we used customizing your start
so your Start menu customizing your
ringtone keeping in touch so the people
app is actually very useful it takes
sort of your Facebook your Linkedin your
Twitter and all that stuff and just kind
of yeah puts it all in one place and it
works very well it works better I'd say
for consuming information than it does
for posting information because I found
things like tweeting from the People app
somewhat limiting and a little bit
non-intuitive but it's great for just
kind of seeing what's up with the people
that you follow are the people that
you're connected to at
Glantz rooms and groups keeping things
in sync another thing that I absolutely
love about Windows Phone all the apps
finished installing all done there we go
so the 8's has fired up one of the other
things that I love about Windows Phone
is moving media on and off of the phone
is absolutely drag-and-drop you plug in
a micro USB cable and then it's just a
folder which is the way that every phone
should work for copying music I should
not have to deal with iTunes to get some
music on my stupid phone that's just
ridiculous so here we go that's what the
that's how the UI smoothness is on the
8's here so again I can't really see
anything that would particularly bother
me about it compared to the 8x now if
you're browsing the internet for example
you'd probably run into things that are
a little bit slower on the 8's versus
the 8x but the Windows Phone ecosystem
is designed for this I don't know if I
mentioned this before it has 512 Meg's
of RAM and right let's see if there's
anything else included right so you do
get a wall wart there we go as well as
the USB cable that I mentioned before
that you might need and I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
