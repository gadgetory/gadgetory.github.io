been meaning to do for a while this is
Anna soos zonar Zen sir since whatever
you prefer to call it I'm going to call
it since for the sake of pronouncing and
how I feel it should be pronounced here
you can see there's a little acoustic
powered by Sennheiser logo on the side
so that is because this is part of that
bundle that comes with the PC 350
special edition headset which uses the
larger Jack's for both the microphone as
well as the headphones here's your
standard 7.1 channel audio out our
brother 8 channel 7.1 I don't know why
they call it 7.1 channel and then
there's a spit if out that is capable of
both coaxial as well as optical audio
output so what I'm going to be doing
with this sound card today which I did
do a full tech tips episode on and when
I what I talked about a lot in the tech
tips episode was the importance of a
headphone amp for getting the most out
of your sound so this card has an
integrated amp and today what we're
going to be doing is we are going to be
changing oh yeah be integrated out
that's why it needs a molex power
connector even though it's a sound card
we're going to be changing the op amps
so seuss had a like a special little
program a little while back where they
were offering a free an upgrade for the
zone our essence sts TX and the Zins so
here I have my my op amps here these are
the replacement ones and I'm going to be
walking you guys through the procedure
of changing the op amps on your zone our
Zen's so first of all there are a few
screws that need to be removed here now
remember you can put in whichever op
amps you want the ones here are yeah I'm
just going to show you guys the part
number and let you figure that out for
yourself because the reality of it is I
am actually not that hard core of an
audio buff so I wouldn't know the
difference between these and other op
amps so hopefully you guys can see that
pretty well okay so I'm just going to be
showing you guys the
the hardware aspect of installing the
stock s seuss op-amp upgrade kit so I'm
doing the screws now I better zoom out
so you guys can see what I'm doing
better here
okay now I'm not sure if this is going
to come off yet there may be one more
screw let's just undo this one and see
what happens there we go
okay so we're going to pull off what is
a shroud / EMI blocker / heatsink I
don't know what it is but it looks like
it's also attached to the PCI bracket
here so that's one more screw there we
go
looks like this is the same kind of
screw so should be no problem to
remember which ones go where okay it is
not a heatsink so let the record show
that so right there those are the
included op amps and replacing them
should be quite straightforward here
this also gives us a look at the at the
insides of the zone our card that we're
using here so hmm this might actually be
kind of challenging because I'm having a
little bit of trouble getting my camera
to stay right now ah there we go okay so
what I may actually need since it's kind
of hard to get in there is uh hmm I
might need just a little screwdriver or
something so give me a moment here guys
okay so I'm back with a little slot
screwdriver so what I'm going to do to
remove these guys I'm just gonna pry
them up a little bit here
look that was easy
there we are just going to pull these
guys up whoo they jumped around look at
that little bedbugs beefy people so
before I take them off completely I'm
just going to note which way they are
installed so the little dot here is in
the bottom left so I'm going to go ahead
and install the new ones in the same
orientation as the existing ones there's
a tech tip for you when you're replacing
something install the new one the same
way the old one lives in there so there
they are so I've got my little dots on
the bottom left here so I'm going to go
ahead and position them in the right
position if I can if that's not too
challenging for me it may just be oh
he's stuck Oh hmm challenging never fear
there we are
okay let's try this again so maybe I'll
do the bottom one first cuz that one
looks easier so let's line up the one
side and then the other side should go
in you've got to give the legs a bit of
a squeeze and then we can push that in
okay so whoa I just hit my lens awesome
last thing I need is more scratches on
this lens give me a second here guys
okay I got it guys just needed to give
it a little bit more pressure and there
you go it is now firmly seated so you
just want to check both sides ah I'm
just inspecting it a little closer right
now okay yeah so you can just inspect
both sides make sure those legs are in
there right
now you are and now we'll go ahead and
put in our other one being sure to put
it in the correct orientation let's
squeeze the legs closed a little bit
because I know this I had a little bit
of trouble getting the other one in with
them so wide-set there we go just make
sure they're positioned in the right
place and then go ahead and push down
firmly oh you know what see that one
went in a lot further I don't know if
the other ones quite in the right place
actually hmm okay let's try pulling up
the first one this is the problem with
doing guides when you haven't actually
done something before okay so there you
have it but okay guys sorry I got it
figured out what happened was the legs
of this one were a little bit wide and
they were getting caught on the on the
plastic housing around the op-amps lot
so now it is figured out they are both
in firmly and securely so all that's
left is to further shroud back on and
enjoy the upgraded sound quality
remember these pieces are the ones that
are actually going to determine the
overall in a lot of ways the overall
quality and the overall flavor of the
sound coming out of your sound card so I
look forward to trying them out thanks
