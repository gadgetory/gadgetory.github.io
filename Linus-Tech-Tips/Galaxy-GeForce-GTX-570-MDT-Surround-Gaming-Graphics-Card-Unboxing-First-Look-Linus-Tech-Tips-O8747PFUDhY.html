late to be unboxing a GTX 570 but this
one has a bit of a twist that you guys
might find interesting who knows so this
is the galaxy MDT gtx 570 scott 1280
Meg's of RAM just like most gtx 570s
it's got a test form inside which is not
actually for you guys but rather for my
use it has some foam and has wind split
settings so this is interesting but
we'll get into more about that a little
bit later
it also has the MDT series exclusive
software settings guide which is also
interesting but we'll get into that a
little bit more later graphics card
driver and then wind split revolution
software installation just this you
might actually need although you should
download the latest if available from
galaxy it's a website okay so let's go
ahead and see what we got for adapters
we got a DVI to VGA we've got a mini
HDMI to HDMI these are gold-plated this
sub only HDMI one is this one's not the
HDMI one is a bold plated adapter though
it's got a nice little extras go a long
way so we've got dual molex to PCIe
eight pin and then we've got dual molex
to PCIe six pin just in case you don't
have the appropriate PCI Express slots
on your arm slots connectors on your
power supply although if you're still
using a power supply that suddenly got
molex connectors to plug into your
graphics card it's probably time to
think about upgrading and is very
interesting about this particular video
card so the 570 is still by all rights a
high performance graphics card but it's
always had a bit of a disadvantage in
the market compared to its competition
from AMD and that is that the gtx 570
has never supported more than two
displays out at a time for surround
gaming unless you buy two of them so how
did gala
see see fit to address this we'll check
this out they put four DVI connectors
one mini HDMI as well although that's
less relevant and I'll talk about that
in a little bit
four DVI connectors on this card making
it capable of driving up to three
displays and surround plus an additional
monitor which is very very cool I mean I
suppose you could run the four displays
at a time but that wouldn't be very
beneficial because you'd have a bezel
like right in the middle so this is a
gaming card it's intended for gaming so
I'm going to go ahead and say that I
think the intended use is probably four
three displays at 1080p in a surround
gaming mode so how they achieve this
well one they have a custom designed
card so you can see this is a completely
non reference card with four DVI
connectors on it as well as an
aftermarket cooler so here there you go
you guys can have a look at the cooler
so it's got an eighty millimeter fan and
a very beefy and very heavy heatsink
going on here so check this out we've
got one two heat pipes three heat pipes
it's hard to kind of see those in there
how many heat pipes do we have total can
you see in there four heat pipes total I
think it's four heat pipes total yeah
yeah so four heat pipes total including
so two coming out to the left here or to
the right and then two coming out to the
left very dense aluminum fin array on
both sides as well as a downward draft
fan that is actually very cleverly
positioned because it's almost directly
over the PWM so while we can use these
heat pipes that are positioned directly
above the GPU to distribute that heat to
the rest of the fins we use the fans
direct cooling in order to keep the
voltage regulators cool enough so that's
pretty much it for that part of the card
so let's get back to the display so you
have a couple different options you can
run them normally so you can see there's
dvi-i DVID one DVID two and DVID three
you can either run hmm to DV is three DV
is two DV is in an HDMI or you can run 4
DV eyes or three DD eyes and an HDMI
be back in a sec so there's a fair bit
of hocus-pocus that is going on with
this particular graphics card so in
order to achieve the whole triple
monitor gaming thing because really
that's how many monitors you can span a
single virtual display much like the way
I affinity works we've got these
numbered ones so we've got DVID one two
and three and these guys are only good
up to 1920 by 1080 if you're running
three at a time so bear that in mind
1080p monitors are the most you're going
to be able to do triple displays on
however it should be noted that with a
GTX 570 level graphics card unless
you're running more than one card you're
probably only going to want three 1080p
monitors anyway you're not going to run
330 inches off something like this okay
so you either run two displays plus one
which runs off either these or you run
three displays plus one that runs off
either these so this is great for I used
to play a fair man the supreme commander
so if I wanted to run triple monitor and
then have my mini-map displayed on an
additional one that is how I would do it
because Supreme Commander was multi
display capable whereas if you have a
game like race driver grid you would
only be able to run it off one monitor
and then you might be able to have like
task manager or whatever displayed it
depends on whether the game is multi
display compatible or not so these guys
create one virtual display these guys
are a secondary monitor so I hope that
that's clear now galaxy does provide a
couple pieces of software the both the
win split as well as the easy easy why
easy wide display software settings so
you can use that in order to configure
everything properly because it's not
built into the GeForce driver this is a
galaxy exclusive technology which is one
of the reasons I don't know if you guys
have noticed but this is the first time
I've ever looked at a galaxy card but
this is one of the reasons why I think
this one is so neat because unlike any
other GeForce card other than the GTX
590 which is kind of cheating because it
has two GPUs on it to achieve its
surround gaming glory this one supports
surrounds so it is a direct competitor
and it is completely feature competitive
against any AMD card because not only
does it have 3d vision and all that good
stuff it also has high affinity which I
don't know what to call it I mean we'll
call it invidious around
yes because that's what it's called then
you have two cards but it's got it on a
single card so since I've never talked
about galaxy before I should probably
mention a couple other things so they've
got 24/7 365 tech support for US and
Canada only I don't know about other
territories guys extreme tuner HD so
they've got some overclocking software
they also have a one-click ezy buttons
ultra simple multi display window
management so that's that software that
they included and then they've also got
a couple of other cool things so they've
got a dual BIOS we're used to seeing
these on motherboards now but it's not
that often we see it on graphics cards
and you started doing it on some of
their cards on the very high end but
here we go there's galaxy adding it to
Nvidia cards when no one else has it
power meter allows you to monitor the
entire card's status and power
consumption and voltage settings so for
full control for extreme overclockers I
don't know how many extreme overclockers
are gonna need a card like this because
they aren't typically running for
displays at a time but there you go I
guess the options are there so thank you
for checking out this unboxing and first
look at the in Gotham video well it is
Nvidia Nvidia galaxy geforce gtx 570 MDT
