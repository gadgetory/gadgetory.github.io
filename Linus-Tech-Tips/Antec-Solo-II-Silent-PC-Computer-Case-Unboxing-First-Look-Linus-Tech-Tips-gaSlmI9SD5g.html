quite excited about this is the antic 25
no no just an intact they're just
celebrating their quarter century of
quality and innovation which i think is
very fair to say with a little 25 after
their logo but this is the solo 2 which
sounds like an upgraded solo but what it
actually is is the quietest case they've
ever produced it also has a lot of
features that we have yet to see for
manTech and some features that have
become an tech staples so we've got
internal USB 3 headers on this guy which
is a first for an tech and then we've
also got some previous innovations where
they're basically taking everything they
know about silent computing cases and
they are putting it in here so the
stickers really in my way but let's say
a few things first ok so there's a dual
layer design so it's a 1 millimeter
steel splash polycarbonate top inside
that panel design what that does is an
isolate 8 and Evans noise so we saw
multi-layer panels introduced on the P
180 so this is an older innovation we
also have dual hard drive mounting
options so you can either use grommets
or even a suspension to March mount your
hard drives we've seen this in the past
so that is not really a new thing either
here we have an anodized aluminum front
panel which is something that is
relatively new for an Tek because they
don't really do the aluminum front
panels but it's a my okay based on the
pictures I've seen so far we're gonna
get the case up in a minute looks like
it's gonna look awesome we've also got a
matte black interior which they've
started doing on their higher-end cases
finally high-end IO so two front panel
USB three parts with internal
motherboard connector for unparalleled
data transmission that might be a little
bit of an overstatement unparalleled
data transmission I mean there are
things that are faster than USB 3 but I
see where they are coming from and it's
certainly better than having those USB 3
connectors that are more of a of a
pass-through rather than using a proper
internal header which most of the new
motherboards you're p67
sixty-eight motherboards are gonna
support just fine terms of packing
material we've got about an inch of foam
on all sides of the case looks good
and let's pull up the case itself now
based on some of the reviews that I've
seen in this guy supposedly it is even
better than the Sonata series the
quietness case ever produced by an tech
so that is a very serious claim and
let's have a look at how they have
achieved that so first of all they've
achieved it by confusing me about which
direction it opens from there we go this
baby open that looks nice
that is actually a very very nice front
panel finish so hold on let's start with
the parts that are less interesting like
the manual and that's pretty much it
okay so we have a piano black powder
coat finish on the top so you can see on
the top we actually have an exhaust vent
here like we see white like we saw in
the original p180 no shroud on it just a
regular exhaust vent the sides are also
piano black a glossy finish here we are
you can see that there the whole case is
using very soft I did want that
therefore now I can move closer if it
helps oh very very soft rubber grommet
so that should actually dead in any
vibration being passed from the case to
the table or the desk then it is
positioned on its gonna run through the
specs really quick with you here guys
so elegant appearance yeah we can see
that dual harddrive mounting system
using trained mount with pre-installed
silicon grommets or suspension mounts
tomb external five-and-a-quarter this is
something I really like to see fewer
five and a quarter inch because most
people are not installing a ton of five
and a quarter inch devices something
like you know your drive and then maybe
a fan controller is about all you really
need so instead they've taken more of
that internal space that's available to
them and they've allocated it instead of
to stuff that people are less likely to
use here is the internal design so
there's your ear plastic layer as well
as your metal layer that plastic layer
is going to help to
sound okay so instead they've allocated
it to longer video cards so you can
install a huge video card in this case
with no complications and then more
options for mounting your three and a
half inch drives very very good idea
right there
next we have got the removable power
supply support beam so I'll have a look
at that in a minute
front accessible flip down drive cages
it's a front accessible flip down drive
cage guess we'll find out give me a sec
I'm gonna have to figure out how to open
this there we go I figured out how to
open it so there's just a few little uh
few little tabs here so you just bend
those back you open up the whole thing
and there is the flip down front
accessible hard drive bays now you can
also see you can install a 120mm fan
here and then for additional internal
cooling and this is really neat because
this looks like a case that doesn't have
much ventilation on the surface but for
additional cooling you can throw another
fan here in the front which is going to
directly blow cool air onto your
graphics card and when you look at this
from the side you can see there's
actually significant ventilation space
not only on the right hand side but also
on the left hand side of the front panel
so those fans are not going to be
starved for air but by blocking the
entire front of the case you're going to
reduce the amount of noise that gets
transmitted directly to someone sitting
in front of it so let's have a look a
closer look at the front so we I don't
know how to get you guys a good angle on
this but this is a really neat finish so
you it's not like very coarse brushed
lines it's very very very fine fine
brush lines on the anodized aluminum
which actually has a very cool a very
sort of matte look until you get really
really close and then you can see the
brush is kind of a neat effect we have a
hard drive led here power reset front
audio ports USB 3 and front USB 2
there's your stamp tantek logo and that
pretty much does it for the front of the
case oh look at that more ventilation
down there so because you're held up by
these feet you're going to be able to
get a little bit more fresh air to that
bottom fan which as I mentioned before
there is going to be blowing directly
over your graphics card so
have a look at the internal layout take
all of our included screws some zip ties
some good stuff like that for building
your PC back here we've also got out
here okay so you can either install
three drives using the trays or you can
use the suspension mounting system which
is included with the accessories here to
install two drives given that most
people are not at this time installing
more than a couple of drives I mean
especially if you're building a new
system you can buy you know three
terabyte hard drives these days what's
the incentive to install you know eight
drives in your system so here we go oh
no there's the suspension you know what
let's go ahead I'm gonna reopen this
from the front here and I'll show you
guys the suspension system so I didn't
screw this all the way back in
unfortunately so that'll save us some
time so yeah if you're not installing a
ton of drives you just pull these guys
out
there's the grommets so that's the one
way of mounting these are compatible two
and a half inch drives as well you can
see the spacing there for your two and a
half inch SSDs or even hard drives and
then here is the suspension system so
you run your drives through these and
what that does is it completely isolates
any vibrations from the drive away from
your case I mean don't transport your
system around like that that's more for
stationary systems in your office you
know don't expect to ship it across the
country using the suspension but it's
there as an option in case you want it
in terms of the rest of the internal
layout we've got our front panel
connectors here including an internal
USB three header right there so that's
going to plug directly into your
motherboard instead of routing around
the back to the i/o shield as well as
your front USB to your front audio and
then your front panel switches for your
power you reset all of that good stuff
we have an enormous cutout for CPU
heatsink mounting options so if you have
a backplate there is no way with this
case you are going to have to remove
your motherboard in order to install a
CPU cooler with a backplate you just
take off your other side panel and you
screw the backplate in from the back and
no worries about that okay you know here
give me a sec I'll be back with the
videocard so here's a Radeon 69 94 scale
to show you guys how much extra space
there is in this case four ginormous
video cards so no worries as far as
that's concerned as long as you've got
some external exhaust going you can draw
fresh air in from the front and you are
good to go we've also got an included a
detect ride pool fan you can see the
little trike pull switch is built into
the back here so we've got oh no that's
that cool cool so it's got a high and a
low setting on the back of the case and
it's also got built-in silicone grommets
so check this out so you're actually
mounting it using grommets and then it
also has Isolators see the orange
Isolators here on either side to keep it
away from the case whether you have an
exhausting air or whether you turn it
around and use a water cool like beyond
water cooler like the enttec 620 or 920
you turn that around draw in fresh air
for to cool your CPU and it's going to
still be isolated from the case all
right we have a power supply support bar
here which you can remove just by taking
out a couple screws if you do not need
it and that's pretty much oh this is
smart I didn't even notice what this was
for so what this is for
is so you can take a power supply with a
120mm fan and you can mount it either
way and that 120mm fan is going to take
in fresh air so this is kind of like a
bottom mounted power supply but it's in
the top that's very very cool so what it
means is your power supply takes fresh
air here blows it out the back and
doesn't interfere with the cooling of
your system at all very neat feature
seven PCI expansion slots though that
standard and then you've got your two
lifts part optical drive mounting rails
here and I think that pretty much covers
