launch day I have two windows RT devices
remember RT it looks like Windows 8 it
behaves a lot like Windows 8 but it is
not quite Windows 8 because Windows RT
is the first operating system that we've
seen from Microsoft ready in every way
for ARM processors the first device
we're going to have a look at is the
Zeus vivo Tab RT so this is a Seuss's
take on the whole Windows RT paradigm we
have it in the dark color here so
there's also more of a champagne color
available you can see based on the box
it's apparently quite slim once we get
it open well basically be able to
validate that unlike most tablets
Windows RT actually takes up a
significant amount of the storage space
that is available on the device so
there's a little warning here that the
available user capacity of a 32 gig SKU
will actually be significantly less than
that about half I think that's a little
bit pessimistic but they're probably
planning for the worst-case scenario so
this is a full-fledged Windows OS guys
umm TF 600 T is the part number it comes
with the T 30 that's a Tegra 3 processor
there won't be a 16 gig version
available at all because as you guys can
imagine if it was completely full of Els
and there was no room for apps that
wouldn't be very helpful all Windows RT
devices are shipping with a full office
implementation that includes Word Excel
PowerPoint and OneNote OneNote being of
particular interest because as a
note-taking platform tablets are
obviously less than ideal with what
we've seen in the past so far with the
exception being maybe something like a
Galaxy Note 10.1 that has that
integrated stylus okay so there's the
hold on hold on let's get everything
let's get everything out first so
there's the device itself it's very thin
here's the documentation the microfiber
cloth for cleaning that is included but
I'll stick out here warranty card
warranty card again includes a user's
guide as well that gives you some basic
actually this is kind
interesting so there's some gestures
left edge swipe right edge swipe top
edge swipe and finger slides then scroll
up and down zoom out zoom in tap and
hold double tap neat explains the charm
bar so we can we can show some of this
side some of this after okay user's
manual okay that's enough for
documentation it includes the heck is
that
Oh neat okay so you can adapt a Seuss's
charging connector right somewhere where
the heck is a charging connector right
here to a USB port that's awesome
actually especially given the form
factor of the device and because this is
a windows-based device you will have
full access
there's your ia C's charging connector
your Asus charger you will have full
access to the file system that is
operating under your tablet OS which is
not something that we've seen in the
past on Android without third-party app
support and on iOS at also in terms of
thinness I'm going to go ahead I'm going
to do it I'm going to do it I'm going to
do the old iPhone 4 thickness comparison
as well as the old iPhone for size
comparison so this is a 10 inch tablet
it is extremely light actually it's
maybe not as not actually yeah no this
is this is extremely light it's very
comparable to something like a Galaxy
Tab 10.1 which is again a very very
light tablet let's see what Isis has to
say for themselves so Tegra 3 quad core
processor super IPS plus ultra bright
178 degree viewing angle panel 8
megapixel rear camera that's a 2
megapixel front camera right there
Sonic Master crystal pure sound
reproduction and the battery life at
lasts up to 9 hours NFC is on board so
you can tap and share without boundaries
we're waiting for it to boot up right
now there's only one actual button built
into Windows RT devices and that is the
windows button right here on the back
you can see they've gone with a hybrid
metal and plastic finish so the metal
part is actually here I should just what
is this this is an FCC thing maybe I'll
leave that one on but this one just
covers up the powered by Windows RT
edging on that really
wow that's really hard to remove so
there's a brushed metal backing and then
up at the top and I can pretty much
guarantee you that the antennas are
hidden under that that housing is a
plastic backing that actually has a
really nice grip enos to it okay that
came off so the powered by Windows RT is
not actually etched onto there it's just
the Asus logo and then that brushed
finish the speakers are built into what
I would say is kind of a funny location
because this tablet as you can tell from
the way that it's set up the way that
this button is here and the webcam is
here is meant to be used in portrait
mode and the way that I would most
naturally use a tablet in portrait mode
is holding it like this which would
perfectly exactly cover up both of the
speakers so those are probably going to
be a little bit muffled I would have
preferred to see them up here or
something like that but you know if you
have pulled it like this while you're
watching a movie or you hold it a little
bit higher you might be able to get away
with with not covering those up so
here's the setup process at any rate you
can accept the terms of the you left or
of course carefully reading them just
like any device that you set up that you
of course carefully read here's a few
basics yeah color scheme sweet let's go
through ink and then PC name will be
vivo input is very snappy okay we can
pick a wireless access point you know
what our wireless give me a sec guys
because our wireless isn't working
correctly here alright so we got
connected to Wi-Fi we're just going to
use Express settings to set up and you
are they're going to want you to use a
Microsoft account to sign in okay so
I'll enter this for this next part I
want to show you guys a couple of the
different keyboard layouts that are
available on Windows RT so this is sort
of your classic tablet layout they
haven't committed any cardinal sins here
they've added smiley faces which is
actually probably more useful than you'd
think I really like the way they've
implemented the number pad because as
much as it's you know you can have a row
numbers up here and it's convenient
enough to press an additional button if
you're entering more than one number at
a time I I love this and being able to
reach it with just one hand they seem to
have made pretty good choices for all of
the main symbol
here so you got your - and your
underscore available your asterisk at
sign hashtags all that good stuff and
then they've also got this lay out this
load I'm not quite sure what to think
about I think I wish that these bottom
parts were smaller to go along with the
smaller letters and maybe make the
letters a bit bigger but even with my
small hands I can reach all of them and
some I've seen some people complain
about this number pad in the middle
because it does take away from how much
space is available on the screen but as
someone who actually inputs numbers on a
regular basis I don't think I mind it so
let's just go ahead and we'll enter a
user name and we'll be right back
there's a little guide thing it says
while we're getting your system ready
here's a little guide so you swipe in
from any edge so swiping in from the
right accesses the charms bar which is
your search your windows key your
settings or some other handy stuff there
okay so it actually wants me to do it
how does it think I'm oriented here
swipe in from any edge come on
oh no it's just timed okay we're getting
your PC ready this will take a few
minutes we'll be back so here we are
booted into Windows 8 it's extremely
smooth which is nice it looks like
everything's animating at a very fast
framerate it looks like they just do
away with animations that might have
ended up choppy so I mean what we saw
especially on earlier iterations of
Android it's stuff like this would just
kind of like sort of turn itself around
like that but they've just kind of gone
nope we're just going to kind of back it
off and then pop it back up in a way
that is oriented more according to how
the user wanted it I want to just show
you guys some of the swipe gestures so
on the right you can see search share
start devices and settings so a quick
setting that I do want to adjust right
now is screen brightness let's crank
that up so you guys can see a little
better I love the way they've
implemented things like volume and
screen brightness where you just hold it
and then dial it in to wherever you want
and then see so with just like one touch
you can almost mute and go all the way
to maximum just like that well classic
little Windows tone for doing that kind
of stuff same thing with brightness so
it'll adjust the slider
according to where you are and then you
can adjust it from there which is just I
think it's kind of neat can change your
keyboard okay touch keyboard and
handwriting panel you can change your
notification settings hide for whatever
else once you're actually inside apps
and I apologize we actually my phone
tethering is broken broken my stupid
iPhone but you can access your tab
browsing from here I've seen this
approach complained about because it
requires an extra keystroke but I'm
actually not convinced that it's that
bad of an idea because I don't switch
between tabs all that often when I'm on
a mobile device swiping up from the
bottom is also kind of application
contextual so in this case it brings up
the browser bar as well as your internet
settings however you cannot access all
of your internet settings just on the on
the mobile the modern UI browser you
actually have to use the desktop browser
in order to access some of the more
advanced settings so more on that in a
moment
swiping in from the right allows you to
manage your mouth
to tasking so let's go back to the Start
menu and there's another way to do that
you can use the one button that's here
to go back to Start menu as well once
you're on the desktop yes it's a Windows
desktop however Windows RT is not
backwards compatible with previous
Windows applications that are not
designed for arm and every app you
install on this device does have to come
from the windows when the Microsoft
Store so internet options that's how you
would actually change any of those
options here everything is very smooth
though and the touch screen is extremely
accurate on this particular tablet so I
don't think you'll have any difficulty
navigating around and changing your
security settings or whatever else that
you need to do from the desktop is where
you actually access all of your office
apps as well these haven't been Metro
Eyes door modernized so you'll they look
just like the desktop applications
I really recommend getting something
like the keyboard dock for the if for
the vivo tab if you're going to
seriously use office but if you're not
then you know it's still nice to have
it's nice to have all those tools I
personally like the ribbon interface
although not everyone not everyone does
but the current iterations are so much
better than the original ones back in
2007 that you can do pretty much
everything which is just just great to
have that kind of productivity available
on the tablet I talked about having full
access to the odd to the file structure
of the device so you can go into my
computer and then you can even just go
like browse your hard drive all your
stuffs just there it's just in like
Windows and you know browse around look
around like that can you zoom oh you can
although the way the zooming works is
sort of gimpy but let's just sort of do
away with that for now and pressing this
button again gets you back into the
modern UI where they set up a bunch of
stuff for you so there's Kindle apps
pre-installed on this one so there's a
Kindle app available there's a lot of
apps that weren't available yet when
reviewers had their initial review units
but the store should be open now but of
course we aren't connected to the
Internet which will make that demo is
somewhat difficult so we'll just go back
to back to the main UI
now we're tethering to camera man's
phone just to sort of show a little bit
of the browser experience so these
aren't super high resolution devices
this is only 1366 by 768 it does still
look reasonably sharp though it's not
it's not as noticeable as I sort of
would have expected but it's not an iPad
and it's not a TF 700 display where
we're talking super super high res
displays zooming and panning around is
extremely smooth very responsive I don't
want you guys to judge the the
navigation speed based on what we're
seeing right here because we are
tethered to a phone right now in a room
that has just so much interference in it
let's go ahead and sort of show what the
tab based switching is like so it's
really quick to switch between tabs that
personally doesn't bother me at all if
you do want to open a new tab you just
go like this type in your URL or type in
your search so I don't know ponies
ponies are great everyone likes ponies
and helps if you spell it right though
ponies and then you just go like that
does a Bing search by default so yep we
can learn about oh that's a cute pony
you know what let's let's lose the whole
pony thing now let's go back to Metro so
let's go to the store Metro not metro
modern UI let's go back to the store
load up the store and see if things look
a little bit more densely populated so
there you go you got your Netflix your
iHeartRadio Skype Skype better be
available on skype is actually one that
pretty much everyone should install
because of the convergence that I think
we're going to see with Skype and
Windows Live Messenger and all those
sort of messaging apps that are
available the one that's it still
doesn't work with is the integrated
messenger I mean doesn't work with
Google Talk so but we'll see if that
ever happens so New York Times
more Tier one sort of new sites still
need to get applications ready grew
remote desktop so that's that's a cool
thing to have available oh another thing
to note guys that yes this is a proper
browser so unlike Android and unlike
unlike iOS full flash is available on
Windows this is this is Internet
Explorer 10 so there's no limitations
you will see Flash content
and personally it still matters to me
it's flash isn't dead yet it might be
like a dead standard or a dying standard
but I still use it so it's it's nice to
have so let's have a look at all the
stuff physically around the edge of the
tablet this is your ejection port for
the docking keyboard this is your micro
SD slot here's a micro HDMI port which I
personally think is darn handy to have
on a device like this in case especially
yeah it's one of those things if you
ever want to do like a PowerPoint
presentation
it actually has PowerPoint unlike other
platforms so there's a power button okay
there's your three and a half inch or
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone -
a three and a half inch headphone jack
no big deal
3.5 millimeter headphone jack there's
your volume rocker and then on the
bottom you find there's your power and
then there's this all of this is part of
the docking for the keyboard add-on that
is available separately although I would
definitely recommend it because as a
Productivity tablet Windows RT is a much
stronger and more compelling option than
what we've seen from Android and iOS in
the past thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the vivo tab
