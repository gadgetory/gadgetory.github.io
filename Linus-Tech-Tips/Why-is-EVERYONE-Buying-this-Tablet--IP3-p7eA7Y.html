installment of a new series called why
the advertiser friendly content are you
buying this where we look at the number
one best-selling tech product in a given
category and try to figure out what the
heck and fuss is about let's start with
the top-selling tablet on amazon.com the
fire seven is priced at a weight really
only $40 good god
okay well that's probably at least part
of the answer but cheap does not equal
good value so let's see just why those
at least 32,000 people are so freaking
pleased with this thing
you
that's quite big looking for an
affordable and reliable VPN service
private Internet access encrypts your
Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP subscribe today at the link
below so let's take a moment to
appreciate how ludicrous it is that
Amazon sells these for a mere $40 a
regardless of the exact spec this is a
complex device that no one person could
hope to make in the 1 to 4 hours that it
would take to earn one it is a truly
amazing time to be alive there is a
reason that it's cheap though spec wise
the seventh-generation fire 7 from 2017
is pretty comparable to a nexus 7 tablet
from 2012 but that doesn't mean that it
lacks modern features outright for
starters it's got Amazon's AXA assistant
built-in which makes it a portable touch
and voice remote for your smart home and
that's actually about it so why the
bestseller spot well the main appeal of
any tablet is the size and while this
one screen is only a little over an inch
bigger than some flagship phones these
days it still makes a big difference
based on the reviews most people are
buying one of these for casual web
browsing ebook reading and movie
watching and if you view the bargain
price tag as a key feature frankly it is
what I would describe as suitably
adequate for those use cases now if
you're a seasoned technophile like me
with strong opinions about electronic
specs you'll probably hate it at least
on first glance I mean you'll be
watching videos in standard definition
rather than even 720p HD the speaker is
probably worse than your phone and it is
singular speaker not stereo and
even reading on the thing gets fatiguing
after a while because it has the same
number of pixels as an iPhone 4s but
those pixels are spread over twice the
area which makes for some blurry letters
however let's say that you want an
Internet Ingush een on your next trip
but you don't want to bring along one of
your more premium devices or let's say
that you want to you know cheap but
surprisingly rugged tablet for the kids
or the cat the fire seven is great for
that and you can even order a kid proof
case to go with it
it's even cheap enough to give as a gift
to relatives who still have cabinets
full of VHS tapes or I mean heck you can
even buy several of them for some
much-needed peace and quiet no we do
still have some grapes first you need to
be prepared to shell out some extra cash
Ola for a decent microSD card because
eight gigs or even the sixteen gig
version will fill up pretty darn quickly
from apps alone
never mind movies second speed isn't
exactly the fire seven strong point it
performs exactly like you'd expect from
something with one quarter of the RAM of
most modern phones and a processor that
was designed primarily for wearables
third while it does have both rear and
front mounted cameras
ahem they probably should have included
a peeler in the box for them because
quality wise it's a total potato show I
mean point three megapixels what is
point three megapixels should we even be
measuring that in megapixels or kilo
pixels
now available with 300 teal pixels
even this bottom-of-the-barrel hardware
though doesn't fully explain why this
thing is so cheap for that we need to
look at the software unlike Apple Amazon
isn't a hardware company at its core so
everything about this device including
the non-google off' ID version of
android that is running is about driving
customers back to other Amazon services
that's why your fire 7 is loaded with
apps like Prime video Prime photos and
prime music that's why you get
notifications related to your Amazon
orders and that's why by default any way
you are forced to download any
additional apps from the Amazon App
Store instead of the Google Play Store
giving Amazon the 30% commission on app
sales instead of Google that is how they
can afford to sell this thing for so
cheap
not only are they using objectively
cheap internals I mean there are a lot
of reviews complaining about fire sevens
that stops charging or broke all
together shortly after the warranty
expired but this ecosystem control is
such a powerful motivator that Amazon
actually subsidizes every tablet they
sell then pushes the price down another
$15 with the with special offers version
that puts ads on your lockscreen so
should you become one of the tens maybe
even hundreds of thousands of people who
own one or several fire seven tablets
it's not amazing our first unit was
actually inexplicably missing the a
assistant for some reason with Amazon's
response being no I don't know I guess
trade it in for another one but if you
want a basic no-frills or like you know
utility tablet for the coffee table and
you don't have an extra 20 spot burning
a hole in your pocket for the large
higher-capacity fire HD 8 it really is a
good value freshbooks is the small
