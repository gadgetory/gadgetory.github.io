brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital hey guys i'm here with
our first video at CES with christian to
show us tracker which is pretty
interesting i was interested the second
i show up to the booth because i
constantly lose my keys i'm pretty good
my wallet I'm pretty good with my phone
but I literally can never find my keys
so how does this work so Luke we've got
a solution for you you attach the
sticker tracker to your keys or a bag
anything that you want to keep track of
you can even stick it on a remote the
app will find that thing at the press of
a button so you press a button on the
app and then it makes it beep so you can
see where you know did you leave it in
the couch cushions did you you know did
it fall under the table and then you can
see with a hot cold indicator on the app
if you're getting warmer or colder and
then if you leave it behind and
remembers we're on a map you left that
thing so this works through bluetooth
and you said the battery life was pretty
insane how long is the battery life for
that little tracker it goes up to a year
on a little watch battery so you don't
have to worry about constantly plug it
into your computer or whatever the wall
to charge it which is actually really
nice because you might lose somethin for
a few days and having these kind of
things and having them die is really not
that helpful so there's another thing
you're talking about where you can kind
of help other people find stuff just
like ways and how does that work so in
the latest tracker app we've
incorporated social tracking we're
calling it crowd tracker so if I left my
keys somewhere and you walked by them
then you wouldnt onimous Lee and
confidentially just let me know where my
keys move to so you can see on this
little map I've got my tracker on a map
and that knows where I left it and then
if another user walks by it gives me an
updated location for that thing cool so
if it's Bluetooth but it doesn't have to
fully connect it just has to kind of
ping and then it updates the map without
that user actually knowing and this is
an opt-in correct so if you're kind of
worried about it you can say no correct
yeah so if you're interested in having
other people help you find your stuff
when you lose it then you can help other
people find their stuff when they lose
it
perfect so you if you're someone who
tends to leave things behind like myself
this might help you a lot i also heard
that it's pretty inexpensive so how much
are the different devices we wanted to
make it really easy for people that keep
track of their stuff so one device is 29
and it's 24 39 + 44 eighty dollars
perfect that's really not that bad I
don't think I don't know about you is
this kind of stuff you're interested in
