fractal designs update to one of my
favorite like awesomely cool cases that
I really liked ever the array r2 so the
array r2 was unique because it was a
mini ITX enclosure that was capable of
housing an expansion card such as a rape
part I did an ultimate Windows Home
Server built in the array are two a
while back it was an all aluminum
chassis which has the advantage of being
lightweight but the disadvantage of
being relatively fragile and very
expensive and it could also house six
hard drives in spite of its incredibly
small size this is the node three or
four so the node three or four builds on
that impressive lineage and updates it
to make it more cost-effective as well
as to add the capability to install
high-end graphics cards something the
array r2 was not capable of doing so it
comes with a hard foam however it's a
very small very light case so in this
solution I wouldn't worry about it too
much
it does seem to be a little bit bigger
than the array are to but that yeah of
the array or to that is to be expected
given that it's well the supports more
stuff okay so there's a thing in the
event of something something call us in
something ok users manual
good stuff cool beans all right got some
plastic here ok very excited about this
though guys very excited indeed the
array r2 also had a fairly outdated IO
set so this one updates all of that so
we've got indicator power LED fractal
design logo very tasteful very small
brushed metal front which looks
fantastic it's in is it metal yeah it's
metal power button is on the side two
USB 3.0 ports headphone and microphone
ports intake vent on this side which ah
yes so this one's on this side for a
good reason
like this one's small on this side for a
good reason you want most of the intake
coming in over where your graphics card
is going to be if you do opt to put in a
large graphics card at the bottom of the
case has a nice big fan filter which you
can see is that magnetic hold on
no it just comes in and just pops into
these little Clips right there it feels
good feels nice and snug so once you put
it in it's not much effort to remove it
but then once it's there it's not going
to go anywhere accidentally or anything
nice big rubber feet one two three four
of those so once you put it down it's
going to be quite stationary at the back
you're going to find yes a 140
millimeter fan very good stuff and
fractal has also ensured that this fan
is going to be compatible with liquid
cooling solutions so you can use
something like an h-60 for example in
this case without any difficulty thumb
screws are hand tight which is nice nice
to be able to remove these out running
and fetching screwdrivers let's go ahead
and pull this off so use this kind of a
modular design inside to here hold on
first this is very well built this feels
very sturdy compared to sort of some of
the lower end ITX enclosures that i've
looked at over the last little while
this is a removable filter right here so
you'll be able to pop that off clean it
and put it back this one does not have
the removable filter however most of
your intake like I said before you're
going to want to come through this side
anyway so your cooling off that graphics
card so let's talk about the modular
interface inside so this one can still
house up to six hard drives - in each of
these cages which hopefully I will be
able to remove you know what I'm going
to be my screwdriver all right there we
go loosen them with the screwdriver so
like I said each of these can hold two
three and a half inch or two and a half
inch drives it's compatible with either
and once you remove properly goes one
more
once you remove this one you can install
up to a three hundred and ten millimeter
graphics card so that's over let's yeah
over 12 inches actually so you could
even take something like a GTX 580 to be
a great example of a longer edge
graphics card and it'll go in there very
very comfortable you see that
hassle whatsoever and you're going to
have an intake directly coming over the
cart so you can see the way they
position the fan here it's going to be
blowing over the front somewhat also
this intake fan here is going to be able
to suck air directly from that vent
that's right next to it so you're not
going to have to worry about your
graphics card temperatures like you do
with many ITX enclosures so the way the
harddrive mounting works is actually
quite clever so you screw the hard
drives in from either side and then
they'll sit facing opposite directions
inside these cages and you take the
whole thing and lower it into the case
I'm going to leave this one out for now
though just so oh yeah they're using
rubber isolating mounts so that's really
nice and there's a plane flying overhead
so hopefully you guys can hear me ok
let's finish up with the look at the
rest of the inside you might have
noticed already the absence of a sorry
I've drawn a blank here right the
absence of a five and a quarter inch
drive so I don't know if you're anything
like me you're probably not using a five
and a quarter inch drive anymore or you
can just get I mean they're like 15 20
bucks just get an external one for those
few situations where you do need one and
I think especially for an ITX
space-saving design like this it's
probably the right choice ventilation
for the front comes from here as well as
the bottom so I'm just going to peel
this off so you can see those two 92
millimeter fans which have a removable
if I can figure out how to remove it but
if I'm sure there's a way so they have a
removable fan filter on top of them that
you'll be able to take off and clean
this is quite easy to remove and all the
cables are let's see I think some of
these look oh yeah no not permanently
attached so if you ever wanted to not
enou change them or you broke them
accidentally or something you'd be able
to deal with that let's go ahead and
throw this back on here there we go
rest of the interior so let's figure out
what the power supply goes AHA full ATX
power supply BAM
take that other small form-factor
enclosures because the ITX board goes
here and then they've routed internally
a power cable right here that's going to
go into the back of your power supply
which sits here that is why you have
that vent on the other side because that
is the exhaust for the back of your
power supply so intake for the
our supply comes up through that
filtered intake on the bottom you're
going to want to use a power supply with
a bottom mounted 120 or 140 millimeter
fan for this particular case you can
actually have up to quite a long power
supply without running into any
difficulty see they've got foam ISIL
nose isolating mounts here here and well
here and here to keep it from putting
any undue pressure on the mounting
mechanism and that is that is actually
outstanding I love that very very very
innovative design so they put the power
supply right under the drives and then
you've got your ITX board and you got
your long graphics card so as long as
your power supplies and super super long
I mean you could still be able to have
you know something about this long like
not bad at all then you won't have any
trouble fitting all the hardware you
could want in this tiny little enclosure
including liquid cooling should you so
desire it and all the fans are
controlled from this high medium low
built-in fan speed adapter here at the
back and I think that pretty much covers
it thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the extremely exciting and
very cool fractal design note 304 which
as I mentioned before is also extremely
well built I mean these are thick steel
right here your hard drives aren't going
