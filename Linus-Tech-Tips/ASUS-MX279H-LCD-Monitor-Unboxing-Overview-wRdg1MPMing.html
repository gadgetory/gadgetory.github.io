unboxing ever this is the Asus designo
series mx2 7:9 and what's bold and
daring about our unboxing of it is the
fact that we're doing it outside pretty
much in the rain now I didn't realize
that this is just going to open up like
this I've never seen an LCD box that's
configured quite like this so let's have
a look at what they have to say for
themselves on the outside of the box
first audio is by Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen with
their ice power technology so there's
two three watt speakers that are
actually on the back of the monitor but
they use quite a large speaker size in
order to get deeper bass it uses a
frameless design which is 0.8
millimetres or some 0.8.0 eight inches
or something like that
for the frame so we're going to show you
that after it uses an IPS screen with
motion blur reduction technology that
makes it suitable for gaming in spite of
the fact that it is IPS not TN an LED
backlight a 178 degree viewing angle and
of course a 5 millisecond response time
so let's check this out first of all
we've got a Seuss's warranty card which
we're not going to worry too much about
next we've got an HDMI to DVI cable this
is an interesting inclusion and the
reason they've done this is if you want
to come closer and have a look at the
accessories just yeah pick it up and
come on over the reason they've done
this is that the monitor itself doesn't
actually have a DVI input so you'll run
this DVI cable to your video card or
other device and this HDMI connection
into the back of the monitor so that's
why they that's why they include that
they also include there we go a VGA
cable just in case you're still using
one of those but please don't this is
such a beautiful monitor it's just
wasted just utterly wasted on that
three-and-a-half millimeter audio
connection a power brick so there is no
power supply built in to of the monitor
itself this is because it is so slim
that there wasn't enough room to even
integrate this and then a power cable
for that next up we've got the ring
which is actually modeled after like
kind of a Sun
dile inspired design so you guys are
going to see what I mean as soon as I
open it up it looks just like a sundial
and then the monitor sits forward on it
like this
it's got rubberized grips on the bottom
so it's not going anywhere once you put
it in place and then assembly looks like
it's going to be super simple with one
screw in the bottom that holds the
entire monitor onto the top so let's go
ahead and enjoy the uniqueness of this
packaging here which has thrown me off a
little bit because I was not expecting
it to be quite like this you can see the
monitor itself is protected by a hard
foam so we've got about here check this
out we've got a bow probably a little
over half an inch of foam protection
around the outside of the box
however monitor packaging has gotten
slimmer and lower profile as monitors
have continued to get slimmer and lower
profile and this monitor itself is
actually not that heavy so I don't
expect it to be that much of an issue so
this is what asus means by frameless
design check this out
there's the bezel that's it that's all
the screen looks matte from here but I
think what we're going to discover is
that there is a yeah there's a covering
over it so that film protector I'm
having a little bit of trouble getting
off at least I hope that's a protective
film yeah come on ah maybe I'm wrong
maybe I just won't do that we'll be back
in a moment
so we got rained on out there either way
it looks like the only removable plastic
film is on the back the front actually
the reason I couldn't get it off is that
it is an anti-glare coating so while
Asus has used a single panel for the
front of the monitor here in order to
make sure that it's very seamless and
very smooth they've gone for the route
where they don't want a super glossy
single panel and they've put an
anti-glare coating that is I guess
protective as well as reducing the the
reflections that makes it not I mean you
can see that you can't see a clear
reflection of my hand through the
monitor so we're going to have to fire
this up and see how it works I'm pretty
sited to check that out in terms of the
i/o because the monitor again is so thin
this is so this is the same reason we
ended up with a design that has the
power brick external at the back you're
going to see that there isn't really
much room to hide the inputs and outputs
so on the back we find HDMI one HDMI 2
and VGA the reason they've gone with
dual HDMI I think so this is just my
guess is that that way you can easily
hook up I like a computer and a game
console and switch between them at your
convenience VGA is just there for legacy
there is your line in as well as
headphones out if you don't want to use
the integrated speakers and DC volume in
and a Kensington lock the back is a
gloss finish in contrast to the front
which is that matte finish personally
I'd love to see less gloss and more
matte but if they're going to put gloss
somewhere I'm glad that it's on the back
because when you look at the side of the
monitor you actually can see again it's
matte so every part that you're going to
be looking at is going to be matte and
so it bothers me a lot less that way
let's do a cell phone size comparison so
this is the HTC one so you can see the
monitor is extremely slim and only
bulges out a little bit towards the
middle at the back where the i/o is and
other than that maintains its felt
profile now ok it should be noted guys
that the actual picture doesn't go quite
to the edge so there's about a pinky's
width of space here where there isn't
going to be an actual image but will
maybe show you that in more detail once
we've got it fired up so the
installation procedure I'll show you
guys a sous recommends putting it down
on a table I came up with the with the
cardboard idea myself because I'm not
comfortable putting something like this
directly down on the table because the
double-edged sword of having no bezel is
that you you have no bezel if you lay it
down on something you're basically
laying it down almost flat on the screen
although this bottom part here does
protrude out a little bit so it wouldn't
be it wouldn't be quite just flat on the
screen so there you go that's what it
looks like and we'll we'll fire it up in
a moment and give you guys our
impressions all the on-screen display
controls are here along the bottom they
are
tile button so you can actually feel
what you're pressing so that gives you
control of your brightness your input
your menu as well as your splendid
options so that's a Seuss's feature that
allows you to pick different different
picture profiles for it and then last
but not least it does have quick fit
which is a feature that we haven't seen
on anything other than pro art up till
now which puts gridlines on the screen
so you can easily size things up just by
looking at them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
