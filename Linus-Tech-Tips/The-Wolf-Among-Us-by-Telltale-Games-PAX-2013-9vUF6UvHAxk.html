brought to you by western digital Intel
and steelseries so we're here with Nick
Herman co-director of a wolf among us
also the walking dead and apparently a
million other things is that correct
yeah I guess we make a lot of games if
someone said it it must be true and it's
on the internet right sweet yeah yeah
it's only a million games so give me the
I guess give me the 30 to 60 second
pitch for ha why you want a gamer to
invest in the experience you guys are
delivering here yeah I mean with the
wolf among us we sort of you know we're
following the walking dead and I think a
lot of people are sort of putting the
pressure on us to make this good and I
think we instead of you know taking this
really dark and really serious I mean
the game actually is really dark and
serious so one was saying we wanted to
push it in a different direction it's
not it's not about you know it's there
to different characters right two
different stories Lee's you know a story
of sort of redemption and sort of being
someone's Savior and in this game i
think is is a little bit about
redemption in the fact that bigby wolf
who's the sheriff of Fabletown you know
he used to be the big battle and now
he's sort of in charge of protecting
everyone and it's and it's sort of up to
the player to figure out how they want
to do that like the problem with him
he's got all this power right and you
have to choose whether or not using that
power is worth it and and if when you do
what how that affects you know the
people around you want people think of
you and I think that's really
interesting and I mean with this game to
you can look at the art and it looks so
different the game feels different it's
a different story so I I think people
should just be excited for something new
and yeah now I played a 10 minute demo
of it here in the booth and the thing
that I noticed more than anything else
is looking for my screen to the guy next
to me is we were playing the same ten
minute demo and he had completely
different stuff on his screen whether
it's down to an option in the combat or
whether it's down to driving away in the
car versus falling out of window on top
of the car it felt like the choices I
was making we're having we're having a
huge impact on how the story was
progressing I mean you guys obviously
have a branching structure to it but are
there you know 101 endings or is it
pretty linear yeah I mean I would
it's closer to the walking dead I mean
we don't have I mean with episode of one
we don't have you know forty endings but
I think a lot of the things we're
playing around with our just giving the
player more choice more often letting
them sort of choose how they want to
play on more of a micro level a lot of
the times and something we're playing
with two is sort of the sense of time so
even in the demo when you're talking to
mr. toe downstairs you can leave the
conversation early in favor of sort of
getting to figure out what's going on or
you can sort of drill them a little bit
more and get more information and and
that comes into play in a much bigger
way later in the episode two fascinating
i mean asleep speaking of sense of time
the combat was felt very frantic felt
very urgent but didn't feel very
punishing because whenever i made a
mistake i was able to go back to about
you know three to five seconds ago and
and get a do-over so what does that say
about the experience you guys are trying
to deliver here yeah i mean with the
combat specifically it's really about I
mean we're not we don't want to punish
people for not being able to play an
action sequence I think most people play
our games for sort of the narrative and
the characters and the story and and
getting to make these decisions and yeah
I think I think it's really about in the
fight sequence just sort of creating
your own story I mean we now we have
this branching fight sequences really
just to let the player express
themselves more like i was saying more
on a micro level and even if you get the
shit kicked out of you it's still fun to
watch right it's still it's still
something it's an exciting experience
and there's only a you know a few death
states and that in that fight but it's
really about creating a narrative I mean
one of the things I noticed is during
the fight okay so when you're talking to
people you really have the option to be
a total asshole or to just be very
passive or to be very helpful you can go
one of it even in the fight you have an
option to throw them and you can decide
what to throw them against um how does
that affect what how you're building
yourself out as a character yeah i mean
it's it's funny but there's a you know
there's a couch you can throw them into
it and a lot of people are like well I
threw me to the couch because you know
like I wanted to be kind of soft on them
but you know just like they just sort of
you know read into it more than and we
even expect sometimes and that's that's
sort of the fun part of it
and I think in in thats fight
specifically there's it were sort of
just teaching you the mechanics but
later on there's going to be
ramifications for how you treat people
in those types of situations that's
absolutely very very cool i really enjoy
the demo and i'm really excited to see
this when it's available for me to buy
yeah well yeah it'll be available uh
early or late some timber early October
yeah sounds great thank you so much so
thank you we're here with Pierre
charrette lead writer of a wolf among us
at bulk at least episode one anyway
hopefully episode two assuming things go
really really well with this one tell me
about how challenging is it to write for
a character like bigby wolf when the
character are the player gets to make a
lot of the decisions and you just kind
of have to make sure that everything
makes sense regardless of what they do
luckily for us Big B comes from fables
the bill willingham comic book he's a
dynamic enough character that the range
that you have with him the way you'd
want to swing this character emotionally
whether you want to play the role of the
enforcer the law abiding sheriff of
Fabletown or you want to be the guy who
kicks a door in and gets answers all
that still fits in with who big he is
and allowing people to sort of choose
who their big b is it's still possible
even with character that many people
know and love okay so I mean if that if
that's not the big challenge of writing
for a for a game like this then what
what were the things that you were
sitting around the table or discussing
or sitting at your desk tearing your
hair out well figuratively that's what
must be where it all went so um tell me
what was so difficult it was definitely
giving the game and giving the wolf
among us an identity that is different
and sort of sticks out from
what the walking dead is done not trying
to relive the same beats now trying to
have similar characters it's it's own
thing it's it's based on fables it's a
fantastical world and just being true to
that and giving it its own feel an
atmosphere in tone and dialogue was
probably the biggest challenge from a
writing sample thank you so much I
really appreciate you taking the time
Pierre and okay good luck thanks thanks
