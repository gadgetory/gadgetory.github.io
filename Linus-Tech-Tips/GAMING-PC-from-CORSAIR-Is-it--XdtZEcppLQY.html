shaped PC market oh and this is also
Corsairs first time ever building a
complete computer system so have they
done their homework from the looks of
things yes yes they have
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel they're the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description despite this being
Corsairs first ever complete pc they
went straight for the enthusiast and
high-end gaming segment though given
their pedigree that probably shouldn't
come as much of a surprise but what they
have done in what may be a little
surprising is that in my opinion they've
managed to do this without being tacky
about it there's a fine line between
boring business computer and
over-the-top gamer and I feel like the
way that Corsair made functional
elements also look appealing is
something that alludes most PC
industrial design teams even Corsairs
breaking with what has become a standard
operating procedure at forty six to
twenty one landing parkway Fremont they
opted to not include RGB lighting saying
that it doesn't go with the quiet ethos
of the system and as big an RGB fan as I
am personally I do have to say that
they're soft blue lighting scheme which
can be even disabled outright looks very
clean and very modern and it's not just
skin deep overall I've got a commend
Corsair for the top-notch build quality
of the one the sound of running your
fingers along the top of the radiator
looking metal grille is satisfying and
so is running your hands down the
tastefully perforated aluminum side
panels under which you will find a
shocking amount of cooling given the
one's diminutive size the single fan at
the top of the machine draws air through
to water cooling radiators in the one
meaning that the CPU and GPU each get
their own
slim custom 240 millimeter rad ensuring
that you'll get the best possible
performance out of even top-of-the-line
components ours is equipped with a core
i7 7700 K that really seems to love
hitting its full turbo at 4.5 gigahertz
and a GTX 1080 that was able to
overclock well over 2.1 gigahertz more
on performance in a moment the i/o is
pretty typical desktop grade maybe a
little light you'll find a single USB
type-a on the front along with an HDMI
2.0 if VR is your kind of thing then
around back is ps2 for your model M
keyboard enough USBs and everything that
you'd need for a home theater PC use
case as well as a hint
that the video card installation is a
little unusual some additions I would
have liked to see our front panel audio
we don't all have USB headsets Corsair
and Thunderbolt 3 at the back to test
thermals we loaded up I 264 and fir mark
at the same time and the results were
very impressive after an entire hour of
torture testing the GPU reached a mere
57 degrees Celsius with the CPU peaking
at 80 and while I realized 80 degrees
might sound a little hot you have to
remember that was under full synthetic
load on the entire system at max turbo
for a freaking hour
it actually takes quite a while to get
up that high and the great thermals
became even more apparent when compared
to our air-cooled test bench with an
EVGA classified 1080 and a decent if
unexceptional knocked to NHD 9 l cooler
on our equivalent core i7 to get thermal
readings we ran each benchmark seven
times and recorded the maximum GPU and
CPU temps achieved the benchmark results
were almost identical across the board
between these two systems but what
wasn't identical were the temperatures
at factory speeds the CPU on the one was
5 to 10 degrees cooler not that the
games were really stressing it out that
much and the GPU was a chill
20 degrees cooler while maintaining
those temperatures the one also stayed
virtually silent at idle Nick eating
green beans on the other side of the
room was louder than the one sitting
right beside me and under load the one
becomes audible but the pitch of the
fans makes the Machine very easy to tune
out so that it's all great news right
go buy a 1x2 well no ignoring the
overplayed one name in spite of Corsairs
long enthusiast history the one is not
officially user upgradeable and when
talking to corsair about disassembly
they basically said like they
discouraged end-users from doing it to
avoid voiding their warranty and
damaging it and as for us well in short
guys we put a lot of love into the
course everyone please don't break it so
of course we took it apart to find out
just how complicated it was and of
course we did break it but just a little
bit the one is actually very easy to
open removing just two screws on either
side of the top allows you to access the
graphics card or the motherboard and CPU
and reveals a few fun and noteworthy
things the video card uses extension
cables to reach the front and back and
features an extra fan to take care of
vrm cooling while the radiator is
responsible for only the GPU core but
mere 400 watt power supply uses thinner
gauge custom cables in order to minimize
cable clutter and while Corsair did
include an MDOT to slot on the mini ITX
MSI branded motherboard it's actually on
the back of the board and they don't
offer them from the factory so you'll
pretty much be stuck with SATA 3 and odd
move though at least that end Ram are
relatively easy to get at so
line men although literally everything
in the system is possible to upgrade so
a plus Corsair for using standard
components I can only recommend removing
their cooling solution if you don't care
about your warranty and you know what
you are doing there are a lot of subtle
but important bits of engineering that
they put into this to make the product
work as well as it does I mean
thankfully for us the lead product
designer was able to figure out the dumb
stuff we had done and get us back up and
running in a few minutes but since we
can't tell our whole audience to call
Jimmy from Corsair at one triple eight
four two four four six two two our
recommendation for most folks who would
buy a prebuilt is to err on the safe
side and let them or an authorized
service center take care of it for you
but should you buy one how much does it
cost well
ignoring of course that this is a very
high-end build and therefore doesn't
come with a bargain-basement price tag
they've actually done a pretty good job
of keeping the price reasonable building
an identically Specht system on Newegg
came in about two hundred dollars less
than the one but that machine used a
lesser case it obviously doesn't include
assembly service and any warranty issues
will need to be addressed with
individual component manufacturers
leading me then to say this thing is
pretty darn sweet if you're willing to
make the usual expandability compromises
that come with compact gaming rigs and
you want something that is screaming
fast with I'd say pretty reasonable wife
appeal the Corsair one is an outstanding
option and you know what else is a great
option FreshBooks if you're a small
business owner or a freelancer and you
want a cloud accounting software you
might not even know you want to cloud
encounter software okay so if you want
to get more organized be able to send
professional invoices in seconds be able
to accept payment through your
accounting platform be able to take
deposits be able to
see when your clients have looked at
your invoices and just generally be able
to keep your life from turning into a
disorganized shambles you can track your
expenses you can track your hours you
can basically just make it so you can
spend your time doing your work instead
of spend your teen spend reaching spend
your time doing your work instead of
spending your time documenting your work
in complicated software so try it out
