circuit board
it's an Arduino kinda it's a mouse it's
a keyboard and honestly it's a ton of
other stuff too it's a little bit
confused well stay tuned for the
explanation but also open this video in
another tab and don't forget to
subscribe to channel super fun to see
the crew playing Mario counter-strike go
and even a song with this little device
experience silent performance with the
new coolermaster Silencio 652 s
minimalist design maximum compatibility
click now to learn more so while we've
obviously been playing with this thing
for a while as you saw in that other
video the purpose of this video is to
give you a more in-depth view of how
exactly the makey makey allowed us to do
what we're doing and to plant some ideas
in your mind for ways that it might be
able to be used for fun or practical
applications so the boring explanation
of how this little guy works is that it
facilitates the completion of a circuit
through a signal and ground connection
and then sends information based on the
completion of said circuit over a USB to
a computer which will then take that
data as a keyboard or mouse input and
hopefully produce a result but boring
explanations are well boring and the
makey makey is anything but that so what
can you do with this thing well
hopefully you've seen what we've done on
the channel super-fun anyway what
Wow
but that was just barely scratching the
surface of its capabilities and there
will probably be future channel
Superfund videos dedicated to some of
the awesome ideas we have floating
around in the office there are already
loads of videos of people playing music
making vegetables scream when you cut
them which is actually rather disturbing
along with things like water pianos and
interactive dance floors but the point
of this video is to give you the
100-foot view of what this is from a
hardware perspective so let's do a quick
overview of the physical unit on one
side you'll see the more simplistic view
which has alligator clamp holes for the
arrow keys up down left right along with
spacebar and left-click amongst the neat
circuit board design which features some
cool hidden like gaming and music
inspired art below this you have the
earth or ground bar this side can also
be used without any fancy wiring by
simply plugging the board into a
computer over USB you can then hold a
finger to the earth area and tap any
input that you would desire with another
finger to send that over to the computer
and when you do this you'll even see a
little LED light up so that you know
it's working on the other more awesome
side we have access to all the same
alligator connectors that we used to but
now through some jumper wire connectors
we have even more access to ground
connections WASD F and G for keyboard
inputs up down left left click and right
click for Mouse movement and most input
in general which is awesome that's quite
a few inputs to play with and a ton of
fun and this is all we used in our makey
makey video for the channel super fun
but if you choose to follow the White
Rabbit there's an opportunity to go
deeper by installing an Arduino IDE also
known as integrated development
environment and grabbing the makey makey
add-on from Sparkfun
you can program your makey makey
similarly to an Arduino don't worry it's
just some basic text editing you'll be
ok this enables rebinding all of the
inputs of the makey makey which in my
opinion makes it way more usable for
real world applications and by binding
these inputs to something you seldom use
like for myself maybe an F key you can
get your keyboards unused keys to do
cool interesting functions I'm not going
to spoil too many things that I might
use on channel super fun but one thing
that will probably do anyways is a
conductive punching bag
why conduct a punching bag well if
you're getting frustrated with a game
you could bind your f1 key to do an alt
f4 macro and then if you get mad enough
that you want to punch something you can
punch the punching bag and it'll close
the program for you last but not least
there's a jumper wire connector at the
top of these output connectors we're
going to be focusing on D 14 and D 16
because they control output for keyboard
and mouse respectively why would we need
these output options well well you can
do a lot hooked up your computer and
that's pretty cool this thing will make
the makey makey a lot more versatile now
you can be more mobile with your
inventions and creations and you can
have a much more integrated environment
instead of being constantly hooked up to
your computer unless that is your entire
environment in which case feel free to
carry on but if you do decide to take
advantage of these output options you
can do cool little things like hooking
in an additional LED or much bigger
things like home automation that I
mentioned earlier and you can use it to
act as like an event trigger for motors
or other self powered devices in
conclusion this thing is pretty freakin
cool and it seems like every time I even
look at it I think of more awesome ways
that I can put it to use it's relatively
cheap and very easy for anyone to pick
up due to its very wide skill range and
it can be used for a seemingly endless
list of applications and it happens to
be one of those cool opportunities where
it's a toy but it happens to teach you
things like in this case basic
electronics and basic programming while
you play with it in those feature
channel super fun videos is there
anything you guys want to see us try let
us know in the comments down below or
better yet let us know in the forum
speaking of awesome items that can teach
you things today's sponsor is iFixit and
you've probably used or at least read
one of their thousands of in death stare
downs or guides on their website
but what you might not know is that they
have an awesome line of professional
electronics tools the crown jewel in
this lineup is of course their pro tech
tool kit with over 70 tools including a
54 bit driver kit nylon and metal
spudger 's and an anti-static wrist
strap the Pro Tech tool kit is a staple
in our office and whether you're fixing
say a 3ds or a shield or trying to
disassemble an iMac like Linus did in
this video which does require some extra
tools but all of which are available
Fix excites or if you want to improve
your PC building experience with a
better set of tools in general the pro
tect toolkit is a great choice it's
available for only sixty four
ninety-five from iFixit but if you use
our offer code that's linus 0-2
you can save $10 off any purchase of $50
or more so head over to our link that's
ifixit.com slash Linus and save on some
awesome tools today alright guys don't
forget to let me know in the comments
down below or on the forum what kind of
stuff you want to see us do with the
makey makey and if you want to see us do
more kind of like little maker stuff do
you want to see stuff on our dwee node
you want to see stuff on like the flower
board or any other kind of cool maker ii
kind of things I would like to do that
but need to know if what you guys think
so let me know in those two different
locations also down below this video if
you check out the shirt link you can get
a cool shirt which unfortunately isn't
this one I've raised on my shirt that's
awkward also you can like dislike the
video whether or not you're wearing
pants because you can't tell if I am or
not and subscribe if you haven't done
that already over on the forum if you
become a contributor you can get rid of
those ads which aren't there yet but
we'll be there soon and check out other
cool things on the site including the
help Linus media group button which is
in the top right hand corner where you
can do stuff like change your Amazon
links to give us a little kick back
whenever you show up on that site you
guys for watching and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
