2014 I was in the middle of a meeting
the shady character min-liang tan and I
were sitting across from each other on
couches I had recently given the
razorblade 14 2013 edition a mostly
positive review but I was in the middle
of laying in damn about how frustrating
that notebook had been for me because I
thought it was basically perfect if it
wasn't for the TN screen
midway through he kind of started
smiling and then finally he said okay so
lonnis than what you're saying is that
if I fix the screen for you in the next
iteration you'll call it perfect
on-camera not being able to think of
anything else I want to changed
I agreed let's find out if I held up my
end of the bargain is the razor blade
2014 perfect with its power loss
protection affordability and performance
the SP 924 may data makes upgrading to
an SSD remarkably safe and simple so
here is my review of the 2014 blade 14
and apart from my customary complaint
that razor really needs to fix their
bloody product naming scheme I may have
to give this my first-ever Editors
Choice Award it's expensive but it's a
truly remarkable piece of technology on
top of ditching the rubbish panel type
razor quadrupled the pixel count to an
extremely sharp 3200 by 1800 made it a
10-point multi-touch screen and they
improved the core specs of it as well so
we're getting an upgrade to a fourth gen
core i7 4702 HQ quad core with hyper
threading we're getting an upgrade to a
gtx 870 m with three gigs of gddr5
memory which is remarkable given the
form factor that's anywhere from sixty
to a hundred percent faster in real
world games versus the last gen blade 14
and as long as it's running at full
speed which amazingly on a flat surface
it does we're getting 2.5 gigahertz on
the veer and a slightly boosted over
base nine hundred and sixty-seven
megahertz on the GPU in heaven with the
graphics core running
82 degrees of the CPU running at 77
degrees on battery these values dip a
little bit down to around eight hundred
and seventy five megahertz core and two
gigahertz Ram but I guess that's to help
conserve battery life although I still
got a very respectable if not
overwhelming forty-five minutes of
continuous 3d use out of it not bad
considering its size alright so let's
move on to the physical overview the
power brick is incredibly small for a
150 watt just like last time and that's
about it for accessories onto the
machine
it features an aluminum unibody
construction that gives off a definite
Apple would make notebooks like this if
they were cool vibe that also assists
with cooling and keeps it extremely
light and just under four and a half
pounds or about two kilos it's got an
illuminated Razer logo on the back with
subtle sort of accent bumps and
basically it looks just like the last
blade 14 which means it is still
beautiful the bottom has two cooling
intakes and two rubber feet to keep the
notebook from sliding around then moving
to the left side we've got power into
USB 3 ports and a headphone / microphone
combo jack finally on the right is a
Kensington lock in HDMI output and
another USB 3 port which brings us
around to the top the trackpad has a
very pleasing finish and satisfyingly
clicky if a little bit narrow dedicated
left and right buttons the speakers are
unhindered by obstructions and sound
loud even if they're not particularly
deep and booming the power button sits
below the screen above the exhaust that
spits hot air out above the keyboard
here and that keyboard razer has outdone
themselves here the layout is spacious
and nearly perfect every key is
programmable the backlight has an
extravagant 20 levels of illumination
and the keys have a satisfying tactile
click enos that is unlike any other
chiclet type notebook that I have ever
used it is outstanding now I know I
already kind of awarded it an editor's
choice but that doesn't mean I'm not
going to ask for a few things to be
improved in the next revision and number
one is actually related to the next stop
on our tour the screen the resolution
makes it super sharp whenever text
scales correctly and colors and viewing
angles of the screen are much
better than the last check like world's
better but there's still a noticeable
color shift when viewing off-center and
although it makes up for it somewhat
with an incredibly bright backlight and
therefore a very solid contrast ratio
black levels of this screen are not as
deep as I'd like especially for use in a
dimly lit room number two razor the
memory is soldered on and you only gave
us eight gigs that's good enough for
today but what about tomorrow I
regularly use six gigs of RAM on my
desktop just browsing the web the 256
gigs skew and up need to have 16 gigs of
RAM for this machine to last long enough
to justify the sticker price especially
if it's not going to be upgradable and
number three well I think we got just
enough USB 3 ports and while I
appreciate the upgrade to Intel solid
7260 AC wireless solution I don't think
a gaming machine is complete without an
Ethernet port even if it requires an
adapter or something and then while
we're at it I would have much rather
seen mini DisplayPort in the place of
HDMI out due to its higher resolution
support and ability to be inexpensively
adapted to anything else but that's it
that's all I got it's an engineering
marvel
I mean out of my measly four complaints
one of them could have been resolved
with a $25 USB Ethernet adapter a
trivial amount of money for anyone
buying a blade 14 which I guess leads
into one more like extra bonus criticism
one that's very different from the
others and that I don't expect Razer to
be able to fix it anytime soon the blade
14 is very very expensive I don't have
to like it but I do understand it and
that's the reason why I'm not taking its
editors choice award away for costing as
much as my car for a 512 gig model for
the same price you can of course get a
much more powerful gaming desktop or
even a much more powerful gaming
notebook but this is a luxury item that
a lot of R&amp;amp;D went into so someone has to
pay those engineers and that's why it
costs as much sadly it's too expensive
for my tastes but for affluent gamers
who want something beautifully crafted
that they can take on the road with them
this notebook will absolutely annihilate
similarly crafted machines like Apple's
13-inch MacBook
so here's the conclusion with network
streaming gaming technology advancing so
quickly right now
how long lived thin and light gaming
notebooks will be as a category remains
to be seen but one thing's for sure in
my mind right now it's alive and this
one rules the roost if you can afford
one I wholeheartedly recommend the blade
14 2014 nothing is perfect so I'm
reneging on that deal where I have to
call it perfect but I will say it's the
first notebook I've ever seen that just
plain doesn't feel like a compromise in
any way it's been light beautiful and
powerful and it's my new favorite well
done Razer thank you guys very much for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment under the video letting me know
what you think of the Razer Blade 2014
if you think that Razer should really
let me keep this instead of making me
send it back which is making me very
very sad right now as I try to finish
this review anyway in the video
description you can check out the
support link guys where you can buy cool
t-shirts like this to maybe help me
afford a razor blade 2014 you can also
