little earlier for me than everyone else
because they're all still sleeping and I
need to get internet going at the new
place ASAP so I built myself a router
and then because our fiber box uses SFP
I have to build myself a router so
that's the one you machine back there
that is capable of taking that in so
that we can get internet going so that
people can work on all the inventory
stuff that they need to do on Google
Docs over there also just to make sure
that our that our internet is working so
off we go
Corsair delivers real mac or Nothing
with genuine German made cherry MX key
switch is on there strafe keyboards
click on this spot right here to learn
more all right so we got another load
here that's on impact as best they could
without bins here's what I've been
working on all morning
EPS hence box and I tried to throw
together last night
that's not basically wouldn't detect any
network interfaces which is like
SuperDuper awesome so I've been trying
to get hooked up to our ball and fiber
internet and I'm done I'm done Luke
showed up with a switch for me and that
is the new solution we're working on
inventory
so Brandon John and Justin yeah it's
sorting things according to you know
here's all the sick new stuff for the
editing workstations
everyone's getting these SteelSeries
desk pads everyone's getting like
freaking people are gonna have to fight
over the MX masters cuz we only got two
of them and I think we requested like
nope nope nope like half a dozen of them
so that'll be like a channel super-fun
prize or something for winning some kind
of a challenge the pile has gotten just
beyond all reason this is the to be put
into inventory pile for us to sort
through for the upcoming garage sale as
well as to just figure out what on earth
we have this is cool so here's a bit of
an update on Brandon's c-stand folder
this is what it looks like full of C
stands pretty freakin cool
plumbers are here today so we have like
a sink which is good that's an
improvement over no sink they're also
doing the ceiling tiles you can
they're doing all the tough stuff first
since a while we have like exit signs
more progress on this bathroom so
plumbers not in for fixtures yet but
they've actually cut this hole today so
what we're hoping is that we will be
moved in in like three days
so that's for the other office for an
update I'm sweaty
yeah I'm chef it's also hungry yes cuz
like I woke up at like 9:25 today so I'm
in here editing and everyone else is
moving because we have to release videos
still so I have to edit though I came
back and there's this stuff all over one
which is great because that's actually
exactly what we need let's go on a tour
of all the things that we still have to
do so this room still has a bunch of
stuff that he's come out of it but it's
looking pretty good because they just
got all the shelves out all this dough
needs to go luckily a lot of its in
boxes I'm assuming that was Ed Phil's
work which is great the kitchen hasn't
really had much done to it so softbox
late oh my goodness ok it's 2 p.m. we
have to be out of here today here's my
ghetto networking job that is moderately
online at the moment all this stuff
doesn't gone yet obviously the server's
still need to go all the tearing stuff
but that kind of has to stay up for now
I still editing the videos he's still
working and the servers down on all of
this and then my office which that's
just a pile of my stuff there's some
boxes and that's all packing material so
who cares but yeah probably more than 4
hours of work that's all we have left
now it was working when I left and then
someone may or may not have stepped on
something the keyboard was stepped on
and now knew the server isn't responding
the reason why we left the server here
and my computer is because we know that
they've worked because we didn't mess
with them but like this is a problem it
stopped working as soon as you left
mm-hmm
we've had some problems Oh God arrayed
yeah like it does this and then it'll
little like go back down again oh you're
gone I tried to transfer the files and
now the drive is like corrupted did you
just fix the server last I think so so
it had to do with the network teaming
configuration sort of I think gotta go
through some of these critical and fatal
errors and figure out what's going on
but hopefully
wanax server is in good shape because we
are literally like hours as opposed to
days away from having everything set up
so that everything on it is replicated
so it'd be a really terrible time to
lose a bunch of data from the server oh
god
this is actually you know what I'm glad
you turn the camera on because this is
kind of an exciting moment the death a
whole room water cooling though it's
shut down for good
your switch them on okay you're not
rendering right now no I'm not I don't
work my pump is powerful remember well
because this all that gum connects no no
I I cleaned it again well you don't need
it again again in theory it should be
fine have you ever wondered what a
toilet that hasn't been opened in over
two years

the key turn your water off right yeah
