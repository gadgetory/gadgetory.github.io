i have boxes actually i have a system
hiding behind the boxes featuring a
number of the components that are here
represented by the boxes that the
components are no longer inside because
they are in the system so we have the
crosshair 5 formula which is a Seuss's
republic of gamers SLI crossfire already
motherboard that has a full support for
AMD bulldozer FX so we've got an fx-8150
cpu and here cooled by the corsair h 100
using for fans and push-pull
configuration for maximum static
pressure and maximum airflow we've also
got a Radeon HD 6970 direct see you too
from Asus so the direct see YouTube
cooler uses dual fans in order to
provide better cooling than the
reference design card you can actually
run not only one but two of those cards
in this system just by adding an
additional card and upgrading the power
supply where the AXA 50 is more than
enough for a single card solution just
for comfort you might want to go with
something a little bit higher end if you
go with a dual or even a triple no I
don't think yeah this card does not
support triple graphics because it uses
a triple slot cooler on this particular
motherboard but you can still go with
dual graphics and then you might want to
go with an HX 7 but is HX 1050 these
days I think the HX 1000 gone either way
let's have a look at the system so the
first thing you're going to see here is
the AMD FX 8350 in order to the maximum
amount of stress on the CPU to make sure
it's stable before we start any
overclocking because these systems will
come pre overclocked this is actually
going to be a special edition red
painted system as you may or may not be
able to tell at this point in time I
also want to show you one other cool
thing about the bulldozer FX CPU I'm
going to stop the small FFT test
hopefully that doesn't bother crazy
Russians it's not
doing anything that matters I don't know
so I'm going to set it to one torture
test thread to run and you are going to
see AMD turbo hold on
there we go so cor clocks are up to 3.9
gigahertz so that is using their turbo
core technology in order to provide
better single-threaded performance when
you're running a lightly threaded
workload so there you go it works ah
what else do we have here yeah let's
open it up and have a look at the rest
of the system config I actually don't
know how much these are going to cost
yet I don't know what the final clock
speeds of the CPU are going to be yet
these are all sort of trivial details
what you need to know is that it is a
beast machine and it looks great so
we've got the ax 850 there there's your
triple slot capable of five simultaneous
outputs a juice Radeon 69 70 and you can
put an additional one in this slot right
here actually ooh can you can you okay
apparently you can I'm getting the nod
from crazy Russians and that's good
we've also got a crucial M 4 SATA 3 SSD
installed in the top bay and a three
terabyte storage drive that's a 128 gig
right yep I'm getting the nod we've got
8 gigs of Corsair Vengeance Ram which
can be upgraded to 16 gigs should you so
desire we've got the H 100 so you can
clearly see the 2 stock Corsair fans
here and then we've also got 2
Coolermaster red LED fans here which
gives you that little bit of LED
lighting accent on the top we've got the
coarse RH 100 right here which you can
actually adjust the fan speed on just by
clicking the button so there's your low
mid and your high speed settings just
you can see the LED illumination around
it and the crosshair 5 formula
motherboard makes a beautiful backdrop
with its black overall look and red
accents that go along with every other
aspect of this system very very sharp
looking system so thank you oh yeah
we've got hey check that out we've got a
blu-ray of this out a blu-ray burner
nope we've got a blu-ray player DVD
burner combo unit in the front to go
with the a seuss and Corsair overall
theme of this build it is an asus
blu-ray drive and i think that pretty
much covers everything I wanted to
say about this guy I look forward to
getting back to you guys with our
overclocking results with the bulldozer
fx-8150 don't forget to subscribe to
