wait for the show Florida open we're
here at number 69
leeta street I think that's how you
pronounce it which happens to be MSI's
headquarters here in Taiwan and we're
checking out a couple of msis all new
laptop designs starting with the GE 65
Raider so from the outside this looks
like a fairly normal laptop you got to
power in you got your SD you got a
couple of super speed USB s these are
actually pretty cool they light up so
you can find them in the dark there
there you go then on the other side
we've got another one of those mini
DisplayPort HDMI 2.0 Gigabit Ethernet
oh that's just Type C no Thunderbolt
headphone and microphone jacks but
that's exactly what's special about the
GE 65 Raider is that it looks like a
perfectly total normal 15.6 inch laptop
but under the hood it's got a shocking
amount of horsepower so we're talking up
to an 8 core core i9 Intel processor up
to an r/t X 2070 max P is apparently
what we're calling ones that are not max
Q so that's a full power design up to 32
gigs of ram up to 2 nvme raid 0 boot
drives in here and of course a wack ton
of cooling see that Apple when you've
got a bunch of like really high-powered
hardware inside your chassis you need
room for it to breathe and not only that
but you need like a literal like
kilogram of copper inside in order to
pull the heat away now I don't know that
it's actually a kilogram I'm just going
based on how have you this thing feels
now it's not gonna have a ton of battery
life because it's only got like a 53
watt hour battery or something like that
but if you want this kind of performance
in a form factor that's actually total
this is looking pretty sweet it features
a 240 hertz IPS display along with of
course the hardware to actually drive
240 frames per second as well as a
subjectively pretty nice feeling
touchpad even if I'm not a huge
fan of the keyboard one nice thing I
will say about the keyboard though is
that in spite of the 15.6 inch screen
size
you've got slim bezels and a number pad
along with a webcam so I hope a soos is
taking notes on that particular feature
and on the subject of not a lot of
battery life this is the upcoming GT 76
Titan so we were blown away when
Alienware announced their area 51 M a
laptop with a desktop 9900 k-8 Core
processor in it well MSI is trying to do
them one better with not only a desktop
9900 K along with an RT X xx 80 max
performance skew graphics card in here
but they are guaranteeing I have cliff
from MSI's personal guarantee that every
one of those 9900 case is going to be
capable of 5 gigahertz all core
overclocking out-of-the-box can you even
believe how do you even do that in a
laptop well tell you how by having 11
heat pipes with the entire bottom of the
machine basically a massive mesh with
four cooling fans and Counting my
friends 1 2 3 4 5
cooling radiators all over the back of
the freaking unit it's got a 144 Hertz
1080p or 60 Hertz 4k panel the same
keyboard and touchpad combination that
we saw on the radar just now pretty
decent looking yo but really like none
of that is the point 5 gigahertz 8
course all core turbo with an r/t X 20
80 Wow
