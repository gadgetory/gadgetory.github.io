overcome cost and both the headset
itself and the PC required to run it our
factors here the fact that you look like
a complete doof while your flouncing
about in the middle of your living room
is another one and for that matter here
we are in the VR space here at Linus
Media Group you need a fair bit of space
in order to even use it but I think more
people could overlook these restrictions
if it wasn't for the clunky headsets and
the bulky surprisingly heavy easy to
tangle and movement restricting tethers
that tie them to their PC well as most
of you know I'm not an engineer so
there's nothing I can really do about
the headset itself but after a
particularly vigorous round of hollow
point the other day I was inspired to
see if I could do something about the
cable and once again our friends at
Corning have come through so today I
will be trying at least trying anyway to
replace the entire bulky tether with
this durable thin and light optical
cable
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description so first things first
I got to gather up all the supplies I
need for what I'm calling project light
VR cable get it because it's optical and
it's not as heavy so it starts with that
Corning optical cable that I mentioned
before next we're going to need a gaming
computer with support for Thunderbolt
so while I know the g7 51 from Asus with
its 980m graphics card is not
technically VR ready this is a
proof-of-concept not my daily driver rig
so this will do just nicely however
because the HTC vive and the oculus rift
for that matter do not have thunderbolt
inputs we're actually going to need to
split out our Thunderbolt cable into all
the necessary connectors on the other
end so for that I'll be using the
called--it ts2 or really I could use
pretty much any Thunderbolt dock but
what this baby is going to do is give us
2 USB 3 SuperSpeed ports HDMI and audio
exactly what we need
also I guess there's another USB port
there where is my power adapter for this
thing nothing's ever simple it's always
a journey to gain Mount Doom when we
want to make a video let's find a 5 amp
12 volt DC part I thought the power
adapter might be here where I used to
have that thing set up running to the
server room it's not but I did discover
that I already had one of these optical
cables so Corning sent me an extra when
I guess forgot to meet that what 5 volt
4 amp
see I'm pretty sure it's like
straight-up non-compliant to not have
the voltage of an input listed okay I
found this k-tec
12 volt 3 amp thing that fits which I'm
hoping is enough because this would be
over SPECT to allow for a bunch of
devices to be plugged into all the USB
ports and everything but speaking of
power if we're not going to power the
vive through the original tether one of
those wires is up is a power cord and
we're not going to power it through the
Thunderbolt cable which were not because
optical cables do not carry power we're
going to have to do something which
leads us to the last ingredients of our
setup a small backpack this was the
smallest one we had lying around the
office and I'm not buying a backpack for
this and for some reason I thought I
needed to so two battery banks one of
which actually has an AC power outlet
okay so I lied that wasn't everything we
needed but I found the things we need a
short USB 3 a 2 a cable a short HDMI
cable and this is fun I remembered what
the second power bank is for so that
one's to hopefully go DC to DC to power
the vibe itself because it's got a
12-volt something amps we're not quite
sure
max power input however both of our
battery banks are dead so we're going to
charge these up for the night and we'll
get back at this tomorrow so we're back
now when I originally conceived this
project I actually thought I was gonna
have to cut off the tether and then
resolder all the individual wires and
like figure out which ones were carrying
which signals and whatever and all that
but you know silly me I had no idea that
the HTC vive I mean you can see why it
took me a little while to sort this out
the HTC vive actually just has all the
inputs
as plugs up at the top there we go just
like that so two USBs one of which I
think has functionality TBD HDMI power
and three-and-a-half millimeter so
theoretically it's as simple as going
from here oh wow okay
theoretically we've already hit one
stumbling block this doesn't physically
fit so theoretically it's as simple as
going from here into our Thunderbolt hub
wow that is not a very long cable so
we've got another challenge as well
between all the different adapters that
come with our ravpower extreme series
power bank only one of them is even kind
of close to fitting so we would either
have to cut off and REE splice a
compatible adapter or we'll have to rely
on using the AC outlet one and the power
squid or a power brick in order to power
both the vive as well as the Cal digit
box meaning that our battery life will
be somewhat more limited three and a
half millimeter audio cable should fit
though at least a right angle connector
nope even plugging my headphones in
directly isn't going to work okay so
it's back to the drawing board somewhat
here hopefully this is one of those
things where it gets messy ER before it
gets better
let's go see if we can find a low
profile HDMI cable oh never cut towards
your fingers well I'll give monoprice
this their HDMI cables are tough
obviously I tried to find a lower
profile connector one first but failing
that I well took the one we had and
threw it in the vise about
in minutes of hacking away at it later
and it's uglier but it fits Wow that is
a tight fit you might be back in action
here it was at that point that I
realized we didn't have thunderbolt
drivers be updated Nvidia drivers or the
software for the HTC vive installed so
we took a short break while I got all
the software up to date so we have a
small problem if I'm plugged into the
HDMI connection on the Cal digit box for
getting me a composite or not available
error in steamvr but if I plug directly
into the HDMI out on the computer we're
good now there is still hope it's
possible that we can use the Thunderbolt
daisy-chain port here to run HDMI /
DisplayPort into either directly into
the headset or into the splitter box
that's included with the vibe but I'm
really not sure if that's going to work
so stay tuned so we're going to try this
again going from Thunderbolt to DVI to
HDMI ok I'll try again so just as a
troubleshooting step I'm going to go
back to the HDMI output right off the
computer
and into this box so let's make sure
that it works if we do that so I've
reached a very challenging point in the
troubleshooting I have just tried to
connect it the vanilla recommended way
with the normal tether and running
through the connector box and it's still
not working
but get this when I take a stand-alone
HDMI cable and plug that directly into
the computer now whatever take my word
for it the headset comes up and it
starts working so I'm starting to think
this might be a combination of issues
where the Thunderbolt implementation
yeah there see there it is ready where
the Thunderbolt implementation of this
laptop might use the onboard graphics
that is a very very likely situation and
my box might be dead but as long as
there is any potential for a problem to
be solved by simply throwing more
hardware at it I'm still in the game so
I went home I got a mini DisplayPort to
HDMI I knew I had one of these turns out
that's where it was I got a different
Thunderbolt to dock I got the connector
hub from my own vibe and just for good
measure
I brought my personal rig back to the
office because this one I know for sure
because there's a physical damn cable
going from my GTX Titan X to the
Thunderbolt card this one runs off of
the dedicated graphics let's go I
suddenly remember why oh we moved to
aluminum so it's update time the box
isn't dead and the vibe is running
perfectly off of my machine now let's
try going back to thunderbolt no okay
wait a minute oh my god I don't have the
Thunderbolt see I'm flustered now okay
what's this interesting it says ready
let's restart in direct mode Wow
wouldn't it be amazing if it was that
simple I don't see anything though bob
was very abrupt yep we didn't know when
we were shooting this video it was going
to be a two-parter so Texico it is so
it's summer where you board planes
trains and maybe even taken a car
somewhere to leave your worries behind
and today's lack of online privacy
brings out your inner grizzly bear wow
these are new notes they're very funny
if that happens then you should try

VPN app that makes it easy to browse
privately and enjoy a more open Internet

just gonna give it the OL reboot just in
case hey whoa
can you see what I see I think we're in
