brought to you by mass drop while I may
not wear a fitness wearable we all know
I'm not trendy anyway so that doesn't
prevent Fitness from being our first
trend here at CES 2016 the Fitbit blaze
watch improves on their previous fitness
watch the surge in a few ways it's got a
color display their fit star program
with three built-in workouts and
animations showing you how to do them
it's compatible with over 200 mobile
devices and the battery will last for
five days of actual use the sensoria
athlete 2000 is a prototype workout suit
that uses sensors to track body
temperature fatigue balance impact force
running cadence and more the whole suit
is just a prototype but you can get a
bundle that includes a top for men or
sports bra for women a chest sensor and
an anklet sensor called the fitness
running system for $400 the Under Armour
Gemini 2 with speedform is a distance
tracking shoe it's not GPS based instead
using accelerometers for accurate motion
tracking and Under Armour says this is
more accurate than wearing something on
your wrist
since the sensor is actually on your
foot it transmits data via bluetooth can
can actually store data without a
smartphone for five workouts out of time
and push to it later on the shoes are a
hundred and thirty dollars trend number
two is smart home products and
automation the lyric water freeze and
warning detector from Honeywell can be
put anywhere where there could be a leak
or a pipe freeze on a table under the
pipes of your house and will warn you
with a push notification and email if
the temperature drops below a certain
threshold the Samsung family huh but
smart fridge is actually more than just
a tablet stuck to a fridge it's got a
huge 21 and a half inch touchscreen and
lets you do all kinds of food-related
things you can order groceries you can
look up recipes and it's got cameras
inside so you can see what food you have
while you're out at the store so you
don't end up buying duplicates the soma
bar robotic bartender is kind of like a
Keurig for alcohol it's got three clear
compartments that hold alcohol and
mixers with for a total of seven hundred
and fifty
Mills you tell the machine through the
app what's in the compartments and it's
got three hundred recipes built in or
you can create your own you can even add
bitters and the machine will flush
itself out between uses
so things will taste right it comes in
at a pricey four hundred and twenty nine
dollars but that's certainly a lot
cheaper than even a few nights out at
the bar with friends so it might be a
justifiable purchase it'll be available
sometime in quarter two trend number
three is display technology and this
one's kind of a broad one but there's a
lot going on and Panasonic is showing
off transparent displays that look like
part of a living room curio slash
display cabinet so it's essentially a
window and a display in one you can also
use it as both for example if you just
want it to display weather info or
sports scores in one spot and be able to
see through the rest of it speaking of
seeing through the rest of it BMW was
showing off a concept motorbike helmet
with an augmented reality heads-up
display that sits right in front of the
rider so as not to distract him or her
and Panasonic LG and Samsung are all
starting to incorporate HDR or high
dynamic range technology into their
higher-end TVs now this doesn't look
like it's just a gimmick like the bad
HDR capturing some smartphones and there
is even an industry-wide certification
process in order to be certified
what HDR means is they can reproduce
more colors and more accurate colors
than most other displays which leads us
to Oh LEDs no longer being only present
in smart phones and televisions no my
friend's Dells got a desktop monitor and
lenovo has a notebook both of which
feature OLED displays that hopefully
address the issue with OLED Xand burn in
on static images something that can be
an issue with things like the taskbar
tech trend number four is drones where
we're starting to see drones capable of
doing more than just kind of awkwardly
flying around and recording video the e
hang 184 can actually carry a freaking
person as long as they're brave enough
to get into it the pair
Disko ditches the traditional quadcopter
look and instead has wings like an
airplane did I mention it's capable of
going 50 miles per hour and the unique
typhoon H has an intel realsense camera
built-in so it can avoid colliding with
objects without any user input which
brings us to our final trend car
technology cars without mirrors BMW did
this with their i8 Concept which was a
huge hit at CES it uses several
extremely low latency cameras and a high
resolution screen instead of a rear view
mirror with winged quote-unquote mirrors
with cameras on them to give you a
real-time look behind and to the sides
of the car with much better viewing
angles than traditional mirrors and even
glancing over your shoulder Google also
looks like they're gonna have some
competition in the autonomous car market
with Ford showing off a self-driving
focus that they hope to price low enough
to be accessible to the masses Nvidia
also showed off its Nvidia Drive px 2 an
updated version of the original drive
released last year it's the computer
that could control your first
self-driving car it's as powerful as 150
MacBook Pros or 6 Titan X's and it's
even liquid cooled it also uses cloud
based deep machine learning to improve
Volvo has already adopted the technology
