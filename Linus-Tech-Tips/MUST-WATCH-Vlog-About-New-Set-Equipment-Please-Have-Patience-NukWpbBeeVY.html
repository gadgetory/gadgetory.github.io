my way to work and I saw someone comment
on one of my recent videos I'm on the
new SAT right now which is I'm pointing
around at it so they said hate the new
format I'm subscribing so for those of
you who sort of feel that way I would
implore you to sort of wait a little bit
longer so far we've only tried using the
new equipment a few times we're making
constant weeks I know we've released two
videos that sort of didn't seem to
account for any of the feedback from
viewers but understand that we film more
than one video at a time and so for me
to make any changes actually takes a
little while before they can go through
the the uploading process I mean
something to bear in mind guys is when
I'm not cheating though Henry zetia at
the editing pc is that we have up to
check this out like 30 videos at a time
that are pending release when we're
actually filming so guys it's going to
take a little while nothing is set in
stone so don't don't give up based on
you don't like the format or you don't
like the products bear in mind to guys
when we're trying a new format we're
much more likely to use a product that
is not necessarily critical you know
something like say for example a camera
holder when we want to experiment with
something rather than sort of betting
everything and going with our you know
new video card video or CPU or case or
whatever else without making sure that
we've got everything right so treat this
as a time of experimentation don't
unsubscribe because I released one video
that you don't like I think that's
pretty much it so and the other thing is
keep giving feedback because even though
I'm not able to respond to everything I
am reading all of the comments on the
new format videos i'm reading all the
tweets about it so yeah I'm listening
even if you can't tell yet and we are
going to make the changes we are going
to find a balance that's some
we're in the middle we are going to
experiment with different things in
terms of the you know the cameras and
the lights and the background and
whatever else I mean we might not end up
in my living room might end up somewhere
else completely so bear with me let me
know how you feel about it and well
we'll make this work somehow don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips I
suppose for more unboxings reviews
