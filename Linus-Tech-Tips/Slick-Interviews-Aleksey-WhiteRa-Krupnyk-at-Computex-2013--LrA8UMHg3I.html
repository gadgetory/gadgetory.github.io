thermaltake booth with white raw many of
you guys might notice if you follow
starcraft 2 i'm just wondering what got
into what what was your inspiration for
creating mice and stuff with thermaltake
you know I have huge experience in
premium science 99 and my goal it's
helped new players and to make eSports
more bigger so of course I use my
experience and searching for with cheeky
sport we work more than two years and
together starting to make good products
for gamers new generational at the same
time all people can use it for example
this products help me play better in my
32 years the a special doctor for all
times ok so I heard something earlier
that the mouse and everything that you
use is actually specially made for you a
lot of a lot of brands will make things
after after pro players and after
whoever but they're just kind of general
mice I've heard this one it's actually
made for you is that true yes it's so
close to me but these products can use
everyone in the air not only in LTS
games like shooters because for example
which I take out about our community
gamers community so I think it's very
great idea it's very cool to see that it
was actually made for you so you'll be
enjoying it the entire time and then
people with like hands like yours play
styles like yours will enjoy using as
well yeah so you can use people with
small hand middle can be cramped and
choice so let's say different dating
solution like split the solution yeah
well a lot of stuff if it's such an to
talk about technical moment since take
11 hours I think yeah yeah ok now some
more starcraft ii based questions that i
want to get you so he said 1999 correct
yeah what what kind of got you really
into starcraft and what is your favorite
moment through your entire career in
starcraft my favorite moment
it's when they meet with slayer boxer

play like a take part in a small
tournaments in little pc room this is
some video from Korea varies already

change anything like six month before
commence fabulous lamina huge eater has
very new ability and I hope see in
future some new new patches it's what my
favorite part about it is how they open
it up to a lot more players bringing
like the achievement system and the
leveling up systems efficiency in for
example in class yours more information
for people who don't know what happened
if you lose connection with internet or
something happen with computer you can
from the place back in this moment it's
so amazing because you have so many
conflict situation in 29 it went to core
power or something's happenin referee
cell play a game or give loose or VN
players but now you just back in the
moment before we lose connections and
continue play this help like see who's
who in do one thing that I really like
this just a little shout out for my
brother my brother cold se is a caster
from Canada and he's done a few events
one big thing is they'll lose internet
connection at a land
you lose internet connection somewhat a
lag out and now you don't have to
completely restart the match like you
were just saying so nice be able to pick
up from wherever you want and some of
the games that they did right when heart
of the swarm was released when they did
like you can pick up from where you
thought you started losing that is a
very very cool dynamic that people
