take a look at for a while this is the
ZOTAC GeForce GTX 480 and edition so
it's a GTX 480 but it includes an
aftermarket cooler and ZOTAC was
actually one of if not the first to
market with an aftermarket cooled GTX
480 something that it really benefits
from because it'll run quite a bit
cooler quite a bit quieter so we'll go
around have a look at the back it's the
same usual marketing stuff on the back
of the box you know what this one's
going to be all about having a look at
the part itself so let's get this baby
opened up and see what ZOTAC includes
with the GTX 480 amp Edition first of
all this is quite an attractive looking
card it has a dual turbine vga cooler
which basically looks like 292
millimeter fans you can see part of the
fan is actually covered by the shroud a
little bit there it's got kind of a neat
graphic on the front of it the one thing
you'll notice right away about this
cooler is that it is triple slot so you
see the backplate is dual slot you've
got one more slot worth of cooler here
and that's something that you will have
to sacrifice in order to use the amp
Edition card other than that it is a
stock reference GTX 480 so you can see
right here they haven't changed the PCB
to account for the different cooler
stereo I'll show you a stock stock
cooled ZOTAC GTX 480 over here so you
can see the back of the card will look
identical okay but it's all about the
changes that they've made to the cooler
so I wouldn't expect any better
overclocking results on the amp Edition
because of it being cherry-picked or
anything like that but I would
definitely expect better overclocking
results due to the additional GPU
cooling so you can see that we've got
I'm actually just gonna cheat a little
bit and count them here one two three
four five he pipes coming off of the GPU
contact area so one of them comes up
this way the next one goes up that way
and runs all the way to the end so three
of the heat pipes run down to the end
over here and then two of them run down
to these ends one
here one here one disadvantage of the
amp series cooler is that it does not
exhaust the heat out of the case like
the stock cooler does so you can see
here all of that heat is being exhausted
by the fan out the back of the case but
that is not the case with the amp so you
will have to make sure you have a well
ventilated case but I mean if you're
buying a almost $600 graphics card you
should probably get a decent case to go
along with it one thing I really like
about the amp is you can see they've got
a custom feed up custom heat sink under
the amp cooler for the GPU so that's
going to take care of all of your room
all of your VRMs all of that good stuff
and compared to the aftermarket solution
that I'll be comparing the amp to it's
quite a bit more elegant so I just
wanted to show it very briefly next to
the gelid solutions i see visions so i'm
just gonna move the blocks away ah in
terms of accessories you got a couple of
molex to PCIe a dual piece guy you get
six pin to eight pin you got a mini HDMI
to HDMI DVI to VGA you got some
documentation and let's get back to the
card because that is what it's all about
for this particular video so here's the
IC vision here's the amp and here is a
stock coolant card okay so all of them
look pretty similar both the amp and the
IC vision I'm gonna look at them from
the side but both of these are going to
be three slot coolers so you're not
going to be able to make use of the slot
next to the card nor the next one but a
lot of SLI compatible motherboards
that's not going to be a problem as long
as you don't intend to install any other
cards besides your graphics cards they
both include 92 millimeter fans dual
ones the IC vision you can see has a
similar number of heat pipes it's got
five heat pipes but they are arranged a
little bit differently and it also has
not as elegant a solution for cooling
all the other parts of the card so you
can see you got to kind of stack up a
bunch of different heat sinks on the
VRMs you got these little whiskey memory
heat sinks down here now it's probably
going to be perfectly adequate I
wouldn't worry about the card being
damaged
anyway but I do like this solution
better where you've got one nice big
unis Inc style thing and it's cooling
all the different parts of the card you
could snice and beefy there so just like
the normal GTX 480 it uses one eight pin
in one six pin connector and other than
that I guess there's not really a whole
lot to say thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the zotac amp Edition GTX
480 and hopefully I'll have a
temperature comparison up for you in the
next little bit here actually one thing
I forgot to include about the amp
Edition card is a quick cost comparison
so you can see that the regular ZOTAC
GTX 480 is 519 after rebate so that's
actually five $49.99 before rebate and
then the amp Edition card is actually
only another $30 before rebate and then
only another $60 after rebate whereas if
you grab an IC oh shoot I lost my search
result whereas if you buy a regular 480
with an IC vision you're actually
looking at about the same price except
that you have to do the work of
installing the aftermarket cooler so if
you are buying a GTX 480 and you do
intend to install a big three slot
aftermarket cooler on it I see no reason
not to go with an amp Edition because it
does come with a lifetime warranty and
it saves you the trouble of installing
that cooler on it it also means that the
warranty will cover you for the
aftermarket cooling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
