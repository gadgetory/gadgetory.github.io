you by D brand skins for phones laptops
etc visit D brand comm slash Lynas CES
so we're here in the entire restaurant
that lenovo has rented out checking out
their new brand now this here the lenovo
legion y 720 is hardly the first gaming
notebook we've ever seen from lenovo
they've had ones in the past they were
usually why something and someone
internally must have gone why don't we
have a gaming specific brand and they
created one so it's going to be legion
and this is one of the first products
that will bear the legion badge and the
legion logo it's got a brushed aluminum
backing that looks kind of like a woven
basket carbon fiber with their Legion
logo that I personally think looks
pretty sleek it's got an RGB backlit
keyboard that's got four different zones
but given the price point which we'll
get to later that kind of makes sense
that they don't have the individually
backlit keys because it does have some
other very interesting features as well
this is the first laptop that I'm aware
of with Dolby Atmos support which is
pretty freakin cool and it's also one of
the first pre-built systems that I've
seen that has integrated support for a
Microsoft Xbox one wireless controller
up to four players without needing a
dongle IO is a pretty solid mix hdmi 2.0
couple USB threes mini DisplayPort
Thunderbolt three thumbs up for that and
over here on the other side we've got
their proprietary power Gigabit Ethernet
USB 3 and a combo headphone microphone
jack now whoops I almost dropped it but
that's okay
and let's open her up and have a look at
what they've done to the inside of this
bad boy come on baby now to be clear
this is a pre-release model
so I don't want you guys judging it too
closely but there are a few things that
stood out to me and here already so 15.6
inch chassis how did they squeeze
everything in here number one is they've
got the batteries actually broken up
into two separate modules here something
that I actually have only rarely
encountered before CPU and GPU are taken
care of by four the CPU just the
left-hand side if you were actually
using it fan and relatively thick
heatsink thin array here and the GPU has
a dedicated one over on the right and
thanks to this long heat pipe that goes
between the whole thing is going to get
some help from the left as well so
that's a ten sixty with six gigs of RAM
as far as I know the hard drive it's got
its own little spot over here there's
MDOT to storage and this is cool
under the MDOT two that's where the
Microsoft wireless module is right there
the last thing that was kind of an
interesting one to me is the fact that
the memory so we've got two swappable
sodium slots ddr4 dual channel memory is
covered by a little shielding cover
which I'm not 100% sure why that's there
but I'm sure someone smarter than me
will let me know in the comments below
so the price they're targeting for this
thing is starting at around $1,200 with
the core i7 processors a7 700 HQ GTX
1060 and then your storage and RAM may
vary so let us know what you think down
below and thank you for checking out
this video on the y 520 from luna excuse
me
Legion by Lenovo also big thanks to D
brand for sponsoring our coverage here
at CES 2017 D brand is the place to go
if you need a wicked awesome marbled
skin for your iPhone or you need a
wicked awesome actually they don't carry
this color anymore because it's tacky
and gaudy and who could possibly want it
but because they do laptops game
controllers game consoles mobile devices
and they are offering $1.00 worldwide
shipping for a limited time so check it
out at the link below that's d brand
