unboxing is going to be extremely
high-tech yes we have two cameras and
one of them isn't on a tripod see slick
give it a little give it a little dance
yeah thanks okay that's enough so slick
is gonna be on the one camera with
diesel on the other camera and we are
gonna be unboxing the Kraken x40 from
NZXT this is the world's first
all-in-one 140 millimeter liquid cooler
and that gives it a huge surface area
advantage over its competition which is
generally using 120 millimeters or some
derivative thereof such as dual 120
millimeters now there's an X 60 as well
but this version right here is the one
that's gonna fit in the widest variety
of cases because let me tell you guys a
dual 140 millimeter radiator is not
going to fit into many cases however
when it does once again due to the huge
surface area advantage it has over a
dual 120 we are gonna see some serious
performance improvements now I've been
saying for a long time basically since
they showed up that these all-in-one
liquid coolers are limited not by the
pump not by the water block design but
by the surface area of the radiator so
something like a course RH 100 addressed
that in a big way compared to its
predecessors but this should be the next
evolutionary step forward so in terms of
packaging we've got an environmentally
friendly cardboard package here we have
a simple instruction manual with a disc
that you may actually want to install at
an O version 1.1 see if there's a newer
one on NZXT T's website here I mean if
you haven't installed an ace attack
all-in-one before then this will be new
to you if you have then you've been
doing this for years because the OEM for
this particular unit is a Sutekh NZXT
includes their fan design so you can see
here it's a nine blade fan design that
looks fairly well optimized for static
pressure but it's hard to say without
proper testing equipment there you go it
has blacks leaving on it which of course
diesel will have super InFocus so it
looks super awesome high quality
sleeping on this guy look at that that's
outstanding and black wires inside with
nice tight heat shrink so that's going
to look
just just stunning actually
hardware-wise
we've got all the mounting kit that you
could possibly need for everything from
775 to AMD m3 FM one FM two 1156 1366
and finally 2011 so you can mount this
bad boy on pretty much anything that you
could possibly want to now on the box
itself you can see they've just got a
simple picture they've got their
two-year warranty called out so it's not
the longest warranty ever but honestly
guys ASA Tech's been making these
all-in-one liquid coolers for a long
time so they pretty much know what's up
at this point they're saying 36 percent
more surface area
now that should equate this isn't
probably not even quite right guys
because remember the hub of a fan is
actually the same size whether you're
looking at a 140 millimeter or 120
millimeter fan so we're getting more
actual blade airflow going through the
thing area then just the actual 36
percent improvement so larger surface
area blah blah blah something something
here's some noise and decibels compared
to whatever else they're comparing to
there's some general specs so the motor
speed runs at 2,900 rpm voltages 12 volt
okay okay material rubber
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah completely
sealed ah yes people still ask me this
they're completely sealed they're
maintenance-free these are all in one
liquid coolers so it's all good let's go
ahead and have a close look at the
radiator itself so here we are taken out
of the box Wow look at this this comes
with a really long tubing on it alright
oh look at these look at the sleeving on
this that's outstanding
so NZXT does a really good job actually
of all the stuff that they use their own
sleeping procedures on so there's a
couple things there's their extension
cables there's their fans and now
there's their all-in-one liquid cooling
units look at that all black wires all
beautifully sleeved cables so what do we
have coming out of here
number one is USB so you can use this to
control the software so the Kraken
series does come with control software
it's not a hundred percent mature yet
but in time that should improve got a
nice long USB cable here so what I would
expect to do with this you
I would be mounting it in my case like
this then I would go up around the back
of the motherboard tray looks like you
got enough length to come right under
the bottom of the motherboard or you
could even go off to the right see with
the NZXT logo being on the right there
go behind the motherboard there and then
come up the bottom so that's what I do
in terms of cable routing here we've got
our pm monitoring
I actually know that might that's that's
power so power is gonna go to your CPU
fan header right here you're gonna want
to leave your CPU fan header on full
speed guys and then you're gonna plug in
your what in the heck is this one moment
please
oh yeah that won't work because we're
doing live to tape okay I figured it out
anyway so you can do push pull natively
off of the cooler itself but one of them
is missing the RPM monitoring lead so
that that makes sense though that yeah
that that was awkward okay so let's have
a close look at the unit itself just
gonna go ahead and switch to Diesel's
camera the bottom has a high quality
thermal compound on the copper base and
then the same ASA tech mounting
mechanism that we've seen before the
logo here does illuminate so that should
look really good in your case and the
tubing as I said is quite long now this
is still 1/4 inch tubing however I'm not
convinced that with these all in ones
it's going to make that much of a
difference in terms of performance and
when I compare this to what I've seen
from the H Adi and the H 100 I the
tubing is much more flexible when you
have a nice thick wall and you keep a
1/4 inch tubing versus a 3/8 inch tubing
like I said before I don't think we're
block or pump or flow limited I think
we're surface area limited with these
things it's not like an H Adi performs
better than an H 100 I because of the
fact that it just has thicker tubing it
doesn't work that way more surface area
equals more better
so speaking of surface area the radiator
itself uses quite a dense thin array so
you can actually get right in close
there presumably since diesels taking
care of all that and you can see that
the more pressure you use on the fan for
this guy this will really benefit from a
push-pull setup and it'll also benefit
from pressure optimized fans such as
Noctua NF a 14s those would be a really
good choice for this red
that pretty much takes care of it other
than that we've just got the slightly
rotatable fittings here so you're gonna
have a lot of flexibility in terms of
mounting and also the fact that because
it can be sort of positioned at the back
your case here and then you can maneuver
this almost anywhere without kinking it
you have a lot of flexibility in terms
of your installation so thank you for
