happens but course they're literally
sponsored this video to show off how off
the rails crazy they've gone they
finally did it they have launched their
full lineup of custom water cooling
solutions they're calling it their hydro
X series and they've got over 60 SKUs
like this is the thing that I was always
thinking there's no way they're never
gonna do it because you can't just
launch a CPU block and call that good
enough you need CPU blocks GPU blocks
reservoirs pumps mounts fittings tubing
and we're gonna take you guys all the
way around the booth and have a look at
everything that they've done here let's
start with the CPU block naturally since
its course there they're gonna want
something that's gonna look great in any
showcase PC so they've got a couple of
different models here the xe7 RGB and
the xc9 RGB now they look nearly
identical on the surface except for the
difference in color we've got black on
this one and silver on this one but
under the hood they are a little bit
different so the xe7 uses 0.25
millimeter fins and the xc9 uses 0.2
millimeter fins giving it a slight edge
in terms of performance so the reason
for that is that the XC 9 is designed
for thread Ripper and intel's h EDT
platform and then this one is for your
more mainstream a m4 and LG 11 5x for
the GPU cooler we've got to look that is
quintessentially Corsair so they've got
an extruded aluminum shroud with a
machined acrylic window over here
they've got an included aluminum
backplate and then they've got a bunch
of really nice to have features there's
a flow indicator here they've got
pre-applied thermal compound and thermal
pads which is a time-saver compared to
like cutting out the pads and then
aligning them all yourselves really nice
to have and then the really standout one
to me is actually this right here so
their cooling engine uses the same
skived copper manufacturing process as
their CPU block and that's really unique
for a GPU because normally that would be
quite cost prohibitive the way that they
got around this is by mass producing
this piece and then you can actually see
it over here and then screwing it in and
using a rubber o-ring to attach it to
the rest of the
quite clever Corsair quite clever at
launch they'll have blocks for the 1080
1080 TI 2070 20 80 20 80 TI those are
all founders edition as well as asus
strix 20 80 and 20 80 TI and for the AMD
fans out there radeon vega 56 and 64 now
this next one threw me for a bit of a
loop the cpu block is XE the GPU block
is XG the radiators are XR but for some
reason the reservoir pump combo unit is
XD now there's actually a good reason
for this because Corsair is using a
genuine d5 pump and we're talking the
full rpm PWM controlled one which i
think is an absolutely fantastic choice
and they're offering nothing else which
I also think is an absolutely fantastic
choice the d5 has a well deserved
reputation for its reliability and it's
near silent operation and this is just
such a not being afraid to spend more
money to deliver a better quality
product move from them that I absolutely
have to commend they include a bunch of
different mounting options 120 or 140
millimeter fan mounts as well as a
bottom mount or a back mount for the
case and this is a nice touch they
include a 24 pin jumper so that you can
quickly cycle your power supply on and
off to get lead the air out of your loop
as well as a temperature sensor now one
unusual thing is that the reservoir is
made of the same clear nylon injection
molded plastic as the CPU block and this
was apparently done for durability as
well as resistance against crappy
coolants purposes so that's that's a
very unusual move that must have cost a
pretty penny and of course like with
anything Corsair these days the
customization with RGB lighting is
basically endless they've got full
integration with their IQ software for
different lighting profiles so here I'm
gonna have my friend HP show me some of
the different setups you can do with the
16 LEDs that are in both the CPU and GPU
block and the 10 that are integrated
into their reservoirs and perhaps more
importantly its integrated from a
cooling perspective as well now lots of
different cooling software's
actually do have support for creating
fan profiles that correspond to the
temperature of your system but there's a
fatal flaw whenever you're using water
cooling with most of these setups
because they're designed to use your CPU
temperatures and they're also designed
to set our PM ranges that are more
designed for fans than they are for
pumps so Coursera went and created a
couple of profiles that set more
realistic both fan and separate pump
rpms that correspond to your coolant
temperature because it's using that
built-in temp sensor that's integrated
into their pump and reservoir combo it's
a nice little touch and it's the kind of
thing that makes life a lot simpler
compared to the old days of getting one
of those Ncube t balancers hoping you
can find the freakin drivers that work
and then dialing everything in manually
now that's it for the components that
course are engineered for themselves
from the ground up but quite frankly
with the partners that they've chosen
for some of these other components
there's absolutely no shame in
collaboration so for their radiators
they've got 120 millimeter thick
radiators in triple double and quadruple
sizes right here they've got 140
millimeter slim radiators in triple
double and single and then 120
millimeter radiators in triple double
and single sizes they all use sort of a
medium thin density so they should
perform quite well with low to medium
rpm fins and they worked with hardware
labs on these so you can expect the kind
of quality that you'd get from someone
with literally decades of experience
building water cooling radiators for pcs
on the fitting side of things as well as
tubing again the partnership makes a ton
of sense to me they've got four
different colors available and most of
the popular models in gold black white
and chrome and they worked with bits
power on these for two different sizes
of hard line tubing fittings and then a
single size that goes with their 10
millimeter ID 13 millimeter OD soft
tubing now I would have preferred a
thicker wall tubing but I also
understand that not everybody likes the
look of that and what you do achieve
with the thin wall tubing is very little
of that clear halo around your colored
coolant so for their coolant they've
partnered with mayhem and they're
offering I believe
it is five different colors is that
right including clear there you go so
they've got their green blue clear
purple and red so there you have the
guys irrefutable proof that Corsair
doesn't care how small or how nice your
market is if it exists in the PC space
they will go after it so thanks Corsair
for sponsoring this video and thanks to
you guys for watching it if you disliked
it you know what to do but if you liked
to hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should definitely join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
