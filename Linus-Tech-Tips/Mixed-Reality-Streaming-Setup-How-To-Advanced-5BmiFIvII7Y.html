hear on Linus tech tips today we'll be
doing something that's a little bit more
complicated but we'll give you a truly
awesome results if it is done correctly
what I'm talking about is streaming
mixed reality footage what's that well
if you have a VR headset such as the HTC
vive that we have here in the office you
can actually stream footage of yourself
doing things in a virtual game
environment so to the viewer it will
look like you're walking around in a
fantastical world instead of just your
living room it does this by transposing
the in-game environment onto a green
screen
kula masters new master keys Pro L and
pro s keyboards feature sixteen point
seven million color RGB backlighting
genuine Cherry MX switches and an
industry-leading ARM Cortex processor
learn more at the link in the video
description today we'll be showing you
how to do this in fantastic contraption
a game from North Way games we'd also
like to take this opportunity to give
North Way a shout out as we base this
guide on the mixed reality information
that they provided on their website you
can find a link in the video description
down below all you need to get started
other than a VR headset and a gaming rig
is a green screen an HDMI camcorder and
either an internal or external capture
card with an HDMI port we'll be using an
AVerMedia live gamer portable in our
demonstration today also make sure you
have an HDMI cord long enough to reach
from your capture card to your camcorder
as this will allow you to move your
camcorder to different places around the
room so that you can adjust how your
stream will end up looking this is
especially important if you're getting a
friend to act as a camera person instead
of just putting your camera on a tripod
to get started go ahead and set up your
HTC vive according to the manufacturer's
instructions then get your capture card
installed although external capture
cards are generally connected with a
simple USB cord there are also internal
capture cards that slot into a PCI
Express 1x slot if you'd like to keep
things a little bit tidier after you've
gotten your vibe and your capture card
ready go ahead and start setting up your
green screen green screens come
lots of different sizes so you'll want
to get something that can surround your
play area on at least two sides as well
as something to cover the floor
green-screen fabric actually works
pretty well for this and it's not that
bad to adjust but you will need
something to hang it on
make sure your lighting is adequate as
well generally bright light is better as
it will allow your camera and your
software to more easily separate the
green-screen from everything else next
you'll want to set up your camcorder if
you don't have one don't worry about
buying something super expensive as
realistic effects can be achieved with
many fairly inexpensive models such as a
Sony Handycam just make sure you aren't
using something like a webcam or a phone
camera as it probably won't be good
enough place your camera in a spot that
will capture as much of the play area as
possible without placing areas outside
of your green screen set up in the frame
you don't want to have your stream or
recording ruined because it looks like
some faraway world is directly bordered
by your livingroom couch connect your
camera to your capture cards HDMI input
and you're ready to go at least on the
hardware side next is the software setup
not all games support mixed reality but
the vibe does have a number of games in
its library that do such as fantastic
contraption which has a setting that
enables multiple virtual cameras within
the game this allows your capture
software to use depth information to
combine the VR graphics and the feed
from your real-life camcorder accurately
just open the settings menu in game make
sure toggle depth camera is checked and
enter all zeros in the field labeled
foreground color key you'll need to
setup your capture software next which
can be a little bit more complicated as
it needs to combine three layers the
game foreground the game background and
the feed from your camcorder we're going
to use open broadcasting software or OBS
download install it open it then hit the
plus sign underneath sources and pick
window capture name this layer VR
background and select fantastic
contraption turn off cursor capture then
enter the correct streaming resolution
for fantastic contraption since the
depth camera option splits the screen
into four quadrants you can only stream
at 1/4 of your computer's resolution so
if you're running a monitor at 1080p
you'll need to enter a resolution of 960
by 540 but if you have a 4k display you
can stream in 1920 by 1080 once you've
done this make sure that you grab the
corner of the layer and expand it to
fill the entire canvas
next under sources add the webcam layer
by picking video capture device and then
name it camcorder or honestly whatever
you'd like fill the whole cameras with
the camera layer like you did in the
previous step
then select color key under effects
filters so that your computer will
process the green-screen properly play
with the similarity and smoothness
settings until things look good the last
layer is the vr foreground which you
should now add by following a similar
procedure to the background however this
time deselect the capture any fullscreen
application option and select allow
transparency make sure again to deselect
capture cursor to enter a proper
resolution and to expand the layer to
fill up the canvas the last step is to
sync up your camcorder with what's going
on in the game make sure both the game
and OBS are open then adjust the virtual
camera with the WASD Q and E keys this
is a lot easier if you can get a friend
to stand in the play area with the
controller's in hand so you'll have a
point of reference but this can be done
by just placing the controllers on
something as well this will allow you to
match up the in-game camera system and
your camcorder precisely so the stream
will look realistic also be sure to
adjust the field of view settings by
dragging the third-person fov slider in
the in-game settings until the in-game
virtual controllers match up with
wherever your friend is holding the real
ones however if you want to use a moving
camera you can do this by taping a third
vibe controller to your camcorder which
will cause the game to track its
position making for an even more
interesting visual presentation just
select handheld mode in the in-game
settings menu and sync the cameras using
the previous steps so after you've done
all of this you're finally ready to
stream or record or whatever you want to
do although there are a lot of steps
involved the results should make it look
like you're
firmly in the middle of a virtual world
it won't look exactly James Cameron like
but you will be able to give your
viewers a really cool experience that
can set your channel apart don't stop
don't stop don't stop mmm oh my god I
