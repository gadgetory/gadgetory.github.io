haven't even announced the winner for
yet was really long so this one's going
to be short and sweet this is the
Western Digital one terabyte green WD 10
ears drive it is a one terabyte drive it
has 64 Meg's of cache and we are going
to give it away in a week if you want to
know more information about this
particular green ears drive then you
should check out my unboxing or my full
NCIX
tech tips episode about advanced format
because this is an advanced format drive
also I want your input on something cuz
I'm having a disagreement with the
cameramen he says that if we give away
products that are already open by the
way we're gonna ship a new drive but if
we give away products that are already
open that that's bad but I said if it's
something that we unboxed on our show
then it should be fine so please leave
your comments and don't forget to
subscribe the only way to win is to be
subscribed to both of my channels - tech
tips as well as NCIX calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
