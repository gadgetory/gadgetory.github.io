backup plus for Mac it is time machine
compatible and it is a backup for your
digital life including well your time
machine which is I mean apparently
apples our time machines no I'm just
kidding an overtime machine is basically
it's just you know apples clever
branding for you know what I don't have
to prove I know what time machine is I
think you guys believe me I know what
time machine is so yeah it works with
time machine it also works with Facebook
so it's really cool about all of your
backup plus drives is the software
that's included with a backup plus Drive
not only backs up your computer that can
also backup data that you have stored in
the cloud I mean remember Facebook is
just cloud storage basically I mean your
take a bunch of photos you upload them
to Facebook and then you don't
necessarily think about how safe they
are you know what if what if Facebook
didn't exist tomorrow and it took all
your photos with it well this way you
can make sure that your Facebook photos
and other social media sites can be
backed up as well I heard that they're
going to be working on adding support
for YouTube so I really hope they do
that although it wouldn't necessarily
work for me because I have a lot of
stuff on YouTube but if you just have
like you know a couple pictures of your
dog or like your baby that you wanted to
show you know babies grandma or whatever
on a YouTube account you want to make
sure you have it backed up somewhere
this will work for you now it is
compatible with Mac and PC the only real
difference between a Mac Edition Drive
and a PC Edition Drive is the included
cable so let's have a look at what is
included with our Mac Edition drives
we've got a Quick Start Guide plug the
thing into the other thing in the first
thing Seagate limited warranty that is a
two year warranty on this particular
retail product we've got in here all of
our cables so there's your power cable
for the unit itself as well as a USB to
cable and the Mac Edition I think
actually includes more cables a firewire
800 cable so that is once again more
useful for Mac users than it is for PC
users because not a lot of pcs use
firewire 800 because it is
a slow redundant standard at this point
in time which must be three just giving
it the old how do you do in terms of
performance so the doc down here is this
is kind of cool why does it do that okay
well it has two firewire 800 parts why
does it do that oh can you can you daisy
chain a firewire huh
okay so it has power in firewire as well
as USB two so you can use it on a PC
performance will just kind of byte
compared to using USB 3 or a firewire
800 so the drive is pretty bog-standard
okay so you got your ventilation at the
top it looks pretty slick it has a soft
touch feel that's another difference
between the Apple SKU and the PC SKU
that we saw before that one had more of
a shiny finish to it whereas this one is
a more of a matte finish in terms of
ventilation you've also got ventilation
at the back so passive airflow is going
to kind of come up through here float up
through the top I mean drive to run so
cool these days especially sea gates
latest ones using the one terabyte
platter so this is a 2 terabyte drive
which means there's only two platters in
there it also has a fair bit of metal in
the enclosure so it has some weight to
it and this piece up here is actually
metal so you don't have to worry too
much about the heat just getting
contained in there now what I love about
sea gates drives now originally I was
sort of this was a bit of a
head-scratcher for me because they
released this drive and the sales pitch
as far as I could tell was like you buy
a drive and then you like it doesn't
have an interface on it and you like the
interfaces chipsets in the cable and you
plug it in and then you have whatever
interface you want now that it's sort of
more mature and they have a lot more
products as part of the ecosystem it
totally makes sense to me now so instead
of building expensive enclosures that
have a bunch of different chipsets in
them
Seagate builds a less expensive
enclosure that has no logic in it
whatsoever it's just an enclosure with a
SATA interface at the back no problem
then they actually put the logic that
you need into a cable or a docking
station or whatever also the firewire
chipset in the power is all done in here
not in here this is just a drive that is
you know nice and compatible and whatnot
this is one of their last generation
notebook like portable drives so that's
USB 3 in fact if this you know drive in
here could be powered by this I could
actually just do that because it's just
so no I can't even do that they're not
gonna let me do that okay well I thought
maybe but because this requires a drive
that's a little power enough to be
powered by a USB port and it probably
makes sense that they don't let me do
that because it would just be bad try to
draw too much power from the USB port
and then no one would be happy ok so
this goes on here now not only this but
you can actually take this drive and you
can swap it on to a variety of other
different docks whether they're USB 3 at
the back or whether you have like the
whole big like Thunderbolt one so you
can daisy chain a bunch of thunderbolt
external drives and another thing that
you can do with them is you can actually
just keep one dot next to your computer
whether it's thunderbolt or USB 3 or
whatever else the case may be I'd
recommend something pretty
high-performance if you're gonna use it
to actually run applications or or edit
photos or video off of but what's cool
about it is you can actually just kind
of leave it there and then you can use
these these drives more as like
cassettes so you go and you keep a bunch
on your bookshelf you label them with
whatever you know data it happens to be
on them you know like you know my
private video collection or whatever
else the case may be and then you just
go and plug in whichever one you happen
to need at a given time and you're good
to go just and you're done yeah unplug
it and put it somewhere safe and then no
big problems can occur so I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
