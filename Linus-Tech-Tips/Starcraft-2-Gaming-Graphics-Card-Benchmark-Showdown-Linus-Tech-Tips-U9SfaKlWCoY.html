overview and review and roundup and the
results were so shocking that slick peed
himself that is quite literally what
happened see I can tell because when I
put my hand on the stain and smell it
it's most assuredly urine dude ok so
anyway we're using the latest drivers on
both the g-force and Radeon graphics
cards and we're following our new format
which is a very exciting format where we
take four different price brackets this
time about a hundred bucks about two
hundred bucks
about three hundred bucks and about four
hundred bucks so no matter how much you
want to spend on a graphics card we're
gonna tell you what is the optimal
solution whether it's from the green
team or the red team now our Starcraft 2
benchmark is custom slick did some read
magical whatever he did and he created
this playthrough where the guys fight
each other and it's very very intensive
so it gives you kind of a worst case
scenario not necessarily something that
you'd observe when you're you know you
all have like one hatchery and like you
know two zerglings over here like that's
not what we're looking at we're looking
at the very worst case and right latest
drivers so catalyst 13.1 and the Nvidia
drivers three thirteen point ninety six
we use only official drivers not beta
drivers you used beta drivers didn't you
okay
well from now on we're only gonna use
beta drivers are from now on we're only
gonna use official drivers but this time
we use to beta drivers so calm down
anyway so our hundred dollar approx
price point has the Radeon 7770 up
against the GeForce GTX 650 so in this
case we had an MSI Platinum Edition card
and a sapphire whatever card this is
vapor X I think something along those
lines power Edition sure power addition
we do overclock all the cards but we
don't take them to the absolute maximum
that they can do we scour the interwebs
and we find sort of what ninety percent
of the people who are using these cards
are able to attain and we run it those
settings because the way we figure it
we've done guides about this you should
probably be overclocking your car
if you own one because that's the right
thing to do so at this particular price
bracket the Radeon card was 119 bucks
the geforce card was about 5% cheaper
but the 7770 just ran away with it at
this price point you can tell the
Starcraft 2 is not necessarily limited
by the by the actual power of the GPU
because you can see that when we step up
to a 78 70 in a GTX 660 this radio
number doesn't change but it seems to be
more to do with driver optimizations so
in this case the red team card was a
little bit less expensive than the green
team card so the green team had a 660 I
believe this is our 660 yeah 660 twin
frozer and then it was a 7870 for the
red team now our 7870 happens to be a
dog of an overclocker so this is
probably kind of a worst case scenario
but once again the red team comes away
by a boat looks like about 20 percent in
terms of the performance Delta okay so
our next price band is don't do that
they're not $300 so we've got the 7950
up against the 660ti the 7950 wins by
about 10% but notice here guys and this
is that ultra extreme presets 1080p no
anti-aliasing notice here though that
this is only a 10% difference and this
number is still pretty much the same as
the 7770 finally we get up into the very
upper echelon cards the 7970 versus the
670 where finally for whatever reason
AMD's graphics cards are able to push a
few more frames out in this game and the
670 hits that number around 64 FPS where
the Radeon cards were performing up till
this time so it's still about 10-15
percent slower so what does this mean
basically that Starcraft 2 is purely
optimization driven in terms of how the
game runs on one card versus another
also that we are extremely cpu limited
on the radio on side to the point where
you can pay $400 for a graphics card or
you can pay $100 for a graphics card to
run this game and you're going to end up
with pretty much the same as
so thank you for checking out this video
don't forget to check out the video
which I've annotated in this video
showing you the benchmarking procedure
that we use for Starcraft 2 so you can
replicate it on your own system find out
what's up the test bench that we use is
our 3930k overclocked to 4 gigahertz
test bench we pulled out the RAM because
we're using it for something else right
now but the point is it has 16 gigs of
RAM and those seesee vertex 4 SSD and
that is pretty much all she wrote don't
forget to subscribe - tech tips from our
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and I can't wait to get this
buttoned shirt off this is just horrible
just like why am I wearing this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
