never covered the oneplus one was it
because I thought their offer to lend it
to me for less than a week while one of
their employees happened to be on
vacation in Vancouver was insulting and
ridiculous was it their offensive and
irresponsible advertising campaigns was
it their trying so hard to be viral
invite system for ordering maybe a
little bit of all three but D brand
skins a great partner of ours through a
phone in the mail to me and basically
said you have to do the oneplus two so I
figured all right let's see what the
fuss is about let's see if it lives up
to the hype oh wait hold on on the
subject of deep brand and hype there the
presenting sponsor for scrapyard Wars 3
and the production schedule is locked in
it's going to be a three-way between me
Luke and Austin Evans
so slam that like button if you're amped
and you think Austin is going to be an
awesome guest star okay now you can roll
the intro
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors click on the link in
the video description to learn more
oneplus comes right out of the gate
boldly declaring their second generation
device to be a 2016 flagship killer and
obviously if they're going to run around
and say things like that it better have
the horses to back it up so CPU why is
the oneplus 2 sports the controversial
Snapdragon 810 1.8 gigahertz octa-core
processor paired with an Adreno 430 GPU
which should handle the phone's 1080p
display with relative ease RAM and
storage specs aren't that clear-cut with
the 16 gig storage model being paired
with three gigs of system memory and the
64 gig version getting a one gig bump to
four gigs the display is a five and a
half inch 1080p IPS LCD covered with
Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and features an
LT PS glass substrate which is more
expensive than both silicon and eggs oh
and is accompanied on the top by a
5-megapixel selfie camera and on the
bottom by a row of capacitive touch
sensitive buttons with the center being
used as a home button camera launch
button and fingerprint sensor for quick
authentication cool beans I love this
feature as long as it works it seems
that some units mine being among them
may suffer from non-responsive home
buttons maybe something to do with
chassis grounding or something like that
fortunately you can use on-screen
buttons by flipping one switch in the
settings menu meet physically I really
have started just glossing over most
phones these days because aren't they
all just basically ripoffs of the
original iPhone actually in this case no
for starters the notification modifier
button on the left side has not two but
three positions to allow audible sounds
for all notifications priority
notifications only and alarms only a
nifty little inclusion the right side
lock and volume adjust buttons are
flippin awesome
protruding just enough to be easily felt
without looking at the phone and with
enough resistance that I didn't
accidentally mash them all the time
while trying to hold the phone and hold
the phone indeed is this what it looks
like at the bottom yes
on the bottom are the regrettably well
bottom mounted but surprisingly loud and
clear speakers and a reversible USB
type-c port for charging if you want to
know all about the benefits of USB
type-c we've got a video about it which
you can check out here but in a nutshell
it's reversible along with the cable
oneplus includes it's freakin awesome
it's more durable and it can both handle
more power and transfer data faster than
previous slim standards like micro B but
that's the first in a series of gotchas
with the oneplus 2 thanks to the USB 2
backbone the type c port only operates
at USB 2 power and speeds and for
whatever reason Qualcomm's quick charge
2.0 technology is not supported in this
config so you'll have to wait three
hours or more for a full charge not a
big deal to me since the included 3300
milliamp hour non removable battery was
enough for me to get through all but the
most intense days but it might be a
factor for you watch our number to 1
plus maybe billing this phone as a
flagship killer from a performance
standpoint but it's not like with more
premium devices you aren't getting
anything for your extra money either and
the two fails to deliver really any cool
standout features beyond its charging
port no water resistance to speak of no
SD expansion although it does have dual
SIM slots under the removable back cover
which is still quite unusual in North
American models and no NFC support to
name a few this last one is particularly
perplexing as while I've never been a
regular user of NFC its ubiquity among
Android phones has made Google even go
as far as to integrate it into their new
phone migration wizard with who knows
what else depending on the technology in
the future and on the subject of the
future and improvement oneplus really
does seem to be banking on that to sell
these phones the software is
refreshingly unloaded and has some great
inclusions like a system-wide dark theme
gestures for like double tap to wake
double home for camera and Swift keys
fantastic third-party keyboard app
included but it just isn't
completely polished in a way that's sort
of hard to quantify like reconnecting to
Wi-Fi automatically was really hit or
miss for me auto brightness adjustments
were very sudden and jarring which
hasn't been an issue for me with other
phones for a couple of years a voiceover
LTE on band 12 a must for t-mobile
customers is coming according to a
reddit post somewhere and the camera is
getting more capabilities at some
undisclosed time which I guess leads us
pretty well into the main pillar of a
smartphone video these days the camera
it's pretty darn good the main camera
sports optical image stabilization laser
autofocus and a dual LED flash and
captures 13 megapixel images and up to
4k 30fps videos it handles low-light
reasonably well and if we ignore the
pretty rubbish viewfinder responsiveness
and some stupidity in the app like that
swiping in from the left can try to try
to change camera mode sometimes pulls
down the notification tray the two gets
great marks here not because oneplus has
dethroned the LG g4 Samsung Galaxy s6 or
the iPhone 6 all of which have excellent
cameras but because the two costs half
as much as those other flagship devices
which I think leads us pretty well into
the conclusion I still think the invite
system is complete bull but the oneplus
2 is still a winner in my book I love
the price and I agree with most if not
all of the ways that oneplus has skimped
on the to the build quality feels great
with a reassuringly premium weight and
with the gently curved back and
extraordinarily slim bezels making it
feel more like a phone a quarter of an
inch smaller diagonally a 1080p display
makes a ton of sense to me at this
screen size and I will trade both
wireless charging and quick charging for
a more robust connector on a device that
I plan to use over the long term but the
lack of NFC baffles me and the inclusion
of a second SIM slot instead of
expandable storage is a trade-off that
in my mind doesn't work well especially
for owners of the 16 gig model
you know what else is likely to work
well for owners of the 1+2 Adi brand
skin you guys may or may not have
noticed this but throughout the b-roll
of this video you have been looking at
one of their precision cut vinyl wraps
that serve a couple of purposes
number one is it protects the phone from
incidental scratches no not the screen
surface itself but all the parts that
you would actually want to cover with a
vinyl wrap and number two is it allows
you to personalize the phone they've
actually got a wide variety of
mix-and-match different combinations
that you can play around with on their
site they've got a configuration tool so
you can be like yeah what would my phone
look like with the woodgrain on the
front and like bright orange on the back
and they've actually they've actually
got the logo even cut out on the oneplus
2 which is pretty darn spiffy looking
and then another additional white sort
of leather grain vinyl wrap over top of
the camera and the flash area really
really awesome stuff and like I said
actually earlier in this video they've
been a longtime supporter of the show
and just generally good guys so check
them out over at dee brand.com they've
got all kinds of great stuff for phones
tablets gaming consoles controllers all
kinds of good stuff over there so that's
pretty much it guys if you disliked this
video hit that dislike button I'm not
afraid of it if you liked it though do
please hit the like button get
subscribed or even consider supporting
us by buying a cool t-shirt like this
one supporting us directly through our
community forum with little supporter
badge or even just changing your amazon
bookmark to one with our affiliate code
the instructions for which you can find
there now that you're done doing all
that stuff you're probably wondering
what to watch next um when is this
coming out okay
so I think in theory my desk PC build
log should be out by the time you're
watching this so hopefully we can link
to that otherwise maybe we'll just put
something else now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
