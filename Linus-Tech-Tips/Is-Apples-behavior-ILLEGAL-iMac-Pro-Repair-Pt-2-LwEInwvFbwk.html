his eye Mac Pro damaged while
disassembled ill-informed youtuber
bemoans apple repair policies after
breaking iMac pro youtube channel claims
Apple is refusing to fix its broken iMac
pro how is it even possible that so many
people don't check this at all
and the worst part is that this is far
from over
thankfully I've got I fix it
I fix its Pro Tech tool kit we'll get
you through any electronics repair
challenge just visit ifixit.com forward
slash - to get your own today
so first off I really want to give a
huge thank you to everyone out there who
contributed advice suggestions or even
offered to come and help us out directly
without you guys this update video would
not have been possible and even worse
than that I don't think we'd be seeing
all the discussion that we have about
our circumstances and what they mean for
right to repair fair repair would open a
whole market of reuse for customers and
their electronics the pressures
frustrations and limited access of
standing on a line to speak to someone
at the Genius Bar or they don't even
serve appletinis will be lifted from
consumers okay so a refresher then for
those of you who missed it or forgot
we knew that we weren't going to get
warranty service on our iMac Pro and
we're not even talking warranty service
we understood we would have to pay we
wanted to pay but we did at least expect
Apple to be able to offer us a
reasonable repair solution and that's
how the go expectation I'm not talking
like you know when angry do you guys
even know who I am I'm Lennis texted
like I'm not talking about that kind of
thing
Apple actually averted a similar PR
crisis with Quinn Nelson over at snazzy
labs by just eating the cost of an iMac
Pro and sending him a new one
but as he pointed out so I did walk out
of the store with a brand new iMac but I
asked myself the question what they have
done this for anyone and our goal here
was to have the normal customer
experience so there have been some
arguments in favor of Apple's position
here not repairing this and let's
address the main ones before we go any
further
starting with Apple is refusing to quote
you a repair cost because it will be
higher than the cost of a brand new
machine you idiot and my response to
that is pretty simple a Mac is not
special it's not magic it's just a
computer so a broken screen maybe a
fried motherboard and also maybe a bad
power supply does not
turn a $5,000 workstation into scrap
metal we know from our price breakdown
of the iMac Pro that Apple charges about
market rates actually for their parts
when you buy them integrated in a
complete system so even if I picked
top-of-the-line components the worst
case scenario parts cost should be about
2,100 US dollars and if they were
willing to provide those parts we'd
expect to pay a couple hours of labor
for another few hundred dollars or so
definitely not enough to cancel out the
value of the CPU RAM SSD chassis and
cooler that are probably all still
working they're not that difficult to
repair the reality of it is we just
slipped these things do happen
next up is the liability argument what
about Apple's liability for the long
term functionality of that machine well
what about it I mean if you take your
computer said I don't know let's say
Geek Squad for repairs they'll do the
work complete a wider check of the
machine to see if there's anything else
wrong with it and then even then
warranty their repairs in case they miss
something I mean is the argument really
that Apple of all people can't do a
comprehensive check of its own hardware
and has so little faith in the training
of its technicians that they can't
guarantee your repair if that were true
I don't think we should buy computers
from them at all this kind of stuff
industry standard stuff back to the
training bit though that one was a tough
nut to crack so we were actually accused
of making false claims about the
availability of Apple's repair
certification for the iMac Pro with
other publications going as far as to
contact Apple Authorized service
providers in the states who confirmed
that they already had it so here's what
actually happened it was available to at
least some a
peas at the time we did our video
however it wasn't available to our local
AAAS P so that got me thinking well
there's my chair maybe this is like a
canada-us thing but then I spoke
personally to an American ASP technician
who said and this is after our local
shop got certified mind you that he
wasn't going to be able to get it for a
couple more months so something about
the way that apples rolling these
programs out to their AAS peas isn't
quite right here
but for now though we need to get back
to addressing the problems that we
identified in our first video and fixing
this stupid professional workstation
that has been out of commission for
months now is well that's that's pretty
much the problem so coming back to
certifications the training and parts
availability has actually improved
dramatically since our first video and
we were finally able to take our iMac to
an ASP who assured us that they could
get the job done at the end so thanks
for watching guys if this video sucked
you know what - hahaha no I'm just
kidding nothing is ever that easy you
see while we managed to get our display
replaced for a reasonable price
thanks to qualifying for what they call
return pricing where you send the
original part back to Apple for disposal
we actually broke the warranty void if
removed stickers around our CPU socket
this one right here so what that means
is that because of that sticker we
didn't qualify for return pricing on our
logic board which it turns out is a
really bad thing
because Apple wants five thousand five
hundred Canadian rupees plus tax for a
new logic board which for some reason
includes both the CPU and the RAM
even though contrary to what a lot of
our detractors thought they are socketed
and not soldered on this particular
system so that is about double of apples
old price for this hardware when they
sell you the system originally and that
is how much they charge the AAS Peas
so if an authorized service provider
fails to return a defective part during
the exchange for any reason they get
dinged for the price of the replacement
part in what is a clear effort to
prevent any spare parts from making
their way out into the wild which makes
it pretty hard to get your hands on this
stuff and interestingly this is far from
the only punitive measure that Apple
appears to be willing to inflict upon
its partners from talking to them we
were struck by the culture of fear that
Apple cultivates among its authorized
service providers they explicitly
prevent them from ordering replacement
parts for the sake of having them on
hand so what that means is that they
require a work order to be placed before
the part will even be shipped which
creates massive delays of potentially
weeks for something as simple as a ram
swap which makes the ASP look bad in
comparison to Apple's own service
centers but that's Apple's policy to
make matters worse if an ASP attempts to
order a part that they don't yet have
the certification for Apple will send
them a fine instead of the parts they
ordered and this is all for the
privilege of having access to apples
supply chain oh and the best part is
anyone caught talking about any of this
to anybody outside of Apple for them
this is grounds for severe retaliation
revocation of ASP status or
certifications fines or even potential
legal action only a handful of brave
souls were willing to tell us their
names or the names of the shops they ran
or worked for and of course we are going
to be keeping all of that info
in private in order to protect them by
comparison
Samsung has a web portal that you can
log into and order any replacement phone
parts that you could want
so at that kind of markup over a sticker
the a ASP option was obviously out we
really would have been better off
ordering a brand-new iMac Pro but
another one of you guardian angels out
there who also shall not be named for
legal reasons stepped up to the plate
now we're getting to the point where the
solutions that were working on wouldn't
be available to Joe average but even
though it was a lot of work we really
wanted to know how deep this rabbit hole
goes so it ended up being a case of I
know a guy who knows a guy who knows a
guy so given how much money was being
exchanged I was sketched out to the max
but after a series of back-alley deals
like almost literally back-alley deals
our contact managed to get us this a
brand-new iMac pro logic board complete
with CPU and RAM for two thousand US
dollars and here's the kicker if our
contact D ghostified because right now
he's sort of gone dark if our contract
shows back up again and can get us
exchanged pricing that could actually
become as low as zero dollars so uh-oh
excellent I've got a calculator so let's
let's do some quick math for you guys
our screen and power supply replacement
at the ASP cost was roughly fourteen
hundred US dollars including labor and
shipping thanks to return pricing at
worst we can add another two thousand
dollars on top of that so logic board
and thirty four hundred US dollars how
much does an imac pro cost again so
sorry haters it looks like you're wrong
I guess if it wasn't for Apple's
anti-consumer
anteye partner and possibly looking at
what's going on with Wright to repair in
the States right now illegal policies it
would be possible to get the replacement
parts for less than the retail price of
a new unit only one thing remains now
then we still don't actually know if our
Frankenstein machine works or not and I
could get Anthony to test it but I think
we all know what happened last time I
can't believe that some people thought
that this was intended to deceive the
audience by the way it was clearly a CSI
style dramatic reenactment look at the
sparks
we're not even good at special effects
anyway this video is long enough already
and I think I've got a better idea and
some of you will probably already know
where I'm going with this
hey Louis I think I've got a fun little
project for us have you ever worked on
an iMac Pro before we don't stop
watching yet I have a teaser and an
offer for you the teaser is we have a
video up coming with Wendell from level
one time
gaming on Linux it's better than you
think unless you think it's perfect in
which case it's not better than you
think but don't worry about that also P
ia go check out private Internet access
for the VPN that does well pretty much
what a VPN does it encrypts your traffic
and makes it so that it's harder to
track you on the internet it's great go
check it out at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching you
guys if you dislike this video you can
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed and maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description particularly iFixit stuff
I'm not sure if we're recommending the
iMac pro at this point also down there
is our merch store which has cool shirts
like this one and our community forum
