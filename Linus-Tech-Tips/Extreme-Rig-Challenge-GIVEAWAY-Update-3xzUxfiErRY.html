for your favorite Xtreme rigs a trig
challenge intel.com the intel extreme
rig challenge is back and more extreme
than ever
nine of the world's extreme s system
builders are squaring off to build the
most shoot what's the word I'm looking
for
yeah that's the one the most extreme
gaming rigs in the history of extrema t
but wait it gets extreme but seriously
you yes you have a chance to win the
winning rig just by voting you vote then
a system wins then you win the system
that one it's literally a win-win
situation the contestants have already
started building and have each uploaded
their own build log videos revealing
just how extreme sorry insane it's
barely caught myself there these builds
are going to be cyber Power has returned
from the future and brought with them a
spherical and transparent in win winbot
case equipped with voice commands and
facial recognition I personally cannot
wait to see how they customized this
thing I really hope they call it the
power ball because you know you might
win it meanwhile big things are
happening at the site axe HQ where once
again the team is thinking completely
outside or at least on top of the box
they're using two PC of 11 cases mounted
together with custom glass and a metric
crap ton of radiators now this is what
we expect from an extreme rig all I did
it again and in a less alien but equally
daring move main gear has opted to use
their new F 131 case with an apex fully
integrated water cooling system that
they engineered at the same time they
designed it now obviously it looks
awesome but there's a tricky part the F
131 is a medium-sized M ATX chassis that
the team is going to have to modify in
order to squeeze in the
full ATX asus rog Strix x 299 XE gaming
motherboard that is one of the secret
ingredients in this year showdown it's
probably worth the effort though I mean
how else would they get RS ink RGB
lighting with an all-new addressable RGB
header a supreme FX sound card for the
flattest of frequency responses and a
metal frame to support the heavy duty
GPUs that we expect to see the
competitors load into their rigs when
they release their future build box so
in the next batch of blue logs the
competitors will be showing off the
cooling systems that we'll be using for
the Intel Core i 9 extreme edition
processor that will power each rig this
puppy has intel turbo boost max
technology 3.0 and 44 PCIe lanes for
mega scalability and then finally in the
third wave of build logs the teams will
be highlighting their peripherals their
RAM which I assume will be RGB and the
Intel obtained 900p SSD that they'll be
using this is Intel's fastest nvme drive
featuring 3d crosspoint technology for
incredibly low and consistent latency so
stay tuned and remember that you yes you
the mere mortal out there actually have
a chance to own the winning rig just by
casting your vote a trig challenge dot
