blog video all about surround gaming
performance and shotguns the shotguns
and how they don't kill dudes like are
you serious I'm half expecting him to
get up at this point get up go nope
we'll get up okay that's fine that's
cool so I'm not going to spend too much
time on gameplay this is the gtx 660ti
from galaxy and we are going to go ahead
and show you guys some performance
numbers so we tested a cross-section of
games here's our surround perf cross
section of the excel chart some of the
cross section anymore what happened to
the graph one tackle you Luke better
start over so let's start with crisis to
crisis to this is running alt for
presets so totally unrealistic for these
guards if we turn it down to very high
runs more like 35 40 FPS on the 660 ti
but it does give us an idea of how these
cards perform against each other so you
can see the 660 ti does leg a little bit
behind the 670 which performs pretty
much neck-and-neck with the 7950 since
the 7950 and the 670 are both a little
bit more expensive than the 660 ti all
of this pretty much stands to reason so
we're going to go ahead and create new
charts and graphs in real time so
amazing you guys are seeing a real tech
tip here so this is battlefield 3 and we
have to add the data label every time
because for some reason someone should
do like excel tips for Linus about how
to make it slide on after we do that
every time so 660ti once again maybe
it's due to the fact that the 7950 has
three gigs of memory maybe it's due to
the fact that it's just not quite as
fast as a 79-54 pushing huge resolutions
which could be related to memory
bandwidth again comes probably back to
memory but the 670 manages to keep pace
with the 7950 well to 660 ti legs behind
a little bit it should however be noted
that 660 ti if you can get a model that
over
is actually a reasonably good
overclocker and you can expect to get up
to those 670 levels of performance
without any difficulty so scary Skyrim
now we just have to add our data label
again and you can see once again the 660
ti does like behind Skyrim really
benefits from something to do with the
7950 and it is definitely the big winner
in terms of surround gaming however it
should be noted that it's not
necessarily all about surround gaming
there are other things in this world
such as the fact that you can enable
stereo 3d should you see fit on the
nvidia cards whereas honestly with the
HD 3d is not is not quite there compared
to 3d vision these are very high presets
hydrophilic correctly alright which are
to add data labels and for some reason
our label ok hold on site guys for
whatever reason we couldn't get which or
two to run at all on the radeon card and
this could have been just a random
driver issue we are using the latest
drivers but there was just nothing we
could do about it and short of adding
different cards to our comparison there
wasn't a whole lot we could do to bring
me results from the radeon side so we
ended up having to stick with that our
last one very demanding game metro 2033
and this is on i think if i think they
call it very high so we didn't have
depth of field on but other than that
pretty much cranked and you can see in
this guy's gonna make my adjustments
here you can see in this guy the 660 ti
once again legs behind the 7950 a little
bit but the 670 does pretty well so
what's the conclusion here conclusion is
660ti is fantastic and actually performs
incredibly well for single monitor
gaming if you guys saw the 1080p
performance review that i already did
then you'll know that already it
performs pretty much right up there with
the 70
950 however when we get into very high
resolutions surround gaming scenarios
the 7950 stretches its legs a little bit
with its extra memory bandwidth its
extra memory at all and that is
personally what I think is is making the
difference here so thank you for
