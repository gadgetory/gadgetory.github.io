quite a while the weather's beautiful
perfect for flying we've got the parrot
ar.drone 2.0 here today this is
basically like the original Pei parrot
ar.drone
except that it is smarter faster its
higher definition it's like more
maneuverable it's got need more features
so you can like flip around and stuff so
basically it's like the air drone except
way better I mean one of the things that
I said when I first saw the air drone is
I'm not really that excited about a our
drones but what I'm excited about is
where this is heading this is the next
evolutionary step so they've taken the
low resolution camera on the drone v1
and added an HD camera so you can view
on your tablet or on your smartphone in
1280 by 720 HD they've added intuitive
smile cane to the smartphone control
isn't new it's also available in both
the market and the App Store although
it's called Google Play now I guess at
launch which the v1 wasn't YouTube ready
okay I suppose most video recording
devices could be called YouTube ready
what else we got on here okay easy
Kinect yeah we got that so HD front
camera and qvg a vertical camera so they
haven't upgraded the bottom camera but
that's okay because it's just to keep it
from drifting side-to-side you tilt tilt
control record and share ah yes
video recording ar.drone v1 did not come
in the native free flight app from
parrot with video recording capability
v2 does so people were putting like HD
heroes and all that on their drones now
you don't have to you can use the front
camera to record in HD video and share
with hot share with friends through the
control application available in the App
Store and Android Market automatic
camera moves okay high stability Wow
automatic static lead up to 50 meters
high when commands are released that's
cool
so the original drone couldn't really go
that high and retain a certain amount of
control it looks like they've improved
prove that aspect as well carbon
or Central cross okay let's move right
along here stabilization system photo
video recording fifty meter hundred and
sixty five foot range yep I believe that
because we took even a drone v1 which
was using Wireless G the distance of
this entire parking lot here you can see
that's pretty far away
drone v2 with wireless and should be
even better real-time video / real-time
video feedback yep cool
okay let's get it opened up I'm actually
pretty stoked here oh yeah the apps so
the game apps if you know other people
who own an AR Drone you can download
these apps and you can play virtual
games where it's like an augmented
reality type of gaming experience thing
going on
so it feels lighter than the original
drone actually that's kind of
interesting move right along let's have
a look at what we've got included so
first thing that's included is your
outdoor hull so this one doesn't have
the protective cover around the
propellers so the advantage is you get
better battery life and you get better
maneuverability but the disadvantage is
if you get too close to a tree you're
not gonna have that protective bumper
zone that well protects you I would
suggest flying the AR Drone with the
indoor haul at first until you get a
little bit used to it even though it's
not quite as fast and not quite as
exciting to fly ar.drone 2.0 batteries
so they have changed the battery design
as well as the charger design from the
original AR Drone so if you have
existing batteries you will need to get
the new one and the new charger as well
go ahead and try that on there now it's
a nice little clip in design where the
old one was actually kind of get over it
includes all the adapters you need for
various regions so there's my North
American one but no matter where you
live you just throw it on there and
you're ready to charge up your battery
it also includes some helpful little
stickers these are great for augmented
reality games you can also do neat
things with the drone like you can put
these on things like your hat you can
set the drone to follow you around
because they are designed to recognize
these stickers also includes a thick old
manual so they recommend for 14 up for
the ar.drone 2.0 I can see why because
you know you bust up your AR drone your
your 10 year old busts up their air
drone on like the first time they're
flying if they're going to be pretty
disappointed but you kind of expect that
to happen with young kids it is pretty
easy to fly assuming that it's at least
as easy as the v1 which I'm sure it is
but you can make mistakes it does happen
from time to time so in here we got your
basic controls this is good because you
started however I would definitely
recommend watching some of parents
YouTube videos or I'm gonna be doing
more of a video review of this one later
and you can check that out as well if
you want some more tips on flying let's
have a look at some specs here so we
already covered this you've got a
wide-angle lens that's important for
navigation because you don't want to
just have tunnel vision right in front
of you if you don't have line of sight
to the drone so if you're actually
navigate
by the video feed you're gonna want to
be able to see what's on your left and
your right to get around it or over it
or whatever else not run into it video
storage on the flight with Wi-Fi
directly to a remote device or on a USB
key so you can actually plug a USB key
right into the air drone right here very
very cool stuff the recording not much
else to say about that robust structure
so extended polypropylene EPP hulls okay
they feel lighter than the old one so if
nothing else that's good foam to isolate
inertial Center from the engines
vibrations
cool carbon fiber tubes which are
located here no that's not right here so
the central cross is made of carbon
fiber total weight 380 grams of thought
their hull 420 with the indoor hull
high-grade 30% fiber charge nylon
plastic parts this is important because
the AR Drone is incredibly durable I've
actually had my drone v1 fall for the
heights in excessive here just directly
down on its side with an outdoor hull
and actually not be damaged I was able
to pick it right back up
do a quick check quick visual inspection
and fly it again immediately so yes
the replacement parts are you know
they're there for you but odds are you
won't need them right away even if you
crash a few times unless you're
incredibly unlucky liquid repelling nano
coating on the ultrasound sensors so
that's kind of cool
fully repairable all parts instructions
for repairing are available on the
internet their instructions are
outstanding I actually had them crash my
AR Drone v1 at the Vancouver men's show
they flew it up to the very top of the
ceiling of a warehouse so we're talking
about three stories up and then it hit
something and fell down they lost
control while I wasn't there to
supervise them using my drone so it
busted the central crotch it took me a
couple hours to repair but using the
videos available from parrot I didn't
waste any time so I just had to get
myself a new central cross alright
electronic assistance check this out
this thing basically has a tablet in it
one gigahertz arm cortex a8 processor
with 800 megahertz a video DSP one
gigabit ddr2 RAM at 200 megahertz which
is plenty Wi-Fi and as I mentioned
before it's got an accelerometer a
gyroscope a pressure sensor as well as
the 60 FPS vertical vertical Q VGA
camera for ground speed measurement okay
I guess they're using it for speed
measurement now to the the vertical
camera which is located here on the
drone if I can find it
it used to be located here on the drone
here on the here on the drone is also
used to keep it from drifting so if on a
windy day like today it's easy for the
wind to blow the drone a little to this
side but it can look at this line and
readjust itself to make sure that it
doesn't drift all over the place all
right going right back along three axis
magnetic meters six degree position
ultrasound sensors for ground altitude
measurement so that's pretty cool as
well I'll show you the ultrasound
sensors these guys are right here so
there's a transmitter and a receiver
this tells the drone within a very very
accurate degree of measurement how high
it is off the ground and finally yes
it's very easy to fly this much is true
we already know this haha motors so
they've upgraded the motors as well
specific high propel drag so bunch of
specs here that probably don't mean that
much to you unless you are a total you
know RC motor geek but there you go
water-resistant cool stuff so in summary
drone 2 is awesomer than drone 1 and
pretty much every possible lake includes
basically the same package you got your
outdoor haul your indoor haul your
battery and your charger as well as the
drone itself and I am very very excited
to take this thing out for our flight so
I just want to show you guys a quick
sort of visual tour of the drone so
there's your there's how you swap the
hole just pick it up it's held on with a
magnet which is stored in here so once
you pop it into place it's not going to
come off but it's also easy to remove if
you want to okay your battery gets held
in the harness right here plugs in your
power right there and your USB recording
it's done right here I'd recommend using
a lightweight USB key not something
really heavy you don't want to affect
the balance of the drone although it
looks like it's right in the center and
you don't want to affect your battery
life is
the performance of it there's your HD
camera you want to be careful with that
guy and these this design looks very
very similar to drone v1 other than a
couple changes in component and in the
components that are being used so you
got your same gears and shafts the same
propeller blades by the look of things
very flexible which will save your bacon
at some point I guarantee it
when you accidentally fly it up against
the tree and it bends like this instead
of snapping off like I've seen many
other less intelligently designed RC
aircraft to do on the bottom here yeah
there's pretty much nothing nothing out
of the ordinary sigani camera as well as
your ultrasound and I think that pretty
much covers it thank you for checking
