cube case is great for air cooling or
liquid cooling check the link in the
video description to learn more now we
were inspired by tiny Tom Logan's so you
can check out his youtube channel
time-to-live customs Oh tiny Tom Logan's
review of the Maxima six a stream from a
soos and the reason we were inspired by
it was because he had the Pushpa or
whatever the word is for it to basically
come out and say yes this is a fully
featured board and it has all the bells
and whistles but who gives two shakes of
a lamb's tail because it doesn't
actually affect performance in a way
that reflects the extra money you spent
on it so we actually were inundated with
requests to take tiny Tom Logan's
conclusion that's something like an
extreme grade board or extreme grade
board is not necessarily a great value
for the money and put it into practical
terms where we actually test it so we
took the Maxima six extreme which is a
z87 motherboard designed for hardcore
tuning and tweaking liquid nitrogen
overclocking it comes with the OC panel
which allows you to make Hardware
adjustments to pretty much anything you
want without even going into the BIOS
very very high grade board and we took
the least expensive z87 mini ITX
motherboard that we could find which was
the gigabyte z87 n Wi-Fi and we put them
head-to-head we were able to achieve the
same overclock on both of them because
neither slick nor I are really extreme
overclockers to the point where we're
playing around with tertiary memory sub
timings nothing like that that's where
you're going to squeeze a little bit of
extra performance out of an extreme
grade board so we've got the same
overclock of 4.7 gigahertz on both of
these platforms actually I'm going to
take you right over here for a minute
we're going to have a look at the test
platform so you can see that we were
running our vertex loser vertex fours
right yep we were running our vertex for
test drives
we were running a 4770k a GTX 780 as
well as of course our H 100 cooler of
course our ax 850 power supply and that
is pretty much it we only ran a couple
games and we're looking at
this from a gaming perspective although
it should be noted that slight
differences in gaming performance will
also reflect slight differences in other
performance because the only variable we
changed was the motherboard that was it
so performance wise I'm going to Chuck a
couple of graphs up here so you guys can
have a look at these and that should
give you some idea of about what you can
expect so it's anywhere from around 2 to
5 percent from going from sort of the
most bare-bones board that we could all
the way to the most extreme board that
we could and the thing about this is
that I don't want this to be sort of
discouraging if you really want a
high-end board there are still benefits
so for example high-end boards such as
Maximus 6 formula in particular I think
is a great example of a high-end board
that delivers compelling value it has
much better onboard audio than most of
the other boards out there on the market
it has a better land solution than a non
gaming oriented board something like
color scheme is very important to many
gamers many tweakers many system
builders who are really into the looks
of their machines and you do get all
those things with a high grade board
that you don't get with an entry-level
board I don't know where this board is I
think slick told me it was here
somewhere but I don't know where it
disappeared to however don't expect to
get some kind of crazy performance
benefit from going with a higher-end
motherboard another example of where
you'll get a benefit with the Maximus 6
extreme is obviously expansion so this
particular board only has about 4 SATA
ports it's got a single PCI Express 16x
slot with the Maximus 6 for extreme I
think I said formula before whatever the
extreme you get four-way cross wire
cross wire my wires got crossed 4-way
crossfire 4 Way SLI you get all of that
stuff that most people will probably
never do but if you're one of those
people who really feels like they need
the option for that stuff I personally
don't because I will never go for way
crossfire or four-way SLI in fact I
don't recommend it at all
so if you're one of those people who
feels like they need that then you have
the option as well thank you slick for
fixing my upside-down yank at which was
hopefully serving to spice things up in
the background a little bit if you
weren't fascinated by the content so in
conclude
fusion guys does buying a gaming
motherboard actually yield higher fps in
many cases no you have to look at it in
terms of does the value proposition of
that higher end board make sense for you
or is it something you don't really care
about thank you for checking out this
whatever this was on - tech tips click
like on the video if you liked it click
dislike if you disliked it click comment
if you feel the need to express some
other kind of sentiment about the video
so for example if you are completely
disappointed that this nyan cat does not
in fact have a rainbow tail which I was
disappointed to discover when it arrived
then let us know that too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
