brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so here it is guys AMD
freesync a year late and a dollar short
and well though that's not necessarily a
bad thing it did take a year compared to
in videos do you think and it's a lot
more than a dollar short the main
benefit that AMD is touting for free
sync is that first four letters the
whole free thing so as long as you have
an AMD GPU and as long as the monitor
has a scaler with a firmware that
supports free sync there is no
additional cost compared to any other
high-end monitor that has a decent
scaler in it that also has a variable
refresh rate panel so compared to gsync
which actually has an over $100 module
cost that goes along with the monitor
freesync doesn't cost extra it actually
comes with a couple of other benefits
that they're talking about as well while
free sync variable refresh rate
technology is not supported on HDMI or
DVI or any of those more traditional
inputs the monitor can at least support
them without free sync you will need to
run DisplayPort for free sync to
function now if this sounds very sort of
you know too good to be true actually it
gets even better
so unlike g-sync AMD is launching
they're going to have sometime in the
next quarter or so 12 monitors already
with free sync and I kind of went well
how did you get so many wengie sync is
still struggling to get a ton of support
and the answer is well because it
doesn't actually cost the monitor
vendors anything extra and gives them an
additional value add and you might go
cable what's the value add what exactly
is this free sync from AMD G sync from
Nvidia thing and the answer is it's
variable refresh rate technology so when
your GPU is outputting add exactly 144
frames per second so this is a 27-inch
144 Hertz monitor if your GPU could
output at exactly 144 frames per second
exactly evenly and smoothly all the time
then you would never experience what's
called tearing if the frame rate goes
too high or too low you can experience a
phenomenon called tearing where it's
actually showing part of the you know
the last frame that was rendered up here
and part of the next frame down here and
they can be kind of separated from each
other and particularly when
fast this can be very visually
distracting especially in certain games
so freesync totally eliminates that by
allowing the monitor to refresh every
time the GPU outputs a frame to it now
it's not perfect and something that you
might even be able to see right now is
that depending on the implementation
from the monitor vendors you will see
either free sync disabled at somewhere
in the range of maybe 40 Hertz or
somewhere in the range of maybe you know
30 Hertz where it actually if the game
framerate drops below that range free
sync will actually disabled you will see
a little bit of tearing but this is not
an inherent limitation of free sync this
is a limitation of the panel technology
once you start to refresh them extremely
slowly you're going to get flickering
rather than tearing and that can be even
less desirable especially if you dip
below that quite frequently it'll be
very distracting to your eyes so free
sync actually supports refresh rates as
low as nine Hertz but we're not going to
see anything like that today so you kind
of go okay there's 12 monitors or
something like that they're promising up
to 20 by the end of the year but what
kind of monitors are we getting are we
getting a bunch of 1080p TN panels no
actually AMD has a cross-section of
different monitors right here in their
booth so this is the BenQ XL 27 30 Z I'm
try and get all these model names right
this is a 27-inch 2560 by 1600 TN panel
and it runs at 144 Hertz I was getting
the look is he going to miss the refresh
rate that's really important because
this is going to this looks like it's
going to be a great competitor for
something like the Asaro G Swift this
one right here is the samsung u e5 9d I
sure hope that's right yeah it is
28 inch 4k 60 Hertz and this one is not
a TN panel this is actually a V a type
panel they've actually got their demo
running here where you can much like
we've already seen within videos
pendulum demo you can switch between no
I don't know 45 fps and 60 fps and you
can do sweeping fps it can change all
the time you can actually see very
visually if I turn freesync off whoa
that's ugly and this is not a faked demo
you've probably seen this especially
games like Skyrim man that game tears
like a bitch this one right over here
here is the LG this is the 29 um 67 yeah
nailed it so that's a 2560 by 1080 IPS
monitor we've actually reviewed its
little non free sync enabled brother I'm
personally a huge fan of the whole ultra
wide thing but not a big fan of ten ten
thousand eighty vertical pixels but
don't worry LG is actually showing off
hopefully we're going to be checking
that out tomorrow in their booth the 34
inch 34 40 by 1440 version of this
monitor that is also 60 Hertz also free
sync enabled so it is an extremely
exciting time for at least the folks at
AMD who want people buying AMD graphics
cards and having that that variable
refresh rate feature that is the kind of
thing that's hard to sell to people
because unless they've seen it before
it's hard to understand why you would
even care about something that you've
been putting up with for the last five
10 or 20 years or however long you've
been a gamer putting up with tearing so
I think that pretty much wraps it up
that is definitely the most exciting
thing here at the AMD booth guys don't
miss any of our CES coverage click that
subscribe button so you don't miss any
of it and I do want to take a moment to
thank our sponsors phantom glass these
guys make the best iron screen
protectors on the market they're super
clear they feel just like the glass
that's on your phone and there's no
great secret to that it's because it's
actually made of Gorilla Glass they've
got a nano coating on the bottom that
allows it to be applied with absolutely
no bubbles effortlessly and makes it
reusable so if you've got to RMA your
phone you can actually take it off wrap
it onto something get your phone back
reapply it and you are ready to rock as
well as oh yeah do you want to check out
store dot phantom dog class we've got
that linked in the video description you
want to check that out they've got
covers for lots of different phones as
well as HyperX they're also sponsoring
our trip to the show here you're going
to wanna check out youtube.com slash
HyperX for all the great gaming content
that they've got going on that's also
linked in the video description thanks
for watching guys and we'll see you at
our next CES 2015 video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
