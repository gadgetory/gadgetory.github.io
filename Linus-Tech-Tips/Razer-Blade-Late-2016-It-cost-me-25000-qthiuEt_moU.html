blade late 2016 since launch in fact I
bought a dozen of the first ones off the
production line back in October so I
could box them up and give them out at
my staff Christmas party so why then did
it take me so long to do this review
because I was waiting for a very special
blade a one-of-a-kind signed LTT edition
blade that will soon be in the hands of
a very lucky winner who graciously
agreed to let me show case his beautiful
prize in my review before sending it
along so here we go tunnel bear is the
simple VPN app that makes it easy to
browse privately and enjoy a more open
Internet to Tritonal bear for free check
out the link in the video description
the unboxing experience really hasn't
changed a lot since the original razor
blade 14 you get a laptop razors
characteristically compact 165 watt
power adapter and some papers to
accidentally throw away before you
remember about the earth and in fact not
much has changed outwardly about the
machine either aside from the textured
LPT design by IDI which you won't find
on the one that you buy at the store
anyway it still rocks a normal
non-magnetized power cord to make
hint-hint razor to go with its three USB
3 ports audio jack thunderbolt 3 port
and hdmi port and like it basically
looks like the same damn computer still
with the black still with the rubber
feet still with the dime thickness and
still with the bright green razer logo
on the back that causes gamers to rush
the stands and professionals to refuse
to go into meetings with their laptops
because they're too embarrassed even
most of the key specs are the same CPU
same Ram same battery same though the
maximum nvm ESS
sighs got doubled to one terabyte and
the gtx 970m from last gen has been
bumped to a GTX 1060 which means the
newest blade is a very capable little VR
machine and that both the Thunderbolt
and HDMI port can handle 4k 60 Hertz now
not that a 10 60 will run most games at
4k 60 frames per second anyway which is
where my favorite difference from the
last gen comes in the blade is now
available with a glass-top 3200 by 1800
touch screen or a matte 1920 by 1080
non-touchscreen
that's cheaper saves a little battery
avoids any issues with poor resolution
scaling and windows and translates to up
to double the framerate in games now
obviously you can turn down the touch
screen model to 1080p but then you're
dealing with interpolation instead of a
crisp native resolution image and for me
personally the difference in sharpness
has a much much smaller impact on my
gaming experience than the massive
difference in frame rates that make
animations on the 1080p late 2016 2 to 3
times faster than other blades
I mean sure a razor core upgrade would
boost performance as well but that
thing's like 500 bucks plus a video card
so it got some upgrades but many of the
complaints from previous blades do still
exist they run hot interestingly the
higher frame rates of the 1080p model
puts more strain on the CPU while gaming
they are loud when you're pushing them
hard and the input lag on the mere 60
Hertz display with no G sync is far from
the best I've seen on what is
purportedly a gaming notebook with that
said the webcam is still pretty good
even if it hasn't improved much if at
all the trackpad took a major leap
forward in responsiveness and
acceleration curve tuning in both 2016
models and the keyboard thankfully bears
no resemblance whatsoever to the one in
the higher-end blade
Pro it's one of my favorite laptop
keyboards ever in spite of the lack of
illumination of the secondary functions
a downgrade from the 2015 model that
seems to have been born from a desire
for RGB backlighting and one that
bothers me pretty much every day so on
the surface then not a lot has changed
even going back a few generations but
when you look closely er razor has been
absolutely refining the experience with
the improvement to surface temperatures
of the device during use being one of
the most noticeable day-to-day and while
the blade has been good enough for a
while for me to use as a work first game
second kind of person it wasn't until
this generation that it was good enough
for me to spend real money on it
dropping over 25,000 US dollars on these
machines for my entire staff so in spite
of the very small improvements do I
think the blade late 2016 is the best
blade yet you're damn right I do let's
just hope that they don't trash the 2017
model by putting that awful keyboard
from the blade pro on it or the next
time my employees get new computers they
might be from Appy
