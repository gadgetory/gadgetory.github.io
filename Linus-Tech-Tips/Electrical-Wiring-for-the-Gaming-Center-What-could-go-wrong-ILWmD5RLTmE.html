since we showed off the first prototype
of what will be the systems in the LMG
Land gaming Center we have been hard at
work in the background on the ultimate
employee lounge and it is going to be
freaking awesome key word being going to
be first we have a lot of repetitive ass
work to do wiring up this place for
electricity and networking but there's a
plus side I brought back Brian to help
hey guys remember the guy from the lake
a local electric car charger video with
all the good jokes which grabs your line
they are actually slightly shorter but
not in a way that matters it's not as
thick either - well they were jokes
anyway they were something like this you
know what's no joke though our sponsor
for this video origin PC builds custom
desktops and high-performance laptops
with free lifetime 24/7 tech support and
they only use high end components like
Samsung's 970 Evo Pro m2 SSD visit
Origin PC today at the link below for a
special promo
okay so um why don't we do a haul video
here
sure like is that is that a thing that
they do in the electrician business so
this here is our bit oh no I gotta hold
it this is our big old pool of
electrical wiring what's this cult it's
14 three loom X 14 3 loom X is that like
the good
it's the adequate it's what you use for
wood frame it's what you use for wood
frame get come on in closer pellet come
on check check this check this stuff out
long story short hour so you told them
cat6a right yes because all of our
gaming systems are gonna be 10 gig
because we can and brian says he
specifically told the supplier cat6a and
they delivered cat 5e we called them
were like hey yo we need cat 6a they're
like yo we don't have any of that good
luck and we called a few other places
nobody has it really like it's crazy
well I remember to back when we ordered
this spool yeah we had to get it from
the states we had to special-order it
but the good news is even though we
didn't get the right wiring we found
this spool of cat6a so it's a nightmare
to work with but that's okay because
we're terminating into Keystone jacks
this time so it should be a complete
non-issue and I found all the old runs
from the old office that we used to have
up in carabiners screwed into the
ceiling running from like the bottom
floor up to the top floor finally
speaker wire so we're gonna wire the
whole place up for sound not necessarily
really knowing exactly what we're gonna
install and when we would do it oh yeah
right
workflow stuff electrical boxes these
are a couple links for the conduit yeah
and then these are snap in connectors
bunch of light switches and whatnot a
bunch of terminations for our networking
plugs plugs and then we got this what is
this that is just a really big junction
box will run a conduit or two out of the
panel yeah we'll run the conduit to this
box yeah up on the wall and then from
here we'll break out to all the plugs
and the lighting in the room okay so
basically the deal today
I'm you're like totally untrained
apprentice I'm your assistant so
whatever it is that we're gonna do I'm
gonna do some of it too sure so why
don't we start with mounting boxes sure
I noticed you brought a lot of drills
you know we have drills here yes but I
like using my drills right but you can't
use for drills well they all have a
different purpose
this is quarterly so there's no
batteries to kill for one this is a
regular drill yeah and then the other
two are impacts okay this is
compensating so why don't we grab that
giant box of goodies okay that's my job
right I got it sure
okay I'm gonna put it over here
following instructions sir yes sir
how about I move the ladder is that an
apprentice job sir the ladder has been
relocated sir right so what do I need
from this box to a game box you're
getting box single game box
single game box yeah these holes are
gangs then essentially also how many
devices you can not it yep then we just
need screws is this kind of like PC
building where you just don't bother
with all eight of them they're like yeah
if you used a leap that is hugely
overkill so this is kind of eyeballed
anyway hey yeah battery battery brings
all the drills brings no batteries so
basically Brian's the kind of guy that's
got the tool but none of the stamina no
no I just have a day job that I use
those oh yeah you heard me Brian okay
that seems solid enough I'm out to the
box oh no we need a data ring oh wow it
comes with screws already in it they
should all be like this that's amazing
if it are they Robertson or Phillips lil
Philips nah buddy
of course Wow okay cool so that's done
what now now we drill holes and pull
wire that sounds really fun I don't know
if I should trust you with this but yeah
where do I put the hole so we're gonna
need one over here
and one over here and then same bar back
there yes yes same up there all the way
up to the top right you good otherwise
look ah my eyes I'll be back this is a
really dull drill bit Brian oh wow
that's really okay I drilled one hole
Wow okay I will need the tallest ladder
because I have the verdict legs look you
don't get to tease me about it when I'm
already owning it that's the rules oh
I'm fine you think we don't have a lot
of things to work with yeah thank you
yeah who's the assistant now but this
bit is zero out of ten better I actually
wonder if we have sharper Spade bits
how's 5/8 cent fine okay now now we pull
wire pull where tell ya these are gonna
come across yeah and get stapled but you
see there's blocking so we have to go up
off the blocking mm-hmm oh you haven't
showed your innovative little spool
holder here brilliant what well I mean
it works I don't think you're supposed
to stand on that one so then I just go
over this do dog yeah and pull enough
that it doesn't fall yeah
as expected this is truly very tedious
yeah I'm having fun so far though that's
good
I'm electrician Eve it's like a dull
ting but with electricity and you want
to leave a fair bit in the box yeah like
how much like that yep that's fine and
no we staple okay this looks more like a
staple remover than a stapler you're
just gonna whack it with it aren't you
yeah that's stupid why don't you use a
hammer for that
because I can do many things yeah the
thing is that not everyone's arms are
that big I'm pretty sure your forearms
are bigger than my biceps and then you
want a staple what like every three or
four feet or like shut up shut up so
there's a little bit of wiggle and
that's okay yeah I could really use a
hammer well now that it's stapled all
the way up you need to staple it all the
way across all right I'm getting a
hammer I figured out why you gave me
pliers you don't have a hammer
what kind of man doesn't have a hammer
in his toolkit I'm pretty sure they take
the way your man card if you don't have
a hammer
how's that hammer working for you like
this better than the pliers would be on
so much so then what I just need to put
some pulls here here here in here in
here yeah we're actually gonna need a
few holes through that top plate so I
should just put like a bunch of holes in
it yeah pretty much
oh that's less good oh yeah okay I need
to cover that I blame Jake for those
wondering this is where six workstations
one cpu ended up it's folding right now
but we're gonna have to put that on
pause aren't you not supposed to do that
Linus do I reach way off a ladder what's
more dangerous okay so is that fine yes
you hesitated okay so what do I do now
you could drag cat6 over for that data
jack oh my god shouldn't I have done
that at the same time yes or no because
it still needs to all be stapled
separately right but all the latter
movements I suggested pulling it earlier
Oh Brian you're supposed to save me from
myself here so let's see if this is
gonna work here sir is there anything
else I could be doing while I move this
ladder here like Jake has marked X's on
the floor lower all the boxes go
okay how do I mount a octagon box enter
the Octagon same way that we want the
other box is this an octagon box yes it
is that's because this is
clearly a circle with two flattened
sides I got this don't worry about it
I'm not gonna fall oh and that's why you
don't leave things on the top of the
ladder speaking of dropping there's also
a certain expected minimum level of
common sense as well is there is there
on the jobsite brian is there I didn't
do the Octagon box I didn't do the
optical I'll do a LAN stapling believe
it are there any particular rules with
respect to staples for data keep the
distance about the same for neatness
more than anything the only real major
things are you can't run it through the
same hole as a power lead because
they're differing voltages okay and the
other thing too being data yeah you
don't want AC power anywhere near it
yeah you get interference makes sense
that's why we're running down separate
studs for these I guess so I've got two
Ethernet runs done now one for the
access point that's gonna be up in the
ceiling so it is starting to come
together key word being starting because
there is a lot of work to do still
you're in Canada this is the bond
it's either bare or it's green there's
actually a screw at the back of the
enclosure so we can take that wrap it
around that screw snug it down and now
this is bonded oh so all the Europeans
were concerns that we just don't care
about safety basic that nothing was
earth yeah yeah we are in Canada we have
lots of Earth probably more than you
unless you're in Russia do you want to
actually install the plug let's find out
if I know how to do this
so there's your strippers yeah rivers
are on the floor I didn't know you were
bringing strippers to this whole party
here so I should probably hold on I know
and
I'm gonna do the I'm gonna do the find
tell me I make a point of not using the
quick-connect fine I'll use the other
one the reason being I've actually seen
those connections melted and the
insulation on the wire melted a ways
back all right so we're gonna do our
green one yeah so that's our earth wire
bond yeah Wow I suck at this how I poked
myself who knew installing a plug would
be so painful
well one outlet done what about the
cover plate we'll do that later
see this is teenagers today they come in
to like help and literally sit on the
floor and also rather than clear eight
things off of a chair they sit on the
floor how do these power these people
gonna find employment all right
let's terminate some ethernet I've only
done this once other than that every
single other time I've terminated to a
jack for these though yes you don't have
to remember it's right on there that's a
cool stripper so I'm check this out
we've got this like Gigantor separator
on the inside and how much damn distance
with terminations yeah for the
specification you're actually only
supposed to have about a half inch of
wire untwisted total really yes
that's it that's it okay I did not know
that it was so little so you literally
want to keep these nested pairs right
the whole damage exactly so I just hold
it there just kind of Bend and untwist
it to that point yeah then it's twisted
literally right to where you're gonna
punch it down beauty so that's it this
is terminated and then okay there's a
little doodad that goes on and that's it
beautiful right now just imagine the
entire place with all of the wiring them
so we fast forward it a little bit and a
lot has actually changed so Brian has
finished up the vast majority of the
wiring now including electrical ethernet
speaker wiring so we could go surround
sound in here in the future if we wanted
to
see and we've actually got some painting
done so the rafters are now black that's
a black stain it's gonna look homey it's
gonna look cozy all that's left now is
to make sure that any of this actually
works so we need a patch cord
conveniently there's one on the floor
sitting right there yeah that'll do it
wait are we gonna need another switch
well boss hook up are these labeled
labeled one is the arcade to I think is
the counter three is the far corner well
why don't we go try and we still have
some left that one is damaged halfway
through Oh
oh wow that's very damaged look at that
okay do you want to go try number four
and then I'm gonna go double-check in
the server room that we actually are
plugged into this well try swapping it
back to war you're into four oh let's
see some internet browsing there it is
oh I'm not allowed to watch that video
no okay but let's make sure power works
so four is the TV yeah so 5 will be the
wireless access point got it so if you
hear the beeping the plugs over there or
uh no oh oh nice so that's it we've got
power
we've got Ethernet and we've got well
