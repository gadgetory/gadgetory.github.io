a very unique notebook design now you
can see that instead of going with a
more traditional LCD display we've gone
with a dog's face for the leapfrog sky
no I'm just kidding we have an actual
notebook to check out this is the
gigabyte u 2 4 4 2 and there is a rhyme
and reason behind that naming scheme but
it's probably more complicated than is
worth going into this is a thin and
light notebook that is aimed at sort of
your your travelling professional that
still wants decent performance because
rather than using an ultra-low voltage
chip gigabyte has opted for a an SV chip
so the actual one here can go up to 3.2
gigahertz is the 30 to 30 M they've got
a 14 inch 1600 by 900 display and a
little bit of graphics horsepower to
actually go behind it so it uses a GT
730 instead of the what did--what would
normally be used with a thin and light
notebook which is the Intel onboard
graphics in terms of accessories we've
got a little gigabyte carrying case
which is sort of a fake leather material
and that it has two velcro pieces here
as well as kind of a microfiber inside
there's also a thing of do not eat
inside so you can go ahead and put your
notebook in there in order to carry it
around it also comes with a pretty
standard looking power brick so here's
my traditional phone size comparison
there's an HTC one next to it normally
I'd expect to be a bit of a smaller
power brick for a thin light but part of
that could be the fact that gigabytes
gone with a higher performance CPU as
well as a GPU the utility driver disk
you probably won't need because they've
implemented a pretty cool functionality
that allows you to access the BIOS as
well as recovery options for the
notebook simply by pressing a particular
hotkey when you're in there they include
a they include our cleaning cloth so
rather than including a throwaway piece
of paper inside here they include what's
actually a fairly nice screen cleaning
cloth that said that's a nice touch
anyway so there's a there's one of the
function keys we'll be able to access
that through the BIOS which is kind of
cool
so there we go 14 inch LED backlit
screen nice and thin let's do some more
phone size comparisons just so that you
guys have some idea what
talking about they've got made in Taiwan
branding all over it those of you who
didn't know that gigabyte makes
notebooks this is kind of relatively new
to North America but they have been
doing them for a while they've got what
actually is kind of a nice finish on the
top here so it's a it's a brushed metal
finish that is in kind of a champagne
color up here with just simple branding
I mean it's it's one thing for people
who really want a notebook that's like
flashy and all that but for me
personally I like something that's just
a little bit more plain looking it's not
super super thin but it's also not thick
by any stretch of the imagination so
here we'll do our usual size comparison
here there we go in terms of i/o on the
side this is again part of the reason
why you might might might not be as thin
so it's performance parts inside so
you've got a Kensington lock headphone
microphone jack two USB 2.0 ports VGA
out this is handy especially if you're
traveling on business Gigabit Ethernet
so there you go see I mean it has things
like an Ethernet port I still like to
have an Ethernet port that still does
mean something to me and if that means
it has to be a little bit thicker than I
found myself quite a few times with my
aspire s7 that I've been using lately
wishing it had an Ethernet port whenever
I have problems with wireless
connectivity or whatever else this is a
little bit unique for our notebook of
this form factor as well you've got dual
exhaust vents at the back and this is
again likely because they've added more
GPU horsepower than you'd normally have
on a notebook like this with that said
if you're not actually using the GPU it
shouldn't have too much of an adverse
effect on the battery life because it
does support in videos optimist
technology which is GPU switching so
it'll use the onboard graphics whenever
it doesn't need the additional
horsepower and it'll use the dedicated
graphics whatever it does on this side
you've got your power in as well as HDMI
USB 3 and an SD card slot and then we
also find out look at that it booted
right up so I guess this is they
actually have this ready to go as as a
demo unit so let's find out what all the
stuff does I'm sort of curious that it
has a textured touchpad which actually
has a very very different feel to it
it's a little bit cool to the touch as
well this isn't what I'm
we used to touch pads being made out of
it's kind of nice so let's go to the
desktop
I believe they include hi yes so this is
kind of a funny thing now I've seen a
lot of manufacturers approach this in
different ways
customers are confused about how to
power down a Windows 8 machine because
it used to be just let Start menu turn
off whereas now you have to get to the
charms menu which is hovering over the
top right corner look been going to
settings carefully without accidentally
going outside of the charms menu then
going to power
so what gigabytes so I've seen I've seen
Dania factures include little slips of
paper that explained how to turn off the
computer but this is sort of a unique
approach there's a little power icon
down there and they have included a
stock taskbar thing that allows you to
restart sleep hibernate shut down or
shut down in fastboot mode very very
very cool well one thing's for sure it's
getting the seal of approval from my cat
who is who is snuggling the notebook
pretty good here there's not too much in
terms of bloatware I mean you've got you
know Nvidia graphics drivers physics
drivers they've got a couple management
tools but no sort of annoying like hey
buy this buy this buy this you know
antivirus is like overly aggressive anti
viruses or anything like that so I mean
quite frankly with Microsoft Security
Essentials and and a lot of the free
options out there I can't imagine a good
reason to buy antivirus these days and
I'm sure someone's gonna come out and
tell me I'm wrong but there you go
support manager that's cool so you press
this button and you can change your
volume settings brightness power mode
let's see what kind of power modes we
got here so custom power saver balance
high performance okay so there's a
standard thing so they've just made a
little skin for it switching between
monitors things like that it's nice to
have a little dedicated button for it
though and it closes if you press it
again this is kind of neat so I'm
actually gonna power the notebook down
and okay okay no well we'll finish we'll
finish with the actual notebook first so
the keyboard is LED backlit it's a
chiclet keyboard and what it does is it
actually dynamically adjusts its
brightness according to the environment
so it's obviously not on right now
because we're filming a video so we
actually needed some light function keys
are able to put it into sleep turn your
wireless on and off brightness up and
down switch to an external display
more of a volume control as well as
enabling bluetooth turning on the webcam
cool stuff like that
this is kind of oh right configuration
so it uses a double antenna Wi-Fi which
gigabytes claiming is able to achieve up
to double the performance what I'm
assuming is that they've implemented a
concurrent dual band Wi-Fi solution
which actually will improve performance
dramatically so that's that's another
that the thing that's kind of cool to
see implemented people of cool things we
did figure out how to force on the LED
backlight so you can see how bright it
is it's actually the quite bright looks
like the keys are individually lit and I
did determine that although this
particular one that I'm holding here
doesn't have a two-and-a-half inch hard
drive in it the the shell itself
supports up to an M SATA SSD and an
additional two and a half inch drive so
you could add a hybrid drive or well an
additional storage hard drive this one I
already mentioned the 30 to 30 M
processor as well as the 1600 by 900 LCD
it's got eight gigs of ddr3 RAM I 128
gig M SATA SSD in this particular one
two gigs of memory on that GT 730 m l2 I
doubt that the extra memory will benefit
you in any tangible way and then it
supports 802.11 b/g/n as well as
Bluetooth with a 4.0
so that's your Wireless and all that
good stuff it supports on/off charging
which means that even when the notebook
is powered down you can charge devices
off of it which is just kind of handy
it's one of those things that desktops
have been doing for a long time but
hasn't necessarily been implemented on
all notebooks and we're gonna go ahead
and use this little thing I actually
kind of like that it's neat little
widget they should make it available
like the gigabyte shut down widget to
anyone this is kind of cool
so all these indicator LEDs over here
Bluetooth Wi-Fi hard drive charging
brightness let's check this out so see
that little battery icon there if you
right-click while the computers off haha
it's a battery indicator so I checked in
Windows and it's got about 60% battery
so you can quickly check and see oh look
at that it has just over half battery
yay even when the notebooks off you can
you can know how much battery life is
left in your notebook overall
construction is fairly plasticky the top
feels nice but I wish that it had an
equal sort of fit and finish to the
bottom which is which is a plastic shell
that does have a little bit of a little
bit of flex
you've got easy access to memory
upgrades which is nice but I wish that
you had easier access to the tune of
half inch drive Bay I can see through
these flats that that you don't it looks
like you'll have to remove the whole
bottom of the notebook with that being
said what is good about an approach like
this is that simply by removing these
screws you have access to the entire
bottom of the notebook so if you didn't
want to do anything with it such as
change the drives whether it's the M
SATA Drive or the hard drive itself then
that would be fairly doable for you
there's an included webcam up here and
other than that I don't think that we
have missed anything thank you for
