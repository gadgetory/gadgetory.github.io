making it really quick here it's like
2:00 in the morning
really would like to sleep but whatever
number one is huge thanks to everyone
out there for making this possible
because obviously if nobody's subscribed
to my videos then I wouldn't have any
subscribers so that wouldn't be possible
it's very exciting very cool it's been a
long time coming so my join date is 24th
of November 2008 so it's taken quite a
long time to get there but yeah it was
very cool is very neat to see that
number turnover number two here's my
video card box with a tablet stand in it
of all things but that way I got my 6990
you got my GTX 590 585 75 60 460 got a
69 70 69 50 downstairs got a 68 77 lots
of graphics cards here I also have my
Intel Core i7 2600
actually in here there's 2500 kale in
there right now so I'm gonna put my
water cooling back on put my 2600 K back
in there so I've got that and then I've
also got a bulldozer fx-8150 and I'm
gonna be doing some comparative testing
on the GPU side as well as on the CPU
side with drumroll whoops press the
button battlefield 3 yes so it is coming
and I also want to one last thing I
wanted to add in this video origin so
far I'm pretty impressed average
download speeds that blows away almost
anything that I've gotten from Steam on
any kind of half decently new game that
it's a pretty incredible it's in beta
right now I've yet to see if I can do
drag and drop installs with battlefield
3 which is going to make me love it a
whole lot more but so far we are off to
a good start so thank you guys once more
for making the 100,000 subscriber thing
possible very very exciting for me and
stay tuned for battlefield 3 action
don't forget to subscribe if you're not
already subscribed but if you are thanks
that's the summary</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
