it's holiday PC buyer's guide time again
as usual we'll be targeting three
different price points in US dollars
before operating system under five
hundred dollars nine hundred to a
thousand ish and about two thousand
dollars I'll be using pricing from
Newegg u.s. and amazon.com and I'll have
a where to buy link in the video
description let's go G fuel is having a
buy one get one free deal event this
Black Friday on there forty serving tubs
check it out now at the link in the
video description so first up is our
decent quality 1080p gaming box we won't
be sweating small stuff like
upgradability or future-proof Ness
or this one we've got five hundred bucks
to spend so if it doesn't make the FPS
number go up it's out so there are a
hundred and forty five CPUs on
newegg.com from fifty to seventy-five
dollars
too bad that when you filter out the
dual cores you're left with a whopping
one option at the price we paid last
year the athlon x4 845 non overclockable
and slower than the 860 k we chose last
year that goes for $78 now I mean if I'm
going to spend that much I might as well
go with the no no no there's nothing
bloody hell is it a bad time to be a
budget cpu buyer but at least I get
AMD's Wraith stock cooler for my extra
eight dollars right oh wait I don't that
part number costs an extra twenty
dollars on top so 860 K with a normal
cooler and paying more for it it is
anyway shopping for RAM is easy I opted
for a single stick trading a little bit
of performance for the option to upgrade
to 16 gigs down the road and last year
for the motherboard I went with a super
basic MSI board for forty seven dollars
cheap right
this year asus has
one for 40 bucks sold moving on to the
case after two years of dominance the
cooler Master Elite 350 has finally been
dethroned in my $500 system by
Coolermaster the elite 342 drops
compatibility with full ATX motherboards
and you get a 400 watt instead of a 500
watt power supply but just save a few
bucks and from Hardware secretss review
the included 400 watt unit made by FSP
can actually deliver its rated output as
long as you're not concerned with
efficiency and I will definitely be
using that six dollars I saved to get a
ball and out video card the Radeon rx
484 gig has double the frame buffer but
more importantly is way faster than the
GTX 960 2 gig that I recommended for
this system last year and it costs only
20 bucks more for the cheapest variant I
could find on Newegg with civilization 6
included to boot our storage is going to
be a lot faster - scrolling past some of
the very random cheap SSD options
Hyundai really reveals 240 gig products
from a handful of reputable brands for
as little as 65 bucks
we can always add a hard drive for more
storage later so I chose a SanDisk Z 410
so in summary we spent about 20 dollars
more than last year
for the same CPU and RAM loadout but we
are deep into double-digit gains when it
comes to GPU performance at 1080p and
ditching the mechanical hard drive will
make a huge difference to the day-to-day
usability even if it means we might need
a storage space upgrade in a little
while for our next system at $1000
future expandability features and
usability beyond gaming are much bigger
considerations but instead of spending
extra on chasing overclocking Headroom
I'll be focused on the best
out-of-the-box performance I can get so
we'll start with an Intel quad core and
this year for the same price we get a
big up
into a skylake core i5 6400 that wait a
minute this thing is only marginally
faster than the core i5 4460 we used
last time
I get it the i5 6500 is the sweet spot
this year much faster and only fifteen
dollars more oh and tell you devious
little scoundrels oh well at least for
our lunch money we also get a faster DM
I support for 64 gigs of DDR for RAM and
some power savings
speaking of RAM the best deals I found
while writing this we're on a vex
here.or Corsair 2 by 8 gig kits of ddr4
I didn't stress about speed for the
reasons I outlined in this video and I
picked the Asus be 150 m a MDOT to to
install them on no USB 3.1 support but
it's got four dimm slots for ram
expansion and with all the SSD
innovation moving forward on the MDOT 2
slot
I consider that a must-have for a
storage upgrade down the road the EVGA
b1 500 watt power supply held its crown
this year it's even a few bucks cheaper
and so is our case it was a toss-up for
me between the NZXT source 210 and the
thermal take versa h25 both at 40 bucks
but the Versa has free shipping with
prime so that put it over the top
storage got a big shake-up at this price
point this year SSDs are cheaper so I
got 750 gigs for what I paid for 500
gigs last year but I actually ditched
the 4 terabyte hard drive so you'll have
to add one later
if 750 gigs isn't enough for you
bringing us finally to the video card
the reason that I pinched every penny in
$1000 build up until this point I
managed to squeeze a gtx 1070 in here
making this rig a perfect match for a
cheap 1440p or even ultrawide monitor
off ebay or high-end vr gaming and I
even threw in a DVD
drive just to show off BAM so compared
to last year's model we spent marginally
less but we gained some CPU horsepower
go out a bigger SSD but sacrificed our
hard drive and we added anywhere from
forty to eighty percent to our gaming
performance depending on the game and
resolution not too bad for a year later
note that our Amazon build-out includes
an OEM CPU since even with a hyper t2
thrown in it's cheaper there and CPUs
rarely fail anyway our our last system
assumes a buyer who is willing to pay
more for creature comforts like sleeved
cables RGB lighting overclocking and
quiet operation it also assumes that a
buyer who requires high performance
outside of purely gaming applications
let's say video editing or 3d modeling
well it sure is easy to choose a CPU
when you have $2,000 to spend isn't it
actually no it kind of gets harder while
I could drop a thousand dollars on an
eight core sixty nine hundred Kay unless
I am heavy into content creation and
unlocked six core is going to do me just
fine and that money would be better
spent elsewhere so I'm going to go with
the 6800 Kay a slightly faster six core
than last year the 68 50k would be
strongly recommended as an upgrade if
you're adding a lot of PCI Express
storage or expansion cards along with
the same SLI support solid build quality
for overclocking and USB 3.1 the U dot 2
slot LED lighting and type C port on the
x99 a2 for an extra 15 bucks put it over
the top versus the older board we chose
last year then for RAM thanks to falling
prices we make up that 15 bucks and get
a slightly faster 32 gig kit a vengeance
lpx quad channel ddr4 then we did last
year plenty for the time being with the
option to upgrade to 64 gigs down the
road for case and cooling I went for a
slightly different strategy this year I
downgraded my case to an NZXT s340
which is basically as small as you
can get while still fitting my upgraded
cooling a knock to a 10 HD 14 compared
to last year it won't be as roomy to
work in but should yield a significant
improvement in CPU clock speeds for
overclocking power comes courtesy of an
EVGA supernova g2 850 watt fully modular
unit 80 plus gold a hundred watts more
than last year's our MX series and a few
bucks cheaper nice on to storage the
only real difference is that instead of
a bargain-basement one terabyte SSD and
a four terabyte hard drive we're getting
a Samsung 850 Evo one terabyte SSD and a
four terabyte hard drive I went with a
two and a half inch SSD even though it's
the same price as one that would go in
an m2 slot because in a tower case we
don't really need the space savings and
that will leave my MDOT two slots open
for an nvme drive upgrade in the future
right now that MDOT to drive unless you
want to pay a lot for it is going to be
running over the SATA interface anyway
also I checked a DVD drive in there
woohoo video card time last year I
actually downgraded the 3d gaming
performance of the $2,000 system to make
room for that six core CPU double the
memory and double the SSD storage
compared to the 2014 edition this year
I'll be able to keep all of those things
with the faster CPU and SSD better
cooling and better i/o and get better
gaming performance thanks to the GTX
1080 all of this while staying about $80
cheaper than the 2015 edition which
brings us then to the end of this year's
holiday buyer's guide remember as always
these aren't hard and fast rules and
daily pricing fluctuations especially on
categories like RAM or video cards can
affect the exact part that I would
recommend a lot but if you follow these
guidelines
I'm sure you'll end up with a kick-ass
system that you'll enjoy for years to
come interesting fact this is the first
year that all three systems come out
cheaper on Amazon than Newegg if you buy
Windows 10 and have prime for free
shipping so be sure to check out our
prime membership link below and the
links to where to by using our
code clicking through those links
regardless of what you buy
let's Amazon know that we helped you
with your purchasing decision which
gives us a commission I fix it they got
a lot of talking points nineteen
thousand free step-by-step repair guides
lots of tools you can buy on their site
lifetime warranty on the tools but I'm
going to get off the script for a little
bit here because I don't need to tell
you guys I fix its tool gets so great
and they allow you to take apart and
reassemble pretty much any device and
I'm gonna go what is it
late November ah yes full on holiday
messaging got a geek in your life who
doesn't have a tool kit yet BAM perfect
present I fix-it toolkit you'll actually
be giving them the gift of saving money
and tinkering Bluemoon and tinkering
with electronics what could possibly be
better I know a discount so also use our
discount code so you can save a few
bucks on your order and you can feel
good they can feel good I'll feel good I
fix it'll feel good everyone's feeling
good that's the Christmas spirit or
holiday spirit sorry so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
check out the link to where to buy the
stuff we featured at Amazon in the video
that I kind of already said that blob
whatever it's down there also linked in
the video description is our merch store
which has cool shirts like this one and
our community forum which you should
totally join now that you're done doing
all that stuff you're probably wondering
