brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys welcome to the
Kingston rapid-fire technology showcase
not a real thing but what I'm calling
this what we're gonna see first is 384
gigabytes of ddr4 ram working in a
server pretty awesome they didn't let me
take the top off completely but for
markings that we could find it is six
channel RAM which is an insane amount
when you look in here it's basically
just RAM which is awesome it's gonna be
nice that it's also running at one point
four volts or quite 2 volts my bad
because any amount of power savings in a
server configuration where you're in an
environment where you're probably in a
server room with a ton of these things
it's actually going to save a company a
very large amount of money because when
you're when you're multiplying how much
power you're saving it becomes a really
big deal next up we have something just
as or more beastly this is 24 400
gigabyte Kingston a 100 server great
SSDs in one system running all at the
same time on three raid tens running
through LSI controllers and then they
have 50 VMs running in the background
you would think maybe that they could
have more VMs and they could but no
because GPU power it has nothing to do
with limiting the speed of the SSDs and
we can actually see here on the right
side that there's quite a bit of
performance left in Headroom for the
SSDs but not necessarily for something
else and last but not least we have the
SSD showcase so first off they're
showing a client SSD which is powered by
an SF 3700 LSI Avago controller which is
pretty interesting but what's more
interesting is their PCI Express 4 X
card the predator which is also running
the same controller that controllers has
a potential of 1,800 megabytes per
second of potential throughput that's
pretty interesting down the line we have
a one terabyte SSD prototype which is
going to be more consumer and value
oriented saying one terabyte SSD
prototype and consumer and value
oriented is a little weird but it's
running a file on controller and I'm
pretty excited for that one as well
alright guys one last thing before we go
I want to give a shout out to Kingston
because they do sponsor a ton of eSports
stuff we are here live at d2l s4 and
this is pretty awesome and extremely
distracting the screen is right up there
so I'm gonna try to not look at it too
much while I'm running this video as
I'll be able to watch afterwards it
you are watching this video it's not
going to be live-streamed anymore look
online there might be an archive
somewhere I'm not actually a hundred
percent confirmed about that but yeah
Kingston is a huge sponsor of eSports so
if you are a big fan of eSports and
you're looking for some stuff that
Kingston makes maybe buy some Kingston
stuff thanks for watching our Kingston
content if you want to see all of our
CES 2014 content be sure to subscribe to
Linus tech tips and thank you to our
sponsors NCI xwd and Corsair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
