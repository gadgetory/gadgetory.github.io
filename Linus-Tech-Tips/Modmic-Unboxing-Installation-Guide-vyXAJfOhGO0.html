comm so why is Linus wearing a pair of
headphones right now how is this an
unboxing of a headset because these are
clearly headphones these are old
headphones these are not even like new
and interesting headphones because I
have something really cool to show you
guys this is vo he says good luck Linus
thanks Jimmy that's always a good sign
when the manufacturer says good luck I'm
just kidding I'm sure Tolga um so this
is the aunt Leon antlion mod mic wwm odd
mic calm designed and assembled in
Portland Oregon which is actually pretty
much neighbors from here the
instructions are actually right on the
outside of the tube so the packaging is
pretty simple it's a toilet paper roll
that has both of the ends bent it's not
quite a toilet paper roll it's a little
bit more rugged than that okay and I'm
just I'm just teasing Jimmy here okay
we're going to get serious now find a
flat spot on the headphones to place the
adhesive circle the pad will stick to
smooth and mesh surfaces just like this
one that you see right here okay put
your headphones on make sure the mod mic
will reach from the point of attachment
to within three inches behind the corner
of your mouth clean the surface with the
provided alcohol swab let dry and stick
it and then angle and location 30
seconds adhesive whatever okay let's
open this bad boy up so this is the way
to solve the problem that I personally
have had and that I think many people
have had where by and large the head the
the the headphones included on gaming
headsets are not necessarily the best
thing out there in terms of a high audio
quality gaming experience
now I switched from my from my HD 5 v 5s
that you see here to my SteelSeries 7
H's quite a while ago when I basically
just was like okay well I'm tired of
hanging a microphone around my neck I
will accept that the 7 HS might not be
quite up to the same standard as 5 v 5s
for the convenience of having an
integrated mic
now with this guy right here I no longer
have to compromise so here we go we've
got alcohol swab
which you use to apply the mod Mike
apparently there's apparently you're
gonna have to like Bend this thing
pretty good put your headphones on bend
the boom until the mic sits behind the
corner of your mouth so they do want you
to bend it there's not much in terms of
okay there you go that's pretty flexible
okay that's not bad that's uh that's not
not actually what I was what I was
expecting there all right you've got
here we go included magnetic pieces here
so you've got you can actually hook it
up to two different headphones so these
have magnets and adhesive strips on the
back so maybe what we'll do is we'll
actually go through the whole process
here I'll just melt the thing to my HD 5
v 5s and we'll call that an unboxing so
consider this a mod mic installation
guide which side does the microphone
usually go on this side right let's idea
okay so here we go so we're going to
take our mesh spot here we're going to
use our alcohol swab this is really
important because otherwise the adhesive
stands a really good chance of not
adhering correctly if there's any kind
of grease residue adhesives do not like
that we're going to go ahead and do that
then we're going to take one of these
two spots so you can see the magnetic
piece at clips on to there really nice
so we're going to take one of these two
and we're going to mount it kind of I
mean normally we'd try this before we
actually go ahead and stick it to it but
whatever so we're going to go with
you're not I'm going to at least try to
do this properly okay so we're going to
go with right a boat I'm going to test
that spot make sure it doesn't look
stupid yep so we're going to go with
that spot right there press on it for a
little bit here in fact they probably
have instructions for how long they want
you to press on it press it on for
thirty seconds so we you know we'll
finish pressing it on after okay then
the next thing you do is you take the
mod mike which has see a little cable
managed wire here so you can okay you
know what I'll show you that part later
so then you take the mod Mike and you
put it into this piece right here so
this one's screws there we go
and then can go in either this way or oh
yeah that goes in pretty tight right
there
okay so it goes in just like that sits
in there pretty good then you screw this
on okay I'll hold it into place and
voila hopefully this works because like
I said I haven't tested it at all
so you just make it so that this sits
right by the corner of your mouth here
you can adjust that the way that you
want and I don't think I got the angle
quite right but we can compensate for
that and there you go so it has a little
bow what I do
oh it's magnets right so it's basically
magic so there we go
so then what you do is you take the
little included cable organizer doodad
here you clip that to your existing
headphone cable if I had to criticize
something about the product so far I'd
say that it's a little bit small the
clip for the other cable but what I'll
what I would probably end up doing is
attaching them in a more permanent
fashion even using a piece of braided
sleeving and covering the entirety of
both of the wires together so that it's
pretty much one cord because the Mod mic
is interesting from a you know oh I can
detach it from my headphones perspective
but as a gamer I think most people are
going to be using it as more like a way
to attach a high-quality mic to a pair
of headphones pretty much
semi-permanently so the way that these
connect is actually by a screw in
connector so I have pretty good
confidence in the ruggedness of that
connection right there and I think
that's pretty much it so I'm really
excited to actually try this out guys I
wish I had taken a little bit more time
to get the angle right because the angle
that it comes out here is dependent on
the way that these home that's smart
look at that oh so you can either detach
it completely or you can actually put it
up like that just by using magnets
magnets are basically magic it's amazing
and like I've lost completely lost my
train of thought I just want to get this
I'll I'll get this about right before we
wrap up here and I'm having a little bit
of trouble doing that once you get it in
place I don't think it's going to move
because it's actually quite stiff so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the antlion mod Mike
don't forget to subscribe science tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computing videos and I'm really
glad they include two because my
original perception that it's so that
you can have two different headphones
you can use it with might have been
wrong maybe it's so that you can have a
do-over on the the setup process there
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
