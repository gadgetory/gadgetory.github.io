Zahle gear products as you can see I'm
in the camera man's office so I am
finally back at work after my boat with
the swine flu honestly I know nothing
about zowie as a company except that
they make gaming peripherals we don't
actually carry them yet however I'm
gonna have a look at these evaluation
products and check out what I think of
them so this headset is called the
hammer it should fall around like a
$69.99 $79.99 sort of price range it has
some guy on it who says it's really good
and then it has another guy who also
says it's really good okay so it's
designed for eSports so that means it's
designed for sports that you do not
leave your armchair in order to do the
very best kinds of sports obviously okay
so we'll start with the headset and they
also have a mousepad which is the GTF or
two-face
okay so headset here the build quality
actually there's nothing particularly
exceptional about it but it feels like
it's gonna be pretty comfortable when I
go ahead and put this on my head so I'm
just gonna figure out which way okay so
the arm here is a little bit stiff for
the huge huge microphone which looks
like it should be pretty good it's like
an enormous microphone in there I don't
know why you would need that but either
way that's pretty cool so this is the
left ear so I should probably be putting
the this turns all the way around okay
so I should probably put that over there
so I'm gonna check out the comfort level
here how do I look cameraman is making
kind of like a weird face at me this
isn't actually flexible which is
something I don't really like so you
can't adjust how far the mic sits away
from your head
however they're incredibly light which I
guess is one huge advantage of such a
such a slim design and another thing
that I've noticed about them asks I had
them on is that they are using a closed
design so that means that sound is gonna
be a little bit more tinny you're gonna
get a little bit less bass but the
advantage is going to be that
directionality is much better other
people can't hear what you're listening
to and you can't hear
any outside noises like I can hardly
hear myself talk when I have these on
much like the Sennheiser PC 350 s ok so
it also comes with what do we got here
oh okay we've got an on on the on the
cable we have switch for the mic as well
as a volume control this feels pretty
cheap and cheesy but I don't think the
clips want anywhere anytime soon so
should be durable enough from that
perspective and then we have let's see
pretty short cable but it looks like
this little accessory package here comes
with an extension cable so that you can
either plug into the back of a keyboard
on your desk or you can reach around all
the way from reach around or you can
reach round all the way to the back of
the case okay it also comes with a
couple of foam ear pads so you can
actually replace the plethora ones that
come with it and it looks like oh this
is actually really easy to do with foam
ones should you prefer that feel on your
ears of the lure or whatever you want to
call this on Tyrael okay let's move on
to the most patents gonna cop ones here
sorry about that
yeah I'm not still not feeling 100%
quite yet okay so this is the GTX or the
two-faced it is a spawn okay whatever
that means
it has this badass looking guy on it and
it says okay what is unique about this
mouse pad it is that it is a hundred
percent cloth but it is as fast as
plastic because it actually uses a
plastic coating over top so that's kind
of like the SteelSeries 5l which is a
cloth pad with a plastic layer on top
except that this is not a hard pad this
is actually still a rollable sort of
actual cloth pad whereas the 5l sits on
like a plastic back substrate sort of
thing so this is are quite a large
mousepad as you can see here look with
it in front of me so I've got the camera
man's like ghetto Mouse here just
totally sucks but in terms of terms of
glide actually I can't really see it
being any faster than the qck that I'm
using it
but I do like the rough textured feel
quite a lot if you can I don't know how
the cameraman it's gonna sort of capture
that but have a look and I also really
like how thick it is this is quite a
thick mousepad and it has nice nice
woven edges which is something that I've
noticed about Mikey CK is the edges are
getting quite frayed and I can see that
this would cause that to not happen the
back is are rubberized very grippy I'm
just obviously you've never used a mouse
on the back of a mousepad never do that
it's stupid
but I'm putting a mouse on the back of
it so that I can demonstrate it's quite
grippy when you put it down on the desk
and it's not gonna move if even if you
lift your Nelson kind of that sort of
thing anyway thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the Zoe gear hammer &amp;amp;
2face bus pad</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
