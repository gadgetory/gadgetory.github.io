checked out a monitor with AMD freesync
and you can watch my video about the LG
34 um 67 up in the little I thing but it
might be the first freesync monitor to
impress me with its variable refresh
rate technology since it mostly avoids a
significant pitfall that the other one
didn't this is the BenQ XL 27 30 Z the
AMD gamers answer to the critically
acclaimed asus rog swift PG 278 Q that I
declared to be the best gaming monitor
yet in August of last year
freshbooks is the online accounting tool
for small businesses whose flexibility
and ease-of-use makes you feel like a
boss click my face to learn more let's
start the video with something BenQ
hasn't done as well as a soos the ID or
industrial design of the Excel 27 30 Z
instead of blowing red rings on the base
in a stunningly slim bezel BenQ has
taken the yo my eyes are up here
approached with a plane completely
uninteresting look but hey maybe that
works for them since you won't be giving
up anything as far as actual features
are concerned front and center is the
144 Hertz 2560 by 1440 16 by 9 8 bit TN
panel boasting one millisecond greater
gray response times basically no input
lag and what's this 72% NTSC color gamut
support so about equal to srgb
not too shabby yes it turns out that
much like the rog swift which likely
uses the same or a very similar panel
this is not your granddaddy's TN with
rubbish color accuracy nausea-inducing
color and contrast shift and a
washed-out low contrast overall
appearance and while i wouldn't
recommend it for any professional photo
editing anyone coming from an older or
less expensive commodity grade monitor
is going to be plenty impressed more
impressive stuff even though you don't
have to use it thanks to the Vesak
compliant holes at the back The Stand
features all the usual adjustments tilt
swivel height and even pivot and has
some unusual stuff like a spot to put
the puck controller that you can use to
navigate the on-screen menu a handle for
carrying it to and from LAN events both
headphone and microphone audio jacks and
even look at that a little headphone
holder right under that bad boy are two
of the USB 3.0 ports that run off the
built-in powered hub then around the
bottom we find the other two of those
along with a metric wack ton of other
i/o we've got the uplink for the USB hub
VG
I'm seriously VGA anyway DisplayPort
dual HDMI inputs one of which is HDMI
2.0 dual link DVI the connector for the
little controller puck and the
microphone pass-through you won't
actually need a pastor for your
headphones since your audio will
actually come over HDMI or DisplayPort
from your video card and that
DisplayPort port that's the one you're
going to want to use primarily if you're
a PC gamer because if you want to take
advantage of the big feature of the XL
27 30 Z AMD's freesync variable refresh
rate technology that is the input that
supports it for now so let's talk about
free sync just like in videos g-sync it
allows the graphics card to work in
tandem with the monitor to only update
the image on the display once a new
frame has been rendered by the GPU this
is to eliminate stuttering and tearing
in the onscreen animations as framerate
swing all over the place during a
typical gaming session but and this was
the issue I had with the 34 um 67 while
AMD in theory supports anywhere from 9
to 240 hertz refresh rates to match the
frames that the video card is outputting
per second modern LCD panels need to be
refreshed more often than nine times per
second or the image will actually start
to fade in between frames being drawn
causing an unpleasant flickering NVIDIA
handles this with a strategic frame
doubling or even tripling strategy that
they've implemented consistently on
their certified displays but on the
freesync side it's been left up to
monitor makers to determine how low they
can go so with my last monitor it
actually had an effective variable
refresh rate window with butter smooth
animations of only 48 to 75 Hertz a
window that one could easily exceed on
both sides in a single gaming session
but what about exceeding the range of
the window then well AMD handles this by
allowing you to either enable
traditional vsync and choose to deal
with some leg when frame rates are high
although it's fairly minor on a high
refresh rate display like this one
outside of the window
or deal with some tearing by disabling
vsync altogether
something Nvidia does not give their
users the option to choose but enough of
this theory stuff what's it like to game
on the thing well I started by
fine-tuning the image quality settings
because as much as then cues black
equalizer feature allows you to see bad
guys hidden in shadows it really does
look like but and I wish they wouldn't
enable it by default since it's only
really relevant for competitive play and
not the kind of sight scene gaming that
I typically do and then when I was done
with that I fired up some games overall
impressions not too shabby
free sync works as expected noticeably
smoothing animations regardless of
framerate so check out the ugly mini
tears in this street lamppost in Grand
Theft Auto 5 without freesync and then
check it out again with free sync and
the best thing about it is that it
doesn't disappoint the way that it did
with the LG ultra wide thanks to the
much wider variable refresh rate window
so the 2730 Z actually handles
everything from 40 to 144 Hertz which if
you tweak your graphical settings
correctly should be plenty of room to
stay inside but what if you do dip below
that 40 fps what I tried to do was
create a scenario with the r9 290x as
well as the GeForce GTX 970 where I'd be
floating in that 30 ish FPS range just
to see how they both felt in Grand Theft
Auto 5 and while I don't necessarily
agree with Scott at Tech Reports
assessment that the shift isn't that
noticeable or that there isn't much of a
difference what I do think is that any
PC gamer who is gaming on a 144 Hertz
display at that kind of a frame rate
should be changing the settings in the
game in order to get the best out of
their equipment anyway because neither
g-sync
nor freesync are able to maintain their
Wow the animation is still smooth even
though I dipped below 60 fps affect the
low around 45 FBI
anyway so it's basically a moot point
but Nvidia does seem to handle it a
little bit better so with that said even
though I could create situations where
the gaming experience wasn't as ideal or
quite as good as g-sync
thanks to the large window and the
configurability of PC games the excel
2730 Z looked great to me as a PC gamer
using variable refresh on an AMD
graphics card but there are some users
who might not be as thrilled with the
monitor it does have a touch more motion
blur compared to the RG swift again not
a closed ecosystem therefore harder to
control things like pixel timing blip
Adeeb loop and user Falcon teen from
overclock dotnet points out that because
BenQ didn't correctly implement single
strobe backlight modulation at some
refresh rates very notably 60 Hertz
motion blur reduction which is the
strobing backlight which doesn't work
alongside free sync and therefore I
would typically leave off on a PC anyway
won't work correctly on a game console a
bit of a bummer if you wanted this as a
multi-purpose display thanks to its
plethora of inputs which leaves just the
bottom line is it worth it wow if it was
the same price as my new favorite gaming
monitor the xB 270 hu an IPS 144 Hertz
g-sync monitor I would say no but at
$200 cheaper whoo it's really darn
competitive so that's pretty much it
