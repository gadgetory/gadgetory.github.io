s340 our prestigious stuff that doesn't
suck award for being a well-built case
with a smaller footprint at a fairly
reasonable price
since then the s340 has been a hit with
many system builders and now NZXT is
doubling down and releasing an all-new
razer edition s340 for folks who want to
pair it with their Razer peripherals or
who just really like the color green or
who well yeah anyways we'll be taking a
closer look at the s340 than we did the
original time showcased quite a while
ago and we'll see what new features
Razer brings to the table is it good
enough for your next case stay tuned to
find out and hit the like button if
you're interested in seeing us attempt a
hard drive platters swap without a clean
room and on a drive that we haven't seen
anyone do this too
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup click the link in the
video description to learn more so let's
get right into it the packaging that
ends a text to use is the same kind of
middle-of-the-road styrofoam that
they've been using for a while now and
although we were lucky enough not to
encounter any defects on the original
s340 that reviewed not this guy this
time around we had the misfortune of
having a family fall completely off of
its frame resulting in a broken fin and
some pretty serious initial
disappointment I'm not sure if this was
due to the packaging or if the fan was
just effective but it might have been
something NZXT should take a closer look
at in the future as numerous people have
complained about shipping damage on the
original s340
which we mentioned in our previous video
review which you can check out here
fortunately we were able to throw in a
replacement fan and just charge on
forward with our review the case itself
is nice and light for a mid Tower and
while I don't see it as a land party
case specifically as there's no handles
it wouldn't be too hard to lug around if
need be you'll be able to find a matte
black finish on the entire case in
contrast to the original s 340 which was
mostly glossy which which finishes
superior kind of depends on your
personal preference though I do
personally prefer matte finish above
glossy finish every time if for nothing
else than just its fingerprint
resistance with that said let's have a
closer look at the outside of this bad
boy the front of the case is completely
clean has a smooth look with the
exception of the light up green Razer
logo in the middle the left side panel
features a large highly tinted window to
show off your components the tinting is
quite dark and might be too much for
some people who really want to be able
to see their rigs innards in detail but
folks who want a more stealthy look
might really go for it in any event
adding some cheap LEDs on the inside is
an option as well if you want to
brighten stuff up the right side panel
is bare and continues the cases stealthy
matte look moving to the top you'll find
a 120 millimeter fan included this
particular one here is white as you can
probably see but we had to replace the
previously installed
so it won't be white a few buy yours the
amount does support up to 140 millimeter
fans if you want to swap the current one
out and the included fans the two
included fans in the case our rifle
bearing bass fans with three pin
connectors you can plug them into
whatever you want
you also get power button at the top
which glows green with the computer is
on as well as headphone and microphone
jacks a green hard drive activity light
and two USB 3.0 ports in a Razer green
instead of the traditional blue I
especially liked how the power button
gave a nice hard click when I pressed it
so you know for sure that it's been
activated do note that there is no reset
button on this case however make it a
little bit more difficult to cycle your
system although not a ton of people use
them anyways the back of the case
features a button that allows you to
easily turn the case lights on or off
the rest of the back is pretty standard
you get that second 120 millimeter fan
and the regular complement of seven PCIe
slots the thumb screws for the slots are
covered on the outside of the chassis
presumably to save space on the inside
you do need to remove an extra panel
that's held on with a thumb screw beside
these slots to install the PCIe cards
though this is an improvement over the
original s340 we've simply left that
space open exposing the inside of your
case the side panels are held on with
captive thumb screws that include small
little washers to keep them from
scratching your cases finish which is
actually pretty cool and there's also a
thumb screw bracket for your power
supply we get easy to install and remove
said power supply from your case the
bottom has some ground effect lighting
again in that Razer green which you're
probably expecting which produces a
pretty powerful visual effect in a room
with maybe dim lighting and this makes
the case look kind of like something out
of fast and furious but you might be
going for that no judgment no judgement
what's not as cool as this is the power
supply dust filter however the original
s3 40 came with a flimsy but still
functional filter that didn't have a
frame and was just kind of held in place
with some small metal Clips forgivable
since it was a budget minded case the
razor Edition comes with the same filter
but once we removed it it was a little
tricky to reinstall because you have to
bend the thing into a couple of tiny
holes or
lots underneath where the under glow
lights are even on a budget case
something as simple as a dust filter
should really be not that hard to work
with you do however get the same nice
rubber feet that you did on the original
s340 that give your case a nice amount
of clearance which is especially
important if you'll be using it in a
carpeted area so now let's explore the
inside starting behind the front panel
the front bezel is a little bit
difficult to remove because there's pegs
and they're stiff and I don't like pegs
but whatever once you give it a good tug
you'll get the thing off under there
you'll find a much nicer magnetic dust
filter which is easy to remove reinstall
clean all that good stuff and space for
two 120 millimeter fans or two 140
millimeter fans or a 240 millimeter
radiator or 280 millimeter radiator if
you prefer your water cooling side of
things however because of the mounting
location of the PCB for your top IO
you have to install the fans between the
radiator and the front of the case or
you won't have enough room at the top
once we figure this out though
installing a full size 2 180 millimeter
closed loop water cooler was actually
pretty easy there's also a very nice
amount of clearance between the bezel
and the front of the chassis itself so
your fans should get some good airflow
from the top and bottom of the case make
sure though to be careful when removing
this front bezel as the wires for the
light-up Razer logo connect to a plug
that's cable managed through it in a
hole in the frame and stuff and it's
very easy to snag the plug on the hole
and because the wires are so thin you
can snap them right apart which is what
happened to us during the review process
fortunately we were able to solder the
thing back together and get the light
working again but it is something you
should definitely be wary of behind the
phantom radiator mounts there's a cable
management bar which kind of separates
itself a little bit and well allows you
to manage cables behind it instead of
the typical series of holes that we'd
see on other cases with possibly some
grommets in it it features a Razer logo
though it's a little hard to see with
everything being closed behind the
window tinting because it is not
actually illuminated the bar itself
however is actually pretty useful I like
that it comes into the middle of the
case a little bit because you have more
space there and something like a 24 pin
cable which can have a bunch of extra
bulk you don't have to try to cram and
behind the motherboard tray on these
style of cases you might not have a ton
of space behind that motherboard tray so
that 24 pin is taking up a lot of
valuable real estate so if you kind of
shove it up there a little bit can I get
out of the way speaking of the
motherboard tray you'll find
pre-installed standoffs in the proper
places for an HDX board with a peg in
the center to help you avoid frustration
during assembly which is great I love
those things there's also a couple of
cable management holes up the top on
either side for things like your 8 pin
eps connector and system fan headers
there aren't rubber grommets but the
holes do a pretty good enough job
regardless directly below the
motherboard tray we have an h4 40 s
basement area there are two thumb screw
mounts for your SSDs on top of the
basement which lets you show them off
which is great as well as cable
management holes behind them for both
your SATA cables and anything you need
to plug into the bottom of your
motherboard the inside of the basement
contains both your power supply and non
removable hard drive cage that you can
hold to mechanical hard drives in or
SSDs do note though that the case
doesn't come with any SSDs adapters so
you'll have to use some third-party
solution or just leave it there to be
completely honest doesn't really matter
you'll also need screws for the hard
drive mounts where as they aren't to
lists and as with the original s 340
you'll either need to remove the power
supply or use a short screwdriver to get
to the kind of second screw further
inside the basement
you can mount one more drive on the
floor of the case which you'll need to
screw in through the bottom and if
you're concerned about drive air flow
the vents near the top of the basement
above the cage so you're kind of hard
drive heat can go into the main part of
your case and be blown away from there
for those of you that don't want this
and would rather block it off there
isn't a stock solution but I'm sure you
can figure something out the drive cage
is also where you'll find the
accessories kit you get screws zips ties
a handy socket for in moving and
installing standoffs and a couple of
razor stickers that you can stick on
things like a case moving behind the
right side panel we see that NZXT has
included some cable management options I
counted 4 heal management loops on the
bar 3 near the front and another 11
on the motherboard tray which is
freaking awesome actually especially as
I've seen far fewer options on larger
more expensive cases pre-installed
cables are nearly pre managed with
bakery style twist ties including the
fans which come connected to a molex
powered fan hub that also provides power
to the case lights there are a couple of
caveats though if you use the front
cable loops it may be a bit harder to
close the side panel as it can get
caught on whatever cables are there also
all the cable management bar is a good
idea overall it can make connecting
cables to side mounted SATA ports a
challenge as you have to kind of thread
them through a narrow gap and then plug
them in without a lot of clearance for
your fingers there's some ways to do it
but it's not as easy so can we say that
the NZXT s340 razor Edition doesn't suck
just like its predecessor the answer is
a definitive yes the one drawback is
that you're gonna have to pay an extra
maybe 30 bucks to get the razor branding
and case lighting which may move it out
of the budget realm for some buyers at
100 US dollars but the build quality is
very good throughout with the only
plastic being on the front bezel and the
case was also pretty quiet even though
it doesn't have any actual noise
dampening features specifically anywhere
so if you want a stealthy black and
green build and don't mind plunking down
a few extra dollars the NZXT s340 razor
Edition definitely worth a look
