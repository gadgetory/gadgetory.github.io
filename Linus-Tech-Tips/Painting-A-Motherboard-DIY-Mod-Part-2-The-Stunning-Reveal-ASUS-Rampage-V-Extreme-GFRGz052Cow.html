color of your motherboard it will be the
epic conclusion and I we don't actually
know yet
if it's going to be epic win or epic
fail but stay tuned with us as we try
and figure out the best technique for
removing the paint from the contacts and
then test the board to see if it
actually works because if it survives
this mod this is the board that's going
to be going in my personal system so I
need it to actually be functional in
order for me to be comfortable doing
that wish me luck

now to learn more so this is the
conclusion of our two-parter on
motherboard painting and I'd like to
both finish up the process which some of
you thought was done but actually had a
lot more work left to do and address
some of the criticism in the comments
from part one so let's pick up where we
left off just having removed the tape
the quality of the paint job is just not
what I was hoping for from a distance it
looks pretty good but I was extremely
disappointed that I had missed a couple
of masking areas leaving overspray on
some motherboard components and even the
PCB some viewers suggested a liquid
masking material that peels off might be
a good bet for next time but given how
much flack I'm taking for making this a
two-part video because it took me two
days I figure if I spent another day
fussing about with learning a new
masking technique you'll be none too
pleased but I was at least happy to
observe that with some rubbing alcohol
and cotton buds I was able to remove
overspray from caps and even the PCB
very quickly and effectively and Oh
sometimes to effectively I actually
ended up making a total mess of this PCI
Express slot just by rubbing up against
it some ghetto painting followed that
screw up I didn't have a brush handy and
I was trying to finish this in a timely
manner so the bazillion pack of cotton
balls that Nick bought actually allowed
me to cover the damaged spot and even
though the surface finished kind of
sucks in that spot now it's hard to
notice unless you put your face right
next to it one thing that worked better
than I expected for touch-ups was
spraying a bit of paint onto
little metal poker and dabbing that onto
key areas I was able to fix up a lot of
little areas where the masking was too
close to a vertical surface to get good
coverage including the PCI Express slots
RAM slots one of the USB 3 headers and
even the red accent on the vrm heatsink
assembly so basically everything now a
lot of folks asked why we used the paint
material we did rather than Plasti Dip
or at least priming it first the reason
we didn't prime is that I wanted to
avoid any more material buildup than
necessary on the slot contacts and the
reason for no Plasti Dip is that while
it can be removed which is convenient
when you scratch it it has a thick
rubbery consistency that could have
gummed up the slots and necessitated
filling the PCIe USB 3 SATA and RAM
slots with something to protect them
such as cardboard or dead components but
even I don't have dead ddr4 lying around
and while I do have cardboard it would
have made even paint coverage much more
difficult especially for slots that will
be left empty in the finished system
we're not going for a two-tone color
scheme here so the reason we did it the
way we did was that we wanted the paint
to flake off easily from the contacts
this just makes me feel horrible inside
ok so we're gonna go ahead and
repeatedly install and uninstall this
why don't we do three per slot again
just to oh it's just as bad this idea
clearly seemed idiotic to a lot of you
and honestly I was huh
on your side hearing the crunch of
installing components into each slot for
the first time but I can assure you that
some of the other ideas in the video
comments things like desoldering the
slots to remove them painting them and
re soldering them are much worse I'm
actually not aware of anyone ever
successfully removing and replacing a
PCIe slot let alone a Ram slot on a
modern lead-free solder board and stop
stop do not post the link because even
if someone has done one slot without
breaking the board they didn't do eight
on a single board so let's not treat
that like a viable way to do this I mean
while it's not perfect our technique is
one that has
least been successfully used before
anyway with three insertions in each
slot behind us we turned our attention
to tearing down a test bench to fire up
the board and find out if it works at
this stage I had literally no idea if
the board was going to work and contrary
to what some of you seem to think that I
don't care about the hardware and was
just ruining a motherboard for fun I was
really really worried I had a dead
rampage v extreme on my hands and
genuinely wanted it to work it's not
like Asus is gonna send me a new one
because I painted the one they gave me
in the first place but this channel is
supposed to be about pushing the
boundaries and doing crazy stuff that
you wouldn't risk your own hardware to
do on your own so honestly I think a lot
of the crap about how this is an
unnecessary project is horseshit
we're not about to stop ghetto modding
and experimenting with this stuff
because it's unnecessary we don't
consider it a waste of time and money to
do something like this our monetary
investment is like four dollars in paint
and the time that we spend doing it is
time we would have spent making a video
anyway so yeah we risk losing the board
but that happens when you're trying new
things which is our job and anyway all
the hate about how we killed the board
should probably have waited until we
actually found out whether the board was
going to work or not so we started
logically we have dim slot a one which
spat out an error code but at least
managed to display some post codes on
the board then we followed up with dim
slot a2 which caused a reboot loop even
worse and then success dim a3 posted
followed by dim a4 which also posted so
um I expect retractions in the comments
under part one from everyone who
guaranteed the board was dead and called
us stupid for basically turning it into
garbage which actually no I don't expect
retractions this is the Internet so
anyway a few more tense insertions in
the first two slots later and all four
slots had successfully posted then it
was time for the real acid test would
the motherboard run all four slots in
quad channel and yes so we took it to
the next level and enabled XMP in the
BIOS our first attempt at 2800 megahertz
did fail but our second attempt at three
and megahertz a higher frequency but
more stable RAM divider on our board
succeeded and we even managed to do some
I 264 stress testing in the OS to
validate that the system was operating
correctly oh yeah and I forgot to
mention we checked in the BIOS to make
sure our video card was running at PCIe
16x as well so the board is fully
functional
take that haters all right so here we
are to be clear guys this project is not
something I'd recommend like seriously
we're having a do as I say not as I do
moment here yes it worked the paint we
ended up using covered extraordinarily
well given that we didn't use any primer
and the technique we used with some
tweaks like better masking and maybe the
use of a paintbrush for touch-ups
delivered a great 10-foot mod and even a
decent 5 foot mod but there is no
guarantee whatsoever that you'd have the
same success and for folks who pay $500
for their LG motherboards this is not
something I'd be comfortable endorsing
with that said I'm extremely pleased
with the results and I'm really looking
forward to installing this board in my
system for my x99 upgrade I've been
having a hard time finding the perfect
board since even the high end stuff that
we get to play with around here at the
office either head deal-breaker features
for me like chipset fans or little
things like the wrong color scheme so
this solved my admittedly very first
world problem and while I'm not sure if
I'd do it again I'm really glad that I
did it this time speaking of things
we'll be very glad you did today's
