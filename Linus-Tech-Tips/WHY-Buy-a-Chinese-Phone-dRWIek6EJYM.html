cutting edge nearly full display phone
that gearbest.com helped me get my hands
on last year and that I abandoned
reviewing after spending four hours
fighting with bootloader unlocking crap
in an attempt to load the English ROM on
it only to find out that Xiaomi had a
bloody English version coming a couple
weeks later anyway the me makes 2s so
called for it's speedier snapdragon 845
processor presumably is better across
the board anyway including the
out-of-the-box support for English but I
still can't figure out why anybody in
this hemisphere is buying premium phones
from brands like Xiaomi is there
something on the surface that I am
missing here like for example a sponsor
for this video like madrenas coffee
madrenas coffee blends specialty cold
brew coffee Zin two 16-ounce grab-and-go
cans for everyone's convenience check
them out and use offer code Linus to
save 40% at the link below
it's really easy to fall in love with
the me mix to s it manages to have the
sex appeal of a nearly bezel is design
coming just 1% shy of the screen ratio
of the iPhone 10 and that's without
resorting to an unsightly knotch and the
work that they've put into their
ceramic-coated back has paid off in
spades glass backed phones are back in
vogue now to enable wireless charging
but as hard as you might try a glass
back will never feel as premium nor via
as durable as this and after a similar
amount of time in my pocket my one plus
six is noticeably more scuffed up and
it's packed full of all the right
hardware sporting the latest generation
Snapdragon 845 processor up to eight
gigs of RAM up to 256 gigs of non
expandable storage blah blah blah blah
blah so it's super fast I think you guys
get the point and the price is right too
lining up right across the oneplus 6 as
a flagship grade phone for hundreds of
dollars less than you would pay a tier
one like Apple or Samsung and it's got
lightning-fast fingerprint unlocking the
ability to choose between button based
or gesture based navigation and even
wireless charging which as we outlined
in our video recently has the potential
when used properly to improve the
lifespan of your non removable but
respectably sized 3400 milliamp hour
battery so uh wait why was I so down on
this thing a couple of minutes ago I
still can't figure out why anybody in
this hemisphere is buying premium phones
from brands like jelly that seems kind
of unfair doesn't it I mean even the
dual rear camera absolutely blows away
previous generation efforts from Chinese
phone makers like this low-light shot
here does have more noise than any other
camera that I tested but it avoids the
over sharpening of the may 10 Pro and
the undesirable flaring of the Galaxy S
nine so I mean at least Xiaomi isn't
actively processing the image
to make it worse and then in this
challenging situation the me makes two s
ends up noisier than Samsung and with
less true-to-life colors from the one
plus six but it looks better than both
the iPhone 10 and the pixel to Excel and
under ideal conditions you can get some
really nice images out of it so let's
talk about some of the weaknesses of the
me macstew s the earpiece speaker isn't
amplified for stereo sound there's no
water resistance at least nothing
officially IP rated 1080p slo-mo only
goes to 120 fps
rather than 240 the display is IPS
rather than OLED which means almost no
potential for burnin but at the cost of
ambient or always-on technology and
there is no headphone jack so you will
need to pull out an adapter every time
you want to watch my little pony at the
back of the bus without anybody finding
out so all that is kind of a drag but
again it's hundreds of dollars less for
tops back hardware and it's got no
display knotch so I can accept that
stuff even if I don't like all of it the
part that is unforgivable is the
software me UI is like going back in
time to when samsung still thought that
having a bunch of bloat in there okay
well that's Samsung still has a lot of
bloat in there so so um okay whatever in
jammies defense some of the stuff that
they include is legitimately useful like
a screen recorder app and a quick link
to my downloads but there were just so
many annoying things that I ran into
that ground my gears from having in my
pocket for two weeks
let's take Google Hangouts if I got a
message an hour ago but left it unread
because I wanted to deal with it later
every new message that I get or even
opening up another conversation
sometimes will make it pop up again why
when I create a folder on the homescreen
doesn't pull up the keyboard
automatically for me to start typing why
the included weather app wants access to
my phone for some reason when all it
should need is my location not to
mention that it cannot be removed or
even hidden so you have to create a
useless crap folder iOS style there's no
obvious way to expand a notification
from the lockscreen and reply to it
which is good for security but I would
like to at least have the option for my
convenience
I can't install Netflix off the App
Store the workaround seems to be to
track down the apk and install it
manually it wakes the screen for
notifications which is nice but not when
you lift the phone something that I've
come to take for granted these days and
there is no hardware button to launch
the camera yuck now taken individually
every one of those things would seem
like a pretty insignificant little gripe
and there are things that their software
does reasonably well so there screenshot
management something that I use a lot
blows one plusses out of the water and a
separate account for another user it's
super handy if I want to give the phone
to my kids but I don't want them
accessing all my stuff the bottom line
though is that this device was annoying
to use for me and not just compared to a
flagship one like the s9 plus compared
to other devices that cost the same Yami
would do well to take a page out of one
plusses book on the software side of
things there isn't really such a thing
as stock Android anymore I mean even
Google's on pixel lineup customizes
stock Android but they would do well to
try to get a lot closer because the
hardware and the design are already
really impressive so I'm looking forward
to seeing continued improvement speaking
of improvement the only thing that could
improve this video is this message from
our sponsor Corsair Corsairs unplug and
play series we'll get rid of the wires
in your life the dark core RGB se Mouse
is quick featuring one millisecond 2.4
gigahertz and low latency Bluetooth
connectivity and if you opt for the
wireless
charging model you can actually charge
it with Corsairs mm 1000 or any
compatible qi wireless charging pad
there k63 wireless gaming keyboard
features the same low latency connection
options and Cherry MX red switches with
a blue LED backlight and you can check
out their entire lineup at the link
