works at Linus Media Group is super tech
savvy but you'd assume wrong so let's
take a look at Colton's game streaming
setup so this is it this is the room
where quite literally dozens of people
tuned in to watch Colton game stream and
ignore his wife every week oh what's
this I see that's a factory router that
this thing so this is it Colton this is
how you ended up with the free router
upgrade from Meg here
so Nick here wanted to sponsor a video
where we took the LMG employee with the
worst networking setup and got them up
to speed and I think we have chosen
wisely
in some ways Colton's Wi-Fi woes are a
bit of a first-world problem now a lot
of people live in apartments where all
the different competing access points
make it so that it's hard to get a
decent amount of airtime so you can get
adequate latency for gaming or enough
bandwidth for things like Netflix
streaming but Colton has a bit of a
different problem he lives so far out in
the sticks that it's a non-issue but the
thing is you've got to have pretty
decent range or you're gonna drop your
signal so let's run around and take a
look at what some of the problems aren't
here okay so problem number one is that
on Colton or should I say Cal Taine's
stream it's become a bit of a running
gag that his internet connection just
drops out outright but the thing is
you're actually plugged in via a wire so
is this thing just that bad that you
just lose you stream even though the so
it's the internet working like other
devices still work most of the time yes
but the real issue from a like household
harmony standpoint it's not Colton's
gaming rig let's face it his wife
doesn't care if his game streaming setup
is working it's Netflix so especially
when Colton's streaming there are issues
with Netflix not just not defaulting to
the utmost of quality we actually
unfortunately missed an opportunity
where we were really watching this punch
in and out of high and low resolution
here but that's the thing about Wi-Fi
for some reason why is your TV hooked up
via Wi-Fi okay it doesn't it doesn't
matter doesn't matter anyway the point
is that especially while Colton's
streaming Steph has issues with Netflix
and that's when it matters the most when
she's being ignored when all she has his
Netflix so if Netflix doesn't work now
what so just to get a baseline for what
our Wi-Fi signal looks like around the
house we're using a tool called Wi-Fi
analyzer here to have a look at both the
2.4 G and 5g bands so overall signal
strength from within the house actually
not too bad and actually that's bizarre
even out in the yard the same
strength is pretty darn good cold
nothing must just really suck if you're
dropping your connection maybe we just
need to get on with this I was actually
going to connect to their Wi-Fi and do
some speed testing but the the piece of
paper with the password has apparently
fallen down next to the fridge because
the magnet came off and they never
changed the password on their access
point you could for Shane Colton wow
this is actually a really significant
upgrade you're going from like zero to
basically top-of-the-line for an AC
router so this is the XR 500 from
Netgear and what makes it special aside
from just having powerful hardware in it
is that it's running Douma OS which is
made by a company called net duma and
their goal was to create a network
appliance operating system that has
advanced functionality some of which
that you wouldn't normally find in like
a home router but more importantly make
all those functions accessible even to
people who don't know a ton about
networking and overall it's getting rave
reviews even just from the net duma
routers and i'm really excited to see
what a company like Netgear who's
already well known for their powerful
home access points is able to do with it
oh my god the stock password for this
thing is rustic road 168 it's like they
knew who it was for this is great so you
know what I think the real test is here
we are in the duma last dashboard can
colton do it well first you need to set
your Wi-Fi to something that is not
rustic road 168 here so uh here okay
yeah you drive you so I did the funniest
thing for a while I live in a cul-de-sac
and so I called the SSID at the corner
house so that people be like
which one is the corner house that's
good it's not that funny that's great
I'm gonna do what I did like hate my
neighbors Wow not bad I'm gonna do it
well I don't care okay that won't nobody
uses Wi-Fi okay do it let me do it you
did it all right that really wasn't the
point of today's video though anyway
that's that's fine that's just so that
now we can actually get on your Wi-Fi oh
hey
not bad hey Colton good news you're like
eight percent faster than you're
supposed to be on the download anyway
dang also your Wi-Fi is as fast as your
wired now now we're outside though and I
mean it's acceptable like we're still
getting over 100 megabit down there so
that's not bad
but hey Netgear was like yeah we want
this place to have like amazing Wi-Fi
everywhere and we were like okay so
we're gonna put a range extender in yeah
this is like perfectly fine for whatever
you're doing right now planning LTX
presumably yes in a perfect world you
would actually hook up a range extender
via wired Ethernet because that way
you're not using up precious spectrum
communicating from the range extender
back to your router but this particular
one this is the X 6s is actually a
tri-band Wi-Fi range extender so since
most devices cannot actually use three
bands at once you can have a dedicated
band as like a back channel and then
you've got dedicated bands for out there
in your yard for whatever devices you're
using so you use one five gigahertz for
your backhaul and then another five
gigahertz out there and you're tuned a
half gigahertz out there so we can
actually put this anywhere we want as
long as it's close enough to your game
streaming room and it has a power outlet
thank ya so you want it in that corner
because it also happens to have an
Ethernet switch on it so this looks like
a place where people sit and use their
computer and then they could use it with
a wire
this works I just used WPS because I was
lazy so I'm gonna put that there
and I'm gonna go back outside happy I
don't know what I was expecting but
looks like double the speed hey oh he
got me i high-fived colton I
congratulated him
good job Colton thanks you rock man and
now your internet rocks just as much as
you do okay so now that everything's
working we can actually poke around in
the software a little bit starting with
the device manager which is this cool
map of your entire network so you've got
your router here at its heart and then
you've got your wired devices so Philips
hue and desktop gd9 whatever that's this
guy and then you've got your two point
four and five gigahertz Wi-Fi from
inside here you can see any details
about the device so in the case of my
phone it managed to grab my MAC address
the name of the device the type of the
device it knew it was a phone and if you
know that's not your phone you can go
ahead and quickly block if it's like
your neighbor piggybacking off your
Wi-Fi or something along those lines
then once you got your map of devices
you can actually play around with them a
fair bit in the QoS tab so they've got a
feature called anti buffer bloat which
basically will detect well you can
actually excited to go all the time but
I'd recommend leaving it on detecting
it'll detect high-priority traffic which
would be game traffic and then when it
detects that you can set a certain
amount of your overall bandwidth to
leave alone to reserved for that
high-priority traffic and then another
amount let's say you know 70% for
everything else on the network so that
way you're still going to be able to use
Netflix but your gaming packets are
gonna be able to jump the queue another
cool thing here is this little graphical
bandwidth allocation now QoS is not a
new concept it's present on everything
from entry-level up to enterprise grade
routers but having it laid out
graphically like this is pretty cool so
we can say ok Philips hue you get 1% of
the bandwidth you are like super not
important versus let's just go ahead and
update that desktop gd9 whatever you get
like
I don't know 75% of the upload because
that's really where most of the
uploading in this house happens then we
could also take you know my 1 plus 7 you
could say ok you get you know 2% so now
you can see that our download speed is
significantly less than the 300 megabit
we had before and we're only getting
about half of the upload allocated to us
the other cool gaming centric feature is
called geo filter and what this
basically does is in the old days you
used to just refresh a list and you
could see all the servers for a given
game and connect to the one that has
really low ping but nowadays it's all
matchmaking base so you don't really get
to do that what this does is on your
routers level it will actually block any
game servers that are too far away such
that they're going to result in a less
than satisfactory gaming experience so
you just set whatever radius you want so
I could say I don't want to connect to
anything that's less than a thousand
kilometers so basically I'm only gonna
be playing on like West Coast North
America servers and then we go ahead and
add a device this guy right here and
what games okay so this is
cross-platform actually most of these by
the way Call of Duty's PC battlefield
cross platform will go ahead and say
yeah Call of Duty auto I'll play on a
server that is more than a thousand
kilometers away pretty cool right so
there you have it guys that was how
Colton managed to scan his work into
giving him a free network upgrade yeah
you can I guess you can you can hold on
to this so I never really understood
that upgrading your router really
mattered until this project some of the
doom OS features are really cool like
they're geofilter I use it when I'm
playing Rainbow six siege early on like
a Saturday morning when I'm you know I'm
on the West Coast servers and I'm
getting paired up with people from the
EU so using that feature actually
manages to get me in servers that are
actually on the west coast which is
really good and if you use a VPN you can
actually set up on the router instead of
having it on each device that you won't
that way you use doom OS to specify
which program should go through the VPN
and which don't so it doesn't slow down
your game so some other cool points is
that Netflix is a lot more stable now we
have much better coverage in our
backyard plus Steph can have a wired
internet connection which uses our
laptop in our kitchen
because the extender has two Gigabit
Ethernet ports on it
plus there's four more on the router
itself back in my office other extenders
often create a separate network so you
have to connect to a different network
in each part of the house which is super
annoying but this router and extender
automatically forms a single mesh
network so there's just seamless roaming
between them so thanks to Netgear for
sponsoring colton streams not cutting
out all the time very valuable Cal tain
on Twitch ok go check it out subscribe
to PewDiePie excuse me that's it that's
dead dead me oh guys so thanks for
