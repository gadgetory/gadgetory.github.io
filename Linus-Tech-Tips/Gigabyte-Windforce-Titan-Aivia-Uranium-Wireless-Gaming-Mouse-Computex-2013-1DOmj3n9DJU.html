solution that's that you can hook up on
these ports this is the all-new wind
force cooler that takes advantage of a
composite of a couple of different heat
pipe technologies so it has like a
textured inside as well as micro grooves
that allows it to more easily take the
cooled liquid and then move it back to
the GPU where it needs to be heated up
and then evaporated again I mean that's
the basic principle of how heat pipes
work what this allows gigabyte to do is
between those high-performance heat
pipes check how thick those ones are
between those high-performance heat
pipes and the overall mass of the cooler
they are able to build coolers for the
gtx 770 780 and Titan that are capable
of dissipating 450 watts within what is
still a 2 slot profile now hold on a
minute is that what's going on here is
that an aftermarket cooled Titan 6 gig 6
gigs of memory aftermarket cooling no
one's allowed to do that gigabyte is
going to be releasing this as a bundle
so you'll actually get it with a stock
Titan cooler on it instructions and a
win for schooler so that you can swap
out the cooler on your own giving you
the advantages that come with better GPU
cooling particularly with GPU boost 2.0
now GPU boost 2.0 allows you to not only
set up your overclocking profiles by
power as well as by clock speed and
voltage but also by temperature so when
you have a lower temperature on your
card you are going to actually
legitimately get better performance
whether you're hardcore overclocker or
not which hasn't been true necessarily
with other graphics cards in the past
now they've got a practical
demonstration of this which I thought
was pretty cool the maximum temperature
will recommend a temperature from Nvidia
for a gk110 or GK 104 is around 95
degrees so they've got a variety of
different heat loads that you can apply
to this elaborate setup here with the
wind force cooler on it you can see our
ambient temperature here which is about
30 31 degrees you can see the heat load
being applied to the wind force cooler
and then you can see right here the
temperature that it maintains the car
dad so the TDP s of these cards are only
actually 250 watts but even applying an
excess of 400 watts to this cooler we
are not breaking
the highest we've seen it is around 80
degrees and change a little above that
and that's in 31 degree ambience moving
right along to gaming peripherals this
is where diesel started geeking out so
this right here is the idea uranium
which has a number of different things
so first of all here actually I'll get
our lovely model to demo it in just a
second I'm gonna steal it first
sorry about that on the bottom check
this out I love this my old MX 700 had
two double-a batteries on the bottom
what's the advantage of double-a well
number one they're everywhere so you
never have to worry about not having a
charge when something bad happens and
your batteries die number two is their
high capacity this thing runs for 50
hours continuously so if you actually
manage to run out of battery life with
this mouse in between charges then you
probably should go to sleep anyhow but
that's not it so it's wireless but I
would love for you to come in here sorry
and demo what is special about this
particular Wireless implementation so
how do you charge it okay you charge it
just with a simple micro USB cool thing
about that is micro USB charges the
mouse while you're using it or if you
don't need to charge the mouse at the
time you've got a micro USB handy on
your desk you can use it to charge your
phone next up okay so the wireless
implementation in the past Wireless
might have had problems with
particularly not necessarily with you
know left-click doesn't register
whatever else like that but particularly
with the execution of macros so instead
of putting the macro memory onto the
mouse which by the way is also one fewer
thing to power on the mouse so that's
where you get that extended battery life
macro memory has now been integrated
here so show me how you can switch
between the variety of different
profiles that can be stored on the base
station another advantage of the base
station while you guys watch the
interface here is the fact that it's
it's very close to the mouse as opposed
to being plugged into the front of your
tower or into the back of your case
meaning that it's less likely to have
any interference and because it's closer
you're gonna have faster data
transmission it uses a 6500 DPI twin I
laser sensor and you can set up I
believe it's up to five profiles is that
correct yep I'm getting the okay now
we've got the a via osmium keyboard so
this has been updated you've got five
different profiles here and what's cool
is you've got a multicolor light here so
you can tell which profile you're
you've also got dedicated scroll wheels
for a brightness which has very fine
granularity to the adjustments that you
can make you can click it and turn it
off so it's actually it's actually just
a mouse wheel very very cool as well as
a volume wheel media keys that are
accessible with a function functionality
and check this out
we're not limited to just one key switch
type anymore these are Cherry MX browns
if you guys have been watching Lynas
tech tips a long time you'll know these
are my personal favorite key switches so
I am more than thrilled to see that
being applied to gigabytes keyboard
lineup also it has a nice wide wrist
rest and personally I don't really like
it but my wife refuses to use anything
but our SteelSeries 7g because of the
large angled wrist rest so for people
out there who want that now you have
another option that isn't Cherry MX
black with what is quite frankly a
fairly dated feature set that doesn't
include LED backlighting or any of those
kinds of bells and whistles don't miss

making sure that you're subscribed and
guys big thanks to our sponsors who
remember our WD NCIX and Corsair
Vengeance gaming peripherals without
them we wouldn't be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
