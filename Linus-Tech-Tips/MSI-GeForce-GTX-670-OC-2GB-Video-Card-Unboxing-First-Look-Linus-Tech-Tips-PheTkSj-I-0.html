the msi geforce gtx 670 OC so this is an
overclocked version of this already very
fast very overclockable hence the
factory overclocked editions of the card
that are available at launch GPUs so
this is using the GK 104 GPU from Nvidia
which is the same one that is used in
their flagship single GPU card the GTX
680 but the only difference is they've
cut back some of the food of course and
they have that's about it they dialed
back the frequency a little bit but you
look at guys like MSI going and
releasing 1.0 4 or 5 gigahertz graphics
cards and the frequency isn't dialed
back at all so what what what am I gonna
say right because that's the only
difference the the memory is still
clocked at 6 gigahertz and it is still
using a 256 bit bus which is the first
time we've seen that in quite a while I
mean gtx 570 had the memory bus cut back
from the 580 the 470 had the memory bus
cut back from the 480 and then even
going back to the 260 was cut back from
the from the 280 so yeah this is yeah
this is like a totally totally new thing
for us to see that India didn't do that
moving right along
GPU boost is supported which means that
it will dynamically adjust the clock
speed of your graphics card according to
the power and heat attributes that it is
aiming for so whatever targets it'll
just wrap things up according to how
much Henry min has left this guy comes
with the DVI to VGA adapter to dual
molex to single PCIe 6 pin adapters a
driver disk which you shouldn't use just
download the latest as well as a
whatever this is Quick Start Guide and
then another Quick Start Guide awesome
this is a really old character I don't
think they've used that one since like
GeForce
6,000 space so this this guide must be
an assorted recycled here but you know
there's no point if it ain't broke don't
fix it right new graphics card doesn't
necessarily mean the rules for plugging
in a PCI Express card change am i right
okay
so let's get this baby opened up I can
already see some trademark MSI stuff
going on over here there are little blue
covers for the connectors as well as the
display ports and the ports that you
connect to displays that are not called
display port as well as they're also
somewhat trademark almost black PCB
which you'll see on like other msi
products such as the gtx 560 TI huh see
not quite black but still looks really
slick in your case I'm just gonna put
that aside for now um am I missing here
right the two gigs right it has two gigs
of memory which means that even if
you're running a surround configuration
you should still be okay
I mean yeah the Radeon HD 7950 if you're
especially if you're running three
high-resolution displays might perform a
little bit better in your given game but
you're going to be missing the 3d vision
surround support as well as physics and
all the other exclusive Nvidia
technologies including their TxAA modes
which give you better image quality but
with a lesser performance that compared
to traditional multi sampling
anti-aliasing as well as adaptive vsync
which gives you especially in those
multi display configurations this can be
a big problem because vsync if you go
above the display above the refresh rate
of your monitor will cause tearing which
means that instead of being aligned
things will look kind of like this in
the middle of your screen and if you go
below it has to use a multiple or a
factor of your refresh rate so that
means if you are capable of running at
55 FPS it will chalk you all the way
down to 30 because you're running vsync
so it'll turn it adapted vsync turns it
on when you're up there and off when
you're down here so you can get the most
out of your graphics card three plus one
displays are supported so we've got ya
HDMI and DisplayPort and then two DVI
parts so you can run three of the
in 3d vision surround and then one
auxilary display for you no system
monitoring utilities or whatever else
that you need to show on that fourth
display so that is right up to four
displays 4k monitor support as well as
HDMI 1.4 a gives you a 3d over HDMI as
well has a very efficient PCB design so
you can see and videos reference design
which is what this card is using even
though it is factory overclocked so it
is slightly non-reference
is a very very short PCB and NVIDIA has
relocated the power delivery to the
other side of the GPU which is something
that we haven't really seen before
except on you know dual GPU cards where
they don't really have a choice and they
have to kind of read finagle things
pretty differently compared to a single
GPU card multiple SLI connectors means
we are compatible with multi Way SLI
configurations and we are you also using
PCI Express 3.0 the card is also as you
can clearly see fully capable of
supporting up to four gigs of memory
without any difficulties so that would
be a great configuration to four gig
cards with a three monitor setup means
you're going to have enough memory to
store all the textures that you need as
well as the uber horsepower that you
need from the GPUs themselves in order
to drive that kind of a resolution so
for anyone considering an SLI
configuration for the GTX 670 I would
definitely recommend going with the four
gig cards if you're going to have
multiple monitors or even one high
resolution monitor such as that one it's
a 30-inch monitor running at 2560 by
1600 I think that pretty much covers it
this card uses a blower design is a
reference card so almost all of the heat
that is accumulated here and cooled here
is going to be exhausted out the back of
the case much like the 680 NVIDIA has
redesigned things somewhat in order to
give you a more dead space between the
i/o shield as and the heatsink itself so
that just gives you slightly better
airflow out the back of the card and
just sounds like a quick length
comparison it's just a little shorter
than a GTX 680 although if you have a
smaller heatsink on it your your water
cool it or something I bet you could fit
this in a very very small case without
any
difficulty whatsoever which is really
cool I think that pretty much wraps it
up so what is it it's a cheaper slightly
less powerful although
overclockable to the point where you
could get similar performance to a 680
card it's starting to look like a pretty
darn good value thank you for checking
