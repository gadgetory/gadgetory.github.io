gets featured on the when show build
blogs the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it welcome to my unboxing an overview of
the Mayflower OH - or objective -
headphone amp and we've actually also
got the O DAC headphone amp combo unit
as well in terms of packaging they're a
pretty small company so we got I guess
about the best you could expect from a
smaller company so it arrived in a box
with packing materials and all that good
stuff I took some pictures at the time
but I have since gotten rid of it
because I was on my motorbike and I
couldn't take the box away with me so
let's start with what is a headphone
amplifier in the simplest possible terms
it's a component of your audio setup
that allows you to drive volume higher
and assuming it's reasonably well
designed it can also noticeably improve
the audio quality on any device that is
plugged into whether it's a PC phone mp3
player or whatever else so what is this
thing specifically this is a variant of
the objective - from Mayflower as I said
before it adheres strictly to the
original o2 design so the quality of the
internals is undeniably solid and it
features a rugged aluminum housing that
is available in silver or black there
are other options available on the
Mayflower website such as a quarter inch
Jack option
there's upgraded knobs which we do have
here on the black one you can check out
all of the options in the pricing and
availability link in the video
description there may even be a special
discount for Linus tech tips for members
just throwing that out there
the o2 or objective 2 was designed by an
audio engineer enthusiast guy who went
by the name of NW AV guy or Northwest AV
guy with the goal of creating a simple
value optimized amp that purely does
what it's supposed to do amplify the
signal from your audio source without
altering the sound signature so that is
to say with a neutral sound signature or
flat frequency response if this will
allow audio files without spending a ton
of money to get the most out of their
expensive cans he's basically dropped
off the face of the earth at this point
but not before giving permission to di
wires and entrepreneurs like Mayflower
alike to manufacture the design that he
created all of the i/o is on the front
of this unit which is great because it
can be put on a desk or even shoved into
a bag due to its ability to be powered
for eight to ten hours by two
rechargeable nickel metal hydride 9-volt
batteries from left to right we see DC
power in the power button itself the
headphone out volume adjustment knob a
gain toggle which is essentially a
switch to increase the loudness of the
signal depending on the impedance of the
headphones you're trying to drive you
may need more gain for higher impedance
headphones the stock configuration is 2
and 1/2 x gain and 6 and 1/2 x gain but
that can be changed if you want anything
from 1x to 12 X and finally source input
that can be anything with a three and a
half millimeter jack or even an adapter
using the o2 amp is simple no drivers or
anything just turn up the volume of your
source so like your phone to the maximum
plug it into the amp plug in your
headphones - I would suggest turning the
amp down initially because you could
like blow your ears out and then adjust
to the point where it's comfortable and
you're ready to hear a difference in the
quality of your music or other content
with that said the amp is only one part
of the audio pipeline so to speak you
may find that while a better amp can
noticeably improve the listening
experience particularly with decent
quality headphones let's say in the $200
range and up it can also draw your
attention to deficiencies in other parts
of the pipeline that you never noticed
before low-quality compressed mp3s will
sound muddy and ugly and pops and random
interference from particularly terrible
audio sources like bad onboard computer
audio will come through loud and clear
improving the source audio files audio
files sorry not always cracked me up the
files using higher-quality files such as
lossless formats or even 320 bit mp3s
will help regardless of whether you've
got a fancy new amp but if your DAC
solution built into your PC is still
terrible then you'll need a DAC you can
get a sound card or you can get an
integrated unit that's designed to
perfectly match the o2 amp the O DAC the
second unit right here so this is the
silver one the black ones just the amp
contains the o2 amp and the O DAC within
the same chassis it looks mostly the
same other than that it shows off a
different external finish in front nob
this is the cheaper knob
except that it has a USB port at the
back that USB port requires no drivers
to be installed and works on PC and Mac
is applied the same principles of
striving for high quality with no
changes to the sound signature of the
original track and simple design to
achieve very very respectable results if
you're an audio geek you can check out
the performance measurements of the OU
DAC online but if you're not then you'll
just have to kind of take my word for it
it's very very good especially
considering the price so who is this for
these two solutions are priced at around
one hundred and thirty dollars and two
hundred and fifty dollars respectively
which might sound like a lot but if
you're a budding audiophile and you're
picking up a nice pair of headphones
anyway it could be argued that it is a
great investment
there's cheaper stuff out there from the
likes of file and others and there's
much more expensive stuff out there but
the o2 hits that sweet spot where the
general internet consensus seems to be
that spending less gets you a noticeably
worse experience and spending more
doesn't necessarily yield much of a
return on your investment until you
spend a lot more just the amp itself
made my phone sound noticeably better
with my relatively inexpensive IMS but I
didn't notice much of a difference
compared to say for example a decent
sound card with all of that said other
than my sennheiser HD 5 v 5s my
headphone collection consists largely of
very unexceptional cheapo gaming
headsets so take everything that I say
about my experience with it with a grain
of salt
speaking of salt audible.com slash Linus
is the place to go where for the same
price as a packet of salt at a fast-food
restaurant that is to say free you can
get an audiobook when you sign up for a
new membership they have over a hundred
and fifty thousand audiobooks including
salt sugar fat how the food giants
hooked us by Michael Moss and salt a
world history by mark Crowe Lansky so
you can get one of those particularly
that second one for free if that sounds
interesting
or something else if you prefer remember
guys that's audible.com slash Linus for
a free audiobook check it out
liked this video if you liked it dislike
it if you just liked it leave me a
comment with your thoughts on the o2
don't forget about that discount code
that you might find on the Linus tech
