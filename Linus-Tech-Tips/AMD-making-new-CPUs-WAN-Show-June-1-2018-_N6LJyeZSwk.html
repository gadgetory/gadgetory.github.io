this is this is quite emotionally
striking for him right now yeah I am
really not sure how to process this
right now okay legitimately this is
weird
yes like even just that part and the
back in order to like administer the
show you have to go that I go over here
like the number of years yeah that I
have been sitting to your left
yep and this is what happens when we let
a prime work on the land show set you
were sitting there so you were party to
it yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no yes
okay so one of my questions is why
didn't they just put the little table
over here I don't know because I can't
take this okay why do you is this yeah
that we sat on the couch no in the race
room Oh hold on no I was on the lift
still are you sure no I'm pretty sure I
was on the left but back then you still
had to administer to the left because
the table was forwarded to the left oh
here we go
okay whoa yes I used to be on this side
yeah but you in the middle left yeah oh
it was it was in the middle to the left
oh okay okay anyway other than what is
clearly wrong and terrible we have a
great show for you guys today
Intel launched to obtain dims yeah so
like mmm
modules but like using obtain super cool
so that's pretty cool
AMD is preparing new CPUs which are
super uninteresting but it's still good
that they're doing that but it's good
that they're doing that because the more
pressure we put on Intel the more likely
they are to release something other than
obtain dims those are still armed is
introducing a new processor with insane
performance
hooray it's gonna be the Razr processor
oh wow
did you ever see his keynote on the
razor phone no it's insane insane
performance you know what they put so
much that it was insane you know it's
funny like the rest of the internet
didn't seem to really pick up on that
the blower they didn't think it was as
funny maybe it's cuz I know him like
maybe that's part of it where like I was
just I was I was watching like someone
that I know in real life tried to do
like CEO keynote guy things and I was
like oh man you still have some work to
do what else we've got
oh we've got a rumor a couple of rumors
that Apple is gonna be launching one
iPhone model next year with three rear
cameras everyone is getting closer to
that
what was that camera called with like
Alden
oh my yeah start with an L I don't know
it's I don't remember if there's like a
million lenses on the front yeah yeah
we're getting closer to that becoming a
reality all also the Intel Core i7 8086
KS confirmed so we'll get to that after
the intro that I don't know maybe it
still works I don't know I don't know
every last time it broke and then I
fixed it live yeah that did that but
yeah I mean it sure yeah okay hold on a
minute hold on a minute is that the side
that I'm on now oh I think it is no cuz
that was made with the black coach yeah
oh wow this is messing with my whole
world
right now I'm actually not even sure so
I'm on the right side in there yeah and
if that's really weird
I forgot yeah despite it being shown to
us twice every week that's a hundred
times a year but for three years geez oh
wow all right all right okay so you've
had a pretty rough week yeah I've had a
pretty rough week
yeah and for some different reasons and
some of the same reasons so I'm gonna go
first um I'm leaving for Computex
I can't give you that mic pack because I
have to shoot one more video after this
she's changing the mic oh well then I
can give you this mic pack so I am
flying out for Computex very very
shortly and I will be gone for like ten
days
yeah I'm gone for a while I'm going to
Taiwan and then China which is of course
the same thing right Dennis are you
making that sound because you have like
a gag gag order so I'm going to Taiwan
then China yeah oh is he going with you
yeah yeah he's going with me oh yeah is
it gonna be a problem like going to
China with a Taiwanese like who lives in
Canada and like works in Canada but he
didn't stick her over his passport so I
think he's probably still okay did you
hear about all that no there was a thing
going around where I don't know if you
could get them from the government or if
people were making themselves but it was
like semi endorsed from the government
at first and then it wasn't later on but
there was stickers that got rid of the
Republic of China thing or whatever it's
called okay like on your Taiwanese
passport yeah and then people that
traveled with that to China were like
super denied entry Wow yeah but he has
not done this well that's interesting
isn't it he's let him in China yeah that
would be good so I'm going to Taiwan
than China
so I'm gonna be gone for ten days but
you're gonna notice something really
weird while I'm gone there's gonna be an
LT T video every day yeah so that's been
this week and last week and actually the
one before and then also we shot another
season of I was gonna mess with them oh
he's gonna say tech showdown because
then they'd be like oh no no one loves
tech and you know what I guess that's
okay yeah that's probably because
frankly I don't really love it either
yeah it had potential dude it had
potential ex the first episodes more
it's like it's like the sixth child you
know there was so much potential but you
just didn't really put the work into it
and it came out half-baked and so yes
new season of scrapyard wars I apologize
for all of the six child's out there and
guys the stick this time is pretty
insane it's insane so it's just a
classic Linus versus Luke which I don't
think we've done since season two with
the water cooling challenge has it been
that long yeah cuz after that it was the
three-way with Austin and then there was
BS mods yeah and then there was two V
two down in LA and that's all six season
to beat you up here yeah Wow
that's right with Jays two cents yeah
that's it interest so it's a classic
lioness versus Luke yep but the
challenge is okay so this is a
multi-part er in terms of the challenge
and it just keeps getting worse
first of all we can't use the Internet
that's enough right there which it
didn't even occur to me means no email
and no Google Maps both of those things
didn't initially click for me that was
that was a pretty big deal I treat email
like long text messages yeah like I
don't think of them as anything other
than straight utility like just part of
my life I think of Google Maps like GPS
yes I don't really think about obviously
it has traffic data and stuff included
in it but I never think like I am going
to use the internet to find my way to
this thing exactly I'd like to be clear
we're not stupid we understand that that
these services obviously the internet
yeah but it's just not something you
don't you think about yeah okay so it's
become so routine so anyways so yeah no
use of the internet no use of Google
Maps also no use of GPS so if your car
had a built-in GPS you can't do that
because that would have been unfair
because both cars didn't and not every
better GPS in their car and it somewhat
defeats the purpose
anyways of not being able to use the
Internet yeah so then there was the next
real challenge there was like there's
enough obscurity
there's enough difficulty already and
then colton on the day of i didn't know
this was coming it was like by the way
it's a best bang for your buck
competition there's no fixed price i
didn't know that either yeah so I knew
that the challenge was gonna be no
internet but it hadn't really occurred
to me what exactly that meant when I
heard that I was like oh yeah okay so I
can't Craigslist and I can't find people
online yes I didn't think about the
email part I didn't think about the maps
part yeah like when we were standing
there and I was thinking like how am I
gonna do this I immediately thought of
those things and best bang for the buck
challenges are in a lot of ways much
more difficult oh yeah than having a
fixed budget and trying to build the
best machine for that budget because all
of a sudden any strategy from $50 or all
the way up to $5,000 yeah has the
potential depending on the workload to
be the best bang for the buck yeah like
you could show up with literally
old tower from 2012 that you found in a
back alley for $0 and if it gets one FPS
in the game you have an infinity scholar
guaranteed to win you win yeah so it's
like the the best bang for your buck
challenge is enough in itself that was
season 3 yeah that was the competition
in season 3
then there's the no internet then
there's the no GPS it was intense so
we've got people Joey
Pomeroy asks when does this all air that
is a tremendous question so we've said
we're gonna do this before but this time
our sponsor is being super cool about it
and Dee brand has basically said yeah we
understand you guys want to do it up
right and so what we're going to do is
we are going to pre edit the entire
thing so that we can get all the pacing
right and then we've said this we've I
know we've said this multiple times yeah
but this time we're and you know what
every time we've gotten closer yes yeah
yeah like last time we storyboarded the
whole thing and edited at least more
than one and then I feel the editing on
season 4 was the best I still maintain
that I don't know what happened that
year so yeah so we are going to have the
whole thing pre-edited so we can make
sure the pacing of the season is right
and it actually should be a little bit
easier to get the pacing right because
one of the biggest criticisms that I
have as a viewer of scrap yard Wars is
that the first episode is always just us
typing on Craigslist and you're just
talking like mumbo-jumbo model number
number model blah blah blah
combine this with that trice whatever
yep whereas when you don't have the
internet you basically have to go we
both immediately started driving hoof it
yeah we we spent like a couple minutes i
sat with my head on my desk for a while
yeah and like I stood around for a sec
and then was like okay yeah I'm gonna go
here but like there was no googling
obviously or existing so I don't want to
spoil anything for you but you guys need
to watch this season
and I will I will tell you one thing
that I did I made a sign to go in the
back window of my car with my phone
number on it
your actual phone number that basically
said want to buy gaming computer did
anyone call SMS this number no ok so I
know I had that I didn't do so it's not
even a spoiler I guess was setting up
one of those signs and like sitting at a
bus loop this is the stuff we came down
to okay how's his heart how did people
find each other before the internet I
don't even know okay well I thought
about this but but you wouldn't do it
anymore but classifieds and stuff right
I
where would you find a newspaper that's
that's and like no one's gonna do that
anymore what kind of what kind of like a
technology savvy person would post
something in a newspaper so there yeah
there's really no point but like I think
that's what they would have done oh man
back in the day yeah so anyway it's
gonna be great um swamp meets I think oh
yeah but who runs a swap meet
from no I know I'm just a lot of these
things yeah yeah yeah I even thought of
like what if there's like a LAN party or
something and I could just go and like
buy a ticket and ask people if they want
to sell me their computer like adilyn I
got an offer to borrow one like I could
rent a computer from someone which
technically like is it against the
violates the spirit of the competition
exactly sure which is why I didn't do it
but like the guy was like yeah you could
like rent my computer and like direct it
for like a week and they just bring you
back there's technically no rule against
that but like no no okay one he knew me
I wouldn't hire either way so that it
was it was pre ixnay
but like while I was saying there I was
thinking like if he didn't like maybe I
could ask people I don't know
probably no one would do it I would
never even know that you rented it if
you were just like a good I got this for
10 bucks I'd have to be mad but like
well you watch the episode and figure it
out yeah I think I'd take back your
trophy yeah III think I think I would
take back your trophy if you won like
that that's not cool
yeah because I have been known to take
back a trophy you know if I feel like
how skeptical would you be they've been
missing I feel like you would have been
digging and figured it out on the spot
you know no I probably would have
believed you like you you've been you've
been honest with me over the years
no okay looks like a full it's probably
has LEDs in it hmm like it probably has
a window I'm renting a gaming tower from
s'okay right yeah no like I don't know I
would ask prying questions yeah be like
yes who did you get it from did they
know you where did you get can i buy one
of these now how many can we buy and
flip and make tell exactly exactly so oh
I think people are really confused so I
said if you won with that strategy I
don't take the trophy yeah yeah um all
right because if you we rent a computer
for $10 you're probably gonna win that
was like we would never spoil scrap yard
Wars you guys know scrap yard Wars is
like it's like sacred around here you do
not talk about scrap yard Wars outside
of the company to ensure even a lot of
people internally yeah don't know who
wins until the episodes come out so all
right did you want to do some like
actual tech news or something might as
well I guess so I mean we the people all
came all the way here from and you know
they clearly don't know where to get
their tech news because they haven't
already watched all of this I think yeah
so this was originally posted by I'm a
raised or on the forum and I think it's
just I'm Razer oh okay whatever
I'm the original article is from oops
properties deactivate activate there was
this no ties duplicate mmm maybe not oh
wait wait wait hold on hold on new idea
new ideas that even the right one block
them notifications alright um Intel
launches obtain dims so these are sort
of ddr4 sticks except they're only ddr4
in the sense that they fit in a ddr4
slot but they are not ddr4 because the
actual chips on them are not DRAM they
are not ddr4 it right that's interesting
so basically they're announcing the
availability but it's not like you can
actually buy one right now it looks like
they will be sampling these two they're
sampling them now and they will be
shipping them for revenue later this
year but only to select customers and
then broad availability is planned for
sometime in 2019 so in a nutshell are
actually let's go through some more
specs first so they'll be using obtain
DC / - sorry they'll be branded as
obtain DC persistent memory so that's
data center not direct current and this
is this is in contrast with obtain DC
SSDs so those would be like PCI Express
or in via me or whatever else
just regular SSDs I'm sure and they are
not to be confused with the
consumer-oriented obtain memory caching
SSDs that was such a terrible name for
that product like they should have just
called it like the obtain accelerator or
something yes obtain memory you
literally in the spot you just made a
far better name for it and you know what
the stupidest part of that is when I was
at their launch event when they were
launching op
memory they briefed us on this they knew
this was coming
they knew actual obtain on Adam for
servers was coming and they still called
the little MDOT to thing that
accelerates your hard drive Auto obtain
memory unbelievable Intel I love you
guys dearly but holy crap you sometimes
obviously contact one of the business
guys about having us help you with your
naming schemes yeah you know a new
business actually be really - media
group you know you know you know how
many people have asked me when we're
gonna do the next asus rog rig reboot do
you know where that name came from I
know this story but I'm gonna pretend
that I don't because it will work better
if you're telling me for the first time
so no wow you just completely you
completely ruined everything
I've never this is I'm so interested
where did where did our G rig reboot
come from okay so they originally when
we were when we were pitching this uh
they sent us what were that what were
the names that they they pitched us
because we were support it was really
are bad we were supposed to get back to
them light was over a span of weeks they
were because they pitched us a name and
we thought it was like really bad and or
generic that's a great picture
yeah which that should probably see that
picture
okay so just I have a really weird
relationship with my Asus rep I'm just
gonna see if they're so much on your
screen right now though uh is there
anything there is right there that right
there okay sit okay I got it yeah
anything in here no that should all be
fine okay yeah yeah I can show my screen
now okay so this is an email that he
sent to me we're kind of rethinking the
whole program at the moment so this was
when we weren't sure
we were gonna be working together on it
socks with sandals do not create the
branding image that we are after here
the whole neo chic glam southern surfer
rockabilly theme is great but come on
even the socks are white and so this is
a this is a tweet that we had sent out
around that time that is me in case you
guys are wondering so feeling a little
you know a little aroused it's totally
fine hot and heavy yeah yeah anyway so
they understand idea and I was super
busy and had no time to think about it
so Colton walked into me on my office
he's like look I'm not leaving your
office until you give me a name to give
them because job pool that's the last
thing holding up moving forward with
this project and so I'm like oh I don't
know maybe like ROG rig reboot and then
if they hate that like come back to me
literally on the spot we should offer us
naming things as a consulting fee based
like service to companies because
they're so bad at it
like did you know that Seagate's
rebranding for their drives you know
iron wall yeah and they still have
Barracuda
I like Skyhawk okay I like it too I
think they did a good job but get this
to come up with that scheme they hired
the person who did the color based
branding over at WD yeah they couldn't
just copy it it's not like there was a
it's not like there was any kind of you
know secret like they already had
Barracuda I'm calling just keep going
there's good it was cool okay swordfish
Drive sure shark don't know and like the
like Barracuda has like two kind of
steps to it so iron wolf makes sense why
did my shark is maybe a little bit too
sure you'd have to hire someone to come
up with that like I'm not trying to be a
jerk right again
Seagate my friends I'll everyone I've
ever met from seeking love you
dearly but holy crap what were we even
talking about I don't even know all
right obtain memory oh right right right
okay okay well no you never actually got
you said colton came into your office
right I just mean I came up with it on
the spot because I had no time to think
about it and within a minute or two it's
not like cold and stay there for a few
hours and now I get people like
messaging me or like walking up to me at
conventions being like I loved our og
rig reboot when are you gonna do that
again like like it's a thing now
[Laughter]
all right so opting from DC persistent
memory Oh initially available in a
hundred and twenty eight gigs just you
know I like how searchable that name is
256 and up to 512 gigs on a single
module yo dude you got crazy
OD CPM in your dog so the modules are
pin compatible with standard ddr4 DIMMs
and will be supported by Intel's next
generation Xeon server platforms so
whoever they are currently sampling
these things to apparently also have
Intel's next gen server stuff yeah so
that gives us some hints as to soon that
gives us some hints as to when we might
see those rolling out and broad
availability is planned for 2019 they're
not officially disclosing whether it
will be possible to mix and match DRAM
and obtain persistent memory on the same
memory controller channel and the 192
gigs of ram for the development preview
systems indicate that they are equipped
with a 16 gig DRAM dim on every memory
channel so maybe also not disclosed
power consumption clock speeds specific
endurance ratings other than them saying
that they should last for a similar
lifetime to the server with their
regular memory that's it so I actually
have to tag out with James but it's
gonna be probably a double swap I
actually I yes but first I would really
like to tell you guys about Oh
savage jerky so that I can eat
SATA is that okay can I do at least the
savage turkeys uh-oh I don't have my
notes because normally I load them up on
there they don't know this have a jerk
you know well basically a high quality
snack that's made with fresh ingredients
without nitrates or preservatives that's
not bad for you
they've got 13 different flavors of
drinks good I'm down alright 13
different flavors including my favorite
the maple buffalo bacon mmm
they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce
and a spice rub their Carolina Reaper
hot sauce uses one of the hottest
peppers in the world the Carolina Reaper
and I got to say you can use offer code
LTTE and save 10% let's have a jerky
calm but you probably shouldn't because
the more of it you eat the more you need
to keep ordering it I think I have a
problem okay I'm gonna let you do honey
and I'm gonna go and do one more video
but something super cool you ask you may
have some Alex you see what happens when
that is two pieces Wow Oh guys you're
right now there is see this is really
interesting because we're gonna be able
to open up the YouTube analytics and see
the drop off we'll be able to quantify
just like how much people hate James as
a code no slash love lioness or just
gotta get that laser James in their diet
okay
optic word spreads oh my god honey is a
free browse do I have a thing for this
there we go honey is a free browser
extension that automatically finds the
best coupons on the web so you always
get the best prices on everything you
buy online you know those like old
coupon websites where you like Google is
there a coupon for this website and you
find a whole bunch in the list and most
of them don't work and they're all
really annoying and bubble but it does
it all for you instead of having all

online retailers like eBay and Newegg

sweet then we have spectrum do you have
yours here yes anywhere but I like this
orange box oh let me try it
done you know where these ones yeah
these aren't gonna be for me these are
kind of those are a little bit they're
feminine
yes there we go staring at your monitor
all day can be hard on your eyes and
also make it tougher to fall asleep
that's the the latter note on that is my
least favorite part spectrum is an
affordable long-term solution to staring
at your computer screen or phone
actually as well using a software
solution like f.lux and twilight will
not give you the same type of filtering
that these glasses do features include
that they're stylish you might not like
these on me because I'm a very weird fit
for glasses but I think James looks
better in those ones and if I had
different ones they might look better or
you do like these on me who knows
they're also nice quality and have a
one-year warranty which is which is good
we've had these for over a year now I
think oh yeah and they look brand new so
yeah there I like how flexible and light
these puppies are boom they have low
color Distortion they block high-energy
blue light while keeping colors as
similar as possible so yeah that is a
thing any of these glasses will have a
very minor amount of color change and it
is this is pretty minor a little bit
noticeable but it is very minor I've had
two other ones that are a lot worse I
will tell you that much they're
primarily focused around Canadian US
markets but they are working on
expanding into Europe and they do offer
shipping internationally they also now
sell at Memory Express for Canadians
that's interesting month 11 oh that yeah
I had no idea get for that and for the
month of June they'll be offering 20%
off spectrum glasses check them out at
spectrum glasses comm slash collections
slash pro spec or prospect I think it's
pro spec or on memory Express or through
the link below if you're on youtube
today I didn't have the right banner up
I noticed you say coupon coupon I
suppose I say I'm a Coopers coupon
coupon I'm not seeing you're wrong it is
a you not a double O so coupon fun I
don't know I like okay we're gonna leave
this banner up for a little bit because
I forgot to put it up yeah before then I
have no idea what you guys have spoken
about so topics in a line definitely not
what definitely not that one what was
that one okay there was it's been
removed how long was it up there okay
let's let's explain school shooting game
on Steam has been removed rightfully so
in my opinion yeah
active shooter and Wow yeah straight up
an unreleased steam game in which you
play as a school shooter a SWAT team
member trying to neutralize them or a
civilian has been removed from the
platform and both the developer and
publisher revived games and acid
respectively
responsible for the game have been
banned from the platform the Games
trailer depicts a player running down
high school halls and through classrooms
indiscriminately murdering teachers
until a swap team shows up Wow
who how could you possibly think really
think it when they first were making the
game it was you couldn't play as the
school shooter you could only play as
the SWAT team person neutralizing them
it was just like a SWAT game with like
veiled and and that kind of
Aereo and then someone genius was like
you know how we can just use pill play
on the other side you be a terrorist in
counter-strike you gotta be a psychopath
like there's no amount of slimey there's
no amount of slimy greasy marketing like
whoa we'll get a lot of attention and
we'll make money there's no amount of
that that can motivate you to be bad in
sense what does Chad think what do you
think Chet well everyone can see sorry
whoa
intro no whoa it was scrolled I can
click on me sociopath how is this worse
than GTA very worse I would say it's
very worse very much worse do because in
my opinion in this one you are set up
specifically to do that in GTA it's it's
a choice yeah yeah well I mean you do
have to rip people out of their cars at
least you don't have to punch survival
sex workers or randomly shoot people
walking down the street you have a
choice and I guess arguably in this game
you don't have to play as the shooter
you could only neutralize them I suppose
the other thing is this is just so much
you can't shoot up schools I think in
the in fairness in this game you cannot
shoot children I don't even know if
there's children present it might only
be teachers but still this is just so
much more topical in GTA it's open-world
and like anything could happen it's
supposed to just simulate the amount of
variables that exist in the real world
whereas this is just specifically like
hey this tragedy that affects now
hundreds of families in the u.s. like
every week and it's like the greatest
tragedy that could happen really now
let's just do that
now the other argument here is that is
censorship
some people think steam should be
completely open for whatever some people
think this safe is too far I mean it's a
platform that they own this isn't a
government system so they can kind of do
whatever they want sure they can but
sure but what should their philosophies
ability yeah I mean that's up to them
like at the end of the day they're a
business if you don't like that they're
removing this go somewhere else well I
think they remove
in response I would cry because this is
I read about this topic was posted last
Saturday I believe on the forum
originally and then it's been updated
that they did respond I mean the
graphics of terrible was this even on
their radar it would have been one of
those brutal like no one knows about a
games that's what I'm talking about
maybe that's why they probably had no
clue it looks it looks like jock I don't
know personally but it looks like junk
some of the people most of people on the
game the forums so she's made for
outrage marketing by making a game with
stolen assets as a cheap cash grab maker
is banned because their record of making
stolen si games yeah so is just some
like junk game thrown together in no
time
yeah it wasn't on steams right and the
dude the publisher developer dude has a
history of customer abuse and publishing
copyright materials so and user review
of manipulation so he's just like so bad
but in the forums related to the game
some people mostly people were saying
get this game off of here off the
platform but some people were saying
that they criticized valve for the fact
that it gives the boot too many games
contain containing nudity while letting
the likes of active shooter state this
is prior to the bad people are saying
that it's kind of like a free the nipple
thing you're on Instagram and there's
you can be so scantily cloud and covered
in oil and putting your butt up against
camera but you can't be like
breastfeeding yeah I don't know it's I I
maintain to a certain degree that like
freedom of speech and whatnot is a
government based thing and it doesn't
apply to that platform if that platform
is like I don't want you shooting
teachers in a game they have full right
to take that off their platform if it
becomes discriminatory for some reason
then it's a different issue but I don't
think that's the case
valve seems to have known who this
person was pre-existing troll history of
manipulation and other things they
probably would have banned it just
because he's banned regardless I'm
pretty sure he was already banned and
just made a new thing to put this up
possible so like I it might not even
have to do with the game itself might
just have to do with the fact that they
don't want him releasing stuff on the
pop
here's a question for you you know how
ever since the first mass school
shooting Columbine people have been
blaming video games notably Grand Theft
Auto and music like Marilyn Manson music
and most gamers so many thousands of
gamers have been like look like games
are not the reason that these things are
happening well there's been studies that
have proved that too sure what about a
game like this do you think a game like
this that's so like it's a simulation of
of the event do you think that could
desensitize a person make them more
likely to carry out such a heinous crime
I think we're getting down a little bit
of a weird path here I I don't think
playing a video game facilitates doing a
crime because I don't think playing call
of duty inspires anyone to join the army
if that makes sense I think there are
some games that can do things like that
but like there's there's a video that I
like that's online that takes like a pro
counter-strike player and they give him
like the gun that he mains with and he
shoots one bullet and he's like I'm done
I didn't enjoy that I don't want to do
it anymore and just leaves so like it
doesn't necessarily inspire that I think
if you are interested in cars and then
start you can go are you waiting okay
all right
you can just there's no other way so
like I'm gonna block the camera what are
you thinking okay put your head a shake
man if you are already into cars and you
start playing like I don't know force a
force of five sure yeah it's that will
probably just drive that further drive
it'll steer you in that direction yeah
yeah yeah it'll it'll like it's already
a passion of yours so you're doing
something within that range and kind of
just accelerates it yeah yeah you're not
putting on the brakes no you're you're
trying to immerse yourself more in that
right and I don't think like maybe if
you're like obsessed with this stuff and
you're already watching like every new
poorly done news article where they talk
about the shooter a lot and they say his
name and all this kind of stuff and
you're like really really into
that type of thing and then you start
playing this game like it might be a
component sure well I'm not gonna be
like it's not the source there's I don't
think anyone's gonna play something like
I gotta go do it
like I don't I don't think that's gonna
happen I think you're already they
banned it yeah yeah cat now good yeah I
think if you're already obsessed with
the thing and already immersing yourself
in it so much it might be a component of
your insanity but like it's not do you
think there's any way that a game like
if you're a person like that that a game
like this could offer you release and
make you less likely I have no idea I am
NOT a psychologist probably varies
greatly between individuals yes it has
a lot of things do because people make
out our arguments like that for
prostitution like Facebook to remove the
trending topic I love it like you okay
all right all right sorry Facebook doing
something I don't even want to read that
topic and that's about all there is to
it they're removing the trending topic
sections the side of your newsfeed
they've got a couple of things there
that are trending hashtags usually their
news articles that are a few days behind
Twitter anyway and for like four years
that's been up there and people have
always been questioning how Facebook
chooses now they're just getting rid of
it all together and they are working on
some other some other types or ways of
delivering news to you including
breaking news labels and a section that
collects local stories do you have an
opinion on this thing with star citizen
and how you can get it you can buy this
pack of DLC that includes every item in
the game but that pack costs $27,000
yeah no I think spending $27,000 on a
game that doesn't have a like full
release date yet and might never fully
release is probably a solid investment
plan in the post Bitcoin boom
I like it so here's the thing because
this may be this may be a limited time
offer so you could spend 27 grand and
then sell those ships on the black
market
Wow and if you call in the next five
minutes you can have a dancing French
guy walk up under your camera yeah
shaking his butt in the screen Wow not
one but yeah Wow this is supposed to be
the least used set yeah so here's the
thing though I once I once around and I
was in Latvia and I had lunch with this
couple from California and they both
work in the mobile gaming space in
Silicon Valley
and the marketing end of it and they
were telling me they worked for games
like candy crush and they said that the
biggest percentage of money comes from
Wales it's it's like 99 yeah I guess so
much of it comes from Wales there's a
who spent over a hundred grand a year
the the the vast majority of your user
base in the mobile gaming space doesn't
matter at all
so if there's a Wade of taking money
from leveraging like the whales like do
you care who the this $27,000 is
equivalent worth to you and me like it
was like more less or less like it's
guys like a Saudi prince he's like oh I
can have all of them like cool boom done
the thing is though this isn't even
they're not even getting like unique
items it's not like you're getting a
one-of-a-kind no one else is getting
this ship only you have this ship it's
just always you just get everything and
everything in this case is 117 chips and
163 extras I'm not familiar with the
game with those extras be weapons
vehicles screens different guns
different modifications to the ships
literally a poster in your hangar mmm it
can be a lot of stuff lots of stuff
that's cool that's worth it I like a
little model of one of the ships that
goes digitally in your hangar in the
game like that that could be what it is
there's a lot of little extras this
game's a Kickstarter still it's not
outright this seems like a really good
way to fundraise from those whales get
the button get it
for the rest of but we were fundraising
in like what 2012 like what what year
did this start can I find the original
star citizen Kickstarter Kickstarter
star citizen October 18th of 2012 holy
cow
yeah I dude whoa this is like Duke Nukem
Forever status but they're still selling
stuff and they MIT they raised over two
million dollars originally make the game
they burned through it did they visits
over we need an estimated delivery
November - oh no hold on let's see one
more little detail here is that you
don't even have access to buying this
$27,000 pack of goodies unless you've
already spent a thousand bucks which is
so sweet you can't even view the page
that's awesome because it's adds this
exclusivity layer which I would imagine
is oh so tantalizing to the to the
whales who can afford this how much the
stars' isn't raised in 2018 we're
googling here SARS doesn't raise more
money than every other video game on
Kickstarter combined holy cow 2017 I
think this DLC pack has got to be the
most expensive game related content ever
chris Roberts collection of spacefaring
games raised thirty four point nine 1
million in 2017 like my god it's so
crazy stretch goals okay does it show
their total on here funding stats all
right
look at that eight whoa
well Leonard set hundred and seven
million dollar ah whoa what is that
other statistic says star citizen system
your people ears probably all time
probably doesn't include churn it's not
current yeah so what
there's two million people playing no
there's too many people that like have
accounts yeah I think it's doing people
that have paid some amount of money oh
wow that's my assumption so let me I
just want to make sure they're not like
procedurally generated citizens or
something no no no no no no no 187 that
is so much money how much okay here hold
on like like the Lottery's 30 million
usually well some are that big what are
you trying to find out how much money
would it take to so GTA 5 costs 265
million dollars so GTA 5 still cost a
bunch more but that's how much they've
crowd funded that's insane I wonder if
we could crowd fund a Falcon 9 rocket
so like just like guys you're all
against oh my god
okay across against humanity you know
they dug the hole no you didn't hear
about that no I know they had mailed
people poop and stuff he's human hole
cards against humanity' raises $100,000
to dig tremendous hole were they were
they allowed heavy equipment yeah I see
some heavy equipment in the picture it'd
be better if it was just shovels just a
bunch of people I heard of some dudes
who went to a party I don't know if it's
a grad party or what but they just
decided to dig and they they just spent
the whole party digging and in the
morning the whoever the host is just has
a giant hole in their backyard and
nested like show their parents oh my god
yeah they weren't invited that's
horrible okay so yeah so hole got dug is
apparently a holiday whole sorry holiday
whole calm was website dedicated
to the whole set up by cards against
humanity' and as long as money kept
coming in they would keep digging so
people had to live donate money and they
would keep digging well I got more
expensive or something well like they
could pre-purchase time uh and it got
more expensive over time and I
apparently they got $100,000 so if we
could get enough money for a falcon 9 to
just send like something stupid like
this like a car with a dummy a 10 or
something you know yeah I mean like
cards against humanity' should send like
an a-hole falcon 9 rocket like just
cards against humanity' cards into space
wow that should be their next establish
um shaped like a tree like it looks like
a tree it's made of tree parts holiday
rocket
there you go craziness immunity there it
is we should do well but we got it um I
think we should do one more okay all
right I'll allow it
a soos mining motherboard this thing is
actually pretty nut so you might as well
talk about that our source is field Jen
eg EJ wow that was a all right it's very
clearly a capital J I got what I said
the same thing though it's kind of like
a eg just kind of goes happens yeah I'm
okay I'm gonna show you guys this it
looks insane so I actually didn't know
so okay the first thing I look for is a
wall where you gonna put all the twenty
GPUs that it supports there's obviously
not slots for it but there's a bunch of
USB slots I didn't know that you guys
don't have that going over PCIe like
that yeah that's cool so the mining
stuff has a little a little tiny little
tiny card that you plug in that converts
to USB normally so they're just skipping
that step hmm so you don't have to have
the whole lane blocked out you just have
all these USB plugs you don't have to
worry about that step you still gonna
use B cable then that terminates back
into another thing and you're good to go
that's pretty cool it's a sweet-looking
board drifty nuts crazy ones a combining
master I don't know it says in the notes
I just
I'm lost here we will scroll down I
think I put on the bottom so I thought I
was boring it's just it's just
interesting it's one of the most
interesting looking boards I've ever
seen that's why I wanted to talk about
available in North America starting in
q3 look even look at the power dude 24
pin 24 pin 24 pin eight pin Wow
but does it have onboard Wi-Fi I did
notice that they still had their can you
guys see my mouse oh this one they still
have the like sound divider just in case
you want to listen to some Jam hell of a
sound card oh man on your 20 GPU mining
rig you just got a rock some ac/dc
you're just listening to white noise
heck yeah
okay are we good is that does that
conclude the land show oh my god it
feels weird cuz I feel like I had two
wine shows hmm like it feels like this
wine show was really short so I'm like
no I'm not done yet
oh I see you mean but like I think it
actually yeah I think we're I think
we're about good but thank you for
coming to the wine show the the
multi-part series alliances screwed up
his deep brand on this laptop but
anyways does your phone that is my phone
not a crack on screen it is well so yeah
oh sure I forgot that last time there we
go
I was going to do the intro tell you hey
well it's the intro and the outro
bad timing did you fart nope this is
cherry you know I wasn't talking with
the sound oh that sucks
savage jerky - spectrum is crap
honey honey oh it does kind of smoke a
prime I believe it jinyang</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
