brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with course our memory and
Western Digital guys we are here with
the hypothetical future of the desktop
gaming PC this is an undisclosed thing
that Razer has just unveiled here at CES
2014 they're calling it project
Christine and to even gaze upon it would
make anyone who is not a true disciple
of the all-mighty gaben wither and die
oh god I left this is it guys this is
the modular gaming PC concept it's not a
real product at all there are
engineering samples that probably don't
even look anything like this that are
somewhat working but this is and and the
end product might not look anything like
this but this is a concept for what
could be the truly easy to upgrade fully
modular silent yet powerful pcs so to
start with you have this base station
here so it's one single piece of
aluminum and I mean these guys are such
masters of industrial design I mean I
the only comparison that I've ever
really made in the past is to someone
like Apple they're kind of like the
Apple of PC to me which we absolutely
need and it is a thing of beauty so it
starts with the base station that then
all down the front and all down the back
it has these modules that can be
modularly unexpected right I know I'm
throwing you guys for a loop here that's
the most unexpected thing about this
video that can be modularly added and
subtracted to the middle tower so you
can see on the back we've got a
completely proprietary interface
although razer hasn't said that they're
a hundred percent clear about whether
they would make it an open standard for
others to create upgrade modules or not
maybe there'd be a certification process
but for now it's fully custom and
completely proprietary interface as well
as to quick disconnect fitting
so why would you need to quick
disconnect fittings and why is it so
quiet well because it is fully mineral
oil cooled so every one of these modules
on the back we've actually got GPU one
GPU to GPU three CPU memory as well as
rear i/o on here is mineral oil cooled
so the idea is that you would be able to
simply upgrade from single graphics to
sli by buying one of these modules and
plugging it into the back so you might
say okay Linus that's absolutely insane
that space-age we must be years away
from that and you know what the reality
is we probably are but they are
potentially working on it depending on
how much demand there is for this
technology so for those of you who are
you know excited about it please do post
comments on the video and let them know
that you love this and you want to see
it and for those of you who think it's
crazy go ahead and do that too but I
would ask you if they already somewhat
have it working and this is without
actually being close to a finished
product is it that crazy it uses PCI
Express for communication between the
different modules and between all the
different parts in some form wouldn't
necessarily work with exactly the
technology we have today as a finished
product no not necessarily but it's an
evolution of what the PC can be I mean
you look at what a high-end gaming PC is
now for someone like me I can upgrade a
graphics card in probably about 45
seconds if I only have one hand to use
but not everyone's like that not
everyone wants to open up their PC I
mean I've I I've encountered
professional gamers who need advice
about what antivirus to run or like how
do how to install a memory module so not
everyone's like that and that doesn't
mean that you're not an enthusiast and
you're not a gamer it just means you're
not necessarily a hardware guy so this
the idea is that it would completely
eliminate that uncertainty you would
just you would buy a new PSU and water
cooling module you would plug it into
the bottom and you'd have a silent
powerful new module that should be
forward compatible with everything else
in it
so the idea is that we'd be able to have
these systems last Oh
an entire sort of pci-express generation
rather than being tied down to a system
that's only upgradable within a single
CPU socket cycle or something like that
like it's all very again it's very
space-age I haven't even talked about
the front yet either
so I'm going to go ahead and turn this
baby back yeah I'm actually turning the
table it's not motorized we're not quite
that advanced although the PC is so
there's a blu-ray reader and writer here
there's also a control module here that
is you know very much a work in progress
but it has some cool video playback you
know you could probably have a
touchscreen on there control your fans
and all kinds of stuff like that we've
got a couple SSDs front i/o front audio
and then I don't know maybe this is a
speaker I don't know it can be anything
it can be what you want it to be but one
thing is for certain and that is that it
is modular that is the concept obviously
it's not a finished product I cannot
stress that enough it is easy to upgrade
in fact I mean this could open up
completely new business models such as
you could have a subscription-based PC
without being tied into something like a
cloud gaming solution where latency
might be a problem for you you could
just say okay I'm going to pay 30 bucks
a month and rather than leasing
something that I don't own maybe I just
have a subscription so you guys can keep
upgrading me and I don't even have to I
don't even have to read the latest
reviews necessarily I'll let someone and
whether it's razor or someone else if it
is an open standard I mean the sky's the
limit
maybe you just send me the new module I
pop it in I send the old one back and
it's off to the races
and then the last thing is that silence
and power is key and mineral oil cooling
in a consumer-grade
desktop machine is something that I'm
sure you don't have to be a hardware
enthusiast to kind of geek out over
thank you very much for checking out our
showcase of project Fiona did I say
Fiona because I meant Christine Fiona
was the edge tablet and it's funny that
I made that little Freudian slip there
because project Fiona was much like this
and that they showed off a completely
crazy thing and then they got such great
feedback that they made it so this is
kind of the same idea guys thank you for
checking out this video don't miss any
of our content from CES 2014 remember
our trip to the show is powered by NCI
XCOM your source for great technology
selection and service as
well as course our memory and Western
Digital big thanks to those guys because
we wouldn't even be here without them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
