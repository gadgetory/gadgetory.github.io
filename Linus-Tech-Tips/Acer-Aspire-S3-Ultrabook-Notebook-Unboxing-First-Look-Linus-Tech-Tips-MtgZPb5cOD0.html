from this generation of products
ultrabook unboxing this is for a sirs
aspire s3 so you can see the exact part
number we're looking at here we've also
got the specs here so it comes with
Windows 7 home premium this guy's got a
core i5 2467 and 13.3 inch screen with
LED backlight HD graphics
four gigs of memory 320 gig hard drive
card reader HD webcam three cell lithium
ion battery and Microsoft Office 2010
pre-loaded so pretty much what you'd
expect although I am really looking
forward to having a closer experience
with this particular ultra book then the
pictures that I have seen before now the
ones that I've already looked at are the
susan book and the apple macbook air the
key differences between those two are
obviously the operating system whereas
with the aspire s3 it has a distinct
similarity with the asus unit because it
is also a windows-based
ultrabook now this one came from Acer
this is a demo eval unit so you can see
that the seal was already broken on it
but let's see if we can still have a
fairly authentic unboxing experience and
it looks like we probably will okay so
here we will find the power adapter
which is pretty much what you've come to
expect fairly large size power plug
compared to the Zenbook from a soos very
reasonable sized actual brick in there
we find not a whole lot else let's take
out the note notebook I think they're
still called notebooks yeah and then
there's we've got some documentation as
well as your international travelers
warranty very very good to have pretty
much does it for accessories so it
doesn't include quite the same bells and
whistles like the carrying case that
comes with the Zen book but it's also I
don't think quite as bare-bones as the
Apple one because
at least comes with the international
warranty all right comes in a nice
little protective sleeve here and there
we are so the form factor is as you can
clearly see fairly similar to the other
two units but my sort of my feeling on
this one is that it feels a little bit
thicker but not actually any heavier
it's still a very comfortable sort of
design so here let's have a look at the
back so here we've got our rubber feet
plenty of attention to detail on the
bottom of the unit so nice finish which
is something that Apple kind of started
with their with their mac books and
painting attention to the bottom and not
just putting plastic all over it so Acer
has definitely gone with that for their
s3 unit we can also see it's got a nice
brushed finish on the top that looks
really good there's a couple
fingerprints on it from whoever was
using it before but what I'll do is
before I do my full video on my NCIX
channels I'll see if I can get them off
and that way I will know already before
I talk to you guys about it sort of more
formally how easy it is to remove
fingerprints from it because one of my
gripes about brushed metal finishes is
that they can be a bit of a bear to
remove fingerprints from in terms of the
overall keyboard layout we can see that
it's fairly standard we do have a
full-size shift full-size shift it's
plenty full-size backspace and we've got
a bit of a smaller knives oh ok slicks
hiding from the reflective screen so I'm
just gonna go like that so that he
doesn't have to do that okay and then
we've got an enter where we've put our
backslash above it I don't mind this
design because I very rarely hit this
part of the enter key in fact I'd say
never and this is the part that I
usually go for we've got our arrow keys
and their proper formation although
they're quite small but you shouldn't
use them too much and I love seeing
dedicated page up and page down keys in
a convenient location because think
about it actually look at how wide this
one opens check that out check out that
hinge so that's the maximum maximum
opening so this could be very easily
used for reading you know page up page
down you've got your buttons right here
right and then you've got it open pretty
much like like a newspaper or like a
magazine and yeah that's what that's
like
really outstanding now I'm not going to
be able to compare this to the other two
units very easily in terms of
performance because this is a hard drive
based model so it's a lower-priced model
but I just wanted to look at it in terms
of the form factor so why don't I just
grab the MacBook Air and let's just
compare them really quick because they
do have the same size screen similar
sort of battery specifications similar
CPU specs so there we have it so the
first thing there we are let's have a
look at the overall thickness here
because it seems to be I guess okay the
s3 is a little bit thicker so there yeah
my my gut feeling on that one was not
incorrect however what you guys will
probably notice is that at its thickest
point the MacBook Air is pretty much the
same and then once it tapers down that's
where the difference really comes in so
the Acer unit is more of more of a
consistent thickness throughout rather
than being really really thin at one end
and not that to the other so let's see
what that translates to in terms of i/o
so we've got our headphone port here
we've got that looks like for a carrying
strap although I really I really can't
imagine carrying around a laptop on a
wrist strap like that but if I know what
that looks like to you guys okay so yeah
Acer has any comments on that not much
on the front as we pretty much expect
and then on the other side we've got our
SD card reader and then on the back is
where we're gonna find the majority of
the i/o so we have our power input our
HDMI as well as our USB 2 ports and
finally our exhaust for the internal fan
so that's where Acer has really differed
from what their competitors are doing in
that they've instead of gone going with
a hinge design like this where the
entire back of the notebook is taken up
by the hinge they've gone with a hinge
design that feels very robust but still
allows all of these i/o options to be
built into the back let me have a look
here what else there is to say you know
what let's compare them in terms of the
size here so yes they're both 13.3 inch
notebooks but the Acer I'll check this
out the Acer probably due to that hinge
design is actually a little bit what
would you call that not wider that
shorter narrower sure let's call it
narrower so it's not quite as large as
the MacBook Air this way even though it
is a bit thicker so that's probably why
they weigh very similar even though the
MacBook Air is is significantly thinner
let me see so the touchpad is smaller
but I do see one major advantage on the
touchpad versus the Asus unit and that
is that it can be used at the very
bottom on the clicky spaces so you can
oh
pull it forward a bit push it down a bit
okay pop that one too
okay here we go so you can use the
bottom part of the touchpad in order to
navigate and then you can also click on
it the Asus unit actually cuts off about
here and is not sensitive on the parts
that are clickable so I would definitely
give a sort of big thumbs up for for
that particular design choice other than
that I don't see too much here to
mention so yeah I'll wait till I do my
NCIX video about it but yeah thanks for
checking out my unboxing of the Acer s3
Ultrabook so far this one's actually
looking really really sharp keyboard
feels good
form-factor feels good the weight feels
good build quality feels very good this
is a metal top so that's not like a
brushed plastic or anything like that
don't forget to subscribe so nice tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos okay select told
me what he wanted me to do when he was
sort of gesturing I mean he wanted me to
show the hinge comparison between the
MacBook Air which goes to here and the
s3 which goes to here that seems totally
insignificant at first but it comes down
to how you're gonna use it these things
are so light that you can carry them
around with one
and and like I was sort of saying before
like you can actually operate the
computer send me comfortably like this
so you grab it like this you go okay
yeah yeah page down page down I'm
reading oh I'm gonna fold it up when you
carry it around and just throw it you
know down the sleeve of my backpack or
whatever the case may be and I hey check
this out resume times even though it's
using a hard drive
tchau already open so we sell a bunch of
cars to last night okay I'm done
actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
