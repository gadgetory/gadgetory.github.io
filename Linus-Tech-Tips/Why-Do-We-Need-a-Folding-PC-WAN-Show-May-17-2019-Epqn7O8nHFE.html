gentlemen we've actually been streaming
for like the last three hours you know
that no I do but have we been like
crushing floatplane or has it been it's
been okay it's been okay yeah yeah
sort of yeah but okay is it is it like
can be right now I guess yeah neat um so
yeah what's gonna happen to that vaad
like can that go live can your new
transcode stack handle that we can it
can automatically uh-huh cool so yeah
you guys don't have a local recording do
we okay you could do so you can handle a
three-hour video Oh like how bad is that
gonna qual tears of thing so floatplane
a lot of people probably don't know this
what
flow planes transcode you know what I
think happens you leave the laptop there
and then you drift Oh cuz I want to send
her myself I think I finally figured it
out why you're always like five inches
too far that one anyway so floatplanes
transcode system used to be serial so
basically if Linus media group were to
upload a three-hour video tech deals or
bit wit could end up waiting literally
for hours while that all processes that
all the different at all the different
quality levels yeah that won't happen
anymore
so actually almost just as like a test
yeah I think you guys should upload the
local fog okay and we should just like
see how it goes sure cuz that would be
that would be good alright so we've got
a great show for you guys today I hope
James prepared it and then I actually
told him he didn't have time to prepare
the wine show anymore so we have
whatever he was done at that point okay
because we had to spend the entire day
building gaming rigs so you know the
land center yeah for unit 101 but so we
had no time to do it basically I've been
really frustrated because that project
has been sitting there for
weeks basically ready for us to just
like build it yeah but we just can't get
our act together and get it done because
they're quite complicated builds with
all the RGB and but I also thought you
had to go upstairs so we are gonna have
to move it upstairs but that doesn't
mean we can't build the systems okay and
once the systems are built yeah doesn't
mean we can't put them on a desk you
know so so we're putting them all on
desks and we're getting the whole thing
set up because I'm just tired of staring
at that and not being able to like play
games also we have a games night planned
for after work today yeah so we figured
we might as well play some video games
oh so we might as well go it was built
so we grabbed like literally half the
company Andy was a super champ and held
the camera for the entire three-hour
stream on an easy race okay Chrissy 200
not a red or C 300 whatever it is yeah
it was one of the cannons not a red yeah
so that helps but later did you build
though he's a super trooper so I built
one oh but here's the thing because they
were such complicated builds I only
built one and because we had helpers
like Dennis and Colton and nothing
against those guys they just don't build
computers very often don't work well no
one really screwed anything up super
royally okay yeah so there's so there's
that I just can't think of the last time
Dennis build a computer the last time
you built a computer was his editing
workstation yeah almost four years ago
ya know I dunno it was a bad it was a
bad scene yeah apparently Andy missed
lunch too yeah so so that's we're gonna
buy him dinner yeah yeah that's fair
yeah we'll buy him some dinner yeah you
can have a lunch voucher too I suppose I
could I could let that slide I think
anyway so sorry we've got a we've got a
hopefully great show for you guys today
yeah I get to do some backtracking
because I was rude last week the u.s.
bans huawei lenovo announced a folding
pc so that's interesting
don't be a hater we'll talk about I
haven't seen it yet but like okay
Microsoft Sony team up for game
streaming that's you know weird and
stuff and Supreme Court allows antitrust
lawsuit against the app store that's
actually a very interesting super which
john was here but in the media too we're
gonna have to roll the intro yeah
got some spawn sighs okay I don't know
why
that savage turkey got that PIH I am
gonna use the stream back look I used
the stream deck but then you put that
one up which yeah it's all good so you
guys might have noticed that luke and I
have adorable matching shirts today
this is the limited edition madrenas
roast shirt so it's a character of me
that Lloyd put together apparently
that's what he thinks I look like which
is I guess
so it's kind of a play on the the dog in
the burning buildings is fine yeah
that's what it says by the way yeah
you've got the LTTE coffee roast right
there along with a coffee cup some
flames in the background it's on LT t
store calm if you guys check it out yeah
there's not gonna be some slightly more
abstract LTT merch yeah I think we're
only doing a couple hundred of them
so okay yeah I like that
you guys sell these bottles now because
I know I bring the bottles up a lot on
the show but it's because now there's
always a tall thing of nice cold water
oh yeah all right so why don't we jump
right into our headline topic yeah that
was my new year's resolution a few weeks
ago Android authority says and this was
originally posted on the forum by Erica
s this is this is tremendous forget
about foldable phones here's the first
foldable PC and I really like this
headline because forget about foldable
phones is such a such an appropriate
thing to say given that Samsung is only
now getting to the point where they're
like re committing a ship date for the
Galaxy fold like that thing could have
ended up cancelled as far as I can tell
yeah so I know it's just
alright I don't okay I understand the
use case of foldable phones but I don't
think they're ready okay so like down
the line back us up here back
all right what's the use case of a
foldable phone for you I there are many
times where if I'm sitting stationary
somewhere for a while and I know I'm
gonna be waiting something waiting for
something for a while being able to fold
out a phone and having a big screen
would be cool okay
I could more easily use like Google
sheets which it's really heckuva but
yeah the chats all like F that was a
long freaking cut okay well at any rate
it seems like we're back and waitin for
YouTube yeah good Chad hasn't really
we're back ladies and gentleman back
there we go okay so you were talking
about how making your little thing
bigger is definitely a prime use case so
it's sometimes a utilitarian way of
story about things yeah so yeah I like
the idea of being able to expand my
phone because oh right I wanted to offer
a counterpoint for like working on a
long email so I actually hate typing on
a tablet and the reason is that I find
it's this super awkward
tweener size where it's not big enough
to type with all my hands but not small
enough to type with my thumbs
so I haven't actually used a galaxy fold
yet but what I want to know is if my
phone was double the width would I be
able to comfortably type on it I think I
could okay I can understand the but like
if I go to I can't really show that very
well but if I go to hands on this phone
like it's pretty cramped I'm faster at
typing on this one with one hand got it
okay so I I'm not sure because I haven't
done it that's pretty wide apart so it's
gonna come down to hand size and
dexterity alright it's okay okay so
you've got like I could see it I haven't
done it yet but I could see myself
liking a folding phone that's pretty
weird this is a better picture of it I
yeah I'm just gonna fire this up that's
pretty weird I I don't I'm not against
it I just don't understand yet I guess
okay like it's a tablet that you can go
like okay like why do I want that tile
to be around the corner I don't
I just I don't know I don't understand
the use case for it I am willing to
accept that I could just be blind yeah
but I've gotten stuff wrong
I got phablets wrong yeah I totally
missed the mark on that I was like this
is stupid anything bigger than the
iPhone 4 is dumb because you can't use
it with one hand and now even with my
small hands I'm a note user and like I
just I've learned to adjust my grip I
get my pinkie like way over here I get
this over here and then I get to get
that way reach across there like I'll
I'll be moving it around in my hand
actually drop it very rarely I don't
even use a case yeah I've been wondering
for a while if we're gonna evolve to
have like weighed more jacked pinkies
because there's so many people
supporting their phones like this with
all the weight of the phone almost all
the weight on the phone on there it has
to allow it like it has to select for
like breeding capability and I don't
think being buried in your phone with
like a super you know dexterous pinky is
gonna tinder efficiency so pinkies and
phones more agile probably a little bit
thinner less meaty thumbs that can dart
around faster yeah and like pinkies I
get a support wait so we can talk
through some of this now to be down here
what's really crazy about this is that
it's not just like a weird concept
product like this is a real thing it's
gonna be part of their thing pad x1
lineup it's got a 13.3 inch OLED display
from LG it's 2k resolution and a four by
three aspect ratio that is really
interesting it's pretty funky now with
so it's gonna have an Intel CPU they're
aiming for a full day battery with
support for cellular data making it kind
of like tablet II but it's gonna it
won't run Microsoft's OS which opens up
interesting possibilities for the
software it comes with a Wacom pen and a
separate keyboard so it's like more like
a folding tablet but like 13.3 inches is
really really big for
tablet yeah but also like pretty small
for laptop not definitely not unheard of
small there's tons of laptops in that in
that size range but that's on the
smaller stuff now one laptop running
actually like kind of a I would call it
a demo on top of Windows 10 that I saw
was a Seuss's dual screen laptop that
they showed off at Computex about a year
ago so I don't know if you ever saw this
I should actually I should bring up I
should bring up the video a sous do
little screen so a sous had some ideas
at the very least for what they thought
so this is just it but the screen
doesn't fold basically just hinge and
mute this okay so go ahead and full
screen this so it was like a Zen book on
the back there you go yeah at the bottom
and then it just had a normal laptop
hinge but both surfaces here were
screened so the idea was that you had a
touch-sensitive keyboard here I'm gonna
pause it this might be weird yeah I feel
like I would prefer that more I was
gonna say I think both of them are kind
of rough ideas I don't like it
like I'm just saying compared to the
other one if I have to pick one I'd
probably go with this one but I still
don't like it because the typing
experience is gonna be so bad and if I'm
gonna use my laptop instead of my phone
to be fair I might be watching something
but then I'm only gonna use one over the
screen here's the thing though people
who care about the typing experience
are they freaks is touch typing at a
hundred and thirty words per minute
going to go away auto correction is even
in like Gmail now yeah and all
form-filling Gmail with tab and like
pretty good the thing to me is that I
can usually unless it's completing a
particularly long phrase I can usually
type faster than I can read process and
go over to tab and then hold on a second
did it put punctuation in there or not
like kind of refined my way it's usually
faster for me to just type it out I'm a
pretty fast typist but
clearly that feature exists for a
freaking reason so are we gonna get to
the point where the vast majority of
what normal people would type just like
texts to friends and short emails and
stuff like that can just be heavily
assisted to the point where the keyboard
becomes far less important than having
more screen space to multitask could
that happen I wonder if this is gonna be
my old grouchy guy that doesn't like new
technology thing is I don't like touch
interfaces right the phone I'm okay with
the phones fine anything outside of
phone I hate like if you have like a
microwave or a washing machine or DSLR
camera if it's a touch interface I'm
probably not gonna like it
so is touch-typing going to become like
an equivalent of shorthand we're like
the advent of typing really made
shorthand notation kind of irrelevant
yeah and I wonder if like if the
Google's Gmail thing and whatever else
that they're doing where it
autocompletes on tab is gonna get even
stronger and it's gonna get to the point
where because this happens with texting
a little bit like I can text without
looking at my phone because I know if I
butcher a word and like miss type half
the letters it's still gonna get it so
like does it even really you can just
type three letters per word well here's
something one of typing in the future is
going to turn into typing half of the
word every time Microsoft own Swift key
so there's no reason why a Windows
device like this couldn't take full
advantage of Swift keys from my
experience very nicely predictive
texting yeah we got stereo sensation
backing us up here he'll know we typed
code over here WTF yeah okay some people
are always going to need to actually
type the whole thing because if you let
your autocomplete like it's you know
okay so autocomplete like just like
sentences and having a conversation
that's just like full autocomplete
that's pretty funny an autocomplete
program what
you're gonna end up with flop plane flop
just like that it doesn't fly it just
like kind of hops along in the trees
right hoppy plane that would be an
amazing like the whole site just like
goes but it's just floppy plane
I know Jaden could do it for a fact
right because he basically has done it
right yeah why didn't we come up with
this Rasmus here I don't think we had
enough time by the time we realized
April Fool's is coming up floppy plane
Oh
so anyway back to lenovo's device some
press outlets did get hands-on with it
and based on their impressions with a
functional prototype the display was dim
and had poor viewing angles and so this
has to be to do with making it foldable
because this is the first LG foldable
OLED that I'm aware of
mm-hmm as far as I know Samsung is using
their own display and actually don't
quote me on this I'm actually not a
hundred percent sure who was using for
the made X huawei mate X OLED I know
there's autocomplete and programming I
know there's actually a fair amount of
it especially when putting in variables
and stuff like that we're talking about
like whole sentences and stuff the Gmail
style autocomplete that I'm talking
about is punctuation full sense yes
situation okay so they're apparently
sourcing from boe display so not LG so
this is the first foldable LG OLED that
I'm aware of on a production device and
to be clear to prototype not a
production device but it's possible
because like I know LG's OLED can be
pretty freakin good from their phones
from their TVs but what we don't know is
what their process is for putting their
foldable display materials on or excuse
me their OLED display on like some type
of a foldable glass or plastic plastic
so
I'm out I'm out personally but then we
shark tanking this night II guess so I
might end up eating my words because I
was wrong about phablets now husband and
absolutely I'm in on phones
I just I'm they're not ready yet so I'm
not doing it because I need my phone to
be primo all the time
phablets have been a huge tech trend
that I got completely wrong like far
more wrong than I think I've been about
almost anything since founding Linus
Media Group like VR AR I was like I know
you mean that but it's like Oh like it's
know that it sounds like you were very
very wrong about founding my no I'm
still I'm still behind that idea I'm
pretty stoked on that yeah and
floatplane might even be okay to one day
yeah we'll get there one day
yeah but but no I was completely wrong
about that so ever since that I've been
I've been a little more hesitant to kind
of say this is a terrible trend
manufacturers need to cut this out and
actually as part of my sort of recent
attempt to be a little bit less just
hateful I guess and like really negative
okay I ended up taking a lot of flack on
the 1 + 7 Pro video so you were - not
hateful Wow at the beginning of the
video I basically come out and I say
here's everything that's wrong with the
1 + 7 Pro and I say it doesn't have
waterproofness it doesn't have a
waterproof certification so my
understanding has actually cost a
significant amount of money to get that
IP rating on the product and you can
make a product that is perfectly
waterproof and just not submit resistant
resistant thank you and just not submit
it and then it will just be that but
there's no label we're sure the price
has even gone up with the amount of how
important a feature it is yeah yeah it's
become a much more popular feature on a
range of devices these days so we know
ready from our tour of one-plus factory
that they do make efforts to make their
devices water-resistant they just don't
pay for the certification so I called
out that it didn't have that
certification doesn't have wireless
charging which for a lot of you
shouldn't get them to do that you should
get them to partner up with you to do a
project and give you like a whole bunch
of phones and get like Alex and James or
something to rig up a system that like
dunks them on timers we create our own
like cheaper certification of like l-l
IP yeah I'd be I'd be interested in I
don't know if I'd actually make a real
certification for it but like I'd be
interested in seeing you guys do the
testing that would be kind of fun
actually anyway where was I going with
this right so then the other thing that
I criticized was the lack of a headphone
jack so I said this is all the negative
things about it this and then I said but
I'm not gonna harp on that too much
because most the vast majority of
flagship phones these days don't have a
headphone jack and I got a lot of flack
for not like hating on it enough and
here's the thing guys I am NOT giving up
my headphone jack anytime soon which is
a big part of the reason that in spite
of how much I love the 1 plus 7 Pro and
the performance that it gives this is
back in my pocket you have Samsung Note
9 got that headphone jack got that
wireless charging got that everything
this phone just like I love this phone
to be honest with you it doesn't have
the greatest camera I accept that
Samsung's OS quite frankly is just not
as snappy as oneplus as oxygen OS but
I'm willing to accept that because I use
the stylus once in a while now I never
thought I'd care I don't think I've ever
seen you use a stylus I I use it very
occasionally so like when I was going to
Ikea a few weekends ago I took a picture
of my Smokies popped out the stylist
wrote all the measurements on my picture
and then I had that as a reference when
I was at the store cool you can do it
with your finger but it's harder
that was actually why I was a little bit
a little bit longer ago while I was
reviewing me
10-plus so I was like trying to do it
the s10 I was like this is annoying I'm
gonna go grab my note 9 and just do it
on the note because it's easier yeah so
so there you go
stylus anyway what do you what do you
think about the 3a having a headphone
jack and 3x oh I'm annoyed that
headphone jacks are being treated like a
budget feature like you couldn't afford
wireless earphones yeah so you need a
headphone jack because a lot of more
premium audio experiences or wired do
rely on the headphone jack exactly so
the thing though is that this is a trend
that I personally thought was very
obvious as soon as Apple removed the
headphone jack I was like this is
terrible this is a terrible trend this
needs to not happen and I remember
having a very enlightening conversation
every once in a while it's good to talk
to a normal person like like a not techy
person yeah and so I was chatting with
the guy that runs the Badminton Center
that I usually hang out at and I was
like yo so you got the iPhone 7 sup
how's that going and he's like yeah I
love it and I'm like doesn't have a
headphone jack
he's like oh yeah I was like is that
gonna be a problem for you and he's like
are you kidding me I switched to
Bluetooth earphones like two years ago
and he uses de birds and he's like I
haven't I haven't plugged anything to a
headphone jack in years and I was like
oh oh and I was like but those don't
sound very good
he's like I'm good enough for me but you
have to charge them it's like yeah I
gotta charge my phone too I'm trying to
catch you on something here I love to
picked on yeah she's never worn
headphones in her life oh well alright
so what I have to kind of accept here
and what I have to hope for I have to
accept that needing wired headphones is
becoming more and more niche as time
passes and what I have to hope is that
someone is going
to carry the torch LG seems pretty
committed to it still but here's the
thing their mobile handset division is
really struggling
so clearly this this this group of
people that's like yeah headphone jack
Rob Rob Rob I'm gonna buy folks
headphone jacks boom he's clearly not
enough to you know keep LG alive that is
unless Samsung ditches it and all those
people do actually move over to LG so
we'll see if that happens but in the
meantime I'm still really sincerely
hoping that Samsung is going to continue
to support the headphone jack I don't I
don't know if I don't know if I don't
know if I am putting my faith in the
wrong place but that's that's all I
really have because who else hasn't
ditched it yet
you got LG you got Samsung I mean Google
brought it back with the three a that
would be an amazing thing for Google to
bring back with the pixel four I'd be so
stoked I would switch to the pixel four
because we would surely be rid of the
knotch by then nachos were a stupid
horrible trend
I have never daily driven a notched
phone and I will never do it because
full screen display tower full display
screens are here now full display
screens full what do we call them
whatever all display phones yeah
full frontal thank you all display
phones are already here and there's
great ones like the 1 + 7 Pro if you're
into that like the Galaxy Note 9 which
okay fine it isn't full but whatever
this strip at the top you weren't going
to use it anyway feel a little bit yeah
like we have massive display phones
already there's no reason to use an
arched phone in my opinion so I just
hope that I have some kind of an option
a pixel 4 with a headphone jack and no
not would be my phone quite honestly
yeah I'd do it I'd give up the stylus
I'd give up the stylus that I use like
once a month it doesn't sound like a
huge sacrifice
I also like scribbling on screenshots
with it so I oh oh I've been hosted
finger that
yeah it's harder like this one
right here so I posted on Twitter
earlier this week with a screenshot of
the monetization tab in the YouTube
dashboard for the roast how far back
does this go a lot of tweets miss a
while ago oh yeah there it is oh yeah
okay okay so I'm like I got like my
thumbs up I'm circling stuff drawing
faces it really is a lot easier to do
with the stylus sorry it looks kind of
like that also I have an update on that
so the video does actually have some
adsense revenue now which is pretty cool
but earlier today we got a yellow icon
yellow icon baby there it is you guys
can't see it whatever it's the it can't
be too surprised with that one I'm not I
mean we self-reported that it contains
strong language and all that kind of
stuff so it is what it is yeah but yep
we are not we are not going to be making
up the shortfall in our budgeting for
that with the yellow icon to be clear
madrenas held up their end of the
bargain we just blew a lot more money on
the event than we had originally planned
like flying people out to attend it and
all that kind of stuff so it is what it
is we had a lot of fun buy a shirt there
pretty cool if I could say so myself
yeah I think they're pretty smashing you
know what I got a wonder there's 8,000
people watching the wind show now how
many of them have been watching us just
don't like YouTube for hours today you
know what I want to stop all this can
you can you straw pull this up Josh
bowling pcs ah like okay right so back
to the headphone thing the reason so I
took a bunch of I took a bunch of flack
for this in the 7 Pro review and the
reason that I had hedged my bets was I
didn't want to like I didn't want to
pick that hill that I'm dying on again
and turned out to be wrong especially
for my experience talking to normal
people who just plain don't care yeah
okay one quick thing do we want to make
this a poll just about folding pcs or
should we ask about folding phones as
well no holding phones are happening
okay that's like there's no question so
we want to know are we missing the mark
on folding pcs is that going to be a
thing
or do we already have pcs that fold
exactly as much as they need to with a
proper clamshell that contains a proper
keyboard and at worst a trackpad so
Luke's gonna fire that up I'm gonna go
ahead and get into our sponsors while we

lunch today I'm salivating so hard right
now I'm so excited
they got me mine I love this savage

that without nitrates or preservatives
that's full of flavor but that isn't bad
for you we've got 13 different flavors
of jerky like the sriracha bacon and
maple buffalo bacon they also make
barbecue sauce
dude a barbecue sauce on pasta I've
asked you this before Jessie barbecue

not yet you should try it yeah like
actually had passed recently just
completely forgot like six drops of the
forget if it's the ghost pepper one that
I've been really enjoying lately so I
think the ghost pepper one or the reaper

into it absolutely love it um anyway the
Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of
the hottest peppers

can use offer code LTT to save 10%
that's average jerky dot-com we also
have a new sponsor today so I'm gonna
have to read these labels hmm this is
the hive Luke or the Dover for these hmm
okay oh the box is apparently engraved
Wow okay so your watches so they're best
known for their wood designs but they're
continuing to expand their boundaries to
include other natural elements such as
two of them what's that one made of
apparently they have marble watches as
well these are these all appear to be
wood designs they have a huge selection
and the ability to personalize makes
you're at a great place to go for gifts
for Dad oh yeah father's turning up that
makes sense right okay cool
actually this is funny a lot of people
have noticed I've been wearing the
Galaxy watch yeah you notice anything
about it oh it's dead so my goal is
actually to wear this watch continuously
for a month not because I actually like
it but because I'm trying to make a
point about smart watches in general I'm
really unhappy with the state of them so
I'm going to review this after having
not charged it for a month and I'm gonna
review it in the context of how my life
really didn't change because it was so
worthless already anyway I really really
don't like the Smart Watch then maybe I
might just go back to a dumb watch
anyway I'm gonna throw this on because
they're not dumb George watch I got to
tell you guys about George Rogers right
now Georgia yards probably yours George
my bad anyway so they've got a huge
section and the ability to personalize
to make yard a great place for a gift
for Dad Father's Day is coming up so
they've got personalized engraving
available in the watches as well as
their cedar humidor boxes they've got a
generous return in exchange policy free
worldwide shipping and a great warranty
so I use offer code ltte 19 to get there
we go
ltte 19 to get $25 off and free sizing
at LM GG g / yard LT t so this one
one's really cool are you wearing the
same one as me right now weird like
cellphones oh yeah yeah this is one of
those yeah have movement wound ones and
you can actually see the mechanism
inside it I'm fine
should be showing this to you guys but I
don't know if yours has really cool and
mine it's a little hard to see for the
camera oh there there you go you can
actually see it moving around there so
that's pretty cool back and through the
front it passes through completely you
can feel the momentum swing a little bit
that's actually really cool yeah that's
also your watches check them out more
details at the link in the video
description alright so we've got a few
more things to cover for land show here
Oh first of all I want to jump in and
apologize to folks with autism spectrum
disorder so I had said last week that
Asperger's is no longer considered its
own diagnosis but I made it seem as
though being a high-functioning person
on the autism spectrum is not valid so
the way that Asperger's was changed is
such that it isn't its own discrete
diagnosis anymore but that doesn't mean
that it is not still classified as sort
of a high-functioning part of the autism
spectrum okay so some people were upset
because they felt like I was making it
sound like Asperger's wasn't a thing
it's still a thing it just doesn't have
the same label because it's just
considered part of the autism spectrum
now right some people were also upset
because I had said we're all kind of on
the autism spectrum what I had intended
to say by that was that everyone feels
that way sometimes but yes they made an
excellent point that autism is
considered an excessive amount of that
kind of feeling or those kinds of
behaviors and so some people were
emailed me and were pretty upset because
they were like look it's hard enough as
sort of a high-functioning person with
autism to explain to people that no it's
not the same as just being shy and so I
felt like that was a very fair thing to
bring up with me and I should probably
clarify it on the show this week will
make sense so there you go in other news
this is from Sen pecan Orange
depending on who you prefer the us been
oh no let's get back to oh let's get
back to our survey first so Luke screen
mm-hmm are we missing the mark unfolding
pcs I love your options 774 of you say
no they are exactly as trash as you
think and 18% say yes they're gonna be
massive
you really didn't leave a lot of room
for middle some people pointed out that
there wasn't a middle answer I did that
on purpose as I guess if you're gonna be
a futurist with a crystal ball you got a
pick yeah
you like being wishy-washy and be like
oh they might be neat you could classify
almost anything as nice as long as the
company keeps making it like it sits are
they gonna make it or know it yeah I
don't know this is a giant piece of
bacon there's a massive piece I'm gonna
put it in my mouth hole
oh my okay I'll be jumping to us Ben's
Huawei chair oh boy so the US Commerce
Department has added Huawei and 70
affiliates whoa 72 it's entity list that
bans the telecom giant from buying parts
and components from US companies without
US government approval also known as
just know it also makes it difficult to
it also makes it difficult if not
impossible for a while way to sell some
products because of its reliance on us
suppliers if they don't think this is
gonna come back to bite them I don't
know man
so I feel I feel like quite a few US
manufacturers are gonna get wrecked
because of this because it's it's just
gonna this is just a punch for punch I
for I trade war that's been going on
with US and China and Canada to a
certain degree I mean we're not gonna
get too political cuz that's not really
our jam on this sugar but can I just
sort can we have like a stupid people
debate right now the concern with Huawei
is that it provides a backdoor into
China and while my understanding is that
per tick
there-there carrier-grade like their
backhaul great equipment has never
actually been demonstrated to do that
send data back to China yeah it has been
noted that it's not particularly well
coded so that's one thing and the main
concern seems to be that Huawei has
essentially a state-run company as many
of them are over in China would be at
the mercy of the Chinese government add
such functionality in the future should
they decide that they require it so
that's to be the concern another major
concern I've heard again not should I
get political just talking about things
I have heard on the interwebs is
Killswitch stuff if there was to be a
conflict of some sort mm-hmm and you
could just turn off the other person's
communications or a significant part of
it I know there's other layers and stuff
but if you could turn off a significant
part of the communications that would be
a pretty big deal okay so that seems to
be like the major concern with using
Huawei communication far as I know yes
okay so can I can I propose an
alternative viewpoint mm-hmm why should
anyone else be comfortable using
American equipment or anyone else's
equipment for that matter no
particularly American equipment is
China's record for spying on its
citizens that much worse I don't know I
don't know I don't know I have no idea
no clue to be clear as far as knowledge
yes it is worse but as a foreign
national so I'm neither Chinese nor
American should I be comfortable with
either of these options
anyway so US President Donald Trump back
to the decision saying it will prevent
American sorta chatter Luke prevent
American technology from being used by
four known entities in ways that will
potentially undermine US national
security or foreign policy interests so
separately the President signed an
executive order declaring a national
emergency barring the use of
telecommunications equipment made by
companies that are deemed to be a threat
to national security didn't in China or
Chinese companies specifically but this
clears the way for an outright ban on
products made by Huawei Huawei has said
this decision is in no one's interest
which and it will do significant
economic harm to the American companies
with which Huawei does business affect
tens of thousands of American jobs and
disrupt the current collaboration and
mutual trust that exists on the global
supply chain powerpoints probably to go
back to your should you trust him trust
American ones either and to tie back
into my can you trust anyone's
thingamajigger sure especially if you're
just a civilian
chillin talking to your buds if you're
you probably shouldn't trust these
communication layers super deeply at all
regardless of who's running some of the
backend hardware because of how easy it
is to spy on and tap in on these things
it's your computer or your phone or
something in between so we've got people
saying that the reason you should hold
on there's due process in America versus
China it's a different story the
government having a stake in the company
all this kind of stuff I mean the thing
is remember you don't really need a
stake in the company to force it to
comply to your laws and while there's
always sort of the way that things are
done traditionally during peacetime
there's a lot of emerge
see powers that can be exercised by the
American government as well in the event
of like declaring a national emergency
or declaring war or whatever the case
may be like if you ever kind of read
into that stuff it's actually kind of
scary the way that they can just kind of
like take land and use it for stuff and
everything yeah so yeah III don't know
property is in everything including not
land to be clear I don't actually
believe that the American government is
on China's level when it comes to the
the monitoring of its population I don't
think they're there I don't thought
they're likely to catch up but there's
well documented cases of Funkytown stuff
that has happened so including in Canada
if you want to hear something really
neato about Canada look up the Canadian
spy palace that's like actually what
it's called you know it's uh should I
trust Canadian telecoms equipment we
have a spy palace who knows yeah I don't
know if it doesn't look like the
fortress of solitude I'm gonna be
disappointed it's actually like quite
stunning it's really it's a really
beautiful building actually I'm looking
it up yeah spy palace its massive and
cost an insane amount of money to a
Canadian scale experience this together
spy palace Canada Canada's top secret
billion-dollar spy anytime you'd be seen
billion dollar and Canada are involved
it's like whoo yeah that's inside yeah
that's the spy palace yeah money fat
stacks
well actually tax dollars hard it what
do we spend Canada's money on spy palace
what up billions of dollars really fancy
staircase screw these citizens let's
talk about the Supreme Court allowing
the antitrust lawsuit against the app
store so this is okay I wish we had John
here because he was gonna talk to about
me stay legal stuff but there are few
thing
I dunno so one is that this doesn't mean
that Apple has been found guilty or that
they they have to open up alternate app
stores for on the iPhone or anything
like that all it means is that the
Supreme Court voted five to four on
Monday to allow the antitrust lawsuit to
proceed so it hasn't been won yet and
basically the lawsuit is this they're
accusing Apple of maintaining a monopoly
on iOS apps via the App Store now this
case was dismissed back in 2013 but the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
allowed it to return in 2017 and Apple's
pushback brought it to the Supreme Court
though only to decide whether it can
continue not the final outcome so it's
related to a 2011 case arguing that with
the App Store being the only place for
iOS downloads you're stuck with
artificially inflated prices which is a
pretty valid point with that said Apple
argues that developers set the prices
and that it's not in violation of any
antitrust laws so by paying its
Commission developers are buying a
package of services which include
distribution and software and
intellectual property and testing now
with that said they are obviously
maintaining a monopoly and they are
setting the pricing of the distribution
of software and intellectual property
and testing bla bla bla bla bla and
apples price is thirty percent which is
not insignificant and a hundred dollars
a year oh yeah I guess we're launching
an iOS app soon I mean yeah so did we
pay that already or is that just coming
soon the hundred dollars yeah
technically it hasn't been paid yet but
it will be very soon neat
oh yeah floatplanes launching it out
soon yeah hey so and they called me
already and like things are moving
forward so it should be ready a lot
faster than we suspected so if Apple
loses the case it might be forced to not
only allow third-party app stores but to
pay up to triple in damages as a
deterrent okay so this is a good thing I
have a question I don't know legal stuff
I don't think either of us do so be
ready for a whole bunch of ignorance to
come out of my mouth but they're
essentially a marketplace right
so put in the marketplace mm-hmm could
someone get mad at us and say that we
have a monopoly on floatplane creators
be able to join the platform and say
that someone else should be able to run
a Marketplace on floatplane as far as I
know no but I think that you would have
a harder time because they sell the
phone so the thing is that flow plane
has competitors like theirs Android so
yes there's Android but I think once you
reach a certain scale there the way that
antitrust laws work is that you're not
allowed to monopolize like anything
that's too big and so I think you could
probably make the argument that iOS
users are kind of their own jam now
that's obviously part of the argument
that's gonna be made but I think Apple
is gonna come back and say well yeah you
could just buy an Android phone yeah
okay okay yeah so you could go after us
for that but you'd get rekt because
there's many competitors and for them
like leaving the ecosystem of iOS is
probably so difficult that you might be
able to argue in damaging and damaging
they may be also argue that it's a
monopolize review okay interesting
I think what do you think this would
actually be pre damaging to the
appearance of iOS and Apple personally I
think that this would be damaging to the
iOS ecosystem in general
I absolutely fully support Apple
maintaining their lock down on the App
Store to be perfectly honest it might
not be a popular view it's been very
annoying for us trying to get on to it
because it takes a lot longer getting on
to the Google store is like oh you got
an app yeah put it on the truck cool
you're in iOS store there's you have to
go through this lengthy application
process and then when you go to upload
your app they have to review it for a
long time in buh-buh-buh but it lines up
with the clean and pristine kind of idea
that iOS and Apple is and has so I don't
know so yeah this is really good from
laser bolt monopoly doesn't necessarily
mean there's only one company it just
means they could
scroll the market someone brought up in
here yeah is the PlayStation online
store monopoly maybe
so if Apple loses this and maybe so this
is really interesting this has a huge
impact for for software marketplaces
everywhere now I would say steam is not
especially now I mean five years ago who
maybe but right now steam is not a
monopoly because game developers can go
to you play or they can go to epic game
store
I know it sorry I can go to you play
they can go to epic game store though
they go do you play did you play take
third-party oh I don't know yeah origin
does okay it's pretty clear steam is not
a monopoly but there are definitely
situations like the PlayStation where
that would be a very very similar
situation Nintendo to Nintendo is such a
walled garden yeah people that some
people are saying you can buy
PlayStation keys from elsewhere you
still have to use the store so does it
matter maybe it does matter I'm not sure
I don't know maybe that'll be maybe
Sony's lawyers thought that that was
enough a good protection for this I
don't know cuz this has clearly been
going on for eight years now yeah yeah
whole thing's really interesting I don't
know anything about legal stuff alright
so I think it's time for me to go play
some video games are you staying for
tonight yeah
oh nice okay well yeah but we should
definitely talk about some LTX stuff
also
ltte store calm oh wait no water bottles
i think are out of stock but hats hats
yeah yeah yeah cuz john was wearing one
so the hats are pretty nice well yeah
ltte what's really cool and i'm sure
some people are gonna actually don't
wear hats this way I usually wear them
like this but because I'm an idiot
deal with it so it keeps my neck from
getting burned oh yeah anyway so these
were to keep this under these are one of
the first merch items we've ever done
civically designed to not have - tech
tips on it anywhere hero out some of you
feel better yeah - tech tips is not on
this and the reason for that is that
LTTE is gonna sort of be becoming its
own brand oh yeah
so we just you interest we want the
merge like aside from stuff like this
that's like clearly commemorative of
like a video
aside from stuff like this we want the
merch to just be stuff that you might
actually want to wear yeah actually
wanna like use yeah so we're gonna start
to do a little bit more stealthy stuff
like this so this is the first okay I
think that makes sense or if you want to
wear a hat that like just kind of looks
cool cuz with this if someone doesn't
know that this means line effectives
they're not probably gonna worry about
it yeah they just won't care yeah
whatever he's wearing a hat we've had a
lot of people ask for a black one with
orange LTTE that will come at some point
the reason that we did it this way was
that we really couldn't get the orange
right it didn't look good so we are
sticking with we're sticking with the
single color ones for now so it's blue
black blue and we debated this earlier
is this maroon or burgundy I don't know
what marine looks like alright I'm gonna
vote with Burgundy everyone said
burgundy so I'm assuming you said marine
I did but I forget what maroon looks
like I think it's more Brown I think
it's more pertinent I think I was wrong
um so ltte store.com we also need to
what's up what's up oh yeah that wasn't
that far off that's kind of maroon e
what's burgundy hey hold on we gotta get
Luke screen on over here so Luke's
looking looking that's maroon in the in
the corner honey you're on a razor blade
stealth so like who knows what it
actually looks like ah that's pretty
burgundy if that tie this be ads these
are all different color whatever I'm not
even mad okay let's see if we have an
