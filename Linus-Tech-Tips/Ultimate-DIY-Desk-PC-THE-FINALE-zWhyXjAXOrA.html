conclusion the culmination of like
months of plans and hard work
DIY desk PC will be complete before this
video is over so don't go anywhere
to begin with honestly all I could
really do was stand around and gather my
thoughts for a few minutes I
legitimately like really have no idea
where to start
between my dad's heart surgery and
Jake's school schedule it had been so
long since I touched this project that I
wasn't sure where half the tools
materials or even computer components
were so a little mental and physical
organization was in order first up was
the final installation of the
motherboard inserts I had pre done some
of these and then put in screws so that
I could paint over them and I really
wish I had done them all this way it is
much scarier mashing away at a finished
product with a hammer than an
in-progress one the power button was a
piece of cake using a couple of cable
mod extensions that we spliced together
and then it was time to start on the
hardware naturally of course we've gone
with a nickel-plated ek supremacy Evo on
a top-of-the-line core i7 Xtreme 69 50x
call it what you will deca core 10 core
I call it nothing but the best my
friends and in that vein we've gone with
two kits of Corsairs Dominator platinum
special edition memory which was limited
to only 500 units worldwide we ended up
with kit zero zero four and by special
request zero six nine giving us 64 gigs
of 32 hundred megahertz quad channel
ddr4 installed on the baddest assest
motherboard that I have yet to lay my
hands on yes I would choose this over a
rampage the x99 e 10 GW s Brock's eight
memory slots seven PCIe expansion slots
and dual 10 Gigabit LAN ports running on
an Intel X 550 82 Nick buh-buh-buh lid
moving on to the video card I scavenged
this PCIe extender from a lien leo
series case then fastened my NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card using the
sketchy Jam a six and three-quarters
screw through
slightly too small hole in the PCB and
secure it using a threaded insert method
and shockingly it worked very secure
then it was time for the Intel 750
series 1.2 terabyte nvme PCIe SSD that
I'll have on the receiving end of the
full 10 gig file transfers I'll be doing
to and from our server room ah the power
supply might seem like an odd choice
given the overkill nosov a 1500 watt
unit for this hardware but come on did
you really expect any less than top of
the line with custom length and
terminated individually sleeved cables
from cable mod also the fan will never
need to spin which is great I guess and
on the subject of overkill yes my
friends you read the label right that is
40 terabytes of 7200 rpm spindle speed
Barracuda Pro goodness filled with
helium for optimal efficiency we screwed
these into standoffs from the bottom
raising them up a little bit gives me
enough clearance for the front bank of
drives to have the connectors for my
custom length SATA cables run under the
rear ones and plug into the motherboard
the reservoirs were mounted using a
slight modification to the stock mount
to accommodate the thickness of my case
the plan for filling is to leave some
slack in the tubing lines on the bottom
to allow the reservoirs to be pulled up
then tipped and filled from the end cap
leading us then to pumps one of the
trickiest parts of the build I had to
break out the pencil and paper and
double check my flow diagram before
beginning here since the pump fittings
lead directly through the table meaning
they need to be hooked up before I bolt
them down and I couldn't find my damn
cables leaving supplies so I had to
improvise to get the power lead sleeved
for maximum sexiness the end result is
worth it though these ekx top Revo d5s
have built-in anti vibration rings and
threaded holes in the bottom for easy as
pie mounting for my radiators like the
rest of the liquid cooling it's the EK
water block show with two of their cool
streams slim edition 360s each
configured in a push configuration with
three LTT edition Noctua n ff12 fans
we've knocked to his chrome axe
anti-vibration quarter pieces in white
added for a little bit of extra flair
I'm really proud of the power solution
for these which involves removing the
connectors running the sleeved wires
through perfectly sized holes and
plugging them into fan hubs on the
underside of the table onto tubing dear
Lord this took forever but I stuck to my
plan and I think I ended up with tight
enough runs but for the most part they
won't be visible unless you get your
head pretty low down looking under the
table using flexible tubing started out
as a compromise because I hate dealing
with hardline but I think it actually
ended up being what makes this build
look so striking power for the underside
of the table is one wrinkle that I was
already planning to deal with after
painting and installing most of the
hardware but first RGB W LED strips from
cable mod the W here is for white so if
you want white lighting you don't have
to deal with the weird rainbow effect of
mixing red green and blue the included
adhesive clearly won't stick to my paint
at all but the lengths all came out
great so time to break out the drill do
a test hole and to avoid making a mess
inside the desk all while being
painfully aware that the exit hole is
usually not as tidy as the entrance hole
start drilling up through the bottom so
I can have the controller on the outside
oh no terrible oh boy time for some
primer and touch-up paint then while I
wait for that to dry I'll get back to
the LED strips this permanent 3m
adhesive should do the trick back to the
paint now that it's dry actually it
looks not that bad so let's run all the
wires then time for some cable
management I was going to drill down zip
tie loops to hold everything in place up
the right side of the board but actually
since everything was built to size it
ended up looking great and running
straight up the side of the motherboard
exactly as I planned without it it's
kind of like a bad
guy from the matrix Sentinel sentry
whatever they're called looking thing
and I like it so then we finish off the
LEDs with some zip tie anchors so they
can't be seen on the extensions along
the left side and finally it's time to
fill this puppy paper towels for safety
particle board does not like moisture
some distilled water and a funnel and
we're ready for action and oh crap we
ran into a slight problem with some
sediment in the radiators that we forgot
to flush so three hours and an overnight
run later and here we are back in the
studio ready for the finishing touches
some cable and tubing management on the
bottom with zip ties and anchors and a
few Silverstone fan filters on the front
and we are ready to call this puppy
cooked now there are a few things that I
still plan to improve over time
I want to cable manage a power bar a
blade power adapter and a USB hub under
the desk I'm going to add some cutout
furnace filters to the aisle holes with
slits down the middle for cables to pass
through and framing around them similar
to the inside so they look really clean
and I won't have to deal with any dust
buildup inside the system and I'm going
to replace the legs with pad now I'm
just kidding
hate on them all you want but the legs
have held up very well all these weeks
including one time Brandon dragged the
table across the carpet from one end
there just fine and I like how they look
so all that's left then is putting the
glass down on the top and moving this
sick rig to my office upstairs thank you
for coming along for the ride thank you
for your patience and thanks to Intel
for sponsoring this build it has been a
lot of fun so thanks for watching guys
if this video sucked you know what to do
but it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button check out the link to
where to buy the stuff we feature to
dammuz on in the video description and
