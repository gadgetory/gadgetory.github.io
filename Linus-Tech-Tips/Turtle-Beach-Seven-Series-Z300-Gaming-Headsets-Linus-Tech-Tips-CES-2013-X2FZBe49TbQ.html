proud of the 7-series headset that they
have just released here at the show is
that correct we announced this headset
actually at e3 2012 but it's been
designed in conjunction with major
league gaming so after we initially
announced it we shopped it around to
some pro gamers got their feedback on it
we've made a few changes to the product
and now we're relaunching it here at CES
2013 for a release later this month okay
so I think we can both agree that a
gaming headset is totally worthless if
it's not comfortable is that correct
absolutely so let's talk durability and
comfort these are these are memory foam
I can tell you guys right now that it's
very comfortable this is some of the
softest padding that I have encountered
on the ears themselves check this out it
takes this thing like a good couple
steamboats to retract to its original
position which means it's gonna mold
itself it's not gonna put a lot of
pressure on your ears and on the side of
your head when you have even memory foam
that that rebounds very very quickly it
can actually put added pressure versus
this softer denser memory foam so that's
not that's something that I noticed
immediately tell us what you guys have
done sort of that I didn't notice the
comfort so there's a few things here
number one and this is actually some of
the feedback that we got from from our
pro gamers that we talked to so the
angle of this yoke here is incredibly
important to how well a headset fits on
somebody and so we made sure that we
took a bunch of head measurements we did
a bunch of research to make sure that
this would fit as many people as you
know is possibly could obviously it's a
headset you can't make it fit everyone
perfectly but um that's one of the big
things that we did the other thing is
the position of the microphone on this
headset it's designed to naturally come
into front of your mouth where it's
supposed to go it stays in place so
you're not fighting with it all the time
but its position here on the earcup is
great the wire itself also is designed
to be positioned back further on the
headset so it's not going to interfere
with the mic you're not going to get any
sort of a does not come out does not
come out
the other very cool to show you guys
that does come out yes the mic comes out
just like that
which is pretty handy so you can
actually as Lynas here was saying it
does connect why don't show them and you
can see why the mic coming out matters
alright guys so there's a few versions
of this guy so there we're looking at
the XP here which is hooked up to a
console but there's a PC version that
also comes with this particularly cool
doodad and then there's a mobile version
that does not include a microphone and
doesn't come with this one so Jeff tell
us what exactly this capacitive touch
panel thing here does with all these
different buttons and dials and
spaceship so this is our audio control
unit for the seven series basically it
is the brains of the operation what it
does is processes all of the sound so
the headset disconnects right here and
this becomes a mobile headset so it's a
passive headset that you can plug into
your smart phone your tablet your mobile
gaming console whatever you have and
connect it back here to the audio
control unit so the audio control unit
is where the surround sound magic
happens number one it's also fully
programmable so what happens is we have
a tool that's called the advanced sound
editor that you can download from our
website load it up on your PC and get
full control over exactly how the audio
on the headset is processed when you do
this you can actually do things like
turn up the sound of footsteps turn up
the sound of reloads turn down the sound
of tanks if you're playing a sports game
you can turn off the crowd noise lots of
really cool features and all of that is
accessed via the audio control unit and
can I change that around on the fly
while I'm actually in the middle of the
game so the way that it works is you're
allowed to load up eight individual
presets when you're editing numbers one
through eight you set it you set it into
reset mode here and when you pushed all
the buttons on it
when when you touch the numbers on it it
switches among the different presets
that are loaded on to it when you're
editing a preset you do hear the sounds
on the fly change so you can hear the
edits as you make them very cool now you
guys have another little input here that
looks like it's got kind of a phone
phone next to it what does this guy do
that input is another stereo 4-pole
connection you can connect either an mp3
player or another smartphone to it when
you do that then you can actually mix in
your own music from your external device
and/or take phone calls directly through
the headset so
while you're gaming with your friends
you can actually have a phone call as
well so if I take a phone call I mean
everyone that I'm on skype with or Ben
Trillo or whatever they're gonna hear me
my mom you know calling me my nickname
from when I was a kid right nope
definitely not with it this is a mom
nickname safe headset alright so it
automatically is going to mix that out
for me so they're not going to hear any
of that very very cool stuff so we've
got some other oh yeah great thing one
more thing on this there's more but wait
there's more right so the seven series
we know that a lot of pro gamers are in
clans they're in gills they do a lot of
things and they might want to customize
the look of this product so the plates
on the outside of this headset are
actually designed to pop off and we're
working on a system that will allow
gamers to upload their own images and
create designs so that they can
customize the look of their seven
headset to suit their needs and if you
want to play with your clan and you go
to an event or something like that you
can all have matching plates it's pretty
cool stuff so you made a very bold claim
when I first walked up to the booth
where you said something along the lines
of this is the best gaming headset FR
with an a it is this is the most
powerful and I'm gonna I'm gonna crush
this is one thing wired because we have
wireless products that do the same stuff
so in the world of wired headsets this
is absolutely the most powerful most
capable gaming headset that your money
can buy awesome let's move on to the
next product probably now we're
showing you something that may not be as
exciting from a huge amazing feature
standpoint although he's keeping a
couple things away from me that he
hasn't told me yet so this is a
lower-priced headset than the seven but
what does this do that makes it special
and is a first for PC gaming he wouldn't
tell me so this is the Z 300 and it does
bring a few cool features that PC gamers
are unused to having I think in headsets
so number one the connection on this
thing is very simple it's got a USB
thumb stick type device you plug it in
and by the time you're done crawling
around under your desk plugging it in
get back up into your chair it's done
and your heads that's ready to go
it's a driverless plug-and-play
installation it works on Windows Mac and
Linux for all of the seven or eight
games that are still coming they're
coming out but it's a rechargeable
battery it's a 15 hour rechargeable
battery you can also play it
you're charging so if you decide you
want to go on like a 27-hour bender of
Team Fortress 2 you can do that and you
can play it while you're charging it's
extremely comfortable it's got a dual
pairing stereo bluetooth in it as well
so once again you can mix in your own
music you can take phone calls over the
Bluetooth while you're gaming if you
wanted to pair the Bluetooth to the
Bluetooth in your PC you could also do
that it's also designed to have two
audio inputs into the headset over that
USB so if you're using Ventrilo or Skype
or mumble what you can do is go into
your programs audio preferences set up
the output for the chat channel and then
you actually have Hardware level chat
control here so you don't have to tab
out of your game to adjust the chat
volume then you've got game volume
control which is your master system
volume on the back of this ear cup right
here so you don't ever have to tab out
of your game to adjust both your chat or
your game volume to really sweet
features this also runs on what we call
our dual band Wi-Fi system which means
it will have absolutely interference
free connection dual band Wi-Fi is a
Wi-Fi certified protocol it operates
anywhere between 2.4 and 5 gigahertz
when that transmitter fires itself up
it's going to take a survey of the
wireless networks around it it
handshakes and negotiates with those
networks creates an open pathway for
itself and make sure that it doesn't
interfere with anything else so you
won't get lag on the router or anything
else like that tell me about the mode
and the limiter buttons on this side on
this ear cup okay so the limiter is is
one of the cooler features on this
headset I've got to say basically if
you're if you're playing a game and
you're listening for a quiet sound like
a footstep or something like that
chances are you're probably gonna be
turning up the volume a little bit
higher and then somebody is 100% gonna
drop a grenade right beside your foot
it's gonna make it go deaf so with the
limiter does is it limits the maximum
volume so you can crank the volume to
listen for those quieter sounds and then
you can have have the assurance that
you're not going to blow out your
eardrums the mode button actually
addresses this plug down here so we
recognize that gamers don't stay at home
and game all the time I mean sometimes
we go out to the store to buy a new game
right and and what that's all changing
with Steam so what you can do with that
plug actually is it comes to the cable
you can plug that into your smart phone
and you've got a wired connection for
listening to music so if you're on an
airplane this is a mobile headphone you
know they make you turn off the
Bluetooth
devices so you can use that for that as
well sounds great thank you so much
you've actually been a been a great
interviewee for us so thank you guys
