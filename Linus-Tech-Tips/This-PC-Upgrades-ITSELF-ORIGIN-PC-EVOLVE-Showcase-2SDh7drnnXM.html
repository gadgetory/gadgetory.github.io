showed off our new origin gaming PC it
was top-of-the-line 6700 K quad core
processor dual gtx 980ti s and sli all
kinds of great stuff but as it always is
with technology our origin PC gaming rig
well it aged but origin sponsored this
video today for us to tell you about a
program that they have called Origen
evolve which basically takes the way
that DIY computer builders upgrade their
machines over time and makes it so that
you the person who's not necessarily
comfortable or doesn't have the time for
that stuff can take advantage of a
slower upgrade to keep your system up to
date all while retaining your system
warranty
so basically the way it works is as long
as you signed up for the Evolve program
and the extended warranty when you
originally purchased your system and
it's available in either two or three
years of coverage then you contact
Origin PC okay say okay so here's the
components that I have now and here's
what I want to upgrade to and you have
to knock here we're gonna put a list
here of all the different things that
can qualify for evolve and basically
what they do is they do that DIY work of
going in finding a buyer for the used
hardware whether it's on like Craigslist
or Kijiji or eBay or whatever and they
flip the thing for you and they give you
what they determined to be fair market
value towards your upgrade so once
you've agreed that yes indeed they are
providing you fair market value and you
want to go ahead with the upgrade you
pack up your system hopefully uh a
little better than we've done here and
you ship it off to origin then after one
of origins certified technicians has
completed your upgrade they will ship it
back to you with all of the sexy new
hardware included alright so well we've
get this baby fired up with let's say
shadow of the Tomb Raider to test its
gaming prowess let's go ahead and walk
through what exactly we had upgraded
from our old machine so we changed out
our case actually this is pretty cool so
they've got this go paratis so this is
pretty cool they've got this new UV
printing method that they can do on
their glass side panels so you can get
custom graphics on them so that was
something that we did change about the
system this is the town for the other
side but that's not normally covered by
the evolve program so we don't get a
credit for our old case for that but
things that we did get a credit for we
went from a 6700 K to an 8700 K so we've
gone from four cores to six cores the 80
700 K is a faster gaming processor so
now our system is better for both
creation and for gaming and we've got an
extra couple of course in case we wanted
to stream while the game obviously in
order to do that we had to upgrade our
motherboard so we've gone to an EVGA
said 370 classified que we are okay we
didn't really have to change our RAM
but RGB RGB Ram wasn't a thing just two
and a half years ago it's funny because
when you're buried in this stuff every
day you kind of lose track of how
quickly the industry changes so we went
ahead with some RGB RAM and we went from
dual gtx 980ti in sli to dual GTX 10 ADT
eyes so this is going to give us a
significant bump in our gaming
performance we didn't change our power
supply we didn't change our optical
drive so there were a few things that we
were able to reuse now those of you
watching this video are probably
thinking to yourself gee Linus that's
weird timing for an upgrade to the GTX
10 atti when the r-tx
20 atti is either right around the
corner or available right now and that
really is exactly the point of the
origin pc evolve program not needing to
keep track of exactly when hardware's
coming out and still being able to
upgrade like a DIY or would even if well
you aren't really paying attention and
you don't have like a guy to get rid of
your old hardware - for a good price so
I'm just running through making sure
we've got everything configured
correctly here so it comes with SLI
enabled right out of the box and
actually we can have a quick look at our
CPU times here so you can see our 8700 K
is turbo weighing up to four point three
gigahertz and a lightly threaded
workload that's about what we'd expect
to see it's amazing how much CPU just
downloading a game off scheme can use
remember guys there's a decompression
aspect to this as well it's not just
downloading files then looking at a look
here so our package even though we are
lightly loaded here is right around the
40 to 45 degrees Celsius range and then
our cores are all in the it must be a
trial of hardware monitor aha her all in
the 30 to 40 range looking good
should be able to absolutely crank this
game we're running at 34 40 by 1440
ultra-wide let's go ahead and fire it up
man that's it we don't even have desync
or anything on this monitor either
these kids are lighting stuff on fire oh
no they're sparklers but there were a
little pyromaniacs so our average FPS
even including two XS maa is 91 frames
per second you can see we actually ended
up really nicely balanced we were GPU
bound only 2% of the time not too shabby
so that's pretty much it that's the
origin pc evolve program you guys can
check out the full details at the link
in the video description guys if you
just like this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link below also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should definitely join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
