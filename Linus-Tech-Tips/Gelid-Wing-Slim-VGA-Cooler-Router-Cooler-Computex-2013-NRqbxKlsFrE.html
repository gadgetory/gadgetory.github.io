powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM hey guys I'm here at the gelid
booth and I have two wonderful helpers
first thing that I want to cover is
Linus is one of Linus's favorite fans
which is a gelid wing this is UV
reactive fan it comes in blue and green
so if you have UV lights in your
computer you can have these glow it
looks very nice looks very unique if
you're doing a build log if you want to
do a build they're going to show off a
lot UV reactive parts is a very good
thing to have in your build
now one thing people have been looking
for is slimmer fans if you can turn that
to the side just turn it this way there
we go
this fan is very very slim and can fit
in a lot of places that standard fans
can't fit like on some CPU coolers which
will bring us to the next part so we're
gonna come over here and check out their
CPU cooler which is fitting with RAM
they don't have tall RAM in here but it
could just make it by and if you had a
different CPU cooler which is over here
actually sorry for jumping over again
this guy it comes with the slim fan on
it so it is very very very compatible
with different Ram kits tall dominators
or other stuff like that will fit on
this side of the fan which is great
we're going to jump back over here sorry
for being so confusing this isn't out
yet and it's still kind of a sample and
in production blah blah blah but it's a
helpful VGA cooler so if your graphics
card is getting hot you can actually
slot this in if you don't have too many
other cards in your system and help it
clean cool your VGA now one last little
thing that I was shown in the booth if I
could get one of you to hold it is this
guy this was originally designed to help
cool routers so if your router is
getting hot you can put the router under
it and I'll help cool it down but they
notice that has tons of other
applications like Android TV boxes or
Apple TV boxes or really anything else
nest whatever consoles you have if
they're getting too hot you can put this
guy under it on top of it around it just
help airflow and it's just generally
good thanks for checking out our gelid
booth and if you want to see all of our
