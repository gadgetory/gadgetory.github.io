wits others charm and some even rely on
sheer brute force but personally I've
always found the best tool in a jam that
won't land you in prison is a 20-sided
polyhedron which is why no one is
happier than I about the fact that
rolling for initiative and trading sheep
for or are becoming increasingly
mainstream activities in what some would
describe as a recent tabletop gaming
Renaissance but even the most die-hard
fans of board games and RPGs face some
fairly common problems not the least of
which is finding enough people to play
with and while technology like online
message boards and Facebook groups can
facilitate finding other local nerds
sometimes there just aren't enough
people nearby who have the sheer
tenacity and fortitude to sit in a chair
indoors for extended periods of time but
how else has technology improved
tabletop gaming let's explore
ten years ago you either hung out in the
lobby of your local gaming shop until
you found someone with acceptable body
odor stats or you didn't really play but
since then
programs like roll20 octagon and
tabletop simulator have emerged to help
people with a challenging schedule or
without any local group at all feed
their addiction whatever your poison of
choice there's a slick well designed
application to cater to your needs we've
come a long way since the multi-user
dungeons of the 80s and 90s in terms of
both usability and aesthetics with the
marked exception of magic online that is
still absolutely terrible but while
these services will never replace gaming
in person at least not for me they do a
lot more to enhance modern gaming than
something like CalNet built in campaign
and map tools can benefit anyone's game
and by hooking up a short throw
projector to your laptop you can even
create dynamic detailed battle maps for
your players there's also a whole host
of things that you can do with the power
of a computer behind your setup like use
a dynamic lighting feature to induce a
fog of war effect automatically without
physically covering the map with various
household objects and there's more while
you can play Tyler's favorite
role-playing game with a single book and
an unnatural interest in the medieval
Mouse societies I've always been a D&amp;amp;D
kind of guy and to the obviously dozens
of you who are wondering about my
personal favorite edition that's three
points whatever these are some of the
3.5 books Tyler and I had kickin around
and these are the books we had for
Pathfinder neither of these stacks is
even a full collection looking at rules
in the middle of the game can be an
arduous and disruptive task when
considering the sheer girth of the
library that we have here which is why
replacing these stacks of tomes with
something as simple as a searchable PDF
is an absolute godsend and helps take
some of the headache away from managing
the fact that one of your barbarian
players just entered a romance
relationship with a 55 foot long town
burning dragon and you need to brush up
on your large-scale grappling rules card
players are also getting a lot of help
from this newfangled technology I mean
given the ease and the speed of using
online deck builders I can understand
why some people may not want to go back
to binders on binders of cards
especially if you're a fan of games that
are out of print or for some other
reason no longer commercially available
because this way you can still assemble
an electronic collection and find other
diehard fans online to match against
there's also an increased prevalence of
phone apps while there are outliers like
the XCOM board games that even require a
mobile app in order to play both of
these apps are on more of a
supplementary role and while I'm not
personally a huge fan of having phones
at the table these apps can eliminate
some of the tedium of score and
bookkeeping with automated character
sheets or even drafting your team in the
case of the Blood Bowl app and tech is
driving game production as well just
take a look at these Kickstarter numbers
one of the reasons were spoiled for
choice in tabletop gaming right now is
because the barrier to production is so
low and the ability to connect
prospective game makers with funding is
better than ever
we aren't normally huge fans of
crowdfunding here but the success rates
of board game campaigns compared to
video games or technology is much higher
and let's not discount what increased
exposure has done to bring tabletop into
the mainstream you want to watch a video
of Vin Diesel playing D&amp;amp;D you can do
that that's a thing you can even watch
D&amp;amp;D on Twitch right now although I would
request that you finish this video first
increased exposure plus a decrease in
barrier to entry is helping make the
current edition of D&amp;amp;D the most
accessible yet though their business
model may have changed slightly since
the early 2000s which is probably good
news for the ends so these current
levels of growth what's on the horizon
well the rapidly growing availability of
consumer 3d printing hardware means
someday even Dungeon Master's
of limited financial means we'll be
making monsters and ornate dungeon
furniture in their own homes for the
cost of filament and then there's
electronic playing surfaces footage of
people playing board games on the
Microsoft PixelSense blue the community
away a few years back until they saw the
eight thousand dollar price tag but the
dream isn't dead
companies like epon are looking at ways
to make modular and lower-cost services
that could be used to create sprawling
battle maps in your living room table so
with all this in mind maybe the next
time you check out your backlog of 500
unplayed early access games and steam
maybe you'll consider trying something
more refined try it check out a tabletop
simulator game get a group of friends
together for some good old wholesome D&amp;amp;D
and hey if you have more enemies than
friends that's fine too here's a list of
games that are perfect for making sure
that they never talk to you again in a
socially acceptable manner
