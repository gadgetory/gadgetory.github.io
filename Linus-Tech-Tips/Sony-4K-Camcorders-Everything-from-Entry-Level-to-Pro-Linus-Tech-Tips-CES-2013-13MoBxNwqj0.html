our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys guys we're here checking out
some sweet Sony cameras because we all
know that as interesting as a 4k TV is
unless there's actually a way to
generate 4k content then yeah not that
interesting so Mike's going to show us a
few different things that are coming
down the pipe including one that our
crew is particularly excited about and
that is the upcoming 4k functionality of
the fs700 Mike can you tell us about
this pack that's attached to it right
here this is the r5 recorder this will
allow you to do 16 bit raw recording
from the fs700 we think late spring
maybe may soonish some time into there
Mike do you want to tell us how fast
that recorder can record data 2.5 gigs
per second outstanding love to see it
and the one we have right here this is
so new ultra prototypes so has anyone at
the booth even seen this before today no
amazing so guys have a look at this
thing it's actually about the size of
something more like an FS 100 which is
sort of a four thousand dollar ish 1080p
camera except this is capable shooting
full 4k correct outstanding love to see
more and hear more about this when it's
actually available now we're gonna move
over to more like a professional grade
camera back in a moment now I won't make
to tell us a little bit about this
camera right here now this is what was
it a thirty five thousand dollar just
for the body twenty twenty four thousand
dollars for a lens kit okay so you guys
aren't buying this I understand that and
if you are Mike sends his personal
things however I would like him to talk
about the technology that it goes into a
device like this that enables us to even
record 4k you got a little thing in your
there tell us about this guy SPS card
this is one of our new Pro Plus cars
that can do 60 megabits 600 megabits I'm
sorry per second on board of the camera
this will allow you to do 30 minutes of
sport kick 4k recording tell me
something you got two slots there does
that give you some creative options like
continuous filming it just swap them in
them out we can either do a or b or both
at the same time for mirroring or a
cascade from A to B then you can just
keeps cascading the cards very exciting
so I'm sure you guys can't wait until 10
years from now when you can actually buy
something like this that you can carry
around thanks Mike thanks for watching
