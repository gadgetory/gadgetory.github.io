man's car with my with my Sony Bloggie

the camera man's actually replaced his
old white 3-series Beemer so he's got a
new roadster BMW it's been like a really
really funky blue color and then I'm
gonna look inside the car it's got the
whole leather interior thing going on
he's only got two seats in this
particular car so you can tell he's not
like cruising down the street with his
posse or anything like that oh that was
the that was the cameraman right there
that was his leg so now you've
officially seen the cameraman he's also
got his like sweet racing tires and
everything there's his little band I'm
trying not to show you his license plate
cuz the last thing I want is people
stalking the cameraman but there you go
that's the camera man's new car he has
replaced the old white Beamer that I've
shown you on a number of occasions with
the new and improved blue Beemer so

this video is about the video recording
quality of the blog II so I'm gonna go
ahead and sort of look around here check
