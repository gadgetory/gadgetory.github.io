Samsung's fairly new at the gaming
notebook game however they've been doing
notebooks for a while they're obviously
very experienced when it comes to a lot
of aspects of IT especially
manufacturing so I'm very excited to
check out the English side of the
packaging here on the 700 series 707
hundred g7 C this is the s0 one and the
particular spec is it is a 17 inch
notebook with Windows 7 home premium a
core i7 3610 QM this is an Ivy Bridge
CPU hence the three at the beginning of
the part number a 17.3 inch full HD 400
nits LCD screen a GTX 670 5m with 2 gigs
of gddr5 so that is not your
grandmother's graphics card 16 gigs of
ddr3 memory as well as blue oh has a
blu-ray player cool Gigabit LAN as well
as 802.11 a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 this
is a black gaming notebook it has an
illuminated keyboard and I believe it
also has a 1.5 terabyte drive inside it
so let us take a look-see at what we
will find first we have accessories in a
very plain brown box that's all this is
um not what I would have typically
expected to find in terms of sort of
packaging strategy this is a very
strange shape I'm really not sure what
they were going for here yeah no I know
that's like but I just don't understand
how this fits in here ok well now see
that didn't even go in there no it
doesn't
yeah even that I really don't see it
okay forget it um so anyways we have a
power brick which is a pretty
substantial power brick at the gtx 675
so it's yeah pretty pretty significant
so how many 19 volts ten point five amps
is what they want for this guy got a
power cable not a whole lot in terms of
accessories although that's pretty much
to be expected it's not much that goes
with a notebook we've got a battery
standard battery pack battery cells made
in Korea and assembled in China 89 watt
hours or 50 900 milliamp hours okay
that's valid okay get started Windows
seven don't forget guys if you buy a
notebook today you can get a Windows 8
upgrade for nothing all right no not for
nothing for 15 bucks u.s. or something
like that so don't worry about buying a
Windows 7 notebook today not to be able
to run Windows 8 when it comes we got a
nice soft cell phone here - I can't it's
a very strange shape why is it bowed
like that see that now it's bowed why is
it both this one's bowed to see look at
it did they look like did they save
money on the phone by like having
slightly less phone here strange I mean
either way the notebook arrived in one
piece so we can't really complain the
notebook was you know in several pieces
then we would definitely definitely
complain mmm that's very nice actually
check this out so this is a very unique
finish now Samsung isn't new to the
whole brushed plastic thing so brushed
aluminum II looking plastic however this
one has a glossy layer on top of the
brushed plastic look with their Samsung
logo right there looking pretty nice as
well this is actual aluminum right here
so that is an actual brushed aluminum
finish right there
although I'm usually a bigger fan of
just the plain black brushed plastic for
a number of reasons including there
being easily easier to clean for a
gaming notebook even this is a lot of
cooling huge cooler here huge cooler on
the other side even on a Seuss's
g-series I've seen them a have two big
vents at the back but one of them is
actually
just a dummy vent and there's nothing
actually in it in terms of heat sinks no
this one is serious business about the
cooling because this is again not your
ground this notebook she can't lift it
it is a gaming notebook it is pretty
heavy and it is pretty thick so there's
the old iPhone comparison that you guys
are so fond of and let's see what else
we got going on here so ah should we
boot it up first or should we here let's
put the put the battery in really quick
so the battery goes here okay locks into
place
alright let's flip her over well let's
see what we've got in terms of easy
upgrade ability so these ones look like
they don't come off too easy this one
looks like it comes off pretty easy so I
see yeah I can't tell what I see in
there since flip it back over okay
let's boot her up let's see how much of
a charger comes on the battery look how
nice it is I'm very fond of this maybe
I'll get one for my birthday
probably not let's go ahead and take all
the plastic key bits off look at that
back like keyboard that is a gorgeous
alright so while it's booting up we can
have a look at what we've got in terms
of pop yeah look at that here sorry I'm
like getting ahead of myself here but
look how awesome that is can you see how
awesome it is dead sexy very bright very
nice okay alright I oh so there's your
blu-ray drive
there's your USB 2 port here's another
more different USB 2 port this knob
right here it's for gaming mode balance
mode energy-saving mode and then I think
that's probably normal mode see just go
like that switch between all the
different power modes it's pretty cool
so we're going to put it in balance pin
for now okay on the front we find not a
whole lot other than and it power LED as
well as a hard drive indicator LED oh no
no I don't think that's what that is at
all what that is ok moving right along
we've got on the back ventilation and on
the left the bulk of our
oh so here we find our Kensington lock
our power input our gigabit lan vga hdmi
and displayport lots of different
options here
2 USB 3 SuperSpeed ports a an SD card
reader microphone and headphone jack so
that is a very vibrant display as well
viewing angles not bad color doesn't
distort too much actually that's not bad
my language is definitely English so
let's go with that
ok you cannot change your language later
haha so let's go demo press the next
type of password ok look away ah ok ah
hint oh that's not a very good hint at
all ok I accept the license terms which
I have of course speed read through
really fast because that's an important
part of making sure that you accept
license not sharply ok so here we go so
we've got lots of different sort of like
sexy stuff going on in here that like
apparently like it's like muted now or I
don't know this is like a wheel I'll
have to figure that out okay so we got
speakers here we've got like turbo
button anything going on here there's
our hard drive indicator LED there's our
caps lock indicator power buttons here
more speakers here and what happened to
that backlit keyboard it looks so good
oh there we go oh my goodness touch
sensitive buttons so sexy so that's your
second review button I don't know but I
like this one yeah so cool ok so we've
got lots of different hotkeys with the
functions and brightness up down it's
like control panel external display
turning the touchpad off apparently it
has software on it that will
automatically turn the touchpad off and
turn the windows key off if you're
playing a game so I don't know how well
that works without I've tried it but
this looks like it's probably the
keyboard LED backlight how bright you
wanted around not very do you on it
given that all of software isn't loaded
like probably all this functionality
necessarily working out of something to
do with fans and that's turning wireless
on and off although there is a dedicated
button for that as well so why don't we
give it a few minutes to boot up here
and then we'll I'll come back to this so
we took this off to find out what was
under it not realizing that it was of
course clearly labeled optical hard
drive and memory so down here check this
out
we've got two memory dims each of these
are 4 gigs so that means there's
probably two more under the keyboard
that's a very common configuration and
then we've got two hard drives you can
also remove the optical drive with this
screw right here so you could actually
remove one of these 750 gig drives which
are yet probably in raid 0 I would
assume although that's the least wise
possible thing to do in a notebook my
personal opinion I would go with an SSD
and a hard drive for mass storage but
yeah so I take one of those out throw it
in an external enclosure and you know
get yourself to 750 gig drive out of the
deal and then install your OS reinstall
your OS onto an SSD drive that is the
way to go I love
notebooks that have multiple hard drive
installation highs one one screw because
it gives you the option to have the best
of both worlds SSD and HDD so we have
the system I think pretty much booted up
thank you but we're good set the touch
pad and Windows key game option modes
okay that's cool gaming mode dial
brilliant graphic card fast booting okay
alright
so they actually that is a very cool
desktop background but this is not a
cool mouse problem pointer yeah Samsung
just know you may not do that um okay
let's try some of the buttons and stuff
so let's try the turbo button okay we'll
have to find out how that works so let's
finish up the physical attributes of it
there's your microphone so if you were
say for example webcaming it up with
somebody with the included webcam then
you could make sure that you sort of
talked so close to that that would be it
okay all these buttons are working now
that we're actually loaded into the
elastic see brightness goes up and
brightness goes down keyboard brightness
actually
we'll be more evident with the lights a
little bit lower in here keyboard
brightness can also be turned up or down
there you go so it's all the way down
and it's all the way up the whole way up
looks really good so cool okay I'm
moving right along
turbo it turns out is just like an LED
okay this does mute it okay so you can
see over here you not mute okay
the wireless one okay all of that stuff
seems pretty good built-in full keypad
potful um and number pad honestly the
keyboard feels pretty good just very
little flex to it and the keys feel
really really nice the system also
seemed really responsive and I was kind
of going too slick I was like well does
it have an SSD cache well it looks like
they have these configured not in rate
so just two separate drives and then
they're using they are using an SSD
cache to cache the boot drive so there's
eight gigs of SSD cache Ness which you
can see here from the Samsung SSD so
that's really cool love to see that SSD
caching is awesome and it should be used
absolutely everywhere yeah don't I
haven't forgotten
nice big touchpad left and right buttons
all of this is pretty much to be
expected and I think that pretty much
covers it in terms of you know overall
build quality feels really good actually
weights a little high but what can you
hear it's a gaming notebook what can I
really tell you so let's show you guys
the different modes here so if you
switch to a balanced mode you can see
that the actual desktop background does
change and it goes into you know well
more of a balanced configuration so we
switch into whatever mode that is here
let's find out what that root is because
I was sure we still have it why did you
just call it library mode because I
don't think that's what it is honestly
called library mode okay they're library
mode guess it's for like reading and
then the last mode is eco-friendly mode
which is the most power saving one so if
you're in balanced mode the silence
button actually works so if you go here
and here you can go into silent mode
which incidentally makes it run very
quiet now we're going to turn the silent
mode off and I'm going to show you guys
like the coolest thing
ever check this up so we're gonna go
back into gaming mode hold on hold on
you have to watch me hit the swedge well
now just go back so they can see
everything see I'm going to hit the
switch oh it's muted okay we have to all
we have to do it again okay so we go
back to balance mode and then here whole
are and turn up dramatic pause
uh yeah gaming mode by the way your
battery might run out quickly if you
don't plug in AC power in gaming mode
and you actually play games so that sort
of goes without saying so thank you for
