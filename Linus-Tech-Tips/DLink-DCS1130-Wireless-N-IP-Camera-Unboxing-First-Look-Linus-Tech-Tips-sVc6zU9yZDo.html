unboxing of something we've never really
done on my Linus tech tips channel this
is a wireless n network camera from
d-link
and the biggest improvement over
previous wireless and network cameras is
that they're saying it is really really
easy to use they also have this my
d-link portal which enables a lot of the
ease-of-use features so here's one thing
you do that you can just get this
sticker up you can see this sticker was
thrown onto the box at the last minute
because now supports and this is brand
new iPhone monitoring of your camera so
you just download a little iPhone app
you sign into my d-link and you can use
it to monitor whatever your camera is
set up to look at so you know I could
set one up at home and then if I had an
iPhone which I am planning to get I'm
planning to get an iPhone 4 yes I know
about the reception issues etc etc but
cameraman has convinced me he has
convinced me he says there are no
reception issues and there are no
problems and an Apple does everything
really really well so I'm gonna be
getting an iPhone 4 I'm on like a
waiting list for it not in any
particular hurry so why don't we have a
look at some of the features of this
camera it is Wireless in for one thing
ok that's a feature good other features
should we talk about minimum
requirements if you have a reasonably
modern PC that's not going to be an
issue
aa feature is remotely off monitor your
home or office over the Internet it does
it has a 1 Lux sensitivity sensor for
low-light recording ok has a 16 X
digital zoom a digital zoom I never
really recommend using it because you
can always just like zoom in on the
image later there's no there's no need
to use a digital zoom wireless and
built-in microphone oh it has sound
recording that's pretty good
use those mjpeg I think you can read all
this if you really want to
there you go when you're working let's
find out what's included here is a
little QuickStart guide tells you how to
contact their Live Support okay also
located inside here so there's the Quick
Start Guide there's the warranty info
presumably ok ok something in French and
then we have a start here DVD I would
actually recommend using this because
the whole idea behind this thing is that
you just pop in the disc and then it all
works quickly and easily inside here we
will find mounting hardware okay so we
got some screws you've got some other
screws and brackets a little standard
metal stand nice I assume that was going
to be plastic but that's actually got
like some here that it's got some heft
to it ok let's see what else we got in
here we have a power adapter that will
power the camera we have two wireless
and ready antennas not that it's an
antenna particularly needs to be
Wireless and ready but there we are why
don't we put that on there
so we're just going to assemble the
camera you can see the two antennas go
on the back here
I think d-link recommends this for use
with something like their dir-655 which
happens to be a router that I have in my
fleet so I will definitely try this out
this is a product that I will most
assuredly do like a video showing you
guys exactly how well it works so that
you don't have to spend your hard-earned
cash on it without without knowing that
it's awesome
and I'm also just kind of curious too
because I've never used an IP camera
before it's the growing category I mean
people who just want home security or if
they want how the heck does this work
speaking of ease of use
huh
okay the assembly process appears to
have run into a bit of a snag so why
don't we just look at the camera itself
and we'll forget the assembly but we'll
do that off camera so we've also got an
Ethernet port at the back that's ten
hundred Ethernet which is all you really
need for a camera like this there's your
power over here we have WPS so that
means that if you have a WPS supporting
router all you have to do is press the
two buttons you don't have to bother
with wireless passwords or anything like
that it'll automatically sync up there's
a reset hole right here also some
ventilation slots in the top so let's
assume there's something in there that's
producing a little bit of heat there's
some disclaimers here about class B
digital apparatus as well as some more
ventilation holes on this side there's
screw that the back for disassembling it
there's another way to mount the stand
which I guess would be why you'd have it
straight up okay and then finally we
look at the front of the camera itself
so there's your microphone wall this is
gonna be some kind of power indicator
LED and then there's the lens itself
which turns for some reason I hope I'm
not ruining it you know there's not a
whole lot to say in an unboxing of a
camera which is why any time we've done
unboxings with cameras in the past we
always include some performance for it
so stay tuned we're definitely going to
show you how this camera performs and I
actually did see a live demo when our
d-link rep came in to my work and cix
never met if you want to check out the
office so we're just outside the office
right now and he did show one of these
cameras set up in their office and he
just showed it to us on his iPhone and
it was actually pretty cool someone
walked past and it was pretty fluid so
yeah stay tuned don't forget to
