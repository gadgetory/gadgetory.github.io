which unlike the headphones we looked at in our last round up
Don't cost three hundred and fifty US dollars. So let's take a look. Shall we?
The sound surge 46 comes in a
reasonably low-profile rectangular case similar to the one that comes with the Microsoft Surface headphones because
Like those ones these headphones are solid and don't fold in the box
There's a seat belt a netted pouch and a few accessories including a three-and-a-half millimeter audio cable for wired listening
Assuming of course that you still have a device with a headphone jack
You also get a 2 foot long charging cable
which believe it or not is actually longer than the cables that come with lots of premium brand headphones including Sony and Bose and
while it is micro USB
It does still support fast charging and they claim two hours of music playback
After just five minutes of charging and a full charge in just 45 minutes looking at the industrial design of the headphones themselves
They are closed back over ear headphones with swiveling and tilting ear cups
Which are welcome features because they not only make them more portable
but also more comfortable as they can form to your head better and
sometimes it's nice to be able to rotate them when they're sitting on your shoulders as
I manipulate the headphones here something you guys will probably notice
Is that they are nearly silent which is great because
Lots of headphones are quite creaky, which can be annoying
the ear cups are plastic and anodized aluminum with nice plushy protein leather earpads and
As a total bonus a bit of padding right here in front of the 40 millimeter drivers
Many headphones put only a thin piece of cloth here, which can be immediately uncomfortable
If your ears stick out far enough to press against the driver the headband can be ratcheted through 10 graduated steps
Which was large enough for the biggest melons in our office and offers about a centimeter of padding at its deepest point
now all the playback controls
are on the right ear cup with all the functions controlled by just three buttons the volume up and down buttons are also used to
Skip tracks if you hold them down while the power on and off button
Also plays and pauses during media playback or hangs up during calls
Which you can make hands-free with the onboard microphone
You can also double tap power for redial or hold down for bluetooth pairing or up to a claimed 30
Hours of playtime finally, there's the active noise-cancelling switch on the front of the ear cup
Which does take a little bit of getting used to it's got a green LED that indicates that
ANC is on now taotronics says this will reduce any low
Repetitive frequencies like engine noise on a plane or the hvac sounds in your office by up to 96 percent
And it works by using a microphone to listen to the environment around you then produce
Equal but opposite sound waves to cancel out noise
There's also some noise reduction acting on your phone calls as the microphone uses Qualcomm's clear voice capture 6.0 technology
This is a suite of algorithms that are built into the microphone audio processing circuit that makes your voice sound
Better to the person that you're talking to it's nice to have when your headset doesn't have a protruding mic. Boom
But instead houses the microphone within the ear cups
like what we've got here now sound wise they've got a lot of bass and a wide soundstage and
Perform their best at low to medium volumes though
They will go louder if you want to so that's the sound surge 46 available now at the link below if you're looking for something
similar but a bit more compact by the way TaoTronics also offers the foldable and
Less expensive sound surge 60 as well as to sound Liberty 53 truly wireless earbuds for even less than that
