more welcome to what amounts to
basically an unboxing and a second look
at the geforce gtx 770 directs you to
from asus now i call it a second look
because i've already had this card out
of the box and i have actually already
had a chance to benchmark it so okay i'm
gonna spoil the surprise a little bit
it's a geforce gtx 770 which means it's
based on the same GK 104 core as the gtx
680 a fully enabled core to be more
cleared so okay fill its the gtx 680 no
because it's clocked higher this one in
particularly because it's an OC level
card and it also has seven gigahertz
gddr5 memory as opposed to the six
gigahertz gddr5 memory that we found on
the original gtx 680 now the first
things we find inside are a nice black a
susan box with some gold printing on it
as well as a bunch of accessories that
we didn't get with our reference card
that came direct from nvidia so it's
interesting to see what Asus includes so
they've got a QuickStart guide as well
as some drivers and GPU tweak software
that you do well to download directly
from the Asus website and finally last
but not least a dual six pin two single
eight pin PCI Express power adapter next
up is the card itself now the first
thing you're gonna notice about it in
all likelihood is going to be the cooler
the direct cu2s cooler gets its name
from the copper heat pipes as well as
the direct contact that they make with
the GPU itself this improves thermal
efficiency as well as improving overall
performance of the card especially in an
overclocked environment there are two
fans on it each of which is sealed
against dust making it dust proof and
adding to the longevity of the card and
allowing them to cover a wider area of
the card itself providing more airflow
not only to cool the Jeep
you itself because it's connected with
these nice fat heat pipes to all of
these fins but also the other components
under the heatsink fins all over the
entire PCB of the graphics card on the
back of it we find not a whole lot that
you can see except for a backplate this
contributes to the rigidity of the card
which is especially important when cards
are get longer and heavier and they're
installed in chassis that only really
fasten them at the screws at the top
here as well as the PCI Express slot and
the last thing that we see are a couple
of diagnostic LEDs right under the six
pin and eight pin PCI Express connectors
that tell us if there's any kind of a
power problem causing the card to be
non-functional Direct see you tube
coolers are also well-regarded for their
quiet operation and we did indeed have
the same experience with this card so I
can happily say that it sits proudly
with the other directs YouTube cards
that we've had the opportunity to play
with here's a cool feature for liquid
coolers and tweakers and just generally
guys who are willing to push the limits
of their hardware sort of no matter what
the no matter what the risk by simply
removing four screws on the back of the
card you can remove the entire direct
cu2 cooler this allows it to be cleaned
or just completely removed and replaced
with something else should you see fit
although most people probably aren't
gonna bother with that you will have to
break a seal in order to get the cooler
off however that risk is entirely up to
each individual user and check that out
it comes apart just like that to reveal
the way that the card is cooled so we
get thermal goop on the GPU itself no
thermal pads present on the memory
because of what I mentioned before the
way that the directs you to cooler
provides so much airflow to the rest of
the card you don't really have to worry
too much about that we can see the
entire eight plus two phase power design
this is compared to okay so eight plus
two phase digital power design compared
to the five plus one phase analog power
design that you're going to find on a
reference card
and I dedicated heatsink for the MOSFETs
themselves that allows that that's the
hottest part of the power delivery that
allows them to stay cool now there's
more to a custom PCB design than just
designing the PCB you also have to use
higher quality components if you're
going to get any benefit out of it
whatsoever
so that's where a sous is SAP or super
alloy power components come in most of
the power delivery circuitry actually is
comprised of these specially designed
components that a sous has engineered in
order to deliver better overclocking
better efficiency cooler operation
longer life time and this is sort of
this hits pretty close to home for me
les coil line because oil line is just
annoying and then mind you so our dead
cards and cards that consume more power
for no reason but that was the rationale
behind redesigning it in order to use
their own components it was to achieve
all of those things but how did it all
work out in the end my final word on
this card is going to be about GPU tweak
and the actual results that we were able
to achieve because all of this is fine
in theory but what does it yield in the
real world our direct see YouTube card
overclocked higher than our reference
card take that for what it is this is a
very small sampling but in our
experience we did manage to get a
slightly higher sustainable boost clock
okay so it was only 35 or so some odd
megahertz higher than this particular
card but there you go higher is higher
and we did get better performance out of
a direct to YouTube card than we did out
of a reference card also using GPU tweak
was a fairly good experience I've never
used it before at least not extensively
but it does have some special features
that allows it to work better with Asus
cards particularly the ones that use
their custom vrm designs that are pretty
different from all the other things that
are out there on the market and with the
integrated GPU zedd utility as well as
the ability to set up monitoring as a
widget it's pretty handy thanks for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the gtx 770 direct so you too from
