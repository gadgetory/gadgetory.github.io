one now this is yeah I know you were
expecting me to say hundred after that
or something right no no no this is just
the antique 25 no no no not the NSX
plenty fine
that's how many years an tak has been uh
well around no the one is the model
number not the 25 no hundred and the one
so what is the one all about the one is
all about an up-to-date feature set good
ventilation sturdy construction we hope
we're going to find out that for sure
although if it's an tech that's pretty
much my expectation even on their value
cases they really don't make anything
flimsy I mean look at this they're still
using double walled cardboard even for a
value oriented case now they have often
for a hard foam versus versus a soft
foam not my preferred way of doing
things but given this is a more value
case I think we can forgive them for it
because nobody should be loading up you
know 60 pounds worth of computer
hardware in a case like this this is
work for you need a basic system you
want it to be ATX compatible so not not
em ATX but you want something fairly
small with good ventilation etc etc so
here is the antec actually that's not
bad it looks kind of like the it looks
kind of like a more up-to-date 300
actually we've got a 300 over there
that's serving us quite well as our tech
tips video editing machines so I do
personally believe in the fit in fact
that is the 300 that was part of the
NCIX tech tips episode on thermal
management where we took a crappy case
and we substitute we swapped it out for
the 300 in order to demonstrate how much
cooler your
she can run if you have a case that is
designed for optimal cooling and there
it is all right so let's start with the
externals we've got thumb screws
securing the side panels we have as I
mentioned before ample ventilation so
here in the front we have a spot for our
120 millimeter cooling fan we also have
three five and a quarter inch base your
ntek logo you're just nice sleek lines
usb3
BAM on a value case like this that is a
great thing to see reset switch power
switch headphones and microphone ports
okay we've got a 120 millimeter cooling
fan included in the top as well as a
spot for what appears to be a 140
millimeter fan on the side give me a
second that might be 120 sorry guys it
was just the styling of the honeycomb
mesh that confused me a little bit that
is for a 120 millimeter fans almost all
of the fans in this case are 120
millimeter you can see it uses this sort
of punched out style of design it still
looks fairly sleek you can see from the
front it's very aerodynamic but from the
back it's more wide and the reason for
that is it gives you space for this fan
here without interfering with your
graphics card and gives you space for a
taller CPU coolers so there's a very
practical reason why they've done that
all right oh yeah sorry I never finished
on the back so on the back we find an
included i/o shield I haven't seen one
of those in a while very nice and I see
it's not any more up to date than they
used to be there's your spot for your
parallel port which is evidently labeled
Venus for some reason sure whatever man
okay and then we've got a 120 or 92 or
80 ml fan in the back water cooling
grommets which you're not very likely to
use because you're probably going to get
one of those integrated liquid cooling
things like the 620 or the 920 then
you've got 7 PCI slots a bottom mounted
power supply very nice to see antic is
still not neglecting awesome features
like bottom mounted power supplies even
on a value case and we move to the
inside so here is the one spot in the
case where you can put a 140 millimeter
fan as a bottom intake using the feet on
the bottom you can see it's lifted up a
fair amount off
off the floor or table wherever you put
it there's also a fan filter that is
removable here for your power supply
intake fan so you can have air coming in
here cooling your power supply and going
directly out and air also coming in here
to cool your graphics card or whatever
else happens to be in this general
vicinity this is an invaluable include
you know I've always liked the word in
value well hated it really because the
word invaluable implies that it has no
value but you say invaluable to mean
very valuable so what's the dealio ok so
here is your USB 3 2 USB 2 adapter so if
you are putting together a value system
that does not have a USB 3 header for
those front USB 3 you can just hook them
up as USB 2 with the included adapter
Thank You ante
that is a very fantastic conclusion both
we've got a piece of paper thank you for
that as well and then we have a large
CPU cut out so that's so you can install
pretty much any cooler you want without
actually removing the motherboard from
the case
there's your 120mm fan plugs in with a
three pin header look at all these black
cables and texts getting stylish look at
that also black cables for that guy so
the only cooling that is included with
the case is the top and the back but you
can still install as I mentioned before
here here and on the side panel in order
to get additional cooling now uh how
does this work
fascinating you know what I'll be back
in a moment now as a test of how easy
they are to list drive configuration is
to set up there's the back panel by the
way also got that bulge thing going on
for additional room for cable management
in this case as a test of how easy their
tool is configuration is I am going to
figure it out on camera the only thing I
was doing off-camera there was fetching
myself some drives to install so here we
go okay
Hey look at that there including Drive
rails look like a $60 case that's
fantastic alright now we're gonna put
these here presumably
okay and then we're gonna put these here
presumably damn let's do one more just
to show how quickly we can do it now
that we are seasoned veterans at
installing this particular tool list
drive and system and bam love it so from
the front looks like this got like you
know some cool honeycomb II ventilation
a looking thing going on from the back
you can see it's riveted in okay should
be quite strong that's been a problem
with some cheaper cases in shipping with
hard drives this one you shouldn't have
that issue although and better if you
could screw them in but I guess they're
not really going anywhere once you have
a side panel closed on this side this is
interesting so this is like a big like
rubber thing going on so I guess that Oh
fascinating so they've put this in in
order to keep the motherboard tray
because you see they cut out so much of
it for that in large CPU cooler they
wanted to reinforce it in some way so
once you put a motherboard on here it's
not going this way but in order to keep
it from flexing they've got this Ridge
Ridge ax ting it up
I know bridge eating isn't a word but
making it more rigid during shipping or
whatever else wow that's cool oh we've
got lots of cable management tie down
places here you can run your 8 pin up
here you run your 24 pin through the
nice big one here that can also go to
your optical drives which are to lists
more cable management hooks and you can
accept up to one two three four five
three and a half inch drives and there's
an SSD mounting spot down here at the
bottom so you just screw those up from
the bottom there and install your SSD I
think that pretty much code know the
included internal connectors sorry guys
that was close
vote right this parrot wouldn't vote if
you put four million votes through it HD
audio USB 3 which as you may recall can
be converted power led hard drive LED
power switch and reset switch there are
all your included cables
you should probably route them through
here and then take them to wherever they
need to go which is probably here check
oil those up nice and tight get them all
running through the cable management
loops at the back and it should look a
little something like that good better
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the enttec 1 don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and there's the to
list five and a quarter inch mechanism
and other computer videos sorry guys I
realized I never showed you how to
install the 120mm fan in the front so it
comes with included screws see those two
longer ones so there's two bumps two
screws BAM
120 millimeter fan goes there and that's
what it looks like from the inside it's
easy to get off you just try not to drop
the case
well yeah do that and then if you want
to take it off you just pull on it like
that no problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
