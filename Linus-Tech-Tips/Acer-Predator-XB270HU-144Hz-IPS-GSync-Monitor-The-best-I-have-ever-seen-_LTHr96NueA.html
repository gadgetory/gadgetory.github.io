store with X amount of dollars in my
hand till the sales rep I had amount of
dollars X minus 2 then after some
upselling I'd walk out of the store
having spent X amount on whatever
Samsung monitor fit my budget well
thanks to Acer and LG my life has gotten
a lot more complicated lately with LG
seriously upping their game and
delivering some amazing curved and ultra
wide displays and Acer waking up to the
existence of the gaming market in a
focused fierce manner well today's
ferocious gaming monitor is the predator
xB 270 hu from Acer and it might just be
the best I've ever seen
now this isn't the first time a star has
blown me away with a gaming monitor
there xb2 a thk became my 4k monitor of
choice for gaming thanks to being the
first 4k display to feature support for
g-sync a technology that eliminates the
annoying screen tearing and that's
associated with uncapped frame rates and
the stuttering and lag associated with
vsync for users of compatible NVIDIA
GeForce graphics cards but I still had
some issues with it for one the 3840 by
2160 resolution is extraordinarily
difficult to drive in triple-a gains
even for a high-end graphics card so you
got a factor in constant video card
upgrades in the cost of your gaming
setup and for - while TN monitors have
improved dramatically in the last couple
of years it's still a TN so that means
lower contrast worst color performance
and lesser viewing angles compared to VA
or IPs type panels so ultimately the
monitor that won the spot on my gaming
desk was the asus rog swift PG 278 Q
which fixed a couple of those problems
well that changes today the xB 270 hu
delivers some absolutely jaw-dropping
specs that will make it the weapon of
choice for just about any gamer it
features a 27-inch 2560 by 1440 IPS
panel with that G sync technology I
mentioned before giving folks who are
willing to trade some response time and
refresh rate for better visuals a chance
to finally try g-sync which oh hold on
sorry let me just put that away sorry so
like I was saying IPS lovers can trade
response times and refresh rate to
finally try g-sync okay for crying out
loud
alright I gotta take this just yeah what
is it I'm in the middle of filming this
what you're me okay that was a sir there
is no trade off the
xB 270 hu is also the first IPS 2560 by
1440 monitor that supports a 144 Hertz
refresh rate natively out of the box
that's on par with the Tian based PG 2 7
8 Q with no overclocking tomfoolery
required to get that performance and
while pixel response times are a touch
higher than the top TN panels about 4
milliseconds versus 1 millisecond 3
milliseconds of response time is
definitely a trade that I'll make for
the better experience of IPs especially
for only a $20 price premium over its
closest g-sync
supporting competitor so maybe the
physical overview will reveal some fatal
flaw or something of the xB 278 xu
features a rounded glossy thick base
with an orange accent ring okay so it's
not doing that well here so far
connected to a stand with support for
the full range of ergonomic adjustments
tilt swivel height adjust and pivot
alright this just got a little more
interesting at the back we'll find the
usual g-sync monitor i/o so power and
DisplayPort this is a g-sync limitation
so there's nothing Acer can really do
about it without implementing a full
additional scaler like Ben Q did with
the XL 2430 T along with the USB 3 hub
with two ports underneath at the back
and two on the left hand side of the
display and since we're moving in that
direction let's have a look at the front
ooh
marks off here again Acer went and put a
reasonably slim I'll be it not as slim
as the PG 270 q bezel on here but they
went and made it glossy when will they
learn thankfully the panel itself is a
really nice semi matte so kudos for that
moving on the on-screen display which
can be accessed with the buttons at the
bottom right is fairly limited this is
once again AG sync issue with brightness
adjustment pixel response time
adjustment that I'd recommend leaving on
normal some rudimentary color profiles
and then a couple of cool things you can
put a very narrow refresh rate indicator
on the left side of the screen so if
you're obsessive about that kind of
thing you can keep an eye on it and
there's also the menu for ultra-low
motion blur a back light strobing
technique that unfortunately can't be
used at the same time as g-sync
but does have the extremely positive
effect of significantly reducing the
smeary appearance of moving objects on
the screen the only caveat here are that
you're limited to 100 Hertz which is
still very noticeably better than 60
Hertz by the way and the maximum screen
brightness is significantly impacted by
this setting since it's effectively
turning the backlight on and off
many times per second to simulate the
way that CRTs worked by flashing an
image versus displaying and then holding
an image on the screen until it updates
so let's talk about using this puppy
then shall we
well it's awesome I actually don't
really know what else to say about it
g-sync has been and continues to be
awesome 1440p continues to be a sweet
spot for gamers who want more than 60
FPS without spending ludicrous amounts
of money on three or four weig graphics
card configurations that deliver results
that are only sort of better in many
cases as you'll see in this video here
but don't want to be stuck in the 1080p
Stone Age and the IPS panel on this
thing is unlike any I've ever seen
before you see the thing is that faster
refresh rates have been done but it's
the pixel response times that have been
an issue for high refresh rate IPS
monitors in the past
so most cursor movement or in-game
movement would feel really responsive
because the game engine is getting more
frequent updates but the on-screen image
could often look blurry and kind of
rubbish because it just wasn't able to
keep up not the case even without you
LMB so being able to take advantage of
g-sync the experience of gaming on the
XP 270 hu is absolutely fantastic ok
hold on a minute here Linus there's got
to be a catch nothing in life is free
and even if you claim gaming in front of
this monitor is lights-out amazing with
very little perceptible motion blur no
perceptible input lag better image
quality thanks to its srgb IPS panel etc
there's got to be something all right
well let's try then shall we if I had to
come up with a reason not to drop your
other plans and buy this monitor right
the second I guess it
be this look how far we've come in the
last couple of years
monitors are changing at a rate that we
haven't seen in years and new
technologies like AMD freesync and open
and lower-cost competitor to gsync that
only works on AMD cards right now are
only just emerging so if you're afraid
something better will come out very soon
then this is a lot of money to spend on
a display but the other side of that
coin is that this is a really amazing
monitor that I believe any gamer would
be happy with the first no compromises
display that I've seen and the one that
I'll be using for gaming until a 34 40
by 1440 144 Hertz IPS ultra wide
equivalent steps on to the playing field
well done Acer well done which I guess
brings us to AA Dollar Shave Club
