never heard of um actually here this is
this is awesome because I happen to have
a property here every motherboard
manufacturer wants to talk about where
is it oh look at that I picked the one
motherboard box that happens to not have
it on it but either way every
motherboard manufacturer wants to talk
about how they've got special
high-powered USB ports that will allow
you to charge your iPad or tablet or
other high-powered device through your
front USB but I came across a tool over
masseuse that is am compatible with all
motherboards and PCs including notebooks
called a I charge now this is not the
same as on/off charge which allows you
to charge devices using certain USB
ports usually it's one internal pin
header even when this PC is powered down
but this one does work well it says
available to charge on any mode but it
depends on blah blah blah s States and
yeah ok anyway this one has nothing to
do with what kind of USB port nothing to
do with what kind of motherboard or even
what kind of system you have all you
have to do is install the app which is
very very lightweight and takes about a
second to install then just for the sake
of illustration I'm using an MSI
motherboard here guys so this is a Big
Bang X power x58 motherboard this is
before anyone started really
implementing these on and off charge
features and high powered USB ports for
charging tablets so I thought that it
was hopeless and that I couldn't charge
my tablet
on my PC but it turns out that I can and
I'll show you guys where to get it as
well as C so there it goes it is
charging it doesn't charge particularly
fast because this isn't a high powered
USB port or anything like that but it
does charge which is all I really asked
for so that I don't have to set up one
of the wall warts and all you do is go
to a vent on a comm B slash 2010 slash
AI underscore
charger and download it and it uses up
let's see how much RAM does AI charger
use AI charger well it uses a whole 1.7
Meg's of RAM so you should be okay on
that front and there is zero
configuration in fact it just sits here
in the taskbar if you want to move a
little bit closer it just sits here in
the in the system tray rather not the
taskbar you can't even click on it or
open it or anything like that
and just allows you to charge higher
power devices when you plug them in so
thank you for checking out this little
limas tech tip on how to charge your
tablet whether it's an iPad or whether
it's an Android device off of any
computer you want just using this simple
little app and like huge thanks to a
soos for not artificially locking this
down to their own products that is like
major points in my book and I hope you
guys see it the same way don't forget to
