today I know it's just a fan but there's
actually a lot of innovation in this fan
that I think is absolutely fascinating
so they're calling this the an tech
advance true quiet pro 120 they're
saying it provides maximum cooling with
minimal noise which is pretty much the
same claim that anyone who makes a fan
pretty much claims okay but I think they
have something to back it up here this
is a 600 / 1200 rpm fan on the back it
says unique frame family provides
superior airflow and minimal turbulence
and I'll show you guys why that is and
that's pretty much it that's it for the
packaging so let's open it up and let's
have a look at this fan now I've already
had one of these open I don't know if it
was this one or if it was the other one
but I've already had one of them open
and I'm gonna tell you guys I'll spoil
the surprise I am very very impressed by
this particular fan because it does a
whole lot of things right and not a
whole lot wrong so first thing let's
have a look at the accessories so we've
got a molex 4 pin 2 3 pin adapter with
an RPM monitoring wire we have 6 6
fan mount grommet things that are very
robust feeling so you go ahead and you
thread that through the fan and then
whatever you happen to want to mount it
to let's go ahead and put that there you
can pull that through it's not gonna
break how many of you guys have had
these break on you before and there you
go you're going to be able to mount that
to whatever you want with a nice
vibration proof mount so speaking of
vibration proof let's get to the fan
itself on both sides of the fan
it has sorry about that guys okay so
we've got great quality grommets on both
sides of the fan which means so whether
you are mounting it somewhere as an
intake or whether you're mounting into
the back Y is an exhaust you're gonna
have a nice vibration I won't say
vibration proof but very low vibration
mount I mean can you guys see how much
moisture is in there I'm expecting very
little vibration to be transferred from
the fan to whatever it happens to be
mounted to in this situation okay
another cool thing to show you guys here
is the fact that the fan is actually
mounted very
very very very loosely but the frame
itself in spite of being so small is
still very solid so you can actually
take your give me give me two seconds
I'll be back just kind of look at the
fan for a second I'll be back I'm going
to show you guys what I would consider
to be a low quality fan so this one this
guy right here
so check out how much flex I'm gonna try
and apply about the same amount of force
so check out how much flex there is in
the frame can you see that at all
can you see the flex okay so now I'm
gonna show you guys this antique fan in
spite of its small frame you can see
it's probably got about the same amount
of flex to it and that's just comes from
higher quality materials there's nothing
you can really substitute for that when
you are building a fan okay next thing
that's really cool check this out you
guys so I am going to line up the very
edge of the blades on this no-name fan
here hold on give me a second here guys
and what you are going to see hello
blades blades are not quite lined up
there we go what you're gonna see is
that the antique fan actually extends
past there with the blades so by cutting
away the frame an tech has cut they've
left the square frame here but they
actually have blades that go almost all
the way out to the edge of a 120
millimeter fan spec so the the confines
of a 120 mil in the inter spot they have
extended the fan almost completely to
the edge
they have also reduced the size of the
hub in the middle so what does that give
you that gives you more surface area for
well not really surface area but it
gives you more area to push air through
versus fans that have you know see this
gap here see they have this thicker
frame see the huge hub there's just not
as much space to push air around as
there is with something like the true
quiet Pro 120 the true quiet pro 120
also includes a low and a high setting
on a little switch here that's pretty
typical of an Tek and then a sleeved 3
pin connector now why am I so excited
about this because when I plugged
this thing is so freakin quiet I have
been wondering for the longest time
because it doesn't seem to me that you
need a motor this big to drive a fan
which weighs almost nothing at 1,200 to
1,500 rpm so Antec has gone ahead and
they've put in a not very powerful motor
in here because powerful motors are
going to be louder okay so they've put a
not very powerful motor in here that is
capable of starting the fan so once it
started this fan actually has a ton of
momentum because of the weight that is
attached to the outside of the blades so
this fan here well whatever this isn't
gonna be an exact demo but this fan
stops spinning fairly quickly because
there's not a whole lot of weight to it
whereas this fan once it gets going up
I'm having trouble holding it without
without touching the fan oops this fan
is gonna spin for a much longer time and
so it doesn't take much force to keep it
spinning which means you can use a nice
quiet motor to keep it going that
doesn't have that grinding that promoter
that running noise so all you hear is
the gentle whoosh of air which I have
tested in real-life scenario already and
it does work so thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look and
gushing about the true quiet Pro 120 I'm
very impressed by this thing very
excited it is a boon to enthusiasts of
silence everywhere Thank You Antec for
releasing it and don't forget to
