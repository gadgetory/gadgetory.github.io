1985 or something along those lines and
these are the original garage door
openers so I was like you know what I
want to get for myself I'm gonna get
myself a nice fancy smart garage door
opener and I bought this unit from
Chamberlain on Amazon for I don't knows
like a few hundred bucks or something it
had good reviews or whatever everything
seemed hunky-dory I got it out I started
opening it up and I'm reading the manual
and I make it all the way to this page
in the manual that refers me to a
website that then I scroll like way down
I click a thing and finally I find out
that the if this then that integration
for Chamberlain's garage door openers is
a subscription service Jake can you be
my can you be my you know expert
consultant here for a minute is there
any reason that if this then that
integration would require a subscription
like a paid subscription a paid
subscription no I don't think so no no
there really isn't so I could afford it
it was only $1 a month
but the reality of it is that
Chamberlain we're gonna do it ourselves
we're gonna take these ancient garage
door openers we're gonna make them smart
with the help of what like 30 bucks
worth of gear off alleys Express Amazon
they got that folks
Animas I got one more for you here this
guy you got this guy
what's this cost I these are like 30
bucks each
all right you probably would have better
off just paying the fee this is gonna
pay itself back in like five years it's
the principle of the thing
and speaking of the principle of the
thing madrenas Coffee madrenas blends
specialty cold brew coffee Xin 215 ounce
grabby no cans for your convenience and
you can check them out and use offer
code Linus we're gonna have that down
below to save 40% today or even tomorrow
but don't put it off like 40% goes crazy
so just to give you some idea how
overdue it is that's huge bang it worked
late well you can't you can't stop it
yeah you can't Oh
so let's start with the highly advanced
system for my garage door openers here
we've got these two doorbell ringers oh
they're not even better ten out of ten
do you even push the button know that
the buttons are loose so if you kind of
jiggle them around they kind of go every
once in a while they just so perfect and
they're definitely very very attached to
the wall Wow you can replace those you
know they're just regular switches look
at your Jake shot me with a Nerf dart
that we started then over here we've
basically got the safety sensitivity
like there's no there's no beam or
anything that's just like how hard it's
gonna push on you and then this is open
and this is closed but like I don't
really a loopy I don't really know what
that is it's like it's dripping grease
yeah do you get that on your car
meanwhile I'm storing this in here with
this like epic garage by the time this
video comes out this will not be in here
by the way guys so so don't break and do
this house yeah please so walk us
through what we've got here the basic
premise is this is a Wi-Fi switch it's
like those buttons over there but
instead it's got some relays here we're
gonna wire this up to your garage door
you just one of them and then you should
be able to just click a button on your
phone and it should actuate this and
that's all you got to do now does it
replace the hardware button it can do
both we can just run it in seriously but
in series but like together with it and
then because this isn't gonna tell us
whether the garage door is open or not
you're gonna have a second thing this is
from a company called roost they sent
this to us thanks for that
and they actually normally make these
for insurance purposes like your parents
your house insurance might require so it
logs like whether it was open or not at
the time that a theft occurred or
whatever yeah so we're just gonna stick
this on the garage door and we should be
able to on the app see if his garage
doors
then we've got this guy so this is a
little bit cheaper does that other one
you up to four yeah it was a four car
garage
rich people but you don't have to use
them for garages it can be like to turn
anything on really okay sure so this one
is just for single yes and then you just
take your micro USB there you go and you
can also just power it with a any five
volt power supply so you can use a
battery or a battery pack and this will
probably last for like months cool well
we're gonna plug it in step one just do
it step one step two magic happen keep
doing it so hold on a second do I need
to like are we even we're not even
getting into any high voltage wiring
here are we no this is literally none
it's 12 volt we need a flathead get a
little excited over there oh my god
that's the og screwdriver yeah I keep it
here now cuz I don't want to like get it
confiscated at the airport or something
that almost happened except this one
time this was amazing so what I did is I
took the bit out of it put it in here
they literally take it out of my bag and
go oh yeah it's a good thing this is
really one I'd have to take it
Oh Saved by the Bell you even for real
right now cuz meanwhile I've got all
this other stuff in here that's pointing
AC / DC 7 234 232 volt 10 amps at 250 AC
or 30 DC sure casual right so just like
all the things yeah okay what's the app
it's called II we link is there is there
is there a paid subscription for that
not ET integration are you sure it's
almost like it's a free API dear user
its dollar a month for IFTTT intergrate
and I'm just kidding it's not is there
somewhere we can plug this in that isn't
up there yeah yeah for sure I'll do over
here OOP ah lights we may put it in the
plastic it's just here while we test it
yeah I just want to not be standing on
top of a ladder while we try to set this
up okay power up the model then press
and hold pairing button for five seconds
until the LED indicator blinks twice and
on repeatedly what does blinks twice and
on repeatedly mean okay
oh yeah is okay make sure your phone in
the model aren't closer enough to Wi-Fi
router found second-generation device
hey hey yeah so if you click one of
those it should you should hear the
relay click hold on wait for it this is
sick yeah like 30 bucks if you only need
one it's lonely I think I checked it was
like nineteen dollars Canadian that's
awesome so now all we need to do is rip
this ghetto stuff I think you should
just leave those and then we can have it
also so if somebody needs to come in
here that doesn't have the app like
couldn't we just put this here and then
just splice in some wire I need to
figure out which ones because otherwise
if we put this up by the garage door
opener I'll grab the wires okay
do you get wire strippers uh yeah I got
wire strippers oh yeah yeah baby you got
lots of strippers oh oh even a little
multimeter you know they make like 1,500
on multimeters I'm sure they do for
people who are far more qualified to use
multimeters than I am I am so excited to
be able to open my garage door yeah like
honestly I'm excited for you sometimes
when I'm working oh my god scare me I'll
even see him there well he's been doing
his martial arts training oh man mini
ninja well I get my butt kicked
didn't leave much slack in those wires
hey
we should be replacing these at the same
time do you have any buttons uh Wow oh
so well that explains like why it's
broken it just fell apart so this just
pushes that onto there like that so you
actually know what we could probably
like fix it pretty easily this might
have just been put back together wrong
oh there we go yeah this is definitely
screwed this was assembled wrong this
was flipped around I think okay well
when I see this button is actually it's
fixed it's like fine now it's not loose
anymore yeah I can just put some hot
glue in and it'll be like fine I think
where's that screwdriver oh why do you
always make me do this it's really tight
every time I work with you I end up
reaching into your pocket frankly I've
had enough you've had enough when I tell
you you've had enough okay all right
maybe just tighten it a little more yeah
that was a nice technique I don't have a
ton of talents but I'm pretty good at
screwing things up every time you see
that wire that you don't want to pick up
just because you're so mad doesn't seem
like there's not a lot that can go wrong
honestly yeah I think it'll probably
work fine knock on wood
but you have to do the knocking it's
your house I think yeah probably do you
don't have to roll on this David this is
awful well you can just check yeah okay
you just go like this and then a light
goes on there you go okay it's one oh no
I meant like which of these three
oh well it's labeled oh is it yeah so
you've got your ground and then you've
got your know you've got NC which
usually stands for no connection I'm
gonna look up this video of this other
guy complicated
I'm in the shower wasn't me no once a
little over there wasn't me
we definitely left way too much wire on
that one yeah and it might actually
bridge that I guess it doesn't really
matter I should be okay
okay so plug it in just put that's it
smart garage door we click it again
before it closes
oh and it pauses and then click Oh have
to go down after that ok so now we just
have to wear the other one up yeah
should we cut let's cut these wires it
looks awful I can do that later ok but
you're never connect I'll do it I'll do
it
the first one that same done daeng
download pending why is this down okay
I'm gonna go stand closer to my access
point here what's going on oh yeah go
for it let's do it you just taking one
it was David's idea nope you have no
devices click to add a new device wait
to hear a beep then click next I'm
assuming there was a beep at some point
there's the beep Oh what are you doing
oh no it's connected so there it is volt
Wi-Fi battery good ok so now we have to
stick this okay so is it what is it like
an accelerometer that are like yeah it
has yeah okay that's cool you should
probably clean this off that's your
cleaning too I mean I have cloths well
oh now I got cobwebs on me Oh anyways
what did he put it on there already I
already wipe it off with my hand are you
doing I just played okay well thanks I
let me clean let me clean my hand off
No okay what would make this perfect is
if it just fell please don't fall off
its gonna make me look really stupid if
it does come on buddy yeah thank you so
that's it now I can control my ancient
garage doors and I can see if yeah heck
yeah we chest-bumping are we high five
high five okay No why not what no no you
weigh a lot more than okay go ahead okay
one two three the math drops sennheiser
HD 6xx headphones are one of my
favorites and they're one of math drops
all-time bestsellers with over 60,000
units sold they haven't changed the
drivers or the sound structure compared
to the HD 650 so you get a nice balanced
mid-range and natural sounding bass but
they did make one meaningful change
going from a ten-foot cable down to a
detachable 6 foot cable based on
community feedback it's got a 1/8 inch
plug that's versatile for everyday use
and it comes with a quarter inch adapter
as well as Sennheiser's long-term
support so don't miss out click the link

the spot when he said that's a pretty
good technique there with the
screwdriver I think we were screw these
