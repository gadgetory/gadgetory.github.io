my most boring unboxings to date so if
you don't like boring unboxings tune out
now I am going to be unboxing the
kingston valueram one by two gig memory
module so this is a value oriented
memory module and the reason that i
would bring this up is that kingston is
as you may or may not know one of the
largest suppliers of memory in the world
in fact if memory serves they are the
largest and their value ram is among the
most reliable ram out there I also just
like ok ok now I'll give you the real
reason I was in the warehouse I was
walking around I saw this I thought it
was pretty cool because I've never seen
a half-height dim before there I said it
so this value module actually seems to
have a cost-saving measure in place
where they are using a smaller PCB then
even a normal stick of RAM but they are
mounting the same oh I dropped it oh
that's really bad I hope this still
works ok why don't we do the accessories
first and then we'll get to the round
this is like my worst unboxing ever it's
a disaster ok so here's a warranty and
installation guide it's in about six
different languages as far as I can tell
from the back they show you do not drop
it on the floor when you're trying to
take it out of the box and mostly
install it directly into the RAM slot on
your computer press firmly on both sides
etc etc so that's cleverly packed right
in there and then the RAM stick itself
so you can see you've got your standard
eight memory chips on either side of
this module so they're on both sides
because this is a 2gig demand using the
high-density RAM chips that would be
required to do a single sided dim would
be not economical for a value ram SKU
you've got your little sticker there
don't remove it unless you want your
warranty to be void and I guess that's
about all there really was to say about
it thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the kingston valueram 2 gig
ddr2 800 module</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
