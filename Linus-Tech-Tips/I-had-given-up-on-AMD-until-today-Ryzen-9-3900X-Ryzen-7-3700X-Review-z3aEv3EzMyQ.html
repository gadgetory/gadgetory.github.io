Let's get this out of the way even the most ardent AMD fan knows that Intel is king when it comes to gaming and
AMD always has been and always will be nothing but a second choice for poor people and
everyone including myself has only themself to blame for getting
Wrapped up in the hype around the third gen Ryzen launch and jumping on the bandwagon too early
Let's throw up some numbers here. Shall we?
so as you guys can see here a simple die shrink was never going to a
Simple die shrink was hey
AMD is tied with Intel. Yeah that csgo that that that's known to favor Intel
yea well I mean...
Are you sure you labeled this crack C Intel goes here Andy goes here this is gaming
yea, usually
This is sure that's right
Could it be that Intel is behind AMD for gaming
We are gonna need to go a little bit deeper here folks
Speaking of deeper
If you ever want to take a deeper
Look at what's going on with your network connection GlassWire allows you to monitor your network activity and block
Badly behaving apps use offer code linus to get 25% off at the link in the video description
Let's do the technical stuff first at the core of this launch is Zen to AMD's aptly named next generation
Zen microarchitecture that incorporates a new chip litleo consisting of multiple
seven nanometer CPU dies and a dedicated 12 nanometer
IO die all
Joined together by an infinity fabric interconnect that runs at double the bandwidth of the previous generation in order to reduce latency
AMD has also thrown in a more efficient branch predictor much faster AVX support for super fast
frequency switching a feature that improves both performance and efficiency kind of like Intel's speed shift and
finally gain cache
One of the dumbest bits of branding that we've seen since super
graphics cards
as it turns out game cache is just marketing speak for doubling the amount of level three cache on the CPU the
Good news. Is that stupid name aside?
It does help feed rise ins hunger for extremely fast data access to the point where AMD claims that this
Optimization alone is worth double the benefit of going from ddr4
2666 all the way to 3600 on the previous generations
Improving matters even further third. Gen Ryzen now natively supports ddr4
3200 and has been seen overclocking as high as 5,100 megahertz to put that in perspective
First gen Rison was so picky about memory that for a while you needed
highend Samsung B-Die modules in order to hit thirty two hundred megahertz
By contrast third-gen ryzens new off die memory controller design has AMD claiming a sweet spot of ddr4
37:33, that's frankly astounding so they managed all this by optimizing trace routing to the CPU and
Decoupling the memory frequency from the Infinity fabric clock. That means that you're no longer
Overclocking the Infinity fabric when you overclock your memory
speaking of overclocking AMD's updated ryzen master utility provides full timing control while booted to the OS and
Lets you import and export those settings
Including settings that are generated by third-party rise in memory overclocking calculators
So if you've got a similar set up to an exported profile from someone, you know
Then you can actually use those numbers as a jumping-off point, which is really cool
We're hoping to follow up with a full overclocking guide but in a nutshell, it's pretty different but in a good way
There's even more that AMD is done here, too
But the TLDR is that this is far more than just a die shrink and it all adds up to a pretty hefty
Performance improvement and the crazy part is that's all before
We even get to the new motherboards
Now many 2nd generation and some 1st gen rising boards should get support for 3rd gen chips
but for the best experience
Andy is of course recommending their new x5 70 chipset with x5 70 supported devices
Including the chipset itself and the link that it has to the CPU are gonna run at PCI Express Gen 4
Which is capable of double the bandwidth of the previous generation
that means that high performance devices like multi gigabit network cards USB four controllers nvme storage and
Future graphics cards will be able to run their best on x5 70
Ok, that was a lot of new stuff to take in
so I'm just going to sum it up here AMD now has much faster course and
Making matters worse for Intel their modular approach to chip design has enabled them to pack in more of them today
Right now AMD has a 12 core
24 thread consumer CPU on store shelves and it's priced to match the core. I
999 hundred K with a measly eight cores and sixteen threads and
What's even crazier is it's got a hundred and five watt TDP?
Which Intel happens to measure at their base clock and AMD measures at their boost?
Of course, it's one thing to be told all of this and quite another to see it
So here's the test setup that we're using today
We're gonna be pitting the best that both teams have to offer against each other with the most current software and firmware
patches on as equal footing as possible
It's worth mentioning up front that we did observe some interesting behavior when testing between ddr4 3,200 and 3,600
on both Intel and AMD here
We settled on 3,600 for this review, but let us know if you'd like to see a follow up on performance at different memory speeds
Now, let's finally get back to those gaming charts
immediately we see that not
everything is rise and friendly, but
AMD has closed the gap
Considerably over second gen with even are much less expensive rise in 7 sample pulling off
respectable numbers compared to Intel's flagship consumer core I 9
9900 K
but
Mere numbers do not tell the whole story here take Battlefield 5, for example
This looks like a clear win for Intel that is until we fire up OBS in the background and start streaming our gameplay
Now AMD is on top now. You might think that that's simply because AMD has more cores and a more efficient interconnect, but
Look closely, err. We saw a lot of run to run variation in framerate
Seemingly at random
What this suggests to us is that the CPU isn't always using the most efficient group of cores to run the game
Assigning the game to only one of the guys made things a lot more stable and faster
So with some windows scheduler or game optimization, we think AMD could have significantly more performance on there
speaking of more performance
productivity is risings traditional stomping ground and
Stomping I think would be a generous way to describe Intel's treatment under AMD's heels here at worst
AMD roughly matches Intel in per thread performance
while also having
More cores at the same price and at best it's like watching that South Park episode where the kids hockey team plays the Detroit Red
Wings
Check out this mozilla firefox' compile test. That is the Rison
737 hundred x running over a minute and a half faster than intel's flagship consumer core. I nine ninety
nine hundred k now normally when we run through these graphs we feel like we need to provide voiceover commentary about
Which kinds of workloads lean more towards which product or if you're this kind of professional?
Maybe you should consider this
but
Today we kind of are
Just killing time while the graphs roll because it's as simple as if you've got real work to do on your computer
You should buy a rise in third gen and the good news keeps rolling aim these thermal performance
Which can finally be measured without applying a temperature offset calculation is pretty decent the new chipset at cosy
but manageable temperatures
Which is especially relevant because AMD's precision boost
Unlike intel's turbo boost does not have a duration limit so much like a GPU
Reisen, third gen will keep boosting for as long as it can within its thermal and power budgets in other words these things
Are designed to redline?
Under a prime95 small FFT load that translates to a sustained frequency
Not a whole lot higher than base clock
But that's okay because under a more realistic scenario like a long blender render rise in third
Gen CPUs managed to consistently stay a few hundred megahertz
Over base when we try disabling the power limits and enabling the most aggressive options for precision boost overdrive
Things did heat up quickly and I suspect that voltage
tweaking is going to be the main way to get better over clocks on these higher and rising chips with
Upgraded cooling of course required leading us perfectly to one of the major
Downsides of the x5 70 platform the active cooling usually in the form of a small fan
required to control the heat output of the motherboard chipset
It's a real bummer for me to see this cooling trend come back because tiny
proprietary cooling fans tend to be one of the least reliable components in a PC
which means that if it fails
the best case is that your jury-rigging a cooler to limp along and the worst case is that your motherboard throttles your performance or
Cooks itself before you realize that anything is wrong
Unfortunately this cooling is a necessary evil
Apparently due to the additional power required by PCI Express Gen 4
The good news is that at least it does make a difference for storage throughput right now
We're looking at nearly 2 gigabytes per second worth and we could expect more in the future
It's also worth noting here that even while we were hitting our er s SSD with for
Continuous looping file copies of about a gig of photos each crystal disk marked sequential right numbers
Barely dipped below what you might consider reasonable for an entry-level nvme SSD
Without any additional load on it not too shabby
but PCI Express Gen 4 seems to contribute to toasty operation on the other side of the link as well and our SSD got
Really hot during benchmarking despite its massive heatsink
I think we're gonna have to start coming up with some really creative
SSD cooling solutions folks because while you want the controller to be cool the mend itself actually if it gets too cool
It's reliability gets hurt
anyway, that's a conversation for another time for now now that we've made our way through performance it's time to talk value and there's just
No way to dance around this Intel
Must adjust their prices the Rison 730 700 X mostly matches the kora 999 hundred K blow-for-blow
But is priced lower than a core i7
9700 K which lacks hyper-threading, so it's a bad story now and we haven't even looked at AMD's less expensive
Overclocking capable chips. Remember every Rison is unlocked or AMD's upcoming 16 core Rison 3rd
Gen now strictly speaking if you're a gamer into can
technically still claim to be on top and the core i7
9700 K could still appeal to you if you're all about that raw frame rate
But Intel's margin of victory is very thin compared to what we're used to seeing and we're only expecting the gap to shrink
So if you do almost anything else on your computer, it gets pretty tough to justify
so then guys
This is it take in the moment because for the first time in over a decade
AMD is essentially on top of the consumer CPU race and much like in the Athlon 64 days
intel has
No meaningful response on their roadmap
meaning that it is Intel who is going to have to slash their prices in order to stay competitive and
The craziest part of all of this is that with team blue still trying to ramp up ten nanometer production
AMD may end up having a response for that
By the time it rolls out
So the final word and I really can't stress enough how important this is is whether you'd like AMD or hate AMD
They're back in a big way, and you should be absolutely
freaking stoked because competition is
Always good for the consumer
Speaking of good Ifixit's essential electronics toolkit is compact and goes anywhere you go and can be used to fix almost anything
