need a laptop for school can you make
enough dough mowing lawns that's what
we're going to find out on this episode
of laptop or bust the Vitesse Mouse from
Phoenix features a lightweight design
and in a vago 3310 optical sensor check
it out at the link in the video
description first up is lawn mower we've
got a gas mower you can go electric or
manual but electrics gonna slow you down
and manual means you're gonna have to
rake up all the clippings as you go so
ideally a gas mower is the way to be and
then we have to weed whackers both of
these are electric we don't need to we
just have to because I guess add them so
we might as well bring them and a long
extension cord because you don't know
where people outlets are going to be
yard bags and rakes this way we can take
away any of the grass clippings that are
leftover from the weed whackers a broom
for cleaning up the sidewalk because
you'll want to leave people with grass
covered sidewalks and a spare gas can so
we can fill up the lawnmower extra
trimmer line and a clipboard huh a fresh
haircut and a clipboard says
professionalism nothing on it lots of
water we're going to be in the Sun we're
both wearing pants it's gonna get hot
we're gonna sweat a bunch gonna need to
rehydrate an entire pack of ear plugs
you know for hearing protection of all
our ears and orifices and a couple
garbage bags just in case we got a pulse
and garbage away that's pretty much it
let's get going now a car with a trailer
for getting from job site to job site
and hauling equipment is ideal it
increases your maximum range and means
that you don't have to carry equipment
with you while you're cold calling and
knocking on doors but obviously if
you're not able to borrow something like
that that dramatically increases the
cost of your business and may not be
something that you can afford until
little bit later a good solution to this
problem would be some type of wagon that
you can fit your lawnmower in and
ideally your weed whacker as well they
are pretty cheap and you could just pull
them from door to door if you're
somewhere in suburbia walking from
door-to-doors are going to be that long
anyways it shouldn't be that hard to do
so if there's anything that I learned
from my days of painting
counter-intuitively you don't want to go
after the people with the worst lawn
because they probably don't give a rat
and you definitely don't want to go
after people with the most manicured
lawn because they're probably doing it
themselves or they have a professional
service already this this is a prime
candidate because it's a little bit on
the long side there's some weeds in it
so they're probably not doing it that
regularly but you look at their house
they have flowers or Christmas lights
they don't completely know I care so
it's a good door to knock on I just
pushed the clipboard under the mower
oh come out clipboard oh so what do you
think for front front door should be
wearing our safety goggles I don't think
you should be wearing our safety goggles
whatever we do decide to wear on our
face like I'm gonna have my glasses in
my pocket and gloves I want to have like
strategically hanging out of my pocket
so that it looks ah ready for use ready
for use but I'm not doing it yet you
have to pay me to put the gloves on ah
alright okay yeah good call so I won't I
think we should have the safety goggles
with us though that looks really
professional like having safety
equipment like your sunglasses are safe
to go because we're both gonna be
wearing I plan to actually wear
sunglasses but I wanted like the safety
goggles to be kind of part of the
uniform we can do that I was just gonna
have my sunglasses kind of hanging out
of my pocket and we don't want anything
that covers up our super professional
slogan yeah well I'm not hanging it from
yeah yeah I know I know
wonderful naming choice I really wanted
a W but Yvonne screwed up the shirts
like we mow your grass but I know you're
probably
okay all right it has been a long time
since I have died like door-to-door
sales me too thank you madam you have
experienced my door-to-door sales was
like literally elementary school trying
to get that thing from the flyer you
actually did it professional okay oh
there's no cars in the driveway so
that's a bad sign there's another pro
tip for you guys car in the driveway
means they're at home usually I mean
someone's at home well that was
anticlimactic
I guess we'll move on to the next place
land that one unsurprisingly due to
there being no cars in the driveway
nobody home try the next one yeah the
next one with no cars in the driveway
thank you okay yeah should also know
it's painful so it should be okay
we're mowing lawns yeah we're charging
thirty dollars we'll do it right now
we've got all of our gear in our trailer
it's just parked around the corner and
that's pretty much the whole thing we're
actually well what we're actually doing
is we're creating a video about earning
money in the summer as a student and
we're evaluating different methods of
doing it some today we're trying going
once and that's pretty much all there is
to say so that house did seem like they
would have been interested and it did
seem like we were gonna get some work
there but unfortunately they actually
already have a company who's going to be
coming and doing their lawns they just
moved in so that would have been a prime
candidate we're doing a we're lowing mom
mowing once no okay thanks hello
we're on mowing lawn six thirty dollars
well we've got our gardener coach you do
nobody home son claims he already mowed
the lawn I don't think his mom check so
we're already discovering that the right
now nature of when we want to do the
lawns is a bit of a disadvantage we've
had some people who I think would have
been interested but just they're busy
right now or they their lawn doesn't
need to be mowed just yet but still
feeling confident to make sure that
we're on the same page we mow with the
mower and then we go around with the
weed whacker and do the edging and we
we'll take away the clippings with us
thank you very much all right let's do
it
well I was feeling a little discouraged
before but um I mean hey we're seven
eight houses in and no-haggle three
books I mean I think that that's a good
competitive rate so you know I think
we're I think we're being very fair
about our rates let's just get our
trailer of equipment pulled up here and
we're ready to rock I'm excited yeah
sure okay we'll be we'll be right back
our trailers just grabbing lunch so
we'll be back in probably about 15
minutes okay thank you
hi who's your mama your daddy oh my kids
all know not to answer the door when I'm
not home but you know whatever cold
calling can be a bit of an emotional
rollercoaster so we went from being like
depressed to look we booked a job to now
kind of nothing's happened so on the
bright side at the rate we're going if
you can book like three jobs a day if
you were by yourself
you didn't least be making them a wage
which is a whole lot better than no job
at all anyway here's our equipment let's
get going
protip Garth it's going to be hot it's
not uncool to wear sunblock I mean it is
if you wear it like this but we all knew
I was uncool already
protip have your gear ready including
extension cords when you arrive at the
person's house you don't want to look
like an idiot standing outside
untangling a cord that you could have
had prepared before you show it up
protip so familiarize yourself with your
equipment before you start this one is
supposed to auto feed the filament but
there's actually a manual advanced
button here so I'm going to hand this
back over to Luke and you should be
should be ready to go with the full
length of his cutting line as we said
earlier we brought a lot of water I
would also recommend trying to have
something clipped to you being able to
take sips and drinks as you go it's
pretty sweet then you don't have to stop
working stopping working is bad
protip this guy is a pretty sweet car
there's also rocks right next to grass
right beside the pretty sweet car maybe
don't do that if you try to get them to
move at first or just move on and tell
them but it later on do not screw up the
person's car or any property for that
fact let's see how big the backyard is
something I probably should have checked
never thing to be a professional in this
start fairly large okay good
little extras like walking around in the
yard and picking up garbage or loose
rocks might seem like they're cutting
into your margins on the first job but
remember guys going a little bit further
could help one time jobs turn into
regular repeat business and for certain
things like removing rocks from the lawn
hey you'll only have to do it once and
be it keeps your equipment safe so it's
not damaged and you can continue to pull
low bonds for the rest of the day
so there you have it it's an hour later
we're sweaty er we're dirtier and we are
$30.00 Richard no this is not quite
minimum wage here in Canada when you
consider that there were two of us
working here but we have cash in hand
and we're ready to continue our day this
is kind of a do as I say not as I do
thing but make sure you're packing
yourself a bag lunch it not only wastes
money when you go out to eat like say
for example at Subway but it wastes time
that you could be spending knocking on
doors or mowing lawns so last time we
made the mistake of giving our flat rate
quote before we had seen the backyard
yeah that was not great it was pretty
messy and there was a lot of Edgington
this time we plan to do the exact same
thing because we're trying to make a
video not create a lawn mowing business
oh yeah something for you guys to
consider we'll be right back after these
messages
you know what makes you look
professional in addition to a clean
haircut and a clipboard a clean shave
and if you're a member of Dollar Shave
Club
you can have one affordably and
comfortably every day of the week
just by being a member Dollar Shave Club
delivers razors and other high-quality
bathroom supplies directly to your door
once per month and you get to save money
and speaking of saving money they've
actually got a special offer right now
you can get a free month of the
executive razor when you buy a tube of
dr. Carver shave butter so the first
time they've ever done a promo like this
and once you try Dollar Shave Club
you'll be a proud member like millions
of others I guess the reason they're
doing it is that they figure once you
try dr. Carver's shave butter you'll be
hooked it's got a conditioning formula
made of high quality natural ingredients
and leaves your skin soft and smooth not
to mention it goes on clear so you can
actually see what you're doing Dollar
Shave Club also has their one wipe
Charlies peppermint scented butt wipes

available in the US Canada and Australia
so go check it out and take advantage of
the promo at the link in the video
description hi there
give a moment
Holloway okay I'll leave your look
thanks a lot
hi they're doing lawn mowing and edge
trimming for 30 bucks
no thank you
don't had a no soliciting sign we're
doing lawn mowing and trimming yep okay
thank you it's been a while since we've
got a fight okay
we're doing lawn mowing and trimming and
stuff they're gonna be ready for some
nudity make it dude my dad's on the door
you never know
it's not going to be hard to do a fail
montage of my efforts here anything I
keep thinking wow we've been like at
this all day you know we're gonna run
out of time but I think time just really
drags when you're doing this because I
will look back and it's been like I
think it's been an hour it's been like
10 minutes this would be a water grass
turn
do you think you could get closer to
like a six out of ten creepy because
right now you're at about an eleven
Brendon so I guess I'm to believe that a
house with literally five cars in the
driveway in front of it has nobody home
our recurring frustration for us today
has been prime candidates that are not
home but again if this is something that
you're doing on a longer term basis then
you should definitely have a bunch of
fliers that you can leave on homes those
kinds of follow up leads will be
incredibly valuable as you try and build
your customer base over the course of
the summer much more houses still no
bites no call from Linus so I'm assuming
he's not doing any better either
unfortunately so it hasn't been the most
productive afternoon ever what we
realized is that if you want to see
every house walking is fine because the
distance between the houses actually
isn't that far in a typical suburban
neighborhood but if you want to skip
over the ones that are already perfectly
manicured or where the owner obviously
doesn't care then having a bit of a
faster mode of transportation helps a
lot I was able to hit probably three
times to four times as many promising
leads with a bike versus what I was able
to do on foot so in spite of doing our
marketing at what I would consider to be
a sub optimal time of day in spite of
not having any fliers or a phone number
to give anyone to contact us back we
still managed to book our second job of
the day for this charming couple and
it's time for us to get to work this
pile of mushroom manure stays you have
to pay money for this they don't want us
to take it away they just asked that we
exercise you know common sense when it
comes to where the obvious but you well
apparently this was a problem with a
previous Carter this looks like a weed
is not here is a rosebush that is going
to be transplanted don't go in there
because there are some flowers in there
so she needs to weed okay I think we're
clear
so it's become obvious to us now looks
like this job is going to take anywhere
from 20 to 30 percent longer than our
first one even though we quoted it the
same because it's about the same square
footage that it's going to take a little
while to really get the hang of quoting
these things at the very start of your
endeavor borrowing the clients lawnmower
using a cheap lawnmower or borrowing one
from a friend may be viable but if
you're serious about doing this for the
entire summer or even multiple summers
the main features that I look at from my
experience are going to be the size of
the cutting blade so the wider the
better for large lawns the smaller the
less expensive and the better for tight
lawns with a lot of narrow places that
you have to work as well as the grass
bag on the back that saves you a lot of
cleanup and the front wheel drive gas
assisted push I mean yeah it sounds kind
of we'll see but if you're doing this
all day you'll thank yourself
so there we have it in about ten
man-hours yeah so five hours each
we made sixty bucks which is gonna be
like under minimum wage for most people
but that's also our first day first day
it assumes nothing about moving forward
being able to bring people on as
recurring customers so based on the
interest that I had about that from
people some people didn't want to talk
to me about today yeah but wanted to
talk about I also had a lot of people
that seemed like they would have been
been open to us undercutting them on a
recurring service but that doesn't make
sense for us doing a one-day thing
either so that could have been pretty
good yep so based on our rough numbers
it would take about five to six days to
make back what we spent on our startup
costs it would take about two and a half
to three weeks to make a thousand
dollars for our back to school laptop
and if we stuck with this for the entire
summer we could expect to make about
$3,500 assuming that the first couple
weeks is like feet to the pavement
running around cold calling like this
and after that you have mostly recurring
customers and assuming you can only do
about three to four lawns a day which
which you can do more than that
and like the the last lawn we mowed we
probably could have gotten his neighbors
if we wanted to do recurring stuff as
well so you can do more than that it
depends on the density of the houses and
the density of the customers that yeah
and the other thing is once you're
working on something weekly or even
bi-weekly you won't run into something
that's quite as far gone is that we
could do that place in an hour which is
what we estimated if it was in the
condition that it would be in a week
especially because I wouldn't have had
to spend any time on the driveway yep
and that took so much of mine so overall
laptop or bust yeah I'm going laptop
yeah definitely a couple of them if she
wanted that for some reason so thanks
for watching this episode of laptop or
bust I hope you guys enjoyed it please
leave a comment letting us know what you
thought this is a pretty different video
for us so yeah let us know hit the like
button all that good stuff and
we should go by ourselves like some
Slurpees or something we should all go
out for Slurpees all right good work for
the everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
