and thus crackling I started off the
morning by picking up this case and a
fan and a PowerBar I'll explain why the
power bar in a little bit but first
things first I need to do a case swap I
didn't realize the bottom hard drive
cage was riveted in that will have to be
removed but it's fine for now
I bought this core 3000 but it's dusty
and gross as hell none of the pictures
you had on Craigslist showed how dusty
it was but it's still a nicer overall
case than the one that I had and I
didn't have any time left to buy
anything else so I was like whatever my
just want to spend my money on it
honestly if I had more time I might not
even even accepted it I probably would
have accepted it I just would have
hopefully had more time to clean it
what fractal Josh will say when he sees
that I mutilated his case within like
minutes of having it I'm gonna say I
thought you had style man
stop making Linus look good what am I
gonna see next for me socks and sandals
just remember buddy Karma's a bitch
trying to get the pump and the radiator
higher so they can clear the power
supply just fill up your computer you
just be like alright except you won't
have to fill it up because the computers
going too short when each other turn it
on so don't worry about it you know I
don't even care anymore as long as the
loop works screw the computer what's
going to end up happening here is I'm
going to end up gluing a whole bunch of
these cables not intentionally but it's
going to happen a whole bunch of those
cables are going to be glued together
then I just have to try to use whatever
is available to me to try to make it
soft leaking I have a tiny bit more
epoxy not much though and I have one
full pack of sugar ooh and one and a
quarter possibly a big stuff of more
sugar the chances of this right here not
leaking are like 1% I 199 percent belief
that it's going to leak I mean can you
imagine if I have to present a leaky
system to the judges so we need a bigger
piece of copper from the metal Mart to
put over top of our CPU here now was
that a WTF look or what I just realized
I'm holding an invoice for one of their
competitors that batters me I just
realize it is not well for what it's
worth the thing we have isn't going to
work I don't know not the stuff you made
for us the other day yeah maybe
basically that yeah but three and
five-eighths by three and five-eighths
okay so we're we're hooped then let's go
to metal market and up where is this oh
thank you letter Street
we're on its way above it sponsored boss
that's the Colossus all right
can nothing go right today
and now there's a freaking train
absolutely brilliant
so we're just going to sit here wait for
a train to go through completely the
center of Langley City everywhere we
shop people keep telling me they hope I
have a great day
not having a great day this put me by
every possible way of accounting for it
over budget we couldn't find the
mounting hardware again so just going to
whoa whoa wait a minute
Linus is cheating wait a minute why am i
acting surprised introducing Luca
Vinnie's all new patented power pad
equipped with a six foot cable to pull
yourself in super far away yeah your
stuff that isn't gonna work at all it's
gonna be covering of water and metal
it's gonna short itself out and then
short itself out again
I'm gonna go leak test it almost almost
this works
and whatever leaked didn't actually leak
much I don't even know what it is
because the cloth-like didn't even get
wet really how we watch long enough I'm
bound to do something clever eventually
copy sugar
new plan
we're going to find a much bigger object
to coil around maybe one of these
five-gallon buckets and we are going to
make an external coil that we put on the
side panel here we have no choice
I don't know if it'll fit it will fit in
it what if we went right on top
we kind of have like spread it out a
little bit actually that could kind of
work
alright so John is sleeping so we're
gonna try and get our copper tubing
inside our case somehow let's drill a
hole I'm sure someone's gonna point this
out I know this is a wood hole saw I
know this is steel I know that's a
problem just so we're all on the same
page this puppy okay let's go see if
John's home awake I'm gonna send this
video to John when we're done and he's
just gonna be like what the hell he's
gonna be he's going to be amazed that we
got as far as we did without his help
okay so we've finished cutting out the
little cutaway that we need for the caps
that are next to the socket but what we
haven't done is actually finished the
surface of the CPU block where it's
going to make contact with the CPU so
for that we actually need to change the
bit so this is what we're using yeah
this little guy here is it's more for
milling that means that there's a
cutting blade here and a cutting blade
over here and that goes in takes the
place of this little bit here so it goes
in like this and then I Center
everything and I just set it up so it
the next time it goes past here it's
going to be taking a bit of thous clean
this up it'll make it look like it you
got it in the store
now the college-educated among you will
have probably noticed that there are
some definite marks on the bottom of the
block that's actually not as important
as having a flat surface because our
thermal con
pound is going to fill these little
micro scratches in the surface here
smooth those out too oh we can do that
too
yeah yeah yeah good old-fashioned
sandpaper not like I said none of the
judges will ever see and appreciate the
block manufacturing that went on all
they're going to see is this copper
plate with a couple not been sticking
out of it they're not going to they're
not going to know what's going on under
the hood here so I want the audience to
at least appreciate the magnificence of
our water block here now we could have
done better if we've done certain things
and I'm aware of the things that we
could have done better like for example
having a rubber gasket sealing this or
not using mixed metals but hey for a
homemade block that we know nothing
about its performance yet pretty darn
good someone might be wondering how you
drain this loop the answer is you don't
ever do that it's impossible as far as I
can tell considering everything is epoxy
together it would literally be
impossible to in sleep unless you
inverted the computer and then poured it
out of there but if you're going to do
that this stuff at the bottom isn't
fixed and everything's probably going to
break I'm just I'm stuck here for a
while
I have to hold each side of this tightly
so that water doesn't come through so
the epoxy can hopefully dry how long
does it take usable strength in eight
hours
we're kind of we're kind of stuck for
about 30 minutes here so all that's left
is to solder our tubing onto the CPU
block fuse the CPU block with some kind
of a sealant probably just silicone
because we're not at the point where we
can do anything fancy anymore
due up our reservoir and build the
computer that's where we're at it is now
the end of the fourth day on scrap yard
Wars - the judges are going to have to
be extremely generous for me to get
anything resembling a competitive score
in this competition and give it one more
coat of epoxy but I think we're done I
think that's it yeah one more coat of
epoxy but I'm basically calling it right
now I was gonna do one more coat but I'm
finished I'll bring out to the garage
after this and just let it sit
all right so as you can see it's getting
dark Terrans gone home for the night
but John out of the graciousness of his
heart is still helping me because we
still have to attach the pump to the
reservoir and I think we've got a plan
wasn't my plan I think we've got a plan
that's going to work if she fits she
sits just like that all right now we
wanted a clear silicone for this but
Home Depot is a little closed at the
moment so we went with a white one it's
not as pretty but it should seal up just
nicely we'll know in half an hour we're
going to use our sealant and four screws
here to close up the block yeah then I
actually had almost no hand whatsoever
in actually making silicone seal yep
here we go
so it's finally pour time I have very
little confidence in this seal at the
for the power cord for the pump but at
the very least we can find out how
everything else is doing no obviously
kept a pump outlet that's the most
essential because worst case scenario
our judges aren't that water cooling
savvy so we could just we could just try
to get away with one here and just have
our water level down here okay so that
caulk is clearly dissolving either
because in half an hour it's not cured
enough or because it just plain wasn't
going to work for this oh I had 100%
silicone in my bathroom drawer our pump
doesn't have enough head pressure to
start our loop we might be able to tip
it to make it a little bit easier on our
pump the good news is our CPU block
isn't leaking yet so that's the good
news
there isn't much good news right now
that was all the good news I had whoa
hey look at that okay so basically what
we're doing right now is cleansing the
system of all the junk and debris and
and dissolved crap that's in there now
then what I'm going to do is take the
CPU block and the reservoir parts that
are bad apart redo them with silicone
let it set overnight and hope that by 24
hours they mean 12 hours for better for
worse this computer is liquid cooled
well you know what hold on hold on let's
go ahead and ask who you guys think is
gonna win I think Luke will win
scrapyard wares to the scrap earning
he's taller I think Luke will win the
and we all lose I think Luke is gonna
win scrap yours
sorry Linus love you both and myself
rooster who do I think is gonna win
think Luke is gonna win because just uh
I think Linus will win because he knows
how to climb trees which you know is
really important for building computers
after all
welcome to scrapyard wars to the finale
we're doing the format a little bit
differently this time because it's not
as simple as oh well looks benchmark it
and find out who wins so we actually
have a panel of four judges including
Taryn Brandon and the two NYX so one
person for each of us who toiled with us
through the entire endeavor and two
people who have never seen the system
first section is creativity worth ten
points next up is effectiveness worth
another ten points then aesthetics ten
more points acoustics ten more points
and finally overall just general
category ten points total of fifty the
overall is very much up to the judgment
of well the judges so if we did things
like went over time went over budget or
utilized lifelines so if we got outside
help with our project that we didn't
directly pay for then they're going to
have to factor that in to our scores I
would like to point out that it was
actually just four lifelines and going
over time and going over budget we're
actually like completely breaking
everything but it's okay
we'll move forward I guess so you guys
can actually come around here or facing
the system here first of all I would
like to welcome all the judges here
today to the unveiling of the ghetto fr
3000 your honor Dabney here first thing
that I would like to point out first
thing that I would like to point out is
the patent pending easy fill technology
so as you will see in a moment this goes
into the computer and is actually the
reservoir so you can fill the computer
directly or drain it to view directly
just to the top very easy to do another
thing in our patent-pending easy
technology is the were inspired by Tesla
technology so what we did was we
introduced the power panel not the power
wall but the power panel so on the back
of the computer here if you guys kind of
rotate around a little bit you can see
that there's a mounted power bar and
actually only one power cable actually
leaves the computer so you can plug plug
your monitor into there you can plug
your speaker's into there all of your
power can plug directly into the
computer with our patented
patent-pending easy power panel so once
you open the side of the case you
actually get to the challenging parts of
this build so you can see we spared no
cost I don't know if I'm going to
mention brand names but yes it is a
high-quality high-quality water ball
eco-friendly actually yes this is this
is a the lookk industries luk industries
yes as you can see here the benchmark is
currently running and we're at a not too
bad 55 degrees let's go ahead and see
what the judges think I actually
discovered something quite interesting
if you want to hop on over here I just
saw this little thing leaking a little
bit of water into the power supply oh no
I have real oil oh no
is this a functional build mmm it's not
we saw that water leaking straight into
the into the power supply which is not
good at that feature so honestly how bad
do we know that leaking okay so aside
from our bias judge we think that the
build may be functional if he fixes the
link but at this point we're not
entirely sure
ladies and gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen
gentlemen you've seen the zero now
you're gonna see the hero
welcome to the unveiling of the winner
of scrapyard Wars 2 my system is
horrible
oh good this is the uber cooler magic
machine 5000 it features what I call and
this is my personal trademark the hmmmm
what do I call it I remember what I call
it and this is a copper coil cooling
system or CCS for short so let's start
by firing up the system just to
demonstrate that it does in fact work
you can see here at the front of my case
all Bay's are populated by either a
drive or a bay cover
I also have an eSATA port for
outstanding connectivity very modern two
USB 2.0 ports my air intakes are here
this door folds out more than a typical
door you can see it's on two hinges so
that if you accidentally bump it it
doesn't break off as easily quiet huh I
think that's a 10 out of 10 for
acoustics not that I can tell the judges
too much about how to judge the system
but that's a 10 out of 10 now you can
clearly see the copper coil is very
stable okay this is the moment everyone
brace your space yourselves this is a
thing of beauty in here okay hold on
there we go
you see that security it doesn't lock
but it's so hard to remove you'd think
it was locked so this my friends is the
heart and soul of this machine now there
is some water down here that is old
water that is old water from this last
night when this was still leaking now I
have to confess I did go a little bit
over time probably about 18 to 20 hours
overtime now we've gone with the what I
call a camel top system where the
cooling hump is located on top
of the system instead of using fittings
soldered or braised to the ends of our
copper we have actually just zip tied
tubing directly onto our copper pipe
actually it seems to be working okay is
approximately another innovative
cost-saving measure and I'm saving this
one is the fact that the CPU block is
using sawed off pieces of this tubing
soldered to the copper top of our fully
custom CNC cut water block as fittings
so we brought our budget by returning
about $40 worth of fittings that we had
already purchased by returning it we
brought our total spent on the water
cooling down to 198 dollars just shy of
the 200 mark for our system we paid 280
and I bought some Ninjago ninjas that I
was planning to put in it but they
weren't they weren't very posable and I
forgot if you want to come over here
judges and have a look at where we're
sitting we've been under load for about
seven minutes while I've been talking
and we're sitting at around 87 degrees
on the CPU which gets us fully turbotap
on our core i7 930 which is a very high
heat output CPU by the way full
performance not the lowest temperatures
but incredibly quiet with the CPU
actually being passively cooled by the
copper loop but wait there's more if you
had a little bit more money to spend
than we did you could get yourself a
room fan oscillating room fan right
there cools the coil cools you cools the
coil cools you hot summer day computers
good you're good everyone's good and
that is my presentation Thank You judges
I think it's
time the judges pick a winner and pick a
sore loser for loot system 138 points
the possible total scoring for Linus's
system out of 200 100 131 yes I can't
when you got that close to me let's
actually face got a lifeline almost a
whole day of extra time thanks for
watching scrapyard Wars 2 we will
definitely be back with more special
scrapping like in scratch like in
scribble like instant like your scrap
button and we could have a special
celebrity guest on the next episode of
scrap yard very a very hard nipples
yeah just see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
