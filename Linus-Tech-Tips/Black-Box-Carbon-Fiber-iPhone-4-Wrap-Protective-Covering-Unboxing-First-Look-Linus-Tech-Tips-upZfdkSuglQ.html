my ancient blackberry 8703e so i look at
this i even still have the original box
and accessories and everything pretty
cool but no longer relevant so today I'm
going to be unboxing a cover or a case
for my iphone 4 it has carbon fiber body
armor for the ultimate protection fit
and durability 360 degree protection
prevents drop calls due to antenna
attenuation now I have actually run into
this already with my phone the
receptions not as good as my ancient
blackberry real carbon fiber look and
feel precision cut to fit the iphone 4
and don't forget is it it is engineered
and made in canada and you can also feel
me on the back according to the package
so yeah i think what they mean is that
you can feel the you know the case on
the back of the package let's just open
this up and we will find out if its
quality i'll also install it and then
i'll i'll show it one side once i
finished installing it so we have a
little screen cleaner as well as a
little application square and a screen
protector alright that looks pretty good
so far and then oh I bent it or it was
benched time it's hard to say which so
I'll install this and I'll see if that
impacts the performance of the black box
carbon fiber body armor it did take a
little while to install and get it just
right I actually think it should come
with an assistant you know maybe like a
small child who can apply the stickers
for you because it's very difficult to
get them on straight but now that I've
applied it i went from getting one bar
of reception in my office to three bars
because i'm not i'm not bridging the
antennas anymore and it also looks
pretty cool i did not apply the screen
protector because I don't really care
it's a very very sturdy piece of glass
and I'm not too
read about scratching it but it gives it
a nice little look and it's also a
little bit more grippy it's a little bit
easier to hold on to I have dropped it
once already so that's very much
appreciated so there you go that's the
black box carbon fiber body armor ipod
