video on Windows Home Server and I'm
gonna start going through the basics of
how to make home server work for you so
the first thing you're going to want to
configure on your home server is
computers and backups in this case I've
only got one computer hooked up to my
home server you can see right now it
says the status is not backed up yeah if
I could zoom in and focus I would be
terrific right about now okay well
anyway it says not backed up and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to
configure backup so welcome to the
backup configuration wizard I click Next
please wait while the wizard collects
information about this computer what
it's doing right now is it's finding out
how many hard drives are on my computer
how full it is and it's calculating how
much space it will take on the home
server etc etc choose the volumes that
you want to backup so I'm gonna back up
my system reserve volume as well as my C
local disk you can add folders to
exclude from the backup so by default it
does not backup recorded TV user
temporary files shadow volume
hibernation file a few key things that
does not backup the recycle bin folder
so if there's anything you want it to
not backup you can go ahead and add it
here so it's got a whole list of all of
the directories for example I don't need
it to backup the ATI folder you know
there's something I don't need it to
backup I don't need it to backup the
Nvidia folder so let's click Next
congratulations you have successfully
configured KPC to be backed up it was
that simple so now I could run it back
up now but the whole process will
probably take about 20 minutes and I'd
rather keep filming this video but you
can also okay can figure back hold on a
second the backup so yeah here's how you
view the backups so from here you cannot
you'll see a list of all the backups
that you've created you can change
settings for individual backups so you
can set them to either be managed
automatically which will be in your
master settings which I can show you in
a minute you can set it to keep this
backup forever or delete it the next
backup clean up now if you highlight one
of the backups and click details you can
actually browse the entire backup of
your hard drive from this Windows Home
Server console you can drag and drop
files on to your desktop and it is a
terrific way to get back you know
your mom's Word document that she
accidentally deleted because it will
keep it will keep it for as long as you
tell it to keep the backups so now we
have figured that out so why don't I go
and show you the backup settings and
then we'll call that a video so backup
time home computers are backed up during
the backup time that's fairly
self-explanatory so I'm gonna set mine
to run from 3 a.m. because I definitely
won't be awake at that time to 7 a.m.
I'm never up that early so that's when
it'll run all the backups here is the
automatic backup management so when you
say manage automatically these are the
rules that will follow so I like to keep
a good number of daily backups I don't
particularly care about the weekly
backups because I rarely go into those
and then I like to keep a good number of
monthly backups as well something about
the backups though is that it does not
use up the full like this computer has
100 gigs used on the drive
it doesn't use up 100 gigs every time
you backup it only reacts up the data
that has actually changed so storing a
bunch of backups of the same computer if
you're not completely formatting and
then refilling your hard drive with
completely different stuff actually
won't take up a ton of space there's
also a button here to repair the backup
database if it becomes corrupted this
can happen if a hard drive fails but
it's not a huge deal and then you can
also clean up the database now to get
rid of any backups but you don't want so
I'm gonna click OK and that is how to
configure backups on the Windows Home
Server it's really quite simple</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
