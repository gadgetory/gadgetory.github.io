whole lot here because I don't really
know how much they've changed about the
cooler I've only seen this in footage
from Nvidia's teaser so is it all
cosmetic or are there actual changes to
the design of the card I love the case
this is the kind of thing where you feel
like an idiot for for pulling it out but
the thing about collector's edition
computer hardware is that unless it ends
up being a very very iconic piece of
hardware like an original Mac I would
say in terms of bang for the buck you're
better off taking it out of the package
and enjoying it because it's not gonna
go up in value for not breaking the seal
I'm actually kind of liking this I
thought the the aged finish that they
put on it looked kind of tacky in the
video but in person that actually looks
not half bad like they've got a pretty
convincing effect on here I'm not quite
sure how they did this like it must be
it must be a paint application but it
looks really good what's this is this
the thing that you're supposed to
instructions not included got penis
stuck in the little port on the top no
it doesn't it doesn't look like that's
the thing you take off so the backplate
this is a funny thing
they actually printed the Star Wars logo
as though it's going to stay in the case
forever what a weird thing because the
text is gonna be upside down when you
install this in a case that is some that
is some classic you know video card
mistake stuff right there so the cooler
doesn't look fundamentally redesigned
they've got oh this is interesting
they've got this cover over the fan that
looks like it would make it hard to
install two of them side-by-side not
that I think too many people would order
like a bunch of these and put them in a
system but that heatsink looks pretty
similar
oh there's no DVI port on the back how
interesting alright so let's go ahead
and throw this
on to our Zenith extreme testbench here
oh come on
unplug the cord dang it
then we can have a look at the lighting
effects
okay time to fire it up yeah did not
think that one through with respect to
the positioning of our power cable here
is looking not too shabby so they've got
LED lighting all around the fan
they've got LED lighting under the grill
here oh look at the way you can actually
see the way they've wired it in so
they've just got a little a little tiny
like hard PCB LED strip going on there
and then they've just got it wired up
inside the heatsink so there it is
Unigine super position running on the
Titan XP collector's edition but wait
there's more ah yes so I don't have to
speculate that the Galactic Empire one
looks better I get to actually find out
in person oh this I'm excited about I
mean as excited as I can be about Nvidia
totally getting it wrong Jedi Order and
Galactic Empire are not I mean yeah
they're like good guys and bad guys but
they're like from different eras of the
Star Wars universe what is the deal with
that I don't know what it is and maybe
it's just the fact that it like doesn't
look so banged up gives it more sex
appeal maybe it's just that I actually
like in most cases I hate the glossy
black but man does that ever work here
with the glossy black on the Titan X
glossy black around the fan you've got
that I've always liked the dark nickel
coating on the fins on the vapor chamber
cooler like this card just looks so good
it I had actually thought from the video
that the heatsink designs were more
different but this one this one just is
better check this out this is a metal
piece on the Galactic Empire one check
this out check this out so this is metal
on here and it's just like a plastic
plug on the Jedi Order one alright let's
shut it down and let's do the
unthinkable nvidia sli on a high-end AMD
platform running Galactic Empire and
Jedi Order graphics cards could anything
be more wrong than this moment right now
the answer is no oh it's beautiful
it's like Christmas it's like my
Christmas because cuz it's because it's
black agree like Christmas also because
it's exciting also it's like
mid-november so it's clearly Christmas
if you go to a store updating LED
firmware so this one does an LED have
firmware I mean I guess you need
firmware if your LED looks like that
alright fine fair enough ASIS Boop now
let's get some SLI going here I got a
snap a picture of this for the Instagram
I shoulda known this was gonna happen
this this is what you can expect when
you put the light side in the dark side
together okay look at this it's like
it's like a half the horizontal
resolutions is broken okay let's let's
try this again why don't we try plugging
the HDMI cable into what is clearly the
dominant card which apparently is the
dock side all right I don't have to
stall for time anymore it's done
maximize 3d performance all right let's
try again and
now that's the TV that's not the
computer working that's a it's a TV
screen saver what you gotta be kidding
me well hi watch my light pardon okay be
clear I love my life but this is the
kind of crap that I deal with this is
supposed to be the simplest thing ever
plug in two graphics cards and be like
ah the Jedi Order and the Galactic
Empire they're working together I mean I
guess this is kind of funnier anyway
this is not the last time you've seen
these cards what I want actually is your
guys's suggestions for what you want to
see us do with them so leave those in
the comments and maybe you will see your
idea executed by being flung out of a
window
