it is now 5:30 I get off work at 6:00
and at that time I need to go directly
to an appointment for a portrait with an
acquaintance of mine who is not a
failure like me and is graduating from
university so I have to look decent now
I've been planning this tech tips for
point some time and if I could get the
cameraman to zoom right in on
particularly my chin you can see that
there's a lot of hobo-like stubble
growing on on the chin so what we're
going to be doing today is we will be
demonstrating the cybo
USB electric shaver available at your
local NCIX for less than $20 now due to
the time constraints of this video we
weren't able to charge it ahead of time
so if I could get the cameraman to check
out our ghetto setup here we are
actually plugged directly into a
computer to demonstrate the cyber USB
electric shaver now it comes with
absolutely no instructions so there is
potential for it to completely rip off
my face as I begin to use it now I just
want you to get this sound effect
because it's quite alarming yeah okay
there it is it's on so we are we are
ready to go it goes
okay you got that close up Wow it did
absolutely nothing okay let's try the
other way okay it's grinding away
all right well as you can see it does
operate without being plugged into the
computer we've had it in for about 20
minutes and functions just like a normal
electric razor would except that it does
charge via USB and if I could get the
cameraman to zoom right in it does not
remove much hair so thank you for
watching this Linus tech tips
presentation on getting ready at the
last minute with absolutely no supplies
whatsoever and if you have any
suggestions for future videos please do
leave comments under the video and we'll
have a look at them and if you don't
subscribe I cut to you good</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
