maybe you just suck at cooking maybe
you're like me I love cooking but I
rarely have time to sit around a nurse
some of the foods that I like to prepare
for myself to eat which can result in
more fast food junk food and paying for
late-night pizza deliveries in my
pajamas while waiting to respawn so how
do we solve this problem science of
course all we need is a little bit of
water cooling a 1100 watt heater a
brushless DC motor Bluetooth Wi-Fi and a
neodymium magnet
this is sous-vide cooking
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description so the general idea
behind sous-vide is that if you could
control your cooking temperature very
precisely and very accurately while
ensuring the heat is applied evenly to
the food all while keeping all the
juices herbs and spices contained well
that would be extremely beneficial if
you like tasty food so the way that
sous-vide cookers also known as
immersion circulators accomplish these
goals is pretty cool there's submergible
water circulators and heaters that keep
a volume of water within a reasonably
sized container like a cooking pot at an
exact predetermined temperature then the
idea is that you vacuum seal your food
or put it in a ziplock bag and squeeze
the air out this creates a barrier
between the water and your food while
still allowing for adequate heat
transfer what using one of these devices
and achieving all of the goals
previously noted affords you is a more
predictable and precise mathematically
enriched cooking experience traditional
cooking methods are heavily reliant on
timing because the heat used is usually
very high so pulling what you're cooking
away from the heat when it is at the
correct temperature to ensure that it
isn't under or overdone can be as much
of an art as a science with sous-vide
you just put your food in a bag tell the
cooker what you plan to eat and how done
you want it dunk your food in wait a set
amount of time or a little more if
you're busy and then just put a sear on
it to finish it up and enhance the color
texture and flavor what did you do award
today John
well I sear two chicken breasts in the
industrial heat gun so if you've made it
this far into the video and I know this
isn't usually our thing so thank you
you're probably interested but unsure
where to start there are a few solid
immersion circulators on the market
currently but the one I have today is
the Joule by chef steps a company backed
by the one and only gabe newell whose
son took an interest in cooking after
meeting chefsteps co-founders
hardware-wise the Joule is 11 inches
tall and only 1
eight five inches wide weighing in at
only one point two eight pounds it has
1,100 watts of heating power and can
maintain the temperature of up to 40 ish
litres of water enough to simultaneously
cook enough steaks for a small freaking
army it even has an impressive 0.1
degree Celsius temperature accuracy and
I've tested that it's true it does this
by combining its impressive heater with
a brushless DC motor and a 360-degree
Inlet flute at the bottom to pull in the
coolest water for reheating for
usability it features a neodymium magnet
mount with about 6 pounds of holding
force so it's not easy to accidentally
knock over when paired with iron steel
or other induction ready pots it's got a
simple clip on the back as well for
other containers like plastics and
whatnot and finally that brings us to
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi which again brings
us to the software the app is arguably
the best part and it features some
extremely important tools that chefsteps
absolutely nailed the first of which is
visual doneness
so as you follow their many interactive
guides that ensure you're correctly
compensating for meat type and thickness
you'll be presented with these awesome
videos not only do they provide funny
yet insightful comments about the
doneness of your food but they even
include a video of someone cutting into
said food after it has been cooked
letting you select a visual result for
your meal before you even start
brilliant this works because the lower
and more controlled cooking temperature
allows you to get every part of the meat
even the center of the thickest sections
to a minimum temperature that will
reflect that doneness without
overcooking anything else this is kind
of tricky with traditional cooking
methods that can leave thinner parts of
the meats or parts closer to the surface
overdone so at the end of the day it's
just math and chefsteps is doing it for
you
the temperature you want your meat to be
at when it's done corresponds to the
doneness that you choose at the start
then you pick the amount of time to cook
for based on the type and the thickness
of the meat in simple terms doneness
determines temperature type in thickness
determines time the app also features a
training wheel
off manual mode that lets you pick your
desired temperature and time if you want
to have some fun off the book there are
many odd things you can use the Joule to
cook and of course there's also
notifications although I do have a
pretty big gripe here it is truly a
notification not an alarm meaning that
when my phone is muted which it
essentially is always muted I don't hear
it it just vibrates now in their defense
this is a beta version and they could
easily change this with a software
update and with sous-vide it isn't as
important to get your food out of the
cooker right on time their app literally
tells you how long you have to remove it
which is often quite a while either way
I would prefer there was at least an
option to make this notification act
like an alarm so you're hyped up you're
ready to eat you're wondering what to
buy I was there on December 16th of 2015
i pre-ordered the Joule and as it goes
with much pre-ordered hardware and the
win show it was far from on time in fact
I don't even have it yet this is a beta
version that I got for review through
work not the one that I bought
personally I am very happy with how well
it works how easy it is to use and the
quality and feature list of the app and
holy crap the food is amazing my
girlfriend said the steak that I made
for it was the best she's ever had
my dad was super very much happy with
the steak he had and I cooked chicken
with it every other night and it's been
absolutely fantastic this is like you
went to a really nice respite but I am a
little salty pun intended again that
it's taking so damn long to get it into
my kitchen for good Dollar Shave Club as
you guys know they deliver great razors
directly to your door and if you sign up

you liked this video like it and get
subscribed and maybe go get some food
because you're probably hungry if you
just like this video and you're like
what the hell is happening to lies tech
tips I expected computer videos why did
you come here and it's crappy ok stuff
you can dislike the video and leave a
comment like that down below if you're
wondering where to buy a shirt check out
the link the video description down
below and buy some cooking stuff at
Amazon if you would like also check out
this video which is our tech quickie on
sous-vide cooking and I'll see you next
