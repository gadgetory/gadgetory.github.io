our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC

and our trusted networking partner is

hey guys were here the ASA suites at CES
we're just checking out some of the new
sound equipment we've got the Orion
headset as a retractable mic right here
one second I like that bendy retractable
all that good stuff really really really
good for bass I tested them in some
audio footage just for a was a die hard
trailer die hard 3 trailer and then i
texted some battlefield 3 footage as
well okay chase very hard so let's see
your cops I want to see how flesh there
hold on we get let me get focused nice
and closer there we go oh yeah I'm
focused on the right one there we go
how's the sizing really nice comfy
they're good they're good I didn't have
them on backwards but they're good
whatever you there yeah alright so for
for context for our viewers your
headphones of choice these days HD 595
okay how would they compare well these
are closed and they're really really
bass heavy and my HD 595 s are open and
they're more rounded oh it is quite a
different planet quite a different
experience okay and then what was that a
piece of audio equipment that you tested
it on over there well first we should
probably go over to spit fire which I
tested them on as well oh this is a USB
card that goes in between and there's
three different modes on here so you've
got amp surround and FPS fairly
straightforward is what they do this
gives you more power this enables
surround and this kind of enhances the
base alright moving on yeah and you're
Mike goes in there as well okay well
that's us beheading moving on we've got
the essence one use addition this I
can't really the exact stuff to chew and
over you see is powered by six top-notch
muses 0 1 op amps for crystal clear and
spacious sound so you can swap those out
as instead op amps which is really good
and it's now the first-ever oxygen free
copper integrated interconnected and
custom layout popping okay so that's all
they have is it sounds incredible the
warm deep tones and rig big rolling base
is really really good compared to the
original license one have you ever get
like a drum roll or a really deep deep
low boom it's really really warm really
really good we tested those with HD 600
I apologize for the incompetent filming
for this one that can be filming sup
have a closely this guy right here this
is really hard bezel beautiful so
they've made some tweaks in addition to
just changing the op-amps so it should
be over all an even better listening
experience and as an SS one user myself
anything better than in essence one is
pretty freaking awesome so thanks for
checking out Slick's first solo video
let's give them a round of applause
