anything more boring than network
switches I mean the box is boring the
products boring like they even look
boring look at them metal boxes but I
have something I'm legitimately excited
about today this is the first 10 gigabit
network switch designed for like
prosumer youth at a much more reasonable
price point 250 dollars compared to the
kind of money that we've spent on the
past on the 10 gigabits which is in our
server room but is this even the only
option this one from a soos or are you
better off picking up one of these
suckers off eBay well let's find out
shall we
Phoenix's Aria headphones come complete
with a cardioid mic and acoustic
chambers constructed of Japanese
Pinewood check it out at the link in the
video description okay so first things
first I'm going to have to clear some
space on my test bench here so the first
question I need to answer and I can do
this while we open this puppy up and
have a look at it is what is the points
of a faster network infrastructure in my
home does it make my internetting better
can i load Neopets faster and the answer
is no it's the only thing you use your
home network for is browsing the
Internet this will not make any lick of
difference whatsoever unless somehow you
have an internet connection that is
faster than one gigabit the speed of a
standard commodity network switch so
then the next obvious question that
people are always asking me is well if
it doesn't make your internet faster
what's the point and where does it even
go do I replace my wireless router with
it the answer is no you don't it
actually works in conjunction with your
existing router whether it's not to
market one or whether it's one that was
provided by your internet service
provider so what you do is your internet
goes in where it always did and instead
of plugging your computer into this bad
boy you plug this switch into your
original router / wireless access point
/ modem and all that good stuff so all
of this accomplishes two things first
and foremost it allows you to plug more
physical devices into your network then
would previously fit so you've gone from
this to now this lot better right but
that could have just as easily been
achieved with a cheapo $20 switch so
what's the XD you 2008 brings to the
table is it adds these to what I'm going
to call fast lanes these are 10 gigabit
ports so they run at
times the speed of standards gigabit
networking this is useful for a couple
of different use cases so number one
let's say you have a lot of people in a
house for an office you want to edit 4k
video or who want to watch uncompressed
blu-ray rips at the same time you plug
all those guys into all these other
ports here
boom boom boom boom boom and then you
plug a server machine with faster
networking onboard and fast forward into
one of the 10 gig ports now all of a
sudden these guys can all get their full
Network speed off of that same source
device pretty cool right
another potential scenario is let's say
that you've got a new gaming rig with
some ball and out SSD and you want to
get files off of I don't know a Steam
library or something elsewhere on your
network much faster well an SSD even a
SATA one can do somewhere in the
neighborhood of four to six times the
speed of standard gigabit networking so
by adding 10 gigabit all of a sudden you
can transfer 10 times faster to one
other machine on the network off of that
same server so let's do a practical
demonstration then here are my 10
gigabit ports right here this one is
leading to a fast storage machine over
in our server room over there and this
one is going to go into the 10 gigabit
networking ports that are built into the
x99 e10 GWS that i used for my desk pc
hopefully what I'm about to do doesn't
shut down the network and the rest of
the building but we will find out soon
enough
what oh crap ok one second my server
room needs some work I know
so here we go in a moment this should
pick up here and there we go ten gigabit
per second speed if you're not seeing
that by the way you might need to
upgrade your cables we're using cat6a
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what a 10 gigabyte file transfer might
look like on a 10 gig network very nice
wow you know what I think I was totally
wrong this does make Neopets better but
I promised a weird eBay alternative
didn't I yes I did and I'm delivering
this my friends both heavy is the quanta
computer lb 6m this is an entry-level
kind of enterprise grade 10 gigabit
network switch that seems to be being
phased out of some big data center
somewhere because these things are all
over a bay for around the same price 250
bucks you get two power supplies that
have a reassuring whine to them and you
get 24 10 gigabit ports along with for
regular gigabit ethernet ports a couple
management ports and a console port so
while you will have to deal with some
funny business for example you're going
to have to use these sfp+ direct attach
copper cables or like fiber optic
modules in order to connect everything
it needs to be quite expensive
anywhere from kind of 20 to even over
$100 a pop and you will need to have the
same matching hardware on the other side
for your network cards but again there's
more good news because these SFP+ cards
can sometimes we had for cheaper than
rj45 equivalents but if you're willing
to do some fooling around because there
are a lot of different firmwares out
there and you're willing to get all
command-line linux on it this baby looks
like it could be a pretty good value if
you want
or 10-gigabit and you're willing to give
up the convenience and the silence of a
desktop switch like that
Squarespace I don't know why they call
it Squarespace because you could build
your website any shape you want it could
even be a square or even a rectangle yes
my friend square a rectangle but what
all Squarespace sites have in common is
they look gorgeous and they work across
any device you could want and they make
it easy to build they offer live chat
and email support 24/7 it's inexpensive
starting at only 12 bucks a months and
every website comes with a ton of great
features including Commerce cover pages
which allows you to have a beautiful
one-page online presence in minutes
support for Apple news format so you can
have a Squarespace blog module and
access like millions of potential
readers and the best part is you don't
have to take my word for it you can
start a trial with no credit card
required and start building your website
