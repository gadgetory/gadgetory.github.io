gentlemen hey we recorded this week
because we have no idea what's going on
not a clue
we're having a tremendous afternoon
you're the craziest thing about today is
that we actually pressed go for the
first time on time oh yeah and I don't
remember the last time that happened
it's been a while and then after 35
minutes of trying to free streaming
services swapping Ethernet cables
changing encoding settings we just we we
can't we can't push anymore
notifications to YouTube because YouTube
won't deliver them to you and we just we
have no choice we have no choice there's
nothing that we can do oh my goodness
please tell me that this isn't live okay
I'm just yep cool I'm just gonna set
these unlisted and I'm just gonna call
them broken stream broken streams broken
dreams perfect all of the best title
best time 10 out of 10 10 out of 10
viral hit oh yeah this is the new cat
video yeah there's just there's nothing
I can do about this at this point we do
have for when you guys do so good oh
good the last one just went published in
public on the channel brilliant I love
it thank you thank you youtube
appreciate this don't know what's going
wrong it's great because the YouTube
diagnostic was Green
oh yeah it's like everything's flying
dream health was Green I don't worry
OBS all green and green yep ah no
problems here yep so great so we just
used up one two three I think for
YouTube notifications which I believe is
our daily limit so when show basically
won't get viewed this week because
algorithmic view serving rather than
just pinging people when we ask my face
cube although maybe they're saving us
from ourselves today because we just
know that might have been more times in
15 minutes yeah anyway we've got a great
show for you guys today a lot of good
stuff I've only got one your phone
yeah well hopefully should be restarted
no no I got this we already restarted
like four or five times the first big
topic of today is of course Apple
bailing reportedly on the butterfly
keyboard that they've been using in
their MacBook Pro so I know they're
finally so the original article here is
from Mac rumors dot-com we're gonna go
ahead and fire that up there you go
Apple to use new scissor switch keyboard
in future MacBook starting with the 2019
MacBook Air refresh wow that could
actually make the 2019 MacBook Air like
the notebook too by assuming that they
managed to put a quad-core processor in
at this time
yeah I've been pretty stoked on that
that goes against our notes in the dock
which is interesting because it said the
keyboard will likely not be ready for
this year's lineup and will be used in
the MacBook Pro but not until 2020
fascinating but they're rumors so either
way
sounds like hopefully Apple is moving
away from the butterfly keyboard yeah my
your mileage your mileage may vary on
these on these rumors of course yeah so
the the again the rumor is that the new
scissor switch can improve the typing
experience by offering a longer key
travel what what what nobody was asking
you know what you know what I really
wonder was Apple trying to pave the way
for a haptic screen switch
I could see it doesn't buy a lot of the
stuff they've been developing yeah they
kind of feel yeah like like kind of like
a sharp short almost like I like a
forced touch feel yeah and their force
touch is actually very good it's amazing
yeah or 3d touch or whatever whatever
yeah and those two is that even that
crazy like you look at the way the
Outernet
like the average person doesn't touch
type even
so if you're just Joe average and they
went and they put that they put the bar
in they went and they put these switches
that are sort of I mean they're in
between lots of travel and no travel
whatsoever am i boring you
I'm sorry no no no that's okay I know
you're just tired yeah anyway sorry
that's neither here no there so anyway
the new scissors which can improve
typing experience by offering a longer
key travel cheaper to make but won't be
as cheap as an average keyboard
apparently the butterfly does have the
advantage of being very thin which of
course nobody was really asking for yeah
I don't think that's been AI the whole
design industry has been so obsessed
with making phones and laptops thinner
and like it really doesn't matter past a
certain point they've been as thin as
I've needed them to be for a few years
now yeah like things were too clunky we
had there there's pictures you can find
of laptops that are like clearly too
thick but yeah I don't know at a certain
point it doesn't matter so much anymore
well you can fit it in a file folder
with like ease it's like ok yeah that's
probably good enough oh man a YouTube
chat is still going this is so simple
it's fair damn net why is this so hard
to understand they have a switcher
router down or their upstream is getting
hosed so while we were dropping frames
we measured what was it 600 megabit up
there's something stupid like that off
of the streaming computer so no yeah I
genuinely have no clue to millisecond
pings and 600 mega bit up while we were
still streaming so nope that's fine like
we're yeah usually usually like a
diagnostic process could just be do
everything over again and then it'll
maybe work and you won't necessarily
know what we are talking about maybe
work but we've done that like yep quite
a few time and we also don't have time
to do that right now when I was supposed
to be going live yeah right now so we
appreciate your suggestions but
unfortunately they weren't really
applicable this time no I kind of want
to just ditch this computer again
because I think it's haunted
that's the only possible explanation at
this point in time is that that computer
is haunted I made a joke last week I
think it was yeah which is where like I
should just bring my computer in every
Friday we just stream off of that but
like at this point but you could work
the crazy thing again like I like I was
I was afraid to
like I didn't want to blame it on the
network I could blame it on the network
cable that was running around yeah
that's because we're talking 20 meters
another 40 another 20 like you're
getting kind of close and we're going
through a switch although that
theoretically should reset the 100 meter
limit sort of issue I think anyway it's
not amazing it's not an amazing switch
and I was having an issue with an
Ethernet port in the set earlier this
week I was like okay maybe there's a bad
switch so we ran a cable directly to the
server room which is not into a bad
switch that's into like a $4,000 switch
a little bit of a sketchy cable it's not
a great cable but it looks like it's
working just fine yeah and we had the
exact same issue either way so I didn't
want to blame the network because the
stream card streams fine but that yeah
that's what I've been saying to this
computers and oppressed I've been
mentioning the stream card streaming
fine for a while now so but then the
direct connection that didn't fix it so
it's haunted it's it's haunted hardware
that's the only possible explanation for
it but it's been haunted for like six
years
speaking of haunted in other news this
week three Florida towns are apparently
infected by ransomware so this was
posted originally on Ars Technica
dot-com let's go ahead and pull the
article up here
Florida Len someone clicks link again
giving Key Biscayne miss Kanye I I don't
know
Key Biscayne ransomware triple FET
triple threat commodity malware attack
seizes computers of yet another Florida
town this is like ransomware is honestly
the smartest thing the blackhat
community ever came
with because compared to other attacks
it is so easy to deploy and is so
profitable like it is so lucrative I
mean compared to you know if you were
let's say hypothetically you were to
deploy something like a medium-sized
botnet okay in order to deploy that it's
relatively straightforward you have to
get someone to click on a compromised
link approve running a compromised
executable or some kind of script on a
web page or something like that
and basically for all intents and
purposes they are a part of your swarm
right sure does it go about like that
sure all right so then from there
monetizing the swarm is the next step
because just infecting people's
computers unless you just want to watch
the world burn doesn't have a nickel and
dimes benefit yeah so okay ways to
monetize a swarm you might mine
cryptocurrency on your swarm but you'll
probably have to do it in relatively low
amounts because you'd have to mind
fairly slowly because you don't want
people to reformat the computers or go
get them fixed or whatever or whatever
the case may be you sold so really the
key to a good infection is the user not
knowing that they are infected so mining
cryptocurrency in that so if you want to
bond it yeah you could you could
fraudulently you could fraudulently
click on a banner ads or you know
YouTube advertising or whatever else so
so you could you could conduct like a
click fraud operation you could from
keystrokes farm keystrokes okay yeah
right you could sell data all right so
you could find these individuals that
have so you could key log them so you
could find when they've logged into
something you could go okay let's let's
go try that and just kind of I'm sure
there's an AI that you could use to kind
of judge you just log like okay they're
on this page and they entered these two
things into these fields yeah sounds
good there you go so you can you could
start you could farm user data and then
from there you could commit identity
theft or there's a you know a variety of
other things you could just get straight
into people's bank accounts
fun's out of them so that can be pretty
lucrative but you've got at the point is
that once a computer is infected you
have to come up with something but yeah
also in that category you have to
transfer funds out of those bank
accounts to another bank account all in
like whatever I don't know what the term
for it is but like fiat currency a
currency yes so that's a little bit
tough because it's quite traceable
ransomware by contrast is just brilliant
because people to pay you directly you
only have to get theoretically as few as
one computer infected with it it's just
as easy to roll out as something like a
key logger if you basically if you can
get anyone to run an executable and
click through the prompts on their
computer I mean that that's it ok you
can talk all day Mac PC you know Chrome
Firefox it doesn't matter once you get
someone to execute a file and then blitz
through the security prompts on their
computer which most users will just do
without looking at them yeah they're
infected and an individual could pay
hundreds of dollars to unlock their
computer because at least with you know
one of those other types of infections
you can you can cut off the problem at
the source by just unplugging it from
the internet or formatting the PC or
whatever like it's something that can
relatively easily be fixed with
ransomware at least with the more
sophisticated ones you just don't have
your data and yeah you can reformat your
computer but say goodbye to all your
childhood photos or whatever else it is
that you store on your computer so an
average person would probably pay 2 300
bucks to give that stuff back well ok
not probably there's there's a very high
percentage chance that an average person
might be interested or there might be
things on that computer that are worth
two to three hundred bucks to them so
there it's a it's a decent amount to try
to charge a random but if you know that
you happen to get like a municipality or
a city or a bank or like some big entity
like that you can charge potentially way
more apparently first town
Palm Beach County yeah no idea $600,000
is to be paid and second 1-800 Lake City
Florida is also gonna be paying about 42
Bitcoin which is about four hundred and
sixty thousand USD whenever this was
written because that price changes all
the time before t2 Bitcoin the third
town Key Biscayne got no notice about
ransom most of their networks apparently
got backup within four days after being
infected but all of them were hit by the
same method a city employee clicking on
a malicious email yikes
that's pretty rough big eggs in other
news Vodafone UK's which is on 5g
service with unlimited data plan so the
original article here was from the BBC
let's go ahead and fire that up live in
five cities in the UK boom
switch is on in seven UK cities so in
spite of all the concerns that people
have about the safety of 5g not just
with respect to like the the the RF you
know like effects on their body or
whatever oh I was I was looking at my
wrist oh oh yeah sorry I thought I was
you've been exposed to 5 G's I know are
you ok I've got the 5 here I'm healthy
yeah I forgot so I was hydro dipping oh
I just know it's just paint on my arms
sorry I had a bit of a panic moment
there so anyway the concerns about 5g
are not just with respect to the effects
of the the waves on the human body just
sticking down weather satellites and not
crazy stuff so it apparently interferes
with weather forecasting or at least
could interfere with weather forecasts
no it's an exact Y anyways all right
well yeah but like I'm talking more than
just like 70% chance of rain or
yeah like hurricane warnings apparently
could be affected by this so it's a very
serious issue Luke and I think you
should just grow up the weatherman said
I would have more snow this year and I
didn't it's some upset it's weather
predictor weather correspondent not
weatherman oh okay
what year is it uh I think you need to
not just grow up but also get with the
times
oh my goodness I'm so sorry oh man okay
in other news did you see what's up
training in other in other news did you
see the dumbest thing on the Internet of
all time actually Nick I'll let you jump
in before I get into this having watched
your most recent video yet yeah yeah
I'll do it I'll do it during the sponsor
spots the best show okay it's the most
amazing show so this was trending on
Twitter last night and I don't usually
weigh in on political discussion on the
land show but oh boy this just made this
just it man it made me so mad
it could turn my hair red and that's a
joke anyway so there was a trending
hashtag today's hashtag not my Ariel
because a dark-skinned actress has been
cast to play Ariel in the live-action
Little Mermaid movie okay and I just
couldn't even I just couldn't even I see
where that's a joke now yeah so yeah so
basically white people were mad that
Ariel is not white
I don't yeah I don't get it really I
don't know why any one case so the
arguments getting made and this is this
is why I wanted to bring this out this
is this is the part of the show that's
just sort of off topic now so the
argument that was getting made was that
it's not true to the original like the
original content and that's kind of
where I was going with this it's just
it's a newsflash for everyone
racist or otherwise the Disney movie is
rarely if ever they usually based on
like fairy tales which came wave
Cinderella a lot older than nineteen
fifty years whatever you know the
Sleeping Beauty because there's like
there's interesting ones where you know
the Harry Potter and the and the what is
it cursed child or something yeah I
haven't read that Oh probably not bummer
I went to go see the play yeah was that
any good which was actually the
production was amazing how the play host
that it was in was fantastic
I think the the actors did a very good
job and like yeah the how they used the
production house and the effects and
everything were great etc but I was
actually a little confused and it first
started I didn't recognize Hermione
because she's not white right I didn't
get that once someone refers to her as
Hermione I'm like okay and I proceeded
to not care figured out the internet
cared a lot and but something that got
brought up is yeah apparently JK Rowling
yeah has said that she was never
intended to be white really and that she
was actually supposed to be African sure
of for whatever reason or equatorial
that continent descent I can't keep up I
don't know ones up right yeah and I read
that and went okay and moved on Internet
not okay with this and apparently in one
of the books it specifies that she is
white so when you told me the Ariel
thing that's why my reaction was
because now I'm wondering it's like
maybe in one of the fairy tales to the
doth it be your face happens to be a
pearlescent
I don't know I have no idea but like
maybe anyway the long and the short of
it is I'm never clicking on a trending
hashtag again cuz they never matter and
I'm sorry that I ever did because
Twitter is the ultimate illustration of
everything that is wrong with the
mainstream internet Twitter gives
everyone a voice and quite frankly not
everyone deserves one the thing that
just drives me nuts is like that's
actually the least important thing I've
heard of been so the skin colour of the
character who plays aerials yeah can we
address the bigger issue here that the
live-action remakes of the old Disney
classic cartoons are the most blatant
garbage grab yes of our time they are
worse than gaming movies I'm actually
gonna take that stance really defend it
okay have you seen have you seen hitman
no actually it's actually okay I get
really triggered about the Warcraft
movie because the amount of inaccuracies
in like why the heck is it live I think
the orcs the orcs were never intended to
be green they were right there's some
anyways the the Warcraft movie it drives
me nuts cuz Blizzard is insanely good at
making animated cinematics and yes they
always have been yeah then there's a
live action movie and everyone's like
what because they're you're thinking
this way to your strengths ladies and
gentlemen and they like change per the
story and all this guy stuff but if you
went in there never knowing anything but
Warcraft it's actually probably pretty
decent like there's something game I
think a lot of people are gonna take
issue with that in the comments but
please go on why I just think they will
I haven't seen the movie you told me not
to watch it so I know I wouldn't bother
exactly okay yeah but like I
I think gaming movies are at the very
least getting better and like hitman I
thought
was it was okay for a plain movie I
didn't feel like I wasted my time got it
okay so and I feel like every
live-action Disney movie is gonna be
good ways to test so here is I guess you
know what
i-i've challenged you to defend that but
I actually don't disagree with you
because to me I would what I'm glad you
brought up was whether it was a waste of
time or not yeah
so my that is exactly my issue with the
Disney live-action remakes
so I only watched part of Beauty and the
Beast not because I wasn't in the room
the whole time but because my attention
was super not focused on it because it
was very very boring so this is the
live-action version yeah at least with
most video game movies that I've seen
they at least try to put a spin on the
story and or the characters or just use
the original story and characters of the
game as a jumping-off point and do
something completely different long as
it's not made by I don't remember how to
say his first name but like I don't I
can't think of a video game movie that
tries to just steal the plot of one of
the games but just make it a movie
remember the old film fantasy movie that
was yeah it was nothing like no not even
close in the games but it's good fact I
would have made the argument that that
just shouldn't have been called Final
Fantasy anything because it was just
completely aft I would agree yeah but
it's good it's but it's still it's okay
but going back to the Disney live-action
movies they just they're it's just it's
in some cases even the same bloody songs
like they didn't even they didn't they
didn't they didn't do anything original
like okay it's it's it's really
expensive actors on it oh yeah cuz they
know they're gonna make a billion
dollars and they know the names of the
actors will help them make exactly lots
of money so so this is a it's it's and
that's my problem with it is like I feel
like my time is being wasted because I'm
being told the exact same story in the
exact same way with the exact same songs
and I'm somehow supposed to get over the
fact that Hermione Granger is Belle for
whatever and French I guess and I just
can't
III just I don't get it and so to me it
just looks like it's entirely a
bean-counter decision yeah someone went
okay we can do a remastering of The Lion
King
now on blu-ray in 3d with some some DVD
extras and behind the scenes and we can
do a big campaign we can do a theatrical
release and we can print ourselves 150
million dollars later interviews or we
can do this we can spend twice as much
we can spend 300 million dollars but we
know we're gonna get 900 million one and
a half billion like we know what the
return is because we can just take it
almost as a straight-up formula we just
go okay here's the year of the original
release here's what it grossed here's
what the overall like because I'm sure
they have figures for all this here's
what the overall merchandising numbers
were like so here's how many adult
humans today with children exist that
loved this movie yeah and they can just
draw a freaking trend line through it
and go okay so that one's worth about
1.15 billion if we put the Disney
machine to work and pump out all this
stuff around it that's gonna cost us
about 350 million so we could either
spend you know 5 million redoing the
same movie or 10 million or whatever
you're adding 3d and get our 150 million
or we could take a bigger risk but it's
not a risk no and we could generate a
much bigger return let's work on that
instead so that's why we saw one of
these things and now there's an
extension oh yeah it worked for sure
just do it again and I was never that
into Beauty and the Beast so it didn't
offend me even if I didn't particularly
enjoy the live-action thing like I was
just bored because it was like this is
the same movie yeah but now instead of
the because I love animated movies
that's gonna say some things are better
and some things are better animated some
things lend themselves like Warcraft
imagination better when they're animated
How to Train Your Dragon wouldn't be as
good a film if it wasn't animated no
neither would
incredibles no and no and so I just I I
wasn't like offended but I actually just
found out apparently they're working on
live-action Mulan and that kind of
annoyed me because and we had we had a
big debate in the office today about
which is a better which is a better
Disney film Mulan or Hercules do you
want to weigh in on that
did you ever see either of them okay
it's been a wild amount of time since
I've seen either and an exceptionally
wild amount of time since I've seen move
on but probably move on I mean there's
no right answer I mean no one would
agree with you if you said Hercules
other than David okay yeah
but like I only just found out they're
doing a live-action one of that and I'm
just like what are you gonna like what
were you aiming to fix and if you
weren't aiming to fix anything
movie it's like 1996 or 98 or something
I guess that was a while ago it's pretty
old it's like over 20 years old oh man
98 yeah it's 21 years ago darn it
alright so sorry when you guys actually
watch this live we haven't had a live
chat to keep us on track yeah sorry guys
well get back on track with our sponsors
the show today is brought to you by

you need go check it out it's PIAA it's
freaking awesome it's sweet
speaking of Awesome Corsairs hydro x is
bringing full-custom liquid cooling to
the masses corsair their XC 7nx seen
RGB CPU blocks are among the top
performers out there with their skiff
skeeved skived with their skived micro
fin cold plates and really the main
story here to me is the way that courser
handles an entire ecosystem of products
so they're all designed to work together
properly and they went all out so some
of the products were designed by corsair
in-house including the cpu blocks as
well as the reservoir pump arrangement
although you'll be happy to hear this
they didn't go stupid on the pump they
went with a genuine laying d5 cool okay
right that's actually very nice and like
they had the stones to just go with what
people should buy instead of offering
things that people shouldn't buy because
they might want them I will say as
someone who has had no involvement in
this whatsoever the fact that they just
went with a d5 makes me very happy yeah
really good for the radiators they had
Hardware labs do them up cool for the
fittings who do you think just guessed
they it was a good choice it was a good
choice it was got two in mind one of
them has bits power when with bids power
fittings so they designed things
themselves where it made sense GPU
blocks as well and they went with
partnerships where they felt like there
was outside expertise that could help
them deliver a better product so go
check it out it all works together great
and you can use their configurator over
at LMG GG slash hydro x and it'll help
you pick all the right stuff and put it
all together

orders of $30 or more so go check that
out right away it is limited in quantity
and time um alright so what else do we
have for the show today that's actually
a nuts deal we've got a little bit off
topic there just a little bit how do we
get there talking about keyboard
switches I don't know I think I got
super mad because like honestly it
consumed a lot of my time because I just
it was one of those things where I
couldn't look away from the stupid house
just oh right the the Twitter topic yeah
I was like just scrolling my phone like
a zombie until I finally but I think I
think that's the whole oh man we got a
knock it caught on this even longer but
I think that's the whole problem with
those types of issues and why they start
trending because you're like oh goodness
and then people weigh in after feelings
right instead of just scrolling forever
like you did the way in and then scroll
forever and then reply to them and then
over planned this whole thing that
should have never mattered at all yes
now trending on Twitter it's now
trending on Twitter yes madness
fantastic
speaking of madness Trump is apparently
treated some restrictions on huawei the
original article here is from Engadget
coms go ahead and pull that up he
verbally stated that US companies can
sell their equipment to huawei during a
g20 summit in Japan not clear which
companies are allowed to do business in
Huawei not clear exactly what Hardware
either because he said they can sell
hardware that doesn't have a great
national emergency problem
and they're still on the Commerce
Department's entities list which is like
a big issue if you want to sell anything
to them but he's verbally said that you
can so I don't think anyone knows what
this really means Huawei has apparently
scaled back film production since the
ban was announced - due to the loss of
official Android support and other
partnerships and as much as I'd love to
say that this means everyone can go back
to business as usual
that is often not the case when it comes
to random off-the-cuff statements yeah
from this particular leader of the free
world so we just thought we'd say hey
something was said might happen it might
mean something don't know stuff in
videos super graphics cards are out and
the word on the street this is according
to video cards calm is that in response
to in videos super launch of the RT X
2060 super RT X 2070 super and RT X 2080
super AMD is going to lower pricing of
their Radeon rx 5700 series ahead of the
launch so they had already announced
pricing if I recall correctly yes they
did for their new Navi series and I
don't believe they have announced what
the new pricing will be so right now
it's a bit of a mystery and they're
really they're really cutting it close
to the wire here aren't they because the
launch is in two days and incidentally
that two days time frame happens to land
us on a Sunday which means that all of
their partners like you know stores
where people might buy these graphics
cards might not have their business
administration staff in the office and I
guess this opens up to a pretty certain
not a rant but into
a grievance that I guess this is an
opportunity for me to air
AMD needs to stop launching their
products on weekends today we received
not what yeah you know what I don't I
don't know I mean everyone knows what's
launching and when it's launching today
we received not one but two last-minute
updates that affect both of the launches
and for that reason we have multiple
people on staff here that are being
forced to come in on the weekend in
order to get our videos done on time
it's not right it's not fair and it's
completely unnecessary there's a reason
why a huge amount of industries release
things on Tuesdays you dodged holidays
in a huge amount of countries that you
might not have planned for on purpose
because they one country might have a
Monday off for whatever reasons no
you're fine in terms of long weekends
and you have a big part of the week
ahead of you to fix things within
standard hours for the whole industry
whether it's the person selling your
product to end-users well they're it's
your side offering support etc etc you
have the meat of the week ahead of you
and you don't have problems of long
weekends so instead AMD and their board
partners have probably been scrambling
last minute to get you know something
with POS rebates or other kinds of
support issued to their their reseller
partners in order to make sure that
their pricing is competitive and so yeah
it's just it's one of those things that
I wouldn't even mind if it wasn't so
unnecessary and II could have easily
launched this on a different day of the
week a few days was not going to affect
the overall impact of of this launch you
know if they're advertised performance
claims are anything to go by it's just
rude I just don't get the point
benefit is there and the thing too is
like AMD might have thought well we're
gonna be ready well enough ahead of time
that it's not going to be a problem but
they should really just know themselves
a little better at this point this is
the second time they've dropped a driver
update on us on a Friday before a
weekend
in three launches so like guys know your
own limitations
you are never ready on time so with that
in mind plan to not be ready on time and
to be sending out last-minute stupid
emails about everything that's changed
the night before and so that there's
some kind of a contingency for all the
people that are reliant on you keeping
to your word and keeping to your
schedule or at the very least not
keeping to your word and not keeping to
your schedule but at least having some
kind of plan so it's really really
frustrating
speaking of which apparently the
re-recordings that I need to do for one
of those videos is ready so I might just
have to I might just have to cut this
win show a little bit short so I can get
that get that done here so there
anything else that you had really wanted
to talk about today the Amazon thing is
not that interesting we can we can run
through it real quick and you do it
really fast sure there's a question
should Amazon be held liable for
third-party seller of products the US
appeals court ruled that Amazon can be
held accountable for faulty third-party
sales
third-party sellers selling either
defective or dangerous products items
includes items not directly sold or
fulfilled by Amazon there's a lot of
sellers on Amazon I actually kind of
wish there wasn't or I wish it was a
little bit more obvious not that
apparent that you're buying from some
random yeah yeah they do they do
communicate it yeah but it's not kind of
blasted to you yeah and it's really
annoying when it happens because a big
part of the reason why at least I shop
on Amazon is because I know I'm dealing
with Amazon yeah and I'm actually not
that interested in shopping on Amazon to
deal with other groups if I wanted to
shop on some random website with
products that might be sketchy or crappy
I would go to a website that specializes
in products that you know might not have
been imported correctly or might not
adhere to the same safety standards yet
you know someone like Amazon would have
to make sure that they are so apparently
nearly half the items sold on Amazon are
through third-party sellers I actually
had no I had no clue either that's kind
of wild I wonder if that means half the
listings yeah I have no idea not the
actual volume I bet you it's listings
not volume yeah cuz the volume would
have to be in order for it to be half of
the items like half of the packages sent
like the vast majority of listings would
have to be non Amazon listings because
I'm sure Amazon watches for anything
with high volume stocks yeah yeah and so
basic now we have our own version haha
and there's our basics did but I was
gonna say one day
there's been no comment by Amazon yet so
the the origin of the case was
apparently a gal by the name of Heather
a Bergdorf who sued the company in
federal court back in 2016 when a
retractable dog leash snapped and
whipped back at her causing permanent
loss of vision in her left eye whoa so
the lower court will rule on whether the
lease itself was defective but that's
where this whole debate seems to have
come from right so that's it for the
land show this week oh we do have a blog
post from you guys over at LTX expo site
