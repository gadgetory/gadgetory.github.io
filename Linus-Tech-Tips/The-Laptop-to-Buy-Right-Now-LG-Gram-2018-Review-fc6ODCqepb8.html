there's always this up to bullcrap next
to the advertised battery life on the
product page
what does up to even mean well from our
experience it means a lot less than this
fantasy number right here and while
there are laptops out there with great
battery life the problem is most of them
are MacBooks so if you want one you're
gonna need to grab your wallet and go to
the bank to apply for a small loan at
least that used to be the case meet the
LG gram 2018 be reasonably affordable
ultra portable laptop with the best
battery life we've ever seen
fortnight Battle Royale is the free 100
player PvP mode in fortnight it features
a giant map destructible environments
and more check it out at the link below
and stay tuned for more information
later in the video if we're being honest
the gram isn't the most beautiful device
on the market in no particular order
here are three sexier laptops but it's
not butt ugly either the magnesium
chassis makes the gram rigid while
helping it maintain its surprising
lightness and it's simple clean design
is complemented by its thin bezels IO
lies the ground beats out basically
every other super portable with a
full-sized HDMI a couple USB Taipei's
and finally Thunderbolt at least on
certain configurations of the 15 inch
model so that last one is only a half
victory but it's still a step in the
right direction and the internals don't
disappoint either with 4 cores on both
the core i5 and core i7 models
it'll chew through productivity tasks
like Chrome office and even light video
and photo editing like you wouldn't
believe like frankly these 8th gen Intel
chips have been such a game-changer
infinite lights that it has become very
hard to recommend any products that
haven't been updated yet like the
surface laptop as of right now and the
Grand manage is more than just short
bursty performance to avoiding thermal
throttling even during our extended
stress tests I mean we're not saying you
should complete your engineering degree
on it but if you've got a configuration
with Thunderbolt 3 it'll actually turbo
up nicely in games for a pretty solid
experience provided you're willing to
invest in an external GPU with that said
if you're looking to game the LG grim
won't be your first option a lot more
power can be had by adding a little bit
of back strain the grab is at its best
when it's used for on-the-go
productivity the trackpad is fine so
that's good and the keyboard has a quick
tactile travel that is kind of
Kian actually pretty satisfying it's not
the best we've seen on a laptop the
surface laptop is currently the leader
in this category but the 13-inch model
especially is in the same ballpark
thanks to its stiffer chassis so at the
end of the day it really comes down to
how much and alc√°ntara
wrist rest is really worth to you and I
guess the screen is another factor on
paper a 1920 by 1080 touchscreen feels
pretty 2015 falling well behind the
pixel density of competing models but
hold on a minute at 13 inches 1080p is
the same pixel density that would get
sold to us super-high resolution for
Kane 9000 on a 27 inch desktop monitor
is it not so do we really sit that much
closer to our laptops I'm actually with
LG on this one I can't complain about
the gram 20:18 screen its IPS panel
looks great with deep blacks and just
enough brightness to make outside use
possible and the new webcam placement
means that my only criticism of it is
the kind of soft picture rather than the
kind of soft picture and the view of my
nose hairs like like right up there on
the old one the last unfortunate
disadvantage of the Graham is its lack
of Windows hello facial recognition
however the new fingerprint reader
location inside the power button makes
unlocking much quicker than typing in a
password it's actually really natural to
use now then we're done with the
underwhelming stuff so let's talk really
good stuff starting with the battery
life thanks to its 72 watt hour battery
which is more than most gaming laptops
the 13-inch grande was able to beat
every other laptop we have ever tested
in our work battery life benchmarking
like it's still not 21 hours but you
could actually put it a full day of real
work on it and still have battery life
left over to watch a movie on the bus on
the way home and this freedom to be
completely untethered from wall outlets
is going to be
huge for many people from the student
that can now get a good seat in the
library to the journalist that can be
all location all day without worrying
now the 15 inch model still has
above-average battery life just over
seven and a half hours it's just not as
impressive as the 13 also somehow LG
managed to do all of this while
maintaining easy upgrade ability of the
RAM and the storage leading us to the
most compelling aspect of the Graham its
price when compared with the you know
$4.99 special at the local Best Buy yeah
starting at eleven to twelve hundred
dollars depending whether you want a
touchscreen is a lot but compared to
other premium thin and lights it's great
bang for the buck so in summary it might
not be the prettiest the most powerful
or the highest resolution laptop out
there but it's lightweight the keyboard
rocks and it's got killer battery life
if I was shelling out my hard-earned
cash for an ultrabook today the gram
would be getting those dollars fortnight
Battle Royale is now free to play on PC
Mac PlayStation 4 and Xbox one it's a
100 player PvP game mode where you drop
in loot fight and hopefully end up being
the last one standing to win it features
fully destructible environments and
buildable structures and you can
currently play by yourself or with your
friends in duo's or squads best of all
did I mention that it is free because
it's free check it out now at the link
