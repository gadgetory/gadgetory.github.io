from Coolermaster is now available in a
variety of cool colors from these great
retailers click now to learn more
the original grid from NZXT alleviated
cable management and fan power headaches
by allowing users to plug all of their
fans into a single molex connector the
issue with it is that it only splits
12-volt power rather than allowing the
fans to actually be controlled so the
only way to run at anything other than
full speed is to figure out a high
quality inline fan controller solution
or rewire the connector to 7 volts or 5
volts so that's where the grid plus
comes in it costs double or triple
depending on the retailer you shop at
for the same 30 watt power limit but it
adds DC fan control to the capability of
the original grid through NZXT T's cam
software which is available for your PC
or smartphone although why you'd ever
need to control your fan speed from an
iPhone is far beyond the capabilities of
my very obviously too small brain to
cover in any way physically it's a fan
controller so there's not a lot to say
it's got a white top power LED 6 side
mounted 3 pin fan headers and a slight
plastic overhang so you don't have to
stare at the wires even though the
included ones are thankfully all-black
it's got a USB input and a power jack
and included in the box you'll get a
micro USB to internal header as well as
a molex to power cable for the ports
that I just mentioned you'll also get
five zip ties a 3m dual lock square for
stealthy mounting and two fan extension
/why cables that allow a four pin and a
three pin fan to be connected to a
single power port at the same time which
demonstrates NZXT is aware that some
folks plug four pin PWM fans into three
pin sources and use DC control on them
which raises the question NZXT why
didn't you address my original complaint
about the grid and make them all four
pin this time anyway and not stalling
for time here let's cut to Luke to tell
you guys exactly how it works so setting
up the unit is fairly simple you plug in
the USB cable you plug in the molex
power you plug in all your face
ends but then you need the software so I
went to end EDX tees website and clicked
on the Downloads button under the grid
plusses product page and it brought me
to a download section of wallpapers not
cam software what anyways you can go to
the cam section of their webpage and
download it there because it works for
all of your devices I guess they didn't
decide to have it under the download
section of individual devices but I
would like to maybe see that in the
future next up is fan curves they have a
few default ones like performance or
silent and they also have manual where
you can kind of just set everything to a
very specific speed that it will always
run at or like I expect most of you to
use they have a custom curve and setting
up the custom curve is actually pretty
nice whenever you plot a point along the
graph and you try to move it it's very
clear as to what you're moving it to you
know exactly what percentage is you're
running at and that's nice because I've
seen with fan software in the past
you're kind of guessing like I think
that lines up with whatever percentage
that might be and you're not really sure
so it's absolutely nice how clear it is
that being said it goes in increments of
5% so if you're trying to be extremely
specific about something the smallest
number you can get down to is an
increment of 5 another thing to note
about the fan curves is that the ramping
is not smooth so it will jump from point
to point so if you're setting up a
custom curve and you want your fans to
slowly increase in speed you're going to
want to set a lot of points along the
graph so it has a lot of bumps like a
lot of different increments that it's
going to go up as it speeds up instead
of having one point and another point
which is much higher because it won't
change until the temperature hits to
that much higher point and then it will
change the entire way up it will not
smoothly change to that speed just
something to note if you're setting it
up on your own
another thing that caught my eye was a
switch where you can change whether or
not you're monitoring your CPU
temperature or your GPU temperature I
thought when I first saw this due to it
being a fan controller that the custom
graph or whatever speed ramping graph
you have for your fans would reflect the
temperature that you're currently
monitoring so CPU or GPU so you can
position your fans differently around
the case that is not the case at which
point I don't really understand why it's
a switch and why they didn't just have
both of the
being monitored at all points in time
the fan info on the right side of the
software is very clean and very easy to
read I liked that a lot you can see all
of your fans at all points in time you
can see what voltage they're running at
what speed they're running at it's it's
nice I would actually really like to
have this on my radiator testing station
so I can make sure all my fans are
running properly all the time I do that
anyways but it's just slightly more of a
laborious process
I personally am waiting to see something
as feature-rich as a t balancer but then
as aesthetically awesome as the cam
software that's running on these because
T balancers software is not awesome at
all speaking of whatever it is Luke was
just talking about I have no idea I
scripted this before he did his thing so
uh Intel is going to be at nerd HQ which
