gets featured on the when show bill
blogs the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it to start with I want to be very clear
about how I'm approaching all of this
I've got lots of nice headphones and I
had some clip chefs force for a while so
those weren't bad my daily driver im's
for the last few months have been
SteelSeries fluxing or pros due to their
excellent comfort but i've never owned
pricey audiophile grade earphones before
so this is as much a first impressions
of expensive.i ems as it is a review of
the IE ats from sennheiser so we'll
start with initial impressions the
packaging feels very premium and comes
with an unbelievable number of your tips
to choose from which is good because the
dynamic drivers with their fancy
neodymium magnets are very large and I
actually needed the smallest possible
silicon tips in order to get these
babies into my ears comfortably the
carrying case that's included is super
nice and totally irrelevant for the vast
majority of people who buy I EMS I think
there's good news though the IE ATS have
other than the scratches that you'll see
in our macro footage of them survived
very well in my pocket with my phone and
they're extremely easy to untangle the
removable kevlar reinforced cables are
quite stiff out of the box which was a
concern because the IE 80s actually wrap
around the top of your ear before being
inserted and while the cable was brand
new I found that the wire would often
slip off of my ears like this
Sennheiser does include a little cable
routing sheath in case you want to use
it but I actually found it more
comfortable to wear them without it and
in a week or two I didn't have that
problem anymore anyway as far as looks
and comfort are concerned that your
phones look kind of heavy and bulky but
they're actually so comfortable and
low-profile that I'm able to sleep in
them without them falling out during the
night this combined with their solid
noise isolation has made them a definite
keeper for me they have a very subdued
style to them with an all black and
silver color scheme that I quite like
but while it might feel silly and
superfluous and I
catching design might help them get
attention from mainstream customers the
way that brands like beets and
Skullcandy do sadly through an informal
poll of a couple of my less techy
friends I found that they had never even
heard of Sennheiser which depressed me a
great deal moving on to the reason it
might depress me that someone's never
heard of Sennheiser is the listening
tests in my listening tests I used a
variety of different sources including
an o2 and Oh doc from Mayflower
electronics and a zonar essence one from
Asus and other than this being the first
time that I've been able to hear the
noise floor of my essence one as a hiss
during the quiet part of certain tracks
I really felt like a strength of this
product is the fact that they sound
great with pretty much anything from
cheapo mp3s on my iPhone 4 all the way
up to flax on my objective to an ode ACK
before we go any further here though I'm
is my usual disclaimer and apology about
the kind of music I listen to on the top
40 listener just like lots of people I
love Bieber and Miley and pink and well
not beaver so much but you know JT is
definitely better but the point is if
you want reviews of these from folks who
listen to classical music
those are abundant this is my review and
that's the kind of music I listen to so
there you go
truthfully having requested the ie 80s
on the recommendation of Ed's almighty I
didn't really know what I was getting
myself into
I saw the adjustable base port feature
on them and I went oh how quaint if
folks want more bass they can turn that
adorable little dial with the included
tool well there's nothing adorable or
quaint about it whatsoever with or
without the knob the bass experience
with these is truly skull rocking it
really feels like the bones at the back
of my head are vibrating when I really
let them loose and it's an experience
unlike any that I've had before
highs are both loud and clear and mids
are also clear if a fair bit quieter and
more subdued
this made mid-range vocalists feel a bit
far away especially during busier parts
of a track with a lot of background
music after some discussion with Ed's I
found that his love for the ie8 which
are very similar to the IE 80s comes
from finding it easier to take a clear
detailed I am with very strong bass
performance and tame it somewhat with
software equalization than it is to take
a reference sounding IEM and try to
boost the bass on naturally 3q it's a
great point but I found myself quite
liking their bass heavy sound signature
after a while and three weeks later I am
no longer using EQ on them at all they
sound great loud and this is unusual for
me but with these I often find myself
not reaching for the volume dial nearly
as much as I did even though that they
do sound great loud the isolation is
good without me feeling like I could
probably get hit by a train without
hearing it coming and in spite of the
strong bass performance I can hear every
last detail in the music without
cranking them so I have the option to
listen to them quietly or turn them
right up and kill the skull vibration
one way the IAT surprised me a little
was their openness once while I was
sitting in my house listening to them I
actually had one of my baby songs come
come on it has a car horn in it and I
actually looked outside thinking it was
in my driveway before I realized it was
part of the track this is unusual and
many IEMs really make you feel like the
sound is coming from between your ears
but not so with these my wife had a very
similar experience with them she's no
audio file and I think the word she was
looking for was soundstage but her way
of describing it was this instead of
hearing the sound from here and here
it's like it's here here here here here
and here and I thought that was kind of
cool coming from someone who doesn't
know all the terminology but is
definitely still having the same
experience so we're down to the part of
the video where I say whether I'd
recommend them or not well they're over
$300 on Amazon so if you're going to buy
them you'd better be sure you won't lose
them and once you get past that hurdle I
would say if you want something that
delivers a strong bass heavy sound
signature like many mainstream products
but actually does it well with tight
thumping low frequency performance and
clarity in the mids and highs then get
on board these are for you the
discerning bass head
I think the IE 80s can be best described
for you as fun to listen to and you're
going to absolutely love them if you're
looking for reference IEMs for studio
monitoring and you want a flat frequency
response curve then I think you'd better
move along there are products out there
that are designed for you this is not
one of them my personal closing thought
on the IE 80s is this they're expensive
but at the end of the day I've got a
literal pile if you guys are following
me on Instagram you'll know about this
already I've got a literal pile of
audiophile grade headphones next to my
PC and most days when I'm sitting down
and it's time to listen to some music
I still take these out of my pocket and
plug them in instead I haven't done
these yet but I probably should mention
a couple of popular upgrades there's a
version of the detachable cable with a
mic that you can buy so that's kind of
cool and in spite of the wide variety of
included ear tips the ones that I
actually liked best are third-party
comply soft foam ear tips they improve
the isolation even further if that's
what you're after and they're also very
very comfortable and I think that's
pretty much it
oh wait note I've got something else
that's fun for y'all we're going to be
giving away in Asus Transformer book
t100 in a special livestream on the 12th
of December 2013 with a special theme I
want you guys to click the annotation or
on the link in the video description and
post your best holiday gift ideas for
geeks and techies for us to discuss on
the stream it's sponsored by Seuss so
definite bonus points if you can come up
with coolie Seuss gift ideas and there
now we're done as always guys liked this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it and in the comments I'd also
like to do a bit of an informal poll
what was the most you ever spent on a
pair of earphones or headphones and at
what point did you feel like it stopped
being worth it to spend more where you
got to the point where ok I spent twice
as much but this only really sounds 10
percent better than the other one to me
I'm really curious and I'd love to hear
what you guys say as always don't forget
