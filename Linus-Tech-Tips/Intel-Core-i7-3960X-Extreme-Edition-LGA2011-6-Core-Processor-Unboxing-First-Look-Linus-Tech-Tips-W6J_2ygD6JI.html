i7 39 60 X LGA 2011 extreme edition
desktop processor what you may or may
not have noticed at this point in time
is that this processor does not include
a heatsink so like some previous
processors in the past although it's
never been done by Intel this CPU
assumes from the get-go that you are
going to be using aftermarket cooling
however Intel does have cooling options
available they actually have two
different cooling options available that
you can buy separately and that is an
air cooling heatsink which you can buy
okay there you go
you're pretty that this pretty much what
used to come included with the extreme
editions and then you can also buy their
water cooler which we used in a previous
video and is installed in the case right
now it's going to be kind of hard for me
to drag it out so what do we find inside
the actual box I have even less of an
excuse for doing an unboxing of a
processor at this point now that there's
only a CPU a sticker and a installation
instructions on three-year warranty
booklet inside huh look at that sealed
with a sticker there we are right oh
there so it shows you how to install
stuff and tells you about how you have a
three year warranty tell you about Intel
hyper-threading technology and
virtualization technology and this has
pretty much all of the Intel technology
because this is the extreme edition this
is the cream of the crop and it is
expensive so an LGA 2011 CPU is very
large it has two thousand zero hundred
and eleven pins on the bottom of it and
I'm just going to show you guys for
scale what it looks like next to a
couple of other CPUs when I get back
with said CPUs from the tech tips room
while slick takes a very close look at
really the booklet you've got to be
kidding me okay oh he says he was
looking at the CPU all right fine
okay so this is an LGA 1155 CPU then
is an LGA 1366 CPU and therefore scale
next to them is your LGA 2011 CPU so
basically it is a beast and here from
AMD is their am3+ socket so you can kind
of see how that compares as well so it's
by far the biggest desktop CPU out there
in terms of share size which obviously
equates to performance
well doesn't but in this case it does so
this is a 3.3 gigahertz CPU which is
capable of turbo Inge up to 3.9
gigahertz so yes turbo boost
technology is on this particular chip
it's a six core CPU with hyper-threading
which means 12 threads just like the
previous generation 990 X on LGA 1366 in
fact I believe this is a 990 X there you
go this is a 990 X so this is how much
bigger and this is how much better it
performs then a 990 X this is based on
Sandy Bridge technology it's called
sandy bridge-e SPE and what that means
is it's basically six of these cores
instead of four of these cores with
4-way quad channel memory support PCI
Express 3.0 support up to 16 X by
sixteen X 4 to a graphics configurations
are 16 8 8 4 3-way and 8 8 8 8 4 4 Way
SLI or crossfire X configurations and it
has 15 Meg's of cash
compared to the non Extreme Edition CPU
which has only 12 Meg's of cash and is
clocked lower I think that pretty much
covers everything that is to say in this
CPU unboxing so if you want the mostest
performances and the largest CPU on the
Block then this is the one to get</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
