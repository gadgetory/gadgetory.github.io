certified concept featuring the MSI
BIGBANG z77 mPower now I'm going to
quickly explain the difference between
what we've seen in the past and what we
are seeing now because they are
incredibly different in the past we've
seen military class components
high-quality components that are
optimized for overclocking optimized for
performance all of that good stuff we've
seen digital power phases and you know
the olden capacitors and all kinds of
crazy stuff in the past before if we're
not only MSI but everyone but OSI
certified takes all that theoretically
this stuff should be good and steps it
up to a whole new level every single
board gets hand tested at an overclocked
setting in a non-ideal environment with
prime95
that's right a true enthusiast stability
testing program and we're gonna be
having a look at this board in a real
system in a real case with the real
graphics card running real games to see
what kind of a benefit we get from the
EZ overclocking experience that an OC
certified board enables and comparing it
to a non overclocked system to see what
we can do with basically what amounted
to about 15 minutes of overclocking and
yeah it was amazingly easy now we're
gonna start with a bit of a product tour
here guys so the z77 mPower is sort of a
step up from the z77 AGD 65 they
actually bear some similarity to each
other in terms of the overall layouts of
these boards the PCB designs and I
apologize I'm gonna have to cheat a
little bit we're going to use a picture
of the z77 mPower and a real board for
the GD 65 because the M power is in that
system over there so the PCI Express
slot layout is exactly the same however
on the M power you see some significant
improvements so number one is that it
does include wireless connectivity while
both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth it also has a
beefier 12 phase hybrid there it is
hybrid digital power design which the GD
65 does not is using only an eight
phase-- design so the digital hybrid
power design allows higher power
efficiency faster power transmissions
programmable has a programmable
microprocessor inside and is optimized
for extreme overclocking okay it has
better cooling significantly better
cooling but it does have better cooling
it's got a super pipe whereas the DD 65
did not it has I think a way better
color scheme especially because it
matches that gtx 680 lightning that I
got in there I'm gonna pull off the side
panel later and show you guys it's
outstanding it has a thicker PCB which
basically amounts to better power
stability so again better overclocking
six rear USB three that did it dip done
there it is whereas the GD 65 I believe
only has two rear USB 3 ports there they
are okay and it also has total fan
control so all the fan headers are using
PWM connectivity and finally it is
Windows 8 certified now some of the
similar things are the onboard buttons
OC Genie as well as v checkpoints so
that means you can use your multimeter
to actually check the voltages post LED
readout as well as their multi BIOS
switch which has saved my bacon on this
exact board when we had a power outage
while we were flashing the BIOS all we
had to do was switch to the other BIOS
and we were good to go
so overclocking this 3770k was
easy-peasy basically all I did was
adjust the CPU ratio turn off some of
the automatic turbo controls and
whatnots asked my camera very nicely to
focus on the screen for me change the
memory to ddr3 1600 megahertz CPU core
voltage to 1 point 2 to 5 volts and that
was it now all we're gonna do is boot
into Windows and see if we are stable
now for the GPU because I was able to
overhaul the Corrib zimble to get a plus
236 mega Hertz on the GPU boost for that
lightning gtx 680 so that's where a lot
of that extra performance is going to
come from validating your overclock is
essential there's a ton of tools out
there I still use prime95 I know it's a
little bit old fashioned but eight
threads of prime95 running for 24 to 48
hours you can make sure you use CPUs
that develop that you are running at the
clock speed that you think you're
running at and you can use real time GT
in order to make sure that your
temperatures are acceptable would I
rather have a look
cooller on this particular set up and
get those down to closer to 70 to 75
degrees yes however 85 degrees under an
artificial load isn't gonna kill it
because you'll never see temperatures
like this in a gaming environment or
even when you're rendering video so I
think that pretty much wraps it up for
how to get your board running at 4.6
Jigga hertz which is what they validated
out at the factory so let's go ahead and
do some testing now now I'd like to
introduce the tests that I'm going to be
running we're going to keep things
pretty simple we're testing a core i7
3770k against another 3770k but this one
overclocked so there's no difference in
architecture here so we're just going to
run a couple simple benchmarks we're
also testing a gtx 680 against a gtx 680
so again no architectural change so
we're just going to do a couple quick
benchmarks to see what we gain by using
overclocking optimized or certified
components versus ones that aren't so if
you guys don't already know the
difference between the gtx 680 lightning
the one in here with the massive heat
pipes all over it as well as the dual
fan cooler and just generally
beastliness that it's got going on is
more than anything else the fact that it
supports triple over voltage that means
you can actually over volt the GPU pour
unlike a reference gtx 680 this enables
better overclocking and better stability
and it also runs cool due to the fact
that it's got the awesome full card
backplane as well as again all the heat
pipes and the beastly cooler that it's
got going on I should run you through
the rest of this test bench so we've got
Crucial Ballistix tactical tracer ddr3
memory going on in here which looks
amazing there's those PWM phases for the
motherboard that light up when it's
under load so we are playing a game so
that's why those are all lit up and the
memories going nuts as well there's our
Big Bang board so I'm sorry I can't get
you guys a better view that we're using
a simple air cooler from beep light it's
not even particularly loud and we've got
an OC Z Z
50 watt power supply and we're running
off of a much confer most deluxe
SSD so the configurations we'll be
testing our stock 3770k with a stock dt
x 680 versus what we get with our quick
overclock on the 3770k with do CE
certified board and our maximum
overclock we were able to achieve on the
GTX 680 enlightening Edition see what we
gain from a few minutes of overclocking
for tests we'll be keeping it really
simple Crysis 2 the Elder Scrolls Skyrim
and doing a one gig video output test
converting to Windows Media Video and
rendering so at non overclocked stock
settings as well as with the overclocked
CPU it's not of a clock now and the
overclocked lightning GG exit CD so its
conclusion time and just for a lark I'm
gonna experiment with overlaying my
performance graphs instead of just
talking about them and pointing the
camera at them so basically this test
system is pretty beast and what benefit
do we get from having our overclocked
graphics card and overthought CPU well
the answer is it depends on the
situation so for example in Crysis 2 you
can see the performance difference
between our overclocked system and our
non overclocked system is only about 2
to 10 percent so what this tells me
because most of our overclocking was
done with the empower motherboard is
that Crysis 2 was not particularly CPU
limited so fascinating so the GPU was
more of a factor holding it back and the
GPU clock speeds didn't make that much
of a difference so it's possible that
the difference in performance could be
more to do with the memory the lightning
addition card didn't overclock that much
on the memory only a few megahertz so
once we moved on to Skyrim you can see
we see a significant performance
difference about 15 to 20 percent
depending on whether you look at the
minimum or the average of frame rates
that means that this overclocked
certified quick overclock that we did is
yielding us an enormous gain in
performance that usually is reserved for
upgrading to an edition
CPU now can you achieve this overclock
on something other than a Big Bang is
e77 empower the answer is probably you
can however this one is validated and
this one is ready to go so it's pretty
much guaranteed out of the box as long
as you don't get a total dud CPU now for
our quick video rendering test we saw a
10% improvement in performance so that
indicates to me that the CPU is faster
and we will therefore save time if we
are doing anything CPU intensive so in
conclusion there's not much going on
here in terms of the unexpected until
CPUs are fast overclocking makes them
faster and I hope you guys have found
this to be educational and informative
