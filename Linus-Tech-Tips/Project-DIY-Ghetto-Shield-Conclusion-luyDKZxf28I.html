now to learn more welcome to part 2 of
ghetto shield the ghetto shield device
has now been completed so we'd love to
give you guys a tour of our setup a
first slick why don't you walk through
the process of creating the ghetto
shield okay so what we used for the
metal on the back was actually just an
old side panel that I had laying around
and just grabbed a dremel you can do
with like snips or a dremel or in fact I
think we recommend you do it with snips
probably do it with snips just cut out a
shape for us the easiest one was like a
really simple T it will probably be the
easiest if you just do a really simple T
you'll be able to just hand bend it so
don't worry about that it's ghetto for a
reason so don't worry about that yeah I
just chuck it in a vise and then use
that to hold it in place while you just
bend it well you bend it and then at the
almost same time you can use epoxy you
epoxy it to the battery pack so that you
still have full functionality of your
controller and use buy another battery
pack insert so you can use this just
normally for your xbox or you can use it
to be the ghetto shield so then once you
have all that bent in place you're gonna
have grabbed some velcro cut a strip
that's about the length of the T on the
back and then just put the gritty side
on here and the fuzzy side on here so if
you want you can use your phone case
although honestly I'd recommend another
option we had was getting a like a
throwaway phone case yeah so you can
clip the phone in and out but then if
you use a case anyway having the the
fuzzy side of the velcro really isn't
that bad I've had this on my phone for
like a week now well we've been working
on this and it hasn't really bothered me
that much so yeah yeah so honestly the
best if you want to use this a lot
probably just have a permanent foam case
for it but it works this way as well ok
so then the app then the app so the app
is called splash top read it's free you
need the mobile version the mobile
personal version on your phone and then
you need the streaming version on your
desktop they're both free really easy to
install and don't come along with any
adware so that's actually quite nice and
then it is tuned more to work for it 800
by 600 not shield which is awesome
well we tried twelve of 1280 by 720 and
it worked and it was somewhat playable
if you're playing a game like a driving
game that doesn't really rely on twitch
reflexes but you're gonna get flash but
okay well if you're playing like an
arcade II style casual driving game
however for something like a shooter 800
by 600 was much much more responsive so
we'll show you guys a real-world demo of
what that looks like so vsync I'm going
to go back so I'm actually controlling
right now so through this dongle right
here which is just a regular Xbox 360
wireless dongle for PC if the game it
doesn't support full-screen windowed
mode it's not going to work with
Splashtop it will well you just run
windowed mode and then you have stupid
UI things which is annoying right yeah
okay you should probably find something
that works full speed windowed but it
will work if you can at least run it in
windowed mode okay so let's go ahead and
and sort of showcase its its combat
worthy now it should be noted that this
is not a drop-in replacement for a
shield shield has a custom UI for
launching games you may have noticed
that our computer here has to be running
at 800 by 600 in order to get this
working wear a shield allows you to just
stream from that desktop without funking
up all of your settings it doesn't have
the same kind of battery life as shield
it doesn't have the same kind of battery
life as shield you're just using the
battery life of your phone and of course
there's this sort of whole clunky
solution but there are some advantages
number one is you can use an Nvidia or
an AMD graphics card totally doesn't
matter
in fact even for Nvidia graphics cards
you have to use Kepler with shield
whereas with this you can use use
anything because every time it's just
grabbing the image that's on your
desktop it doesn't care what your
graphics card is which is quite nice
which is very cool so I'm actually
playing right now here I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going to move over here so
you guys can actually see what the
gameplay experience looks like somewhat
here we'll do a side-by-side comparison
to show the latency which is actually
quite minimal in this setup so we have a
fairly optimal game which is running
fullscreen window like we're talking
about previously and then 800 by 600
it's it's pretty nice so the other cool
thing about our implementation is that
one of the advantages of shield is it
has a real
a good wireless solution well we're
using wireless AC because the HTC one
happens to support wireless AC if you
have a Galaxy s4 or an HTC One they both
support this particular standard so we
are able to get pretty reasonable Lego
there's a jump so you guys can see what
that looks like so we're able to get
pretty reasonable throughput although
like I said before 1280 by 720 really
didn't perform well enough that I'd call
it usable now I'm not a great first
person shooter player when it comes to
controllers anyway but I think there's
some baddies coming here we go boom boom
boom boom boom
so disregard them this is yeah assume
that the misses are because I can't aim
not because it's too leggy to use
because it actually isn't it's very cool
so don't think of this as a replacement
for shield think of this is more like a
test her to see if you like it yeah
see if you like the idea instead of
spending three hundred dollars spend
three dollars like including the cost of
the glue to make the thing and find out
if it's even something that you'd care
about and it's it's kind of a fun little
project it was fairly entertaining to
cut a side panel and strap it to a
controller and play a computer game on
my phone and this all assumes that you
actually have an Xbox 360 controller in
the first place which not everyone will
we figured there's probably a way to get
it working with a wired one using an
on-the-go cable that that will work but
you will only be able to play Android
games for now on here on here there's a
new thing of streaming software I forgot
to point out that sound is streamed as
well from the PC and you can have it you
can have it come through the PC and
you're playing on here so if you're in
the same room and you have a nice sound
system or you can just push it to the
phone or there's there's tons of
different settings there's another
program that people are oh I guess
person it's a single guy is working on a
contra of the name of it right now and
don't have it brought up but it is going
to be able to send controller input
through the phone to the computer and do
the same type of dealy so eventually
you'll be able to have a wired
controller plugged into your phone
through an OTG cable and then be able to
play games without using this somewhat
fairly difficult to use
don't move so there you go guys that is
project ghetto shield Thank You slick
for making this possible no problem it's
actually kind of cool it works
surprisingly well I'm not good don't
forget to subscribe - tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos don't forget to comment on this
video let us know what you think of the
ghetto shield and don't forget to like

fantastic hair or dislike it if you
don't like his beard</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
