signal 10 kilometers away to Alex and
Brandon over at the SFU Surry campus now
we've actually played around with
ubiquity x' dish based long-range Wi-Fi
before but I did not set it up properly
so while we did manage to send a Wi-Fi
signal across our parking lot which was
further than we would have been able to
do with a conventional router that
wasn't that impressive but that all
changes today Mike from ubiquity is back
and he's going to be showing us how to
do it properly
looking for an affordable and reliable
VPN private Internet access encrypts
your Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP check it out today at the
link below so Brandon and Alex should be
in this parking lot right here so as
long as there's no tree branches or
decorative log things in the way of that
hopefully we'll get a signal so are you
guys set up right now okay as Alex
started building dishes or anything yet
okay yep go ahead and put it back in the
car we're not gonna use it that one
should be fine for this project but
because of all the mist in the air we
actually changed gears a little bit and
instead we're gonna use the rocket a/c
gen - you've got chain one and chain
zero which are your vertical and your
horizontal these are connected to the
antenna right here we've got some
indicator LEDs that are you can actually
use to see in real time like if you're
pointed the right way though don't worry
there's more precise ways to do that and
then you've also got an additional
antenna spot here for GPS all that's
left on here on the front is this dish I
want to make sure this doesn't get
dented or anything like that that'll
change the shape of the signal and then
what was this one called together a feed
horn that's where you feed it hello
it's Alex how are you guys doing so far
we're a vote at the stage of attaching
the satellite to the stand okay do you
know how to power it not a clue okay
well you guys should have a big battery
yeah it's charging right now it wasn't
charged yet mostly D charged over the
weekend cool well why don't you guys
finish up what you're doing all right
boom pull so we're like pretty much
we're very close to being done now also
my hands are freezing I feel like that
having a red camera just makes you more
official and nobody questions if you're
allowed to be there we might be getting
kicked off because we're we need to sit
to connect between the two campuses
isn't technically campus property so
although we do have permission to park
we might not have permission to build a
Wi-Fi antenna so where are we aiming
exactly kind of to the right of the toll
tree
can somebody point at the tree that the
tall tree can you can you look at the
tall tree max there's to the mall
security the car park that we're on is
technically the shopping centers so yeah
we don't have permission to work here oh
okay
the great thing is like right after we
film the intro today I was like wow
everything's going so smoothly but
through the fog of war I couldn't see
it's just fun so we got completely
kicked out of the parking lot which
would be bad except now we're inside
where it's warm which is nice and we
might have through that great big window
behind me a direct line of sight to the
Burnaby campus I'm not entirely sure but
we'll be able to find out it's our best
bet at the moment and we're warm which
is great so so theoretically all they
have to do is fire it up set it to our
SSID and then configure their antenna
and we should be able to start dialing
them in assuming we have actual
line-of-sight which we can't verify
until we do that so this is
approximately what we want right we
can't even see those trees anymore
that's crazy
holy crap so if we're firing like you
know 10 city blocks away we're not
getting any st. are we at least I have
this handy tripod to support me as I go
through this please tell me you guys
have two Ethernet cables yep I got it
and we do have two Ethernet cables Oh
yep this makes way more sense now okay
good all right it says this site can't
be reached
okay so now you guys have to do your
darndest through the fog to point at SFU
Burnaby do you know roughly like what
heading I should be pointing at or
anything the idea was that we were gonna
have like binoculars and we were just
gonna kind of look at each other and
that is clearly not gonna be a thing I
probably underestimated ya and looking
at where you guys are looking out of
that building I don't see how we're
gonna get a link also if this doesn't
work we have permission to go back up
onto the parking log so we're back
outside hopefully it doesn't rain again
at least now we kind of know we're
supposed to point
it's sort of like that way by where that
great big crane is I think those also
are pictures that were taken like a year
ago so who knows if we can't hit the
parking lot when they get out there
one of our staff actually has a place
that is almost exactly due south of here
which means we would basically just
align ourselves with the window and
point straight out of it if we have a
line of sight to it oh we are set back
up again you're set up okay fantastic
yeah sorry we're exploring other options
since otherwise we were just kind of
sitting here being useless while you
guys did all the work and we were
thinking Tyler's house might actually
make sense I don't know if you've been
there before
oh yes I have
okay Team B is heading to a new location
on the roof of one of our staffs houses
we think that it's gonna be a little bit
easier to hit because it's almost
directly due south of here so it's a bit
easier to eyeball also there isn't a new
building that went up since we scouted
the locations pretty good we had some
food no there's like kind of a sunset
actually the Sun just sets so we don't
really have great light anymore but it
was pretty fantastic right before we
started filming so this video at the
very least is gonna look like garbage at
the end like I feel like garbage so the
video might as well like kind of like
the middle right corner middle right
what's the right corner okay yeah that's
that's a horrible descriptor like the
north corner can you see the building
kind of to the right of that one with
the red on it right what so there's like
a white box on the top of it I think
okay I see it
so basically do you see that why
box wait no hold on let me double-check
because I actually might not have put
our our pin on the exact window that
we're at no I didn't hold on one second
let me just correct that all right I
can't think of a better way so okay just
make sure I have that mark in the right
spot because even a couple of degrees
like if we can get you guys locked in
then we can just adjust until we hit you
I'm trying to get the height right now
which is kind of hard to do because
we're supposed to do like two degrees
but this is very far from level it's all
like this so I think it would maybe like
five degrees is good but you've got it
to two degrees ish yeah if because this
whole roof is like
ah I have such a headache right now yeah
that's good so if I just like if I just
like scan past like kind of fast do you
guys see a blip yeah nothing at all
yeah not a thing all right I think it's
time to call it guys
thanks everyone good work today well I
mean the kind of work that's good but
like doesn't achieve anything okay so
it's been a few months and we are back
at it again this time there's a bit of
wind to toss my hair I've got binoculars
they're not great binoculars I've got a
rooftop and I've got a clear shot to
Maple Ridge now we already realized that
we don't have a pole for our stand here
that seems to have gotten lost at some
point but the good news is I'm on my
parent's rooftop and the odds of them
having a random pole sitting around
somewhere very good one did not stage
that
I can smell success that looks pretty uh
look pretty almost ready to be called
steady this wasn't right so it's like
that way ish or like over there we're
not totally sure oh right
we are polled it should have really
brought a compass hey hey there buddy
yeah I think it's because we're
reconfigured with different static IPs
and stuff so I think you might have to
factory reset it yeah the thingy and the
thingy you'll need to find a small
thingy
I really wish Mike was here because I'm
looking at some of the tools and the
thing and I don't even remember ever
looking at this stuff yeah okay I'm into
the spot where I need to login okay cool
you bien tu BNT you four up b4 but and
for nut tea for testicle yeah I don't
know which of us is the is the access
point and which of us is the client and
I think it matters man okay what antenna
do you have set Rd 5g 30 30 DB I wait
what wait a minute you just shared your
location with me five minutes ago is
that you okay so the Golden Ears bridge
is right behind you so you guys are in
Pitt Meadows okay so there's the Golden
Ears bridge holy crap that's really far
away how close are you guys to
identifying where I am
very very not close we definitely should
have had binoculars but yeah
if I was looking past you what would I
see past you if you're looking past me
the the river basically we're like Rays
beside the river there's a bunch of
trees bunch of trees not gonna do a lot
for me okay now we're talking and what
part of it is directly behind you you
see how it's got four sets of supports
that's part of the problem right now I'm
having a really hard time seeing the
water because I think there's a lot of
trees and crap along the shore and also
the waters Brown which definitely
doesn't help okay I know where you guys
are okay so my building is the one with
all of the like kind of blade looking
things on the top of it you can't see
that well okay why didn't you guys kept
binoculars
yeah I've got like a gigantic golden
bounce all right do you want to start
bouncing then I'm gonna start bouncing
it baby like you guys are so far away
man I don't know if there's any way
you're gonna be able to see this but
okay I'm gold damn you see me yup I see
you know yes I can see it oh okay well
that there you go that's where we are
all right need me to hold it up so that
you guys can aim I think we're good now
huh I can a oh so excited do you know
how far we are uh how far are you I
think it's about 12 kilometers it's like
8 miles for the American viewers it's
far ok cool you're on speaker cuz we're
recording everything okay
don't say anything incriminating you
know okay
so how would they search for me just the
alignment tool so the align tool though
should work now that I have set an
access point frequency and they should
be able to just see stuff thank you
I'll give you a call if we need any more
help which we probably happen okay okay
bye
all right hey
okay so theoretically right now we are
about is setup as we can be turn on the
audio indicator and now we just have to
try and hit each other whoa whoa whoa
what what why wasn't this coming up
before I didn't even touch it we hit him
I didn't even adjust it where ad/da
current signal minus 80 decibels that is
well within the threshold took us up
Brandon we got two bars baby okay that
beeping is really friggin annoying I'm
gonna turn that right off there down
okay so should I have internet now no
wait
okay we should be able to share a file
between our two computers at the very
least okay so here we have it
I can see Alex's computer after you
Linus folder that's very nice okay here
we go this is it
two Meg's a second dang so that's 20
megabit from here to 12 kilometers away
under a bridge somewhere Brandon don't
die all right so do you guys want you
know what why don't I do the fine tuning
for now because you guys had something
to aim at exactly whereas I could be
just kind of close ish yeah okay so that
just got worse are you guys looking at
the indicator right now - yeah it just
went down for me so I'm a little bit off
to the left give me one second okay
is that better now um it's not as good
as before really
I still have 74 oh wait hold on hold on
hold on don't don't change anything yet
okay no changing anything okay I'm at as
good as I've seen yet so you can go
ahead and you can try and adjust your
height and or your whatever and let's
see what we see but I'm just gonna push
it a very small amount 73 71 72 okay I'm
going to need to like put a box
underneath the front leg of our thing
haha fantastic I can't believe how
aligned we were at the start based on
how small the adjustments that I'm
making are yeah we just did our vertical
adjustment and that did that goes down
to 71 so I think that I can't be any
more aligned okay well you can try
horizontal like let's just see what
happens just play with it just a little
bit oh wow that's much worse yeah this
is like fractions of a degree okay so
all that's left now is for me to play
around with height then oh that's better
for me that's better
- 67 yeah - 65 I got four bars baby four
bars come check it out oh damn we got
four bars let me see if I can get a
little bit more we're at negative 61
damn okay should we do another speed
test okay I'm ready to copy the bigger
file dang fifteen Meg's a second a
hundred and three
the megabit Wi-Fi over 12 kilometers and
it only took us six months to set up all
right I think that's pretty much it
gentlemen so all that's left to do now
then is tear this down because we don't
actually need to be Minette work
connection between the roof of my
parents building and a park somewhere in
Pitt Meadows but it was still cool to
see this in action actually freaking
working and I think it's probably got a
lot of gears turning in your guys's
heads in terms of how long-range Wi-Fi
