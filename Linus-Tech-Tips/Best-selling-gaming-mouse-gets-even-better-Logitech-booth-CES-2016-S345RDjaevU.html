to you by Squarespace build it beautiful
so here in the logitech suite they
assured me that what they're showing off
is really really exciting so I'm going
to run you guys through it really quick
this is the box that comes with but I'm
not going to show it to you to to
clearly here because I want it to remain
a surprise and I know some of you are
going to go ahead and rewind the video
to see what that box said before it
started moving around that is a stupid
strategy you just need to keep watching
the video stick with me here we're going
to go through it so this is the product
that they have on display as their main
showcase piece it is called the g502
proteus spectrum yes my friends g502
proteus spectrum they have changed
exactly one word about this product so
it still has the same pwm 3366 sensor
widely regarded as about as good as it
damn well gets anywhere from two hundred
to twelve thousand dpi without any
tracking issues anywhere along that
range it's got eleven programmable
buttons it's got their same hyper
scrolling wheel that I loved so much on
my old g9 except for the fact that I had
to flip the mouse open over in order to
press the button and then turn it back
over it's like yes I'm going into Excel
mode did you turn it over well here that
C is still right behind the scroll wheel
so it's all good you've got five
different dpi presets or less or less
they corrected me I was like so it's got
five dpi preset modes they're like up to
five like okay okay so I don't have to
do that I totally get it
that's fine it's still got a braided
cable it's still got that same
rubberized grip on the right hand side
and it still got the same high quality
switches it's still got slippy pads on
the bottom it still got removable
weights what the hell did they change
Linus how is this a showcase piece at
CES are you kidding me okay so they did
not change I know I said I'd say the
thing they changed but I didn't Todd
they did not change the price so the
price is still the same so finally the
one thing they changed they added RGB
lighting so we remove the word core we
add the word spectrum we removed the
blue LED or we don't remove it but we
add a red one and
green one so now it's got all the same
effects that you can control through the
Logitech Gaming software whether it's
you know you want it to cycle through
the different colors and time with your
spectrum headset and you're actually
doesn't even use spectrum in the in the
names of the keyboards do you use SPARC
this one spectrum oh for crying out loud
well there you go it's like wait a
second so it can cycle through colors it
can breathe it can just set to a static
color that matches the inside of your
case although case RGB lighting has
really come a long way in the last
little bit and it's the same mouse that
you already know and love and many of
you do given that they're saying it's
what is it the best-selling Mouse right
now on the market except now with RGB at
the same price so you just get a little
bit more for your money to LEDs and a
whole four additional characters written
on the box so don't miss any of our CES
