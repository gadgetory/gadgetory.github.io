skin you've got the sickest decals on
your elite controller you've wrapped or
painted your car so it looks and
definitely drives like Lambo but your
once fresh and flashy PC looks like a
generic pre-built with nothing but
boring old LEDs
well my vain friend do we ever have a
solution to your supremely first world
problem now hydro dipping is nothing new
we're just pretty sure that nobody's
ever done it to a $1200
RTX 2080 TI before speaking of things no
one's ever done
no one's ever segwayed like this today's
video is brought to you by the iFixit
Marlin screwdriver set features five
specialty precision screwdrivers held by
either a hard or soft rat case check it
out today at ifixit.com forward slash
Linus
for those of you who aren't familiar
with hydro dipping it's the process of
transferring paint to an object using
water Hydra dipping can be achieved with
almost any three-dimensional object
whether it's your favorite boring coffee
mug that needs revitalizing or a bland
set of car alloys that need to look dope
for the fast-food drive-through now I
know what you guys are thinking
Linus please paint and computer hardware
that sounds like a recipe for definitely
success what can go wrong yes
but hold on guys unlike some of our
previous arts and crafts projects
involving paint this time we won't be
relying on a perfect masking job or
steady hands because hydro dipping
allows an entire object to be coated
simultaneously and hopefully evenly for
a unique look so this right here is
actually our first attempt at this a gtx
1060 from a soos that we used to make
sure we were doing it right and to make
sure that our orange black blue and
white color scheme looked good for my
part I think it looks awesome so then
it's time for us to do this for real
step 1 then I guess is clear some space
on our trusty gamers Nexus mod mat and
disassemble our r-tx 20 atti i've
already pre loosened some of the screws
for the back plate here and it was
actually one of our new writers who's on
trial who did this so I am surprised to
discover that a lot of the other screws
are pre loosened as well so there you go
the card is basically disassembled Wow
wasn't that fast
gamers Nexus computer disassembly gear
highly recommended you too can be this
fast this card really looks like it's
been taken apart before because like
there's some clearly kind of improvised
elements to this biz thermal pad on top
of thermal pad but only here in here
like here it's not like that it just
looks like you're struggling to put for
the Cheaney oh my god it's good yeah the
genuine question that what is the
difference between fettuccine and
linguine I think the amount of thickness
okay but you know what I don't know but
that sounds credible enough that I
believe you for our next trick we need
to heat up this plate right here because
Nvidia in their infinite wisdom has
decided to go the Apple route of sealing
up their products with glue rather than
with screws why they would do this the
problem with heating up something like
this is that it's literally a heat
think like it's designed to have a lot
of thermal capacity so it takes a while
neat
oh cool
for our next trick we'll be moving these
four screws which will allow us to
remove this PCB that's something we
don't want a hydro dip because it will
read it the next thing we're gonna do is
remove these four screws followed by
this one which will allow us to pop off
what this shroud II do death and then
pull this ribbon cable out of the part
of the cooler that actually makes
contact with the GPU itself so there you
have it that's the actual cooling core
of the r-tx 2080 Ti so there's your
vapor chamber there's your fins cool we
can put that aside we're done with that
for now we don't want to paint that
because that would actually hurt our
thermal performance one thing we
definitely need to do is pull these fans
off here the last thing you want is
paint in your cooling fins quite
literally the last thing you want we
seem to have had a bit of a roadblock
here during the assembly process and
video routes these cables through kind
of small holes plug them into this PCB
and then glues them in place why they
would do this once again we don't know
this sucks it's just so unnecessary all
right
and of course the PCB itself is glued in
we ain't done yet folks so now that
everything's completely disassembled
we're just gonna give it a quick wipe
down with isopropyl rubbing alcohol just
to make sure that any surface
contaminants have been removed this is
painting basics 101 just making sure the
surface is clean before you try and
paint it finally we want to mask any
parts of the card that we don't want to
end up with paint on them such as the
thermal pad contact points on the back
of the backplate here and remove any
decals that we intend to put back on
when we're done so next is priming right
now as with any good painting project
and even shoddy ones like what we're
doing the key is a good even coat of
primer so see vanish
remember kids lots of thin coats don't
try and do it with one thick one like
what I'm doing right now because my time
is limited today
alright guys so our primers dry and it's
time for us to apply paint to the
surface of the water now I've never done
this before but I'm assured that it's
very easy and only a complete idiot
could it up so hopefully I managed
to do it correctly how close do you get
nervous I've never painted water before
it
fifteen ten years is that enough okay
okay and then this white shirt dang it
okay and then we're gonna do a practice
one with like a stick okay and then this
is my stick for shushing away all the
other stuff shake it around shake it off
shake it off you know get mighty Swift
okay so definitely needs more white
leave more white leave more white now
you can see this stuff's dry so this is
just a mess and then when you're when
you're done with that attempt do you
just kind of shoosh it over into the
side and then you just go again
so what do you think guys are we ready
to do a piece of the graphics card here
we go oh that was not oh that was not
good
okay so then I'm gonna kind of go okay
and yeah I can see why people do this
outside oh boy oh man oh this one's
gonna be just all blue and my hands
going in oh good okay well I did say
that if I couldn't do it I'm an idiot
okay I think if I just go a little
lighter with this I can control the
pattern that I'm getting a little bit
better so I just want
like a stronger industry okay that looks
pretty cool that one's not bad okay this
is fun I like arts and crafts hmm okay
that one I'm a little iffy on okay ready
here goes fight you covered your eyes
there wouldn't blame you at this point
oh I can't get it to go in at an angle
oh it's going into my gloves
oh no thanks Dennis you're truly
wonderful human being
what's so bad okay so we left it
overnight and actually I gotta say I'm
I'm kind of coming around to how it
looks I think this is gonna be pretty
sick so the next stage before we can
reassemble it is to give it a couple
shots of clearcoat and then we can put
it back together and hope that a it
looks good and be that card that was not
reassembled properly last time even
still works at all so here we are guys
the card is reassembled almost there we
go and I think it looks pretty freakin
fantastic
I wasn't sure about that back plate when
it was first done but actually you know
what it worked out pretty darn well so
the last thing all that's left then is
to find out if it still works all right
let's press this power button hey it
works at least a little that fan might
be dead though so maybe that fan is just
not quite in there so it's uh do you
happen to know which one is that fan
there it is nice it works
don't celebrate too much yeah we still
gonna launch a game or something so here
we are we're in rise of the Tomb Raider
now I think the in-game benchmark for
this game is actually kind of broken
right now but as long as it runs at all
even if the results aren't reliable
that'll still tell us whether this thing
is indeed functional looking pretty
smooth there so that's it then folks
hydro dipped r-tx 20 atti it's still
working
freakin fabulous we're not necessarily
recommending that you try this at home
but we will say that it was lots of fun
and looks really cool and you could do
it at home we're just not recommending
it speaking of things we recommend
