600 rollable solar charger unboxing
that's the entire unboxing so let's go
ahead and let's walk through some of the
things that are interesting about this
so you can charge or direct power
12-volt system such as the things listed
here although for my purposes I'm mostly
interested in not necessarily military
vehicles but more along the lines of you
know okay not car batteries but like
electronics and stuff haha charge
wireless electronics so charge the
internal batteries of your laptop
satellite phone GPS cell phone PDA
internal batteries etc you can charge
regular batteries including whatever
else you can connect to it so this guy
the 600 is a 10 watt solar charger
operating at 0 point 6 amps although you
can get a 5 watt or 20 watt version
weighs 1 pound yeah okay not that heavy
complete with 15 feet of wire and over
in connectors a three-year warranty
durable construction with marine grade
components you'll be resistant and
weatherproof performs well in diverse
conditions including both hot and cloudy
environments that's kind of cool can
roll around a three-inch diameter and
wraps around wrap around fasteners to
keep roll so let's have a look at it I'm
going to try it out of course so this is
the kind of thing you might take with
you on a camping trip when you don't
want your you know your game console or
your laptop or whatever else to run at a
battery while you're while you're away
do not fold or crease so that's
important you roll not fold or kriesel
so you rolled up this side out here's
the included connector which looks
somewhat complicated to be perfectly
honest see how this works here so 15
foot cord so this is your positive and
that's your negative and then this bag
plugs right into here so I was hoping
you would have something more along the
lines of like a a USB connector or
something like that it's 12 volt solar
powered battery charger and how pray
tell
do i connect this to something maybe
there are accessories well you know what
we can just fire it up with a multimeter
and then we'll worry about that later
give me a sec here guys so I had to go
get batteries for my multimeter just to
to film this little test for you guys
here but you can see that even in this
room where we've only got the window
open there it's producing about three
volts so hold on that's just yeah there
we go and then if we want to go ahead
and switch to haha yeah meter see many
amps that is hmm Oh hold on I need to
put it there fascinating so let's take
it outside it's a cloudy day but it
claims to perform and cloudy conditions
so let's see you at this so here we are
in the yard and I'm rigging it up here
haha now we're getting about nine point
four volts so we're still not getting
quite the 12 volt rated output but if
you have a look at the weather it's
actually starting to get a little bit
dim in the evening here and it's a
completely overcast day so
yeah so we're getting about 11am side of
it your milliamps whatever that is I can
ever remember I very very rarely use my
stupid multimeter so for anyone who
knows what that means is that the 200m
setting and I forget so there you go oh
there's the problem right no no hold on
hold on hold on hold on oh yeah i know
that one's good for milliamps let's hook
up to that one let's see if we can get
it here this way I'll know for sure
sorry guys I apologize ok so that was
milliamps then cool ok so 11 millions
what I get 12 volts nine volts nine volt
something like that ok my assistant
doesn't care um basically yeah i went to
the i went and i checked out sort of
what kind of accessories you have in
terms of what you can hook up to it and
there are some approved accessories but
it looks more like kind of a DIY type
product right now or like I build your
own solution around it type of product
you can get a car lighter adapter so you
can use it to charge your car battery if
you're ever like totally screwed having
something like this in your car might
not be a bad idea as far as charging
electronics goes it's going to be a
little bit trickier to get it set up
because you're probably going to have to
make your own adapters but if you are
handy with soldering iron it's
definitely an option so thank you for
checking out my little unboxing on
rolling of the power film solar don't
