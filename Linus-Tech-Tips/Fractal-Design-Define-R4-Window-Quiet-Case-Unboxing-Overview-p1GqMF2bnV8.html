Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
Haswell system for unbelievable overall
performance welcome to an impromptu
unboxing that involves my hobo stabbing
knife we're testing the puncture
resistance of the packaging here so it's
not very puncture resistant but what it
is is a well padded so this is the
fractal design define r4 excuse me
define our core which is a silence
optimized case and is pretty similar in
to the previous generation define our
three and the even older generation than
that define our two other than that is a
bid has been updated with some more
modern features so we are actually using
this case for a build guide which is why
we have to have one and why we have to
open it but I realized we've never
actually done an unboxing of this case
before so I figured we better do that oh
that's why we have our camera mounted on
a tripod and our microphone hanging on a
boom pole above me and sort of all these
unusable things for unboxings so you can
see it has ample packing materials
around it which is the reason why my
knife was not able to penetrate all the
way to the case itself through the box
it does use a hard foam as opposed to a
soft foam which isn't really my favorite
but as long as it's nice and thick and
you can see ours arrived in one piece
then I'm not going to worry too too much
about it so pretty much the main
difference between the define r4 and the
define r3 it's going to be on the
internals the r4 is a little bit wider
than the r3 so it has a bit of a a bit
of a boxy look and a bit of a wider
stance than most cases it's quite
noticeable in person although pictures
don't really do it justice so yeah as
long as you don't have sort of as long
as you're not one of those people who
has a very precise place to put the
computer then you don't have to worry
too much about the extra width what the
extra width also does is it gives you
better compatibility for things like
taller CPU coolers and some more cable
management
mother worden all that there's a manual
and that leads us to the front of the
chassis so the front of the case is
looks pretty much like to define our
three or a define our two we've got an
LED logo up here as well as a front door
that swings in one direction or the
other I guess we'll have to figure out
which there we go that swings open to
reveal some sound dampening foam right
here as well as two five and a quarter
inch base that can be removed tools
Leslie a little bit of something like
that a built in fan controller that
gives you options from 12 volts to 7
volts to 5 volts with an integrated
switch which I personally like I think
it's better than the dial at least I
know exactly what I'm doing with my fans
and last but not least a AHA removable
front cover oh it's not removable it's
on a hinge now look at that
okay well that's different as well as 2
front 140 millimeter fan mounts and a
this piece is removable removable filter
that allows me to not only remove the
filter itself oh this is cool check this
out here I am I've decided to use this
case for a build guide never actually
built in it because I just know the r3
is awesome and I figured this must be
more the same but that gives us access
to our 2 front 140 millimeter fans as
well as the filter which looks like it
just slides off which is pretty cool now
there we go
so that just comes off like that you can
clean that put it back you can replace
the fans and all of this is completely
toolless because the fans just clip in
just like this yeah there we are
alright so we're just going to leave
that out for now for the sake of going
more quickly so we can go ahead and put
that back in place you were able to see
the hard drive cages there before but
let's go ahead and start with the front
i/o so you've got your front power
button a front reset button to front USB
3 ports 2 front USB 2 ports microphone
and headphone jacks you've got two 140
millimeter fan mounts here in the top of
the case with their trademarked Maju
vent design so you can see you can't
even see through those but what you do
is you actually remove the covers and
then you can replace them with fans
should you see fit on the other side of
the
you find it is completely plain nothing
out of the ordinary there and then
moving around to the back you find
another 140 millimeter fan with a 120
millimeter option 7 PCI expansion slots
with an auxilary one over here for
mounting things like I mean the old r2
and r3 had a little fan controller that
mounted there for example so there's a
few things like cathode switches and
stuff like that that you can mount there
a bottom mounted power supply with noise
dampening foam on the inside of it and
now it is time to open up the case so
there are thumb screws on the back which
huh Wow contrary to what I normally see
with cases they are not too tight for me
to remove them by hand a lot of the time
their thumb screws but they're so tight
you have to get a screwdriver to open
them up the first time anyway unless you
have like you know huge forearms which I
don't have this is the side panel
windowed version of the define r4 which
is awesome I'm so glad they started
doing a windowed version of this case
you can get a non windowed version and
in fact you can get the case in a
variety of different colors but black
windows Oh IR white okay the white ones
really nice too but black window for me
was pretty much the way to go I really
really wanted that that window and that
black thing so there we have it here's
the protective covers for these which
are important because you could see one
of them had a nice big scratch on it but
the window itself is crystal clear these
are the interns trying to get out of
here without getting in the way the
camera good work sir alright inside we
find the inside of the case so there's
two to five and a quarter inch bays not
to list which is interesting money cases
these days have toolless five and a
quarters personally I don't know how
much it matters because the last time I
mounted something in a five and a
quarter inch Bay was a while ago but
there you have it then you've got five
harddrive cages so those are three and a
half inch or two and a half inch hard
drive cages up here at the top these are
removable and rotatable and these ones
have tight thumb screws so I'll have to
get Ravis screwdriver alright so I
grabbed the screwed yellow boy and I got
this screws that's okay
so I grabbed this screwdriver so I could
show you guys how this works so not
only can you remove this cage in order
to give yourself more airflow for your
graphics card or your CPU area or
whatever else from here in the front of
the case so the air is really being
drawn in through these vents in the side
that's what gives the define are for its
sound dampening properties because
you've got that foam in the front and
then the sound is deflected away from
the user that way but you can also
rotate them and this is cool because it
allows you to get that done if you know
that you're not going to be using a ton
of drives or if you don't mind having
the cables for your drives come out the
back of the cages here which doesn't
look as nice from a cabling perspective
you can mount it this way which has the
advantage of see that better air flow
and giving you the option to still mount
some drives in here because this blocks
most of the air flow meaning you have to
use really pressure optimized fans and
even then you're not going to get much
air through them so this just gives you
that that flexibility the bottom cage
doesn't rotate unfortunately but it
shouldn't really need to because you
don't have to you know you don't really
have to get much airflow over to the
power supply area itself speaking of the
power supply area you've got a here we
go filter on the bottom of the case that
covers not only the power supply but
also the bottom mounted 120 millimeter
or 140 millimeter mounting point you
know what I don't think I've ever seen
anyone use it though this fan mount down
here on a case like I really think
that's pretty rare cable management wise
you've got your usual slew of cable
management holes including rubber
grommets down here by the power supply
grommets up here where you're going to
bring in your graphics card connectors
up here where you're going to bring up
connectors to your optical drives here
where you might run connectors to
wherever it is you'd run connectors up
here and here where your 8 pin power
will likely be located you've got a nice
large CPU cutout as well as another
included 140 millimeter fan and I did
talk about there being more room for
cable management in this case due to its
wider stance so let's go ahead and take
that off there we go you can see more
noise dampening material here so there's
that is going to be helping this case be
noise resistant
and lots of cable management room so
you've got a good looks like about an
inch or so of cable management room
behind the motherboard tray here where
you can easily run a 24-pin connector as
well as some well laid out little
strapped points so that you can keep
your cables pinned down so that you'll
actually be able to close that side
panel when you are done with it
I believe they've also got do they
Stoker that's just amounts on the back
of the motherboard tray hmm only one way
to find out grab an SSD and see if
anything lines up because that was a
feature that they had on yeah there we
go
two SSD mounts on the back of the
motherboard tray right there and there
and I think that pretty much wraps it up
