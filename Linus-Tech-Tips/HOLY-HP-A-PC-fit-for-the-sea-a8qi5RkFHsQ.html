done some weird stuff over the years
everything from that moving train
computer to that blue sail abomination
PC 888 but this one this one might take
the cake for me this is the PC y6
Odyssey special edition yacht themed
aluminum chassis yes my friends a boat
shaped computer case
so welcome then to this episode of holy
and why did you bleep that I said holy
ship it's a boat
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description so I guess we'll kick
things off with a classic Linus tech
tips unboxing of the PC y6
you got your instruction manual you've
got some LED strips that is a nice
include RGB LED strips included nice
touch Lee and Lee you've got all one of
their little feet and you've got the
chassis itself that's interesting
flying in the face of Lee and Lee's
usual style holy crap there's ducks here
there's baby geese adorable they're
gonna bite you nice they're gonna bite
you now what you see here is the Royal
Canadian goose yeah he's annoyed why
don't you okay sorry okay I'm done I'm
done I'm done they're both hissing at me
sorry back to the case so in the back
you'll find the numbered serial number
so I've got 421 out of 500 here then
working our way up we've got the power
button on mounting points for an SFX
power supply oh this is cool here are
the mixer knobs for your red green and
blue LEDs on the RGB strip I think you
can put pretty much a full-size graphics
card in this thing in addition to the
ITX motherboard there is actually a
steering wheel in the top here check
this out so there's like like I feel
like I would want to put like a little
guy a little guy standing under the
under the protected cover there to steer
myatt's to my computer we've got four
sets of Windows that go all the way
around that are going to give you a
really nice view of your graphics card
as well as your motherboard for thumb
screws that let you pop
the entire top cover off so all the
building is actually done before you put
the the windowed top cover and front
deck on we've got one cooling fan here
that's set up as an intake though I'd
imagine with some creativity you could
probably throw another one into the
front if you didn't need that many hard
drives or SSDs look at us let's go to
adorable little boat anchors right here
is the PCI Express extender that is
going to allow you to install that maybe
not quite full length I'm gonna have to
I'm gonna have to try it later and then
right here is your drive cages where you
can install well drives you can't tell
me that it's a boat case if it doesn't
float
oh I step on this look that's not dog oh
that's dog food
holy Sh there's a lot of goose crap here
watch yourself Dennis nope no this
girl's all right that's how we goose
p-probably oh it's time for the maiden
voyage of the SS
fails a lot huh oh this is awful
Oh everything about this is awful time
to pull this baby out and see if I can
get all the goose crap off of it so now
all that's left to do is try this baby
out and see how it goes as an actual PC
case and not a boat that's one way to
dry things when you don't have a way to
do it properly after the fact oh yes ooh
either thoughtfully or by blind luck and
knowingly and l√©a it's about a 50/50
shot at either of them I have enough
clearance for my modular interface to
have an SFX L power supply and just like
that
this has gone really cool spoke too soon
you never install the video card from
this angle before this is a new one look
at that
dang I actually ended up really liking
it I'm sorry I threw it in a lake but uh
I guess it's gonna be 32 gigs of
Dominator Platinum's what's that for
this is a clip to hold down the LEDs
it's really thinking about cable
management it's not the thing that they
normally let's see if she still works
whoo here we go cool let's see if my RGB
mixer still works yeah
so I guess that pretty much wraps it up
then thanks for watching this episode of
holy ship ha ha ha ha is it funny the
second time probably not where I started
out kind of making fun of a really weird
product and ended up really liking a
really weird product you know what else
seems weird at first but that you'd
probably really like ting there the
mobile carrier focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction well
that is weird right when you call them
there's no robot there's no menu there's
no press one there's no press pound you
don't you don't even mash the zero to
talk to an operator no you just talk to
an operator and what's crazy about that
is the average ting bill is only 24
bucks a month per device they do this by
making their entire pricing model very
different from their competition it's
kind of like buy what you need and use
exactly what you need and pay for only
what you need instead of having to buy
in bulk and some kind of like a plan
knowing that if you overuse your plan
you'll get billed out the butt and if
you under use your plan you're
effectively paying for something that
you weren't going to use so all you got
to do is head over to Linus ENCOM we've
got that linked in the video description
and try out their savings calculator you
enter the information from your last few
bills how much you paid how much you
used and find out if you will save money
by switching to ting and if it does look
good in your favor
switch it a ting there then they'll
cover 25% of your cancellation fee up to
75 bucks and if you use our link again
that's in the video description
you'll get another 25 bucks in service
credit or towards a new device so what
are you waiting for
so if you guys like this video hit the
like button get subscribed and all that
