motherboard from MSI although it is a
value sort of tiered board part of their
eseries of boards it has a number of
features that we've come to expect
including a three year warranty military
class two concept components so we have
Super ferrite chokes as well as solid
capacitors that's going to give you more
current delivery and a longer lifetime
so they say 10 years lifetime here but
if you flip the box over to the back you
can see that they figure for gaming it
can operate for up to 12 years non-stop
and for office use up to 40 years so yes
in the year 2050 you could still be
using your age 67 rig should all of the
other components that last that long and
should you so desire pretty cool so we
got OC Genie 2 thx truestudio Pro which
gives us an ultimate audio experience ok
so basically it looks like there's a few
different settings that are supported by
the thx audio got Winky 3 which allows
you to surf the internet chat with
friends maintain hard drive data edit
Doc's and photos without any OS although
I still recommend installing an OS for
the best possible functionality of this
board you can see it as compatible with
Windows 7 ok here we've got instant
overclocking oh yeah that's right that's
what their control center software as
well as click BIOS so it supports UEFI
BIOS just like all of MSI is P 67 867
boards here we have a drivers and
utilities DVD here we have a quick
installation guide showing you how to
use some of the basic things that plug
into other things with this particular
board here we've got some of those
convenient M connector things those are
for plugging in your front panel
connectors more easily here we've got a
user guide couple SATA cables as well as
a molex to SATA power adaptor and we
have an i/o shield all right we got some
environmentally friendly cardboard
packaging here and then we have the
board itself so this is an age 67 board
which means it is compatible with all
Intel LGA 1155 processors from their 4i
5 and 4i 7 families
here we go let's just pick this guy up
okay and it is not compatible with LGA
1156 processors bear that in mind and
another thing is that no matter what
kind of a CPU you're using you will have
support for the onboard graphics but if
you're using an unlocked CPU you will
not have support for unlocked
overclocking on an h-60 seven chipset
board so bear that in mind so here we go
let's take the sticker off and let's
start with the CPU socket in the center
of the board as I'm apt to do so there's
your LGA 1155 socket supporting all the
latest second generation intel core I
series processors here we've got our
four pin power connector and it's almost
ideal location on the top left I
wouldn't mind seeing a little bit
further up here we got our CPU fan okay
we've got dual channel ddr3 support
we've got clips on both sides some in
some ways I actually prefer this system
to the easy one side clip mechanism
because it always feels a little weird
putting the RAM in the one side and kind
of meter squeezing it in there and then
putting it down and clipping it shot I
kind of prefer to open up two clips put
in the RAM and then clip them both shut
anyway next we've got our 24 pin
connector in its ideal location along
the right-hand edge of the board and
here we have four SATA to three gigabit
per second ports and to say two three
six gigabit per second ports so those
are going to be what you want to use for
like an SSD boot drive if you get a new
state of three SSD or any other
performance drives you have attached to
this board and these ones would be more
like for your storage drives your
optical drives all that kind of good
stuff here's our chipset heatsink which
is using a pretty stylish overall look
very angular in design looks very nice
see if we can get it to actually focus
on it there you go alright next here
we've got Wow four front USB headers one
two three four here's our front panel
connectors okay moving over we've got
front panel audio connector right here
in terms of expansion options this is
kind of a this is kind of a new one for
me on a more value oriented board
oh please focus
on a more value oriented board we've got
a PCI Express 16 X slot here and three
PCIe 1x slots so there is no legacy PCI
support on this motherboard you will be
expected to use all updated PCI Express
add-in cards which I don't think is
necessarily a bad thing
all right next we've got 8 I don't think
I've ever seen an optical audio pour it
up there so we've got a combo ps2 port
we have digital audio supported by
optical and then we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6
USB 2.0 ports no USB 3.0 on this board
guys we have HDMI Gigabit Ethernet VGA
DVI ok so we've got quite a range of
output options for display and then
we've got onboard 7.1 audio thank you
