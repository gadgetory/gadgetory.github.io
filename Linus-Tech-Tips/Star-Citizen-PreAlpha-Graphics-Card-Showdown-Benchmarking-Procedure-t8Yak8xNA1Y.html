DFM dogfighting module arena commander
star suzanne fighter whatever you want
to call it it is finally released and we
have decided in our insanity to test it
just to remind you guys this is a
pre-alpha release a pre-alpha release
that is like we're lucky it's not
setting their server room on fire I
spent the majority of my time testing
this game just trying to get it to
launch because that was extremely
difficult and if those are things that
are going to annoy you don't bother
because it's going to happen there's
going to be problems running this game
it's going to be difficult it is a
pre-alpha all of that being said we
wanted to test this game because we see
this question all the time can I run
Stars is and a lot of people look at
this game as it's extremely hard to run
and all that kind of stuff and yes
that's true it's not easy to run but in
its current form without any extensive
graphics options and without any of the
ludicrous things that we're expecting
them to do with the graphics in the
future it's not actually that bad we'll
get more into that in a second so you'll
be able to see with this video a rough
estimate of how well you'll be able to
run this game with these graphics cards
but in the future this may not apply
with the release of alpha or beta or
even the full game these numbers will be
very different and will probably update
you along the way although we'll ask for
feedback for you guys from that point I
was kind of surprised to see the results
that I got while running at 1080p due to
expecting this game to be a lot harder
to run that it actually was the only
results that kind of surprised me a
little bit where the AMD ones although
before the AMD guys run down into the
comments start freaking out don't worry
guys the second we jump up to 1440p the
story kind of changes a little bit and
we see that trend we've been seeing
lately where AMD cards are running very
well at higher resolutions in comparison
to its competitors cards which is kind
of interesting actually and I'm
expecting if we wouldn't even higher the
resolution we'd see this trend start to
scale out even more I don't necessarily
expect Nvidia or AMD to be rushing out
driver improvements to tune themselves
to this game it's a pre-alpha that
we make a lot of sense so don't expect
any help in that aspect that being said
who knows what Robert space industries
might do they could release a patch that
makes it harder to run they could
release a patch that makes it easier to
run who knows it's a pre-alpha we will
have to see although as of right now
it's not that ridiculously hard to run
it's not an easy game to run by any
stretch of the imagination but I
actually kind of expected it was going
to be harder to run than it is so that's
actually kind of a relief it looks
absolutely beautiful and it's feasible
to run on a fairly high-end system which
is actually pretty cool upon launching
into the hanger module all you need to
do is pick a ship first thing I'm going
to go with my Super Hornet because it's
a freaking Super Hornet so I don't
really know why you'd pick anything else
currently in the dogfighting module it
looks amazing
fairly recently they've updated some of
the animations that go along with
getting in the ships and stuff so this
is pretty cool I'm going to show you
guys this part just before we're able to
select what module we actually want to
run
alright looks great sounds great that's
all good that loads up the arena
commander thingamajiggy you can't do
spectrum match yet so we're going to do
drone sim and then we could try the ven
duel swarm but I don't necessarily
recommend doing it if you're going to
benchmark because there's quite random
so we're just gonna do free flight once
we launch in here this is the ideal
starting position sometimes it'll start
you looking a little bit further down
but you see this animation which really
screws with your frame rate so try to
make sure you're facing at about this
position
and then kind of just look up and I
target out of one specific massive
asteroid first and then I kind of just
fly this direction and shoot at it every
once in a while once I get really close
I will turn to the right until I see
another big cluster of asteroids and
then fly towards a large asteroid within
that cluster and then I just continue
doing this until my two minute benchmark
is done I'm not going to bother to show
you guys the rest of it because it is
kind of very dumb so is it launching
yeah no no you know what's funny is how
many hundreds of dollars that we've
spent on this game yeah yes friends for
less than the amount that some of us
have spent on digital crap for a game
that isn't even close to release yet

star citizen performance pre-alpha star
citizen performance in one particular
module and a couple of games and a
couple resolutions anyway that's the
whole point
dislike it if you thought it sucked give
it a share if you think other people
need to know about this exciting new
game so that they can all throw all of
their money at it the way that we did
leave a comment let us know what you'd
like to see in term
star citizen benchmarks from us moving
forward or if you'd like us to just shut
up and stop talking about it and as
always guys you know the support link is
in the video description where you can
buy a t-shirt at our affiliate links to
your bookmarks and I'm pretty sure
there's another thing right direct
