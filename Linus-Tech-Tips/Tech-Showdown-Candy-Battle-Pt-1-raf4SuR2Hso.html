we were thinking we should call it
something else but then we were talking
about other names and one of them was in
use by a law firm or something so tech
showdown it is except for changing the
format now it's two teams competing to
build a themed PC okay that's exactly
the same as before but now we've got
four days so we're gonna build something
totally kick-ass this season is brought
to you by synergy and the theme is candy
now in a stunning turn of events it was
brought to my attention this morning
that rather than each Luke and I being
paired with a professional mater Luke
and I will be squaring off against two
professional modders so I wish us the
best of luck building a candy-themed PC
and a candy-themed full desk set up to
look fricking awesome
or at least be tasty failing that yeah
and there's no real clear rule so go
Tech showdown is brought to you by
synergy 2 in partnership with g.skill be
quiet and cable mod synergy 2 makes
sharing your mouse and keyboard between
multiple computers so simple that anyone
can use it
learn more at the link below so in
fairness to you guys you should
understand who you're building the
system for we've got three celebrity
judges our minor celebrity judges are
gonna be Riley from NCIX tech tips and
Steve from gamers Nexus and then our
sort of headliner celebrity judge is
actually iJustine so she's coming all
the way up here and the three of them
are going to contribute to who actually
wins so keep that in mind you've got
okay we take this board markers we got
markers baby we got three markers we got
all the markers oh yeah that's one big
difference there's no barrier hey we
don't need markers everyone everyone can
see what everyone else is doing this is
like tripping me out like I want to hide
stuff but okay I think the first thing
we have to deal with though is your your
sponsor logo shirt hear that okay so you
got to do one of two things yeah you got
to start eating these to fill in or we
could find some taste you look
ridiculous
I think these belong over there don't
they oh yeah
called dumb-dumb yeah these go over here
you guys these are dum-dums
there you go here you go smart guy you
don't have those in America do you I
think no thought they call these Rockets
down there oh no our Smarties no wait
our Rockets are your Smarties and you
guys don't have our Smarties you have
the lame like powdered candy Smarties
so okay my grand idea that has si you
are everything that is wrong with us
staying organized you just put a not
working marker back in the pile of
working markers yeah it has to be okay
so where this can go though is another
level
there's one where it like comes out of
the top of the computer and it flows
down and then there's like a little
river but then how do you recycle that
that's gonna be pretty pretty bonkers
but one thing that I observed about
these tables that were using already is
that they could actually be configured
that way but how do you get it back up
okay um so here's the thing there's no
fixed budget for Tech's showdown it's
all within reason so I don't really see
any reason you know that's not within
reason why we couldn't obtain something
to help us do that now here's how we
take it to like a crazy level though
this is I believe what a 180 watt CPU
okay that would be awesome I mean what
could unlock the power more than this I
feel like that might be hard to
communicate to judges we could have like
an info like this is how it works
card that's worked in the past yeah we
could man oh okay having like four days
to work on this in some ways is actually
like okay okay yeah okay okay this is
not attached so these are just like
sawhorses so let's open our case first
and then we'll worry about how to plan
it's a big Tower basically blank canvas
yeah it's a big Tower okay okay so here
here we got add like I don't want them
to know too much we need yeah okay buy a
thing that would come with that but it
would have to be continually which makes
a little bit difficult yeah and how do
we keep it from like dunking up
we need to run for a little while okay
so these like our designs that it won't
matter but our extra stuff we will have
to be pretty careful about sure but like
the the river part I wouldn't actually
worry about it too much but we just have
to get it back that's the part that I'm
really worried about cuz yeah you can
like slant the table and stuff oh no we
can't do that because that would make a
terrible user experience
I imagine that they're going to get
really creative and do all kinds of
crazy stuff and that might hurt them
okay so khon kaen yeah it would be it'd
be difficult right okay cotton candy
that you can apply and it starts good
like you know to keep it that clean
fluffy yeah
stick it yeah so the desk see the desk
has but we have to do some paint work
with the desk okay the Jess kind of
remind me of like you know when they
pulls halfy at the fair they're always
on a big workbench and stuff and I was
like and sometimes they've got those big
machines that like stretch the taffy
like automatically it's like how cool is
it to build that if we have this big
table what if we created a game like a
Candyland again Candyland
or candy land game works right board
game where you have to move spaces and
then we incorporate L like Lyle
incentives or something or whatever on
the table
we could paint this white and then do
you like some sort of a like um like a
big game board or something maybe no
problem
okay can you help me okay priorities
priorities
let's get you not looking like a smack
tool what's this
it's does it sound down mission
accomplished
whoever word of the t-shirts may have
ordered the wrong one for Luke Colton
I mean it's alright yeah it looks not as
bad but it's definitely still kind of
bad because like look at this look at
this and look just start eating candy
then I tried but you think Colton try
which is why we're here so this pretty
much goes on this side
what about like regardless of what else
we think is that not sure yet where is
this gonna sit like if this is a
complete battle station you're too big
objects are gonna be your case and your
monitor so if your case sits on this
side you know it blocks off so much then
your monitor say sits on the front like
do we do base amount like on the
monitors the monitors on arms how do we
keep it like super clean do we mount the
chassis like yeah does it fit inside the
sawhorse things or something like that I
mean you want to be a showpiece you
don't want to hide it but it's huge I
mean it blocks up yeah do we really want
to have it and then Ulsan you got the
back here I mean you're gonna be looking
at from this side put on the same I mean
so then you monitor your battle stations
here it doesn't have to be just like we
could we could incorporate like ice
cream I mean ice creams technically yeah
right like what's our like for things
we're doing right so like are we putting
a gumball machine in this like that's a
major you know cut grind there seems too
easy though it's here yeah okay like how
does a gumball machine and a reservoir
work together like what if one dispenses
gumballs and one dispenses Aurora fluid
like it's a two loop system but it's not
ones
Andy and one's coolant so should we stay
away from stay away from doing crazy
paint because there's no paint booth
here there's no yeah the only thing I'm
thinking you got this white canvas on
these sawhorses I think that is
something that we should do so we could
paint we could paint this whole tabletop
white starting point - I like the I mean
I like the maple but if it doesn't work
in the theme then you know so these are
standard regular key caps so we might
even be able to buy a key cap set but
get them in time if we can get them at
like maybe NCIX or something or yeah or
just Amazon Prime so it's just the caps
of the keys that we can replace the
black ones with some color synergy - is
designed to be easier and more seamless
to use than synergy one features include
sharing from anywhere with automatic
control of any other computer without
reconfiguring SSL encryption to protect
your keystrokes from attackers dynamic
networking so it detects the best route
based on your setup and being able to
always run in the background on all your
operating systems so you can set and
forget and it even works across VPNs and
tricky home networks if you get the pro
version you can get access to other cool
features too like clipboard sharing
dragging and dropping files copy pasting
lock screen synchronization and lots
more
okay so Bob and rod are starting to get
a few good ideas but just because they
don't have a solid ton yet doesn't mean
they've been sitting on their hands
they've already assembled their monitor
and are well on their way to painting
their case and now time for a little
cable management this thing can go out
you know all the way through holes route
route everything down through it's like
perfectly clean I'm really hungry
wait this is their plan
yeah distract dude this is their whole
plan they know I like candy so they put
all his candy here to keep me from
working on the computer the whole plan
no you guys are mean you don't think I
can sit here with all this candy
anything between anything water cooling
it's probably coming from the supply
here okay so we we have to go see what
they have
okay yeah which we could go we could go
look at that yeah I know okay so the
mouse I'm taking off the question mark
there we can decide on colors later we
may go together or you know what we may
have to stay split up on all of this
there's some pictures well yeah we'll
just go we'll pick something really fun
we definitely need to spend some time
doing what they're already almost done
doing which is taking this baby apart
and figuring out but we need the
overarching theme first I'm gonna be
stressing for the next four days I don't
think our mods gonna be on par because
neither of us has the fabrication or the
painting experience that those guys do
like they do this all day what I was
mostly counting on going into today was
Luke having some kind of a kick-ass idea
like Mad Max or whatever
I mean he's behind me so this is a
little awkward to say but like his idea
was okay
it wasn't like game breaker you know I'm
having doubts about both well I think we
should go back to the original time it's
gonna Rev
I hope at this point I hope that we at
least turned in a computer I mean we'll
have some yeah we'll have something oh
my god what time is it it's - yeah
should we build it no cuz we have to
take this all apart - like we have to
paint this they're obviously painting we
can't not paint it maybe this is the
gold foil and chocolate thing so gold
all on the outside and then try to
chocolate as much as you can on the
inside so that it's a candy bar computer
interesting okay
and then we go with other candy for all
the rest so we get those multicolored
key caps and we go with other candy for
the rest and we go with chocolate bar
for the computer and then do we still do
the brown desk no I don't think it's I
think we could because there would be
enough contrast of the outside of this
being gold how gold can we go though
without ruining like airflow and how
good of a job can we do of that this is
a super modular case this won't look at
where they're at cuz I come worried
about stuff like this
yeah but how are we gonna put it back in
tidally because what ever kind of oil
we're using is not gonna be that strong
we could do that we can do foil for some
parts but I think a lot of its gonna be
like this is definitely gonna be painted
this would be okay okay okay okay
so we go golden wrapper outside and then
inside all Brown we could do cream and
so we could do cream accents with a
brown base we can mask off these fans
and we can go like brown frames so we
are we are we are brown and brown and
cream I don't think this is an
incredible idea but I think it's a
doable idea and then we might be able to
spend more time doing crazy things with
the rest of the film it took us until 2
o'clock to even sort of have an idea it
wasn't finalized by any stretch frankly
our whole value add on this one is the
idea because our execution isn't going
to be better so yeah I'm really worried
right now will Linus and Luke continue
sucking next week don't wait to find out
you can watch part 2 right now on
floatplane follow the link in the
