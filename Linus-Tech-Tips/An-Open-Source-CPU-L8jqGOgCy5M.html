the tub thinking how could I design my
own CPU okay maybe that's not quite as
likely but let's say you work for a
large company that is legitimately
looking to do something like that where
do you even start I mean I guess I could
you licensed intellectual property from
Intel or arm
I mean maybe but that kind of thing is
gonna cost you an arm and a leg so then
what other options are out there well
when we asked just that question to
Christa asana vich co-creator of risk
five he was quick to bring over actually
like a team of people and one of these
computers based on risk fives free and
open architecture which surprisingly
functions like a normal PC and I cannot
wait to tell you guys about this thing
after I tell you about our sponsor noble
chair the noble chair Icahn series real
leather Edition gaming chair was
designed in Germany and inspired by
luxury sports car interiors you can
learn more at the link below
so there's a good chance that right now
you're thinking okay cool tech demo
quake 2 but I'm not gonna have one of
these open processors in my computer
anytime soon so why should I care well
you should care because you actually can
expect to find risk 5 processors in your
gaming rig much sooner than you'd think
just for the time being not as your
primary central processing unit so
NVIDIA and Western Digital along with
around a hundred other companies will
soon be shipping products with RISC 5
micro processors onboard due to it
having better efficiency better security
and that sweet sweet royalty-free
license to boot in order to appreciate
how cool RISC 5 actually is though we do
need a bit of a history lesson so back
in the 1960s Ram was made using tiny
magnetic cores and these were super
duper slow compared to the vacuum tube
processors of the time so to make sure
that the processor wasn't just wasting
cycles while the RAM was catching up
every instruction from the memory ran a
little program hardwired inside the
processor called micro code with the 70s
came the space race where scientists
figured out how to put a lot of
transistors on one chip which meant that
now fast memory could be put on the same
chip as the CPU so then micro code just
got thrown in the garbage bin of history
right no just kidding
a lot of that same micro code from way
back then actually still exists in
modern computers for software backwards
compatibility
the legendary Intel 8086 CPU pioneered a
new computer architecture x86 but
you could make the argument that it was
just hastily thrown together by Intel
engineers in just a few weeks and they
had no way of knowing that it was going
to become the de-facto home computer
architecture for decades to come thanks
to its use in the original IBM PC but
with an average of one instruction being
added every couple of weeks since its
inception x86 has gone from poorly
thought out to today ballooning to over
1500 instructions I mean think of it
like the English language how many words
do you use on a daily basis versus how
many are in the dictionary in a modern
world this kind of bloat leads to
inefficiency
not to mention needless difficulty for
anyone that wants to make a processor so
why is everyone still on x86 well
software support is a big part since
porting Windows and all of its programs
to a new architecture has proven we
could use a word like inconvenient I
mean look at Windows RT on arm total
flop on top of that creating a good
architecture in the first place is
freaking hard to be clear those guys
that threw it together they're pretty
talented
they were pretty talented team and it's
been a lot easier over the last several
decades to just make the transistor
smaller and pack in more of them at
least it was easier until Moore's law
kind of petered out and huge leaps
forward in CPU speeds basically stopped
in the last five or so years so clearly
a more usable alternative to x86 or arm
was needed one that was created with
modern processors in mind and using the
power of hindsight that other
architectures didn't get to benefit from
which is where Krista and his team come
in creating the reduced instruction set
computing v or risk v the core of which
has less than 50 instructions instead of
1,500 ish there will probably be more by
the time this video is out
now those if
instructions are locked down and won't
be changing in the future so ideally a
program made 60 years from now using
risk five should work just fine on
processors being made today I mean
slowly though but what if those 50
instructions aren't enough well risk
five is customizable meaning that if say
Nvidia wants to create a processor that
is specialized for AI in graphics they
could actually add extra instructions
for their task allowing for greater
Hardware specialization and much greater
efficiency but of course there have been
open source instruction sets before and
they have never taken off so back to
that question why do we care about this
one well the members list for the RISC 5
foundation is kind of a who's who of the
biggest tech companies including but not
limited to Google Samsung nvidia tesla
IBM and a hundred or so more including a
startup founded by the creators of risk
v sy 5 to help kick-start risk 5
adoption and to avoid that chicken and
egg problem with hardware and software
by creating the world's first commercial
risk v silicon so this right here is the
fu 540 which stands for freedom
unleashed 540 definitely not what else
fu could mean towards lock down standard
stuff so this $1,000 processor is well
not particularly fast with 4 cores that
on this particular board can clock up to
1.6 gigahertz on a 28 nanometer process
node but breaking speed records is not
exactly the point when this processor
was announced with support for Linux
back in February you could run pretty
much nothing on it but here we are just
six months later and 80 percent of the
Debian software library has been
compiled for risk 5 meaning that all you
need to install almost
is a quick app gank command but of
course the point of this board isn't for
you to run games on it even if it does
run quake 2 thanks to this configuration
so we've got the processor here which
sits under this tiny little heatsink and
fan then we've got the RAM so that's 8
gigs of DDR 4 with ECC we've got Gigabit
Ethernet right here we've got USB and
let's see yep we've got a micro SD card
reader right here but what makes it
unique is this chip connector right here
this allows for you to connect the CPU
to well anything you'd like so currently
on the table in front of me here we've
got another unit that's connected to an
FPGA
that handles PCI Express Lanes for what
you could kind of consider a larger
scale motherboard here so now we've got
a graphics card this is just a regular
HD 6450 AMD graphics card we've got a
samsung m dot to drive on the other side
plus we've got a bunch more i/o but you
know what else you could connect here
this allows companies to build whatever
custom solution they would like on to
the size 5 processor board so the TLDR
is that it can interface with whatever
FPGA or custom silicon is needed while
getting the advantages of the risk 5
instruction set Linux support and also
all of the intellectual property and
legal work that sci-fi has already put
in to make sure that things like the RAM
work with the CPU so in the future sigh
v is looking to have sort of a Domino's
Pizza approach to custom chips where a
company can come in and add on bits for
say image processing or autonomous car
AI but now you're probably wondering why
have it open source then if sy5 is
syncing all this time into making these
custom chips work and into the RISC 5
instruction set
why not lock it down so they can keep
all the money well say that a company
has a driver issue normally they would
have to go to Intel or whoever to get it
fixed causing a lot of work on both
sides and potentially making the company
have to disclose what exactly they're
working on whereas when the software and
the hardware is open-source the company
can just fix the bug and then upload a
fix for the community afterwards the
open source nature is also appealing to
companies because if they invest in
developing for risk v and sy v goes
under then all of those man-hours don't
get wasted what's going to cause the
real stiction of risk v though is in
education because it's royalty-free the
most popular computer architecture
textbooks being published right now and
courses being taught in undergrad and
graduate programs around the world use
risk v to show students how computer
hardware works on a very low level
previously some fantasy architecture
would have to be used and then when a
computer engineer would enter the field
they'd finally get to work with a messy
proprietary ISA so since very few
students will switch up what
architecture they use once entering the
field the idea here is that you can
expect a lot more custom Hardware being
made using RISC 5 in the future in your
hard drives in your graphics cards and
your cars and maybe maybe someday even
as the primary architecture of your home
computer and you'd be running games more
complex than quake 2 by that time
speaking of time if you find yourself
with some time on your hands an audio
book is a great way to fill it and
actually it's a great sidekick for
summer activities like hiking sunbathing
on the beach running road tripping just
enjoying downtime outdoors and more
audible.com has an unbeatable selection
there for the asking including audio
books featuring celebrity narrators
bestsellers and just about anything else
on your reading list there's everything
from fictional works like a Song of Ice
and Fire by george RR martin
all the way to well drier more technical
stuff if you're more into that sort of
thing
