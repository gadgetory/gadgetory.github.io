that razor showed up with both a like
mock-up of the razor toaster and an
actual working razor toaster do you guys
think that's crazy you are not even
ready for what's going on in here
this box right here is being seen here
at LTX 2017 for the first time that
label on the top says prototype inside
to those of you wondering no it is not
Project Valerie it is not AMD epic but
it is from AMD you guys are you guys
ready inside this box being unveiled for
the first time rx bag ah
inside this box is not only an AMD rx
Vega but a completely one-of-a-kind
unboxing experience that will only be
available in very very limited
quantities because to produce it
required designers from the Netherlands
UK Canada and the US and the cost of
building it is extraordinarily high so
to see one of these in person is going
to be a very very unusual experience
this is this is crazy
the sleeve of all right leg ah that's
fine I want to do it okay okay the
cardboard flap Aymara taiga bring pixels
to life okay here we go whoa now just
hold on a minute here oh do I have to
leave it there okay so we're gonna plug
it in can I pick it up can I hold it so
this is a prototype device that AMD is
calling the hollow cube and it's some
kind of holographic display that
actually syncs with Radeon software to
project certain images if there's like a
driver update or like a new game you
want to play or if your DVR capture is
on no it is AMD red because it is all
about team red
Wow I was looking at it from the wrong
side so you guys we're actually seeing
it so inside the cube is another cube
it's a graphic we actually have a video
that we can play just in case you can't
see it we're going to we're going to
leave this out so you guys can see it in
person but I'm going to go ahead and
fire that up so from the front there's
just this graphic this uh this rotating
cube that seems to be hovering
completely in midair
unbelievable have everyone kind of seen
it can you see it moving around in there
how about you guys on the front there
pretty cool eh but of course that's not
the main announcement today the main
announcement is the unboxing of the card
itself so first up we've got DisplayPort
a TVI adapter DisplayPort to HDMI
adapter we actually really couldn't use
one of these last night and a manual and
finally being seen for the first time
here today
the final shroud design of rx Vega okay
so this is the limited edition of rx
Vega it's got a brushed aluminum finish
this is a completely new architecture
for AMD everything about it was built
from the ground up it's got a new
geometry and pixel engine it's got
hardware accelerated async compute if
you guys are
to directx12 and you're into vulcan and
it features eight gigs of HBM to memory
so per consumer card right now to get HP
m2 memory you got to buy a $9,000
graphics card and i can't tell you what
the price of this is going to be but i
can tell you it's going to be a lot less
than that also it will have better
support for free sync than ever before
and that's supposed to be kind of a kind
of a hint because AMD will be officially
announcing many many more details about
RX vega tomorrow at 7:30 Pacific 7:30
p.m. Pacific so stay tuned for that I
promise that this would be unbelievable
and that you guys would be absolutely
blown away and we're going to start
getting the phase 2 going here because
that wasn't it
it's getting real now because Vega would
have been a big deal and Vega is a big
deal but inside this box is a
DisplayPort table and a big fat power
cable and an alienware area 51
gaming desktop running a 16-4 32 thread
thread ripper and what we're going to do
here today is we're going to show you
doom running on RF data and thread
Ripper for the first time and and a few
lucky audience members will get him on
it now we got to hook it up so everyone
keep that level of excitement going for
like two minutes okay two minutes
there's still more y'all can't go on
Andy yes you guys are about to witness
some live and in person line of tech tip
troubleshooting so I'm just going to
perform a quick memory swap here okay
okay I'm going to try the other Ram
still beeping oh man I'm freaking out
here you guys it's okay
I'm fine right now everything is fine
putting other memory back in
you guys are going to cut all that out
right okay okay we got this the next
thing I get to unveil today Oh
ah white headed is everybody's favorite
benchmark when they first fire up their
computer with a new processor task
managers 16 cores 32 threads I got
special permission from Alienware to be
the first person to run Cinebench in
public on thread Ripper okay I'm
actually going to need an assistant to
come in and click it for me because I
want to hold this up so everyone can see
it ah
actually maybe someone who's already on
the stage okay yeah can you click run
click run 16 threads alright 6p whore to
see you yeah 16 course 32 threads that's
how fast it goes what can it fly it
might already be done 28 66 okay this is
exhausting I think I'm allowed to tell
you this gosh well it's running it like
2.6 right now but it's it it's shifting
a lot there will be more details on
thread Ripper I need team to launch I
