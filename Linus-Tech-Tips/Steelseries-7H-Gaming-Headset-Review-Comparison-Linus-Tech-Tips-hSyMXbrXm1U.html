headset I promise to do a bit more of an
in-depth review than I typically do and
so I wanted to just give you my
impressions of this headset now that
I've had some chance some time some
chance to game on them listen to music
on them watch a movie on them and I
gotta say first of all I'm gonna ruin
the surprise a little bit I am very very
impressed so we're gonna take a bit more
of an in-depth look at them they are
extremely comfortable even out of the
box now my my de-facto gaming setup is
actually a pair of Sennheiser HD 5 5 v
headphones you can see these are pretty
beat up these have been around the block
I've been using these for a good couple
years so they're extremely loose
extremely flexible extremely comfortable
well broken in headphones and then for a
microphone I actually just drape a PC
161 also from Sennheiser around my neck
so the microphone comes up to my mouth
and then the headphones sit on my head
like this kind of like that yes the HD 5
5 5 sigh I found most gaming headsets
by comparison completely unsatisfactory
for music and just in terms of general
audio quality now I've also got some
other points of reference that I want to
to give you guys here so I have the
SteelSeries Siberia v2 this is their
their white model it's a little bit less
expensive actually quite a bit less
expensive than the 7h a little bit less
expensive than quite a bit less
expensive again then even the HD 5 v 5s
on their own
I have the SteelSeries 5 hv 2 so this is
their previous top of the range also
with the retractable mic also has the
detachable ear cups for travel and such
honestly I I didn't like these nearly as
much as I liked the new 7 H I find out
of the ones in front of me the most
comfortable are probably the well broken
in HD 5 5 5 s and the Siberia v2 these
are extremely light and then with a
close runner-up being the 7h but one
thing that I can't I can't knock it for
is the fact that it's brand new
whereas I've actually used both of these
extensively this is still probably only
seen about a week of gaming you
so it's still a little bit tight you see
how tight that is compared to the the
Siberia v2 which is quite loose and the
HD 555 which are obviously completely
loose because they're so old another
point of reference that I do have for
this particular little review is the
Sennheiser PC 350 s these again are
quite well used these are a closed
headset so that means actually I want to
talk a little bit about what that means
so first of all the ones that I
typically use for gaming the five five
halfs of those are an open headset
hope--and headphone that means that I
can hear my surroundings and my
surroundings can hear whatever I'm
listening to on my headphones these do
not block sound at all these go right
through to the speakers so anyone around
me can easily hear what I'm hearing one
thing that you do lose a little bit with
an open headphone is some of the
directionality because it means that the
sound coming out the right earphone is
coming out here and you can potentially
hear it
through the left earphones so you don't
have quite the same directionality that
you would with a closed headphone like
the PC 350 which is designed completely
for gaming this is a purely gamer skew
from Sennheiser so let's talk a little
bit about what makes the 7 H honestly in
my opinion one of the best values on the
table in front of me it has a lot of the
premium features that you see on the
really high-end headphones headset so
it's got these rotatable earpieces that
makes them extremely comfortable no
matter how your head is shaped it's got
the detachable thingamajiggy here where
you can take this much honestly I don't
think this is a very useful feature but
I guess if you travel with your headset
a lot it might come in handy I don't so
that make me why I don't don't see the
value of it you've got other really cool
things too though you can actually
exchange the earpieces so you've got
these plethora ones or the cloth ones if
you prefer a more closed listening
experience so that means that much like
the PC 350s you cannot hear what's going
on in the right ear through the left ear
because these actually form a pretty
good seal with your head and make it so
that not only can you not hear your
surroundings your surroundings can't
hear you and the sound is very isolated
from one ear between the ears so you can
either choose to have that listening
experience with the 7 H or you can put
on the claw
your muffs your muffs the cloth
earpieces and then you can actually have
a more opening with open listening
experience now I actually very much
prefer the HD 5 5 5 s to the PC 3 50s I
don't like the 350 s all that much
because I do not like the closed
listening experience but with these I
was able to put on the cloth pieces and
I found them quite satisfactory in music
movies and in games now with games
honestly this is a little bit better but
it's summer right now and I found my
ears got pretty warm with these and
frankly with any with any sort of
plastic e leathery material against my
head now I don't know where else to go
with this because honestly it's all
subjective like you can talk about it
has a retractable mic it has a
detachable cable here actually that's
one thing that was a big problem for me
my PC 350s recently died because my cats
my cats ate them here this is when they
were just little babies but you can see
that they have died now unlike the 5 v
5s which have a detachable plug here
which is pretty hard to take out but you
can take it out and you can replace the
cable and you can do the same thing with
the 7 H because it has a little mini USB
cable the PC 350s do not have that
particular feature I took the whole
earpiece apart and it's all soldered in
there it would be quite a bear to
actually replace it what else do I want
to talk about in terms of comparison I
think that pretty much covers it
basically these are about 50 bucks less
than the 5 v 5s that I'm using now they
do have a mic the sound quality is what
I would consider comparable to a decent
quality music headphone in terms of
music and honestly I very much preferred
it to the PC 350 s once I was able to
replace the earpieces
now the thing that really impresses me
actually is the price range because it's
quite a bit less expensive than anything
else that I would consider a comparable
in terms of sound quality it blows away
any other sort of purely gaming headsets
that I've used in the past and I don't
know if you've noticed in some of my
vlog videos that I shoot in my office I
so have some razor Carcharias headphones
in there and those are probably again up
with the more comfortable headsets here
but I found the sound quality was not
quite up to par with the Siberia v2 when
I tested them last time so I guess this
is just seven minutes of me rambling my
thoughts on headphones I just want to
say the SteelSeries has done a fantastic
job with this product I think that at
the price point it's pretty much
unbeatable and I was very very very
impressed with the SteelSeries 7h I
guess I'm gonna call this a review I
should probably actually talk about some
of the other stuff you can get it with a
USB sound card which has been a
lifesaver for me my onboard sound ID on
one of my motherboards and so I actually
used this the sound quality is I would
call it perfectly adequate but I'm used
to using one hundred plus dollar sound
card and/or a $500 receiver to actually
power my headphones so yeah it's
adequate it's about what you'd expect
it's it's only a $30.00 adder I think so
it's not that expensive it has a short
cable which has a an on-off low high no
just on-off for the mic and then volume
adjustment for the headphones and then
you can actually attach that to an
extension cable so if you have a
SteelSeries 7/8 you can plug right into
the back of the keyboard for your audio
and then if you do not then you can just
plug right into the back of the computer
it has kind of like chrome accents which
I think really looked nice and it has an
overall more solid build quality versus
previous headsets that they've released
I really like the retractable mic
they've really upgraded the look of it
versus ones that we've seen before so
here I'll show you the one on the five
hb2 it looks like a little like I don't
know tear drop looks very strange and
whereas this one looks more like
professional looking mic and that's
actually kind of similar to the one that
they have on the Siberia v2 which is
also a much newer headset than the 5hv 2
and I really do prefer it to the the mic
that sits next to your head which makes
you look kind of ridiculous if you're
not actually using it and you're not
actually playing a game so there I
actually gave some of my thoughts on me
seven each now I can call this
legitimately a review
I enjoyed it it's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
