GTX 590 compared to its closest
competition in terms of power and noise
so that would be the sixty nine ninety
as well as two GTX 580 s in sli so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to take an idle temperature as well as
an idle power reading on the GTX 590 so
the idle temperature right now is about
thirty-five or thirty-six degrees
depending on whether we can actually get
the camera to focus for you guys or not
there we go so thirty let's say thirty
five degrees on the GPU cores and then
we've also got our idle power at the
wall being about ninety six watts so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put audio
snippets at the end of the video so if
you just want to see just if you just
want to hear how these cards compare to
each other in terms of noise then you
can skip there otherwise I'll show you
guys the temperatures and power
consumption all along for all these
different solutions just so you guys
know for the max power I'm using the
batch size test as recommended by Sky
MTL from hardware connects I'm going to
repeat that test so that'll give me a
nice high GPU temperature as well as a
maximum power load so here we go so our
load power consumption for the GTX 590
clocks in got around 340 watts so we're
just going to record that is 340 and you
can see there's a cat investigating it
and our maximum temperatures after
running this particular little benchmark
or rather our stable temperatures are 78
and 79 degrees on each of the GPU so
we'll call that 79 and I really wish
that window would go away I don't care I
don't care 78 so there you go guys our
79 rather so we'll go ahead and record
that you know our little power well
there really is quite a dramatic
difference between the maximum power and
the and the minimum power in videos
really done a good job
of clocking down the GPU when it's not
being used you can see right now it's
actually stepping down right now so it
goes all the way down to 51 megahertz on
the GPU focus there you go very nice
very cool all right so there's my idle
power consumption for the Radeon 69 90
so we'll call that 132 and I should
write that on my handy little chart at
some point and then hold on let's just
do that and then here are my idle
temperature so it settles in around 41
degrees on the GPU that has less
ventilation so the one at the back of
the card and 39 degrees on the GPU at
the front of the card so there's our
idle values so here's the max power
consumption of the Radeon HD 6990 for
the sake of argument why don't we say
around 400
berries let's take the peaks almost the
peak so we'll say about 405 watts
because it sort of rises in dips so
we're running the 3dmark test and let's
have a look at what we achieved in terms
of maximum temperatures bringing up
afterburner here so our max temps peak
this is artificial but they peaked at
around 85 and 82 degrees on both of the
GPUs so here I'm just gonna make it
focus focus focus thank you alright so
85 and 82 degrees where my peak
temperatures on the GPS so let's call
that a 150 watt idle total system power
draw and bearing in mind that all of
these numbers for the power are coming
through an 80 plus silver power supply
so you got to kind of factor that in if
you want to figure out how much power
they're actually consuming so this is to
GTX 580 samples of them are stock
clocked reference designs and are idle
temperatures actually come in similar on
one of them okay so similar on this one
this is the bottom GPU at 34 degrees and
then quite a bit higher so the reason
that second one is quite a bit higher is
that there's only that much space for
the fan to draw air in whereas the GTX
590 is getting fresh air for both of the
GPUs going out either side so let's get
some load temps and load power
consumption going on here and then we
will have some commentary at about 465
watts the GTX 580 solution consumes the
most power out of all of the
configurations that are here so that's
going with the two dedicated dual GPUs
rather than a single dual GPU card in
both cases consumes more power it is the
highest performing solution out of all
of the ones that we've looked at so
to be considered as well although
sometimes the margin is substantial and
other times it's less substantial huh no
it's fairly substantial for the most
part just looking at at these numbers
here anyway
so yeah i'll show you the load temps
it's me and my pink shirt so for low
temps we're looking at 82 and 77 degrees
so that GPU that is starving for air in
the middle really well does star for air
a little bit and I think that's pretty
much it guys so stay tuned I'm going to
show you all the audio samples from
these cards thanks for checking out this
