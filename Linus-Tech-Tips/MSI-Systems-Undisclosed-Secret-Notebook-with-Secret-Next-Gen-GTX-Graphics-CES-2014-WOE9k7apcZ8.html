brought to you by NCIX com your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital we're here in the msi
sweet this is their systems and this is
the system this I mean they showed me a
bunch of other stuff and I was like okay
yeah i can make video about this this
isn't to show me this thing i'm like yo
okay we're gonna get started on that
right away now i can't tell you guys the
model number i can't tell you guys what
graphics cards in it i can tell you guys
it has a core i7 quad-core processor I
can't even tell you guys what this thing
is made out of but what I can tell you
is that it is incredibly slim just like
the GX 70 it has a 15.6 inch nan tien
display that'll be available in up to a
freak a resolution it has their dynaudio
better onboard sound it has a
SteelSeries multicolor backlit keyboard
with the SteelSeries Engine meaning you
can reprogram the keys to whatever you
want it supports to external displays at
the same time over mini DP and hdmi and
I fired up a game on it and I can tell
you guys that while I can't say anything
about the graphics because I can't say
anything yet this one right here the
gs70 it feels a touch faster than that
and that has a 765m in it so why don't
you guys take away from that whatever
you will but this looks like I mean it
is so light that's why I can't tell you
guys what it's made of it is incredibly
light and it actually doesn't even seem
to run that loud now this is a
pre-production model this is not even
finished yet but I am really excited and
I'm going to basically tell these guys
that if I don't get one of these for us
to do a full proper review of when the
time comes I will be sorely disappointed
now just because that was the one that I
got really amped up about doesn't mean
that there isn't other exciting stuff
here guys this is their GT series which
okay it kind of looks like MSI gaming
notebooks have looked like for the last
little while but what's the difference
ah yes this here on the screen so I
talked about the steelseries keyboard on
that last one full SteelSeries Engine
support now that means that rather than
oh you know we have five macro keys here
or
you know to macro Keys there this one in
addition to supporting 16.8 million
color RGB backlighting on the keyboard
with waves and breathing and all that
stuff you can now rebind any key on the
entire keyboard to whatever you want
whether it's a simple remap or whether
it's binding as a macro you can set up
an unlimited number of profiles and you
can do it all within the SteelSeries
Engine software that runs right on your
notebook it is a SteelSeries keyboard in
effect now that might not be that
exciting because that's a pretty
high-end model but what about this right
here this is the GE series which has now
also been updated with the fully backlit
steelseries keyboard so at this point
with MSI's next-generation gaming
notebooks you are pretty much no matter
how you slice it going to get an awesome
keyboard to go along with the powerful
graphics powerful CPU and all the other
good stuff in here and we're going to
close things out here with the first
that I've ever seen gaming aio so this
one right here has an 89 70 m graphics
card in it it's got a core i7 quad core
it's got all the stuff that you might
expect an aio to have well okay except
for that powerful graphics card so it's
a 27 inch 1080p display and you can see
they've actually got battlefield running
on here right now although this
particular game is not not very not very
touchscreen and optimized it does happen
to have a 10-point multi-touch screen
but of course it comes with a keyboard
and mouse that you could use as well one
unique thing about this from an Aiel
perspective is it has a matte display so
msi has stuck with this with their
gaming series products whether it's on
the notebook side or now the aio side
and they've received positive feedback
from the customers so there you go it's
back now this one over here this is the
AG 240 is actually a little bit
different does not have the matte
display but what it does have is a
smaller form factor so this is only
using a 24 inch display aw crap is a
24-inch bollocks see I doubted myself
but I shouldn't have it is a 24 inch
display this one right here also has a
core i7 processor and what's interesting
about this one is it has a
next-generation NVIDIA GPU so presumably
this will be a mobile graphics card
because this is actually pretty darn
slim but I think we can expect to see
some interesting performer
so again guys these are gaming aio so
they have things like the killer Network
prioritization that you would find on
MSI's gaming motherboards as well as
notebooks but just in an all in one form
factor guys don't miss any of our CES
