Germany where we are checking out what
BMW is calling next-gen they sponsored
our trip out here to show off some of
their visions for the future of
automotive technology and I am really
excited to see what they've got in store
so we're inside now where the big star
of the show is obviously their vision
and next unveiling here now we're gonna
get hands-on with these cars in just a
moment but we gotta wait our turn and
apparently this time slot is reserved
for none other than Paris Hilton so I'm
gonna sit and patiently wait and then I
will get you guys the update one moment
okay our turn so behind me is three
vehicles that are part of BMWs vision
next so that's the I next they actually
showed that last year it's more about
the sort of relaxed vision of the future
where your car drives you and you're
kind of sitting in a mobile living
experience this is the star of the show
today and this is the M next so it's
still got a ton of Technology in it
because this is their vision for the
future but it's technology that's really
geared around the manual driving
experience so let's take a closer look
at it starting from the front you've got
this spectacular mix of the old and the
new so you've got the classic BMW dual
kidney grille except it's not a grille
so it's a plug-in hybrid vehicle with an
advertised 0 to 60 in 3 seconds and then
a 62 mile range but because it gets most
of its power from electric they actually
don't have an air intake at the front of
the vehicle so this is instead edged
glass that actually lights up from the
side for this really stunning effect
that accents the thrilling orange paint
job just beautifully another really cool
lighting technology is BMWs laser wire
lights here so these use just these
single wafer thin glass filaments and
they're laser lit which really opens up
some new possibilities in terms of
designing the shape and the style of the
lights on the vehicle
another check that I've seen before but
not that that makes it any less cool is
the inclusion of 360 degrees of camera
coverage for the vehicle which wait a
second where's your rear view and side
mirrors
nowhere so my first time experiencing
that was actually on the BMW i8 wireless
demo a couple of years ago at CES it
works shockingly well then using screens
on the inside of the vehicle rather than
mirrors on the outside and you can see
that BMW is still committed to exploring
this concept
it improves aerodynamics and from my
experience doesn't degrade the driving
experience at all in fact in some ways
it was better because I had everything I
needed to see right in my cone of vision
they've got biometric door opening right
here and then this is cool so these
covers right here again in thrilling
orange are not just for looks these
actually improve the aerodynamics of the
car along with this air scoop right here
that serves a dual function as well
cooling the rear brakes then at the back
we find more of this mix of high-tech
and traditional so they've actually
borrowed from the air intakes of the m1
to create this glass rear windshield
that obviously you wouldn't be able to
see out of but you don't need to because
of the 360 degree cameras and again
they're using this like filament thin
laser lighting to create an utterly
unique rear to the car that I think
looks absolutely phenomenal if I didn't
need to drive kids around right so now
it's time for our autonomous level 4
demo right over there is a 7 Series
that's one of about 80 cars in BMWs
level 3 and level 4 test fleet and
there's nobody in it and we're going to
use the like the the car hailing feature
to get it to come pick us up so what do
I do I just play I'm gonna work great
ok pick me up so I was assuming I was
gonna sit in the front but nope I just
chill here this is it this is cool so
check this out this seems to be what
does this lidar data cool so this is
actually the front end of the car that
just pulled in behind us and then these
right here this is a group of people
that's walking on so you can actually
see their their steps right now oh but I
can I can click start ride
okay cool so we can't go out on the road
on this one for legal reasons but we can
operate the car completely autonomously
here in the parking lot and my
understanding is that part of the demo
is that they're gonna try to throw the
car for a bit of a loop by having an
obstacle come out in front of us is that
correct okay you can see here in
real-time
these are updating I think it's what
what twenty times a second we're getting
this real-time readout of the shape of
the closed course that were on here and
then any obstacles so these are actually
plants that you can see along the side
here oh she's moving some tyres we
better stop yes we have detected in the
obstacle so if I were to leap out of the
car and jump in front of it right now
stop yes but don't do that processing
parking look I know everyone else is
gonna want like a natural human sounding
voice but I'm more into like full robot
car now a short drive around a closed
parking lot might seem like a pretty
underwhelming autonomous driving demo
but that's only until you have a look at
the underlying tech because none of it
was pre scripted so behind me they're
doing the the talk for this demo and
they cover a few things first and
foremost is that they're expecting this
kind of level for driving technology to
show up in their cars as early as 2021
which last I checked is not a long time
from now the other thing was the
comparison between how an autonomous
vehicle can perceive the world and how a
human can in terms of the intake of
information so they show a couple of
slides and then they take it away after
a couple seconds ago okay well how many
pedestrians were there how many cars
were there and of course you don't know
you can't remember those kinds of
details but the car does in fact BMW had
to build a new data center just how's
all the data that they're getting from
these cars the ones that are coming are
going to be generating up to eight
terabytes per hour of data to be sent
back and analyzed so that the AI can
learn
so there's two different ways the car
uses this information first is for the
the overall mission so like go to BMW
rogue for example and that's gonna tell
the car things like oh well we're gonna
need to change lanes eventually so I can
make a left turn but the part that was
really fascinating to me was the
visualization of the more immediate
intent based processing that the car is
doing it's taking everything around it
in real-time 20 times a second and
trying to predict about the next
anywhere from five to seven seconds and
there's some really cool stuff here
everything is color-coded according to
whether it's going the speed limit above
the speed limit decelerating or stopped
so red objects are stopped blue objects
are going faster than the speed limit
and pretty much everything has these
little curves or lines that are coming
out of the front so that tells us what
the car is expecting that object to do
based on a successful identification of
the object like whether it's a
motorcycle or a truck a car or whatever
the case may be now in some cases you
might see that the car isn't sure maybe
someone pulled into a left turn lane but
they didn't signal so you might get two
paths this one might go straight or it
might go left and the car will approach
with caution same thing for this bicycle
rider for example who is standing by the
side of the road looking like oh maybe
they could just keep standing there or
maybe they could fall over and follow it
into the street now there's still a lot
of training work to be done but between
their test fleet and the simulations
that they run BMW is well on their way
to the two hundred and forty million
kilometers that they are required by
their own internal quality standards to
test each model for before being able to
release it into the wild now it's time
for our second driver assist demo of the
day so this is demonstrating level two
features and while the car itself
doesn't look you know futuristic or
abnormal in fact this is a 3-series that
you could go to the lot and buy today if
you wanted the software is different so
we've actually got the developer who's
driving our car I feel pretty cool about
that and he's gonna be showing us some
of the features of what they're calling
neck
level cruise control including the
ability to automatically decelerate for
a red light set right without you
touching it assuming you did your job
assuming you did your job correctly is
that why they make you drive it yeah so
he asked us for permission to drive fast
so I apologize in advance for the camera
being a little all over the place
because I said yeah I want to have the
full experience
so unlike the level 4 demo we are
actually going out on the road for this
one is this something David look look
nice so once the light goes green it
doesn't start moving for us remember
this is not level 3 level 4 but it does
detect that and makes a little audible
tone hey wake up gotta start meeting up
so on our second light it actually
wasn't already red as we were
approaching it it was yellow but the car
started to decelerate anyway so the
fundamental difference between this kind
of driver assist technology versus
autonomous operation is that the car is
just taking a formula how fast am I
going
what status is the light and performing
a fixed action it's not actually sensing
contextual information about the
environment and making a decision that's
the key difference so I thought we were
done I thought that was the last demo
then they brought us into a theater here
for a little closing ceremony and a
last-minute surprise so this right here
is a concept bike that they're calling
the vision DC roadster and it borrows
some elements that we already saw
earlier today like for example the
recycled carbon fiber construction now
this one's really got my attention for a
couple of reasons it's fully electric
it's fully connected and BMW promises it
is 110 percent what is it they called it
pure driving pleasure something along
those lines that sounds pretty good to
me so thanks for watching guys thanks to
BMW for sponsoring our trip out here if
you guys dislike to this video you know
where that button is but if you liked it
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link below JK almost
nothing we showed today is available but
hey
in the future right vision for later
yeah that's the idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
