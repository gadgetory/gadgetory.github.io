2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair alright guys we're here at
logitech checking out the g502 proteus
core the guys said they're trying to get
away from like like model lists with the
g502 stuff so I'm gonna name it as
prettiest core from here on out really
interesting mouse really interesting
sensor especially that we haven't seen
on any other Mouse before and it this is
the only Mouse that has this sensor as
of right now and they're claiming that
is the most accurate sensor out there
with a lot of really interesting claims
like like no acceleration or like kind
of stuff well go into that adventure a
little bit more when we get this mouse
in office and are able to do and much
fuller review of it later on really
interesting other things that they have
to is though when looking at G 500 and G
500s the weighting system goes up
vertically on an angle into the mouse so
if you add weight to the mouse it
increases the center of gravity in the
most but this one it's on a kind of a
plate on the bottom so as you add weight
it's not changing the center of gravity
of the mouse but it's interesting
because I like adding weight to my mouse
I like heavy mice but I don't like
changing where the weight is in the
mouse because that kind of just feels
really weird so I like that feature as
well and another thing that they
improved on a lot is the scroll wheel I
really like the scroll wheel in G 500 g
500s they're actually my favorite scroll
wheel on any mice and that's why I like
using it on my workstation not
necessarily my games C but on my
workstation and they approved on it's
even better has even more of a tactile
feel like when you click it feels even
more metal which is really nice feels
metal but no seriously I actually do
like it a lot and it still has the Free
Spin mode which I'm a big fan of when
working on gigantic excel sheets or
viewing vertical web pages which there
are a lot more of lately especially if
you're someone who uses I can't really
name it right now for some weird reason
but the reddit enhancement suite I
believe it's called
where you can just continuously scroll
forever it's kind of nice having a
freewheeling Mouse for that you want to
