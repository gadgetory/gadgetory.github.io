high-end platform so this is the 990 FX
crosshair 5 formula within 1100 t 8 gigs
of ram a 120 gig SSD it's my usual test
platform except it has two GTX 590 s on
it so this is pretty much the fastest
gaming machine you can build on an AMD
CPU while 6990 would be pretty much
equivalent so it so it'd be an
equivalent fastest gaming machine so
what I'm going to be doing is I'm going
to be looking at once and for all which
is better for gaming AMD or Intel CPUs
at least from this generation which
won't be relevant very soon with
bulldoze are coming out and until having
a refresh coming but whatever cable so
we'll know for now so I'm going to do
the 1100 T versus the Intel Core i5 2500
K now the reason that I'm using these
two particular chips is that they are
fairly equivalently priced at this time
so there is no price to performance
ratio argument to be made really I mean
the 2500 K has to win by about 10% just
to break even
so yeah let's see how this goes this is
going to be mostly graphics bound in
spite of the fact that I'm running Quad
SLI with 5 90s because I am going to be
running fairly intensive games I may add
some more games to the test suite but
let's just see how things go and this
will be interesting I've wondered this
for a long time how do these two
platforms compare against each other in
a truly equivalent scenario oh yeah for
the Intel CPU I will be using the z68 a
GD 80 as my motherboard of choice so
I've loaded on the Intel platform now
this is a z68 platform but I will not be
using the onboard graphics at all so I'm
going to be disabling it because turning
on virtue actually will impact graphics
performance somewhat while it will
increase video encoding speed through
supported program so I'm just going for
pure graph
Fix performance for assuming this is for
a gaming system given that there are
dual GTX 590 s in it so I've finished my
1100 T results and I will be following
up now with my 2500 K results I wanted
to give you guys a little bit of info
first though so for all of these I'm
running at 2560 by 1600 and I'm going
with my usual settings so that means for
example which or two I'm not using the
very highest setting I'm using high for
example Battlefield Bad Company 2 4x
anti-aliasing 8 x AF fear 3 I had to
turn off a even though normally I use it
at 2560 by 1600 I was getting only about
12 FPS which is not enough for me to
play through my run through with the
1100 T so I'm turning off anti-aliasing
that made a big difference to
performance so we'll see how that goes
Crysis 2 I am using the shoot I can't
remember for the life of me oh yeah the
second the second highest that's right
and then dirt 3 I have it on ultra so
here we go 2500 K testing upcoming Quad
SLI is working let's see how this goes
one other thing to mention actually
mafia 2 I am using Apex physics on high
8x AF and anti-aliasing is set to on so
I'm using Nvidia cards might as well
crank up the physics alright so I have
my results with the 2500 K this is all
using these same graphical settings so
in dirt 3 we see a 12.5% increase in
performance this is about what I would
expect given the CPU costs about 10 to
12 percent more okay in Crysis 2 we see
a thirty five point five percent
difference in performance I mean sixty
two point five frames per second is
substantially more playable than forty
six point eight just due to the fact
that you're not going to see the same
dips which or two we saw just a very in
substantial increase in performance so
we're obviously not very CPU bound here
fear 3 now this one's funny I'm going to
go back I'm going to put the 1102 with
the 990 FX back on the test bench and
I'm going to run it again just to be
sure but I did run into some weirdness
on the AMD platform with fear 3 where
when I was running anti-aliasing the
performance was about a third of this it
was very very low and just turn
aw say a brought us up to here where as
on the Intel platform with with zero
times anti-aliasing I didn't see any any
weirdness in terms of performance fear 3
is not a super demanding game so even at
2560 by 1600 I was expecting more like
this number and that's what I got so
I'll rerun it just to just to see
Battlefield Bad Company 2 what is about
par for the course and then mafia 2 I'll
maybe due to the processor intensive
nature of it with all the particles and
whatnot and the CPU still has to help
out the GPU with that so we ended up
seeing a 40 approximately 40% increase
in gaming performance going to a 2500
Kay from an 1,100 tea with GTX 590 s so
let's sum you know what I'm actually
good at since I have to go for the other
platform back on anyway well maybe what
I'll do is I'll run on one more game
here just cuz it's not quite
super super late yet so I can do some a
little bit more testing for you guys so
I'm thinking maybe I'll do Lost Planet 2
yeah let's do Lost Planet 2 so I made
myself a smoothie and still at work here
so I ran Metro 2033 AM Lost Planet 2 so
Metro 2033 actually showed the 2500 K
losing this is the first time I've seen
that
and then Lost Planet 2 showed a 20%
victory for the 2500 K now tier 3 I've
put that back on fear 3 has exhibited
exactly the same behavior second time
around so the 2500 K even with 4 x
anti-aliasing still manages a better
frame rate than fear 3 on the 1100 to
you without anti-aliasing so thinking I
mean SLI supports pretty new for AMD
platform so maybe there's an issue with
the SLI driver what I think I'm going to
do well not I think I'm gonna do what
I'm going to do right now is I'm going
to take a 6800 68 7 even have a 60 years
well I do have a 68 70 but I don't have
it on me
so 69 70 there we go so I'm going to run
69 70s in fear 3 alone with the same
graphics setting 0x anti-aliasing that
single card I don't think it's going to
run that well anyway and then I'm going
to run that on both platforms and I'm
going to see if it's CPU related or if
it's related to the Quad SLI driver
alright well
seems to be a weird driver issue in
retrospect maybe I should have chosen a
more normal graphics configuration like
maybe GTX 580 SLI or something like that
I couldn't use 6970 crossfire because I
know Crysis 2 behaves very strangely
with it from some other benchmarking I
did this weekend anyway you can see here
the 1100 t with the 69 70 gets 86.2 FPS
at that setting at 2560 by 1600 with
this Yap so so that's a substantially
less powerful configuration it has like
about 1/4 the GPU processing power so
now we're going to take the 2500 K run
it with the 69 70 see how it comes out
and that is what we will take to be our
performance difference for fear 3 well
that was rather anticlimactic after all
that fear 3 is a dead tie so thank you
for checking out my coverage of the 2500
K versus the 1100 T in Quad SLI and in
fear 3 running a 69 70 don't forget to
