brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital we're here at the audio
technica booth having a bit of a holy
balls moment because they have finally
figured out that gamers around the world
are using their audiophile grade
headphones for gaming and they are kind
of I was being walked through the
logical process here and they're like
well I guess it makes sense because if
you want to hear a bunch of details and
clarity in the music you probably need
that in games as well and that is
absolutely correct that is exactly why
people are using audiophile grade
headphones for gaming now with that said
it's not always the most convenient way
to do it so they're like okay alright
fine we're going to take this we're
going to embrace it we're going to run
with it we're going to make actual
gaming headsets so this is the ath adg-1
and the ath ag-1 they're both quite
similar so they both feature their
double air dampening system which
reduces the effect of external vibration
on the sound that you're hearing they
both use their advanced engineering and
manufacturing processes that are
borrowed from the audiophile grade
headphones and then they're basically
just going okay well we can make that
stuff so let's let's put that in here
let's put you know fifty three
millimeter drivers let's make sure the
impedance is appropriate at about thirty
eight ohms so you can run this off of
your onboard sound and then let's go
ahead and take microphones which we also
happen to be quite good at and let's
tack them on so let's start with
actually we'll start with the closed
back design so the ADH art the ATH AG
one has a sort of matte black and gold
aesthetic that should be quite appealing
to gamers but not off-putting for people
who are a little bit more more serious
they've also got their 3d wing support
system so that is rather than having a
full headband I'm going to go ahead and
model these for you guys there we go
oh the mics on listen mode so anyway so
rather than having a full headband it is
meant to be no adjustments required it
just sits on your head and it should
kind of float there it's not my personal
preference but lots of people do like
them which leads us to the microphone
the microphone is on a 100 degree swivel
so you can see it goes a little up and
down like that and then this
I love these flexible sort of
repositionable things because the
problem with
any gaming headsets is that they have
these large boom mics that end up
sitting right in front of your mouth but
actually the correct positioning for
mouth is more like or for a mouth for a
microphone is more like at the corner of
your mouth so this is awesome and it
sounds absolutely fantastic they've got
a demo here where you can talk to each
other so edsel and i we're both plugged
in and standing there listening to each
other through the headphones and it is
uh it is one of the best actually it for
me it's the best microphone i've heard
on a gaming headset and i guess it
bloody well better be if it's going to
cost two hundred and fifty dollars or
three hundred dollars but then again
with that said I've heard gaming
headphones that cost that much and don't
have fantastic microphones so you can
take nothing for granted these days
let's move on to the ath ATG one so this
is the slightly more expensive one it
uses an open back design just as a
reminder the difference between a closed
back design and an open back design is
basically how much people can hear of
what you're listening to and how much
you can hear of what the people around
you are saying or doing so you've got an
aluminum mesh that's the that's the
openness rather than that plastic cover
and other than that it's quite similar
instead of the pleather ear cups we've
got cloth ear cups on this model the
same microphone technology and there's
actually something that I missed very
briefly there before and there is a mute
button on the inside of the mic right
about there now they both are able to
plug into your PC natively using a
three-and-a-half millimeter jet but they
also include a nice little handy dandy
USB DAC the one odd thing about this
product is that they're using a 4-pole
connector on the three-and-a-half
millimeter jack I understand why they're
doing it they want to be able to
natively plug into a tablet or a smart
phone for mobile gaming in fact many
ultrabooks are using them these days but
I think some people are going to be a
little bit confused when they go to plug
this directly into their sound card or
their objective 2 headphone amplifier or
other higher-end audio solution on their
PC and kind of go oh well why did they
do this
don't worry though guys there are
splitter cable cables where you can take
one for pull and go up two to three
poles so there they're available fairly
inexpensively thank you guys very much
for checking out our coverage of the ath
adg-1 and the ath ag1 Audio Technica
gaming headsets I'm extremely excited
about these I wish I could comment more
on this
quality but they just have a single demo
here running and I'm in the middle of a
crowded show floor so hopefully we'll be
able to bring you guys a review of this
sometime in the in this year guys don't
miss any of our CES 2014 coverage
remember our trip to the show is powered
by NCI XCOM your source for great
technology selection and service as well
as courser memory and Western Digital
without those guys we would not be able
to be here bringing you guys these
