had thought okay well maybe it's the
NTSC pal switch maybe it's something
else no no the problem was I had the
cartridge in backwards so the label
should be facing you not the back of the
unit so be really carefully you can tell
from the shape of the hole but you can
put it in backwards and you do still get
sound that way which is kind of crazy
I'm surprised I didn't break the
cartridge anyway here's Michael
Jackson's Moonwalker I'll turn the
speaker's up so you can kind of I hear
them sound quality is OK and I mean it's
about what you would expect but we're
starting the one player game and here we
go we are Michael and we are doing
whatever it is Michael does to get
started in the game basically the
overall the screen is fairly bright and
you can view it from I'd say anywhere
from about 30 degrees off center so it's
not too bad from that respect and you
can be Michael Jackson and the little
girl runs away from you and anyway thank
you for checking out my gameplay video
of the retro gen</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
