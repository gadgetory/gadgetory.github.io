technology of projecting images graphics
and videos over top of the real world
like in the movies and it actually
exists today but most of what we have is
pretty unimpressive because the holy
grail of AR is of course not pointing
your phone at stuff and seeing graphics
pop up through your phone's camera on
your screen that much would be obvious
to anyone who's ever tried to do that
for longer than a couple of minutes
during a stage demo the holy grail is
integrating it into something that can
be worn comfortably and ideally
discreetly but while many companies some
working privately like magic leap and
others beating a drum about it like
Microsoft are pursuing head-mounted a
are the current solutions are bulky and
very expensive a hololens will set you
back three thousand US dollars enter
scrappy upstart eyeglass these guys
claim that their display tax solves some
of the biggest issues with waveguide AR
displays and that they can do it at
one-tenth of the cost and I'm actually
about to get my first taste of their
prototype oh do you guys have PIAA yet
private Internet access the VPN if you
don't we're gonna have it linked below
go check it out there our sponsor today
before I actually try this thing though
let's do a little bit of background who
are these guys so Sam UN actually worked
at Microsoft from 2012 to 2016 on the
original hololens team as a senior
hardware engineer so obviously he
believes in AR and even hololens to some
degree it's an amazing piece of
technology that uses cameras to track
the environment around the user letting
him or her interact with the digital
content the problem with it though is
that the screen is relatively small with
about a 32 degree horizontal field of
view not to mention that the color is
inaccurate white in particular is very
difficult to display and the waveguide
type displays that are built into the
lenses in front of each eye are about
$2,000 total that is 2/3 of the total
cost of the base model on the two
displays alone so by contrast eyeglass
believes that bare tech could get closer
to about $10 per eye or 20 bucks 1% of
the cost which would make it easier to
build an affordable device around it so
it uses what's called off-axis imaging
instead of putting a light source
perpendicular to your eye so you're
you're looking into a display directly
with a backlight behind it it actually
puts the display and the backlight above
the eye so you can actually see that if
I flip it up like this and then it
reflects it off a curved piece of glass
this makes it see-through kind of like
if you were wearing sunglasses which
means that you can see the world around
you it also gives you a field of view
that is only limited by the size of the
lenses so our prototype here apparently
offers an 80 degree field of view and it
can use either a normal LCD display or
even an OLED display or I mean who knows
I guess the future display technology's
not out of a question ok so this is the
part where I finally get to put it on
and sounds gonna kind of help me with
the demo here so just a normal velcro
strap
it's very 3d printed at this point guys
so we need to be very careful with it
okay so it looks like the image is
probably about I'd say about ten feet in
front of me right now so now when I have
content running on it
it is obviously a harder to see through
it but like I can read my teleprompter
right now I can interact with pehle
but if I focus on that image that's
about twelve feet in front of me things
start to kind of fade away so without
anything running on it
it's about as dark as I'd say my my
pretty dark sunglasses it's kind of
weird it doesn't because it's like
sitting so close to your eyes it doesn't
feel like there's two lenses in front of
you so right now I can really see the
curvature of the glass like I can see a
curve to the top of it a curve to the
bottom and then it gets kind of like the
shape gets kind of cut off here but
what's an explained is that really any
technology any display technology that
relies on a curved piece of glass is
going to need processing done ahead of
time to kind of pre distort the image so
that it ends up having those nice those
square corners that you would expect
blacks and really dark colors are a
little bit tough because those are
obviously the display to the best of its
ability being off meaning that you see
right through it
but white is actually surprisingly
opaque I mean these are the same
challenges that you run into with
something like a projector for example
that's why a darkroom would be ideal I
mean trying this in the dark that would
be trippy actually can we kill the
lights
now that is really cool like if I was on
a nighttime flight or something in a
dark environment like I could be
convinced I'm looking at a really nice
projector so there's no reason then that
you couldn't have effectively like a
ceiling mounted giant display so
you guys are quoting this at what about
120 inches at 12 feet ish right
osa is probably twice or even even
higher Sansa typically out device in
term of angular resolution right so I
did guess right it is 1080p per eye but
we're stretching it over a relatively
small area compared to a VR headset so
it actually looks pretty fine and it
should be noted that eyeglass has no
intention of turning this prototype into
a fully functional AR headset what
they're really focused on is developing
the core technology which is projecting
the display into the viewers eyes so
like on the business side you guys are
more looking for partners to take this
display tech and then use whatever
resolution they want and maybe external
tracking cameras if they're into that
right or whatever you guys don't care
yes you're focused on these displays up
here the curvature of the lens and then
all the software that goes along with
that right
one thing I'm also noticing sitting here
and using this is that compared to VR
even though the image is moving around
it's more like a yeah it's more like a
virtual screen sitting in front that
loser like I'm not getting motion sick
right why is that because you can see
this so it's another trick of the brain
that's helping with motion sickness now
you get the best experience actually
when even like you stabilize your head
on something and the screen is very
still because otherwise it's it's pretty
easy to get distracted by things the
real world moving behind it but whenever
you do move you do lose that immersion
for a little bit like it's it's not as
immersive as VR and I don't I don't
foresee a future where it ever would be
but even though you lose that immersion
a little bit this serves a purpose
because it also allows your brain in
your eyes to work together to see the
objects that are fixed around you and
keep you from getting disoriented
so so this is a purely 3d printed serves
no purpose other than to try the display
tank
thing in order for me to see the content
I have to get about here yeah like if
you were watching porn right now I
wouldn't know until probably about here
that there's like naked bodies that's
definitely breasts yeah so from there
yes but if I'm any further away I would
have to be about here but right now what
you're watching at work there wow it
looks like she's wearing like part of a
trash bag well it's better than the
whole trash bag pretty neat though hey
actually surprisingly good so I have to
get to see what you're watching I have
to get about here Colton you wanna try
it
it's a are interesting okay like it's
like a good image - yeah it's a video so
yeah wow I can actually see the screen
like really well so you could be working
while you watch the Victoria's Secret
oh this is perfect show that's awesome
hey I'm banning these these aren't
allowed no it's really cool like I do
like the image quality like even
compared to something like a goodbye
it's Prince kids yeah so the way that
they envision people using this is
mobile entertainment so you have privacy
because nobody can see what you're
watching unless they got like right
under by your chin and looked up at your
displays the ability to have a bigger
screen for entertainment on like a train
or a bus or the plane so this would be
an alternative to listening to podcasts
for example before see a use case where
you could walk
on the street playing games or watching
youtube videos but then without your
head either buried in a phone or I mean
much more danger I've never seen anyone
doing this but inside a VR headset I
would be super stupid or even just doing
chores around the house like watching a
movie while you vacuum I do have to say
I haven't personally witnessed the
demand for these use cases yet in all my
travels I have yet to see someone using
a VR headset on a plane so they did some
studies internally asking people in a
double-blind comparison to rate their
experience in VR AR and they said that
most people preferred AR but I do wonder
is that a purely academic question since
I haven't yet seen people using either I
would like to hear your feedback if you
could have a 120 inch screen in a device
this size that you could carry around
with you would you use it and speaking
of things that you might use ting does
mobile phone service differently there's
no contracts no overage fees or any
other carrier nonsense you just pay a
fair price for the talk text and data
that you end up using each month and
with ting if you use less you pay less
for example if you're often around Wi-Fi
why are you paying for a set monthly
data plan ting gives you complete
control over your cellphone account so
you can set alerts and caps for each
device on your account to keep your
users in check and you can even disable
texting calling or mobile data entirely
if you wish
nationwide LTE coverage means you'll
have great network coverage from coast
to coast and almost any phone will work
with ting starting with your ancient
Motorola RAZR that you've got sitting in
your basement for some reason all the
way up to the latest galaxy s 9 or
iPhone 10 so check your phone's
compatibility right now that line is
2018 dot ting comm and when you go there
you can get 25 bucks off your bill or
towards a new phone in the ting shop so
thanks for watching guys if this video
sucked you know what to do
