show for you guys today which is good
because we're you guys have been waiting
so very long for it to start
not the YouTube audience um we've got a
special guest with us here he can't get
his webcam working but quite frankly
that was the least of the issues we had
today so Kyle from bit wit say hi Kyle
yeah our powers combined yeah yeah late
squared oh my god we should do coop
shows called late summer
apparently they can't hear you what wait
you're not coming through on the discord
your mic is muted on discord unmute
yourself on discord unmute yourself on
discord John there we go oh oh man okay
okay oh I'm breathing I'm breathing now
okay whew
so yes Kyle Kyle is here trust me he's
here we have topics
topic number one is that Kyle is the
first person the first creator for the
floatplane platform oh my gosh of all
time except for Linus tech tips yeah
okay oh yeah yeah she's number two
[Laughter]
in other news Nvidia teases another
Titan X the collector's edition we
needed this
in other news next-gen AMD epic could be
equipped with an epic 64 course we also
needed that and in other news razer
announced a phone for gamers we needed
that too i am going to roll the intro
but we really needed is wow classic
servers no I'm officially on blizzard
I'm really
oops I knew he was so excited okay okay
it's weird because I can't say
battle.net anymore because that's not
what it is
it's Blizzard app it's so stupid no
that's terrible the launcher thing no
I'm not right now but are people
actually following suit and calling it
that or are people just like no fuck
that I'm still calling about that I
think I probably like no screw in battle
tent I think I think mostly people are
saying the battlenet but I don't really
know no intro music by the way yeah I
don't know how happen cuz I like legit
did not change that at all post the
YouTube video no I haven't oh yeah yeah
I published it video we're good we're
good we're good
realize okay so apparently it's now
Blizzard battlenet they changed it again
that's terrible and they should feel -
the only the only entity to change their
name okay okay so I know you said you
have to go at five well so much for that
so do you want to talk about some other
stuff because I'm sure you'd love to
talk classic Wow NVIDIA Titan
collector's edition actually there's a
lot of really great stuff today so you
want to have some topics with us first
or you want to jump into floatplane what
do you want to do it's up to you we've
wasted enough of your time
yes it's totally your guys's call I mean
I guess we can start with the floatplane
stuff okay that's news okay cool let's
do it yeah
so Kyle is the first person to join
floatplane and he is having the
pre-alpha experience that is for sure
how's it going so far there it's it's it
totally is pre-alpha man okay I feel
like I feel like jumping in like that's
the first it's almost like I'm the first
woman that any man has ever seen oh my
god there's what is that we've never
seen one of these before
I'm just getting like royal treatment
it's it's so good super cool and
everyone's incredibly nice you know like
when I first went in there and I was
like interacting with people and like
saying oh thanks I was like replying to
everyone individually and some guy was
like you know kindly was like hey you
know like glad you're here but by the
way you can use like the multi multi
quote yeah yeah yeah sure and then like
I actually tried it I was like yeah like
what do you think of my first multi
quote how did I do and he's like well
you only quoted me so it's hard to say I
feel like my grandpa super kind okay
that's really cool that's great okay so
basically right now the way that it
works I'm just gonna I'm just gonna fire
up the store here is if you go to this
so okay our plan was actually not to
bring on other creators Luke just hasn't
slept a lot in the past week in the last
year to be fair no one on the floatplane
team really has so because the plan for
floatplane was to bring other creators
on some time off
Derr linus media group properties had
been live on the new site for some time
yo yeah so like like a mile from yeah so
like potentially other creators were
still four to six months out in terms of
a realistic timeline it was like okay
yeah you read the premature the first
one big trial yeah so basically I think
you can partially blame YouTube for that
right yes all the pay channels as of two
days ago and as far as I know I'm like
one of the only if not the only tech
youtuber that actually had a paid
channel on youtubes platform so yeah I
was really the only one to seemingly get
affected by it and then that's when you
guys were like hey like speaking of
which we've got but we but we're working
on an alternative so so how long were
you running bit with ultra as a paid
channel through YouTube before they just
like candidate which lines up if you
like YouTube yeah I feel like YouTube
yeah it definitely lines up with like
how YouTube works cuz they like to like
work you up and be like hey look at all
these new features and things we added
and then like it's congratulations it's
your one-year anniversary we're shutting
it down so I guess like it just kind of
happened out of nowhere but yeah it's
been it's been going for about a year
now I launched a bit with ultra which
was basically early access at free
content both on youtube and patreon
simultaneously because there was a huge
a huge group of people who weren't able
to view paid channels on YouTube
countries are supported there so it was
a huge huge just sort of ordeal I was
thinking oh you know it's not bad
uploading all my content to a second
channel that's that's not too much work
and then I find out that I have to
upload it to a third channel now because
patreon doesn't actually have a native
uploader so I actually had to upload I
had to create a third YouTube channel
upload all my early access content there
I have it unlisted and then link it to
patreon it was just like so okay for the
result there for the viewers out there
that are sitting there going well gee
why why are you an idiot why didn't you
just upload the video to your bit wit
channel unlisted a week early and then
give that to the patreon people and then
just set it public and hold on no no
there's a legitimate reason for this
whether Kyle himself is actually aware
of it or not I'm not sure but there's a
real reason for this and we've observed
that algorithmically YouTube doesn't
entirely
forget and I'm using finger quotes for
forget because YouTube is a not a
sentient being
although yeah so we did so far it is a
machine and YouTube doesn't sorry Nick
was doing the stairs behind us he was
walking down the stairs behind the show
and he's like she's like still in like
20% of the frame so YouTube doesn't
entirely forget the upload date yeah
when it does it's machine learning
nonsense about you know sending out your
video to people so what's weird is like
you'll upload something a week early
let's say and you'll set it public and
the public like the date you see for the
video upload
externally is the date you made it
public but the date you see internally
in your CMS is the date you uploaded it
YouTube still knows and what we've
observed is that leaving something
sitting on the channel for some time
actually causes it to kind of rot yeah
and not only just that but if you upload
something unlisted with the same name
thumbnail and actual video content and
then release another one that second one
will also get tanked so
exactly why a lot of people wondering
like a lot of my vulture subscribers -
when it was still on YouTube they were
like why are you uploading the same
video but with a different title and
thumbnail yes because I was noticing as
I was getting you know getting situated
with with this new model and stuff is
that like my tea by the knee of Mike you
can't just sort of the tank with all
these videos that were getting
reuploaded you know essentially on a
different channel but still using the
same metadata and things like that and
yeah I noticed that there was sort of an
uptick once I started switching up the
thumbnails and then I was like this
becomes even more work to be clearer to
the viewers out there you know youtubers
as a whole are not like complaining
about the hard work that we do to you
know come up with a different title for
the video the second time we upload it
or whatever it's just one of those
things where the honestly where it
really runs into a lot of work for us is
when there's all these little different
moving parts that we have to get
synchronized and then something's wrong
and you have to like bail on a family
dinner and go figure out what's going on
and which one you forgot and it's just
having a bunch of different moving parts
when you go to publish a video it's just
kind of a pain in the butt and it can
also be more difficult than people
realize to actually come up with two
good thumbnails and two good titles for
the same video it's hard enough to find
one really effective thumbnail title let
alone to where like it's actually really
good and eye catching and grabby but
also doesn't piss off your audience for
being clickbait it's it's a yeah but you
got to find that fine line and if I
think two things on the fine line can
boy boy is that ever a balancing act
Oh
[Laughter]
one of my favorite things is that this
whole page channels going down thing is
on the exact to the day one-year
anniversary of vessel going down did you
know yeah November first notice I
tweeted about it and everything November
first was one was when vessel went down
and November first was when YouTube paid
channels went down and so on the
anniversary of vessel going down pay
channels went down and Kyle joined flow
point huh and it's also I mean because
floatplane started almost to the day
when vessel went yeah cuz those two
those two events were somewhat related
let's say yeah that's also the
anniversary of a floatplane development
actually starting not quite to the day
but like a few days early that's a
little bit of a strong it's gray it's
right well because there's also
different stages just like at the very
beginning we're like we put videos on
forum you download really now there's
like streaming can I tease things later
can we talk about it a little bit it's
so janky right I know but can we just
can we just show some of the sure let's
let's just do it okay so first first I'm
gonna show the way that it actually
works so Kyle and I talked about this
last night one of the things that
floatplane strives to do judges and the
other guy that I don't know if is able
to be public are gonna slap me we'll
figure this out we'll figure this out so
uh so so Kyle and I were talking last
night one of the things that flow plane
really wants to do is work with the
creators on what's gonna work best for
the platform and since Kyle joined one
of the biggest pieces of feedback we've
gotten from viewers has been like yo
right now it's three dollars for Linus
Media Group and it's three dollars for
bit with it would be great if we could
combine those and
do like a combo purchase and so I had a
call of Kyle we talked it through last
night I talked to Luke today and
basically the conclusion that we came to
is that if we were to offer a discount
we are either going to be like what it's
going to turn into is it's going to turn
into trying to build a video platform as
opposed to trying to build a tool for
individual creators to use and that
wasn't really the point of the platform
in the first place so we crunch some
numbers and we figured out okay well
what if the floatplane platform itself
could just make some pie-in-the-sky
assumptions about bandwidth usage being
significantly lower for one person
subscribe to ten creators versus ten
people subscribe to one creator and we
could just kind of absorb that out of
there and what we ended up with was a
discount level that would frankly look
kind of insulting yeah and what we also
ended up with was a fundamental change
to the model that we didn't really like
so for us we want to make sure that
we're operating with a safe amount of
margin to keep the platform sustainable
because we don't want to go down on
November 1st 2018 really and the other
thing is that if we have extra we have
no problem giving it back but for us
it's a creator first platform and we'd
love to do things like in kyla this is
probably the first time you're hearing
about this but one of the things that
I'd like to do is take all of the
floatplane margin that's coming in from
your first couple of months here and
then dump that into some promoted posts
on Facebook and stuff like that to see
if we can drive in more subscribers so
that's the kind of thing that we'd
rather do yeah versus just you know
discount a bundle of three creators by
like $1 so we want to make sure that any
money that's coming in is going to
supporting the creators on the platform
so I think we've pretty much made a
final decision there we're not gonna
offer bundles because it would really
either hamper the choice of creators in
terms of the types of bundles that they
want to offer consumers or would hamper
our ability to properly develop and
support the creators and
the platform so there you go there's
that now let's jump into some stuff that
nobody has really seen before oh geez
okay okay actually one one more thing
this won't give that only time that I
pimped this but it is in our best
interest now for the first time ever to
drive subscriptions to another creator
which is weird this is like this is like
a weird awkward position for me so I'm
posting some links right now tell me the
awkward if you want it to be right now
you actually access bit wit through the
LTTE forum so I'm gonna show you guys
how that looks oh I hope I still have
not gotten used in your anytime I like
logging like vlog it logging the Linus
tech tips and like we'll go to the store
I see floatplane and I just see like my
logo like okay they're getting ddos
right what's happening no yeah no it's
not it's not it's not an error that is a
bit wit logo on Linus tech tips calm
super bizarre so once you're subscribed
what happens is you'll see this
floatplane section at the top of the
forum and then you'll be able to go to
bit with ultra and you will find ok so
right now which which ones are early
access right now videos yeah so let's
see I think there's the announcement
well actually right now there are no
really access videos as far as like a
week early there's just one that can you
tell me what's coming yes I can actually
the H 700 I from NZXT the new case oh
cool 200 freakin dollars that's that's
gonna be going up very soon
there's there's other stuff there's
there's more good stuff coming soon
that's fine that's a good enough sales
pitch don't worry about it
yeah yeah it's totally great plus it'll
look way better than it doesn't you yeah
yeah dog yeah and the secret to that is
what just like higher bitrate because a
lot of people in the forum where we're
saying that the 720 on your for more on
flow plane really is looking better and
crispier than 1080p on YouTube yeah so
it's it's more nuanced than that there's
like how you transcode it to be able to
get more quality and a lower amount of
bitrate and all this kind of jazz but
yeah there's some there's some special
sauce going on it does look really good
yeah I don't even have to use my nice
camera and use my phone it's like all my
good stuff it's actually kind of like
what I've seen a pretty common
comparison for and this is not from me
is that it's one step up kind of so 720
on ours looks sort of like 1080 on
YouTube 1080 on ours looks sort of like
4k on YouTube yeah we haven't we have we
are getting way ahead of ourselves here
okay the last for the last time I'm
gonna get ahead of ourselves today is to
show you guys what the site will not
look like Oh effectively because it's
gonna be pretty different from this
right sort of oh okay so it's not that
was gonna be that different oh okay okay
cool I never mind I thought I was
looking at an old version okay the blue
top bar is gone okay if you click on an
individual channel like if you click on
tech quickie you can see how the top bar
being gone affects it more there you go
yes okay okay cool okay so Kyle you may
actually be seen oh you've seen this cuz
you can log into it so right now
registration is closed you can't log
into the site yeah stop it but we are
showing for the first time what
floatplane may or may not end up looking
like yeah there's definitely going to be
changes we're obviously not gonna have a
giant Razer logo and yeah no that's just
a random placeholder image app but there
will be channel banners like this videos
are going to be basically the star of
the show
it's gonna be layout differences though
there will be layout differences and
this is the videos tab so this actually
might look pretty exactly how it does
now but there's probably gonna be a Home
tab that looks different right now it's
full of placeholder garbage like we make
videos and stuff cool eh you should
probably check out - cat tips who put
that there
I I think I think that was - 4-cyl okay
brilliant so here's what playlists may
or may not end up looking like
everything is very different yeah it's a
different idea for those how close to
the comments section is this gonna be
women hey here's a comment post so there
you go guys there's a comment Wow in
real time it says how many seconds ago
it was dislike okay that's probably not
gonna continue you think real-time
comment counters no probably not
that would bury us oh wow Wow
so here's some you know other videos
from this particular creator so these
aren't hooked into the backend so we
can't put you right now but that's
that's not a huge deal are we planning
to have the video stay playable at the
top as we scroll through the comments
yeah so it's gonna stay fixed and you'll
keep scrolling and this pretty sweetles
go yeah yeah so like major things that
need to work on right now is being able
to do payment stuff yeah
account creation is doing pretty okay
we're working on connected accounts so
that you guys can log in with your forum
accounts that you already have for a bit
with ultra and LMG floatplane and we'll
have access to the things that you've
already paid for on the new sites you
don't need to do anything and then we'll
just incentivize changing over payment
platforms because honestly the one run
right now is terrible super terrible and
you should be on the new one but we're
gonna like try to have some incentives
so they don't want to be on the new one
too and there's yeah there's there's
there's definitely more stuff to do on
the site but that's sort of how it will
look
no like crazy major changes outside of
that
oh you're not streaming this okay no no
I was like all right we're showing that
okay I mean we can we can show we could
show how alpha it is hey Kyle do you
think we should show them the Alpha ness
of the CMS alpha beta alpha beta okay
we're gonna do it so I show the settings
page to do it sure yeah the settings
none and none of the other tabs work
subscriptions unavailable notifications
well nothing right uh see no super
private oh yeah yeah tons of secure
literally all the security through
obscurity this is what yeah all right so
here's where you put in the description
totally non-functional but it will
eventually this is a bug yeah so this is
a bug this is a video that I was trying
to upload like yesterday and you know
it's stuck here now it's just stuck and
I can't you can't actually do anything
scheduled change thing isn't isn't
supposed to work yeah I know okay we got
an edit button for videos that are
uploaded you can actually edit them like
there's no Save button
oh you can save the changes on changing
the thumbnail so you know oh look I'm
not I'm not giving you tore it up for
like a day the point of this there's
been some really good development that
has happened okay
okay no there is actual so most of the
work over the last year has been
back-end work there's been a well
infrastructure there's been a lot of
infrastructure work that's happening
because guys like we are all about dead
back-end so check this out
this should be a much more impressive
demo this is Kyle's of GTX 1070 TI video
click what's Gregan people doing well
today's video is going to be a very
perfectly thrown together because I'm
short on time what else do I know
so Paul you're in advance for that but I
still think the data you're gonna be
seeing today is going to excite that how
that's gonna go down dude
I just want to check with you yeah okay
negatory okay that's good that's good by
the way I love your profile picture I
think Brandon actually tweeted me like
this is by far the best video clip that
you will ever produce in your life now
you just need to get like multiple
versions of like alcohol things and have
all of them hit you in the eye at the
same time it's like sort of like a
cartoon or animated version of that
screenshot and it says beware of
bottlenecks oh that's pretty that's not
bad like that that's not bad huh
I wouldn't buy one but if you sent it to
me for free I might consider wearing it
how about that yeah you should but you
should wear it because I feel
self-conscious wearing a shirt with my
face
[Laughter]
oh man so anyway there you guys go
I'm gonna go ahead and I'll link the
store one more time here I'll link
specifically the join bit wit ultra one
go check it out so you're doing one week
early access and I think you had also
promised streaming even though Luke and
I were pretty clear that streaming
doesn't work yet but that's the last
thing that I think Luke wants to update
you on live what you guys have been
doing some testing yeah so we've we've
done we've done some testing yeah it's
been going okay there's still a lot of
work that needs to be done we're gonna
be working on it tonight my little
after-party Stream is going to be
streamed to twitch and our own
infrastructure which is crazy and we're
gonna see how that goes and do some
stress testing
AJ was doing testing from like uploading
to a server in Quebec yeah and then
having that go over to the EU and then
watching that stream off of an EU edge
server that was like actually doing
pretty well we need to get
multi-resolution working we need to get
a live chat we need connected accounts
working so that people can use their
accounts to actually talk in the live
chat there's a bunch of work that still
needs to be done but yeah it's coming
along
alright do you guys want to do some
actual tech news I mean this wise tech
and it was news alright so this was
originally posted by max settings on the
forum and the original article is this
YouTube video from NV
because I think the audience actually
has sound off my laptop this week so one
moment here
um it was red and green yeah so it's
probably RGB oh yeah no no it's not
nvidia is not releasing a red graphics
card mmm
so they released a teaser this morning
for the new titan x collector's edition
no mention of specs it does look like a
new cooler design with more lighting
with a green light clearly eliminating
the vapor chamber and heatsink fin array
lighting may be customizable because in
a couple frames there's a second glowing
red graphics card and it also seems like
the fan could stick out from the frame
with its own acrylic element the
scuttlebutt is that they could announce
it at CES 2018 considering it has a
scheduled keynote at the show I usually
doubt they would tease it two months
ahead of time it must be coming sooner
than that yeah I don't know Kyle does
the world need another Titan so what we
have the Titan X the Titan X Pascal the
Titan XP and the Titan X collector's
edition like I think it's stupid but I
also don't care like if someone wants to
buy it sure go ahead
I don't know no one knows ok it might it
might just be like an updated shroud I
mean it is possibly an RGB it's possible
that this is volta based wait it says
tight next not Titan XP though yeah but
like I think doesn't have yeah 13 second
video looks like gliding could be
customizable yeah there's that we don't
really know anything I don't like it is
it is possible that this could be Volta
based I mean NVIDIA has had obviously
working Volta Hardware for months now
and just because AMD hasn't given them
any compelling reason to release a
better product within the price segments
where they compete with them
here's there's the real question - is
the lighting RGB it looks like it might
attic Li yeah but but I don't see how
that's the real question
I'm trying to talk well-known
architecture might matter a lot see the
thing is I don't know if people care
about architecture anymore as long as
you've got lighting there's two fans for
a hundred dollars that are selling what
yeah to fan package the light loops are
a hundred dollars the two fans
originally ones actually do you have
that to get the light they're node Pro
whatever the lighting note pro which
okay makes you do pretty effects and
stuff but it's still two fans for a
hundred dollars I bought it like last
week in the de video on on floatplane
you bought it it's a good one it's on
full plane yeah he did I've got it yeah
does Corsair not like you know they do
it was I wasn't planning to do any
coverage on it and then impromptu I was
like I need a video idea I'm not planned
out like fire in York so I was like I
don't want to wait for Corsair to ship
it and stuff so I'll just buy it and
pick it up the same day or whatever and
did you get some sticker shock there
what did you I mean did you exceed you
know it was gonna be a hundred dollars
before you were like oh cool I did fans
I hated and I thought that's what made
it an interesting video cuz it was to
fans for a hundred dollars like we'll
check a mountains what's the deal it is
genuinely really good video I'm not
gonna lie I'm not gonna say why I did
this but I've seen it like six times or
seven times
I can probably quote your video I spent
a benjamin c tempered-glass RGB video
yeah I actually didn't see that one yet
it's like it's funny because it's like
one of those like it's funny but also
kind of sad because it's true thank you
I have I have played up the the RGB
enthusiasm and all that like I've had a
lot of fun with it and I've played both
sides of the character I've played the
the one who tries to build the anti RGB
computer by literally painting an entire
computer including the components black
killing the motherboard in the process
not a popular video not a fine moment
for the channel all the way to building
the ultimate RGB PC including me wearing
RGB shoes for the build like we've we've
gone to both ends of the spectrum here
and I have to I have to confess though
that I like RGB like in the sense that
like I think it's cute and I think it's
cool yeah but I have a Corsair k70 RGB
like their first RGB keyboard on my desk
at home and the thing about that
particular RGB keyboard is that it
defaults back to its red except for
white on WASD and the arrows color
scheme every time you like unplug it or
like don't install the driver or
whatever so there were a couple times
where I like bothered to set it up yeah
and then I got tired of it and for well
over a year it's been red with white
WASD because I just can't be arsed well
I feel like I feel like with keyboards
it's a little different because there's
literally like over a hundred little
things that you can configure and
customize right it's like it's like
sensory overload but I feel like if it's
just more straightforward it's like okay
here's a headset or a motherboard you're
not gonna have that many variations of
what you can really do with it and most
people like you like you said like most
people are gonna set it and forget it
right like okay like this profile I'm
gonna keep it just set it this way and
it's that way for like the next 18
months or whatever it is so I don't know
but at the same time like I've gotten
spoiled by RGB like I think I realized I
real
because I had the first generation of
the k70 RGB as well yeah and I was like
this is stupid I'm not gonna pay X
amount for just having this lighting and
you can change colors and stuff this is
dumb and then like the more updated like
the next generation came out and I was
like wow like the lighting so much
brighter and it looks so much better
I'm like why doesn't my stupid first
generation born great vibrant RGB
lighting it I was like oh my god oh my
god oh my god I'm caring to Kevin so
much that you want premium RGB I wish I
would like be like intellectually I know
it's dumb and gimmicky and stupid but
like my eyes just like give me Mom the
funny thing is like I think the PC
enthusiast takes a lot of flag for
caring about RGB lighting but then for
some reason actually no we do make fun
of car enthusiasts for there's big
spoilers nevermind okay forget it but
the point that I think the point the
point I was trying to make died before I
I was so excited for her he's like
rotting flesh that Wow
back when like the ducky RGB was coming
ducky shine yeah yeah I was so excited
and then like we got some in at work I
got to see the Corsair one early at CES
and all this kind of stuff and right
when I saw it I was like oh I don't know
if I care and then have never cared my
personal keyboard at home doesn't even
have lights I'm just like nope and even
if it did I have key caps that cover
them and I would not swap up my key caps
because I prefer my PBT ninja printed
gold Loki caps way over any lighter like
if I didn't have if I had it like a
keyboard that didn't have our GB I
prefer to have zero lighting whatsoever
it I think it's just when you give me
one option that's when I want more but
if you like bail options and it's not
lit up at all it'll be like oh it's
perfectly fine but give me a keyboard
that's just like oh you can only be read
for I'm like well why not green
red and green like this is almost like
one of those coexist bumper stickers on
my keyboard yeah speaking of green on
this next next topic so we'll do one
more topic then we'll do our sponsors
and then you can bail if you want or you
can sit through the sponsors if you're
not too bored by them speaking of green
the raiser phone officially announced
scrappy easy dog posted on the forum
Kyle have you seen this you heard about
this razor phone phone for gamers since
for gamers
yep say watch anyone elses video but
yeah alright so thoughts hit me okay
actually you know what Luke you look
like you have something to say you look
like you want to go first on the show
that I never let you talk I do look like
you need to talk right now I was just
gonna say like what are people playing
on it because I the first thing that
jumped in my mind was like Oh clash of
clans and you don't need a gaming phone
to play clash of clans but then also
right after I said that like come on now
you don't need this you need eight gigs
to like build a castle in eighteen
months like no it's fine but then I was
at twitchcon the entire time that I was
at twitchcon be like biggest most
ridiculous booth was lineage to which
blew my frickin mind cuz I played that
like before Wow came out and I'm like
why are you - yeah what the heck exactly
like that game from way before I I just
assumed you were talking about something
else entirely
no but it's called like ascension or
something and it's a mobile game and
it's like arena combat I have no idea
how all of this came together but it was
it was an MMO I know I don't all I saw
was arena combat it might have just been
the PvP portion I'm not sure but it's
called lineage 2 and then something and
it's this crazy phone game and there's
graphics all over the place and stuff so
maybe people over the place that like
decide that they need to play a pvp MMO
on their phone
and like if they're targeting on the
right audience yeah I know I know that's
the thing and if they're targeting the
right audience
apparently this lineage to game is like
top grossing in South Korea and Japan
Wow
and like they had day nine on stage the
entire event and had Conan O'Brien up on
stage with him at one point in time like
at twitchcon live on stage so they got
money Conan O'Brien he's like still
relevant to like that must have been a
million dollars a lot of money remember
if there's a difference between okay
this so I love dinner well you do Kranz
brings in every day yeah yeah late Wow
yeah like that was that's a weekend the
second I noticed that day nine was on
stage all the time I was like that's
really expensive and they out of nowhere
on I think Saturday quran's just up on
stage with them and I'm like that's I
don't care at all yeah cuz like here's
the thing like internet famous people
have like appearance fees like I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna lie like if if
someone is like yeah we really really
need you to be there I'm like well like
I have to travel I'm away from home I'm
away from the office yeah I'm working so
they cost money but like my
understanding is that for like a slash
b-list celebrities like Conan's a big
dude who are relevant like just to like
talk it's like a million bucks
okay yeah potentially really yes
I don't know either way just like have a
person gyro booth and it was weird cuz
you what you're at this booth and
everyone's extremely seen that they
can't see me everyone's extremely
seriously up on stage like game face
this whole teamers that'll team on their
phones and I'm like what that wow what
is this
so like apparently there's a market for
it okay
and razors from where a Singapore yeah
so they're pretty close to where that
game is grossing really highly so yep
okay so why don't we run I'll run
through the quick specs and then let's
hear your thoughts Kyle 5.7 inch 1440p
sharp display
120 Hertz that's a big deal like
obviously I'm not going to poopoo them
about that because I made a huge deal of
the IP of the latest iPad pro having a
120 her this is a variable refresh rate
display huge deal big fan I love it I
love this move some people in my stream
chat when I was talking about this while
they were doing it we're like oh that's
stupid because 120 Hertz just a waste of
battery no it's variable refresh rate so
it refreshes when it needs to so you
could turn it down you could save the
power or you could turn it up you could
have a butter smooth experience that's
10 games it'll try to crank up and then
you're like the home screen yeah it's
not going to love this use exactly and
them and the batteries pretty massive
4000 million power battery so they're
saying seven hours of gaming
continuously eight gigs of RAM 64 gigs
storage with expansion stereo
front-facing speakers with Dolby Atmos
though I'm not especially convinced that
Dolby Atmos has a ton of value when you
have a stereo speaker configuration do
you know I'm not sure Snapdragon 835 and
they're saying because of their cooling
it's the best performing Snapdragon 835
on the market how thick is the phone
it's it's not thin but it's not like a
completely ridiculous brick either it's
not that it's not that far off what I
would consider reasonable no 700 bucks
no headphone jack okay Kyle go headphone
jack yay or nay honestly it's it's it's
one of those things where I have just
like every phone that I've ever had even
like a super crappy headphone jack so
psychologically it weirds me out to
think about using a phone daily that
doesn't have one but when I think about
it realistically in the last like six to
12 months with my Google pixel first
generation like I have probably used
that jack once no so basically yeah and
that's why it's a never-ending
discussion is because it really just
boils down to the end you are you
someone who uses a wired headlight wired
headphones or earbuds with your phone
you know and I typically don't you know
I
music I am either on my desktop and I've
got you know my my cans there or I'm in
the car and and I'm using bluetooth so
for me it's it's one of those things
that I could live without it's nice to
have but it's not necessary for me
personally but I completely understand
how some people value that sort of thing
especially like you know when you get on
to the audiophile spectrum and you know
you're having phones like the what's
LG's latest one with no 30 back in it
yep yeah the V 30 and so I mean yeah I
get it I get it you know pushing it
forward and stuff like for me personally
I it's something that I could do without
assuming that the rest of the phone is
exactly what I'm looking for especially
with certain mobile gaming titles coming
out with like the voice chat and stuff
built-in yeah like the the need to be on
headphones actually sounds pretty major
and I know there's a big battery but
they're talking about a gaming phone I
know they say seven hours that's gonna
go down yeah if your headset that goes
down - yeah and that's gonna go down
over usage of the phone as well yeah and
how are you loaded up with stuff you add
voice chat in that's more things that
need to be process like I'm using my
headphone jack right now yeah - listen
to you Kyle so you might say I'm not
really said are you really sad Kate Wow
but listen it's it's one of those things
where you're really not gonna care much
or you're gonna be like desperately in
need of it there's I feel like there's
zero gray area here with that said I
have I have gotten used to not having a
headphone jack mostly well because I've
been working on my pixel to review I was
working on my review of the iPhone 8 and
the 8 plus there's at least one other
yeah I was working on my review of the
Xiaomi me mix - and these are all phones
that don't have headphone jacks and I'm
just used to now carrying around this
weird stupid multi dongle adapter thing
that I built myself so that I just have
something on hand at home tied shut up I
didn't know he strapped it all together
yeah because this way it made your own
multi game so I can run this one through
here and then the whole world oh wow
actually this was not my idea this was
this came with the Moto z-force
okay and I liberated it and then I
included I came up with the idea of
putting multiple adapters on it that's
all that I contributed to this I tried
to find one to buy because I was like I
should get some spares of these yeah and
I couldn't I don't even know what to
search for an Amazon yeah like the
dongle the dongle holder
dongle holder headphone adapter pro
waterproof we should do it as like an LT
team merch item yeah that'd be cool it's
like get like five thousand of them
maybe like yep yeah we invented this
like Kyle's fidget spinner we invented
this out of Motorola's included
accessories did you really do a fidget
spinner you're a monster yeah yeah yeah
but you know what I haven't replenished
them as soon as they sold out that was
that was the only stock because that's
literally about how long that that would
have been pretty risky yeah oh yeah all
right so there you go raise your phone
I had a lot of people I don't know hold
up I don't know where people are getting
this from there's some people in chat be
like this is so annoying they said it's
not a gaming phone no we didn't we
didn't say it's not a gaming phone oh I
thought they were saying razer said it's
not a game that's totally a gaming phone
who said it's not a gaming fun I don't
know where the chat sort of got that
from it's a gaming fun yeah it's a
gaming fun everyone agrees it's a gaming
phone yeah we don't know why it's a
gaming phone other than the high refresh
rate display that razer said it is got
some ram yeah yeah but it doesn't have
like okay this is it
okay I find razer very frustrating
sometimes and this is not because they
didn't send me a phone and they did send
some to other czech youtubers that's not
why I'm upset I did have a call with
them about that so we definitely talked
about it but yeah it's all good salty
but I did blow up their facility yeah
which is why I'm not salty anymore
apparently they're upset because they
call it a phone for gamers not a gaming
phone wow I don't care okay so the
problem with with so razer frustrates me
sometimes because they do this stuff
they're like and it has the most amazing
battery the best battery the biggest
battery my friends does an amazing
amazing that and he really did sound
like that at roy did you watch the
keynote the tremendous about it no i did
not watch the keynote okay it's it's
pretty it's pretty amazing it's
tremendous it's the best anyway the
point is they're just like and then they
show how big the battery is in his four
thousand milliamp hours and I was like
okay you do realize that the Galaxy s8
active is arguably a flagship phone
because it's a Galaxy s8 oh and by the
way it has a four thousand milliamp hour
battery so yes while technically you do
have oh and also it ignores the mate ten
so that's a whole other thing but you
could make the argument that if they're
not competing in the same markets then
it's the biggest and a flagship phone no
no there's no way that there's no way to
defend so there was so there was a lot
of embellishment and Razer does tend to
do these things I actually have a bit
coming in my upcoming review of the
Razer Blade 4k where there were three
things in there reviewers guide that
were either that ranged from misleading
to outright false and I'm just sitting
here going what are you guys even doing
it's good do your job here there's a lot
of companies that do kid
come on yeah I was just I was finding it
particularly cringe-worthy during yeah
yeah it's frustrating
during this dream yesterday apparently
the p2 has a 50 100 million power
battery so so there's that you know what
though I don't want to take anything
away from them about the front-facing
speakers and the 120 Hertz display both
of those very cool both of those things
yes make a enough of a gaming phone that
I'm not gonna raise them too hard yes I
agree I think the refresh rate I mean
there's there's so much emphasis on
pixel pushing like we have the highest
resolution phone ever no we have the
highest version and like everyone
forgets about refresh rate so it's kind
of cool to see a company like Razer
who's always been sort of more gamer
centric to come in and be like look
pixel count isn't the only thing that
matters you noobs and you know actually
do something about it so that's cool he
did drive me to appreciate that it did
drive me pretty crazy when they were
talking about how this was the first
mobile device with a variable refresh
rate 120 Hertz display because the last
time I checked the iPad pro is
technically not a phone but it's
definitely a mobile device that's true
technically a desktop is a mobile device
if you for people chatter asking what is
a gaming phone I think a 120 Hertz phone
is a gaming phone right now yeah I think
that's fair yeah yeah it's got extra RAM
it's got extra battery life it's got a
nice screen forward facing speakers so
you can sit there yep you think sure I
mean I can see why people are upset
about no headphone jack on a game phone
also razors camera looks pretty trashed
they just want you to be really
obnoxious on the train from the demo
shot speakers and they didn't really
okay I did - no to the stream before it
was completely over but they didn't
really talk about the front-facing
camera at all during the like the made
the meat of the announcement auto selfie
that bad well I don't know maybe it's
great but I would expect a gaming phone
to have a great front-facing camera
Wow yeah it's crazy
yeah streaming it's really--it for
streaming yeah yeah I would expect the
front-facing camera to be like as good
as the rear shooter if you're gonna say
yeah this is like V gaming phone yeah so
we'll see that makes sense um all right
so we have to do our sponsors now so
Kyle did you want to peace out I know
we've kept you an hour and a half after
when you said you had to go or do you
want to hang around alright so one last
time guys Kyle is now available on Flo
plane it's the best the best boat plane
the best float plane it's the greatest
it's insane this float plane Shane I
mean at being a plane that can float
it's pretty bad but at being a website
that streams things I mean it also
doesn't exist yeah it's not what ad
serving video through a forum we're
doing pretty good yeah yeah so you can
head oh yeah you can head over there
it's so you're aiming for one week
windows on your content saw one week
early access is that correct so there
you go guys go check it out bit weight
ultra and you can see the video that we
were talking about earlier the best the
best RGB fans on the market the best and
I will say I enjoyed your testing as
well that's good do you see that
buffering do you see how fast that video
is suffering ok arguably we're on 360p
yes so I did mention that I'm cheating a
little bit I'm still come on responses
playing look at that responsive player
I'll stop I'll stop pimping Kyle and
I'll stop chanting floatplane right now
alright and I will start pimping all our
sponsors for the web show today all
right see you Kyle
bye guys thanks bye
alright so number what is synergy oh my
goodness can you believe how late it is
I'm sorry you can leave too if you want
yes so late no I will stay synergy is
the solution to your problem of having
multiple computers with multiple
keyboards and mice and not wanting to do
that anymore
yeah you don't need that anymore this
this is terrible I know though that
those headphones I mean they're like
they literally are like the communal
bicycle except yeah the communal
monitors they're pretty oh gee I'm using
a festival like those are pretty those
are pretty use yeah
synergy lets you use one keyboard and
mouse across multiple computers you just
literally drag your mouse across the
screens after you configure synergy and
you just kind of say where all of your
displays are and boom you're using a
different computer and the keyboard
works with that one now
you can even drag and drop files you can
copy/paste the pro version includes
encryption for the data that's passed
between the computers and in my opinion
the coolest thing about synergy is that
it is cross-platform Windows Mac and
Linux Wow so whether you have like a
gaming box and a separate dev box or
whether you you know run apps that are
only available on Mac ones that are only
available on Windows my biggest thing
every time is if you have a laptop for
work a lot of people do that these days
you have a laptop for work you take it
home you just plunk her down turn it on
you're already done yep pretty cool so
it all runs over the network and you
guys can head over to seamless sym le SS

ZBOX mini pcs so they're giving this is
ZOTAC and then file this is awesome
they're giving away one pi2 twenty five
so this guy is fanless so zero noise to
USB 3 ports wireless AC and intel n 3350
processor I believe that's quad core and
four gigs of LP ddr3 memory so super
compact fanless machine was going to say
one of the real eyes of a two and a half
inch SSD yeah one of the really cool
things about this thing is it's so
freakin tiny this is I believe the
successor to the one that I used when I
was trying to do the build a PC in a
fridge project
oh really yeah I remember that super
tiny one that they had that was kind of
plasticky this one looks a lot nicer
actually it's really sharp it kind of
looks in a slightly nostalgic way it
kind of looks like a I don't know like a
battery bank or like it looks like a lot
of different things to be fair this
looks like a like it doesn't look like
it at all but like a 3.5 inch floppy
with the like slide II thing on top I
see your point
I see where you're coming yeah like no
but also sort of they're giving away in
mi5 53 so this guy's higher performance
a core i5 7300 HQ quad core it's got its
ready for obtain memory it's got
Thunderbolt 3 so you could even hook up
an external GPU to it at some point if
the price has ever come down on those
and basically this would be like a very
portable pretty slick little low-power
workstation and finally they are also
giving away a Z box Ian trend 70k - you
so this guy is available in a GTX 1060
or 1070 configuration and has a core i5
7500 T processor there's lots a quad
core processor this one the one that
we're giving away from that one comes
with the gtx 1070 but it's a bare-bones
so you're going to need to add your own
drive and ram so the giveaway will be
running for two weeks from today and the
link is actually i'm gonna post that in
the twitch chat we're gonna have it
below the archived video on youtube so
go check that out guys go join the
partay boom alright this was a week
where we actually had a lot of tech news
to cover and then just didn't so should
we try and go through some of the stuff
do you wanna talk about blizzard um I
mean I'm down I don't actually have a
ton to say surprisingly okay so this is
supposed to be honours on the form the
original articles from PC Gamer I can
keep it kind of short there's a lot of
places that this was trending on Twitter
which just shows how many people are
actually into it I think that's actually
kind of cool there's a huge amount of
gaming news articles that all announces
that like the same time I believe yeah
this one actually had some details from
blizzards vice president which was kind
of cool we are bringing back classic
servers this is a commitment to do it
this is not a it's coming now they've
asked for people to be
I'm kind of suspecting it's gonna be
like a year yeah while some of what they
said about why they couldn't do it
sounded like BS there are legitimately
probably some things that'll have to be
read well they're hiring a staff
specifically specifically for this which
is one problem they're gonna run into is
trying to find people that and they're
trying to make it so the staff is all
passionate about this project right so
trying to find very specific people I'm
sure there's tons of them but they're
gonna have to vet them all all that kind
of stuff they are changing certain
things they're they're they're not
making it so that this cross-server you
will be on one server which is very cool
that was one thing people were really
worried about is no looking for group
there's no looking for raid both of
those were very important to people but
they will be changing some things I
wouldn't be surprised if there's like
achievements and you can like buy
certain pets and like some of the some
microtransaction yeah 17 stuff yeah
maybe you can buy a certain amount
that's like from the store only like
they do in the morning gains I have no
idea but I wouldn't be surprised if
there's some micro transaction
anything's going on but I don't think
it'll be anything major I really hope
they don't add a character boost I don't
think they will I think it'll be okay
but who knows yeah no date it's gonna be
awesome
I'm definitely to be on it a lot of
people I know are gonna be on it which
is gonna be cool if you want to come
play with me I'm super down let's do it
up that's all I really have to say cool
yeah I'm very happy that they actually
did it
let me have a look and see if actually
some of this stuff we can watch the yeah
I don't know it's at the top of the
thing if you want to watch it I kind of
wanted to talk about this opposed to by
aluminium Tek on the forum original
article from The Verge Apple fired the
engineer whose daughter's hands-on video
of the iPhone 10 went viral when she
published it a long published early yeah
oh yeah and a lot of people are siding
with the engineer here basically what
went down was she published a vlog that
included a trip to the Apple campus to
visit her dad and see an unreleased
iPhone 10 the video was quickly picked
up by sites like nine-to-five mac and
spread even further on youtube this so
her dad basically violated a company
rule by allowing her to film the
unreleased handset as filming on Apple's
campuses is strictly prohibited the
video included footage of an iPhone 10
with special employee only QR codes a
notes app was also shown on the iPhone
10 in the video which appeared to
include code names of unreleased Apple
products Wow
so a lot of people are kind of defending
the engineer and that is super dumb yeah
basically yeah this was literally in
okay I haven't personally read an Apple
engineer employee agreement because I'm
not an engineer and I don't think I'm
sure this is a huge deal within it but
like yeah that's really bad take this
from someone who has never worked at
Apple and probably will never work at
Apple I know that this would get me
fired from Apple it is not rocket
surgery to figure out how secretive
Apple is and how seriously they would
take something like this and even if
they didn't want to do it they would
have no choice they are completely
backed into a corner on something like
this if the whole thing had been quiet
and the video hadn't gone viral and they
had like seen him doing it
like whoa yo remember you're not
supposed to film here that wouldn't have
been fireable probably if they could
have just kind of gone okay we all
dodged a bullet there but the fact that
this went viral the fact that it was his
daughter so they knew exactly who it was
everyone in the company would see this
and go oh well if he can do it then
hashtag Yolo who cares I can do it too
Apple is so secretive and the
development time on a project that Apple
would release whether it's an iPhone 10
or an Apple TV or who knows maybe it's
the Apple car whatever it is could be
anywhere from six months to 12 months to
24 months to 36 months a company like
that is working on tech that you won't
see for years and they have to take that
kind of thing seriously because you look
at how quickly their competitors will
try to clone what they're doing with the
level of secrecy that they've achieved
and now imagine if their competitors
knew that that was the direction Apple
was going you know a year or two years
or three years in advance they cannot
afford that that is Apple's entire value
as a you know whatever however many
billions of dollars of cotton that
they're worth that's apples value is
that they are for better whether you
agree or not that they're innovators
that they are trendsetters that they are
forward thinkers because the iPhone
itself as just a piece of cellular
communications hardware is not that
special I think we can all agree on that
and they had no choice sorry
people are saying in the chat that he
didn't know unfortunately it doesn't
actually matter no one cares yeah I know
and like someone in the comments on the
official post forum I believe it was the
verge was saying like oh this might be
really good for them actually because
some other company will just pick them
up not necessarily that's a it's a big
mark on your name in that industry like
Microsoft has fired people for this
before Nintendo has fired people for
this before I believe Sony is fire
people for this before
whether we hear about it or not the fact
that it's Apple that's the iPhone 10 is
probably
only reason that we're hearing about it
in Tendo fired not only one parent but
both really yeah
and one of them had like super nothing
to do with it nope you're family but
that's Nintendo yeah
and Nintendo is also very vicious about
these types of Indian banks and they
always have been
in other news Broadcom to acquire
Qualcomm I actually had no idea that
Broadcom was that big they should rename
to calm calm I felt like broad wall oh
people apparently line up for the iPhone
10 so while a lot of analysts were super
concerned about the fact that no one
seemed that amped on the iPhone 8
Bloomberg has this fantastic little
chart in their article on this where
they show lineups and I go lineups for
iPhones I don't know how exactly they
measured this they're people lining up
in the mornings I di what whatever
anyway it kind of makes sense this kind
of makes sense that plus and see he
would have had big lines because all of
a sudden there was a cheap iPhone which
was kind of neat I guess iPhone 4 was
sort of a big deal yeah it was
iPhone 6 6 plus was a huge deal and then
like nothing's really changed since then
and then iPhone 10 it's showing that
even though the iPhone 8 / 8 plus was
literally the least exciting iPhone of
all time the iPhone 10 is right back up
there with the 5 even if it's not up
there with the 4 the 5 s 5c and the 6
and 6 but then again the 4 and the 6 and
6-plus were freaking huge yep
so there you go maybe Apple is not going
out of business yet after all I don't
know umm what else we got going on here
razor phone

bye Boop I feel bad for James when we
only cover like a third of his topic and
this was a really good doc - yeah it was
actually an excellent of any week to not
cover topics this was the wrong one

really good time yeah I know I could
have talked about AMV epoch getting 64
