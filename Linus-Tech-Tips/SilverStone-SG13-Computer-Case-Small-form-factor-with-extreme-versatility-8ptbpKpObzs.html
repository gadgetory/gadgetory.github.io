mini beastmen machine in this
silverstone SG 13 with an 18 core intel
processor a titan x dual SSDs and other
things the case was able to fit
everything which by default made it
awesome considering how big it is so we
decided to review it and also don't
forget to stay subscribed to Linus tech
tips because scrapyard wars is finally
coming back
Kingston kc3 ten series business grade
SSDs feature firmware based power loss
protection massive capacities and
performance to spare in fact we're using
them for our new production server click
right here to learn more about them
starting on the outside of this 220
millimeter wide 181 millimeter tall 285
millimeter deep eleven point five liter
2.4 kilograms case we have a classy
aesthetic that will dynamically fit into
any home theater setup or any computer
desk with ease regardless of whether or
not you go with the higher airflow
dimpled mesh version that we have or
also the fake-o brushed aluminum option
just below the mesh on our unit is a
Silverstone logo in the bottom left hand
corner with dual USB 3.0 jacks and dual
3.5 millimeter audio jacks on the far
right hand side on the left side of the
case we see a very large mesh which
should allow for any compatible sized
graphics cards that's anything with a
length of 10.5 inches or below to
breathe quite easily also we see a
little bit of breathable mesh for the
front intake of the case just along the
side of the front bezel on top of the
case is a mostly plain although there is
a fairly sizable mesh on the back where
your PSU or other various incidental
case airflow could go through we decided
to mount our PSU with the fan on the
bottom to help pull air directly from
the system so it won't help there but
anyways over on the right hand side we
have the smaller mesh panel with
incidental airflow and yet again we see
a bit more breathable mesh for the
intake of the case just along the front
bezel the back of the case is pretty
simple revealing the cutout for an
internally mounted power supply an IO
shield at a little tiny bit airflow
meshing just above the externally
secured add-in card slots then we get to
the bottom which features four nice
little rubber feet which do a pretty
good job of keeping the case from
sliding around too much even with a fair
amount of force applied and it lifts aw
lifts it up off the surface by a little
bit and while this doesn't really help
with cooling by much as there's no mesh
on the bottom it does make picking it up
that much easier which leaves us with
four pre-cut holes for mounting an SSD
on the bottom of the inside of the case
once you remove the outer II kind of
u-shaped frame you see that the inside
of the case has well not much to be
frank there's a nice steel plate that
holds two SSDs or one hard drive up and
out of the way near the top of the case
which also features two little indented
bits where you can easily plug in the
SSDs or one cut out where you can plug
in the hard drive and then we have a
little bracket which helps hold up the
power supply so it doesn't bend the
frame of the case or droop onto any of
the other components and then which
brings us to the 120 millimeter or 140
millimeter fan or radiator mount in the
front of the case one word of warning
with this is be careful at the length of
your tubing is this can cause some
issues if you check this video out from
Linus and I building the system we had a
hell of a time getting everything to fit
due to the magic of editing you didn't
necessarily see all of that but it did
take us quite a long time to get
everything to work without any kinked
tubing just just me it was a bit of a
hassle but worth it considering it
worked and in the end we were able to
fit everything in this tiny tiny little
case and that's about it other than you
know like motherboard standoffs
do I sound disappointed I'm not I know I
might but I'm actually not that's all
there is but that's fine this case
actually makes that a good thing with
many cases you can have someone pick it
up and you'll know fairly accurately
what they're going to put inside of it
with this thing not really other than an
ITX motherboard and a graphics card it's
pretty much up in the air do they go
with the super crazy high-end sleeper
like system that Linus and I did with a
tight necks and 32 gigs of ram and an 18
core processor or ii think with a
low-power cpu and something like a send
50 TI because it doesn't take a
dedicated power slot so it doesn't take
up that much power at all just sipping
power for a home theater box it's a
cheap case but it looks classy as hell
and will suit whatever you decide to put
into it
so in conclusion like I just said it's
cheap but it feels fairly well built
it's small but it fits a lot in it for
its size it lacks an extensive feature
set yet somehow accommodates creativity
there's a fantastic and unique feeling
of really thinking that the component
you were trying to put into it isn't
going to fit even when you line it up
but then having it fit or finding a way
to fairly painlessly make
fit every damn time anyways this isn't a
100% unique case there's cases that are
very similar to this but especially at
this price point I think it does make
quite a bit of sense alright guys I look
a little bit different because I'm
actually in the middle of building my
system for scrapyard wars which is
coming soon but I had to pause for a
great message from our friends over at
mass drop they have something a bit
different for you guys today this thing
they currently have a drop available for
the chic smart s1 scooter which is a
self-balancing two-wheeled electric
scooter and it's rated at 12 miles of
range on a single charge and is capable
of traveling at up to 6 miles or 10
kilometers per hour while you won't be
breaking any land-speed records
necessarily or off-roading through the
hills on this pretty cool thing it's a
smooth travel on a smooth surface and
it's a pretty good conversation starter
due to its reserved but interesting
appearance of course this is available
through mass drop which means it's a
significantly discounted price thanks to
the group by model essentially the more
people that buy it the more the price
goes down to a set minimum with its
minimum price being just under 30% below
MSRP you can check out this drop and
many others at the link in the
description DRO PS / Linus tech tips so
head over there now if you are
interested that link doesn't actually
give us a kickback or anything but it
does let them know that we sent you what
do you guys think let me know in the
comments down below or over on the forum
before you go to the forum like dislike
favorites subscribe share follow all
that kind of happy fun stuff check out
the links in the video description below
this video to see things like Linus
Media Group's shirts or even a lanyard I
believe and some other cool stuff over
on the forum you can see the help Linus
Media Group button thing where you can
go see how to change your Amazon
affiliate codes or install one of the
forum add-ons which can kind of do it
for you and do a whole bunch of other
stuff as well anyways guys thanks for
watching become a contributor on the
forum and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
