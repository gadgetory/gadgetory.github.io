Texas at all but I am in Mexico for
something completely unrelated but there
are still things to cover in terms of
the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 so we'll be
doing that right now
intel skull Canyon Nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more of the link in
the video description this video's focus
will be new features that were announced
alongside Pascal in that keynote they
got a little bit overshadowed by the
speed and specs of the 1080 and 1070 but
they are awesome nonetheless we will
start with ansel which is like an
amazing screenshot software essentially
I know I might've lost you there was
screenshot but seriously it's cool the
first feature within Ansel that I want
to point out is super resolution and it
allows you to take screenshots up to a
resolution of 60 1440 by 30 4560 or 32
times the maximum resolution of your
screen holy crap next up is EXR capture
which gives you the highest color
spectrum of HDR images which is
fantastic for stuff like changing the
lighting in a scene then you have free
camera which allows you to change your
perspective drastically you can look
around corners you can look up from the
ground something you can't normally do
you can look up from way up in the sky
another thing you can't normally do
whatever you want you have free roam
with your camera let me have post
processing filters which allows you to
basically put those like classic
Instagram filters on top of pictures so
hopefully no one ever murders their
photos with these and we can just ignore
them and move on and last we noted here
but not least is 360-degree captures so
you can essentially take an image that
could be viewed in VR and then
absolutely use in videos VR viewer in
order to view it on something like your
phone if you have something like a
Google cardboard or whatever so you
could take a 360 photo of a particularly
epic scene share with your friends and
let them enjoy it as well this does have
to be enabled by the developer this
won't just be in every single game that
you play on a Pascal graphics card but
there are a number of games on the
lineup already including the division
the witness lawbreakers which are three
Paragon no man's sky and Unreal
Tournament
next up we have simultaneous
multi-project indisposed and off I'm
going to give you a scenario you're
gaming in a surround multi-monitor setup
your monitors on the outside look skewed
things don't line up with your main
monitor in the middle if you see a crack
on the
Loret kind of Jags off on the spare
monitor and things are skewed and weird
it sucks it's not really a great gaming
experience one example of what can be
done with simultaneous multi-project 'iv
so that allows you to fix the skew that
happens on those side monitors and fix
the alignment issues with your main
monitor because you have them at
different angles and that causes issues
there were massive improvements in this
field that were shown off in the
livestream and they make this scenario
go from not very usable to actually
quite usable in my opinion which is
great because multi monitor gaming has
been kind of weird for a long time
another thing that simultaneous
multi-project ssin does is massively
massively help VR performance but how it
necessarily does these things is still a
little hazy and under NDA so we'll
hopefully hear more about them in the
future and last but not least is Nvidia
VR works now I know VR works isn't new
at all but Nvidia VR works audio is it
uses Pascal generation GPUs to raytrace
sound waves in real time claiming to
realistically simulate reflections and
echoes in order to help locate things
using only sound which should
dramatically increase your immersion
levels this level of precision and
accuracy in audio could enable some
really cool things I hope that they
released the Star Wars demo where Luke
fights the training droid with a
lightsaber that would be a lot of fun
and while there's loads of work still to
be done in terms of VR immersion this
should hopefully add quite a few steps
in terms of the audio department which
is great country rolls aside created by
anime fans for anime fans they have the
most recent episodes straight from Japan
of shows like Digimon Adventure tri and
active raid they also have a large
collection of the most popular anime
series like Mobile Suit Gundam iron
blooded orphans and the asterisk war and
all of this content on their site is
professionally subtitled so head over to
crunchyroll.com slash lioness and you

Linus and check them out alright guys
hopefully you liked my top three let me
know in the comments down below or on
twitter at luke underscore at la Fr
don't forget to like just like subscribe
all those kind of fun things I almost
knocked over the graphics card that was
very scary
using our Amazon affiliate code to buy
stuff like you know a 1080 if you decide
to get one of those or a 1070 which I
expect a lot more of you will decide to
get but we'll see maybe you hate wait
for a GP 100 that could be a thing yeah
anyways buy a shirt description down
below and yeah I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
