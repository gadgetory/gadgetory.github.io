start the stream I wouldn't have you
know II used up on my bladder muscles if
I didn't want to start the stream I did
read the instructions I followed the
instructions we are not on the test
streaming thing you yes I did set the
title Thank You Jake your your you are
my chicken dinner like you're a winner
that's what that's what I mean I don't
mean that he's like kind of salty and
savory
I like your thighs all right so we see
white breasts a pretty mediocre show for
you guys today because frankly there
just says you I'm bringing the awesome
there just wasn't really a lot going on
this week why would you say that well do
you want people to leave they're not
gonna leave I mean they already went
through the effort of clicking on this
he'll go down the go down with me yeah I
mean the ship go down on the ship not
now you don't go down on the ship you
don't go down on you either that's oh
I'm trying to get out of here so we do
actually have some legitimately
interesting topics Google mandates two
years of security updates for popular
phones how do we define popular I guess
well oh we there's a definition cross
that bridge when we get to it mm-hmm
the meme tax means maybe you won't be
able to upload to YouTube yeah okay no
I'll talk I'll talk more bridges across
there's been another big win for right
to repair and the iPhone iOS 12 defeats
the grey key locker thing the police you
suck it please I mean blue lives matter
I mean ah let's get out of here roll the
intro wow you're so never coming on when
show
math I mean they're all right do you
think that you have RBF what is RBF
wresting mean face oh nesting mean
things um no that's the arresting face
at the camera
I would actually yeah I would much
rather hear if you think I have resting
resting be faces what's up so the only
reason that it really comes up in my
household a lot is that one of my
daughters yes she's just like - actually
she's the older one and it was much
worse when she was - so we talked about
all the time obviously we can't say the
B word so we'd say resting p face I've
never heard anyone could your face at
rest okay yeah no I mean we'll let the
audience we'll let the audience be the
judge I don't think you have RBF are you
kidding me I think it's more of a
conscious thing with you haha dude look
at my eyebrows from the side okay
pointing down before the show I was just
going over my notes I looked at with the
camera there I was like this is what I
look like when I'm just reading stuff
I'm just like yeah you had kind of an
intense vibe to you like I've actually
had I mean I don't think that the win
show is really the place to air like HR
to literally air it but I've actually
had people talk to me about how James
can be kind of intense like I'm not sure
if he likes me you know I think that
about Tyler I think Tyler I think I know
he's the nicest guy a teddy bear but he
also hates all of us I think I don't
think you guys I don't I think Tyler is
the least likely lmg employee to go
postal well there's but there's also
other things that are just personal
preference like if you walk by Tyler in
the morning you haven't seen him yet he
might just walk by you not care to say
good morning and I I'm fine with that
there's a lot of people here you want to
spend half your day saying good morning
yeah
there's 20 people like I I got past
saying good morning to everyone probably
around the time we hired you guys cuz
okay I mean you were basically everyone
that I passed in the morning was new and
therefore it didn't matter anybody knows
but there was just too many people all
of a sudden instead of because the
upstairs used to be used to be upstairs
there was no well there's there's
Chelsea that's right this whole the
sales team was there so there was no
Nick wasn't his
no he wasn't ya know when I started Nick
and Chelsea and Cole they're all in that
corner by we're Anthony and Alex are now
is this even interesting I mean it
doesn't really matter
okay we will get to why I'm wearing
eyeliner shortly because I think that's
what everyone's waiting - waiting to
hear because it's Friday night baby yeah
no and you've taken me out dancing
how come Batman doesn't dance anymore
Simpson's quo okay you know what I'll
explain why I'm wearing eyeliner
so we you must super chat us if you want
to no no anyway we're shells that's
that's the word on the street so
basically I take exception to razors
branding I mean I understand branding is
it's it's marketing and it's it's it's
not meant to be just like a purely dry I
do love this pillow though it's it's not
meant to be just like a purely dry
description of the product like if if
rays are called they're mice pretty good
Mouse that is pretty good and the
ergonomics are good enough that the pro
gamers we endorse didn't throw them away
and it's pretty expensive
but like it's pretty good like if they
called it that obviously no one would
buy it but if they call it Mamba mmm you
know that's how it sounds a lot more
appealing but the whole thing that
they've started doing over the last few
years where it's like they were
of themselves as the world's premier
lifestyle brand for gamers lifestyle
brand for gamers and I kind of I kind of
take exception to that because maybe I'm
wrong but to me when I especially when I
was younger when I didn't have like a
full-time job because I was still in
school to me what made something gaming
was that it was no frills and it was
like great bang for the buck and it had
nothing nothing about it that didn't
give more FPS function yes completely
function over form was gaming like an
Athlon XP 2500 plus was like a gaming
CPU because compared to I mean it's it's
it's funny some things never change
AMD fanboys we're just as diluted back
then as they were like two years ago
before rise and launched and they still
thought that AMD had processors worth
buying like it's it's amazing and and so
for me when I bought a Barton 2500 plus
I was the diluted AMD fanboy I was like
yeah I'm gonna overclock it to 2.2
gigahertz which is equivalent to a 3200
plus which is equivalent to a pea for
3.2 but that was just AMD's marketing it
wasn't equivalent to a pea force
northwood come on it was even close not
to mention that Northwood had
hyper-threading which at the time
remember this is pre dual-core made a
pretty significant difference to the
overall usability of the experience and
so to me if nothing else though a Barton
2500 plus was a gaming CPU because games
back then only used a single core so you
didn't need hyper threading to get
better FPS do you think that yeah the
industry started to add frills even in
gaming lineup things just by virtue of
there being more competition like there
you think there are there more gaming
products now more game aquatic lines now
and then to differentiate they add in
these they're just less Spartan because
it is different so hard to differentiate
these days and so I don't
don't blame them for doing it but
basically the reason that I have the
remnants of eyeliner on is because I'm
kind of taking the piss as like a gaming
lifestyle sort of character at the
beginning of the video for the razor
phone to which is gonna be an
interesting video by the what I've saw
the getup how is that okay I'm like edgy
I'm an edgy that's you trying to shop
you have such a warped review okay
obviously it's like over-the-top and
stupid so that's all you know what well
yeah yes very over-the-top various do
okay just I mean one part of the
ensemble you didn't see was that I have
a messenger bag that has an RGB keyboard
in it that is illuminated as I'm just
walking down the street that's a very
Ed's little type thing to do yeah so so
it's it's like it's like my gaming this
is more of an accessory and less of an
actual like how many FPS do I get per
dollar and I die that's kind of my
that's kind of my thing what should have
been on a hoverboard I probably should
have been on a hoverboard are we gonna
do news I know you guys always do news
like when I'm not on the show and I'm
kind of I'm kind of trying to I'm kind
of trying to fight it because let's do
some super Chad's yeah um what do we got
here wha
I see kurosu says I was gonna ask why
you don't refer to floatplane comments
and only YouTube like in the iPhone
response video and then I saw you just
did a floatplane exclusive fair trade
you know the best man keep it up
well thank you thank you you're the best
- you're sorry me dude and bomb - link
says paying the line is tax again for
great free content you don't have to pay
a tax for something that's free paying
the Lynas tax for a great free contact
oh the taxes that he has to listen to
you hey mate watching what the heck are
New Zealand Dollars oh I'm a did all
right
fine we'll do we'll do a news topic wait
are you gonna answer that first question
no I don't know
that was a paragraph but oh yeah yeah he
was like he's cool with it sounds like a
cool what yeah he was like why do you
only refer to YouTube comments when you
do like a response video okay I guess I
could answer that it's because YouTube
comments are more recognizable if we put
up comments that are formatted for
floatplane only the like thousands of
people on Flo plain are gonna be able to
relate to it so we tend to try to go as
mainstream as possible in the content
itself which is why you'll hear me say
things like dislike the video if you
want
even though floatplane doesn't have a
dislike button so is this person
referring to like graphically what they
see on screen when we include comments
and they pop up or are they asking why
do they always probably look like
YouTube comments okay um Ben says please
remember to mention folding months yeah
it's folding month that's in the dock it
is folding month I've been folding for
like three weeks already so I'm Way
ahead use suckas but all month it's
folding at home which is using your
computer as a in a distributed network
to help research different fight
diseases like including cancer and
Alzheimer's and all sorts of stuff you
have any bola stuff in there it's cool
kind of topical right now I am warming
up my house also turning the heat on all
the super chats are for you Eddie says
oh snap its lazer time boys yeah all
right fine we'll do it we'll do news
topic Google mandates two years of
security updates for popular phones this
was posted by diehard to live on the
forum you read that like you never seen
that before like I post all the time
yeah I know but like I hate typing it so
he's that's what I do now okay it's
great he's like he's like we need to do
these news topics I mean do you know how
long James spends every week making sure
that in the event that Luke and I can't
figure out anything off topic to discuss
we will have something to talk about
only for us to ignore like 80% of the
topic sometimes do you do you ever go
back and look at like what we did cover
and what we didn't and get triggered
sometimes I thought well I did and I
stopped doing that when me and Luke do
it we do the news yeah okay but I also
include fewer topics like when him and I
do it I'll just put like eight in there
hey I put a couple I left a couple in
last week that I'd said hey we should
really cover these next week and you
took them out you didn't tell me that
well I put it in the duct oh you just
you just overrode it no I scroll to the
bottom see if anyone posted news items
then I control a and delete oh okay
so the original article here is from the
verge com and in a nutshell every month
the security team at Google releases a
new set of patches for Android and every
month carriers and manufacturers
struggle to get them installed on the
actual phones that people are actually
using making that effort feel like well
like James's effort on the web showed
are wasted so confidential contracts
obtained by the verge show that many
manufacturers now have explicit
obligations related to updates so this
is Google trying to close in on the
Apple lead because that's it a really
important part that our place that Apple
still has an advantage we didn't
explicitly cover that in the latest why
iPhones are awesome video we did talk
what's updates yeah we talked about
security but we didn't specifically talk
about security updates and the
scheduling and the schedule in the
advantages they have here so this is
sweet do you think it's gonna work well
they're requiring the requirements are
regularly installed updates for any
popular phone or tablet for at least two
years they must provide at least four
security updates within one year of the
phone's launch the security updates are
mandated within the second year as well
but without a specified minimum number
of releases and then these terms cover
any device launched after January 31st
2018 that's been activated by more than
100,000 users so that's your definition
of popular a hundred thousand users so
I've talked about this a fair bit in the
past where you might encounter like a
really cool device of some sort like a
phone that's got like a really neat
accessory I think the ROG gaming phone
is gonna be a great example of something
like this where it's it's really cool
it's got some features that are truly
standalone in the market like it's got a
90 Hertz OLED display it's what you
wanted the razor phone to be yeah pretty
pretty much the first one yeah well
neither of them
quite what I wanted the first razor
phone too because I wanted it to have a
good camera and neither of them are good
enough quite frankly so I think the ROG
phone is a great example this has got
really cool accessories have you seen
the dual screen one yeah okay so we have
a video coming we actually got our hands
on all of the accessories for the ROG
phone so we've got the the game
controller that clips onto the sides
we've got the dual screen so it comes
with a six thousand milliamp hour
battery in it it's got like kind of an
ergonomic handle like controller handle
for it and then it's got a second screen
in the bottom kind of DS style that you
can actually run apps independently on
which tripped me out so our thumbnail I
think we were gonna do for the thumbnail
and title we were gonna do we got every
ROG phone accessory you know but I think
what we're gonna go with is this phone
runs two games at once yeah yeah Jake
was tell me he had two separate games
running yes yeah not bad depending on
the games that actually yeah could be
practical if you're playing something
turn-based or something with waiting
times you could play it like a hand of
Poker while you're also I don't know
playing Pokemon go or some crab okay I
guess I could get into that I mean but
the use case that we show isn't a very
good one we have pub G running on the
top and minecraft on the plateau oh and
the pub G and fortnight would have been
funny so at one point in the video I'm
playing the top screen and like Jake's
got his hands and like in here like
playing the bottom screen we're just
looking at each other this is ridiculous
that's the best phone when you've got
two kids yeah yeah so they can vote they
can vote if you jus don't learn to share
then I'm gonna make you both share the
same one forever there it is
so anyway back to what I was saying even
if you find a device that has like a
really cool feature there that you like
you can you can end up having a bad
experience almost no matter what you do
because until you reach a certain
threshold which is apparently a hundred
thousand users you are even if you buy
something like really expensive like a
red hydrogen one would be a great
example of this it's $1500 phone for the
titanium version the manufacturer can
only afford to support that which is
popular that which sells well
and you might think well I paid $1,500
for this phone they should be able to
support it but the issue is that even if
you even if they were making $500 a
phone versus $300 a film at someone like
you know Samsung was making if they're
only selling a thousand units and
Samsung is selling a hundred thousand
units and these are all completely
hypothetical numbers a thousand units
times 500 bucks is still only what is
that five hundred thousand dollars the
math checks out yeah you can't you can't
have a team of engineers working on this
product for two years after their
release continuing to provide updates
for that kind of a budget the numbers
just don't work out and this is why in
the past I would always say when you're
shopping for a motherboard don't shop
for the best motherboard shop for the
most popular motherboard because that's
the one that a they're gonna have the
budget in order to provide support to
and B that's the one where they're gonna
have the loudest number of users
squawking at them if they don't do it
properly so there's gonna be a lot of
pressure on them whereas like it's a
funny thing like I remember back in the
days of Quad SLI when in video launch
the 7950 GX - I think is what the card
was called but it was like this bizarre
like I know this is pre or like gaming
enthusiasm days probably PC sure so it
was this bizarre card because it had a
big PCB and then it had like a second
one and it had like a cooler on each one
of them so one of the GPUs was like
sandwiched right between the other PCB
and it was only a dual slot card like it
was then it was really you know what I
should probably just bring up a picture
for us - yeah 750 G X - this is a really
weird card look at this thing see that
so you've got your oh yeah that's weird
your main PCB that plugs into the slot
and then you've got this second daughter
board that had all the i/o on it and see
this cooler here it actually had the
same cooler under here it was completely
suffocated check this out take this out
and then power only came in on this one
and was passed through I don't remember
how
like it was it was a weird card anyway
there was a use case for this card
four-way SLI this was the first time you
could run four GPUs in SLI
for envy actually I don't think dude
whoever did that so this was the first
time you could run four GPUs in SLI and
the experience was terrible because the
weird thing is and I'm not I'm not
singling out in video here the weird
thing is companies seem to feel like
these customers that are giving them
$1500 in this case was I think about
what a couple of those would cost you
that the customer is giving them these
huge amounts of money well they must be
just such fanatics that even if we don't
update this and support this properly
they're gonna keep coming back and
giving us money anyway so whatever
whereas the mainstream user the one that
really thinks about value for their
dollar and goes out and buys you know a
GTX 1063 gig or an RX 570 or whatever
the case may be that customer I feel
like is more value sensitive and
therefore will complain much louder if
it doesn't get supported properly does
that kind of make sense well I wonder if
these people who these adopters of the
high high-end stuff like this do you
think they're mostly the type who aren't
gonna be using this stuff for a really
long time because they're gonna get the
latest and greatest every cycle or do
you think that they have the mindset of
I'm spending a lot now and this is gonna
last me a long time you would just say
it's 50/50 80/20 I would say that from
from working at NCIX
my experience was probably closer to
like 95 five like which way the guys
that are buying the high-end the really
high-end stuff its toys for boys whereas
there's a there's a 5% of them that go
you know what I just don't want to
replace my computer very often so I'm
just gonna get the best thing now but
the reality of it is if you especially
then like back when I was working in the
computer stores like 10 years ago or
whatever especially then it was a
terrible terrible idea to buy the
highest end thing now and hoped that it
would be future proof these days I would
actually make the argument it's not
nearly as bad like if you went out and
you bought yourself
59 60 X so that was an extreme addition
and like three years ago that was an
eight-core processor okay we have now
just now gotten to the point where the
mainstream is getting an 8 core
processor you you effectively and yeah
they're much higher clock all that stuff
like you don't expect it to run exactly
like the brand new one but you're still
hanging in there whereas if you bought
yourself at that time a would have been
like a forty seven seventy you are now
getting to the point where there are
going to be games right around the
corner that are gonna want more than
four course so yeah that person who
spent more might get another year or two
out of their system that kind of makes
sense sure so you think then so what you
described a second nowhere it's 95 five
then that is an incentive for companies
to support the most popular or not the
most expensive yeah but okay going back
to the phones though right the original
thing right the actual topics in look
here's the thing the chain is longer
than just the the provider of a software
in this case Google and then the OEM
there's an there's the carriers as well
and they don't talk about the carrier's
here and with Android phones the
carriers can put in their own special
sauce so a new Android comes out then
the OEM augments it to their liking
then the the carrier puts their own
special care of your apps on it and that
takes the TV that takes two to three
weeks at best yeah what happens when
these om czar all begin to do four
security updates a year the last one
that comes out for that year gets
delayed because the carrier has to spend
a month working on it reaches the
contract with Google and then they get
reprimanded like what's gonna happen it
looks like what could happen is if they
fail to keep the device is updated
Google could withhold approval for new
devices so they could like play the game
where they could be like okay you know
what we're we're really busy you know
working on something right now we don't
have anything new to launch at the
moment so we can fall behind and then
we'll like get it dealt with later when
we need to release something but I think
the big thing for me is I have yet to
see any evidence that Google has the
stones to back this up
because they're still allowing carrier
nonsense that as far as I can tell
Apple shut down ages that's correct like
it there's I think you just cited one
from algae but there's our from a
carrier but there's eighteen T like one
drive type stuff eighty has so much
arising but they're not on Apple phones
at all yeah at all so do you think that
if it becomes a problem where the
carriers of the limiting factor here
that we're making the OEMs late with the
contractually obligated updates then
maybe Google or the kit or those OEMs
will just crack down and be like there's
no more carrier app baloney at all we're
not doing it I don't know how they'd
pull it off because the thing is that a
lot of like it's all about positioning
right the reason Apple can get away with
it is because the iPhone is a top to
your device so the carrier is not
expected to you know sell it for $0 on
contract and then subsidize it with like
cloud storage and like a TV subscription
and an NBA subscription and all that
kind of crap all that kind of add-on
stuff that they can use to subsidize the
cost of that hardware in the first place
plus there's competition because if
you're an Android device if you're the V
30 they're like well we don't like your
terms we're just gonna have the P 20 so
yeah yeah just another flagship Android
yep so I think that Apple's in a fairly
unique position there but I do also
think that carriers like Samsung they
should be in a position where we
shouldn't have to deal with that anymore
so I'd like to see them push back harder
like one thing that has really irked me
about Samsung over the last couple of
generations I actually don't know if the
note 9 did it I'd have to put in a
difference in to find out but
immediately when you put in a SIM it
comes unlocked and you put in a SIM and
it locks to that carrier oh that's weak
which to me is completely unacceptable
that's weak dude you know what I learned
today yeah you know Samsung has the
greatest market sure obviously globally
but even in nor in North America they
have like 35% there there's more people
in North America with Samsung's than
iPhones vote today I learned that in
China their penetration is only like 5%
in China it's all Chinese phones isn't
that crazy
the thing that really baffles me is that
especially a couple generations ago the
cameras on the non Chinese phones were
so night and day better than the Chinese
ones that it just like I couldn't figure
out why the demand didn't overcome
weather like I and forgive me because
I'm speaking out of ignorance here I
don't know if it's nationalism I don't
know if it's import tariffs I don't know
if it's other governmental restrictions
I don't know what the factors are why
they only use Chinese phones but you'd
think the demand for better might have
outstripped whatever those other factors
were in people would have people would
have been able to go oh wow this is like
very obviously way better but because I
mean there weren't there weren't even
huge cost differences in many cases are
you sure we're flagship Chinese phones
weren't they subsidized see that I don't
know so maybe there is a huge difference
I do know though that some of the
flagships now are really priced about
like South Korean or North American flag
ships I mean of course there are but I
mean like where they were designed so
last week you guys well I wrote it in
the notes I don't know if you talked
about it but we learned that because of
GD our GPD are yeah and your rd GD PR
and whatever do you argue all the
notifications on all your favorite web
so who was found to be illegally acting
monopolistically he's leaving I'm
talking to you I'm talking to everyone
but I'm also talking to you you know so
Google had to unbundle it was it used to
be the case that even though Android is
the open source the what was it the Play
Store Google Chrome chrome and Google
search always had to come on the phone
and there was all bundled and that was
illegal so then they ordered them to pay
a big fine and now they have to give
options to OEMs yeah and so a device
gets subsidized by the fact that
Chrome's on there because there's
advertising revenue but and then now if
you're gonna be able to get an Android
phone that doesn't have Chrome on it
then Google sauce to make that money so
they're just charging a licensing fee
but we did know how much it cost
and now we know and interesting is this
kind of gives us an idea of how much
money Google expects to make off the
Play Store off chrome and off Google
search well I think that this the fees
here would be slightly higher than what
they made off of that I think so too
because I'd be I'd be given I'd be given
the EU the old you know I'd be ok maybe
not the old su but I'd be trying to
create pressure I'd be trying to say
look yeah the way you had it was pretty
good so you don't like it okay here's
something worse doing you've got options
now but there's a clear incentive to go
for to just go back yeah exactly
so what we found out is that it could
cost up to $40 per device sorry 40 bucks
a device that's how much the iPhone
Apple was paying for the Samsung but
hold on oh let's consider consider this
you guys the bomb cost of like an iPhone
10s bomb means bills yeah the bare
hardware cost of something like an
iPhone 10s are like a note 9 is
somewhere in the neighborhood of usually
what around 250 to 350 bucks that's all
we actually had all those figures in one
of our why are you buying this okay the
point is they are like a third to like a
quarter of the final sale price because
there's a lot of costs associated with
bringing something to market including
whether you like it or not things like
advertising that do factor into the
final price of the phone so adding
$40.00 just right there up front
$40 has the potential to increase your
phone's cost somewhere in the
neighborhood of like 20% oh sorry I'll
let you keep okay so so how much they
cost depends on the country in the you
and the type of device so he you
countries are divided into three tiers
with the highest countries the highest
fees come from the UK Sweden Germany
Norway and Netherlands and in those
countries the devices with higher pixel
densities pay more so if you've got a
pixel density higher than 500 PPI then
you got to pay the $40 fee and the
phones that have PP eyes like that are
pixels per inch
include pixels two and three XL and the
s 9s 9 plus interesting then the next
year down is 400 to 500 pixels per inch
and they have to be 20 bucks in those
countries yeah and that's the pixel 3
the small one and interestingly all the
iPhone tens the 10 the 10s the 10s max I
surprised that all those iPhones have
lower pixel densities than the pixel 2
XL even the new well-nigh though 10 s
has a lower pixel than season I mean
it's Apple Apple went straight to retina
and then just completely backed off they
were like yeah no this is good enough
well and frankly I agree with them Wow
because you can't tell looking at an
iPhone 10s or 10s max
that it has lower pixel density than a
note 9 or NS 9 plus mode cannot tell
well that's what retina is that's
exactly the point so then the next tier
is under 400 pixels per inch aware you
only pay ten dollars in those expensive
countries and the iPhone 10 R fits into
that category but then in some other
countries where they're you know not the
high yeah high paying countries the fee
can be as little as two dollars and
fifty cents per device like a budget
phone in India well I wonder if this
really gives us some insight into how
much Google expects that given user to
contribute directly to their bottom line
or if it's just kind of a nephew and
it's the and 250 is closer to what they
would expect to make no I think that the
the fees are too they're they're geared
toward increasing androids penetration
in those markets so I think that right
the user in India they just want their
devices in India yeah so they're just
and maybe they maybe they're saturated
in UK and Netherlands right so maybe
they just don't really care at that
point oh I'd really like to know I mean
can you imagine like let's let's kind of
like imagination craft for a second here
can you imagine if this had happened
back when Microsoft was still in the
game with Windows Phone because that was
one of Microsoft's big disadvantages as
they are charging for the operating
system well now Google is being put in
the position where they have to charge
for the operating system it levels the
playing field because Apple
has to charge for the operating system
you have to cover your costs somehow
so you either cover your costs through
advertising and subsidies through your
marketplace or your Play Store app store
whatever you want to call it or you
charge for it by charging for it you
have to pay software developers they
aren't free tech deals sent a super chat
here he's like free software isn't free
film at 11:00 like yeah it's that clear
what I think is really interesting is
the fact that Android is open source
when we we kind of feel entitled with
the things that should come with Android
like the Play Store you think that's an
integral part of Android but it's not
it's a Google service just like Chrome
and search and maps and all that and
that's what we found out with this
unbundling huzzah gamers says first
super chat please please turn up the
streaming volume I turned it up I don't
know if it helped better rip a bump it a
little good yeah hopefully that's a
little better
oh Lord any more SC's Oh
tech support Josh says why don't we have
Ltd limited edition sandals I really
want them you know you know what yeah
I'm committing it right now we're gonna
make it happen guys it'll happen at some
point but it's it's not an insignificant
amount of work like it's really gonna be
a lot of work speaking of a lot of work
telling you guys about all of our
sponsors for this week right well number
one is the elgato stream deck mini you
can edit the links below the archive
mm-hmm so it allows you to concentrate
on your stream instead of trying to
memorize keyboard shortcuts OneTouch
operation means that you can start your
stream announce your live play
animations and more without ever having
to take your eyes off the action with a
total of six LCD keys I wish I had one
on me that I could show you guys
whatever Taryn loves these things so
they're these little like tiny mini
keyboards they have so these the mini
has six keys and they've all got a
screen on them so you can put icons on
them that are totally representative of
what kind of action they execute it's
really cool and you can change them to
whatever you want and oh that's that's
funny
my next note is that it's not just for
streamers one of our editors Taryn has
two of the bigger stream decks on his
desk and he's had them there for over a
year now
huge deck yeah he uses them for macros
for Adobe Premiere so they're available
for Mac or Windows and they're less than
a hundred bucks to learn more at the
link in the video description which will
be there when this video is live and
there is a video description it's also
brought to you by fresh books from books

should we do another topic maybe one
more topic and then will it just be s
for another you know 15 20 minutes and
come up call that good what do you think
what's the most important most important
element X that's our headline topic it's
like right in the thumbnail we have to
do it okay then so this was posted by RC
mail on the forum and basically the e
used new copyright directive known as
article 13 a lot of people were
criticizing the episode of tech linked
this week where I was raging out about
this saying too little too late you guys
you should have covered it before and
I'm kind of sitting here going well I
didn't think this was gonna go through
and we have it we have head coverage on
this for quite some time and also as if
it matters we're not even in the EU well
I mean it's gonna affect us so let's
talk let's talk about our no no I just
mean like how much how much swayed like
oh are we that important no we're not
but at least we can we can try to make
some noise now because even though $300
it has passed the first vote I should
hope not
no it's 300 whatever a is I that's not
Australian is it no probably a US I
don't know it doesn't yeah I think it's
a you from so there's no real desire
there's no real new news the only new
news about this is that the YouTube sea
you publish a blog post an open letter
I'm just talking about how it's gonna
affect their service and how dramatic
the changes could be should this can you
know continue so just as an update on
the situation the first round of voting
has gone has come and gone and it passed
and I don't believe that they have ever
had something fail to pass at the second
round of voting that did pass the first
round so we are really on the verge of
making platforms responsible not just
responsible but also liable for the
content that is on their websites to put
this in context now it does specify that
its major platforms or whatever the case
may be but there's I why is that one
five important I it's probably
quantified I don't know exactly how
they're quantifying it but I still think
it's important because floatplanes
pretty major I mean this has the
potential to impact even something like
Linus tech tips calm for him like it was
a number of years ago now but there like
there are things that already work like
this so back when back when we were
still using Adsense for Linus tech tips
calm not that it never made a ton of
money or anything so it wasn't a big
deal but we had a poster desktop
wallpaper thread that was like many many
dozens and dozens of pages long because
everyone were just posting their desktop
wallpapers and some people's desktop
wallpapers are their home not their work
desktop because they wouldn't be safe
for work and so we ended up with some
pretty racy images on the forum and
quite frankly like post your desktop
wallpaper threads are the kind of thing
that doesn't typically get moderated
very actively so what happened was we
ended up with some some content on the
website that Google deemed to be
contrary to their restrictions for
Google Adsense and they cut us off and
they said you guys need to get your site
back in line before we will turn it back
on and you guys are responsible for
scouring your web site making sure
there's nothing on it we kind of
we have literally thousands of posts a
day of user-generated content like this
is not feasible to actually filter
through every freaking post and make
sure that we don't have any hate speech
or any nudity or any graphic violence or
whatever the case may be like we do our
best but we rely on our community to
flag things and a lot of the time the
community will go like yeah it's not a
big deal in Google though it's terrible
so I guess what I'm trying to say is
that it's unlikely that something like -
tech tips forum would actually be
affected by article 13 because it's
pretty small fish and so would something
like float plane be but the problem is
that everything small if it's good will
grow and this situation where the
platform has to be responsible
ultimately we got our Adsense revoked
and we never got it back in case you
guys are wondering how that story ends
this situation is ultimately untenable
because with the amount of
user-generated content that someone like
a YouTube or Facebook or even - tech
tips com forum is receiving you would
have to hire so many staff just to sit
with like their eyeballs their their
eyelids stapled to the tops and bottoms
of their eyes staring at their screens
watching it come in the number of people
you'd have to pay to do that would be it
would be unmanageable you would never be
able to have an online platform that can
just accept any user uploaded content
willy nilly that's what I'm trying to
say is that even though we might not be
affected by this in terms of the
platforms that we run we have been in
this situation and it's not feasible so
the quote from this blog post yes she
says it would be too risky for platforms
to host content from smaller original
content creators because the platform
would now be directly liable for that
content the proposal could force
platforms like YouTube to allow only
content from a small number of large
companies so basically what she's saying
and so you're basically going back to
cable she clarifies things
further later like I think she's saying
like there's possibilities that they
could prevent EU users from accessing
non EU content or they could prevent
like like there's there's ways that
maybe they could geofence it or whatever
the case may be but but ultimately yeah
it's like going back to the Stone Age
like we've had YouTube the way it is
user-generated content video content
like it's amazing for over ten years now
and to go back to not being able to just
have anyone upload any stupid dog video
and maybe you go viral and maybe you
know make a couple thousand bucks or
whatever I'd like to take away that or
upload a video of them reviewing a
laptop in their kitchen and maybe one
day employ 22 people and so that's
that's something that really upsets me
is that there's a lot more to YouTube
now than just the user-generated content
even because we I sincerely doubt would
be big enough to qualify as a small
number of large companies there's just
no way like they couldn't possibly
manage everyone our size on the platform
I don't think it makes any sense because
remember guys we're not like monitoring
video content is not the same as even
something like a forum where you can
kind of skim images yeah it looks fine
you can't really just depend on the
machines to do this and you can't
there's no way even Google is basically
admitting we can't do it and if they
can't do it I don't think anyone else is
in a position to go say with 100%
confidence that they'd be comfortable
with it so so this could affect us in a
huge way and it's not just me personally
but the YouTube ecosystem props up
hundreds thousands tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands of people's actual
livelihoods now but it's not just the
indie youtubers who are who are who have
managed to go independent and managed to
support themselves but there are
reasonable sized to enterprises like
again so we employ between minus Media
Group and floatplane 26 or 27 people
like it's at the point now where I've
lost track which is you know really cool
but also really scary because if all of
a sudden we were cut off
from our European viewership that could
significantly impact us like we've taken
a very conservative approach to growing
our business and we've kept our costs
under control my commitment to you right
now James is even if all of our European
viewership goes away tomorrow night your
job will be safe and so will everyone's
here but other people might be riding
the razor's edge a little tighter or
they might be in a really vulnerable
state right now where maybe I think a
great example would be tech deals tech
deals as one of the guys on flip lane
right now he'd send a super chat earlier
so tech deals just obtained a new studio
space what if we took a 20% hit to his
income right now
yeah his most vulnerable time at his
most vulnerable time like this was
ultimately why Linus media group went on
vessel because we had just obtained a
new space just hired some people we were
looking to expand and then it was
YouTube that time but YouTube released
this memo saying that we weren't going
to be able to monetize our videos
through third parties the way that we'd
been doing up till remember like holy
crap are they're just gonna like rip all
our videos down what are we gonna do and
I think there's gonna be a lot of people
panicking like this so should we be
freaking out
yes and then there's all these other
applications like we just had a
municipal election in Vancouver or in
the whole region what about all those
random city councillor people who just
wanted to tell the constituents they're
their little platform boom it goes on
YouTube where are they gonna put that my
Squarespace like YouTube is actually
kind of a public service in a lot of
ways and there's things that obviously
we can see about it that are clearly not
public service type things like the way
that they moderate the content or the
way that you know ad pocalypse affected
some people disproportionately compared
to others but it does still have a role
in that space and it would be a huge
loss to not have it anymore I mean you
look to at the way that the way that
protesters or activists can use YouTube
to get a message out so that's where I
was going this is really really
important and I mean like I said I
hadn't taken it seriously enough before
because I just thought that people
we're gonna realize that this is
obviously not sustainable and can it at
some point I guess we didn't get there
well what about the the argument that
it's it's maybe if you think of the
worst the worst ways these laws can be
interpreted it would it would just
totally ruin the internet but then if
they actually just go ahead with that
kind of a light touch then it won't be
that bad
the issue though is that it's a question
of liability so platforms are already
responsible for the content that users
post on them that's the whole point of
DMCA where if there's a copyright
infringement you are responsible for
having a way to get in touch with you
and having someone review those requests
in a timely manner and then removing the
content that's the way it works now and
I understand there are problems with
that because you end up with a lot of
copyrighted content that just never gets
pulled down because you don't have
enough manpower to go through all these
video hosts innocent until proven guilty
yes um whereas this new way is just
gonna kind of assume that everyone's a
filthy pirate and is uploading you know
copyrighted material until they prove
that they didn't by becoming a large
company so are you going to New York
this weekend yeah where you going I
don't remember exactly this is like a
hybrid between a news topic and just
like what do you do it oh because
there's a nice is going to the one +60
event in New York on Monday this is
funny and it's only on Monday because
Apple decided we should probably have a
second event because no one cared about
our stuff and then they scheduled their
second event for the same day oneplus
was scheduled the oneplus is just bumper
today earlier this is exactly and I
blame Apple for this this is exactly why
I've gotten so annoyed with this trend
where every company needs to have their
own little little song and dance and
stage and music and blah blah blah free
time they launch a stupid product and to
be clear I'm not saying the products are
always stupid sometimes they're amazing
but it's frustrating because it used to
be that you could go to one place and
you could see all the announcements or
at least I
and full of places as long as you hit
like Computex yeah yes and like you know
maybe I don't know game calm III yeah
like as long as you hit kind of the main
big ones and then maybe a couple smaller
nice ones when Apple was different
what's the film industry one I don't
know but there's the graph graph
graphics or no see graph I'm not gonna
cigarette not say graph
regardless Apple was thinking
differently and then they pioneered the
whole like we're gonna have our own
keynotes NAB maybe yeah and it worked
and it worked and then all the me two
companies were like hey we have
flagships that are competitive I mean
now even Intel's doing it they launched
a CPU they've got an event in New York
and everybody's got a jet into New York
and we're gonna talk about our CPU in
New York it's kind of cool but there's
just too many companies and that's
people if it was a handful of times a
year I Love New York
cool city I don't need to go there half
a dozen times in a calendar year just to
see whatever work events in China yeah
or if the events in China which I have
you've got Samsung Microsoft oneplus
Apple Nvidia Intel like there's six
companies six companies launches two
products a year you are traveling at
least once a month and the thing about
these trips and these events is that
they're structured in such a way that
actually you're gonna see for my oneplus
video I love the way that they've done
it so to be clear a lot of this ranting
is not necessarily directed at one plus
but if each of them launches just two
products here you're traveling once a
month and the problem with these events
is the way that they're structured is
such that you don't really get any
useful insight into the product but you
couldn't have gotten from just like
watching the Verge's recap yeah I'm
watching the hashtag on Twitter yeah and
kind of looking at some of the come to
you yeah okay I got the gist of it and
that takes 20 minutes whereas getting a
plane flying somewhere waiting in line
sitting in the auditorium playing with
your like goofy bracelet that flashes
every time
Samsung employees say something amazing
or whatever it's very time-consuming and
I have a life and then you gotta do the
coverage on the show floor audio
stressful the audio sucks the video
sucks the internet connection sucks
there's people all around some of them
smell nothing I'm generalizing about the
tech industry but like just a
proportionate number of them smell I
don't know man it's just it's rough and
I'm not to be clear I have the greatest
job in the world I will I would never
complain about my job it's just that
there are frustrating things that I feel
could be done better it's constructive
criticism take it that way do you think
that oneplus benefits from the fact that
Apple bumped them cuz now they got
another wave of media and all bunch of
articles about them I have no idea I
don't know if it makes it better or
worse do you think that Apple always
plan to have two events yes I think that
Apple probably plans their events a year
in advance hmm we should do a couple
Super chats before we before we go here
okay oh wow there's so many of them I
don't know if I will get to them all
serrated well the EU ruling effect which
I would think so in fact I could see it
affecting twitch more than someone like
you to what it's streaming that's really
weird
it's impossible it's like actually
impossible well would they would the
streamers have to agree to Terms of
Service that well I'm sure they already
do obviously but thank you I ability
would pass three of them or something I
have no idea like just promise you won't
swear right I never finished that
thought before the issue is the
liability the issue is that even if it's
a light touch enforcement of it if the
platform is liable versus just being
able to respond to DMCA takedowns and go
okay we did our job then you know if
someone like you know universe Disney
okay let's take a lettuce company like
Disney we're to go okay the damages of
that movie rip being up there for 48
