DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts right so this is
about as expensive as it gets for a
motherboard that's intended for a
platform that's all about the
performance of its onboard graphics the
question then is how can you justify it
when motherboards all pretty much
perform the same if you look at pure CPU
or video card benchmarks well for one
thing it looks better with gigabytes
signature matte black PCB and vibrant
green accent g1 series color scheme and
for another it has more features than
most other fm2 plus boards some that on
the Intel motherboard side of things
you'd have to spend another 40 bucks on
a g1 snipers and 5s if you wanted to get
more on those later though first we'll
do what's included in the box and a
physical tour of the board so inside you
find an i/o shield for SATA cables and a
manual that's it for the board at its
heart we find an FM 2 plus socket with
support for the latest AMD Kaveri
ap use and last generation FM 2 based ap
use as well
the vrm power delivery and cooling setup
around it is fairly mundane but AMD's
latest CPUs aren't the power hogs that
the old ones were so it's not a concern
at all speaking of power the 8 pin and
24 pin connectors are in their ideal
locations for easy cable management in
most cases and over here we've got four
slots for dual channel ddr3 RAM with
support for up to 24 hundred megahertz
Ram and with support for a MP or XMP
memory profiles the board actually
supports up to 64 gigs of ram with
theoretical 16 gig on buffered dims
front USB 3 is over on the right-hand
edge the years of Southbridge heat sink
down here that covers up your chipset
and you've got SATA 3 ports kind of
positioned around it in a location that
I guess is not really ideal but it's not
bad either because all the ones coming
straight out of the board are going to
be out of the way of a dual slot
graphics card in the bottom slot and
next to it you've only got PCI slots
most PCI cards aren't
long we've also got gigabyte signature
dual BIOS down here with two physical
chips so even if you brick it in the
middle of a flash you are still good to
go and finally you've got two front USB
two connectors to go along with that
front USB three
I'd say the PCI slot layout is actually
very good it's crossfire compatible but
not SLI this board is and you can
install up to two dual slot graphics
cards with two PCIe 1x slots and one PCI
slot left which is a great mix for what
I'd call like an entry-level performance
oriented board the fan headers are
located here here here and here I'm a
little bit disappointed that we don't
have any down at the bottom of the board
but it's your mileage may vary depending
on the layout of your case and now I
think we've got to get into the sound
implementation which actually takes up
most of the space on gigabytes web page
for this board it features a real tech
alc 898 codec which is quite similar to
the alc889a at Tom's Hardware tested
against the $2000 DAC and found it to
perform quite similarly so we can't
criticize their choice of components
here they've also included an isolated
PCB section which has become a popular
method of reducing electrical
interference and on motherboard
manufacturers and it's also designed to
reduce interference with a gold shield
over the audio processor I haven't seen
it demonstrated that these type of
shields provide a tangible benefit but
hey it's there look school can be bad so
there you go stuff you're more likely to
notice in actual use as gigabytes use of
NIT chac√≥n Pro Audio capacitors their
on-board gain switches that allow you to
select either a two and a half X or six
X amplification mode and they're
upgradeable op-amp socket most people
will never use this last feature and
it's not something I really even really
recommend messing around with but if you
want to try out different op amps and
see how they color the output sound then
you've got that flexibility moving up to
the rear i/o we find the gold-plated 7.1
audio ports please note this doesn't
improve audio quality directly but it
can make the port's last longer over
time after many insertions and the last
Audio centric feature on the board which
isn't directly related to the onboard
audio but may be important for folks
using external DAC such as an ode ACK or
a file e 10 and that's a special USB
- connector right here on the back with
gold plating which in itself doesn't
matter at all but more importantly a
separate power source that's designed to
minimize power fluctuate fluctuations
fluctuations on the back we've also got
the usual IO so we've got four USB 2.0
ports in addition to the audio one two
USB 3.0 ports ps2 keyboard mouse combo
port VGA DVI HDMI Gigabit Ethernet and
of course the audio ports as I mentioned
before including optical audio out it
should be noted that onboard graphics is
something special on AMD's latest
platform and over at HDMI 1.4 a
connector with the Kaveri APU installed
the board will support 4k output but
only at 30 Hertz which is still great if
you're looking to set up a media
playback box for your 4k TV and the last
interesting point about the board before
we get into our overclocked performance
test are the things that unfortunately I
can't validate but what I will say is
that if gigabytes ultra-durable 4 +
design does improve the board's
resiliency against high humidity and
electrostatic discharge shots then
that's something you would want on your
board so now without further ado I'm
going to hand this off to Luke who took
this board for a spin to give us an idea
what we can achieve by overclocking both
the CPU and GPU component of a Kaveri
apu can we justify a gaming centric
board on this value optimized platform I
guess we'll find out alright guys if
we're if we're reviewing a graphics card
we review it overclocked and we
recommend that everyone overclocks our
graphics card on the way and shall we
talked about this a lot and everything
but we're not that aggressive about it
with CPUs and there's a reason for that
but with this what we're overclocking is
an APU it is both graphics and processor
in the same thing and we highly suggest
overclocking it and that is why these
numbers are going to be overclocked
we're running the system at 4.4
gigahertz on the processor side on the
graphics side it's running at 900
megahertz and we applied 1.5 to 5 volts
to it to get these numbers I could
probably get that voltage number lower
just I'm preparing for the wine show
right now and don't have a ton of time
as you can see with our star swarm
benchmarks there's a really big
improvement due to being able to
overclock the graphics court that much
it's a really big really big jump over
the stock numbers and then in theif when
we're overclocking memory which is
actually completely different you see
huge dumps again if you combine those
two it's even more overclocking on this
platform is very important
you're buying a Kaveri APU almost at CPU
there if you're buying a Kaveri APU you
need to overclock your platform so that
