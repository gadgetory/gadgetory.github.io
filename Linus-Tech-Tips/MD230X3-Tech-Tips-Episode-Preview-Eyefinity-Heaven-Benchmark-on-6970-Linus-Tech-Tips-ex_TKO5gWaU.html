happens we start the video exactly when
it goes like down to the dungeon but
we've gone our MD to 30 X 3 monitor
setup so that is the monitor setup you
see back there so it's the 3 23 inch
Samsung narrow bezel LCDs on this base I
did a full unboxing as well as a as a
sort of overview of this you know here
I'm just going to start the benchmark
over because this is all the dark scenes
you can't really see anything
so we'll go to like the town and the
ship that's a little bit better so I
showed all the wiring in the back that's
quite complicated but now we've finally
got it set up with our ultimate AMD
machine which I have updated and I've
installed the brand-new 5970 graphics
card so this is a fully Eyefinity
DirectX 11 all that good stuff card it
is the replacement for the 5870 but
faster better stronger more powerful all
that good stuff so we've got that in our
machine that we also did a couple full
tech tips episodes on which has our
finem 2 X 6 1100 T turbo processor it's
got 4 gigs of Corsair Dominator GT
memory Corsair H 70 cooler a X 850 power
supply dual Corsair 40 gig SSDs which
are hiding back there somewhere as well
as an assumed crosshair for formula
motherboard in the Corsair graphite 602
case so it's a very cool machine and you
can see we're running the Heaven
benchmark here right now I actually
don't have a score yet because I'm just
prepping this episode of NCIS tech tips
that's going to focus on the new 69 70
as well as the MD 230 X 3 monitor setup
so it's pretty impressive and here
camera man I'll get out of your way for
a second so what I want you to do is go
in a little bit closer so that the
camera angle is yeah yeah actually
that's perfect is kind of like sitting
in front of it I mean it's a different
experience when these are angled
correctly towards your face and you
cannot looking at it like that's your
peripheral vision and that's your center
vision now remember guys you can also
set this up so that the Mon
years are up this way but the way that I
bolted it together we're going for the
super wide panorama view versus the the
taller less wide panorama view and also
you can adjust the the hinges here so if
you don't want the monitor facing in
towards you then you can also just make
the whole thing flat if you prefer that
although it's not going to look as good
because if that's flat you'll you'll
find that the most games will actually
kind of stretch this image a little bit
so that it makes more sense out of your
peripheral vision so if you put it
flattened and it'll look kind of weird
because really what's right here is
actually beside you so it's a lot closer
to you then you know the wall in front
of you in all likelihood so it'll it'll
look weird if you don't if you don't do
it like this so that's pretty much it
I'm just showing you guys sort of some
of the some of the prep work I'm doing
for this episode and don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips NCIX comm
both of my channels for more cool videos
about this sort of good stuff now I
should also mention while it's probably
not ideal for gamers there is a six
monitor version some people commented on
the unboxing video for this Kyle can you
can you stack two of them you can't but
there is a six monitor SKU that comes
preset up to do six panels so it looks
like this the stand is a little bit
taller but it's otherwise the same panel
so you just have double the number of
them and check out the wiring at the
back of it because I showed you guys the
wiring on the back of this one well I
gets even more complicated when you're
looking at six panels instead of a--
instead of three panels so yeah it's not
cheap but I guess you got to pay to play
for for this kind of fun is kind of
product and actually our Heaven
benchmark is finished running so you can
see here with a single 69 70 at stocks
beads with the actually here well you
can see my full system configuration
here as well as all of my settings we
get twenty four point three frames per
second which is pretty darn impressive
for a single card
this kind of resolution that is triple
HD resolution very cool
