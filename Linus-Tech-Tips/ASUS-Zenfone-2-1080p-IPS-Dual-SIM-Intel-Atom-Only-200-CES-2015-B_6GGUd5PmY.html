brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so a soos isn't exactly known
for their you know phones they've done
really well with tablets in the past but
phones have somehow eluded them I mean
we've checked out some stuff that we
thought is pretty cool but nothing's
really knocked our socks off this might
be the one that changes all that and
they are extremely proud of the zenfone
2 and I think for a good reason in terms
of CPU you're looking at an Intel
Moorefield Atom Z and I'm just gonna
cheat here because their product naming
scheme is indecipherable Z 2032 58 quad
core processor running at a nominal 1.8
in boost of 2.3 gigahertz so that is a
quad core it's got 2 gigs of ram it's
got a 1080p display 16 gigs of on-board
storage that's an IPS display by the way
so viewing angles brightness and color
vibrancy are outstanding it's got
wireless AC it's got bluetooth 4.0 it
has a 3000 milliamp hour battery which
isn't quite you know the endurance
master that something like a droid turbo
would be but it's certainly better than
we saw even in flagship phones from the
last generation it supports quick
charging so it'll get up to 60% battery
in 39 minutes was it 39 minutes and what
else can we really say about okay
they've got their they've worked on
their camera technology I'm not quite
sold on it trying it out here in the
suite necessarily but there are a couple
of cool things that it does they've done
a lot of work on backlit subjects with
HDR as well as extremely low light so
even compared to the iPhone 6 where we
did a side-by-side test in their little
complete darkness
owl vision box thing here it actually
managed to find a little bit of color in
the butterfly inside whereas the iPhone
6 did not and I think that's pretty much
it oh yeah it's a 5 and a half inch
display now is the kicker so we started
talking pricing and they said well this
is the 2gig RAM model with a 1080p
display and I kind of went ok so there's
a four gig RAM model with the 1080p
display that one will cost more and then
there is a 720p display model that one
will cost less this one available in
five different colors red white as Miam
black sheer gold Dena they got a name it
something more interesting than just a
gold red white black and gray or
something along those lines
and they kind of said okay so this one
is $1.99 and I kind of went okay cool
what carriers are you launching with and
they go what do you mean carriers it's
sinless it's unlocked it's $1.99 for
this phone not only that but it supports
dual SIM so you pop off the back you can
throw a couple of SIM cards in and it
has microSD expansion this is looking
like one badass phone for $1.99 under
$200 unfortunately they didn't try to do
the whole under $200 it is $200 and it
has blown my socks off so far I'm not
sure how I feel about the non on screen
buttons and you guys will have to decide
which one is for you so the buttons are
haptic feedback buttons below the screen
but man it's light it's feels really
snappy it's running lollipop with with a
Seuss's own skin that doesn't look too
intrusive it doesn't really look like
they've changed a whole lot and I am
really really impressed for the price so
far
speaking of really impressed with the
for the price so far and this has
another trick up their sleeves also a
zenfone product this is called the
zenfone zoom I'm not allowed to pick up
the phone because it's like it was
actually under glass I had to ask very
nicely even to get them to take the
glass off but what this is is they're
saying it's the world's thinnest phone
with a 3x optical zoom so for the folks
you know what I'm just gonna pick it up
what are they gonna do to me for the
folks complaining about the camera bump
on the iPhone 6 this thing's got a bit
of a camera bump but if the idea is you
want to be able to really zoom in and
get much better pictures and take full
advantage of all of them megapixels on
the sensor if you're shooting something
further away this looks like it might be
in I'm not personally sold until I
actually see it in action it's gonna be
priced at 399 with no sim but because
I'm assuming has not proven to me yet
that it's up there with someone like
Samsung or Apple but I'm very excited to
see it once they've actually got 100%
working prototypes and I will be glad to
bring you guys a review of this one once
it is ready
other than that specs are pretty similar
to the zenfone so what you'd be paying
for is really the camera capabilities on
this guy right here so thank you for
watching this video on the zenfone and
the Zen
phone zoom guys remember our trip to the
