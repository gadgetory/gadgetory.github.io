that's actually phenomenally useful and
popular but maybe not as glamorous as
like you know the greatest new video
card or you know CPU or whatever else
this is the blacks black X blackest
because six I don't know this is the
thermal take this 5g it's a hard drive
docking station supporting 2.5 inch and
3.5 inch SATA hard drives SATA up to say
2 3.0 that's SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
with full support for USB 3 super speed
at qatar carries a 3 year warranty and
allows you to and him conveniently
transfer large documents pictures or
movies between our drives and computers
our drive not included moving a lot
we've got a bunch of other stuff which i
don't think is really that interesting
and then over here we've got a bunch of
other stuff about how it's backwards
compatible it comes with a premium
shielded USB 3 cable supports hard
drives up to tune up to 2 terabytes oh
that's gonna fly Thermaltake although we
have some three terabyte drives coming
that we can we can check out soon maybe
it's just one of those things where when
the packaging was done like 2 terabyte
drives were as big as they got you run
into that a lot actually with nasa's
where they'll say supports up to 12
terabytes of storage when the reality of
it is it was just because there wasn't
anything bigger than a 3 terabyte drive
when that nas was originally created and
something else will work just fine so
you actually get a ferret
oh this is cool check this out let's
find an SSD to like put it in that's
like so bawling out so you can be all
like what smart look at this okay so
there's ventilation holes on the back
and then there's a label reader on the
front and when you have a hard drive as
opposed to an SSD the label positioning
will be somewhat more favorable here we
go let's do a hard drive instead of an
SSD okay so you'll be able to see
valuable information like the capacity
BAM just like that ok so it comes to one
of those for a two and a half
and it's also rubber and like you know
shock-resistant up and I'm gonna slam
the drive too hard on the table there
the SSD shock resistant and comes with a
sleeve for a three and a half inch drive
which also doubles as an oven bit please
not use this item as an oven it
you know disclaimer voice right comes
with a USB a to be cable that's a USB
three one so you can see the extra pins
there and the extra pins deeper inside
there comes with a power adapter it
doesn't come with an SSD or a hard drive
according to the Box product warranty
policy okay cool instructions which is
basically like connect the things and
then plug the thing in and then like
creating a partition okay and the black
unit itself so the reason we have one of
these is because we have an upcoming
video about you asp so I don't know if
you guys remember this but asu's current
generation motherboards support you asp
which is an accelerated method of USB
three transfer so it's a different
protocol than the standard USB 3
protocol that allows it to be faster so
we're gonna take a high-end SSD we're
gonna plug it into this enclosure which
uses UE USB 3 / u asp and we're going to
see just how much faster you asp is than
the standard USB 3 transfer rates so
we're going to use the same asus
motherboard to test both transferring
speeds and we are going to just turn you
asp on and off in AI suite in order to
find the difference so the unit itself
is pretty straightforward with like
power button the toggle switch so you
can conveniently easily tell if it's on
or off there's this guy which basically
is just allowing you to easily position
a two and a half inch drive or you can
take that out and I don't think I have
any hard drives lying around actually
I've gone almost completely SSD in like
every part of my life so I no longer
yeah I no longer believe in like three
and a half inch hard drives so uh there
you go but if you have a hard drive you
would be able to plug it in here
I think that pretty much covers it thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the black x5 G maybe
someone can correct me on how to say
that I mean you guys do love correcting
me when I'm saying things whether it's
processor or a soos incidentally both of
which are correct especially a soos but
don't forget to subscribe - ekans for
more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos so slick was like oh I
don't see the point of those rubber
things because anyone clumsy enough to
you know bump their drive against
something probably wouldn't bother to
like put this thing on in the first
place so this is just a warning out
there for everyone if you need to keep
your data practice safe data storage use
