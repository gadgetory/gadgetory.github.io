D FX haptic feedback gaming system from
immers this is the first haptic feedback
vest I have tried extensively and I'm
super excited as I love devices that
increase immersion immers has some
pretty heavy claims about this device
even going out of their way to include a
safety note stating that the core FX
generates powerful emotional and
physical effects well mark me down is
scared and excited for more exciting
review stay subscribed align effectives
of course rhx 1,200 i power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet performance and corsair link
digital advanced monitoring and control
click now to learn more first things
first
physical overview you have little
pouches for holding various electronics
and speakers along with included the for
battery slots 2 by 2 by the way
batteries themselves are not included in
the middle of the chest piece you have a
removable velcro pad so you can put
something like your clan logo and behind
that you have the two vibrating
transducers the yellow buttons on the
right side of the chest piece control
the amplitude of the transducers so
essentially your intensity the buttons
on the left side are power which is
pretty self-explanatory bind which will
bind your chest piece to the control box
and mode which will use or change
between three different modes or filters
the first filter is the least inclusive
and involves the lows like deep bass the
second filter also includes lows from
the first filter but also now includes
the mid range filter 3 is as you guessed
it an all-encompassing filter which
includes lows mids and highs to explain
that the core FX functions by receiving
audio from your computer that little
control box acts as an in-between so you
have a line in and a line out that would
go to your headphones or speakers and
then depending on the sound that comes
into the line in the core FX will then
vibrate I'm not going to go super
in-depth on how to set all that up or
setting up other various things because
the core FX crew actually has some quite
good videos on how to get yourself going
in various different setups you can
check for those at core FX comm slash
start with the help of those videos and
some well spent time you should be able
to get this unit running very nicely
very quickly the control box is a little
lackluster in the way that it has no
rubber or feet on the bottom and will
likely just slide around your desk
especially because it is so freakin
light the box
Roo features a line in and line in
volume a plug for USB mini-b to deliver
power line out line out volume and a
power switch and a bind button to bind
to the vest before we move on I must
make a note about the cables they
are really short and at first I was
quite worried about this but in use I
didn't actually find it to be that bad
as the unit wirelessly connects to the
vest so this little box and just live
near the back of my computer where all
my plugs are anyways although it's
something to take note on depending on
your setup in wearability terms it
wasn't that bad its size and adjustment
abilities kind of allow it to fit on a
very wide variety of body types but I
really would have preferred it if the
form factor was something like an actual
tactical vest and not reminiscent of a
sports bra this would make the unit feel
much more real for the immersion people
out there and would allow them to have
more transducers speaking of transducers
or lack thereof how does this thing
perform well not that great
unfortunately as expected vibrations
from the transducers are weak and the
fact that there are only two of them and
they both happen to sit right kinda on
either side of my chest is a little
sucky their positioning and the lack of
any other transducers doesn't help with
immersion anytime the legendary scenario
of a grenade going off near me would
happen I would just be too distracted by
the fact that apparently the grenade
only had an effect on my inner pecs to
really appreciate the shrapnel Riddle
death that I just endured I want
something with hoof I want something
that actually makes me feel like I'm in
the moment which is also a problem
because of how the unit operates basing
the vibrations solely off of sound makes
it really fun to listen a dubstep and
maybe some metal but rather distracting
in most games for shooters you get
vibration every time you shoot which
makes sense because of recoil but as
little odd because yet again it's in the
middle of your chest not your arms or
your shoulders if someone happens to
talk with a deep growly voice your vest
will probably vibrate if you're playing
a game with background combat noise like
battlefield your vest will vibrate a lot
if you're playing a racing game it
doesn't feel like you're racing it feels
like you're enduring the world's worst
chest massage
so in conclusion at 150 dollars the core
FX vest isn't for me it doesn't feel
like an actual vest I would wear the
vibrations feel inconsequential and
largely end up getting ignored
especially because of the vest vibrating
at all the wrong
to be fair though I don't actually want
to rag on a MERS I walked into this
review really hoping this thing would be
awesome and it just unfortunately was
not but I do think there is a market for
high quality gaming vests especially
with consumer VR right around the corner
the thing is though that we really need
a lot more force in the feedback of
better overall vest construction so that
it feels real a better logical system
for when the vest should trigger which
will probably require developer support
so won't even be supported in that many
games
unfortunately that being said that ideal
vests that I just described would be
really expensive the the cost of working
with developers the cost of more
physical material because there have to
be a bigger vest the cost of a better
way to interpret explosions and stuff so
you can actually feel them more
transducers better transducers all that
kind of stuff is going to cost more that
vest could easily be five or six hundred
bucks and then people probably wouldn't
buy it anyways so I don't know so what
do you guys think am I wrong is it
awesome let me know in the comments down
below
over on the forum while you're still
here comment that my opinion sucks and
this thing is amazing and that you
really like the color of the vest
because it's black in orange and that's
our colors I just noticed that now
