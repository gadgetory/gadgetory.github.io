i'm going to be unboxing the pier buds
so these are a pretty unique set of
earbuds that feature reverse sound
technology and reverse sound technology
sounded pretty stupid to me at first
because i was like well is it kind of
like when you look at a picture and they
invert the colors and it just doesn't
sound right or what so know what reverse
sound technology means is that instead
of blasting the sound or music or a
movie or whatever the case may be
directly into your ear canal it actually
projects the sound out away from your
ears so that it doesn't feel as as sharp
and potentially painful so it should be
a more comfortable listening experience
and also reduce the risk of your damage
so there you go here we have a couple
pieces of documentation that are
included one of them is a limited
warranty for a period of one year thank
you very much okay next we have thank
you for buying these you no longer have
to choose between amazing sound and safe
volume we have come with three different
earbud tips okay so one is more oriented
for surround sound so I don't know how
well that works but obviously we'll have
to give it a try to find out but
basically what that would be attempting
to do is make the sound come from
outside your ear as much as possible
okay so we have bass boost brings you
the thumping bass you normally only get
by strapping a subwoofer to the side of
your head okay full range and this would
be sort of your all around all around
guy so brought to you by amazing tech
products inc
alright let's have a look at the
purebloods themselves come in a little
protective case has some kind of residue
on it but it's probably all good okay
comes with all of the the tips that it
did mention so here's the surround tip
so you can see there's a pass through
hole right in the middle because the
sound does get projected away from your
ear so basically what that one's doing
is it's just creating um like a buffer
between the speaker and the noise coming
into your ear from all around
interesting so here we have the white
corded pier buds
alright the earbuds themselves come in a
little plastic thing
so here you go so the speaker actually
fires supposedly this way you know what
let me cheat i'm going to check out my
little PDF where it has all the details
about it i can show you okay so
frequently asked questions are the self
innovate
yeah reverse sound technology leads to
unique and safer way to enjoy audio just
leave ah blah blah okay what is reversed
on technology yeah okay so here here's a
little blown up diagram of the pyramids
themselves
so here you go the main body so the
speaker is actually on this side covered
by a cover then there's a protector and
a rubber ring alright so the speaker
fires that way okay so that's reverse
sound technology I just wanted to make
sure that I was describing that as well
as I possibly could I think that's
pretty much it okay so we've got
impedance is 16 16 ohms plus or minus
fifteen percent in case anyone cares
about that and the rated input power is
to milliwatts okay so now let's have a
look at what they look like when they're
installed
they don't really isolate any sound and
I wouldn't I wouldn't really expect them
to if the way that they work is that
they fired the sound out away from your
ears and then expect you to still be
able to hear anything
sounds kind of like earbuds to me so far
but thank you for checking out my
unboxing the earbuds don't forget to
