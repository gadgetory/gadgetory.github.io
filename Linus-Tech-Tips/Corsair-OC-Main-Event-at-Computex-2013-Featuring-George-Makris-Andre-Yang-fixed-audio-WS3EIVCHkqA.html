alright guys I'm here at the Coursera
Intel overclocking event with George and
just maybe tell us what's going off the
leaderboard here alright well we got a
leaderboard that's going to be tracking
the guys who set the various different
records or try and break the record for
the day so at the top of it the number
one prize is SuperPi 32mm all the way
down to you know stuff like 3d mark
first fire strike the Asus team here
with Andre and TL actually just set our
personal daily record on the CPU
overclock they have six point seven five
so far and they got the super pi 1m
number which is a thousand-dollar award
they got that down to five point 41
which is our current fastest speed but
you know the events have been going on
for less than an hour so we expect maybe
some guys could break that number maybe
these doesn't break that number in a
little bit so we're pretty excited these
guys are dumping liquid nitrogen all
over the place they're you know putting
Vaseline on motherboards and rubbing
shop towels on things
this is dangerous and freaky stuff and
these guys are professionals I wouldn't
practice this time and they were
wondering at what negative 135 was that
there are a negative 134 degrees Celsius
so I've joined the rest of the team at
the overclocking event and George what
is this this is the leaderboard that
shows who's currently in the lead of
each specific score we're doing we're
given 11 different prizes away today
starting at a thousand bucks and went up
to $5,000 for the prize total of $20,000
of prize money the the most the highest
price of grand prize is the super pi32
mag which is to you know see how fast
the system can run a 32 megabytes super
pie calculation or 32 million sorry
super pie calculation that's a $5,000
prize now the guys up there eight pack
lead that right below them on the hassle
memory frequency where they're at 37 82
which is almost thirty eight hundred
megahertz on the memory frequency it was
way beyond Ivy Bridge which was around
33 34 so those guys knocked that out of
the park and then underneath that we're
6.9 gigahertz on the processor
overclocking record too so there's the
top three records then underneath that
you can see that Andre and teammates use
their have basically dominated all the
other stuff SuperPi 1 million the
calculation in PI fast W prime 32 all
that stuff so tell me about the strategy
why is it that Andre and teammate soos
seem to be going after everything but
the big prize pool is up there what is
the deal like because there were some
stipulations in terms of what hardware
you could bring or what you couldn't
bring and what's their strategy I think
I mean you'd have to ask them
specifically for their strategy my guess
is that they looked at it and said look
we know we can knock this one we can
knock this one we can knock this one and
I said you know makes more sense to take
Awards four through nine and I take two
take only one two and three there was a
lot of competition there still is a lot
of competition going on right now we got
about 20 minutes left for the first and
second and third spots I think they said
look I don't think there's going to be
as many guys fighting here we're gonna
go full bore for it and they hit some
really impressive numbers the pie fast
number 9 23 is really close to a world
record and on day one of the eye of the
Haswell launch I mean that's that's
incredible there's a year and a half of
stuff from Ivy Bridge and these guys are
almost breaking it in one day so Howell
is a really impressive launch already
well that's fantastic I mean so I don't
believe everything you heard about
Haswell overclocking so we're gonna be
following this up with a little bit more
coverage once
it's time to actually present the awards
I had something else I wanted to talk to
George about because really these these
overclocking events it takes a long time
to dial in an overclock you got to do
some testing on it every time you change
any any freaking thing but what tends to
happen is we're still 20 minutes from
the end this is where things get really
exciting
tell me about sandbagging san breaking
is basically you you go and you put up a
number that's okay and other guys are
like well whatever that's fine and a lot
of guys wait till the very end to throw
their numbers up because they kind of
want to see what the other guys are
really doing so what you're gonna see
here like for example a lot of the guys
waited till the end to do the 3d stuff
the bottom ones a benchmark for a 3d
mark and aqua mark and stuff like that
so I'm gonna guess it does bottom four
benchmarks you're gonna see those change
like every five minutes from here to the
end of the competition and I think a lot
of guys did wait to hit their best
possible video card numbers because in
the open category where they're allowed
to bring whatever graphics card they
want they already know what they're
capable of doing they got their liquid
nitrogen they're ready to go they know
they can do it at home so if they see
the number here that they're actually
able to beat they're not gonna beat it
until they have to if they can beat it
with two minutes left that doesn't give
their competition much time to beat them
very very exciting so back back with
awards actually this time thanks again
George no problem alright I'll try not
to do this to you too many times thanks
George
not a problem actually finally a word
ceremony time here guys
I'm just gonna see if I can sort of
cheat he's kind of chucked my mic in
here and see if that works so I haven't
asked anyone his permission to do that
it's gonna kind of sneak over here kind
of subtly okay competitions today
where whether we're eight benchmarks
that running in the hundred days long
and they're possibly one team ran only
to those benchmarks and we thought and
that's Andre and TL so if they could
step up on the stage
yeah guys actually get eight trophies
I'm not sure what you're gonna do it
longer
I could take a couple of them if you
want
so they actually need a crew of ladies
to carry all of their trophies for them
so congratulations these guys was very
impressive winning all those been close
I played the brand promise which is sort
of a combination of CPU and memory
frequency is the super high score and
the winners of super high at 4 minutes
29 seconds well I hope you guys have
enjoyed the corsair overclocking event
