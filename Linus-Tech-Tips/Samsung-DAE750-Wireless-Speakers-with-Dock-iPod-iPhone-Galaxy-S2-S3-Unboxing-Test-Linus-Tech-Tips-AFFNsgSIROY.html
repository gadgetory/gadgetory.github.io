something pretty cool here today this is
the Samsung Dae 750 wireless audio with
dock so it's not necessarily a wireless
audio dock because it's a wireless audio
device that also happens to have a dock
it is compatible with Apple airplay as
well as Bluetooth for Android devices so
you can even use Samsung's AllShare
technology in order to play whatever
music you want and with a custom Samsung
app it can even remember things like
where you were in your last song before
you got a call and resume right where
you left off so let's start with what
they have to say for themselves on the
outside of the box this includes yes a
tube amp a vacuum tube ant is built-in
so it's not cheap it's about $700
so it better deliver you know a pretty
decent amplifier and some pretty decent
speakers for that price but I think
Samsung feels they've really hit the
nail on the head as far as that's
concerned compatible with all your iOS
devices
there's your airplay logo you've got
your Bluetooth it is also of course
fully networking capable so it is Wi-Fi
ready and you can also plug in Ethernet
to get it connected to your network as
well plays Windows media okay I didn't
say anything about that on on any of
Samsung's documentation but there you go
it has a built-in subwoofer it is dual
docking so it's compatible with Samsung
Galaxy s2 galaxy s3 galaxy note as well
as iPhone and well iPhone iPod I suppose
would also work moving right along
wireless streaming in high quality so
yeah it uses an app decks codec in order
to enable the stream to be higher
quality and this is pretty much all the
same stuff and okay
and that's pretty much it so let's open
it up because one of the big things
about this device is that it is
absolutely beautiful is it necessarily
the best audio quality you can buy for
$700 no and that's fine because the best
audio you can buy for $700 is
usually some kind of like weird-looking
thing that sounds really great and it's
like this niche brand that doesn't seem
to understand that you have to actually
put the thing in your living room where
people will see it
Samsung it kind of gets that on a count
if they make like TVs which are pretty
much the centerpiece of the modern
living room whether you sort of like
that or not and I would love to be able
to get this out of here oh my goodness
it's really heavy okay
whoa give me a sec guys I'm gonna make
you guys sit through the accessories
before we actually take this leave off
it because I'm really excited to see how
the unit looks now I've heard talk of
the finish on it but I haven't seen it
in person yet here we've got one of
those filters for your power cable we've
got the remote the remote which actually
looks surprisingly like a small iPod
touch except with a brown back the
remote kind of cheeseball
but the reality of it is this is
designed to be controlled by your tablet
or your smartphone
99% of the time so I wouldn't worry too
much about the remote in fact I can't
think of a good reason why you'd even
dock a device to it unless it's just an
iPod Touch that you have for the sole
purpose of keeping it docked to your to
your iPod dock and you want it to
continue to charge that's the only
reason I would do it other than that I'd
just be using airplay or I'd be using
bluetooth or I'd be using AllShare or
some other wireless device I comes with
an auxilary jack and comes with an
auxilary cable in case you want one of
those power cable and Ethernet cable
because you do want this to be connected
to your home network and let's go ahead
and unveil this cherrywood finished
living room centerpiece all yeah there
we go that's what I'm talking about
check this out
so let's do a quick overview of the
outside of the yeah you know what camera
man's got in here actually oh yes we
have a special guest for today's
unboxing the legendary NCIX camera man
is
back it's not slick today so yeah there
you go so let's start with the speakers
at the front so there you've got your
mid speakers your tweeters and a
subwoofer built right into the bottom so
that means that you've got all the
ranges covered with dedicated speakers
most Doc's aren't doing that most docks
costs less than $700 but if you're going
to get a premium one you might as well
get one that's got the actual means to
deliver all the different ranges of
sound that you want there are your
vacuum tubes
so most amplifiers these days are done
with op amps they are amplified Mellark
most amplifiers these days are digital
they are not using analog amplification
so if you have a high-quality amp built
into a device such as this one what
you're going to want to do is stream the
audio or transmit the audio to it
however you do it at the lowest possible
volume you want to rely on your you know
iPhone as little as possible to amplify
the sound and rely on this tube amp in
order to do it for you so at the front
yeah there's not much there other than
four speakers and a Samsung logo at the
top you got this you've also got
controls on the top so you've got your
play volume up volume down as well as
the F button whatever whatever that does
that's good like angry button ah F there
we go don't worry we'll figure out what
that does at some point we'll update you
so there's the porting for the subwoofer
right there here we've got the dual
docking capable dock so I can throw an
iPhone on there or if I had a USB device
such as Excel ik c s2 s3 or samsung note
galaxy note rather I could put it on
there as well all your connectivity it's
back here so there's your Ethernet USB
WPS setup I'm going to go ahead and
remove the sticker on here that's making
it look kind of brutal
ah there we go that's more like it
auxiliary in only for service wow that's
very clearly labeled and your power so
oh oh this is all this is brilliant
cameraman wasn't sure why it had a USB
port on the back and now it's become
obvious to me if you don't have an
iPhone and you don't have a guy
see device you can plug in your USB here
plug your auxiliary in here and you can
run any device off of it
for as long as you want you just kind of
hide it sort of you know under here or
something and nobody ever has to see it
so it can remain you know just looking
like this and not have anything wrecking
the look at it so if you want to check
this thing out actually you can go to
the NCIX Aberdeen store and hear it in
person and I think that pretty much
covers what I want to see you know I'll
be back with a couple more details so
we've got camera man's iPhone docked on
there now there's a couple more things I
did want to cover so the speakers are
using glass fibre construction with a
phase plug design also you can play
music directly off a USB stick which is
kind of cool and one of the other things
I did want to say is you can connect
using bluetooth more than one device at
a time so you can actually rather than
having to manage a bunch of different
docks on a bunch of different devices
that are just for that dock you can
actually connect things however you want
whenever you want and I think that's
kind of cool now cameraman and I weren't
particularly enthralled with the sound I
mean
tube amps do have a bit of a warm sound
and it's not to everyone's tastes and
the lack of an equalizer built into the
device it might be a bit of a challenge
for some users however if you know you
like the tube amp sound and you do want
something that is an absolutely
beautiful looking device dock then I
guess you could do a whole lot worse
than the DA 750 thank you for checking
out this unboxing your first look on -
tech tips and don't forget to subscribe
and cameraman figured out what the f
stands for F is for function it's on the
remote as well see F for function so
that actually changes the input so here
I can change it back to back to the
iPhone and I could potentially play
music again there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
