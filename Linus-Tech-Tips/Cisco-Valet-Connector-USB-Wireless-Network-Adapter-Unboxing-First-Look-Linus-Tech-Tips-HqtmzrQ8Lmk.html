the valley connector and I'm gonna start
with the unboxing right away because
there's actually not a great deal to say
about it because what this is is
basically a USB wireless adapter okay
but what's interesting about the valley
connector is how simple it is to use so
I'm actually going to be following this
up with a video showing the valley
connector as well as a valet router and
I'm going to show you guys what steps
are involved in connecting the valet but
obviously in order to do that I had to
open up the boxes at some point so here
I am opening up the box so you can
connect your laptop to a hotspot at a
coffee shop hotels and airports okay so
it's pretty much what a wireless adapter
does thank you for that Cisco and then
it is a wireless n certified okay also
good to know it is a wireless USB
adapter for desktop okay laptop PCs
excellent and award-winning 24/7
customer support well that's a good
thing to have all right
so let's see here are the instructions
one insert the valley connector into a
USB port on your computer to click set
up your Cisco Valley connector neat
three follow the on-screen instructions
to install your valley connector is that
it okay well let's see what there is in
terms of accessories so first we have
welcome to the new home wireless
experience connect play work liya live
smarter and get started okay so to get
started you just plug the valley
connector into your computer interesting
and then in here oh just a couple things
so basically we've just got the valley
connector itself and a USB extension
cable as well as a cap for the valley
connector should you wish to take it off
and put the cap on it oh I dropped it
that's a bad thing okay so this is I'm
not really weighted it has a bit of a
fuzzy foamy base okay so that sits
wherever you happen to put it it's just
a USB extension cable basically and this
is the valley connector itself so
there's a USB port there's a little
serial number mac address looks pretty
much like any USB key so it's going to
come down to the software how easy is it
to use is it as great as cisco says it
is or
stay tuned to find out and also stay
tuned for the unboxing of the valet
router that goes with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
