show of 2018 and uh the last window the
last man show of this week where see yes
there we go I forgot what was important
yes is gonna happen soon yeah that's
that's I'm gonna blame my mind
scattering on that so who's all going
cuz this is your first year it's my
first year it's gonna be Alex's first
year Alex the gray dish yeah it's gonna
be Jake's first time away from home yes
away from the nest
his mom's driving him to the airport but
after that he's a free man
I'm gonna give her a wink in the parking
lot there oh yeah knowing smile and that
so so you Alex Jake max yeah and then I
think that's everyone who hasn't been
I'm not sure if pelo was there Lassie or
not he's been around there's gonna be a
pack of us though hey Brandon lookout
was Pella at CES last year yeah yeah
okay so it's out so it's all just
writers who weren't there last year well
and Max cool that was almost here all
right all right
okay so that's that's what's going on
and see yes that's gonna be next week
expect a huge torrent of videos to be
hitting YouTube and floatplane it's
gonna be insane bunch of stuff coming
excited and stressed you should be
already it's a pretty insane experience
a performance anxiety on the one hand
I'm so stoked because as a kid I
subscribed to Xbox Magazine and they're
always talking about going to e3 yeah
it's totally different sure but I never
thought that I'd go to any yes giant
complex like that and see all this
cutting-edge stuff face up yes is more
more insanity in terms of like let's
OOTS me the people on the floor where
you need to go so III is nicely
contained in one building and it they're
like super way more hardcore or at least
they were they've loosened it up a
little bit but who could go so there
wasn't a ton of people on the floor and
it's all in one building this is well
early in the earlier day it's like in
the early 2000s it was less yes yes
tighten it up yeah you should grow your
beard longer you have so much more
wisdom than I do in our ears are the
same length
make any sense but yeah CES is gonna be
insane
I'll be at CES with a mustache no wisdom
[Laughter]
either way what we're gonna talk about
this week is a lot of Intel stuff a lot
of arm stuff a lot of Andy stuff as you
guys know CPUs right now are in kind of
a terrible spot with meltdown and
Specter are both going around rampaging
things we're all talked about we're
talking about what different companies
are doing to deal with this how it's
being dealt with how it might affect you
how it's affecting other companies
different responses that are happening
due to it
all that kind of stuff let's talk about
all that kind of stuff and there's a
bunch of other interesting things as
well
like some stuff to do with Spotify and
Luke's super-secret New Year's
resolution yeah well the intro for
dramatic effect
now I made that last bit up you got a
few minutes to think aside
eat about as much sugar as I usually do
for making this show viable moving back
okay
let's get into it I'm gonna post an ARS
technica thread it was or a post an
article article there we go we'll go
with that it's posted by Peter bright
it's a very good article thank you Peter
bright for making a very nice concise
package this is everything that's going
on it's way too long most people aren't
going to read it grab a coffee and a
doughnut to go through it kind of
article there's a lot of information
this whole story is like an onion layers
yeah so we're gonna take you through the
entire story of how these
vulnerabilities were discovered the what
the response from the parties involved
was and kind of all the insanity that
has ensued and it's still in something
today yes so I'm gonna jump slightly
forward and explain what they are and
then we'll jump back to the start and
explain how it was founded all that kind
of stuff okay that's okay jump around a
little bit it's gonna be crazy tangent
so I'm gonna steal some of this from Ars
Technica again thank you very much Peter
bright melt so there's two main
vulnerabilities and they're kind of
related they are kind of related they
they source from the same type of area
so jumping to the ARS article modern
processors performs speculative
execution that's where a lot of this is
based on that is where a processor will
assume what needs to be done next and do
that thing and do those calculations and
then if it is wrong and that isn't
what's happening next
that is fine it doesn't matter it
ditches all that code no big deal if
it's right then hey it's already done it
and it's able to execute that thing
faster this is a great thing
it makes things run a lot faster it's
not a big deal that it's running some
code and coming up with some answers and
then ditching those answers because it's
making a lot of other things faster when
it does guess correctly pretty much only
upside this is the property of modern
CPUs yes that would be a reason why no
spoiler alerts
these these vulnerabilities don't really
have as much of an impact on older much
older chips yeah so specter and meltdown
that we're gonna be talking about today
are it perturbs the processors state in
detectable ways which is bad that
essentially when you break that down
means that these vulnerabilities can
watch even though it doesn't have access
to these code paths the speculative
execution code paths it can figure out
what they're doing which is bad because
it gives them more information and it
could result in more things down the
line
meltdown inspectors what we know of
right now so again to break down what
meltdown inspector our meltdown it's
applicable to every Intel chip made for
many years I don't think we know
necessarily right now actually is a list
yeah I should show the list I don't
entirely know if the list is don't
believe my list oh we didn't do screen
share we have an HDMI like the classic
meme of wind show which is it's late
screen sharing has never stopped
prepared an audio doesn't work
yes except what screen is that that's
awesome hold on anyways there is a list
I can post it in the twitch chat so you
guys can check it out yourselves suffice
to say it's basically every Intel chip
for the last 15 years yeah it's kind of
a big deal and it's going to affect
different chips in different ways which
is another interesting part newer chips
have certain standards which will
actually help them deal with this a
little bit better than certain older
chips it also affects different programs
differently so certain programs are
gonna get hit by this really heavily
Microsoft has found I will go into that
more later but Microsoft has found that
certain anti viruses have been using
things in undocumented ways that utilize
this type of stuff so when they try to
turn it off again we're gonna get into
that more later I'm trying to be vague
because we'll go more deeply into that
later it causes problems for the
antivirus programs which is a nightmare
but any
it's all it's all a whole mess but only
a verbal Table of Contents meltdown
after one applicable to every Intel chip
for many years listed in the twitch chat
and will be in the dock if you access
the forum so if you're watching this on
youtube or you're listening to this on
soundcloud which a few people do it does
actually happen
some people do listen to this on
soundcloud you can go into the
description and there will be a forum
link if you go to that that'll show the
dock and in the dock there will be a
link with all capital letters that says
list of affected Intel CPUs anyways
moving on every Intel chip for many
years along with certain high
performance arm designs only high
performance arm designs this flawed
depends on the way that operating
systems share memory between user
programs and the kernel and the solution
right now carries some performance
penalty in certain cases really brutal
ones I believe the highest reporter that
I've seen is about 30% yeah but I think
that's more anonymous it's usually
that's usually especially if it been
newer CPU it's about 5% yeah yeah it's
not very rarely that bad it's also only
certain processes and programs that are
gonna get affected by it and it's also
less as impactful if you have near chips
and it's gonna depend what you're doing
- I've heard in gaming it can be it can
result in like three frames per second
yeah yes yeah but it really is going to
depend but the the answer to this is to
put an end to that sharing of memory
between user programs and the kernel
which is why there's that performance
penalty and then Specter it's applicable
to chips from Intel AMD and arm this is
where some of the confusion came in that
we're gonna talk about soon where AMD
didn't think they were susceptible to
anything and then now it's just Intel
susceptible to more stuff and everyone's
susceptible to something that each
company is trying to minimize what are
the yeah like AMD said this is a near
zero chance of affecting us and in Intel
doesn't want their stock to drop so
they're saying is it it does affect you
yeah yeah it's a lot of politics
involved as well
there's a huge amount of politics in
this we'll get into that a little bit
more in the future yeah it even says
Intel AMD arm and probably every other
processor on the market that offers
speculative execution which is like all
of them it's also more subtle it
encompasses a trick testing array bounds
to read memory within single processes
which can be used to attack the
integrity of virtual machines and
sandboxes which is rough that's a big
deal for the cloud yeah and and cross
process attacks using processors branch
predictors which is the thing that I was
mentioning earlier where I can take
little bits of resulting information to
figure out what it was actually doing
fixes for some aspects of Spectre appear
to have been developed already but
protecting against the whole range of
fixes will require modification or at
least recompilation of at risk programs
and that is also a very rough part
because that brings way more players
into the space because now you're
talking about programs to so I think
it's fair to say that the only true
fixes new chip architecture
it's one it depends what we're talking
about
unfortunately the sketchy one that
requires the most amount of tinkerer
level fixing for the most amount of
people is Spectre which affects
everybody everybody that has Beck you
ative processing which so that's that's
really annoying but you can on a single
system know that you're okay if you go
through like everything make sure
everything has been modified or
recompiled that is affected by this
make sure your OS level is happy all
that kind of stuff
turn on Windows updates guys at least
yeah it's this this it's it's it's kind
of a nightmare so how did this first get
discovered you want to jump us there but
I can clarify some things because you
know okay so the way this was discovered
was through Google project zero project
zero is one of those little Google
subsidiaries that has a specific task
their task is to find what are called
zero day bugs or vulnerabilities that's
where the zero from project zero comes
from that's right so basically you're
finding a bug as soon as you can fast as
you can and fixing it as soon as it's
found so the way this works is there are
bug bounties a certain amount of money
put up if bugs are found
so all these freelancers Joe schmo's
hackers white hats around the world are
actively searching for bugs among the
suite of software and hardware that is
on project zeros list so a company can
say we're on your list we want your
freelancers to find bugs for us yeah so
a person it's a really cool program
found this vulnerability I believe in
the summer time actually it's been a bit
people have been working on this for a
little while
yeah and they notified Intel at the time
but it's only just become known to the
public this week one quick thing someone
in the chat was like idiot this doesn't
affect iPhones Apple has already issued
a Apple has updated both iOS and Mac OS
to use dual page table mappings I
believe specifically for
or Spectre yeah so it does affect it the
thing is it's such a low-level
vulnerability that if Apple is gonna
patch it they're doing it at a higher
level so they're only gonna be able to
defend from certain aspects of it yeah
well do and there's some nice stuff like
we're jumping around all over the place
I know it's going to be a little bit
hard to follow I would highly recommend
checking out the Rancho doc on the forum
for this reading a few of the different
actual articles that have been properly
posted we're trying to talk live the ARS
article is really good but also with
something like this you should
cross-reference information just to make
sure you're getting everything good so
if this is affecting you or you're
really interested in this I would
definitely recommend diving into it but
people like Amazon with s2 instances are
pushing updates of their own which is
like handling everything on their side
which is really nice but there's that
that's not the case in all situations
but sorry continue
well you continue so when I don't know
that they found moving after that at
universities they made a nice white
paper about it yeah so universities from
America I remember it cuz it's 3a
countries America Austria and Australia
oh no it did this thing randomly when
we're doing the wine show I get signed
out of my Google account and I have to
it's okay I don't actually need it this
second I'll get signed in while I'm
talking it's so much yeah and everything
now hopefully not but yeah universities
from America Australia and Austria and
Google project zero and people working
at Microsoft and Google and Amazon and
all these huge companies all came
together to try to work on this and
they've been working on it actually for
quite a while there's this is where we
get into there's a lot of different
information and it's a little bit
confusing what happened next but the
public figured out and the public
figured out not that long ago the main
article that really blew
in a lot of people's minds because it
was much more public-facing I believe
was the register article register code
at UK which is posted in the land och if
you want to check it out on the forum
that was as far as I know one of the
biggest explosions in terms of more
people knowing there was talk about it
on on more like programmer focused back
channels this was a big news outlet
bringing it on I could be wrong about
that it could have been someone else
first this is the first one I saw saying
and I think it's the first one most
people saw it got to there as far as I
know because a programmer at AMD pushed
code to the Linux kernel let's see here
yeah so there was an embargo on all this
kind of stuff through the Google project
0 platform not everyone agrees with
having embargoes on these types of
things some people position themselves
with like all information should be open
everyone should know everything that's
going on and your opinion on that is
whatever ZZZ but there was an embargo
and it wasn't like technically broken I
don't know you can frame that however
you want but
yeah so it says it's true that AMD
didn't actually reveal the details of
the flaw before the embargo was up but
one of the company's developers came
very close and close enough to infer
what was actually going on an Ambu
developer contributed a Linux patch that
excluded AMD chips from the meltdown
mitigation in the note with the patch
the developer wrote the AMD
microarchitecture does not allow memory
references including speculative
references that access higher privileged
data when running in a lesser privileged
mode when that access would result in a
page fault so with that information
knowing that people are writing code and
it's extremely important having that
basically is like we are not vulnerable
to this and knowing that people are
working on something very major and he's
like excluding themselves from you can
kind of figure out what's going on but
then the guy kind of got murked by us
but wait there's a notice more so as
always to this is where the politics
part comes in because and ok
this is where it gets confusing too
because I have also heard that there was
stuff at Google that was leaked there's
also been some emails that have been
leaked there's been tons of different
stuff I'm not entirely sure which spark
was lit first this is what I read in the
ARS technica article there's other stuff
that I've read who knows anyway it got
exposed to the public at some point and
from there people started freaking the
hell out and that was mostly based
around meltdown that's where we got most
of our information about meltdown which
AMD is essentially as of right now as
far as I know as far as I've seen
published everywhere they're excluded
from that they're fine about that and
that's why there's a bunch of confusion
even when you google this because
there's a timeline here where the first
part of the media wave was everyone
responding to meltdown and saying like
yeah you're gonna read articles let's
say AMD is not affected it'll say that
in bold but it depends when that was
written yeah like the the the register
article which exposed a lot of this
stuff and really started exploding
things like I was saying earlier
specifically says Intel CPU design flaw
then there's another one by the Enquirer
that says Intel arm and AMD all affected
by meltdown and specter security
bypassing CPU design flaw in the
freaking title so who knows because that
one says that AMD is affected by
meltdown but then almost everything else
is saying that AMD isn't affected by
meltdown I'm kind of going with the
isn't side of things but then this is
where it gets political because AMD goes
ha ha ha we're not affected or
everything's fine and then Intel
releases super vague really confusing
details like one of my favorite lines
it's it's in the arse article the
company's initial statement produced on
Wednesday says for example these
exploits do not have the potential to
corrupt modify or delete data which is
great because that is completely not the
point and no one claimed that it did any
of those things that's like
there's another CNBC article somewhere
in the forum linked where it's like this
doesn't affect Nvidia but it's just a
relevant title for all those or AMD
graphics like non techie people who just
bought it Nvidia stock because it was
going gangbusters here yeah thank God
computer stuff we're safe yeah so it's
it's it's confusing for a lot of people
again I highly recommend that you read
these articles but we'll do our best to
go through stuff but anyways that's
where I started getting political
because AMD is trying to sit over here
and be like yes it's not us and then
Intel's respond to that by being like
confusing statements and then I like
that AMD daddy did yeah but then Specter
comes out of nowhere and now it's
everybody everybody's included everyone
who uses speculative processing and not
even just arm Intel and AMD which is all
the ones we largely know but like
basically every chip maker that uses
speculative everything your screen lock
up your daughters and shoot your sons
[Laughter]
yes yeah so I'm gonna talk about what
how affected is the average person here
what can they do about it
cuz I have heard slash read that even
though the vulnerability does affect all
these chips that we all have this isn't
something that you can really exploit
willy-nilly does it take quite a bit of
work to as far as I know it takes quite
a bit of work most random people are not
gonna be targets for this as far as I
know again this is really early on
especially right now and I'm juggling a
lot of different conflicting information
but especially your add depth at
exploiting this right now you're gonna
go for the the highest knowledge sure
see target's not not for Bob swarm as
his battlefield for gaming PC I just
can't look at that name I like it though
it's pretty sweet I think that a gamer
he's got a restaurant oh yeah yeah
swarm oh he gets that all the time yeah
yeah anyways yeah like it's it's very
unlikely that
your personal PC is gonna get attacked
it's very unlikely to tie back to that
dude calling someone an idiot in the
twitch chat that your iPhone is going to
get attacked but essentially all these
processors are susceptible to Spectre
there are updates that are coming
certain programs are going to have to be
recompiled or modified those things are
going to happen especially for major
mainline programs we can look forward to
a lot of blue screens at CES you look
for a lot of updates Windows updates
program updates lots of different things
are going to be updating this is where
we're gonna tie into what different
companies have done arm has released a
really really nice white paper detailing
how it affects their processors and all
this kind of stuff which is gonna be
uninteresting for almost everybody in
this audience because those are for the
most point not consumer level processors
and what I mean by that is not consumer
serviceable processors they're things
like in your phone or in your IOT
devices or all these other kind of
things I doubt that you're running a
desktop setup that has an ARM processor
but you know you might be doing
something weird it's possible you could
plug in your phone if it's possible to
exist yeah it's you could plug in your
phone and use like external keyboards
and do weird stuff yeah it's it's I
doubt anyone watching has that setup but
it is possible
anyways ready for this aspect Oh let's
jump let's jump there and in a quick
moment so so yeah
Apple is already releasing updates for
iOS Mac OS and dealing with some other
crazy things Microsoft is going ham the
Microsoft section of this article is
super long one thing that I really like
that they did Microsoft has already
published a PowerShell script that
describes the current system protection
against meltdown inspector on your
computer so if you're into PowerShell if
you're comfortable with that check out
the ARS article it's linked in the forum
link in the description if you're
watching this on archive if not I've
already posted in twitch chat there you
go and you can check out what's going on
on your own system they're releasing
updates for edge internet explorer
windows itself
mozilla is trying to copy some of mostly
lab mozilla whatever they're trying to
copy some of their approaches to
different things there's tons of stuff
going on microsoft has already updated
its Azur cloud computing platform which
is awesome I would expect that Google
was updated before I even heard about
this Oh they've been on top of this for
a long time yeah
Amazon has already started rolling out
patches for ec2 in terms of meltdown
against specters gonna be weird for all
this kind of stuff I'm mostly talking
about meltdown
Google's to consumer-facing operating
systems Android and Chrome OS both
depend on Linux kernels and that's
already been being worked on as I
mentioned earlier the AMD guy working on
the next kernels and most and but most
Android hardware and most and Android is
a weird thing to think about because
there's a lot of really low-end Android
devices most people don't think about
but is it susceptible to mount meltdown
yet but that's going to change probably
anyways right now it's a huge mess
everything's a mess it's mostly a mess
because it was leaked and when it was
leaked everyone had to scramble super
hard to solve it instead of trying to
take their time and be very coordinated
about everything and buried behind the
scenes and then one day you just get a
Windows Update you don't even know
anything was ever wrong no instead of
that everyone's freaking the hell out
and trying to solve all of this at once
and speaking of how this was very behind
doors for a while Intel CEO sold what is
it like 49 or 24 24 million dollars
worth of stock right so he knew about
this Google told Intel about this in the
summer so the CEO knew that they were
gonna have a fiasco once the public
found out about this he knew the gravity
of the situation and then before this
became public he sold 24 million dollars
worth of his stock in the company which
was a majority I think a majority of
this stock so that doesn't look very
good no but but I think this is actually
kind of click Beatty because
intel says that the stock sale was
unrelated to the vulnerability and came
as part of a planned divestiture program
and those things are things they exist
the other thing is Intel stock price has
only fallen about two bucks
since this Fiasco kind of hit the public
so that's it's not like it tanked and
this is like a huge insider trading
thing granted $2 like with the number of
shares outstanding it's still like
millions of dollars going you're mostly
going from Intel stock right now so it
is look it is huge but I think this is a
little click bTW it's it it really
depends I'm sure there's gonna be legal
oversight into this because like man if
if that was planned without insider
trading and this was just routine
whatever the timing on that yeah oh like
you couldn't be worse in the last huge
amount of years it could could not be
worse timing so it could be an
unfortunate coincidence
I think people claiming that it's
insider are you can't really hammer on
them too hard because there's a lot of
things a lot of red lights going off in
terms of timing in terms of how much it
was twenty four million dollars is quite
a bit of money I also read this is why
this is so confusing I read a number
that was over 40 but like I'm not even
saying it's right because I just read
that like well that actually if this
program it could be multiple phases so
that was the number that went out
recently in December so it could be over
40 like since summer since he's known
maybe sure yeah I don't know yeah it's a
mess but potentially looking into his
legal ramifications for what that might
potentially end up being in terms of
insider trading or not and I'm sure if
it was planned he has tons of
documentation for it and if it goes back
before this bug was released to them
he's going to be fine if it doesn't
that's gonna that's gonna be a little
bit was planning is fine you're probably
not gonna hear about it because no one's
gonna click on that article yeah it just
it's gonna be boring it's not a story
it'll be too boring to bring up on weigh
in show you know it's not boring and
getting sued over this ball they're
super hard yeah there are multiple
lawsuits about one quick second before
we go forward
this article is posted by SC to Mitch on
the forum the previous one was found by
James and the big hole entire thread the
source that we have for that is Doctor
Who 1975 on the forum he's getting the
credit but there actually are like six
I'm sure there's a lot and I'm sure
there's gonna continue to be more thank
you to everybody who's been posting
about this stuff and that's not to say
the duplicate threads there's just so
many yeah there's there's and and
there's conflicting ones and there's
ones that grow on otherwise our forums
happening peut place if you don't go
there you shoes yeah its key yeah the
people who are suing intel do you think
so here's the grounds of at least one of
them okay
the lawsuit this lawsuit particular I
think it was the familiar the first one
Garcia the Intel Corporation filed on
Wednesday January third the suits
plaintiffs a plaintiffs allege that the
computer chips containing the fatal
security flaw well there's a lot of apps
here they violate California and
Tennessee law specifically the plaintiff
spring claims for breach of warranty and
violations of consumer protection
statutes alleging that Intel's selling
of computer chips with this fatal
security flaw mislead consumers about
the performance and reliability of the
computer's operating with this hardware
um my first thought like they have a
quote here saying that they look forward
to holding Intel responsible for
exposing millions of Americans to a
necessary data and security risks our
data risks data security risk that
sounds noble it's like yeah stick him
break him over the coals like someone's
fighting the good fight for us but my
first thought actually when I read this
was like I think these people might be
those like professional sewers yeah
there's also constantly security issues
with this type of stuff it's just
usually handled it's usually much
smaller and it's usually handled much
more quietly like like if you could sue
Microsoft for having a security
vulnerability in Windows Microsoft would
be gone it's just it's obviously because
of the scale
yes scale is why this is a big headline
and a big deal skills hand man to a bull
yeah someone said it's usually handed by
the NSA I have no freaking idea someone
said in the chat he sold them shortly
before ime vulnerabilities became public
in November yeah that's not what we were
talking about though if it was planned
far beforehand if if if he comes in one
day and board of director guys in his or
his financial advisors or whatever the
heck I don't know I'm not into this kind
of money or like hey we should downscale
our stock whatever that thing that you
said it's not gonna happen the next day
it would be planned on paper for a while
it's he's moving a huge amount of stock
it's gonna happen over time yeah anyways
that's about it for that that's we did
it I hope we did it again there's a huge
amount of information if we actually
wanted to go over every single little
tiny bit of it it would take us the
entire show and more if you do want to
know more and if you're into computers
and hardware this is super interesting I
would highly recommend you read more
come up with your own opinions about it
all that kind of stuff check out the
links that will be in the forum dock
thing that i'll be posting that'll be in
the description on youtube and yeah good
idea on youtube and soundcloud and there
we go that's it that's the giant not
just Intel definitely everybody but
mostly Intel and people are trying to
obstacle skate information and some
information is out there and crazy stuff
and no official information completely
entirely yet put your head in the sand
what can you do about it really it's
probably not gonna affect you update
windows live your life yeah am i right
for the most part yeah there is a lot of
minority who's going it's it's it's
definitely affecting some people it's
affecting floatplane and it's it's going
to affect other kind of businesses as
you've seen Google and Amazon and
Microsoft we're all tweaking out right
now yeah anyways and now a word from our
sponsors yeah
yes bug alright
why is there no lower third alright well
there just isn't one how's it going
FreshBooks is the small business
accounting software that you need if you
want to do awesome stuff like like what
run a VPS hosting company or or run to
VPS hosting companies or run a dog
grooming shop or a plumbing company any
any like I know a lot of people in the
audience run small-scale computer
hardware technician service companies I
know I did when I was younger going
around doing small-scale IT work for
some businesses and building computers
for people and doing IT stuff around as
much as I could while I was going to
school because the hours were all nice
and flexible because you're working for
yourself and you can often just remote
into machines and fix them from home and
all that kind of stuff it's great and
you can manage the invoices and finances
that are a nightmare I can tell you from
personal experience are a nightmare if
not if you don't have fresh books you
can generate invoices in an extremely
short period of time you can check if
those people have seen the invoice this
is all super helpful because you don't
want to spend all your time while you
could be studying or working or doing
other more productive things chasing
people down for invoices it does it for
you which is great you can set up online
payments with just a couple clicks which
is awesome and you can get paid up to
four days faster which is super cool so
yeah stop the guessing games get paid
for an unrestricted 30-day free trial go
to FreshBooks comm slash tech tips and
enter Linus tech tips and the how did
you hear about a section freshbooks is
great and moving on if you are doing
what I just said running a small-scale
IT business thing you might want to
bring a laptop somewhere and have that
hooked up and be able to use your laptop
and the other computer all at once or
there's tons of other use cases for this
say you go to work and when you're at
work you work on a laptop I know I was
at the twitch offices we're on twitch
right now is that the twitch offices not
that long ago a lot of people worked on
laptops there you'd be able to pick up
your laptop from work where it's
connected into the monitors and all
nicely hooked up
bring it home put that on a dock or
something like just I have a little
laptop holding arm plug it into power or
whatever and over the network your
keyboard or mouse will connect from your
main computer to your laptop what are
you talking drag-and-drop documents what
business are even talking about energy
you didn't say that yet I did synergy -
synergy - that seems well yeah this is
synergy - not synergy one synergy -
instead of just having all the awesome
stuff that synergy one has and it has as
well with like mouse and keyboard going
from computer to computer like be able
to drag-and-drop files it working over
the network so you don't have to plug
them in through USB or anything you just
have to be on the same network
it also has stuff like cloud bridge so
it can work across VPNs and tricky home
networks if you have a weird set up and
if you get the pro version you get to
access other cool features like
clipboard sharing drag-and-drop files
copy and pasting lock screen sync and
tons more which is great as SSL
encryption which is nice you're not
going to get jacked into all the time
share anywhere automatically control any
computer without reconfiguring which is
really nice one thing that synergy 2 is
apparently a lot better at is detecting
computers which is nice because synergy
was a little bit harder to set up before
I'll show you now yeah so you can go to
this link right here seamless comm slash
synergy slash win 3 specifically that 3
there is important and save 50% when you
do that oh wow really oh yeah not bad
save 50% ok and then last but not least
we have Squarespace we've had
Squarespace for a long time they have
24/7 live chat and email support so if
you're running your little IT business
thing you have synergy you have fresh
books all that is running nicely and you
have your little website advertising
your services and you have troubles with
your site you can call their IT support
or you can you can live chat or email
their live support and it's only 12
bucks a month you get a free domain if
you subscribe for a year which is cool
because domains you you usually rent
them for a year anyways so if you want
the domain for a year you subscribe for
a year they come
it's all nice they have a commerce
module so you can use their free online
store they have cover pages so you can
have one nice beautiful page if you want
that set up or you can even if you want
to have some type of blog or something
like that you can publish content in
Apple news format directly from their
blog module which is cool and if you go
to squarespace.com forward slash LTTE
and use offer code LTT you get 10% off
your first purchase so there you go
someone in the twitch chat it was
scrolled by it was like what are those
glasses you fool
you don't even know your own folly all
right what do you want to talk about now
let's pick one
I believe that Waring yeah no okay
that's great if you have an HP chef an
HP laptop this is me not talking about
this one it might be getting recalled
right now there's a big list of pro
books and Zen books that are getting
recalled because of the battery you can
get a free battery fix from HP if you
send it back in don't bring it to a
third party fixer guy because these
aren't actually supposed to be user
fixable batteries so give it a Google
look it up see if your HP book our
notebook is one of the effective ones
and get that puppy fixed and no reason
to bring it to a third party anyways
because this is a actual recall that HP
is asking you to contact them about so
they should be handling everything yeah
yeah so I wouldn't I wouldn't worry we
don't want to have a note seventh
situation you're just yeah don't have
just send her in yeah yeah that's
probably good idea so next Spotify sure
all right so Spotify they're possibly on
the hook for a one point six billion
dollar copy billion that's a lot of
money why why you might ask
because they've been streaming songs
without giving money or getting consent
from the owners of those songs yeah
pretty much
so it's what's the name of the company
CSUN music publishing yeah they've got
Tom Petty Neil Young and rage against
the machines Tom Morello and many more
so that's some
pretty major names last summer Spotify
faced a suggested 43 million dollar
settlement which is still yet to be
approved in court and they also agreed
to a 30 million dollar settlement with
national music publishers association
and MPA for unpaid royalties in 2016 so
they're just getting stomped got a
license that content bro yeah speaking
of music streaming rumor rumor has it
that YouTube a grown YouTube is gonna
launch a music streaming surface why you
might ask since Google Play services
already heard Google play music already
exists we don't know this would actually
be the alphabet the parent company of
Google and YouTube this will be their
third attempt at at a music service
actually because Google Play Music
launched in 2011 and to my estimation is
doing just fine but on top of that I use
it they had something called yeah I just
switched to it from Spotify actually and
I am digging that algorithm it's pretty
good course the algorithms off yeah of
course why did you think that someone
likes pot if I could beat Google who
owns YouTube YouTube by the way being
the second largest search engine in the
world is better than Bing YouTube's
search engines it's huge their their
algorithm for what to play next it keeps
you on YouTube for hours doing not what
yeah so obviously their music algorithm
is great you can search a song and it'll
just go for the rest tonight it's
awesome
Oh someone said could play music
streaming service is not supported my
company that pisses me off a huge amount
about YouTube red oh my goodness I want
to watch I think it's called minefield
yeah it's on YouTube red I can't do the
thing yeah they want you to that's the
teaser they give you one episode to
watch and then you got a YouTube reddit
I think I might like subscribe to
Emperor Lee while we're in Vegas and
just try to like binge them you know I
have time yeah yeah if you have time to
watch that then that gives me a nobody
no I don't let's go back every time that
I go to see yes I'm like oh I'm gonna do
all these things I'm gonna bring my
personal camera I'm gonna take cool I'm
gonna do all this kind of cool of extra
stuff on the side and then it's like
nope you work from like 8 to like 3 and
then you sleep for a few hours and then
you get back up and keep going
I'm really hoping just to eat meals
that's all what I want to go to Vegas
and actually be able to hit at least one
buffet you know probably average one or
two a day yeah okay meals yeah yeah I
want to just have to eat that spar Oh
Pizza that's in the convention center
yeah there is okay there's some hidden
spots in the Convention Center on four
to your ways yeah don't tell everyone
hidden that's a good cause so back to
the chronology out of play came out in
2011 I think that I had never heard of
called YouTube music key came along in
2014 which gave subscribers ad free
music videos which is awesome because
obviously a ton of awesome music and
remixes and everything there on YouTube
but you hit play you try to put that on
a party and then ads interrupt it and
you look like a dork but then YouTube
music he kind of just turned into
YouTube red in 2016
yeah which expands to letting you watch
any video without advertising and now
it's just kind of like its own thing so
they keep just changing stuff in super
weird ways this service this alleged
rumored service is internally referred
to as remix okay it's gonna have
on-demand elements like a regular like a
Spotify but it's also gonna have some
YouTube elements maybe like some video
clips maybe some lyrics on screen that'd
be nice
so you can already do YouTube music
videos through google play music but
alright alright I I don't know I think
part of this might come from the supply
side apparently some of the creators
whose music is getting listened to
through YouTube they don't feel like
they're getting compensated as as fairly
as they would be on dedicated music
streaming services like Google Play
Music or on Spotify so it might be like
a money thing okay they put it on there
[Laughter]
I don't know I don't know yeah that's
for deploying this thing warner music
group is already on board they're one of
the big three yeah the music
and the other two of the three already
in talks with YouTube that includes the
Sony Music Entertainment and Universal
Music Group they're also talking to
Merlin a consortium source of
independent labels so hopefully they'll
have a good spread on content yeah I
like I don't know it'll probably be good
I it seems weird because it seems like
alphabet is now creating things to
compete against themselves yeah this is
like a hangouts a load yeah yeah that's
a good call so maybe something weird for
them it's because there's they're so
federated that they don't talk and they
step on each other all the time yeah
anyways going back to the Google Play
Music thing one of my favorite things
about it is just how creepy it is you
know it'll pull in a lot of data which
is unsurprising because it's Google
so it'll like you know when you're at
the gym yeah yeah you can see that you
can turn on notifications location
notifications like I see you're in the
border lineup I'm gonna play gangster
rap to me yeah I don't know it's it's
it's interesting every once in a while
I'll just jump into the different
playlists that it recommends for me to
try to see where it's trying to take me
and sometimes you know it'll go off in
totally a weird direction I'm like I
don't like any of this stuff but often
it's pretty good I've been happy with it
because when I had two problems with
Spotify the first was the discover
playlist was just totally like and stuff
I didn't listen to it all and the the
second was now maybe you can do this on
certain services with Spotify but I
usually use this with my TV and my
Google home and what I want to do is I
have a song on this on in my head and
I'm like I want to play this song and
then that's all I want to do and after
that I wanted to just go forever playing
related music and Google Play Music is
wicked app that's very good at that not
only will it play other songs that
you'll like they might not even be from
bands you know of yeah I start with a
Nine Inch Nails song the other day Nine
Inch Nails die hard the next ten songs
were for bands I never heard of it I
didn't skip a single one they're so
sweet nice actually really like doing
that sometimes yeah that's wicked if you
try to do this on Spotify guess what the
second song will be
the second song would be the same song
again because instead of playing the
song you search for and then a bunch of
related songs it will play all the
search results so it'll be like so you
try to put on so be like that same song
or like remixed by someone else try to
yeah you try to put on stairway to
heaven you get server to heaven then you
get live then you get cut that's like
yes yes Spotify this is what I wanted
no one's ever wanted this I'm gonna
hopefully troll at least one person ok
Google Play that hipster song with the
whistling ok so that's in one of their
you jerk did it work no no dang oh I
should have said with Google Play Music
so sometimes it gets confused if you
don't include that I don't know why but
because you guys in a different default
music player yeah yeah so if you have to
installed it might have to like ask or
whatever but you got me it did it yes
some people got ok now let it keep going
you can even mute it and leave it off on
the side or whatever but let it keep
going it does a pretty good job and it
doesn't continue to play whist or
whistle songs or what do you mean that
good job but it continues to play
hipstery kind of songs but that actually
sound kind of similar and fun with the
same tonality and all the other things
it does it does a pretty good job I
ended up already cancelled some people
like no that's good
someone actually said it didn't
recognize the voice yeah yeah I've got
that recently someone tried to troll me
and then Google was like that doesn't
sound like James yeah don't friend even
trying to impersonate my voice couldn't
get into my phone using that's not
surprising
yeah yeah I know but it's just it's it's
interesting it did a pretty good job I
would love to hear three devices are
some guy said three devices are playing
that song of my house right now when I
did the there's a previous rancher where
I did a similar command with some weird
Russian song that goes boom yes yes yeah
people kept tweeting me like man it was
it was 1:00 a.m. my whole family is
awake now yeah it's pretty bad we're
gonna we put a lockdown on that recently
okay so we're yeah maybe maybe that was
bad do that on purpose I did
it's the accidental ones
outpour hey there's actually an Amazon
echo topic here we can go right into
sure so this has to do with Amazon
trying to monetize and and place ad
units into echo devices so there's a
thread on the forum by man keys who
actually pretty much supplied a lot of
almost all of the threads today Thank
You Man key thank you very much however
I kind of think that your bank your
title for this is fake news because ooh
as far as I read it's not the case that
your Amazon echo is going to be reading
out ads to you that would just be so
brutal this as far as I've seen I don't
think that's what they're trying to do
but what they are trying to do is have
brands be like the sponsored search
results so just like when you google
something if you google new truck
there's gonna be a for data at the top
of your search results page right but
now we're talking about voice so there's
no page just so there's gonna be a
suggested product so if you ask like
there's an example here that says if you
ask a LAX a because we're not trying to
trigger the local commands anymore good
idea yeah to add an item to your
shopping cart it will suggest you buy a
particular brand so I think that means
like a LAX a can you add some
toothpastes it's my shopping cart and it
would be like okay I can look for a
brand like Colgate would you like that
and if you're like no it can find some
other stuff but the default matters does
a lot of people are gonna be like yeah
instead of being like no actually I
would like Sensodyne complete yes
[Laughter]
so yeah it's that is really intriguing
problematic yeah so apparently it might
suggest it based on your previous
purchasing decisions which is not that
bad so that would be a situation like
hey al exa I would like some surface
cleaner and they know that you bought a
Clorox Clorox product in the past so
they'll say okay do you want
Clorox pine-sol that kind of makes sense
it's gonna keep people in a little
bubble which is maybe not great mm-hmm
but if you're just trying to order
something with a voice command you're
probably not trying to shop around
you're probably just trying to stay
within your bubble you probably just
want the transaction done faster so
that's maybe not a bad thing I'd be
interested in hearing what other people
have opinions in terms of that if I'm
making a purchasing decision that I'm
even remotely unsure of I always yes
search this is probably for your second
time exactly Yeah right so and and it
says that it's going to suggest things
based on what people have previously buy
so if you've already bought one of these
and you're like hey I need some
toothpaste and you've been buying the
same toothpaste for freaking ever and
it's like hey do you want the same
toothpaste that you've been buying for
freaking ever you'll just say yes and
well that's what we want but now we're
talking about that not happen because of
sponsored posts yeah do you want the
thing you've always been getting or do
you want this new featured product that
like maybe sucks but they paid money so
that's what there's gonna be the default
yeah interesting it would be cool if
they had a voice command for like no I'd
like the usual the huge you know what I
mean yeah if you're you know at a
restaurant they might know what you want
like the dude at mucho burrito knows my
people at Subway over here they know me
too
yeah I took them like six months I have
a very simple order I get everything for
the veggies like everything yeah it's
like they have two decisions anyway
they're on it now question I think this
is interesting and I don't know I think
there's a if you're a glass-half-full
person or a glass half-empty person you
might have two answers here okay is it
likely that Google will also seek to
monetize and similar ways I will have
their the main advertiser in this space
right but is it antithetical to Google's
mission statement or corporate culture
be given that they're coming from a
place where they're taking the world's
information and putting down onto one
search result page they're giving you
options
it's democratic it's supposed to be
based on like the link juice of the
internet you know the democracy the
population popularity contest of the
Internet
when you get into voice you only get one
answer so does Google do the same thing
amazon's doing or do they never do that
I suspect they will Green yeah paid
advertising is Google's whole thing I
would say what I this this is just
making me think like we need more
competition for Amazon because like with
Google situation what is it going to
suggest you buy can you even Auto buy
things through voice with Guk Walmart
they have a partnership with Walmart
yeah well I just like it's it's the same
situation with Amazon where it's just
some like giant massive company eating
everything up this is gonna take more
purchasing from other random companies I
don't know Alibaba is coming soon yeah
of here yeah the usability about Alibaba
is not there compared to Amazon you know
has its own shop Express yeah come on
it's not there I mean like on the same
scale in terms of usability trust like
if something is a prime product on
Amazon if it's shipped by Amazon it's a
prime product it's uh it's highly likely
news that you're gonna get it on time
that you're gonna be able to have an
easy time with returns and warranty and
all that other kind of stuff I don't
know it's it it shelters you like most
normal stores do and a lot of online
situations don't do that properly and
they're shipping stocks and stuff like I
understand why Amazon's where they're at
but they need better competition one
more well we got a Duflo place let's do
floatplane and one more I'm gonna I
don't even know if I can maybe you can
find me in the club we don't call it
that anymore it's still not I don't know
if we're gonna be able to show
well either way screen sharing is not
happy right now but full plane has a
bunch of really cool stuff on it
at the moment there's even one thing
that doesn't happen that much there's a
poll ladies there's a discussion poll
asking you guys how you guys want us to
share CES content on Flo plain because
there's a few different good question
usually we don't care what you think
they'll not working so we will not be
able to screen share oh I bet you I know
why it's not working and I could fix it
if I had more time but I don't that's
okay there's yeah there's a poll asking
how you guys want us to share content
and essentially the decision was was
something like YouTube we have to
timeout our releases or YouTube's
algorithm is gonna be like no screw you
guys and they're already they're already
gonna do that a little bit because of
just the nature of how rapid-fire we
have to do CES content but we're gonna
do our best to spread it out and make
the YouTube robot happy but with Flo
plain whatever it doesn't matter we
don't have to fight any weird algorithm
so you guys have so far decided posted
in the main section and just fire ladder
at fire hell let her go so right when
it's ready we're just gonna post it up
you guys gonna get the content a little
bit faster it's not gonna be the
one-week window that it normally is
because that would be terrible but it is
gonna be a little bit faster in general
we're gonna give it up to you guys right
away it's gonna be good
you can look like a Twitter magician
yeah you're gonna be in the know it's
gonna be awesome on here regardless
outside of the pool
there is a tech wiki for why is windows
display scaling so bad I'm excited for
that I know a fair amount about it
because I did the surface studio review
and there's a lot of really interesting
information in that as to why the screen
is the resolution and aspect ratio and
stuff that it is it seems to me like a
topic that's like yeah it sucks but it
has to be this way
yeah like you just haven't thought about
it as hard as the engineers it sucks we
reason there's the 1 + 5 t review now in
white if you haven't seen the
for that it's been everywhere so I'd be
surprised there's a flow plane exclusive
behind the scene from right before
Christmas that just got released so I
don't know I think release now but I
will not spoil so the behind the scenes
thing I know some people are salty that
we don't release this in other places
but YouTube would destroy our search
ability if we did that because most
people don't care about these things I
think they're awesome and the people
that do care about them are pretty
hardcore about it but anyways there's
the 13 GPUs in one PC mining adventure
part 2 this is a very large departure
from the kind of amateur hour mining
adventure part one just you know you
know there was some comments they were
accurate
we're just know what by but we're moving
forward part 2 strong return part 3 is
gonna be even stronger of a return so
we're coming at you with some really
interesting mining adventure videos
they're coming PCI Express 4.0 as fast
as possible John back at it again with
the epic videos and LTT hand-made
there's an LTV video of a handmade
portable arcade box not that thing is so
et handmade one that's made by Kerry 42
as far as I know check it out
super cool and there's also some like
extra footage from the chiller
resurrection which is super cool so if
you were into that there's extra footage
the untold story of the Chile
resurrection again stuff that if we
threw this on YouTube people wouldn't
care as much it would hurt the channel
so we're just throwing it on flow plane
for the super-hard course and that's it
we're done
moving on to now this weekend there's
gonna be another keyboard video Oh Janey
keyboard video us I think we almost did
every one of them is ending here okay we
have another one yeah I think so this is
a little simple guy yeah sure let's just
do that I'm surprisingly if you think
about it 2017 was the biggest year ever
for electric car sales wow I'm super
surprised actually tell me more there
was a time in like in the
thirty yes like before the Model T we're
electric cars actually where the main
had the most market share above
combustion engines but since then this
is the biggest year ever someone asked
about the dust video I'm gonna just say
this right now the dust video is gonna
happen I'm gonna be in it Linus is gonna
be in it there's possibly other people
that'll be in it it's possibly not I'm
not stand where you're going with that
but no it's the dust computers they're
up in the corner I'm not gonna be in it
guys you should just you should just
walk through the screen at some point
hey
yeah the glass it's gonna happen we
haven't filmed it yet means it's not
gonna be filmed too at least after CES
so it's gonna be at least another week
until it's filmed but it's gonna happen
eventually anyways let me Chuck some
numbers at you here yeah December marks
the 27th twenty seventh month of
consecutive sales gains for plug-in
vehicles meaning v's so in 2017 there
was nearly 200,000 V's sold in the u.s.
one hundred ninety nine thousand eight
hundred twenty six this compares to 100
thousand 158642 what is that like a 30%
increase pretty decent so if you break
that down by the top five Browns that
were sold the top Tesla Model S was the
number one seller at 27 thousand sixty
next in line Chevy Volt Chevy bolt the
electric version at twenty-three
thousand two hundred ninety seven next
and I'm back to Tesla it was the Model X
21 over 21,000 low sold and then what
was that you're like whoa Lex no no
Frank the fourth one was the Prius Prius
prime from Toyota over twenty thousand
almost 21,000 sold and everyone wants to
know how many Tesla Model 3 s got
delivered in 2017 and it looks like it
was about two thousand about two grand
they're doing what a thousand a week now
which is less than a previous promise
that they'd be doing five thousand week
by the end of year they're now hoping to
hit five thousand a week by this summer
in terms of production
estimations that's pretty standard from
what we've been able to expect so far is
there's the estimation they won't hit it
but we'll do pretty darn good and that's
cool because they'll figure it out
eventually there you go
someone said in chat stream Labs is
releasing their own kind of version of
OBS cuz OBS is open source that is a
thing I'm gonna be screwing with out on
my personal stream I believe Colton is
as well but I don't know if I'll end up
using it we'll see that's another
interesting news bit though because if
your industry mning it streamlines a lot
of haha get it streamlines a lot of
different stuff which is cool and I
think we will see you guys at CES yes
we have so far never missed a wine show
at CES so theoretically there will be a
LAN show at CES but every single year
it's super random how it works is super
random who's on it is super random where
we are is super random what time it
starts not that that's different from
normal but it's pretty random be pretty
cool if we get it from a plane like here
we have Wi-Fi on the plane B that'd be
dope you might even be able to get by
with like a super Crapo resolution if we
get like everyone else on the plane to
not use Wi-Fi you may be able to get by
with a super terrible resolution if you
think sitting beside a baby on a plane
sighs wait till you're beside two
podcasters I think it would just get
rejected from twitch though because the
latency hmm because like I connected to
a game while I was on a plane just to
check out my latency and it was like
quite a few seconds between input and
what actually happened we can always do
another pre-recorded one like this one
was oh why
no joking and joking look it says Friday
January 5th right there Oh
JK oh the joke I gotta go man anyway
I'll see I'll see you guys see us video
see us when show next week see you later
good bye huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
