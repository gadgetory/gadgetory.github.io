the Kingston HyperX brand put your hand
down you should be ashamed of yourself
everyone should know that Kingston
HyperX brand so Kingston HyperX memory
for notebooks if you haven't heard of
that I'll forgive you because this is
kind of a more more different new thing
these are the Kingston HyperX
plug-and-play memory modules for
notebooks and what is special about
these little guys right here these are
eight gig kits so these are do two by
four gig kits right here they have heat
spreaders which is kind of neat you
don't usually see heat spreaders on
notebook memory you can see they're very
thin these are just little thin guys
because notebooks usually don't have
room for a lot of extra extra stuff on
the components you're packing them in
pretty tight but what's special about
the PNP branded memory here is that it
actually runs at high-end gaming type
specifications without any additional
intervention from the user as long as
the standard is supported by your
particular notebook so I have a couple
of different specs here I have one that
is a 1600 C 9 kit so that's cast latency
9 and then I also have an 1866 C 11 kit
as well and what's special about these
particular little kits is actually that
I'm going to give them to NCIX Esther in
order to do a giveaway for them on her
Facebook page in the near future
so in summary these are Kingston HyperX
PNP they run at higher end gaming specs
without making any changes in your bios
whatsoever as long as they are supported
properly by your notebook you've got
legendary kingston quality which
includes a lifetime warranty you can
take that for granted on a kingston
memory product and last but not least we
will be giving them away
yay dual eight gig kits so one to one
person one to another don't forget to
