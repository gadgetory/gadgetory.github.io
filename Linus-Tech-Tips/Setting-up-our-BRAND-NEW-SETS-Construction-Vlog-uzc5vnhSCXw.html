crappiness paint crew and we've got our
new sets to floor and paint today
welcome to painting and flooring gloss
oh wow that's dusty
Tunnel bear makes really really simple
privacy apps so people can enjoy a more
open Internet to try total bear for free
go to tunnel bear comm /l TT so we're
gonna have an accent wall that's gonna
be this kind of Navy warm blue and then
we're gonna have a lot of Gray's so this
is gonna be light gray darker gray
listen gonna be dark rain here dark gray
light gray it should look really good
hopefully so you just need to go to okay
and then the brush is for cutting in
corners where we're changing color so
you'll have to brush that corner right
there otherwise if you want to freehand
it then go for I'm sure if really I just
don't I just can't cross that line yeah
are you dead huh I came right on my face
I don't really know how to paint we just
paint your house why are we painting the
wall the same color as the wall I Love
Lucy notice oh I see do you know what
you need you need a tray all right wait
sorry what is this that's a roller pool
yes got it okay god I thought it was
like a wizard staff at first
what about like like do I got paint up
there like I got paint that mean I
should just take initiative I should
just paint it anyways kidding she's
gonna give me crap if I do if I make a
mistake you're going to match the people
I medium that's a medium ladder
that's your ladder tip number one to
painting take your glasses off doesn't
matter if you can't see but you're not
gonna get paint on your glasses and
water
process we we I'm water based doesn't
even or doesn't get yeah I thought you
were just gonna brush under there I know
it was and then I don't know actually
carried away yeah be cool okay that'd be
really cool okay step number one yeah is
reduce your reload time okay before you
actually that's a stupid spot for it cuz
you're right-handed right okay that way
you go like this you go back to the wall
okay you had it here so you're going
like this you know what oh my god back
over here go down this way always this
way because if you go backwards you're
gonna get paint all over your pants and
your shoes oh just fine because I don't
give a shit about your pants and shoes
but so you always go up and down up and
down the wall and you see how I'm
actually applying very little pressure K
should stop doing that I'm actually
trying to teach you something it's gotta
be the best way the most muscles I'm
doing painting now this is how light
pain see it's better when it dries right
so everything Linus said was pretty much
wrong this is the preferred way I don't
Carolina says use your legs that's
common sense right that's what I was
doing Gordon says yeah I was like this
it was like straight up talk to the hand
cause the face oh dang you can't hear
anything I'm saying this is actually
pretty dope this is a Russian in his
natural habitat shoes why are you
wearing slippers that's what you just
say yeah you said swear word I heard
that before I turn the camera yeah I
mean usually make fun of each other on
this channel but uh you did a good job
they said it's wide enough although
really I need to look through a camera
yeah a lot easier than painting no
friends why don't we just use our
printer and print out pictures of
flooring and then just line the floor
with that well we got fish the floor
I gotta finish the accent
so we're doing shiplap
and then we're doing a brick wall over
here
and I don't have to do vinyl siding on
the exterior first the final Society

outside of the house Colton's okay well

them I'm gonna start a cooking channel
what's the kitchen stuff what give us
enough yeah I'm actually painting the
bathroom I'm gonna be staying well we've
got here guys is a wash so one of those
gratifying things about painting is when
you put all of the wall outlet covers
back on nice that's nice you guys put a
floor in this it's really nice yeah so
what we're doing here is we're painting
