saga
we bought a Dell Optiplex for 27 bucks
on eBay stuck in a $30 graphics card and
got playable frame rates in a variety of
popular casual and eSports games that is
depending on your standard for playable
but we didn't stop there
for our second installment we're
actually taking a combination of our own
advice yeah brand some from our
community to bring that standard that
playable standard up by upgrading our
original system with a few more budget
parts and hopefully turning it into an
actually decent gaming PC so can we
build it yes we can maybe the new be
quiet silent bass 801 offers great
usability and utilizes noise dampening
events to keep your PC quiet
check it out on new egg at the link
below
so here's the deal using current-gen
parts the cheapest gaming PC that you
could build today and that would
actually be worth building is probably
around 350 to 400 bucks so in order to
make our Frankenstein ish collection of
parts worth the time investment and the
inherent risks that come with buying
used hardware we figure we've got to
undercut that price by a pretty good
margin while getting legitimately decent
frame rates so our goal here is smooth
1080p gaming at medium or so settings so
as a refresher here's our original
system there are some things we can
upgrade in here like the cardboard but
there are some other things that are
gonna be stuck with like the mother bore
the cooler the case and the power supply
once we start replacing those core
components that usually means we're
better off building something new but
that also means that we're gonna have to
be stuck with the 255 watt power limit
so the most obvious component to upgrade
here given that our GTX 650 poor thing
broken fan had a stuck at 720p and low
settings for the most part is the
graphics card but there's been a lot of
generations of graphics cards since the
600 series so which one should we go
with newer ones are obviously gonna get
us better performance but they stand to
potentially be bottlenecks and they
obviously come with a higher price tag
so to find the best bang for the buck
we hooked up our gtx 750ti a dt x 950
and a gtx 1050 Ti and ran some tests
there's some good news here for those of
you who are allergic to jank by the way
I mean we're not know clearly but some
people are and that is that many of
these newer GPUs actually are so much
more power efficient that we can get rid
of that SATA to 6-pin PCI Express power
adapter because they can draw all the
power they need from the slot so no more
of this weird cable
since yes like this one yeah oh great Oh
oh shoot
actually I'm sorry well we're still
gonna need that PCI Express riser yeah
yeah charge you right click and then
you're gonna get yeah you can't hold it
forever
yeah use life stuff oh you're dead yeah
if you press either you would have lived
okay so that's overwatch looks pretty
good
Wow look at the CPU usage though 90%
yeah yeah get him so yeah it was rocket
League we're getting around the same
frame rate even though we've upgraded
the GPU so it's actually still very
impressive you know we're getting very
playable framerates you're eating right
nice and smooth 1080 even as you went
through a whole particle cloud it was
I've been 90 right there but we're not
getting that much of an improvement
you know once again CPU activity pinned
above 90% yep all the way oh well this
is uh pretty much all we need to know
but why don't we open up one more game
just for a good measure here okay so
once again we are now running at 1080p
what kind of details are we looking at
here all right slow everything low
everything and really no improvement to
speak of yeah still around like 40
something yeah this is this is
noticeably choppy yeah we were at like I
think we got a well bad guy yeah I can't
tell the difference in csgo when they
don't have big red markers above their
heads like an overwatch they do they
have that in overwatch so that's why I
like it so in summary going with a 750ti
believing everything else the same gets
overwatch more playable and then similar
results in csgo in rocket League but
this time at 1080p
instead of 720p so it's an improvement
but the issue here is that our frame
rates are still not yeah great
they're about the same they dipped below
comfortably playable exactly so time to
upgrade all right let's do it
did I leave you hang in there no I owe
that time I did this guy's cheating you
definitely happen using net hacks what
is the net heck I don't even know that
hacks are the strongest tax their hacks
that interfere with the network
connection oh nice did you see that kill
even with a CPU even even with the
system being CPU bound I'm trashing the
competition okay you're only firing at
the lot like the big guy yeah because
that's all you can hit he's a big target
35 SES oh just got my ultimate oh okay
you're just gonna play goalie well I
mean I shouldn't surprise me that much I
knew Lera cpu-bound but I thought maybe
yeah and like nothing's happening on
screen I'm just like walking around it's
still it like well ok now it's at 50 but
its second ago is that like for you and
your dip down under 40 32 there so in
summary then even with our first GPU
upgrade we saw limited to no improvement
and then because of a fairly obvious
significant CPU bottleneck here
well we continued to have the same
experience as we made our way up the GPU
stack so the next upgrade is obviously
going to be our CPU not only is our
original one here from 2007 it's also a
dual core which wasn't a problem for
gaming then but it definitely is now so
according to Intel's compatibility list
the most powerful CPU for this chipset
the Intel g-41 Express is the core 2
quad QX 9650 it actually runs at a
similar clock speed but it's got twice
as many cores and we happen to have one
it's a good thing we did all the testing
before I started oh great I got a
screwdriver - let's do it together I'll
lead by example I'm sure there was a
time once well it's nice how easy these
upgrades hard to get out here it's just
like a hinge yeah great
great what's not so great is the fact
that there is more to CPU compatibility
than Intel's guidelines I'm afraid it
turns out Dell never validated the QX
9650 on this motherboard which I guess
kind of makes sense since who would put
an Extreme Edition in a business tower
that doesn't make maybe a crazy person
would try that race so we needed to find
one of the processors on Dells
compatibility list and our old friends
at free geek a non-profit electronics
recycling outfit located here in
Vancouver came to the rescue
they hooked us up with an Intel Core 2
quad 9550 it's a couple steps down from
the QX 9650 and it has a slightly lower
clock speed than even our East 7500 but
it's still a quad core so we're hoping
for a big improvement csgo whoa go
oh dang sputtering that is way smoother
look at that and like this is what the
750 Ti is the 750 Ti and $30 more for a
CPU quad-core CPU Wow I mean I still
can't kill anything but yeah you know so
you're hovering around 90 a hundred plus
right now yeah
going going up from 45 and far more
importantly if you're playing something
competitive is when there's a bunch of
action on the screen we're not getting
those same kinds of frame drops or dips
or hitches like it's it's smooth when
you pan around the corner there's no
stutter you know it honestly blowing me
away this is very playable yeah boom
boom boom boom whoa he went flying
well I fired larger than what Steve
oh you fire large bullets when I play
csgo
I like to fire a slightly larger bullet
than everyone else I closed it like an
idiot but we were sitting at only around
60% CPU usage ROI so there you go just
not running into a bottleneck just
having a couple of extra cores available
to it huh
ended up increasing our FPS what like
70% I'm bad at math that's crazy but it
went up a lot all right let's see you
pulling some noobs down 204 yeah you're
in the middle you smart guy let's go
let's go this guy is really bad but you
haven't killed him yet no but this is on
his hard sleep did you get eliminated
eliminated that's what I do to bad guys
that's killed each other though
interestingly though that's our CPU
utilization in overwatch so we were
still running into a CPU bottleneck
which means that even though we only
upgraded our GPU one more tier we
probably wouldn't get any further
improvements out of them even better one
because we had such a great experience
with csgo and overwatch we decided it's
the cheapest gaming PC we might as well
add the cheapest free game most popular
free game how do you just like get rid
of your stupid yeah this is this is
what's so annoying you can't get rid of
it you have to land oh you got oh damn
I'm gonna take his stuff you mind you
mind him to death I like this game yeah
it's somewhat playable what are we
running down here so this is a 1080p iam
medium okay alright
upgrading the CPU and the GPU got us
excellent results in terms of price to
performance so far our Optiplex here was
30 bucks the quad-core CPU was another
30 bucks and a 750 Ti is about 60 bucks
making this a 1080p 60fps gaming PC for
a hundred and twenty bucks and the crazy
thing is we're still not done yet now we
won't be improving gaming performance
this time around but going from a hard
drive to an SSD is certainly a quality
of life improvement which is why we
actually did it before we started
running all of our benchmarks and like
filming this video because otherwise
we'd waste a lot of time waiting around
for that hard drive so so pretty much
anything will do you but we chucked in a
Corsair force le and with Windows 10
installed it makes this old junker of a
machine almost feel like a new PC almost
so given that you can get a 120 gig SSD
for about 30 bucks on Amazon 150 dollar
gaming PC boom got it not bad I mean
like look at the responsiveness here
like whether you're just kind of
switching tabs like you guys saw me
opening up Photoshop they're like let's
launch a web browser like it doesn't
feel like a decade old computer at all
the only thing that's left is to deal
with this measly four gigs of ram but
upgrading ram on older systems like this
one can be a little bit challenging and
it can even
pretty confusing to even get started now
according to the spec sheet for the Dell
Optiplex 380 our system only supports 4
gigs of RAM to 2 gigabyte DIMMs but
since we have some ddr3 lying around we
figured we just might as well throw in
another 4 gig stick and see what happens
come on Riley don't screw it up again oh
I love the sound of that I'm not
checking your work I'm just yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah sure sure sure wait
are we expecting this to work or not I'm
not sure I've never done this before so
oh wow it worked whoo what was it
supposed to not sure really doing this
for the first time so don't know about
Ram
I thought you prepared this video yeah
it's ok look at ya eight gigs of DDR 3
days oh it worked
oh thank goodness ok I really can't tell
what did you think this was gonna work
or not I'm not sure so there can be any
number of restrictions on the kind of
memory that you can run in these sorts
of pre-built systems what speed the
sticks run at whether they're single
sided or double sided dims and even just
straight-up Hardware locks so that
they'll only work with certain brands or
certain models and given that our ram
upgrade actually didn't have that much
of an effect on gaming performance our
take here is that if you have some 4 gig
ddr3 dimms lying around give it a shot
but otherwise it might not be worth it
especially since once you've crossed
that 200 dollar threshold or once you
need to do more than just gain like if
you have to get actual work done it
might be time to start thinking about
spending a bit more to get something
more modern
with that said a
bit of frustration on the RAM upgrade
doesn't change that overall this was an
incredibly successful experiment I mean
we're not saying that we'd recommend
that everyone you know tries this at
home you know buying new PCs is dead
yeah that would be the click of the
clickbait thumbnail what don't you
clearly but it does show that contrary
to popular belief PC gaming isn't that
expensive to get into provided that
you're willing to do some bargain
hunting which I am you hunted this
that's why it's dead no looks dead my
computer it's like dismembered you know
I can't recommend enough the mass drops
sennheiser HD 6 XX headphones these are
based closely on one of Sennheiser's
all-time best pairs of headphones
they're actually the ones I use at home
and they're one of mass drops all-time
bestsellers with over 40,000 of their
members picking them up to date they
have not changed the driver and sound
structure compared to the HD 650 s
meaning you get a nice balanced
mid-range and natural sounding bass
they've got a detachable 6 foot cable
though instead of a 10 foot cable based
on community feedback and they've got
three and a half millimeter and quarter
inch jack compatibility for everyday use
it comes included with Sennheiser's
long-term support and you can check out

also down there's our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join is that gonna be our our thumbnail
yeah I think I'm thinking something are
you editing are you editing our
thumbnail on the machine wow yeah it's
like thumbnail ception
it's like it's it's good for work and
play that's very stylized I know yeah
