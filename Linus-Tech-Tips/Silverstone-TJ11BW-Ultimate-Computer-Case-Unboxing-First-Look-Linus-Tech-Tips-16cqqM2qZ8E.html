perfect chassis the tjo seven and i mad
okay it's not quite perfect my TVO seven
the tjo seven is the case I use for my
personal machine my tjo 7 has the
interior painted black it has some
modifications I've taken out the hard
drive cages I have used the back of the
motherboard tray for mounting SSDs I've
taken out the front bay covers and I've
replaced them with mesh I've doubled up
some of the back for cable routing
basically I've made some some teeny
changes but the chassis itself with it's
all aluminum unibody design is in my
opinion the finest case ever made
now when silverstone launched the TJ 11
i was very curious to have a look at it
because the TJ 11 is something of a
spiritual successor to the TJ o 7 with
some key improvements in technology that
have been made in the last 5 years
so the TJ 11 is actually larger than the
TJ o 7 the TJ o 7 has seven front bays
TJ 11 has nine so it's quite a bit
taller it's also wider and so what are
they using that extra height for well
for one thing the TJ o seven is great
for liquid cooling that's what I do with
mine I actually have a quad 120 mil
radiator in the bottom the TJ 11 allows
up to a quad 140 ml radiator so you got
more space in the bottom they've also
implemented the concept that was
introduced with the Raven series of
chassis with the RVL one which is the 90
degree altered motherboard mounting so
the cards actually have their i/o ports
at the top of the chassis rather than
the back of it and matthan that yeah
we've increased the size we put in the
90 degree mounting and I think that is
pretty much it for what I had to say
I'm going to let Silverstone's packaging
and documentation here do the rest of
the talking okay so like my my packing
came off while I was taking it out of
the box but give me a second to get this
unwrapped and I will show you guys the
TJ eleven so we've got the TJ eleven
extracted from the box you can clearly
see that with me standing next to it the
case appears very large pretty pretty
much anyone standing next to it the case
is going to appear pretty large so let's
just go through what silverstone has to
say for themselves on the outside of the
box which we haven't quite done yet so
not content with its past achievements
silverstone engineers name to set
another benchmark
okay so beautifully crafted all aluminum
TJ eleven is a pleasure to work with
it's free of rivets now this is part of
what allowed me to make the
modifications that i was able to make to
my TJ l7 it can be completely
deconstructed and reconstructed very
easily even if you need to take it apart
paint it and put it all completely back
together it's also easier to clean for
that reason as well I've taken it apart
a few times so they have kept with this
proud tradition with the TJ eleven you
can completely take it apart bigger
lower compartment to house even the
largest radiator available talked about
that as well potential and flexibility
are truly unrivaled uh okay a thousand
watt plus cooling capacity on air you
can build an impressive storage server
with its plethora of drive bay options
or even an amazing piece of technology
artwork with liquid cooling so this has
all been covered so far plenty of
ergonomic touches such as quick access
filters a hot swappable harddrive base
which is the TJ o7 did not have
removable motherboard tray which do
seven did have CPU black backplate
cutout which the O seven my oh seven
doesn't have but I believe the newer
ones do and an optimized cable routing
path to enable easy maintenance and
upgrades for efficiency awesome okay
let's move along here so I need agree
motherboard mounting I've already talked
about it includes two air penetrator air
AP one eighty one fans to aid stack
cooling so that is their cooling design
with the motherboard rotated 90 degrees
extra-large
venting area for the tenth expansion
slot which we'll have to show you
later rivet feet free construction room
for powerful water cooling equipment
dual power supply support that's another
thing that it carries over from its
predecessor the TJ o7 all aluminum
construction with and the dies sandblast
and finish now this I'm really glad to
see check this out so on the TJ o7 we
had the anodized sandblast finish which
is kind of our rough finish I don't want
to touch it because I don't want to
leave fingerprints and then on the sides
we had a brushed finish now brushed
finishes I love them they look beautiful
but they are a fingerprint disaster you
touch them and it actually etches into
the aluminum from your fingerprints and
you can't even rub it off if you let
that those oils sit there for long
enough whereas with the with these
sandblasted finishes they're actually
far more durable in terms of being well
they're harder to scratch they're more
difficult to damage with your fingers
etc etc so for the side panels mine
particularly have irremovable marks
indelible marks at the back from from
taking it off and putting it on so you
should be able to avoid that with this
case alright a silverstone exclusive
dual extruded aluminum unibody frame
with thickness of up to four point five
millimeters so the unibody frame here
they're talking about a single piece
that where are they saying yeah the
single piece that runs through the
entire front curve of the chassis so
that is something that's been carried
over from the TJ 7 9 5 minute
quarter-inch phase twin removable hard
drive cages with built in see po5
hot-swappable adapter cloth to show you
that a minute six three and a half inch
hard drive trays which you can look at
this picture over here so that they can
see for now six three and a half inch
hard drive bays built using industrial
grade nylon very cool okay and then
massive lower compartment we've talked
about that before power supply housing
area for up to two power supplies dual
see-through air intake vents with
removable filters okay i'll put an air
penetrator fans yeah yeah top mounted
slide-out motherboard tray system to
facilitate installation nine plus one
expansion slots enable support for excel
ATX motherboards and multi-gpu
configurations so that's a good one as
well the TJ 11 is actually
the few cases on the market that can
accept something like a gigabyte g1
assassin motherboard natively with no
modifications whatsoever alright let's
take the side panel off oh we can have a
look at the accessories that are
included as well so we've got three SSD
adapters so that's two and a half to
three and a half inch adapter I'll look
at this they let you decide if you want
to put on the silverstone badge or not
so it just comes with a double sided
tape on it so you can either put that on
your case or you can not is there
particular place it goes no you decide
excellent alright
dual power supply adapter just a relay
so that will turn on at the same time
fan filters two of them oh they're
magnetic nice all right TJ eleven manual
screws another Silverstone badge this
one's not made of metal it's more of a
sticker but it's smaller it's also nice
yeah this is a metal sticker but it's
very very nice
okay we've got a molex to three three
pin adaptor for your fans and then
finally we have the single redundant
power supply option here if you're
building like a high-end workstation and
you're going to put that in a
silverstone TJ 1100 there's that extra
screwed was wandering or that one okay
here is the side panels very thick look
at that piece of aluminum right there
incredibly thick heavy-duty construction
that's what makes this case even
remotely workable with though the fact
that it's made of aluminum if this was
made of steel it would weigh more than I
can carry I'll tell you guys that much
so you can see here this is completely
free access for the air air penetrator
fans here - fresh air flow from the
outside and then down here these grilles
are all opened up so that for people who
are going to remove the lower hard drive
cages and mount a large radiator down
there they will have all the access to
airflow that they need for the cooling
fans on the radiator itself so since
this is a sort of a like a backwards
case I'd actually opened up well it's
like backwards and then
to 90 degrees so I've actually opened up
what would normally be the correct side
to see the motherboard tray itself but
in this case it's not oh yeah it comes
with an anodized aluminum mousepad as
well which is just gorgeous so let's
open up the other side give me just a
minute here won't make you guys sit
through that so I opened it up but I
realized we're not really done with the
outside so up here on the top of the
case we've got an enormous grilled area
so this is actually the main exhaust for
the case the back of the chassis itself
actually has no room for exhaust at all
because that is not the function of the
back of this case so let's go ahead and
take this off it's just held in place by
clips all right now you can see what
would normally be the back of a computer
case so there's your i/o here's where
you can plug in the front USB if you're
not using the internal headers alright
and there are your nine plus one okay
what does that mean so 9 plus oh just
this is just translation space for that
tenth spot so there's your nine plus one
ah PCI slots as well for your XL ATX
motherboards lots of ventilation space
around the sides and the bottom as well
and a 120mm fan here at the back the
power button is also here on the top and
then on this side we've got 2 USB 3.0
ports as well as a reset switch and then
on the other side we have two USB 2.0
ports as well as our front audio ports
on the front I want you guys can have a
closer look you can see the five and a
quarter inch bays as well as oh another
power switch so they've actually built
in two power switches so whether you
want to turn it whether you want to have
it sitting on the floor next to you and
be able to reach the power switch here
or whether you want to have it up on
your desk and reach the power switch
here you will have easy access to turn
on the computer honey
alright moving around to the other side
this case does include a side panel
window so you can see the sexy hardware
that you have hopefully installed in it
because if you're going to buy this case
and put in like a you know micro ATX
motherboard like onboard video and yeah
we'll just have to stone Nia to death
okay so there you go that's what it
looks like with the window on and now
off and let's have a look at the
internal features so here we can install
all of our five and a quarter inch
devices here we can see the hot
swappable three and a half inch bays you
can also see that oh I don't even know
why it included SSD adapters because it
looks like we can probably just screw
SSDs natively onto these right there
like that
maybe there's ones that that don't have
that piece I'm not sure percent sure how
these work there we go nice excellent
okay let's have a look at these other
ones it looks like they're all the same
yeah those are all the same so that's
how the hard drives go in here are the
enormous ap 181 fans so these are going
to be blowing up at your components
which will be installed this way so your
video cards are going this way
lengthwise here see that alright here is
the motherboard tray which as I
mentioned before supports up to XL ATX
so that's where you have those longer
motherboards like the g1 Assassin okay
here's our front USB 3.0 hookups
let me just see where those cables come
from yeah it looks like if you wanted to
hook those up to internal adapters for
the time being you're going to need to
get an adapter from these to an internal
header but since on this case you're
hiding all of these cables anyway it's
not nearly as big of a deal
alright oh speaking of the back actually
there's a cutout right here which is
going to allow you to run things like
your your display cables up into the
case without being obstructed by this
piece right here okay
there's so much to this case I'm sorry
this video so long guys but there's
really nothing I can do about it so the
AP 180 ones have filters on them which
are removable and cleanable there you go
they have free access to all of the
outside air as I mentioned around on the
other side but that goes for both sides
all of the internal cables are black
black black so there's sleeved there's
your there's your dual power switch
right there see how as two cables going
into it there's your power LED hard
drive LED reset switch your front USB
and your front HD audio is all there
here are the SATA cables for those hot
swap bays so you can either leave those
in plug all these into your motherboard
and then leave them as hot swap or in my
case what I'd be doing is I'd be
removing them all finding somewhere else
to put my drives like like I did on my
TJ o7 is I bolted all my assist YZ on
the back of the motherboard tray so I
might do something like that or mount
them on the back of the five and a
quarter inch base whatever the case may
be and I think that pretty much covers
everything that I have to say about the
TJ 11 for now I'm actually going to be
doing a new Xtreme buyers guy featuring
the TJ 11 so I invite you guys to stay
tuned for that I'm going to be finally
updating my liquid cooling how-to with
some higher performance part parts I did
kind of a cooling essentials guide way
back when as episode number two of NCIX
tech tips so this time we're going to do
it right we're going to do it with the
g1 assassin in the TJ 11 with some cool
Swift tech water cooling parts and I'm
definitely very excited about that so
stay tuned and let's see what the TJ 11
has in store I've never built in it
before but on the surface it looks like
it addresses pretty much any complaint I
could have possibly had about my ideal
case the TJ o7 we've got the black
interior
we've got better cable management it's
roomier for more water cooling goodness
and other than that I mean what else
what else is there to change thanks for
