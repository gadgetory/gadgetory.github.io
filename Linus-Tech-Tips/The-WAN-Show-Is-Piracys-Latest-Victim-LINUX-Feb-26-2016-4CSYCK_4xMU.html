the wench and everyone else to welcome
to the Wynn show we are finally live
I was helping Luke I create you see what
the I was helping Luke create custom
length Ethernet cables by basically
looking at what he was doing going wow
gee that looks too hard and then going
and getting some ethernet cables I
happened to buy a few months ago that
happened to be the length of the cables
he was trying to make and handing them
to him so he should be wrapping that up
a pretty darn quickly and then he'll be
joining me here on the show we've got a
great show for you guys today
gonna be a lot of discussion around
Mobile World Congress obviously that was
the big thing that happened this week
lots of you know you know news about the
latest happenings in the desktop
computer world
I need like a cricket sound effect that
I can play so a lot lots of stuff from
the the biggest handset makers you know
your Samsung your LG your caterpillar
evidently that that's that's a thing so
we'll be talking a little bit more about
that actually the caterpillar phone
looks really interesting I'm hoping to
be able to get one for a review what
else we got going on DirectX 12 explicit
multi-gpu mode has been tested by PC
world so we're gonna check that out I
don't know I'm sure there was something
else that's interesting arrow cools
dream box chassis kit potentially a more
maker friendly chassis than we've ever
seen before and software piracy
apparently hurts Linux adoption a
research study fine so more on that at
11
it's so funny I got a guy in the chat
that's like sorry I'm late can you start
over but yeah I by god I wish that one
of the things that I could do alright so
here we go we're starting over
welcome to the wine show guys boom let's
roll the intro oh boy alright so I think
the first topic today is gonna be let's
see what can i what can I handle without
my my dynamic duo
Ultimo sidekick here I'm sure there's
something you know what why don't we
jump right into the Mobile World
Congress stuff if you have to go make
Ethernet cables somewhere I think that's
totally fine because basically I'm gonna
be listing specs for the next 20 minutes
which I actually won't and by the way
the battery on your laptop's low get
rekt
I love how Dell says strike the f1 key
to continue it's like you have to be
really sure they want you to not press
not push not even hit you got a strike
you got a hit with precision accuracy
intimidation I'm just stalling for time
at this point alright so let's jump into
the galaxy s7 and s7 edge unlike last
time it looks like we're going to be
seeing an s7 and s7 edge they aren't
just complete equivalence of each other
with one of them having a curved screen
so with the s6 and the s6 edge they were
they were actually kind of two versions
of both there was the there was the the
note which I sort of like a galaxy s6
larger and then there was the edge plus
so this time around the s7 and the s7
edge are just totally different so the
edge now is a larger phone so it's
actually got a 5-point I believe it's a
five point four inch display versus the
five point one inch display of no excuse
me
5.5 inch display compared to the five
point one inch display of the s7 edge
they're both running quad HD Super
AMOLED displays and they're going to be
very similar to their predecessors in
that regard
the camera is a big change on going from
the s6 series to the s7 series so
they're going down from a 16 megapixel
camera to
12 megapixel camera this time around
they are doing the whole HTC ultrapixel
thing except that there's a power bar
there don't know the other one so
there's so they're actually reducing the
pixel count in order to use larger
pixels for better light capture
especially in low-light conditions but
hopefully like Apple they're doing it
right so they're doing it in a way
that's not going to hurt the performance
of the camera in more normal shooting
scenarios something that many people
complain about what the one and seven
this is cool so we are getting back the
ip68 water and dust resistance so they
are saying that it's going to allow for
submersion in up to one and a half
meters of water for 30 minutes at a time
and we're getting some beefed up specs
of course so Snapdragon 820 Exynos
processors in some regions of the world
this is so bizarre to me the way Samsung
does this it's like this region this and
that region but then again and you know
it's funny as they get away with it like
you look at how much crap Apple took
just over using two different foundries
for the same damn chip design meanwhile
Samsung's like oh yeah we're just be
completely different processors don't
worry about it at least that is done by
region though with the very awful one it
was like a gamble yep what one do I get
complete poop nicks yeah so to speak um
some other big changes so we are getting
back microSD expansion Samsung either
heard their customers loud and clear or
this is nothing that they didn't know
already and they intentionally withheld
that from the last generation to hope
for there to be some reason some reason
for people to upgrade from the s6 to the
s7 there's also four gigs of RAM this
time around actually I don't know no no
I think they were three s6 I've done and
it's all blurring together because it's
like a new phone spec bump really
premium looking devices this time around
with like glass and metal and all that
kind of stuff so that's again a huge
step in the right direction love that
from Samsung cuz they do it really well
when they decide to do it
um no removable battery but the capacity
on the s7 looks pretty good it's got a
3000 milliamp hour battery and that
combined with Android 6.0 marshmallow if
any power saving features we gain there
should be enough for you to get great
battery life even if you use the
always-on display feature so Samsung is
claiming that you lose only about a half
a percent of battery per hour in its
tests by having the display on all the
time so that's just displaying love so
critical information I mean this is
something that I've seen before you've
probably seen before
things like smartwatches that use AMOLED
displays will have an always-on display
so that oh that's funny I'm holding the
tape there you go you can whatever you
can barely see it whatever here against
the purple background and I've seen sort
of ambient display modes on phones
before like the Droid turbo that had
that proximity sensor that you could
just kind of wave it it whenever you
want to see and honestly that works
really well but this seems pretty good
and it won't necessarily be on all the
time it does have a proximity sensor as
well it just uses it for the opposite
purpose so it'll actually turn off those
pixels that it's illuminating to tell
you the time or notifications or
whatever else and whenever it's in your
pocket or facedown on a table or
whatever else although if you're the
kind of person who puts your phone
facedown on a table feel bad feel bad
about that because there can be small
like micro fragments of actually
surprisingly hard minerals like I don't
know if people know this but like sand
is not necessarily all made of sandstone
okay there's all kinds of minerals and
elements and deposits and junk in just
regular ordinary sand to the point where
my iPhone 6s is scratched to crap just
from going in and out of my pocket from
getting a bits of dust and debris and
sand in my pocket because I didn't put a
phantom glass protector on it I know I
even have one I have two I have a normal
one and a privacy one and I was just
like you know Yolo Yolo I'm going
bareback on the 6s because I did so well
with the Droid turbo which doesn't have
a
some glass protector for it so I never
even had the option and I'd like had it
for over a year and I was like oh this
thing's still doing really good I'm like
getting good at this like taking care of
my phone thing with that said not all
glass are not all scratch resistant
glass is made equal even from Gorilla
Glass like I swear with exactly the same
treatment I have encountered phones that
scratch very easily they're using the
same kind of glass as ones that just
seem to be completely bulletproof like
that droid turbo and seem to be nearly
impossible to scratch I think there's uh
there's a bidding process that goes on
that corning seems to not talk about
where there are different grades of even
every type of Gorilla Glass and it might
be a little little touch of the ill luck
of the draw as to whether you get a good
one
or one that is not as good all right we
can briefly go over the s7 edge so
larger display like I said five and a
half inches the back of the device now
has a curve to it as well
making it more comfortable to hold has a
3600 milliamp hour battery and other
than that looks like pretty much the
same darn thing so I'm doing way fewer
phone reviews this day these days
there's a couple of reasons for it
number one is I just don't think they're
that different from each other anymore
yeah and number two is that I I was
getting it was really wearing on me
because not all reviewers do this but I
actually switch to the phone outright
that I am reviewing I take my sim out of
my normal phone and while these days
because I use Google Authenticator for
pretty much everything I do still need
to carry around my daily driver phone
because switching over all that stuff is
a real bear I only use the other phone
for everything else and it has just been
wearing on me to be switching phones all
the time like that so I only plan to
review one of the galaxy s7 and the s7
edge so I'm gonna do a straw poll here
guys I want you to let me know which one
you want to see here we go
strawpoll man they make it easy to do
pools Boop there you go
so I want to see what you guys want to
see I mean I want to know what you guys
wanted just okay whatever I'm gonna
click results now some more interesting
phones so the LG g5 seems to have kind
of jumped out in front of everyone else
on the whole modular phone concept
certainly not to the same degree as
someone really guys the edge it's a five
and a half inch device I can practically
write that review right now the phones
really nice it's really fast
Samsung continues to make improvements
to TouchWiz but it's too big for my
hands uh actually not personally a lot
more interested in the s7 than I am in
the edge apparently very few of you who
are interested in it at all though this
is one of the lowest percentage voter
turnouts I've ever seen we've got 4700
people watching and like a thousand of
you voted okay there we go it's a little
better 1,500 see looks like the s7 is
making up some ground here but Wow you
guys are with me on the whole phones
just not really being that interesting
anymore thing it looks like the g5 does
look legitimately interesting though so
not modular to the same degree as
something like the phone blocks concept
where the idea was you'd actually have
like almost like a breadboard with like
a screen in front of it and then you
just have like these modules that you
can modularly plug in or take out and
even cleaning to be able to do things
like a hot swap a battery module while
the phone is running that's not out yet
that's something that's in a lab
somewhere that probably will see the
light of day in the future but for now
the g5 does offer some modularity so the
original article here I was supposed to
buy ninja shadow on the forum the last
one was Chris Rowe 996 and our original
article here is from Android a for
attack
um so they've got basically most of the
phone is not modular so phonebloks was
like yeah you could like put in a new
processor in RAM and storage and blah
blah blah this one most of it is not
modular it is pretty much a phone they
still got the power button on the back
although thankfully for me I prefer this
they've moved the volume rocker to the
side of the phone then um it's got I
think it's a 2800 milliamp hour battery
it's got some dude holding it up here
design and build quality oh yeah they're
going for a much much more like premium
feeling designed to it it's got this
actually kind of reminds me of is it
Nexus S original Nexus and this actually
looks like this rounded business here it
feels like kind of a dated design
language but um yeah yeah yeah really
reminds me of that with the with like I
sort of the curved look to the bump um
but I mean it as long as it feels good
in the hand then I'm not gonna give them
I'm not gonna give them too much flak
over that but there's a few unique
features to this one that actually make
it really interesting to me so
Snapdragon 820 Adreno 530 four gigs of
ram don't worry none that was unique yes
it is 2,800 milliamp hours for the
battery I did just check on that no
support for wireless charging oh yeah
the last thing that's a total bummer and
a missed opportunity about the s7 and
the s7 edge Micro Micro B USB connector
Hey it's 2016 if it's not Type C I don't
want to see it anymore get it I don't
want to see anything else it's not a
joke it's just dumb um anyway so the g5
supports quick charge 3.0 but no
wireless charging it has a dual camera
setup this is where we're starting to
get into the cool stuff so it has a
normal that's funny my notes say normal
angle so it just has a more standard 16
megapixel camera then this is cool it
has a wide-angle 8 megapixel camera and
the phone can actually stitch in
from the two cameras into one image and
it also allows you to switch between the
135 degree wide angle and the regular
camera manually within the app with an
instant transition this is one of those
it is so difficult to get the best of
both worlds unless you just put two
cameras on it
problems and LG ran out and solved it by
putting two cameras on it because one of
the things that I liked so much about
the s6 was the relatively wide angle
lens particularly on the selfie camera
which made it so that you didn't have to
have that you know that selfie look like
that you got the one arm out and you're
like trying to make your face Square to
the shot and trying to look natural but
you can't get it out far enough to get a
decent picture well with a nice wide
angle lens you don't have to you can be
very comfortable you can be very square
and the phone can be very close to you
so having the ability to take to take
sorry to take wider shots of close-up
subjects or this is the problem with
that or to be able to get a reasonable
reasonable clarity on a shot of
something like you're you know you're at
a hockey game or a basketball game or
something and you know you're that
person because everyone does it well
it's like ooh this picture of this
player is special because I took it then
you're actually able to do that in a way
that you otherwise can't
all right aluminum unibody power button
built into the rear fingerprint sensor
fingerprint sensors are a great thing
especially when they're well implemented
I am such a huge fan of that I really
wish it was better on the z5 compact it
was it's a funny thing about this phone
it was um it was something that I that I
was not able to really tackle properly
in my review but that I can follow up
with now no matter how many times I
reset my fingerprint in the settings it
works great for a bit and then stops
working great and while you could say
well Linus it's obvious the answer is
that your morphling and your
fingerprints change over time I really
don't think that's it because the iPhone
6s that I reviewed before that and I'm
now using now after that review works
like instantly just fine any
so let's get into the modules so what
they're allowing you to do is swap ice
it looks like a single module so you
have to kind of pick okay what's my
specialty so they're allowing you to
remove the bottom cap of the phone and
swap in these modules so you lock this
allows access to a replaceable battery
or you could add something like a camera
grip which gives you manual control for
shutter and zoom as well as as well as
an increase in the battery capacity so
another 1,200 milliamp hours so that
side brings it up to four thousand
milliamp hours if you have that grip on
it they've also got one called the LG
hi-fi plus so that's an audio module
from Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen which features a 32
bit as if that means anything
DAC as well as a dedicated
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
port and there are apparently more
modules to come I can't think of too
many modules that I would particularly
want to add to a phone so I guess I'd
like to take this opportunity to hand
off to you guys and ask you what exactly
would you add to a phone so let's let's
let's do Twitter blitz here I want to
hear from you guys at line is tech on
Twitter what module would you like to
see from LG let's go ahead and put that
right there
PC build in a fridge does it work come
on let's bring on those tweets bring on
those tweets as many battery modules as
I can get who does an hour-long podcast
all by himself not this guy yeah and not
this guy yeah I love your timing
eventually yeah we've actually both done
that before we have both done that
before yeah all right come on guys come
on that thing that I'm working on is
pretty much as far as it can go until I
need to make large amounts of noise okay
cool yeah we could talk about that
actually here why don't we talk about a
couple of the videos we've got coming I
mean Yolo right let you do your I just
do it in the background sorry do it in
the back or do it in back down in the
background so we talked about that which
allow that yes
so basically essentially I live in a
rented place like a lot of people and
when you live in a rented place usually
you know they don't want you to drill
like giant holes in the wall because
that can suck sometimes you can get away
with it by just not telling them but
that's not really an option with my
landlord
so I'm instead of putting my networking
on a wall I'm putting it on a board
which I can just lean against the wall
because up until now all of my
networking kit my access point my router
my modem my giant switch all of it was
just in like a pile and all the cables
were just going everywhere and it was
disgusting and horrible and I hated it
back to the pile so so instead I'm
mounting it on a board that's what I'm
doing over there so when I was off
screen I was like brokering stuff down
and routing cables and doing stuff like
that it's not perfect but I'm doing it
really fast
so I bought a thousand dollar HDMI cable
today no I I had people on Twitter are
freaking out there look boilers to waste
money I'm like I know I know I know
trust me I know you guys you guys who
watch the wind show you guys are the
inner circle okay so I'm not gonna tweet
out
I know because if people have been
watching our people I've been watching
long enough to follow on Twitter and
they don't know that I'm aware of the
issues that's crazy
with a thousand dollar HDMI cable then
they can just wait for the piece of
content they don't get to be inner
circle okay so I know the point of the
video is that someone remember that I'm
not buying an HDMI cable to own an HDMI
cable I am buying an HDMI cable to make
a piece of content about a forementioned
HDMI cable and the issue with the high
end cable industry is that you've either
got the people who I can't figure out
why but they either buy into the snake
oil and because they get given the
cables
maybe I'm guessing or they buy into the
snake oil because they bought the cables
they can't return them and they can't
admit
that they got fleeced and I think that's
where a lot of this offending purchasing
decisions yeah I think that's where a
lot of this these myths get perpetuated
because the only people willing the only
people who have them to talk about them
fall into one of those two camps for the
most part so everyone else all the other
people who know better are too smart to
buy one so what i'm doing here
effectively is i am taking it for the
team yeah I just spent a thousand US
dollars Oh on and yeah it's so much
worse on an all silver we are talking
silver wires okay the premiumness
the premium one meter cable and then I
am legitimately going to benchmark it in
a way that should actually be meaningful
oh yeah see that's the part you didn't
know I bet no because yeah well I
haven't gonna do that - um that is
unless it actually turns out to perform
better because in my benchmark there is
a chance
in fact my benchmark will give it every
advantage because while watching a video
or listening to audio over a
forementioned hdmi cable literally
cannot at least on this earth be
affected by the silver wires I believe
that it is possible if the design of
their cable is truly superior that I
will be able to overclock a monitor
further with it because monitor
overclocking is dependent on the
cleanliness of the signal as well as the
Headroom that's left in the scaler of
the monitor so my intention is to take a
high refresh rate high resolution
freesync monitor so it's got a high
powered scaler in it and then using HDMI
1.4 I am going to overclock as high as I
can with the silver cable and overclock
as high as I can with a four dollar
cable from
monoprice if it performs better in a
repeatable consistent fashion then the
cable is superior but that won't change
anything about it won't make it worth
$1000 in any meaningful way because you
could just get a display port cable yeah
and you're not overclocking your home
theater because all the content you're
watching on that runs at 24 to maximum
60 frames per second that brought up a
point saying it overclocked your monitor
but you just spent $1000 on a cable so
why didn't you just buy the better
monitor that's not the point
because you can overclock better than
the best monitor yeah yeah yeah all
right
that to which my point is just is the
case is the cable better in any possible
way at all
yes and so we are going to we are going
to do our best to answer that question
that no one cared about because no one
was gonna buy that cable who watches our
videos definitively yeah um so yeah I
don't know should be it should be cool
I'm looking forward to it because that's
the kind of stuff that's this really fun
for me is is like taking the the general
wisdom and actually testing it which I
guarantee you I guarantee you almost
every single person who says expensive
hdmi cables are a waste has never used
one which doesn't mean that they're
wrong it doesn't mean they're wrong okay
I'm not gonna it just means they haven't
used one they're taking what someone
else said as the truth you're not wrong
with me I have not used one I have not
used one yep so I'm gonna use why don't
we for the first time
yeah the workshops although do you want
to try it - sure okay we're both try
we'll try it together we'll have like an
we'll audition the cable you know we'll
have like a listening party I
oh I think so I think that's pretty I
think that's pretty famous there the
danceable cables expensive cables you
should oh no heavens no all right so
let's let's jump into oh this is great
was I supposed to buy good bytes on the
forum
I swear I think he would actually curl
up into a ball and die if someone else
beat him to the punch on some like
positive Microsoft News and this is some
pretty positive Microsoft news the 8th
the HP elite x3 we've talked about the
leaks last week but obviously there are
more details is announced and it is
designed to be your Windows Phone laptop
and desktop to which my reply would be
sorry good bytes and everyone else who
thinks this is relevant this is not
relevant we're not there yet
it's running a Snapdragon 820 it is
running four gigs of RAM it's got hold
on I'm gonna have to do slow to switch
between scenes of RAM is not nearly
enough
well that's top experience ok it's not
really no for me no it's not nearly
enough for you but it's also a fun need
like 32 gigs of RAM for my tabs bro me
too sadly enough I run out of the 16
gigs of RAM on my computer upstairs
ected me I used to be great I'd have
like five times open at a time lots of
tabs is great and then I used to laugh
at you because you'd have way too many
tabs open and now I have like four
windows of the same browser and there
they all have too many you want to hear
the truth
what you got busier yeah it's true and
it's not about being too busy to close a
tab it's about that you're legitimately
working on every single thing that's
open in a tab and and and when you get
that dizzy you you start to you start to
think about your time very differently
the three seconds that it takes to type
in a URL is not worth the organisation
of not just having that tab open already
and when you're really busy and you work
on the same tasks repeatedly you
actually you learn you remember where it
is yeah tab number one is my is my work
Gmail tab number two is usually my
second work Gmail for when I need to
reply to something tab number three is
gonna be my personal Gmail well no not
my personal my YouTube my YouTube like
personal
Gmail tab number four is this happening
and you actually and so it's like this
chunk is usually like something I was
working on a while ago and then I need
to get back to this chunk is what I'm
working on right now it's not that hard
to find things it's faster than opening
up a new tab I have a whole window for
forum management which has like the
tiered system that you decide yeah I
have a whole window for like like emails
and like so like work email I have work
email inbox and then I work email like
working on whatever it is that so my
social land yeah yeah yeah social land
like whatever music is currently going
on all that kind of stuffs in that
window that like working on video a and
then working on video B yeah man yeah
tat tat boy those have stack tab life um
all right so back to the elite x3 which
kerbs crushes like four times a day well
that's because it's Firefox Chrome has
its own issues the my chrome at home is
just brain explosion like total brain
explosion my Chrome on my laptop has
another it has an issue too like
whenever I VNC into our servers I in
Chrome did it's the one computer it
doesn't work perfectly on I remember the
whole idea behind Chrome remember the
commercials really lightweight no I'm
gonna get back to that I have not
forgotten it's sitting there with the
new notifications waiting for me yeah
yeah it's not yeah um okay so let's talk
about the elite x3 though the most
powerful Windows 10 mobile device you
can get 40 150 milliamp hour battery
that I like oh five point nine six inch
AMOLED quad HD display quad-core
Qualcomm blah blah blah 64 gigs of
storage expandable to 2 terabytes with
micro sd although if you're storing two
terabytes of data on a micro SD card you
need to re-evaluate your strategy that's
a really terrible idea I don't I can't
think of anything that could be enough
to be 2 terabytes but that could be
unimportant enough to put a micro SD
card I could be wrong it's got a 16
megapixel rear camera 8 megapixel front
camera windows hello I
and fingerprint scanners that's pretty
darn cool ip67 rating for dust and
waterproof Milson military standard 810
rating one meter drop very nice she and
PFA wireless charging holy freakin crap
BitLocker encryption image encryption I
can yes and here's where we get into the
really interesting stuff because it has
continuum it allows you to either wired
Lee or whoa yeah USB 3.0 type C way to
go wired Lee shut up wired Lee or
wirelessly you're so mean connect to a
couple of accessories that HP has so one
is this dock that I forget what it's
called it has a stupid name HP really
needs to learn from Apple have a cool
name pencil have a pretentious name
because for better or for worse it helps
me remember it then aloud that gives you
a display port which by the way can be
adapted to HDMI to full size powered USB
3 ports with device charging capability
one USB type-c connector and a
Kensington lock and then there's
actually a laptop that has no actual
system in it it has a 12 and a half inch
screens keyboard touchpad speakers
headphone jack Ethernet port two full
size USB 3 connectors one USB 3.0 type-c
connector and a 48 watt hour battery
that does not feature its own CPU the
phone actually transmits to the laptop
wirelessly so you can keep it in your
pocket once it is connected to the
laptop very very cool so we'll want a
second line if that sounds awesome and
it sounds like you're amped on this
great point except the reason I'm not
amped is because it needs two more
generations and this is not HP's fault
this is intel's fault for not getting
their head in the game on their mobile
x86 processors tell me about this when
it runs x86 because the beauty of
Windows is the application compatibility
the Achilles heel of Windows Mobile is
the application compatibility I mean as
I was just I was browsing aimlessly on
the internet I came across an article
that the verge did on the apps that are
not only not developing for Windows
Mobile
but pulling their apps and it was like
terrible was like American Airlines like
Pinterest like it was just like
devastating devastating apps that are
discontinuing development or flat-out
pulling their apps from the platform
citing a lack of users as the reason for
it
so until you can tell me about x86 Intel
powered phones I'm really not that
interested but when you can Wow am I
ever excited about this like as someone
who carries around a supremely opie
laptop I also have recognized that other
than my chrome hungry hungry hippo Aang
I don't need that much power when I'm
out and about so something like this
could be fantastic if it has
compatibility for all the stupid junk I
needed to run and is maybe a little bit
more powerful and is maybe a little bit
more powerful because give it to more
generations we're gonna have eight or 16
gigs of ram in it we're gonna have a
more powerful CPU we're gonna have
everything that I can imagine today
wanting although my needs might change
in the next year and year or two Razer
has confirmed they're sending over a
blade stealth we're really late on that
I actually looked back at my emails and
they were like let me get back to you
tomorrow on availability it was like
five weeks ago so today I was like I'm
getting requests to review the blade
stuff like the other people have reviews
up and there's some people with reviews
that are like almost a month old at this
point I'm like yo are you guys sending
one they're like oh oh yeah so so
they're sending it I'm hoping to get my
hands on their core as early as possible
and I'm gonna cut yeah the the external
GPU box oh yeah so I'm gonna kind of dig
a knife into their side be like yeah you
guys got me the blade stealth super late
so I really think I should be the first
with the core this is this is the kind
of stuff that goes on goes on behind the
scenes I I don't know how much they like
me though to be perfectly honest like
Razer like that's the thing is like I'll
I'll play those games but like
ultimately when the device arrives I'm
just gonna say whatever like Razer
razors gotten some pretty bad reviews
here over the years
they've also gotten good ones they've
gotten good ones they've gotten really
good ones at the end of a better job get
a better view
they also with that said they also at
least you know like I don't think they
intentionally snubbed me on the blade
stealth or like we're late on the blade
stealth anything it was probably just a
thing they miss whatever they have a
pretty mature attitude about it when we
say something negative about their
products like that's something that a
lot of a lot of people I think worry
about because we have relationships with
pretty much every company whose products
we review like there's people that we're
gonna have to talk to when we publish a
really negative review and say yeah well
we didn't like it sorry that's that's
the reality and you've done that we've
got some pretty inflammatory stuff back
sometimes the mounting thing with which
one is that the cooler the cooler it was
really hard to install like what the
hell
oh yeah the who made that Detroit yeah
yeah yeah yeah so so stuff like that
like yeah they weren't happy about that
but actually that's not like they
stopped supplying us with review samples
and that's something that I think
viewers I hope viewers should recognize
and understand is that even if we say
something negative and even if they
don't like it the mature companies the
guys like a Corsair or a razor are gonna
continue to deal with us regardless
which i think is better for them better
for us and better for the consumer
because ultimately if the company tries
to control what we say we will make the
decision to either buy the products
ourselves if we think they really need
to be covered or we just won't work with
them anymore and Astro is a perfect
example of that I actually covered that
in a video that I don't believe is
released yet oh but they base straight
up never replied to an email from me
after I released a negative review of
the a 50 which quite frankly is
everything I said it was it's just plain
not very good it was not as good as any
of the other wireless headsets I tested
it against like I'm sorry I don't make
the rules
it's a tag for 20 and it's it's one of
those things where I think it comes down
to the the pedigree of the company as
well like I like to bring up Corsair
because they do a really good job of
being big boys about it when we don't
like something with Corsair for like
Yahoo we don't like
they're like okay what can we do better
yeah that's a good point or no we don't
agree in this is why because their
pedigree is enthusiasts they actually
care if you look back at Astro and I'm
not gonna like I'm not gonna make
disparaging remarks or anything like
that but if you just read their company
history they are literally a branding
firm that is literally their core
business that they did and I believe
still do that they just kind of went oh
well we're really good at this I'm
assuming making assumption okay that it
seems like what they did is they went oh
we're really good at just like taking
something and building a brand around it
so why don't we do that with our own
stuff and so do I necessarily think that
they approached it with the same level
of enthusiasm and engineering adeptness
skill knowledge that someone else might
my perception based on that the product
was straight-up not as good as what
Corsair and Steel series both brought to
the table is no so there you go that's
what I have to say about that I don't
know how I got on that topic when I
aimed let's jump into that Twitter blitz
that I had that I had promised to do
with you guys before so what would you
guys want to see a good vibration mode
it's such a good Fabray shin motor um
anyway PCI Express I can't say I agree
with that one
what was this question uh what modules
do you want to see oh don't forgot the
question but turnip you're correct
huh maybe an installer not upgrade
that's an interesting thought although I
don't think we're antennae limited the
same way we were when we had that pull
up the little thing before we could make
a call more storage ah not you know okay
like if you don't want my crusty storage
like if you want SSD storage then I
could kind of see that yeah seems like
you wouldn't be but you could go okay I
want more storage and battery or maybe
not micro you use the full sizes do you
get like two of them well no if I had
like an SSD sorry SSD no I know but that
would be huge
no no not like two and a half inch SSD
like like like Apple did with
the iPhone six where it's like you want
a little compact SSD I could see that
desktop grade GPU everything you guys
want is terrible I'm sorry better
internet audio module an awesome camera
okay it doesn't really work that way
it's just a module that kind of like
slides into the bottom but to Allie here
like when phonebloks when and f
phonebloks becomes a thing that's the
kind of stuff that that'll do yo no Jono
wants the audio module a physical
keyboard galaxy s7 uses microwaves to be
because of the gear vr yep that makes
perfect sense thank you for pointing
that out that doesn't mean I have to be
happy about it but really some new
decent front-facing speakers okay it's a
little module that slides into the
bottom so I don't know how well that's
gonna work I love you guys but I think
maybe we should have shown a better
picture of the thing that we were doing
thank you for that $1000 HDMI you should
better phone all Linus videos all the
time Milas module windows in vm with
bluetooth mouse and keyboard
okay infrared - microSD - more micro SD
s hang in there Tony
read the reviews off Amazon Oh people
everyone's talking okay so that was one
of our less successful tablets what says
usually you guys have a lot of like
really really great suggestions but it
probably would have helped if I'd shown
better so we're in the chat type C
module the g5 use Type C already let me
check I'm not sure I missed that part
a lot of notes not in my notes so yeah
if it's already got a USB connector and
quite frankly if it supports wireless
charging it's less the the crappy
durability of the micro B is less of an
issue for me a kind of cool though if
the charger for the phone was modular
just in case yeah screw the charger up I
like having it in your pocket and having
it torque or whatever if you did oh well
right yeah it's like yeah I'm eating you
know 60 bucks or whatever overpriced
price tag they want to put on these in
order to buy a whole new phone Before we
jump into our next topic
now's a perfect opportunity to talk
about books each other saying its type C
okay just type C thank you for that then
I thought so but it wasn't in my notes I
couldn't double check fresh books is the
easy to use invoicing software that
helps small businesses look professional
and get paid faster not only will you
look more professional you will be more
professional because it helps you stay
organized about the way that you're
spending your time the way that you
build people and if you just like walk
up with like a paper invoice and go like
please give me a check or cash it
doesn't look nearly as professional if
you have like a system already in place
you look fly by night compared to if you
have like like your credit card and or
you can take cheque yeah yeah looking
flexible is a huge part of looking like
a bigger business like looking like
you're successful is in
it's kind of a funny thing because I
there's got to be people on earth who
would go oh that contractor takes credit
card
therefore he or she must overcharge by
two and a half percent in order to
compensate for the credit card fee
there's probably someone on earth who
literally finds the contractor who only
does paper invoices and checks because
they go that's my kind of cheapskate use
the worst materials to but to the rest
of the world looking like you've got
your stuff together and like that you
can afford to have proper systems in
place for things like invoicing and
payment it really helps your
professional image and gives people more
confidence to book with you so whether
you're doing small-time computer repair
or whether you are teaching dance
lessons or whether you're a plumber or
or just a general laborer or contractor
landscaper FreshBooks lets you keep
track of all that stuff in one place in
the cloud send invoices get read
confirmations so that you know that
they've got your invoices and even
allows people to pay by credit card
through fresh books so if that sounds
great you want to take your business to
the next level get organized save time
spend your time doing the work that
makes the money instead of calculating
the money that you already did work for
then head over to fresh books comm slash
when to claim your free trial today
that's actually the most frustrating
thing when like especially when you're
starting a new business and you're just
like I need to do as much as I possibly
can you don't want to just like sit
there do paperwork nope paperwork
paperwork is a bummer you know what's
not a bummer though squarespace.com
Squarespace is the website builder that
you should use if you want to build a
beautiful website today all you've got
to do is pick from their wide variety of
different templates and whether you want
to build a a blog or a store or a
personal portfolio or any other type of
website that you could possibly want to
build they've even they've got the
they've got the store module actually
built into I believe it's all of the
templates at this point then you should
use one of those Squarespace templates
create your website use the online
builder tool which is so easy
that even I can do it and all and then
since I'm trying to set it up and I can
do it my brains not working today so you
set up your website get it live and the
stability of it in our experience has
been absolutely fantastic if you're
having trouble with it then you should
contact their tech support which is
available 24/7 via live chat and email
and you should head over to
squarespace.com and use offer code Linus
today to save 10% and build your website
for the first two weeks for free to
decide if you should go ahead and extend
it for the full year which by the way
will be including will include a free
domain which is an offer that you should
definitely take advantage of although
you should cons probably taken so
Squarespace you should build it
beautiful
that's difficult not forget for you
that's different it's when my brain is
working faster I'm not having a fast
brain day today yeah when my brain is
working faster I can handle it a lot
will you speed up before the shoot
tonight yeah yeah that's gonna be rough
yeah all right so we've got a video
coming on this you filmed this right the
valve er performance test okay so the
opie is not filled out here original
article here is from kit guru but valve
released their VR performance test it's
there at that portal based demo that
I've got an opportunity to do at CES and
the point of it is basically to
determine if you have the horses to run
in VR with the conclusion being that the
odds are excellent that you indeed do
not Luke's got a video coming out where
he talks about this benchmark as well as
I think you're gonna encourage people to
create a database of yeah so you should
still watch the video but what it really
kind of boils down to is that we have a
fantastic Cinebench community on the
forum I think it's made by jumper one
one eight hopefully I remember that
correctly and it's awesome there's over
500 submissions everyone's and it's
their Cinebench codes I actually look at
that every once in a while just to check
where things are sitting
it's pretty cool and I want to create
the same kind of thing based around
steamvr performance test results figure
out how ready the actual enthusiasts
community is because there's problems
and I go over it in the video yep
because as interesting as this team
Hardware survey is I have a lot of
machines personally yeah a big part of
videos talks about not gaming machines
yeah junk data that's in the hardware
survey which isn't necessarily junk data
for game developers that aren't
developing for VR but how many machines
do you have that you actually intend to
play VR games on probably 1 or 0 and I
have like seven machines in the hardware
survey at least yeah so like I mean with
the number of test benches that I set up
I've got to have dozens in there to be
perfectly honest here all right
the unthinkable has happened Radeon and
GeForce together in DirectX 12 so this
is the dx12 explicit multi-gpu mode and
the way that it supposedly works is that
it takes any DirectX 12 compliant device
and utilizes its resources in the best
way possible
oh wow
in the best way possible for a
performance boost that is not reliant in
any way on SLI or crossfire and can
indeed work across mixed vendor
multi-gpu setups so PC world tested it
out and this feature is gonna is still
invaded by the way but it will make its
debut in ashes of the singularity which
is launching next month and so Gordon MA
PC world benchmarked with the resolution
of 2560 by 1600 with the crazy presets
to GTX 980 s with SLI a single GTX 980 a
single fury X and GTX 980 plus Theory X
the really interesting got the results
here so the GTX 980 plus fury X actually
performed the best at 56 points
frames-per-second with the 980 + 980 s
Li off multi-gpu on outperforming 980 +
980 s Li on now with that said this is
just like an FPS graph FPS average not
like yeah we need PC per yeah we need
this we need captain Shrout to to have a
look at the frame times tell us if
there's stuttering or micro stuttering
or any kind of other anomaly in in this
data that is not evident unless you're
using a frame capture device and and
Nvidia's tool in order to see yeah it's
like something like this where it's a
technology there's a new technology yeah
that we we need a much deeper dive to
figure out what's actually going on and
if NVIDIA could just go okay balls to
the wall here we go we're gonna use all
the processing power of the GPUs I
suspect they would but they've been
really focused like all their messaging
about SLI since the launch of the 980
has been about smoothness butter smooth
consistency of the frame delivery not
necessarily about the frame rate they
deliver good frame rates there's no
doubt of that but that's not what
they're talking about and not what
they're focused on when it comes to
driver and hardware development right
now so it's possible that that frame
rate is not meaningful it's also
possible that this is like bananas and
the coolest thing ever sort of because
there is one big caveat and that is that
the developer has to specifically
implement this feature oh and based on
how many developers even today are still
not working with nvidia and AMD on
crossfire or SLI support never let alone
at lunch like at all
I don't have much hope for this being
like the way forward for gaming and
building your system based around the
idea that whatever game you're gonna
play has this enabled is crazy unless
you only plan to play games that are
already
yeah so yeah this was posted on the
forum by cloaked and the original
article here is from Business Insider a
19 year old made a free robot lawyer
that has appealed three million dollars
in parking tickets in the UK pretty cool
so government super stoked about this
kids robot yeah so that's awesome so
hiring a lawyer for a parking ticket
appeal is not only a headache but can
cost more than just paying the ticket
which is one of the things that they
rely on it's it's way less hassle to
just pay the ticket than it is to try
and fight it however with the help of
this robot created by Joshua Browder who
is 19 years old all you have to do is
give the robot some information and it
asks you these questions and generates
an appeal letter which you then mail to
the court without ever requiring a
lawyer to draft the letter um it can
also help with delayed or cancelled
flights or on payment protection
insurance claims and he's working to
program u.s. city laws into the bots
starting with New York rats for
everything right Browder doesn't think
that robots will be dealing in the US
Supreme Court anytime soon but he says
fewer lawyers will do mundane tasks and
people will save money on stupid little
disputes which I absolutely love not
only that but it learns that's cool yeah
so the more people use the robot the
more intelligent it becomes I guess any
time it fails at something you might
analyze why I'm not sure exactly how it
learns but entrepreneurs are already
talking to Browder about implementing
the bots into cars so I'm not sure
exactly why you would need to be able to
dispute your ticket directly from the I
guess people that want to deal with it
immediately I guess so
or maybe if there's new cars where they
don't just have to put a ticket on your
dash where they can like give your car
the ticket
and then you can dispute it completely
automatically I can't see you know I
can't see in park being that stoked on
that I don't care if in Park you stoked
on anything though yeah me neither so
hate those guys alright we're gonna take
it from them and I hate them
this kind of sucked you were actually in
the middle of working on something that
used Oh my next last week so this is
supposed to by Pandolph on the forum and
the the mint Linux ISO download was
compromised so if you installed mint off
of that ISO it actually had a backdoor
in it can you explain how the crap
something like that happens it wouldn't
even actually be that hard if they had
access to the server where people are
downloading the ISO it was from and they
just replace the ISO with one of theirs
that has extra stuff on it that's and I
mean even the most conscientious
downloader who's checking the md5
checksums I mean if they replace the
heaven t5 checksum on the download
server then you have no way of no way of
checking that the ISO you downloaded is
actually compromised so I was using mint
it doesn't actually matter I could use a
huge array of other things but it's just
frustrating because I had to start not
quite from scratch but I had to
redownload other things and reset up my
whatever and things sucked that video is
not gonna be coming for why doc swag
posted this one on the forum the
original article here is from w CCF Tech
dang it Brandon
ah okay hold on I think our stream
computer is running off of the UPS right
now what just happened no no no we're
not we do have power why doesn't that
have power okay and that's not working
anymore
okay cuz it's not on at all yeah it's
not even going Slightly this looks kind
of cool yeah it's like when shone the
Halloween edition we need I kind of I
kind of like it we should do like
where's way home yeah I want to do like
a spooky story I should do like a really
serious wind show I don't know where
your phone is
anyway so PlayStation VR effectively 60%
more powerful than an equally SPECT PC
apparently very very interesting the way
that they're achieving this is the usual
console advantage so with the lower
level access to the hardware with the
fact that game developers can program
for a specific set of hardware so all
those things that were used to seeing
but there is also some unexpected secret
sauce as well so let's go ahead and and
pull this up so this is so Sony's
Richard Marx held a presentation during
the AR V our vision summit February 10th
to 11th and the presentation provided an
overview of PlayStation VR and the basic
development process
apparently thanks to the fixed hardware
the latency is extremely low we're
talking less than 18 milliseconds which
doesn't sound that low to me there's
some problems with this it's got a 100
degree field of view I I do wonder if
that's a typo in our notes though that
is possible
super low latency of less than 18
milliseconds mind you if that's end to
end if that's end to end that's a pretty
damn impressive yeah that's probably end
to end
okay um 100 degree field of view which
is yeah okay like that's that's not too
shabby I haven't tried project Morpheus
so now the 60% more powerful than same
spec PC point was apparently reported by
middleware providers not Sony and has
also been confirmed by a VR developer on
reddit Brennan I really don't think that
light is on okay
who said psvr is extremely close to
being on par with vive and the rift with
a GTX 970 based on the tests that I've
done Wow so if your app runs at 90 Hertz
on a PS on a PC with a GTX 970 then you
should be very close to 60 on the ps4
and with the 120 Hertz reproduction
applied it is glassy smooth so psvr only
required about one quarter of the render
target size that vive requires the ps4
has hardly any driver overhead compared
to Windows the draw calls on the ps4 are
faster than with DirectX 11 on a PC I
noticed that DirectX 12 is being
conveniently ignored here there's also a
20% buffer for classified techniques
that further reduced the render target
size so the vive render target is 457
million pixels per second so that's 15
12 by 16 80 times 2 times 90 Hertz
whereas the psvr is approximately a
million 1920 by 1080 by 60 -
approximately 20% but we don't know what
that 20% is yeah if I'ma just wait till
they come in yeah I mean to say that a
60 to 120 Hertz up sampling or what what
are they what are they calling
reproduction works well we'll see yeah
we'll see I mean even for video playback
I have found that those kinds of you
know clear motion technologies are very
they're great as long as the motion is
predictable and the processor which by
the way doesn't operate at 18
milliseconds as long as you give that
TVs process or a lot of time and as long
as the motion is predictable can
actually be like wow I didn't know that
there weren't actually more frames in
the original content like very
believable but something is
unpredictable as a game yeah an
interactive medium we'll see yeah I mean
I want to try it that's cool might sound
a little bit weird coming for me but
that would be absolutely fantastic
because right now what VR needs mostly
is just wide adoption so if a huge
amount of PlayStation players get behind
it and then VR becomes a super normal
thing sick yeah great yeah that's
awesome
bring on bring it on to the mainstream
believe it more when I see it
but the opie here is mr. troll and the
Gears of War Ultimate Edition PC against
screenshots file size and requirements
apparently the ideal specs are 16 gigs
of ram with a 980ti
or an r9 390x Wow there though the
minimum specs go down to a 650 Ti and a
260 which is exactly how PC games should
be they should scale all the way down
for people who don't have the horses and
they should scale all the way up for the
people who are investing all this money
into a gaming experience that they want
to have that games refuse to deliver
because of the consoles because the
ideal specs are like a chunk above the
recommended specs yes which is sick yes
super down with that yeah so minimum is
650 Ti with like an AMD FX 6 core or
Core i5 at 2.7 gigahertz recommended is
a GTX 970 which is
actually the highest percentage graphics
card on the Steam Hardware servers yeah
yep so like sure so like I get it okay
I'm stoked cuz I've never played Gears
of War I played one of them very
possibly the first one well I'm stoked
I'm gonna play it I haven't actually
played a game in the last little while
so I'm gonna play that that's my that's
my objective um really interesting
article this one was posted by Patrick
30-27 on the forum original article here
is from TorrentFreak software piracy
hurts Linux adoption research finds most
of the research sometimes it's research
into piracy is focused on determining
how it hurts paid software options like
Microsoft Office or like you know Adobe
Wow can't remember I remember from here
ok so long how this would even be
possible but now I totally get it
yeah so the this this new research
suggests that software piracy has a
detrimental effect on the adoption of
the Linux desktop operating systems and
I would go as far as to say that a that
makes total sense oh yeah and be that
you could say the same thing about any
free software and free software is is
driven by user base they benefit from
whether it's ad supported or whether
it's donation supported the more people
who use it the better and if people run
out and just pirate paid software than
what they're effectively doing is they
are taking the wind out of the sails of
open source or free to you software
developers which is a really interesting
new way to think about that so the way
that they tackled it was they looked at
actually the notes for this one are not
very good but they looked at it on a
regional basis so they went ok this
country has an estimated piracy rate of
this they accounted for factors such as
the GDP of the country and local
anti-piracy efforts and estimated that
the number of Linux users would increase
by 50
percent if all piracy disappears
surprised it's that low I think that a
lot of people pirate simply because they
can
not because they can't afford the
software so I think that's why they're
trying to factor in things like the
country's GDP in averaging I mean I did
I'll admit to that it was completely
because I couldn't afford the software
right like 100 percent I there was no
way
um there it was a mix for me when I did
like there was there was definitely some
i reviews things i straight-up can't
afford this and then there was other
like you know what actually you know
what i did pay for vista oh no I wasn't
gonna say stuff like Windows Vista was
like yeah I'm gonna use this for like a
bid and I'm probably gonna go back to XP
so III did pay I didn't pay for this
difficult I liked mr. it was fine
computer yes I did I don't want to get
into that conversation and that's the
