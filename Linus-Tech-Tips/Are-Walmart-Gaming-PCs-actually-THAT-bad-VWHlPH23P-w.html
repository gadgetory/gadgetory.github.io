pcs in Canada but there's no way that
that was gonna prevent us from getting
our hands on the next generation of
overpowered gaming PC now I have heard
through the grapevine that the Walmart
gaming desktop PC as they call it might
not be all that it was cracked up to be
but I have intentionally sequestered
myself I have not watched gamers Nexus
or bit whit's content on this so that I
can experience it for the first time in
all of its glory for myself now Ivan you
have already peaked under the hood have
you not don't I send Boyle it's AI and
this video is brought to you by huh no
I'm just kidding the be quiet silent
bass 801 it offers great usability and
utilizes noise dampening vents to keep
your PC quiet
check it out on Newegg at the link in
the video description
now my first impressions of Walmart's
overpowered lineup of gaming pcs was
what followed shortly by dang those are
some pretty good specs for the price
like that's very competitive much better
than I expected
also the configurations made a ton of
sense to me it was almost like they had
gone out of their way to find someone
who knows what the crap they're doing to
configure their systems for them I mean
i7 8700 processor ok it okay it's not
overclockable or whatever but like
that's fine it's a prebuilt gtx 1070 16
gigs ram 256 gig SSD like it looks like
the kind of thing that I would put
together for you know $1500 or so
opening up the package we get a actually
not terrible looking QuickStart guide
certainly seen worse connect your power
connect HDMI or a DisplayPort on the
graphics card they specify which one to
use but they don't actually have a great
diagram of that oh boy
that's not right connect your PC through
their net cable to hardwire your device
not particularly descriptive mistakes oh
I didn't even notice that in terms of
accessories we've got a adequate quality
looking power connector a piece of
velcro like double sided velcro stuff
presumably for stashing this somewhere
and then you can grab it off with velcro
I guess that's your RGB thing okay so
more opie posters to hang in my room
because i'm opie like that like what is
this is this this is water so you're
going to be like overwhelmed by the
penis over it and you just gonna be like
oh did you just say overwhelmed by the
penis of it Opa Opa Opa Opa this is a
pretty cookie cutter or sort of vinyl
decal here but it's better than
absolutely nothing which is what a lot
of system integrators do these are more
expensive than you'd think so to make
our performance test as fair as possible
Ivan has actually sourced an identically
configured pre-built system
from those HP guys so that we can get
some idea of whether it performs as
expected out of the box let's start with
that although one thing that does give
me pause before I even get that far is
the non powder-coated power supply it's
just got like a simple gray back I
remember asking a power supply
manufacturer how much it costs to
powdercoat a power supply and I think it
was somewhere in the neighborhood of
like tens of cents so it's not usually a
good sign when they save that tens of
cents on an aesthetic coating even
though in fairness it doesn't contribute
to performance we're gonna have to look
at it a little more closely once we open
it up actually this is bizarre - I've
never seen this before a USBC on a
little like daughter how would they put
it way up there now just to double-check
this is configured the same as this are
there are there any key differences no
which is more specifically I picked the
system okay go head-to-head and price
difference is about hundred bucks
this is 1,400 this is 15 ok here we go
it's got RGB color changing works as
expected
Oh in the back the back fan is RGB too
what can happen sometimes in shipping is
okay well I've never seen it like that
before
later Hawaii because leches yeah this
just looks like they outright forgot to
plug it in like I'm trying to think of
what the workflow wow that is the
cheapest looking motherboard maybe not
that I've ever seen but Wow is it ever
damn close you know how they say first
impressions last a lifetime this is not
a good first impression holy it I just
noticed that the only onboard video
output is VGA I mean not that it matters
we wouldn't be using the onboard video
but like what year is it
oh the years right here manufacturer
date October 2018 no I didn't go back in
time I just thought I did because that
was a VGA connection on there all right
what game are we starting with or should
we just start with like a CPU stress
test yeah yeah the synthetics ok
Cinebench okay we're in the homestretch
here and this is about his neck and neck
as I think I could imagine it being okay
yeah $1.99 for the Walmart overpow WOD
PC $1.99 for our omen okay now let's try
multi-core interestingly our overpowered
PC actually came out ahead in this one
1312 well you want to punish it alright
fine I mean it's fair i bt is a fair
test so I'm gonna open task manager as
well just so we can verify that our CPU
is 100% loaded ok so right now I'm at
four point two eight gigahertz what are
you at four point two nine okay keep in
mind this guy's it there for monitoring
as well okay my system took longer to
start the test no it's it's being it's
being hit now it's all loaded into Ram
I'm at four point one gigahertz oh I'm
running faster than you so have they
configured this system to use an all
core turbo on those VRMs
now the thing to note is that our Olman
desktop is actually adhering to Intel's
spec while this one is technically kind
of overclocked in a way that some
aftermarket motherboards will be
configured out-of-the-box to operate
something to note though is that while
ours seems to be working fine even in an
all cores loaded stress test your
mileage may vary
we might get a really good CPU that
handles all core turbo just fine your
system might be unstable
I mean we can only judge what's in front
of us though and so far this thing is
managing 4.1 gigahertz all cores loaded
on its 8,700 and with temps that are in
the 50 degree or so range to put that in
context that's probably about 35 degrees
above ambient it is pretty chilly in
here today no the front ports are all
USB - that's why they have that weird
USB 3 thing out the back what what why
would they how can you ship a system in
2018 with USB 2 front ports that's why
they had the internal header free for
that weird thing at the back they don't
have front USB 3 what is this why did
they create 4 partitions for the hard
drives
what possible thing purpose could that
serve they do know that partitioning a
hard drive doesn't do anything right
like with respect to reliability ease of
organizing files why would you do that
maybe make it easier for people to come
parth mentalize their files like hold a
folder now we're not judging game
loading times here just because shadow
of the tomb Raider's installed on a hard
drive here in an SSD here so let's
ignore that but that doesn't affect
gaming performance oh we were wrong
about that so I don't know maybe it's to
do with the fact that we're loading new
scenes of the game so frequently anyway
the point is we've got all
games on the SSDs for both systems now
let's click run and let's see them side
by side baby everything's looking pretty
normal so far this one actually seems to
be maybe running a touch faster but I
guess holy crap so I went to change the
color and it turns out there's like a
bazillion different patterns if you keep
pressing this LED thing like I swear
I've been through 50 different patterns
at least already what the crap
this is about as RGB doubt as I think it
like what is this I will give them
credit the system actually looks pretty
sharp and pretty clean I mean for now
the only issue is that these intakes are
completely unfiltered so that's gonna
look like ass pretty quickly but anyway
anyway we've got it it comes down to the
results let's have a look
average FPS 86 mins look reasonably and
things do not get any better in
Assassin's Creed origins that this is an
ultra 1080 so everything looks fine 63
FPS compared to 71 okay yeah that's an
improvement but if you look a little
closer the CPU frame times are 15
milliseconds whereas our CPU over here
is 9 so you can clearly see the GPU is
the difference so that's where our
frames per second actually isn't that
much higher over here but our CPU is
performing way better for some reason ok
bringing us to our last one Deus Ex same
thing here if all we look at this is
exactly why you can't just trust average
frame rates eighty seven point eight
versus eighty eight point two over here
but the minimums are over ten frames per
second lower that is like 15
tene person probably about 15% that is
nuts
okay let's get the HP out of here and
let's tear this thing down so take this
no knots you can leave it here now this
will be the first time that we're taking
off the other side panel so there's a
few things I really don't like here
number one that is a single 16 gig stick
of RAM I understand the argument to be
made for upgradability but single
channel memory oh I wonder if that's
what's killing our CPU performance
anyways single channel memory cuts your
bandwidth effectively in half also these
wires I don't know what better way to
describe them then as Pinner these are
really thin wires these are providing
all the power for your motherboard we do
get an 8 pin connector for our CPU so I
guess that's probably a relatively good
sign look again wait what oh no
nevermind it's an 8 pin connector on a 4
pin on the board can they get something
right here ok that's far from the worst
cable management I've seen like this is
the weird thing about this whole
experience is that there's these
sprinklings of competence but then
somehow they've ended up with an end
result that is underperforming for the
hardware that's in it by this very
significant margin and that just has
these confounding least stupid errors
bhop need on the USB 3 connector why
would they do that that's not even a
connector that is generally known to
come out if anything these things can be
so hard to remove that you can end up
ripping the housing off the board when
you try to unplug them what a strange
thing to do and then they didn't even
hot glue this one it's what like there's
just these weird sort of moon logic
things going on here we're like if we
see this as a concern that needs to be
rectified by hot glue why is it a
concern here
but not here it's the same connector
alright it's not super light but it's
also a great wall unit who aren't really
known for making amazing OAM power
supplies so it's a 500 watt unit of
which 21 of the 45 amps on the 12 volt
rail are dedicated to the CPU apparently
and then you've got 24 amps left over
for i/o whatever that means so it's a 2
rail power supply which means that you
can't have any more than about 300 ish
watts now there is one more thing that
we can have a look at here let's see how
good of a job they did of their thermal
compound application frankly I don't
know what to expect because some stuff
has been done to a reasonable degree of
competence like the cable management
honestly considering that the parts for
this system only come to about $60 less
than this completed system so we're only
charging a 60 bucks for assembly like
that is definitely a $60 assembly job
for sure it's I consider it quite
adequate but then there's other things
like not having the graphics card
plugged in that are just unbelievable
yeah no concerns there this was probably
the pre applied thermal compound on this
heatsink though so it's a little bit of
a heavy application but it's quite thin
where these direct contact heat pipes
actually touch the integrated heat
spreader so I really I mean I have no
concerns there and I didn't see anything
about the thermal performance of the
system that raised red flags and that's
the thing is I think the bottom line
here is that I just even though they're
not really making it a huge amount of
margin on this thing and they're not
charging an unreasonable amount for what
you get there's just these gross errors
in the configuration of it that make it
impossible to recommend USB to ports on
the front panel what is that and the
motherboard
it needs a significant upgrade so that
you don't have to give up performance in
order to get upgrade ability you should
be using a proper board with four memory
slots and while you're at it a little
bit more expandability like what it
really feels like to me
is that they blew the motherboard and
power supply budget on RGB lighting and
I get that RGB slice for gamers but
first and foremost gamers need
performance and stability and right now
this system just has too many red flags
for me to possibly recommend it and this
whole thing is unfortunate because I had
really wanted to be the contrary in' you
know I thought maybe Steve was being too
nitpicky or something not that Steve
would ever nitpick on it you know a
minor technical detail not Steve but I
thought maybe he was being nitpicky or
something like that but I'm just in a
position where I I'm just not
