months after we first teased the concept
of building the first ever Linus Media
Group gaming lounge and ironically
pretty much everything else about this
space is done so we've got our side
people here this just arrived it's still
got all the protective stuff on it we've
got our board games table here this is
actually a bit of a placeholder but
whatever we could play board games we've
got the media lounge that is like it's
freaking awesome and the one part we
haven't actually started on yet is the
actual land gaming center
fortunately oh my god so it's time for
us to finally build the first real
system except that we had a small
problem we were having trouble getting
the core i7 processors that we had
intended to use from our prototype
system way back when so we figured you
know what well we're only running our TX
27 TS anyway would AMD really be that
much of a performance compromise here
well there's only one way for us to find
out the mas grande backpack is the
perfect companion for laptops of up to
17 inches since the bag is
water-resistant and padded for
protection also it has an orange
interior check it out at the link below
so before we get into building our
actual final spec rig I guess a bit of a
haul video is kind of an order here
isn't it man this is a lot of hardware
every system is getting a G 903 no it's
it's actually worse a little we went
even further over the top those are
extras every system is getting one of
Logitech's Pro wireless gaming mice okay
as if half the people that are gonna be
using it or even skilled enough to know
the difference everyone's getting a g5
13 carbon with their Romer G linear
switches everyone's getting a g9 35
headset and thanks to Logitech's recent
acquisition of Blue Microphones a Yeti
nano mic because you know the built-in
headset mic I mean we've got it it's not
like it's not a super high-end headset
but if we're gonna use an off board like
you know whatever then moving into the
systems themselves
we're running rise in 2700 X processors
so yes we lose a little bit of
single-threaded performance compared to
the 8700 k's we initially expect but we
can probably overclock them a little and
quite frankly in the eSports titles that
we'll be running for the most part I
don't expect it to make a difference
although we will be testing that out
today and then cooling them we're gonna
be using H 100 i RGB platinum water
coolers from corsair we're gonna be
pairing them with 16 gigs each of ddr4
26 66 megahertz RGB ram from also
corsair every system gets an MP 300 480
gig boot drive do we have hard drive
strings yes and often
oh nice everyone's getting a Brio 4k pro
webcam so everything's gonna be stream
ready all the optin oh wow okay so
that's pretty cool that means our 480
gig SSD is gonna handle OS duties and
any critical applications and then our
hard drives are actually gonna have
accelerated caching so that the games
that are played most frequently even if
they are on magnetic storage are still
gonna load faster than if they were just
on a hard
also pulling cooling duty course are
sent over a hold on to their light loop
120 fans first let's talk about what
they're gonna be driving so a soos sent
over 12 of their VG to 79 gaming
monitors so these are 1080p IPS with 3
millisecond response times and they run
at a hundred and forty four Hertz
so these are basically your kind of no
frills but still looks really great
gaming monitor they don't have D sync
but now that Nvidia has enabled g-sync
on free sync displays we're not
expecting that to be a problem for our
GeForce r-tx
2070 graphics cards the whole thing's
gonna be hooked into a Seuss's top
Series B 450 m+ gaming motherboard and
installed in a crystal serious - ATX
case from Corsair for power we've gone
way over the top see sonic sent over
their prime titanium 1,000 watt modular
power supply I told them like 750 Plus
this is literally three times the power
we actually need but cool thanks hi guys
actually a couple things I forgot minor
details AK want you sent over there 10
gig NICs so guys we don't expect this to
make a difference to the actual gaming
experience but while installing games
off our steam caching server which you
can check out the video about up here
this will definitely make a difference
while we're pulling down from all these
machines at once so that's gonna be sick
and these chairs from Max anomic so we
haven't actually reviewed one of their
chairs in quite some time but this is
still my daily driver in my office
actually not quite this one but a
similar model and I'm super excited that
when we're here for hours after work
we're gonna be sitting on something as
comfortable as their classic office
chair we've got the black one right Jake
yeah and it's embroidered oh that looks
awesome
as the kids would say I'm not a kid
anymore I'm not saying it I just want to
hear you sit it's late it's late yeah
yeah yeah thank you thank you you're
gonna say damn it I said it okay so
while deke puts together a couple of the
chairs which we're gonna need for our
head-to-head mano a mano gaming session
I'm gonna put together one of our final
AMD based rigs so we can find out when
we put it head-to-head against our
original Intel based prototype over here
how much if any performance we're
leaving on the table with our 2,700 X's
you know what I think I'm gonna mix
things up for this build I'm gonna start
by getting everything ready in the case
then I'm gonna put together my core
platform on my motherboard here I
haven't even gotten as far as putting
the fans into the case and we've already
found a problem because we changed from
an Intel board to an AMD board sort of
midway through this project we might
have overlooked a small compatibility
issue now it's nothing sort of game
ending here we still have room for our
triple slot graphics card and our 10
gigabit NIC but what we are losing is
the ability to put in our obtained
module because this board only has a
single m2 slot and yeah there's no
additional one on the back or anything
like that
yeah that's a little disappointing
actually hey so Jake how are we
arranging the fans on these things
because we can either design it for
optimal airflow and have to in two out
or we can have our light loop rings all
visible externally and it can look
badass and then it'll be like highly
positive pressurized but but they're all
filtered - into out - into out yeah you
got a
better than the system's overheating
he's not gonna do it I just wanted to
check something real quick with you
though however I build this first one
that's how we'll have to build all of
them right well I could always just fix
it alright I guess this one is done now
hey not bad pretty good man I mean it's
just I have this exact same chair at my
desk
oh yeah a MIMO sent over there so they
don't actually sell a complete desk big
yourself do they yeah that's not what we
got we needed a big one that's not the
one that I bought the other week you
know yeah they sell just like a standing
sitting like leg assembly so that's what
we're gonna be putting these custom
dbrand skinned MDF tabletops on top of
I'm actually super stoked for how good
that's gonna look those things are
really happy please be careful so this
is a pretty cool little piece of kit
this is a Corsair commander Pro and it
plugs in using SATA for power and then
USB for data and then it's got all your
LED ports here you've got up to 6 fans
that you can plug in directly
it's got temp sensors right here and
then 2 USB internal headers in case you
have a motherboard that only has one and
then you're taking it up with this thing
well this way you can plug your front
panel USB 2 into this or any other
accessories like say for example one of
course there's own CPU coolers which we
are probably going to need to do in this
case so we're gonna replace our existing
fan hub with this guy yeah cable
management pan I tell you the adhesive
that they used to hold the original LED
and fan controllers in is ridiculous
just barely get that thing off sounds
like something a beta male would say
what are you gonna cry - you know what
you take it off show me how it's done
alpha guy oh man that's pretty on there
oh it was really loosened a lot
uh-huh why did they put that much
adhesive on look I love you guys of
course sorry great
great people sent us a lot of hardware
for this project okay yeah we're going
full RGB ring this here it's taking me
as long to do the RGB wiring as it would
to build a normal computer of course
it'll be all worth it but like we've got
the - we've got the commander Pro we've
got the RGB hub we've got the the leads
for all the strips and all the fans -
power leads for the whole thing I think
we're finally ready to put a motherboard
in it look at the chairs though but the
chairs are done you know the funny thing
is I've always just kind of used
whatever like brand loyalty is not a
thing for me but because the community's
perception of me as some kind of fanboy
one way or the other is so strong it
feels a little bit naughty building an
AMD system see check this out this is
what I love about this case this side
like look at that it's that look clean
or what and then this side in typical
Linus fashion I'm like getting pretty
close here actually I just got a pop the
power supply in wire that up and then I
need my graphics card network card and
then I'm good to go I don't know who
would use this as a standing desk but
maybe if you're like an NBA player or
something well I wasn't sure if I could
do it but after giving it my best effort
I think I've succeeded in making the
contrast between my cable manage side
and mine on cable manage side even more
stark good job Linus it's a real shame
about that video card sag äj-- that's
actually not that bad it's not great I
was expecting it to be a lot worse than
that I'm okay I'm also a little upset
about the one yellow accent can you just
get the T out of there finish the T off
so it's just off gaming gaming for
gamers you have to do this like like
this yeah I guess otherwise it's not you
don't get the white out look otherwise
it's just how beta his his writing game
is here
look at its gorgeous thanks to Aki for
sending these mousepad XL mouse pads
very nice with the braided edge this is
the moment we've all been waiting for
hey nice okay so my nick is showing up
my 16 gigs of ram is all showing up my
hard drive is not showing up oh it might
be a SAS Drive I just grabbed something
off the shelf because our drives didn't
actually arrive ok I will figure that
out later but we still have a couple
things to do here so I'm going to set
our do CP so that's AMD's XMP equivalent
which should configure our ram to its
optimized settings and then install
windows so this is it this finished AMD
system versus not the old concept Intel
system on a test bench I mean really the
point of all of this is to find out how
much we compromised by going AMD so I
think we're 2 and 2 right now aren't we
Jake is that does that sound right
also I'm pretty sure that while I was
pretty far behind before you're dead
again and my kill count is pretty close
oh oh would you look at that am I out
ahead now ha cuz I remember you talking
some smack about how you're like a young
hip gamer or something oh nice
performance-wise oh it's it's not making
a difference what are you at in terms of
fps Oh like around 300 250 250 it really
depends on where you are in the map yep
I'm anywhere from like 150 to 250 ok
we're here this means it's me it's me ok
so let's just look down look down the
thing I just want to know what the FPS
is difference is like okay
mine's higher what yeah yours is quite a
bit higher actually thing in the
background no I mean remember csgo is a
notoriously intel favoring game so yes
there's a difference but like
I didn't feel for a second like I was
affected by the difference and you know
when we're talking a hundred and fifty
versus yeah it made one hundred and
forty FPS I'm alright with it
okay I wanna try a different game DG you
can't all time out of this game yeah I
won okay man I haven't played on 1080p
in a hot minute it's a little different
than 1440 PL Troy yeah like it's it's
like a 10 FPS difference well remember
csgo was behind so I was thinking about
it was that good but like csgo was
behind in the context of like a hundred
and sixty versus 240 FPS like it's not I
don't know it wasn't that much I feel
like it was like thirty oh there's two
crap okay well sorry no the frame rates
are good I mean yeah dang it you did
more damage alright alright so you're
better at the game that only you play
but I don't play so okay that's good
that's good so then that's our takeaway
Jake isn't actually that great at video
games in spite of being one of the young
kids actually depending on you know what
game you're playing you might even get a
better gaming experience with the 2700 X
which did surprise me an apex legends
anyway that's like 100 bucks cheaper no
regrets then now we just have to build
eleven more that's my regret I only
regret is doing it eleven time to having
this idea all right so I guess all
that's left now other than preparing
ourselves to do this 11 more times is to
