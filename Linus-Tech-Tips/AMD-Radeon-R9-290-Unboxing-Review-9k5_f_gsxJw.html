learn more now I have to admit I feel
like AMD was trolling us reviewers a
little bit with the release of the 290 X
in the 290 and I guess I've been
trolling you guys a little bit lately
with unboxings that don't have boxes in
them so I am going to rectify that by
showing you the box that the Radeon r9
290 came in unboxing the card and then
proceeding to get on with the review of
the card which for something like this
where quite frankly that's what you
should do with the box then install it
in your system and enjoy it enjoy the
gaming bliss that comes with it is
probably what you should do as well now
what do I mean by trolling us well I
mean the card works and it's great
that's all fine and good but what AMD
did is they released two cards that are
pretty much the same thing days apart so
that we get to make separate videos
outlining pretty much the same
information twice in a row so if you
guys have watched the 290x video you
probably already know most of what I'm
about to say so go ahead and skip
forward to the performance numbers which
are where this card is really going to
prove its worth
price to performance my friends so
without further adieu it uses the same
GCN architecture as the previous Edition
7000 series as well as the Xbox one and
the PlayStation 4 meaning that AMD's is
their API called mantle is going to be
able to borrow a lot of the development
principles that go into making console
games and bring them to the PC so a more
bare to metal programming approach that
should give AMD's cards when they're
running the mantle API and the game has
to specifically support it the first
one's going to be battlefield 4 a huge
performance advantage it's got over 6
billion transistors and unlike the 290 X
is clocked at only 947 megahertz maximum
vs. 1 gigahertz for the 290 X and it has
its stream processors cut down a little
bit - so it has 2560 stream processors
other than that it is pretty much the
same card it has four gigs of ram
running on a 512 bit bus so these cards
are
design for high resolution gaming that
is to say two and a half K or four K or
you might as well go for something like
a to ATX unless you really want to crank
up the anti-aliasing completely through
the roof or be ready for you know
next-generation games at 1080p it's not
designed for 1080p my friends it has a
newer optimized fan profile but that
doesn't change the fact that it is a
little bit on the louder side the good
news is that when it ramps up and ramps
down it does so much more smoothly than
their previous generation fan controller
design it has their new updated power
tune technology that factors in the GPU
clock the voltage the temperature and
the power consumption in order to give
you as much perf performance as possible
out of the card at any given time now
this changes the way overclocking works
so they have a new graphical user
interface for overclocking where
basically instead of overclocking to a
frequency now you overclock based on a
percentage and you give the card
thresholds within which to work where
you say okay I'm okay with this much
more than the recommended power and I'm
okay with this much more than the
recommended clock speed do your best and
then the card will deliver to you
whatever it can although our 290x review
revealed that there wasn't much
overclocking Headroom on that card maybe
we find out that things are a little bit
different here speaking of not much
overclocking Headroom they come dialed
in at 95 degrees don't be surprised when
your to 90 or 290x runs at 95 degrees
Celsius under load this is by design AMD
is switching voltages and clock speeds
about every 10 microseconds in order to
squeeze as much performance out of the
card as possible if you don't like it
just like in videos GPU boost 2.0
technology to just turn it down just use
the slider say okay I'm only comfortable
with 80 degrees AMD saying it's not
going to affect the longevity of the
card they probably know better than us
but hey who knows heat does make
integrated circuits die eventually so
there you go whatever you're comfortable
with dial it in at that it'll just turn
down the performance of the card a
little bit or you can choose to ramp up
the fan speed a little bit more if you
want speaking of fan speed there's quiet
mode and uber mode so there's a switch
on the top of the card towards the back
of the card towards the fan is uber mode
that is what we use for our testing what
you also might have noticed looking
close up at the card right
there's there are no crossfire
connectors all the crossfire
communication is done through that PCI
Express 16x interface down there at the
bottom it's pcie 3.0 ready but don't
worry even if you're running pcie 2.0 8x
slots andy hasn't observed any
performance difference between running
connectors and not running connectors so
the rest of the card physically this is
fascinating here at the back to DVI port
hdmi and displayport no analog output
whatsoever not even with adapters but
what's cool is you can run eyefinity
using any of these three ports now and
up to 6 displays using a DisplayPort hub
off of a single card without needing a
specific fancy special Eyefinity 6
Edition card it takes one six pin and
one eight pin power connector and it has
a pretty sexy looking shroud overall
there's not much to see on the back of
the card because all of the memory chips
are actually soldered on the front of
the card a bit of an unusual design for
something that has 16 memory chips on
which is a requirement if you're going
to have a 512 bit memory bus because it
actually reads and writes to every one
of those chips all at the same time and
that's how you're able to achieve the
massive bandwidth that AMD has with this
particular graphics card so they've also
got trueaudio built into this card the
260 X and the 290 X that is a dedicated
onboard digital sound processor that
will allow games to leverage it if they
take advantage of it there's middlewares
that are going to support it it's really
going to depend on dev support and right
now there's only three cards that
actually have true audio Hardware on
them so it might not be as relevant for
now but in the future it will be a less
cloudy and more CPU resource efficient
way to implement much much better audio
that's more immersive in games and I
appreciate AMD being a pioneer in the
whole graphics card audio thing I mean
they were the first ones to put audio
over HDMI on a graphics card way back in
the day as well another note on mantle
guys is much lighter audio it depends on
developer support so mantle can
potentially dramatically improve the
performance not only of this card but
also 7000 series cards but we've yet to
see a game engine that actually
implements it yet once it's done it
might be as simple as for end-users
automatically detecting your AMD GCN
graphics card or even just being a drop
down and giving you like huge
performance improvements but until we
actually see anything
it's really
really hard for us to say now I'm going
to hand off to Luke to give you guys the
performance numbers before we start I
cannot emphasize this enough please
listen to me we run all of our graphics
cards overclocked that is why our
numbers are different from other
reviewers I hope that was clear enough
if you have any curiosities about the
kinds of over clocks that we're running
on the cards we will link our
overclocking master sheet under the
video so you can see exactly what clock
speeds were at our 290x
wasn't a particularly great overclocker
in our in our 290x review it wasn't that
bad either I mean it was functional it
did overclock a little bit it wasn't as
bad as our old 7870 but you know we had
people saying that we were putting it up
against the gtx 780 lightning we weren't
that was just a standard gtx 780
reference card that wasn't a
particularly great overclocker we're
looking into ways we can tweak this
methodology maybe using something like
average over clocks on Hardware bought
on every card or something along those
lines but the cold hard truth is we are
not changing the way we run overclocked
cards because we feel that it is the one
thing that we can do a little bit
differently here versus everyone else
who is running the card stock if your
complaint is everyone else runs the card
stock why are your numbers different why
are you even looking at our numbers if
you know they're not going to be
different if you want to see stock
benchmarks go to any one of you
literally 100 to 200 other review sites
that run the Magpul look at them there
without further ado here's slick so the
first thing you're going to notice is
that the r9 290 did really well like
really really well like better than 290
X well and a little bit more research
into this topic brought up that what
likely happened was I got a not super
great overclocker for my 290 X and a
really really good overclocker for my
290 how we're going to address this in
the future is we're going to continue to
have me overclock the cards as hard as I
can right when I first get them because
we won't have any averages and we don't
know how well they overclock immediately
so on the launch video it'll be as hard
as I can get it for overclocked and then
after that we're going to go with
hardware bought averages so in the
future after a bunch of people have
gotten the card and after a bunch of
people have submitted averages to
Hardware bots we will actually be
adjusting our cards to that in the past
we had kept it with the launch
overclocked to make it consistent
throughout all of our testing but we
believe that going with the hardware
bought averages will be more
representative of what the average
consumer will get in the field so what
are your takeaways knowing that we're
going to start rebalancing for Hardware
bots and knowing that we're going to
swap out the 290x for one that can
overclock a little bit closer to
hardware bot levels in the future thank
you Asus we're going to be getting an
aftermarket one from them I don't know
when we're in line for it so that'll be
good the 290 is extremely hot it's
extremely loud it consumes a very large
amount of power and it crushes
benchmarks if you can deal with the
power consumption if you can deal with
the heat if you can deal with the sound
it's a really powerful card at a really
good price point and that's just
something people are going to want to
deal with it's pulling more power in a
lot of situations than a 480 for those
of you guys that remember for ATS that
is pretty insane but this thing is very
powerful for its price if you have a
high price point and you want to
purchase the king of this generation you
have a little bit of waiting left to do
mantle and 780ti are still yet to flex
their muscles and we're not sure exactly
how this battle is going to play out but
if you're looking at around a $400 gafas
card it might be decision time now if
you liked the video like the video if
you just liked the video dislike the
video and in the comments below what's
your trade-off are you going for a
really heavy crazy performance but
taking in power consumption heat and
sound or are you going for the more
all-around comfortable experience with
maybe a little bit less performance
leave that in the comments below and as
always please subscribe to Linus tech
