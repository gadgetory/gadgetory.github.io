XCOM hey guys I got by - the topper
booth I had to check these guys out as I
haven't actually typed on Topor in real
life I know a lot about toppers but I've
never actually typed on one there toper
real forest boards as we see right here
can range anywhere around 300 bucks
Tober switches are basically a hybrid
capacitive switch that have a spring
under a rubber dome and they're known as
some of the best switches money can
actually buy they have a better gradient
weight pressed down than reds and blacks
duan MX cherry switches you might be
wondering why I'm saying this as I own
many MX cherry boards I also want a
buckling spring I hope to own a topper
at some point but it's just the fact of
it now if we move away from the 380
board that is out as most people most
people's price points you can get to
this one this is in the mid $100 so
you're getting a 100 - I think 150 to
180 around there I got I just got some
nods so apparently that's right you're
still getting the topper switch you're
still getting what these keyboards are
really really known for but the printing
is not quite as high quality as the old
real forces and the plastics used in
this in the key caps is abs instead of
PBT so what they saved on was actually
the key caps not the switches which is
really the typing experience personally
I have cherry MX keyboards but with
custom PBT caps so I do really really
like my caps but the cost of entry of
getting one of the new type heaven
topper keyboards is much much much
cheaper than the old real forces and is
actually bringing them in to a more
common consumer market instead of before
where they're just very very very
high-end keyboards this is very very
exciting as mechanical keyboards
especially in the United States I'm from
Canada but especially in the United
States are becoming much much more
popular you now have another option
other than just Cherry keyboards so if
you really like mechanical keyboards but
have not found a cherry switch that is
exactly to your liking now you can get a
topper this is absolutely great I'm very
very happy to see the type heaven if you
want to see all the rest of our Computex
