isn't exactly new I mean most flagship
phones whether you're talking your s7s
or your iPhone sevens whatever the case
may be they're designed to go bloop into
the water yay look at that they survived
it's amazing oK we've all seen this
before
but what if you could waterproof a
computer hard drive impractical yes
impossible let's find out
Corsairs 570 X mid-tower case features 4
tempered glass panels check it out at
the link in the video description so the
first and most obvious problem we need
to solve is the exposed PCB that you'll
find on the bottom of pretty much any
modern harddrive if you know a thing or
two about water you'll know that while
it starts non electrically conductive as
soon as it starts to pick up any
impurities or metal ions it quickly
becomes conductive and will cause any
electronic devices that are submerged in
it for long enough to short out and/or
be permanently damaged so I pick myself
up a can of Mg chemicals conformal
coating number 4 19 C 340 G it's die
lean free toluene free low vo C if
you're into that sort of thing but more
importantly it protects against moisture
dirt dust and apparently thermal shocks
and insulates against high-voltage arcs
shorts and static discharge so step one
is we are going to treat our PCB with
this stuff okay so let's get started you
got any old hard drive you want and go
to town right wrong so most hard drives
today are actually full of good
old-fashioned air and they've got these
breather ports that allow them to stay
at the same internal pressure as the
atmosphere around them this is
imperative for their functionality and
this is actually the reason why even
when you submerge them in a non
conductive fluid like a mineral oil
cooled computer we have a bill blog that
you can check out here where we actually
explained all of this they would still
cease to work because through these
breather ports the mineral oil or any
other fluid would seep in and gunk up
the internals of the hard drive but
there's been a recent development in
hard drive technology that leads me to
believe that perhaps we could run a
drive submerged in fluid this is a
Seagate Barracuda pro it is a
helium-filled drive now the point of
helium-filled drives was more efficient
operation since helium is less dense
than air
you're spinning the spindles around
there's less resistance but it also
means they had to seal the insides of
the drags because if the helium got out
then you would lose the benefit right so
this is the drive that I will be using
99% isopropyl alcohol and blue don't
worry kids this is definitely safe I've
done this many times I'm a professional
now let's make ourselves somewhere to
spray because I think the spray booth is
over in the other side I have to assume
this stuff wouldn't be very good to
inhale so don't breathe okay check this
up so I sprayed the crap out of it like
it is pretty pretty gooped on there and
it's actually like built up around the
outsides of these chips so what I'm
hoping is we have achieved the water
resistance that we need and done so
without damaging the ability of this
thing to make contact with the places it
has to so this is where it gets really
sketch well those are all definitely
worn so we're going to reinstall this on
the hard drive and test it outside
before we try to put it in the water
mm-hmm
hmm so it's possible that the painting
that I did on the PCB covered up these
metal contacts for data and power so
we're just going to give it the OL have
you tried unplugging it and plugging it
back in repeatedly try and scrape those
connectors clean that does seem to be
making a difference I don't know if you
can see that close up there but you can
see the conformal coating is coming up I
don't even think it's spinning up yeah
this drive is definitely not powered up
okay so it's a power issue it can work
with that
get out the OL scraper just go at it a
bit more aggressively here I can't
imagine just spraying conformal coating
on it would have destroyed it found the
problem there were three contact points
under here that I didn't send the ones
for power for the motor so of course
it's not spinning up mmm let's go ahead
and give that the old you know hard
drive sanding technique yes okay there
it is there's our 10 terabyte drive okay
so it's time
time for what time to figure out what
data I can copy for a test I am
basically going to take the drive and
put it in order see what happens what
the hell is this okay so it's some kind
of land issue I will deal with that
later in the meantime I've got a USB
type-c Ethernet adapter here and I've
started three transfers each of like 2.3
terabytes worth of data so you can see
here we are transferring to the
adventure drive from the network so this
should take quite some time now this is
where it gets real so I'm going to take
this drive which is currently writing
data and ever so carefully cautiously
and not at all recklessly oh this pains
me I'm actually in pain right now okay I
am liquid cooling the hard drive
okay I'm halfway in
about 3/4 of the way in is it still
transferring
still going let's go get some more water
okay so to absolutely prove that there's
no smoke and mirrors that's not mineral
oil here's a new jug look tap water tap
water AF top it up still transferring
but don't take the camera off me we're
proving this as a continuous shot here
we go okay tap water AF it goes the
power connector and the drive is
submerged it's still transferring no
okay let's get the moisture I think the
power shorted I think that's what
happened here oh oh I don't know what
effect alcohol has on the conformal
coating umm did not think that through
okay so it's been popping kind of in and
out of being detected I think it's to do
with the power connector but quite
honestly see here if we try again now
boom it's transferring it now it's gone
I don't know what we were trying to
prove anyway putting it in water because
it has no real practical application so
let's just go get some mineral oil so I
found all the mineral oil from the
mineral oil PC I sincerely hope and I'm
not going to make a mess here but as you
guys know I'm allergic to funnels so the
chances seem pretty good
here we go soup okay so here we go
can it handle mineral oil I want to see
a longer sustained
transfer here kids that's what I want to
see so you saw it here first folks
liquid cooled hard drive
hopefully my editors have found some way
to turn what's happened in the last half
an hour or so into some kind of coherent
narrative and hopefully you guys enjoyed
it if you aren't familiar with mass drop
they're the community where users
discuss products that they're interested
in buying and then mass drop talks to
the manufacturer and negotiates a bulk
order at a discounted price and they're
now featuring a drop for the high-five
men are easy rho0 IEM they have nine
millimeter dynamic drivers and they ship
with two pairs of silicone ear tips and
they're only about thirty five US
dollars which is pretty sweet so check
them out and other drops at the link in
the video description down below thanks
for watching this video if you disliked
it you know what to do but if you liked
it hit that like button get subscribed
maybe even consider checking out our
merch store where you can buy clothes
shirts like this one or our link to
Amazon where you can buy it stuff like
what we featured in the video like I
don't know maybe this 10 terabyte hard
drive that apparently can run under not
water but non conductive fluid now that
you done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so
check out our video oh excuse me our
video on the desk PC that you see right
here our part 3 the conclusion is up and
ready for your viewing enjoyment</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
