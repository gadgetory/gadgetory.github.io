2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys we now move back
to the VIP section the antec booth to
check out there SP ones many of you will
have known we use SP ones on our editing
rigs sometimes because it has very nice
audio quality but the main complaint
that we have is it's only single channel
they've solved that problem and now you
can pair two SP ones together and then
pair through your phone to one of the SP
ones and then play dual channel through
them very very very cool they also have
it so that if you tap your phone on top
if you have a compatible phone like an
android phone that has an NFC you can
just tap your phone on top and it'll pay
right away very very cool options it's
nice to see dual channel with these you
will have to buy two but it is very nice
to see dual channel with these as we
might use them on a red editing rig
they're very nice and easy to carry
around which is why we use them these
are exceptionally light because they're
empty if you're wondering why I was able
to shake that around then we get to the
one that is exceptionally not light this
one is fully built and it is the sp3 it
is not released yet but it's huge and
brings a much better base option to your
mobile products it has a leather strap
on it currently although that may not
come in the actual production model
because it adds a lot of cost to the
unit comment in the video if you think
this is a good idea then antec can see
that it might actually be a good idea to
have a real leather strap on their
product I personally think it adds a lot
to it I just hope it doesn't add way too
much cost the sp3 is very nice and as a
lot of booming bass to your the
possibility of your mobile products now
we get to SP 0 unfortunately we're
missing the other SP 0 but as you can
see in here you have aux-in and aux out
these are able to be daisy-chained
together so that you can have as many of
them as you actually want my favorite
use case for this is making a gigantic
circle around your room so you can have
that like 360-degree audio style that
they had in the matrix if anyone saw the
creating the matrix video I just brought
the usable audience for that comment
down to like three people which is
awesome but anyways you can link as many
of these as you want together charge
them through micro USB clip a carabiner
on them carry them however you want very
very versatile very very awesome now if
we move to this guy I don't know how
easily i'm going to vary
that was actually surprisingly easy I'd
hit my head on the camera so hopefully
that didn't shake it too much we've got
panasonic batteries Japanese capacitors
and an antec designed PCB in their
battery pack you can tell they're
actually caring about quality one of my
biggest qualms with battery packs is
most people creating them don't care too
much about quality I just want to get
them out as fast as possible very very
nice button it's very very clear easy to
press another qualms that i have about
battery packs is sometimes the buttons
are very annoying and hard to press
looks sharp is just generally sharp
what's still plastic so I'm still not
super hyped about it what I am pretty
super hyped about is these ones which
are absolutely great full aluminum body
all the way around has a very very nice
weight to it and it is the slimmest 9000
milliamp battery that I have ever seen
it has a 2 amp output and a single app
output for a total of three amps out
with an input slot right there very very
sharp actually looks classy which is a
problem that I've had with a lot of
battery packs like I said previously
they don't look very classy if you have
this on your person it might not go very
might not look very sharp if you're in a
professional environment these on the
other hand definitely can thanks for
