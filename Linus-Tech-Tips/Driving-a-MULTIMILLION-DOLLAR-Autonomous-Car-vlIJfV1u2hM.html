present ssvf lemon super excite a possum
all participles casi la poubelle video
mode may hace para well know the famil
group francais sponsor is in at the
unity levira in experience Kiev Remo oh
do come oh my apologies to all the
francophones out there whose language I
just butchered anyway we're on our way
to Normandy right now to see the
symbiotes demo car this is a vehicle
that is so exclusive there is only one
of them in the entire world
so you wouldn't be able to order one but
I wouldn't worry about that because it's
also so high-tech that you wouldn't be
able to afford the multi millions of
euros that it took to develop it anyway
vous voulez levar vet blah Elan Z
okay here it comes and nobody in the
driver's seat Wow
it's beautiful
everything about the design of the
symbiote s demo car was done with a
purpose its dual motor rear-wheel drive
electric powertrain accelerates it from
zero to a hundred kilometers that's 60
miles from my American friends in just
six seconds it's almost completely
smooth with front vertical air intakes
and side wind deflectors to reduce drag
and turbulence for better efficiency and
it's chassis was reimagined from the
ground up for electric power and
autonomous operation so I can just let
go completely
okay nothing because no conversation
about the next decade of automotive
technology can ignore the safety and
convenience advantages of well
implemented driverless technology so the
symbiote demo car is bristling with
sensors in the front and rear bumpers
you'll find Lyde ours with five radars
positioned behind the bodywork and a
belt of twenty ultrasonic sensors all
around the car these rear vision cameras
help track nearby vehicles the door
handles conceal lateral cameras one on
each side two front cameras are
positioned in the upper part of the
windshield with a third wide angle on
the bumper and around back are two more
one on the bumper and one cleverly
concealed and there were no diamond logo
okay ready the vehicle supports three
modes of operations normal or classic a
sporty ER version of that called dynamic
and AD mode when the third one is
activated the exterior lighting turns
blue indicating to the cars around that
it is operating autonomously and the
cars brain capable of level four
autonomy takes over allowing the driver
on authorized roadways to focus his or
her attention entirely on something else
like
I feel like what I'm doing right now
should definitely be illegal while it
handles complicated tasks like
maintaining an appropriate speed and
following distance relative to other
cars merging and exiting highways
changing lanes to overtake other cars
and functioning alone in traffic jams
while all of this is happening the
operator can actually monitor external
sensor data in real-time on three
customisable OLED screens from LG while
basically sitting back and enjoying the
ride the seats can be adjusted for a
little more legroom - a reclined zero-g
mode for chilling out while your car
takes you wherever it is you're going
or even tilted 10 degrees towards the
front seat passenger to converse or even
watch a movie together then taking
things to another level renault has
designed in collaboration with ubisoft
as part of the symbiote demo car the
ability to wear a VR headset piped into
the car's onboard sensors and transport
your driving experience to another
setting altogether this is crazy
now none of this happens without some
significant advances in mobile
connectivity so the symbiote demo car
features relatively obvious things like
an always-on internet connection for
streaming audio or video content
navigation and traffic and calendar
updates from your digital assistant but
there was also some stuff that I didn't
expect
VX - or vehicle to infrastructure
connectivity can display helpful
information like nearby tourist
attractions on the dashboard screen it
can warn the vehicle about any upcoming
hazards like accidents or poor weather
and it can even allow navigation through
toll booths without any intervention
required from the driver whatsoever and
the craziest part about that is that
using RFID tags built into the car it
can actually identify not just the users
in the car but even which seat they're
occupying by their phone
and adjust the seat position music and
climate control to their preferences now
this exact vehicle is not heading to an
assembly line in France anytime soon and
some of its features like the massive
heads-up display
adjustable opacity glass and the smell
emitters that changed the scent of the
cabin depending on the driving mode are
unlikely to make their way to the
mainstream anytime soon but that isn't
really the purpose of the symbiotes demo
car
the reason renault created it was to
show what will be possible tomorrow by
actually building one today
and many of the technologies featured in
this vehicle like the devil a speakers
are expected to make their way into
production vehicles in the coming years
what a freaking time to be alive so
thanks to Renault for sponsoring us out
here the French government for allowing
these tests to take place on public
roads and to you guys for watching if
you thought this video was cool you can
check out Renault on social media for
future updates at at group Renault on
Twitter and at Renault on Instagram and
Facebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
