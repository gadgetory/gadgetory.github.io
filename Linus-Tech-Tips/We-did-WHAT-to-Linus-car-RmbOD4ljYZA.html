I'd love to have a movie night but I
just have too many gosh darn friends I
mean me neither but the point is you can
easily fit five six seven people in a
living room and everyone can see the TV
and be comfortable but what if you've
got 20 friends or 50 friends or a
hundred friends well you're gonna need a
different solution and that is exactly
what we plan to build today
you my friends are about to witness the
world's first Lamborghini that is also a
portable drive-in theater see this right
here it's taking me a while to get it
out of the box but viewsonic sponsored
this madness with their 4k projector
the viewsonic px 747 offers a crispy 4k
uhd resolution that can be used for
viewing 4k content or gaming on screens
up to 25 feet diagonally colors are
vivid thanks to HDR support and it's
very bright at 3500 lumens
that's enough to watch inside during the
day making the PX 747 the brightest
projector under $1500 with up to 15,000
hours of lamp life and an hdcp 2.2
enabled hdmi 1.4 port you can hook it up
to any console or media player you'd
like check out where to buy it at the
link in the video description so step
number one is some kind of a plan for
mounting the projector to the top of the
car then I guess that's the first thing
to talk about cable do you actually want
to do the top of the car oh I I had
thought so because what I was thinking
could look pretty cool yeah is instead
of doing the top of the car to have it
like supercharger style like right here
so is this it we're just gonna like put
it on what are we even gonna project it
at we have a big old screen I'll worry
about that later once we have it on I
just give her take it
okay oh this is a bad time this is hard
for me to even watch here with poor
drill yeah we need to that's good ones
well it's the bit that's slipping I'm
fine okay
okay ah not me well I dropped a I
dropped a nut Oh
I mean are we just leaving this mountain
here like I guess you can take the
projector off temporarily to drive but
like this should this is street legal
right just putting like a bracket on
your car
that go through easy-peasy
all right and it wasn't even that close
to my fingers excellent okay we good me
it yep perfect nice I mean this should
actually seal reasonably well shouldn't
it the rubbers really tight yeah oh oh
yeah there bud so I think this water is
to test the waterproofness of our seal
here they're the lab the bed bed this is
Ray the dad but that's not how it rains
where you're from gentlemen what you're
looking at me like you've never seen
anyone mounting a projector to the front
of his car before this is the mega
screen XL quantity one it weighs 21
pounds and for whatever reason they list
the box size but nowhere on the box or
on the product page for this thing
wherever we bought it does it actually
list the screen size wow that's not bad
actually and it looks pretty much
perfect so we'll just have to make some
angle adjustments but this is about how
far the cars gonna be then okay so all
that's left is to rustle up some friends
to share this experience with us I
really wish I brought my boots because
even though it hasn't rained there's
enough dampness in the grass that my
socks are getting wet not that I'm
saying that my socks are not the most
optimal footwear for these conditions
doesn't their guy scream yeah it's my
god I don't want to play this game
anymore
how the hell align they're not here okay
I'm gonna get a little closer a
viewsonic had no idea what they had in
the store when they sponsored this video
okay that should that should make up the
difference here this might actually look
not bad do you want to get the focus I
just want to know what we're looking at
here
hey it's gonna make some some of them
they're adjustments there oh my god I
thought we were gonna do like a movie
how are we gonna get how are we gonna
get a movie when's it supposed to start
[Laughter]
Brandon really okay we're all on on a
hangout yesterday we're like I told Alex
I was like okay we're now at a suit
maybe 500 people and then I'm like I'm
like now it's probably a hundred and
then Nick's like nah 250 Avon's like 50
well you're wrong too cuz one person did
did he leave you know what screw it I'm
playing video games tonight I don't even
care
oh I want pizza we only gave 24 hours
notice and there's just a balloon at the
end of this driveway
when people are getting lost like up
there even when I came by late that way
that weird party balloon saw Jordan when
a new guy why did we put a balloon there
that doesn't even make any sense but it
was like a really funny balloon right
how would they see it's like in the tall
grass we can play it from this side I'm
here this I've never heard the windows
test telenet allowed
all right I've had enough yeah
how many people did show up 300 for both
it's a good thing it was more than three
otherwise I might have been embarrassed
all right so we're playing first goal
wins and then you got to rotate out so
someone get on deck for each of us I
will be orange no I will be believen I
don't know the buttons for this game
you're doing son all right who's next
let's watch that highlight oh who just
hit the projector Alex you animal yeah I
love that both of the cars are called -
tech tip so I score no matter what I
could trickle in there another only 15
orange
I'm really glad a hundred people didn't
show up that would have been terrible
well whoever's blue actually knows how
to play this game that's cheating call
hacks
yeah go team blue and I didn't even have
to do anything it always blows me away
how good a projector can look when it's
actually legitimately dark so that
pretty much wraps it up massive thanks
to viewsonic for sponsoring this hot
mess massive thanks to the four people
who showed up you guys just like this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
the one that's under all of my layers
right now and our community forum which
you should definitely join oh I need
this back on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
