to suffer from a bit of an identity
crisis gigabyte couldn't figure out how
to brand the thing it carries their
traditional mainstream board ultra
durable branding their g1 gaming
branding and like Black Edition in huge
letters in the middle of a box what the
heck is this thing with its factory
tuning and data center DNA and Intel 730
series SSD is an amazing choice for
gamers and performance enthusiasts
alright so apparently I wasn't tall
enough during the intro and Brandon gave
me another Apple box to stand on on
thanks for that Brandon the answer is
all of the above this is by a
considerable margin gigabytes
highest-end z97 motherboard but before
we get into that let's cover the
accessories shall we in the box you will
find two-way three-way and four-way SLI
bridges yes the board uses a peel X hub
to give it quad crossfire and SLI
support a crossfire bridge an i/o shield
a wireless AC and Bluetooth combo PCIe
card as well as an internal connector
and antenna to go with that six braided
SATA cables half with straight and 1/2
with angled connectors and finally a
three and a half inch front USB module
for your USB 3 in case your case doesn't
have that oh right and I guess there's
also a manual stickers and a driver disk
in there too on the board itself we'll
kick things off with aesthetics where
gigabyte has moved away from the green
color scheme and guns and bullets
branding elements towards a more subdued
black grey and red color scheme that
some will find attractive but others
myself included will find uninspired and
copycat I mean a red and black gaming
motherboard we've never seen that before
but you can hardly blame them for going
with what obviously works right along
with the more subdued practical looks
comes a more subdued practical design
you won't find any extra CPU power
inputs and instead of an over built 300
phase power design it's got a simple yet
robust all-digital
eight phase CPU power design that is
built for longevity rather than bling
notable inclusions are the 10k black
capacitors rated at 10,000 hours at 105
degrees Celsius
the 168 hour testing procedure that each
and every one of these motherboards will
go through before it makes it to your
hands better QC is the kind of thing I
don't mind paying more for especially
given how little there is to
differentiate one motherboard from
another these days the fan on the vrm
heatsink from the z87 equivalent is gone
replaced by beefier passive heat sinks
but liquid cooling is still an option in
gigabyte has actually improved the
flexibility of their solution
significantly by providing G 1/4
threaded holes instead of integrated
Barb's another thumbs up their cpu
support is dictated by the LGA 1150
socket and gigabyte figures you won't
have any difficulty with the last
generation has well chip has well
refresh code name Devil's Canyon chip or
even an upcoming Broadwell processors so
z97 looks like a solid option for
someone planning to build a system now
then upgrade when Intel rolls up their
new CPUs officially we've got dual
channel ddr3 RAM support up to 3200
megahertz but it should be noted that on
Haswell CPUs maximum Ram frequency
decreases as CPU frequency increases
with overclocking so it's not a huge
deal these days in the top right corner
we'll find power reset and clear CMOS
switches along with a debug led and
contact points for reading on board
voltages with a multimeter rather than
relying on software the 24 pin is in its
ideal location along the right-hand edge
of the board with front USB 3 in an on
ciliary SATA connector right beneath it
make sure to plug that in if you're
using more than two graphics cards on
the board
further down things get pretty
interesting gigabyte has added not one
but two additional Marvell controllers
to give this board a total of 10 say two
three six gigabit per second ports and
they've also implemented SATA Express
which will consume two of the regular
Intel SATA 3 ports should you decide to
use that once SSDs that support this new
10 gigabit standard become available at
the bottom we find color coded front
panel connectors and physical switches
to decide which of the two BIOS chips
you want to use as well as whether you
want to use dual BIOS at all although
I'd recommend leaving that on the PCI
Express layout of this board is what I
would consider ideal not everyone likes
this spacing but here's why I like it
you've got lots of space between the 16x
lots here and
here and you can cram four cards on the
board all running in 8x mode if you
really want to by having the bottom card
hang down a little bit and it does this
without increasing the height of the
board to an XL ATX form factor love it
audio has been a big focus for gigabyte
since the beginning of the g1 series and
it continues to be one here they're
using niche akan audio grade capacitors
a gold shielded creative sound processor
and a physically separated PCB in order
to improve performance and reduce
interference they've also thrown in gain
adjustment switches for folks with
difficult to drive headphones a
swappable op-amp socket if you're into
that sort of thing and gold plated
connectors on the back which won't
improve audio quality but might help
with longevity some what now things have
gone really well for the layout of this
board so far but gigabyte bummed up the
fan connectors a little bit in my mind
look at pretty much any water in
performance case and you'll see top
mounted fans or at least mounts for them
gigabyte hasn't got any fan headers on
basically the top half of the board
there here here here here here here and
here which is perfect if your case has
all of the fans in the front and the
bottom a rare occurrence if not a huge
deal and fan extensions are cheap it's
just something that I'd like to see
improved rear i/o is a strong point for
the board ps2 is there for those random
hard to diagnose issues the two USB 2.0
ports are dot ports which supposedly
provide more stable power and are good
for USB sound cards not sure why we need
two of those especially with the
excellent onboard audio but I guess it
saves me the trouble of peering back
there to make sure I'm using the right
one if I'm using a DAC triple displays
running DVI HDMI and DisplayPort are
supported off the onboard graphics and
then we find six USB 3 ports two Gigabit
Ethernet ports one Intel and one killer
e 20 205 Network chip that enables
packet prioritization for your most
important applications this is a layout
that I really like giving me the option
of Intel or the killer one and then
finally gold-plated 7.1 audio ports as
well as an optical audio port for good
measure speaking of good measure I hope
this video gave you a pretty good
measure of the awkwardly named 2
gigabyte z97 X gaming g1 Wi-Fi BK Black
Edition ubered clock I don't know
whatever anyway it includes everything
the kitchen sink hardware-wise and even
adds an updated ez UF UEFI bios mode as
well as a self-tuning overclocking
feature within gigabytes ez tune
software but more importantly it adds
more testing and validation so you're
unlikely to end up with a lemon this is
the kind of thing I really value these
days and it's great to see gigabyte
raising the bar this way thanks for
