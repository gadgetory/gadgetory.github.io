visit www.samhsa.gov/dtac 650 TI boost
edition so it's got its got GPU boost
which the old one didn't it's got more
ram which the old one didn't it's got a
wider memory bus which still one that I
didn't want even calling this thing 650
TI this is actually a major step up in
terms of performance and the actual link
technology that's inside it compared to
the 650 Ti and it addresses a very
interesting spot in the markets you can
see it comes packed in some anti-static
foam and video wants the cards they send
to reviewers to arrive in one piece it
also comes in an anti-static bubble wrap
which we're going to go ahead and open
up which is then inside an anti-static
bag so yes it arrived safely looking
good and hopefully when we throw this on
the test bench for our review it's going
to function great and I'm sure well so
the first thing we see about the card is
that it has in videos sort of signature
Kepler shroud it looks really sharp
looks really good but is actually not
that I mean compared to something like
the 690 or the Titan cooler it is not as
expensive to make so you can see where
there would have been a polycarbonate
window to see the fins underneath and
where there would have been a glowing
logo they've replaced that with a
plastic textured pattern and then a
green GeForce GTX on the top it still
looks sharp but obviously this is this
is slightly less expensive they've got
their exhaust fan so it's a blower style
fan on the back this doesn't keep the
GPU itself as cool as some of the dual
fan designs that you're going to see
from board partners but what it does do
is it takes all the air from inside your
case and pushes it out the back so this
is great for small form-factor systems
or in systems where optimal ventilation
is not necessarily available to you
don't want to add a bunch of fans so for
quiet computing this is often a bed
design its a PCI Express 3.0 card so
here on the bottom of the card you see
it's a 16 X card this is pretty much par
for the course and unlike the 650 Ti it
does have support for SLI which makes
sense because I've said this a lot of
times but for low-end cards it usually
makes more sense to buy a single better
card versus buying two of them so NVIDIA
has gone ahead and they have segmented
their graphics card and they've gone
okay look we're only going to put SLI on
the cards where it may actually make
sense to buy two of these cards and run
them in SLI the other thing that makes
this card make more sense to run in SLI
is the fact that it has a 192 bit bus at
least that's what my notes say anyway we
can yeah there we go 192 bit bus with
two gigs of memory so if you were to run
to one gig cards in SLI number one is
you might get some more performance of
the GPU but you're not actually going to
be able to crank up your resolution
because you're going to be limited
remember two cards running an SLI each
with a Giga memory gives you a total of
one gig of usable memory for the entire
graphics subsystem so good giving this
card two gigs of memory makes it
suitable for modern games at 1080p I'd
say one gig is not quite enough in this
contrasts with AMD's recent launch of
the 77 90 having only one gig of memory
I'd say in this price class although
this one is a little bit higher you got
to have two gigs it comes in under the
price of the 78 50 which given the
performance numbers that I am led to
believe I'm going to see but haven't
tested yet should make it very very
competitive last thing that they oh yeah
very low very low power only a single 6
pin connector the back you can see the
PCB is actually quite short like some of
the other geforce cards we've seen and
they've gone with their ego extension on
the back of a card to make it look more
like a you know like a more
high-performance graphics card honestly
the PCB length does not affect the
performance of the graphics card and if
you don't like the reference design
there will be plenty of cards available
from guys like Asus MSI gigabyte that
are using a longer PCB with a larger
cooler the last thing that I'm really
excited to see on this card is the fact
that it has four outputs natively on
some of the lower end Kepler cards
before we were seeing only three outputs
which means you can't support three
monitors and surround plus an auxilary
display
natively on the card without well you
can't support it on the card unless the
board partners implement the extra
connectors on their own love to see this
on the reference design because while
this card even though it's got two gigs
of RAM is probably not suitable for
three by 1080p surround gaming and
modern titles it's nice to have that
available as a Productivity thing for
guys who are like oh well I want to get
a decent card that I can run a nice
multi-monitor setup on and I can also
game on on a single monitor when I'm not
working so clock speed wise GPU boost
not only does it come with a higher base
clock so it's at nine hundred and 80
megahertz versus nine twenty five on the
older cheaper card although I believe
that card stays current so I can't
necessarily call it older but the
previously released card it also boosts
all the way up to a typical blue boost
clock of ten thirty three so this is at
least ten percent faster when it's
running in boost mode versus that older
card that's really cool
Plus that 192 bit bus and the extra
memory gives you a ton more performance
and we're really really excited to check
it out it also has six gigahertz gddr5
memory and I think that pretty much
wraps it up 768 cuda cores just like the
old one it is running the same GK 106
GPU and without further ado thank you
for watching this unboxing on Linus tech
tips don't forget to like the video
subscribe and I don't know what else can
I tell you guys to do go eat a banana
and and do let's see go eat a banana and
then take the last bit of the banana
find a close relative of yours walk up
take the piece of banana and smush it
onto their chest and see what they say
guys leave a comment under the video
with what your relative said when you
did that and that is it for the worst
advice I've ever given in a video ever</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
