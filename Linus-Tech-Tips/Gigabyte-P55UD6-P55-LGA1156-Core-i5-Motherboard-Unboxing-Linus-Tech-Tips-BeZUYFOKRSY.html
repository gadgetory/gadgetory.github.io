from gigabyte this is their
top-of-the-line p55 motherboard you can
see it features 24 phase power along
with all of their other technologies SLI
crossfire Dolby home theater and ultra
durable 3 it comes in a really high-end
box as you can see so you can see a
preview of the board but don't worry
we'll will unbox the whole thing here
before the end of this now we're
shooting our video today in Southeast
Asia where this board was designed and
manufactured as you can see from the map
below us lossy outer sleeve and then we
get down to the actual box that the
motherboard comes in I hope ok there we
go so let's do the accessories first and
have a look at what comes with gigabytes
premium p55 product so we have our our
user guide for smart trusted platform
module then we have our smart 6 user
manual we have our normal motherboard
user manual along with our driver and
utility DVD then we have the
multilingual installation guidebook
which is more of a QuickStart guide and
then in terms of actual components we've
got four SATA cables and an IDE cable
then we have an SLI a floppy SLI bridge
then we have what appears to be an eSATA
you let me just double check SATA to
eSATA cable it looks like oh no these
are just black yes SATA to eSATA cables
2 of them and then we have an eSATA
bracket that gives you two eSATA ports
just by plugging in two internal SATA
ports and then
to molex to SATA power adapter so you
could just plug in regular regular
drives outside of your computer if you
wanted to do that without an enclosure
so there's our little sticker gigabyte
powered sticker and then here is the i/o
shield okay so let's get down to the
motherboard itself get this baby on back
here so you can see that the puppy
oh it's taped it's taped shut okay I
hadn't noticed that that would have been
kind of embarrassing there we go so you
can see that compared to gigabytes
normal p55 boards there are a lot of
power faces on this motherboard and I
cannot get it out of the plastic
packaging here somehow it is it is in
the board and not allowing me to remove
it okay so there's your 24 phase power
how do you like that that is a lot of
power phases and you can actually see a
lot of the power circuitry is on the
back of the motherboard so they've
they've overloaded the amount of space
they actually have to provide power to
the CPU you have quite a robust cooling
solution running from your Southbridge
area to the to the chipset up to the
mosfet cooling and what you'll notice
about this board is unlike other p55
boards it actually has six RAM slots now
it still only works in dual Channel but
you can actually load up an additional
two modules even though you won't get
additional performance you can have a
little bit of extra capacity now like
all of the other p55 high-end boards you
do have support for SLI and crossfire at
8 X 8 X electrical you've got use of six
of your seven expansion slots I don't
know what you'll be able to plug in here
with this Northbridge in the way now
you've got onboard let's see what is
this this is an onboard see most clear
switch and then you have an onboard
power switch up on the top right of the
board your power connectors are up at
the top left for the eight pin and then
over on the right-hand edge for the 24
pin right where they belong and in terms
of connectivity you've got 10
say to port so you can see those from
the side and then you have one IDE port
here now let's have a look at the back
panel IO and again you can see this is a
fully loaded board so you've got 10 USB
ports 2 eSATA ports so these are both
those USB eSATA combo ports you have a
ps2 keyboard mouse combo port you've got
digital audio two Gigabit Ethernet ports
and then 7.1 channel audio so thank you
for checking out my blog on the gigabyte
p55 at you d6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
