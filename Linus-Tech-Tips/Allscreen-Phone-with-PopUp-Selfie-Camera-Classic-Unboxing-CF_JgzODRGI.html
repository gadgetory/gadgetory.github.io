the weekends but when I do I'm always
bound to end up working on a video kids
are being kind of loud okay let's take
this outside so this thing just arrived
at the office I'm actually supposed to
be going camping today but I'm gonna
have to see I've got all my camping
supplies that maybe I can actually maybe
I can use here to somehow facilitate
this video ah yes here we go
so I was packing to head over to the
campsite when yeah that seems when
someone message me from the office to
let me know that the vivo next just
arrived complete with its product review
guide which basically has all the
information that I have about this phone
because I haven't really been following
it other than that I know that this is
the fully bezel list phone that vivo has
been working on slash teased over the
last little while and another thing that
I know is from having talked to at least
one other phone manufacturer the
original idea behind this was that it
was only going to be a concept at least
that was their understanding of it but
then vivo turned around and actually
produced the thing so I mean yeah
initial impressions here this is nice
this is something that I've seen more
with the Chinese brands than with the
Western ones it actually comes with a
like a thin plastic body protector so
you can take that off if you want but it
doesn't appear to be designed such that
you're you have to take it off so you
can leave that on there until you know
dbrand decides whether or not they're
gonna support it with a skin or whatever
the case may be at the top we've got a
headphone jack that's nice to see I'm
surprised they managed to do a full body
and a headphone jack and then this right
here is the
little trapdoor that hides the selfie
camera because when the entire front of
the phone is an uninterrupted display
there's no room to put like a camera or
face ID sensor or anything like that
and this is really impressive okay so
this button let's hold on let's just go
ahead and unlock it oh wow they sent the
they sent the review samples like kind
of pre setup I guess we're taking these
back I'm not sure so we've got an AI
button over here but that doesn't seem
to do anything at the moment spec wise
right that's notable so this is using
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor it's
got 8 gigs of RAM this particular one
has 256 gigs of ROM so this is basically
completely maxed out in every way but
the the notable thing here is it's using
the AI engine version of the snapdragon
845 so I haven't actually seen a phone
that's using this variant of that
particular processor yet so one of the
things that phone manufacturers are
really pushing when they've got this AI
tech built into their chip so this is
true of honor' with their Chiron
processors and who was it oh right
I think it was honored to with the honor
10 where they were using an AI version
of a 600 series Snapdragon don't quote
me on that one but what they're mostly
using it for is battery life
optimization so maybe we can find some
settings in here not actually that
familiar with vivos power consumption
ranking interesting okay that's kind of
neat I'm not that familiar with vivos
android skin and then the other thing is
in the camera so this is cool something
we're seeing more and more of so oneplus
supports this on the 1 + 6 I've seen it
on another phone that I can't talk about
yet and then I'm also seeing it here but
I actually kind of like vivos approach
so gesture based navigation it's on the
iPhone 10 as well obviously for your
back button you just swipe up the one
side
I'm sorry I have no idea for home you
swipe up the middle and then again just
like the iPhone 10 you swipe up and hold
if you want to get to the multitask
interface but what I like here is that
they've gone and they've put these three
subtle lines here so that there's no
confusion about it but you still get
pretty much the full screen experience
all right
now I brought a bunch of phones out can
you see okay I can even see what's on
the screen okay cool
so add actually drove to my house to
help me shoot this so I brought a bunch
of phones out we've got the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 which I'd say is sort of the
last of the very thin bezel but not
entirely bezel is phones at this point
now that we've seen the industry trend
going the way that it is I've got a
pixel to excel which I apparently didn't
boot up before we started yeah yeah the
bootloader is unlocked I know whatever
and then just for lulz I've got this
budget phone that I'm actually working
on a review of so this is the Alcatel 3v
and what's interesting to me about this
one is that it actually has not that far
off of a screen to body ratio compared
to something like a pixel to Excel so
even the budget phones are really making
off a lot of ground compared to what
would have been a flagship premium
device like what six months ago
it's actually amazing I was having lunch
with Luke yesterday and he pulled out
his pixel XL his pixel one XL and he put
it up to me to show me something and I
thought that he was showing me a
screenshot because it looked like sort
of the screen of a phone within a frame
and it took me about three heartbeats to
realize that no phones just had bezels
like that so it's one of those funny
things like upgrading to an SSD where
you don't necessarily put in an SSD and
go wow my computer sure faster but then
you take it away and you go wow how did
I ever live with this okay it's a little
less extreme than an SSD but it is one
of those things that you definitely
notice after the fact so alright pixel
to XL not exceptional galaxy s 9 yeah
sure here why don't we come over here
can you see it a little better
alright let's go ahead and bring up a
browser so that we've got something
that's a little bit higher contrast so
galaxy s 9 with the edge to edge to edge
display does a pretty darn good job now
let's go ahead and pull up the new vivo
phone for comparison here it is it's
really heavy wow that is pretty
incredible so one of the little tricks
that they've used as you can see how
small the chin bar is that was something
that again my understanding was that we
weren't gonna see on an on Apple device
for a while so what Apple did in order
to get the chin bar of the iPhone 10 so
small was they actually folded some of
the electronics that are tied into the
screen under it using a flexible OLED
display so you can see here that oh and
I'm totally gonna drop one of these if I
keep this up there we go
so you can see here that Apple still has
the skinniest bottom bezel compared to
the s9 and even to this full screen one
so actually it no yeah okay thank you so
actually it looks like no apples patent
still has a patent or it might not be a
patent it might just be an exclusivity
deal on the completely like folding
underneath electronics hasn't run out
yet but other manufacturers are getting
pretty darn close I guess that's why
we've got a slightly bigger chin on it
than the other bezels the other ones are
all pretty much equal though now I'm
probably gonna follow this up with a
full review actually you guys can let me
know if you want to see that or if
you're just like actually you know what
I don't care who cares about vivo then I
guess you can feel free to leave a
comment with that too but one thing I do
want to do before I end this sort of one
take classic unboxing is I do want to
take a couple pictures just to see where
we're at here iPhone 10 is probably a
good point of comparison these are such
good conditions it's an overcast day
that it's not really it's not really
going to be that challenging for either
of them you can see there's a fair bit
of like fisheye effect in the lens
there's more distortion and I wouldn't
thoroughly expect even on a cellphone
camera so here there's some but apples
either correcting for it or they've got
a slightly less wide-angle lens looks
like it is yeah it is actually a touch
less wide that's why we're getting a
little bit of that fisheye effect also
colors look pretty warm ah yeah sure or
whatever try making your photos
beautiful what are you saying ouch
oh ah
wow that is actually okay now obviously
I'm not looking at it side by side next
to anything else but nope yeah I am NOT
impressed with the amount of detail on
that front shooter so far alright
whoever's calling me not right now but
look at that I mean it is like it is
like just holding a window into
something like to a so much greater
degree than the s9 that I'm pretty blown
away right now
like do you remember those digital
picture frames that they would sell at
the Best Buy and you know they were like
45 bucks or whatever and you were just
like yeah this is kind of a cool concept
except that they're like 60% bezel and
then they've got like this little tiny
screen in the middle of them this is
like the opposite experience of that
that is unreal here I'll get I'll get
you in the shade so you can like so you
can actually see can you see better now
it's green turned Hub that's crazy
hey man like particularly for something
like playing games watching movies
actually that's a good idea why don't we
just fire up a Chinese phone and willing
to bet it doesn't even come with YouTube
of course not no play store no YouTube
that's what I get for just you know
starting it but fortunately I've got
Baidu and 10 cent and Taobao
so okay that might have to wait for the
full review I guess I'm probably going
to have to do that but then the next
thing I want to do is I want to see that
selfie camera
look at it go oh wow
hey that's actually far from the worst
selfie camera I've actually seen I mean
yeah it doesn't look great but that's a
very tough is there a sound effect okay
now hold on there is are you can you
hear that
sounds like like a space-age like
friggin I don't think that's entirely
actually the the motor noise but it's
pretty that's pretty cool I also you
make it go down just by like going
somewhere else so if we look back at
this picture give it a second there it
goes that is pretty cool now I mean I
have my doubts about the durability of a
mechanism like this but I will say to
vivos credit it's pretty nice that
they've managed to integrate the rear
camera into the regular rear of the
phone and that they don't have a little
thing that pops up for that because I
mean personally I use that a lot more
than I use the front one and so my
concern about it immediately braking is
significantly reduced the other big cool
piece of tech in this phone is it's got
a built in in screen fingerprint reader
so I'm actually going to turn the
display off so we can try and get a look
at where it is on the x21 if you looked
at it just right you were kind of able
to find it but it actually looks like
they've improved it yet again they're
iterating really fast on these and I
can't see it at all now that's
incredible screen yeah yeah it's on
screen so here we'll just set one up
hold on a second oh I don't know if it
has bla-bla-bla input methods needs to
connect to the internet okay that's okay
if you guys have seen the x21 video
you've seen how it works
but uh yeah no I cannot see it at all so
I think that's pretty much it it's heavy
really heavy the screen looks absolutely
incredible initial impressions of the
camera are not great but there's plenty
of time for me to you know try it under
different conditions and have it really
impressed me and I don't know anything
about pricing yet so stay tuned for the
full review of the vivo NEX subscribe do
i do I do an outro with these classic
unboxings I don't know I just cut it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
