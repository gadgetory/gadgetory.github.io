together a budget eight core gaming PC
for under a hundred and fifty bucks for
the CPU RAM and motherboard that is
still a great deal almost two years
later and we were able to do this thanks
to a couple of things one high-end
workstation and server equipment is
often ahead of the technology curve in
certain ways like multi-core processors
and to the way that businesses upgrade
their IT gear on a regular cycle can
lead to big jumps in the supply of this
older tack on sites like eBay where the
pricing often ends up much lower than
mainstream hardware because it's less
familiar to the average consumer and
nobody's searching for it
so we thought to ourselves well now
eight core CPUs are like mainstream so
how do we take this concept to another
level let's build the most badass
machine possible using decommissioned
server gear what could go wrong
nothing could go wrong by visiting our
merch store which has shirts hats and
more it even has stickers there's a link
below so this video has actually been
ongoing since the mid May I mean what
the crap how difficult could it be to
source some junky old stuff on eBay and
slap it together it's story time so way
back then Anthony and I was like way
early on in his employment here even we
sat down and we first looked for the
biggest baddest motherboard we could
possibly find on eBay the most sockets
the most memory slots that the most
actual physical size and we settled on
this the super mikro h 8q g 6f designed
for the proprietary SW TX form factor
and checked all the boxes for g3 for CPU
sockets 32 DIMM slots for up to a
terabyte of ECC registered ddr3 memory
multiple PCI Express slots and even an
on board
LSI SAS controller this thing isn't
another league look at all those
connectors and yes those are fans on the
chipsets plural chipsets speaking of
which the i/o includes three Ethernet
port so two gigabit for data and another
one for IP mi which is a remote
management interface you can learn more
about here next up then choosing a CPU
or rather four of them as we pointed out
in our hundred and fifty dollar gaming
rig video top of the line SKUs for even
very old servers are still being sold at
a premium but drop down a few tears and
ah there we go
the Opteron 62 76 with 16 cores each can
be had for 30 bucks
so we snatched up four of those then we
grabbed a case lot of 16 for gig sticks
of ECC registered memory giving us
quad-channel memory for each of our 4c
that's like 16 channels of memories
hahahahaha so then at this point we were
ready to rip up the performance charts
right not really
so not only is this motherboard a crazy
form factor that wouldn't even begin to
fit in any case or test bench we have
here at the office we also needed to
track down a power supply with three EPS
12 volt connectors in order to supply
power to all of these bloody CPUs I mean
even the highest end consumer units only
come with two such cables at most so
what we ended up doing was
frankensteining together the cables from
two modular units onto one success so
then with that as you solved we plugged
it all in and powered it up thanks green
the board wasn't posting now the CPUs
are on the supported list so what gives
well we ended up shelving it and waiting
a couple of months for a slightly
stripped down version of the same board
it lacks the SAS controller and a few
PCIe slots so that's a bummer but it'll
do at least it came with some eight core
Opteron 6128 already installed so we
were able to use those to fire it up
verify it was working then swap our 16
cores in and what okay
I'm gonna skip the long version here and
it turns out that despite the BIOS
reporting that it was the latest
revision it was not so a desperation
BIOS flash later and we were finally in
business on an unrelated note anyone
want to buy an unexpectedly functional
quad socket Opteron board anyone Bueller
Bueller Bueller oh right no you want to
see how it performs first huh
well with a whopping 64 cores we put it
straight head-to-head with rise and
thread Ripper and Intel's latest core i9
we this thing's gonna win with its eyes
closed and one hand bind it's back in
the multi-threaded tests right we'll get
to those but first let's address the
elephant in the video title
Gaming it sucks Mike let me make this
abundantly clear this is a 1080 TI
running at 1080p so if you've ever
wondered what a bottleneck looks like
this is it
rise of the Tomb Raider in DirectX 12
got 10% of the performance of the core
i7 7700 get 10% and it's even worse in
csgo I mean at least it was only half as
bad in 3d marking Unigine super position
but I mean if Super Micro is to be
believed this is or at least was a
machine that was designed to do work not
games so will it blend actually yeah
in blender its 3d rendering prowess
doesn't put it quite on the level of
thread Ripper work for i9 but it handily
out does the Rison 7 1800 x4 roughly the
same overall system cost unsurprisingly
Cinebench and 7-zip show similar results
but the lack of a VX to support and
relatively low cache per core hinders
its high core count significantly
compared to its more modern competition
even in these multi-threaded workloads
and there's more to buying a CPU than
just performance 2 so we tested our
thermals with some Noctua nff 12s just
sitting on top of the heap thinks that
we're included with our board and
actually this wasn't bad each CPU hit
only 55 degrees at the worst in i-264
as for that power draw hone le wow
that's a number that only gets trumped
by our overclocked 18 core core I 979
ATX e extreme edition though in fairness
this is 64 cores across four CPUs so
bottom line then umm fun experiment but
did we get our money's worth well given
that we bought two boards by accident no
no we didn't but let's play a game where
we pretend we didn't do that for gaming
this setup is super dumb but for
productivity
surely doesn't look that bad even though
it is at the bottom of our charts like
so all in we paid about eighteen hundred
and eighty eight dollars for this ghetto
workstation as SPECT using a motherboard
box as an open bench style case now as
soon as you buy modern hardware like a
1080 Ti the bottlenecking
of that high end gear hurts your overall
system value but if all you wanted was
CPU performance and you just put like a
five dollar graphics card in then our
system here actually delivers better
value than Rison thread Ripper and if we
had waited our testing more towards
blender we'd have seen an even better
price to performance ratio this actually
makes for a be a really cool budget
blender box but if you want to do almost
literally anything else with your
machine especially gaming it shouldn't
be your first choice especially given
the headache factor speaking of
headaches do you find yourself with a
headache at the end of the day as a
freelancer or small business owner while
FreshBooks has got you taken care of
it's the small business accounting
software that is custom-built for how
you want to work it's a way to be more
productive more organized and perhaps
most importantly get paid faster you can
create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds you can
set up online payments with just a
couple clicks and you can see when your
client has seen your invoice putting an
end to the guessing games for an

guys if you dislike this video you can
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description or maybe something sensible
maybe we'll put like a thread ripper
down there or something also down there
we have our merch store which has cool
