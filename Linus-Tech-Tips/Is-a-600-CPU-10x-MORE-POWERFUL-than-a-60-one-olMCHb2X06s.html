$64 earlier this year i thought gee the
core i7 6850 is almost exactly 10 times
the price we should see if it's at all
worth it but we kind of missed the boat
on that one because the core i9 is here
now so I mean who we even care about
this comparison anymore anyway
wait we'll just use its replacement the
core I 978 20x and we'll just agree to
disagree about how many times 64 goes
into 600
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description let's get this out
of the way right now we are not
expecting the pen TMG 4560 to go
toe-to-toe with the kora 978 20x that's
stupid
I mean for one the core I 9 has turbo
boost to say nothing of the six extra
course that it's packing under the hood
well ok Linus then what is the point of
this video I'm glad you asked first
since one is roughly 10 times the cost
of the other
we thought this would give us a good
feel for how pricing scales with
performance within intel's product stack
because i think obviously we're not
gonna be getting ten times the
performance with the car I know hey will
be no we've been through that that's
stupid
reason number two is that this will give
us some interesting insight into
bottlenecks and where they show up
within the system for example will the
rebalanced cash and avx-512 support of
the core i9 help it will it hinder it
will it depend on the workload how much
will the extra cores help with
real-world tasks does it even really
matter now I know I know raw performance
isn't the whole story the core I 9 has
more than double the PCI Express Lanes
quad-channel memory support blob and
those features don't come cheap
so it makes sense that you'd be paying a
premium for both the CPU and the
accompanying motherboard and because the
core i 9 demands a better cooling
solution surprise you get to buy one of
those two they even require more thermal
compound thanks to their larger physical
size I mean the Pentium comes with a
cooler and compound that's more than
adequate for it
right out of the box
so then with all these differences how
can we possibly compare the two easy
we'll just dump a bunch of benchmarks
into Excel like we always do and wait
really it's not all I'm paying these
guys for oh no there's more here
actually oh cool okay so while we'll be
running the two chips on otherwise
identical hardware we are also going to
run a second set of tests on the 7820 x
with it configured with only two cores
enabled and clocked like a G 4560 so in
the past this method of cutting down
higher-end chips has generated pretty
accurate simulations of lower end ones
but today the new cache setup in support
for avx-512 might make things a little
more interesting our gaming results well
okay these ones aren't gonna shock
anybody our simulated 4560 does slightly
better than the real thing and the stock
78 20x blows the doors off of both in
every test but while that difference is
measurable our arch nemesis dr. point of
diminishing returns makes a bold
appearance here interestingly our
simulated chip actually fell slightly
but measurably short of the real one at
4k and csgo and in 3d mark which makes
us wonder where else we might see
Intel's new caching mechanism perform
worse bottom line here if you thought
that spending 10 times was gonna net you
10 times the performance in gaming ah I
believe as the gamers say get rekt
productivity though was really
interesting in applications like why
cruncher that support avx-512 we saw a
massive difference with the simulated
g40 560 while in more traditional tasks
like Cinebench cpu mark and real bench
the cache related performance boost is
less exciting with real benches and
coding tests revealing another situation
where it may actually cause a slight
performance regression it's not over for
the simulated chip though because our
real-world blender test also sees a huge
performance boost
over the real 4560 in productivity
applications the lack of a DX and course
hurts
our value chip big-time the 7820 ax
still doesn't give you ten times the
performance for its price but given that
many of these workloads are business
oriented ones time is money and even a
2x performance improvement or a more
modest one could allow it to pay for
itself over time so your mileage may
vary power consumption is probably not
gonna surprise anybody some will skim
through that but what might is the
performance scaling using some simple
math helpfully provided by Alex we
crunched the numbers and calculated a
very theoretical ballpark for how
pricing would look if it's scaled
linearly with performance so in that
world
from the perspective of bokura 978 20x
the performance averaged price of the
Pentium would actually be roughly five
times as expensive as it is today then
looking at it the other way around the
price of the core I 978 20x would work
out to about a quarter of its current
MSRP of $600 so what did we learn today
well first and foremost that CPU pricing
at least for Team Blue is more
complicated than just how does it
benchmark on a test bench and then you
know what price tag should we slap on it
and more importantly perhaps we've also
confirmed that skylake X's new cache
generally helps more than it hinders
though it can hinder situationally there
are a hundred reasons for wanting
multiple computers at your desk maybe
you're a Mac person primarily but you
need a non virtualized Windows
environment for some reason synergy
solves the problem of having to have two
keyboards and two mice for two or more
separate computers you can share one set
of peripheral so you'll no longer get
confused and the whole thing is seamless
you just drag the mouse from one screen
to another we're talking peace
Mack and even Linux support they offer a
basic and pro option for synergy with a
one-time payment and features include
advanced stuff like clipboard sharing
between computers dragging and dropping
files between computers the ability to
set up hotkeys and more so use our link
in the video description to get 50% off
synergy today so thanks for watching
guys that this video sucked you know
what to do but if it's awesome get
subscribed hit that like button or check
out the link to where the buy the stuff
we featured in the video description
also down there is our merch store with
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join so you can talk shop with other
tech enthusiasts from around the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
