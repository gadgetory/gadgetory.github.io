are here but perhaps more importantly my
email from Asus giving me the guidance
that I need to overclock the 56 core
system is also here so what do we stand
to gain according to a sis's guidance
anywhere from three to nine percent
performance and what do we stand to lose
$20,000 in CPUs 750 dollars and
motherboards and about five grand worth
of RAM so what are we waiting for
anchors new power wave 7.5 pad and stand
both offer faster wireless charging easy
alignment for your device and the pad is
coated with an anti-slip material check
them out on Amazon through the links
below
so one of the most exciting things about
this board to me other than the
hilariously broken webpage for it with
this placeholder text today is the fact
that a soos advertises it as
overclocking capable so this is the
exact same platform that we had set up
from our holy so we've got a system
that seems to be locked up and we're
back everything seems to be working fine
256 processing cores and completely
inadequate cooling so we're getting some
baseline readings here so we're sitting
at around sixty seven hundred and
Cinebench let's go ahead and restart it
and key in what asus figures is gonna
give us a three percent overclock and
then we're gonna go from there so we go
into AI overclock tuner set that to
manual change this to 103
spread-spectrum gets disabled xeon
turbocharger gets enabled and then wow
that's not good oh that's not good at
all well that didn't work just gonna
fire them over a quick email saying
thank you for the instructions by the
way they were this is one of the
challenges with overclocking by base
clock rather than by adjusting the
multiplier when you adjust the base
clock you actually throw a bunch of
other system frequencies out of whack
including PCI Express and what can
happen is if you go too far out of spec
you can make it so that certain devices
won't be detected anymore I've never
heard of 1% out of spec causing a
storage controller to stop showing up
but our SATA drive is not showing up at
a hundred and one base clock I hope it
didn't break the drive yeah see there's
no there's no dry food options here okay
we're gonna go back to 100 and see if
this shows up again bear its back see
ata device so that's a good sign you
know you could get absolutely like
shredded if like every time you had to
wait around
for a server board to post you're just
like yeah I'm just that seems like a lot
of work no okay here's what we're gonna
do is we're gonna switch over to an MDOT
to nvme SSD because we know our video
card was still working so some stuff
still might work okay this is good
so our 960 pros here let's go ahead and
save our changes and see if at 101 we
can boot up into Windows nice okay check
this out this is good
a hundred and one megahertz seventy-five
94 wait is that much higher Oh looks
like just some of the things we've tuned
are even without any base clock
overclocking forcing the processor to
run at a higher turbo frequency let's
see if we can push for more so this is
it the turbo ratio lock this right here
is sort of similar to the multi-core
optimization that caused that whole
scandal during the coffee lake launch so
it was effectively causing higher power
consumption but our performance
overclocking the processors out of the
box now that it's not enabled by default
I don't think there's any scandal there
but that's why we got so much more
performance it was taking the expected
turbo for all cores active and just
setting it to like a higher turbo that
was for not all the cores being active
with that said according to a sis's
guidance we should expect more than one
percent on top of that so we're trying
three percent what the reset button
stopped working I didn't even touch it
there I don't know if this is a good
sign yet it's doing this thing where it
like keeps trying and it makes a little
bit further every time but then it keeps
just resetting itself this Ram is
already running it like the
balls-to-the-wall speed for this
platform 2600 maybe we dial that back
and
if maybe trying to not run the memory
out of spec will help us get booted up
at 103 and I would have thought it
possible but I made it worse postcode
zero I got an email from a soos
different contact this time jackeline
who suggested I try her exact
configuration but we're gonna need to
make a couple of changes first of all no
SATA Drive that's got to go second of
all I've got to rip out most of the RAM
and she also suggested that I try with
the onboard graphics wow these are hot
my computer in oh come on the only thing
worse than slow posting server boards is
when slow posting server boards post and
then reset themselves as part of like it
I don't know if this is a memory
training exercise or somehow no one is
doing it just turn off again so now from
a second source
yeah no problem all I did was dial in
these settings and bippity Boppity well
well now I'm in even worse position
overclocking failed and I have no
keyboard detected yes I have another
idea we're gonna give it more voltage
and we're straight to zero zero so I've
got a couple more ideas there are a few
other things here that maybe we could
look at we could turn on load line
calibration stop it good some help it's
time for a Hail Mary to be clear I don't
think this is thermals related but let's
water cool this thing see what happens
this brand new nope
and whoever put it back didn't put the
hardware back with it thank you guys wow
this was left over from whole room water
cooling Oh gross to be clear the rust
isn't from the pump itself these don't
these don't rust the worst part is I
know everything I'm doing right now is
almost definitely for nothing okay come
on now - scissors cut my life into
pieces and you know what we're gonna go
full Hail Mary let's just put all the
RAM back in this is an advanced water
cooling technique this is known as the
the pump and fill look at this mess I
better get some good results out of it
okay CPUs are still detective all the
RAM is still detectives the bad news is
on first boot we got an overclocking
failed message so that's flippin Wow
those are much better CPU temps 30 and
36 so we have dropped just about 30
degrees about 25 degrees off of our CPUs
we're going full ham on the CPU voltage
let's hit it
hey 103 it might have been the auto
voltage not going high enough the whole
time
holy let's head it with a load we're
back to the same score we got before we
just tuned those BIOS settings and ran
it at 101
okay let's try restoring our defaults
and keying everything in manually again
okay here we go we're at 3.3 gigahertz
this time 75 96 okay even if we could
get another 4% we wouldn't be able to
crack 8,000 but definitely we have to
try
I mean it's funny like we preached the
importance of cooling all the time
around here but I've never seen it have
this profound an impact and straight to
postcode zero zero okay maybe I
shouldn't have changed so many things at
once
so without tooling around with any of
that other stuff this time let's go for
105 again come on baby
come on baby zero zero all right you can
overclock a workstation or a server but
you're gonna affect your system in ways
that you might not otherwise foresee
like making it so your SATA SSD doesn't
show up and the performance games are
probably fairly negligible my
recommendation based on the performance
we were able to achieve is just go with
some kind of like turbo manipulation
like a Seuss's turbo locking thing and
if that's stable call it a day
rip rip the dream new from mass drop is
a new keyboard modeled after the super
successful K type it's fully
programmable with RGB lighting and qmk
firmware which makes it much easier to
program and gives you more control at
checkout you can choose between Cherry
MX chi-wah and halo switches which will
affect the pricing depending on your
choice and there are a few first
production perks that you get if you
join this drop now including a free
novelty key cap behind-the-scenes live
Q&amp;amp;A with the designer and ten bucks free
for your next key cap set so pick it up
today on mass drop for a limited time
