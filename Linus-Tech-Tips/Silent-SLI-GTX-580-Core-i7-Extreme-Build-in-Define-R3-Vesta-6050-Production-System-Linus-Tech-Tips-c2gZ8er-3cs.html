the NCIX PC lab now we did our Vesta
6050 which the prototype of which you
can see right here we showed it running
games we showed it being sort of
designed okay so that's all fine and
cool but we had a customer come to us
and this is one of the first 60 50
series systems off of our production
line he came to us and he said well I
want the Vesta 60 50 I like the overall
spec I want to make a couple small
tweaks but I don't want such a big case
I have some space considerations for
where I'm putting my computer and we
kind of went okay well what we'll do is
we'll we'll see what we can do to
customize the 60 50 into the smaller
define our three chassis versus the
larger define XL chassis so we made a
couple tweaks first of all the mod you
vent feature here we've taken off the
sound dampening material and replaced it
with a 140 millimeter exhaust fan so we
do have some slightly warm air coming
out of here that's drawing heat away
from the graphics cards and other than
that most of the internal specs are the
same but the first thing I want to show
you is the CPU temps so we are running
the H 70 so we are getting temperatures
only as high as 60 degrees that is with
all 12 threads on this 980 X he did
upgrade to a 980 x6 core CPU all 12
threads are at a hundred percent using
prime95 small FFT so now we can take the
side panel off and obviously the
temperatures are gonna get even a little
bit better once we remove the side panel
okay so here we go so I'll show you all
of the other tweaks that he made to his
personal config first he changed to an
HX 850 watt power supply from the TX 850
power supply that is in the spec that
allows us to maintain better cable
management in this small case so we can
make sure we have adequate airflow
bringing air from the front of the case
here from these two 120mm fans over to
the graphics cards okay so that's one
change that he made another change that
he made is the added a killer Nick 2100
these run like crazy Black Friday promo
for $49.99 so yeah it's kind of a
no-brainer at that price okay we've also
added
a storage drive now instead of using the
WD green series he opted for a
Velociraptor series drive in addition to
his OCD vertex to SSD and then I believe
that is Elia finally of course he
upgraded to a 90 DX six core processor
from the 950 quad-core that we normally
use so yeah you can clearly see that
there now as an experiment we kind of
built what built the system for him and
this is right out of our production lab
this is not a prototype built by crazy
Russian or anything like that so this is
pretty much what you can expect if you
buy a system from NCIX and so we also
wanted to run some 3d benchmarks to
ensure that even with the side panel
closed we're not going to get any
overheating because two GTX 480 S is for
ATS 580 s is a pretty significant heat
load and we also found that even with
the 2 5 ATS the six core processor etc
etc there is no overheating now another
thing that people seem to be concerned
about night I can't imagine why with our
Avesta 6050 prototype was that we were
using an 850 watt power supply with two
GTX 580 s well it's fine I can tell you
that right now even with the 90 DX
upgrade that we've made here this system
running prime95 in the background
running 3dmark Vantage pulls no more
than 726 watts from the wall now
factoring in the HX 850 is about 88%
efficient
that means that we are actually pulling
no more than 650 watts from that power
supply well within its rated capacity
you've got an extra 200 watts of
additional power available yeah you're
not going to be adding another GTX 580
with that kind of o of an overhead but
you also don't have to worry about
adding any additional drives or adding a
sound card or adding some more RAM
that's a non concern with 200 watts of
additional room it also means that that
I mean that's only when you're under the
highest load okay so when you're at idle
you're pulling like a very very small
portion of what this
suppliers capable of achieving so we're
gonna run Vantage for you guys I'm going
to put the side panel back on so you've
seen the max temps with the Corsair h7t
running with full load on the CPU but I
also want to show you guys just how high
the graphics cards get when we close
this up and let it cook alright so we
finished our Vantage test we've got SLI
enabled obviously physics however is off
just so that we have scores that are
more easily reproducible if you want to
compare at home and you can see we
scored 36,000 3d marks and Vantage that
is in the performance mode you can tell
by the P at the beginning and then the
hottest that our GPUs got are 87 degrees
on the top GPU and eighty degrees on the
bottom one that is pretty darn good
although I have to tell you guys in some
of the testing we did see it peak up
around as high as 90 but you know it's
still well within reason for GTX 580 I
also meant to mention that one of the
other small tweaks that was made for
this machine was dual 120 millimeter
fans in the front rather than only a
single and a card reader so that while
the card reader is not all that
significant but the the changes to the
front intake are somewhat significant so
thanks for checking out this little
video on one of our well I mean I could
call it a Vesta 60 50 but it's fairly
customized because we did have to use a
different case and revalidate the
thermals for that different case but
yeah thanks for checking out the video
on this custom system from NCIX and
don't forget to subscribe to - tech tips
for more PC videos technology videos on
boxing's reviews I have no idea what he
said other stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
