cool as a master sword but pretty cool
regardless this case is cooler master's
attempt to glom on to the maker movement
and feed into that mentality and they do
this through therefore a free-form
modular system what the heck does that
mean stay tuned to find out and like
this video if you want to see another
trolling at pax prime
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their all-new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors click now to learn
more so what the heck is the freeform
modular system well at its base level
what Coolermaster is trying to do is
make a case that is largely constructed
using screws and other modular
connections so that you will be able to
swap things out easily say you'll be
able to swap out the top IO for
something like USBC compatibility throw
redundant power supplies in the bottom
mounted reservoir in your hard drive bay
area put tempered glass on the sides or
even on the front hook up a graphics
card mount support so you don't have
heavy cards droop and much much more
they're also planning on somewhat
leaning on the community here so if you
have any suggestions for anything be
sure to let them know on Twitter at
coolermaster now let's get to the base
system case we have here today the
unmodern aster mastercase pro 5 this
case is quite sturdy as you can see I
don't actually recommend standing on
this case but it's an impressive sight
nonetheless moving on we have the front
of the case there's two five and a
quarter inch bay covers and a large
filtered front panel below that up above
we have the IO on an angled part of the
top of the case up here you have two USB
3.0 ports a hard drive activity light
power and reset buttons and a headphone
and microphone jack on the left side
panel there's a very large square cutout
with a slightly tinted window and in the
bottom there's an option for a black
panel that will cover your power supply
and some hard drive gauges this is
easily removed by removing two screws if
you do want to show off that sweet sweet
juice machine the right side panel is
fairly plain but both of them feature
hanging thumb screws and when you remove
the panel it won't fall off right away
the bottom of it will hinge on the case
until you lift it out a nice touch
moving to the top there is a removable
bracket which houses a filter and covers
up another removable bracket which you
can install to 120 or 140 millimeter
fans and their respective radiators this
is nice because you can do the annoying
set of screwing in your rad and fans
outside of the case instead of fighting
with it on the inside last of all there
are handles up here possibly
immediately apparent but they're there
and they seem pretty sturdy as well on
the bottom of the case you have the
power supply filter and to bottom
supports which have two rubber feet each
these support legs are removable as well
which is great to see even though the
majority of you will probably be leaving
them on the back of the case supports
one 140 millimeter and 120 millimeter
fan in the same spot which can be placed
slightly higher or slightly lower in
order to line up with your air cooler of
your choice and the power supply is
mounted using a nifty little external
bracket so now for a look at the inside
of the case starting with the front we
see mounts for three 140 millimeter fans
two of which are included you can also
choose to mount a 280 millimeter
radiator here but because of the cases
top shroud you can't install a triple
rad just behind these fan mounts is a
modular drive based system the master
case comes with a total of three drive
cages two for hard drives and SSDs and a
third for your two five and a quarter
inch bays if you're still into those
kind of things the position of the hard
drive cages can be adjusted vertically
for better air flow or cable management
or just removed completely if you're not
really using any mechanical drives and
that can be easily adjusted or taken out
with thumb screws one thing that I liked
is how the cages didn't just fall down
after I took out the thumb screws you
have to pull on them just a little bit
so they don't go crashing down into the
floor of your case each cage has two
lists slide-in mounts with anti
vibration rubber pads now thing we
haven't seen before but still nice one
of these cages is in the basement area
that's becoming more common on cases
these days it contains both the power
supply and a mount for the hard drive
cage that we mentioned before or some
maker stuff if you want to go that way
which can be moved from the front of the
case if you need extra clearance or
something like that radiator that drops
down on top of the basement or a pair of
SSD brackets that are to install with
just a single thumb screw but keep in
mind that these brackets do hide your
SSDs which you may or may not like
depending on how you want your bill to
look you'll also find a power supply
mount down here which includes
anti-vibration rails and a removable
dust filter which we've mentioned
earlier and when it's time to do
something with all those cords coming
out of your power supply the master case
offers some pretty good cable management
options you get three
large rubber lined grommets along the
right hand side of the motherboard tray
two holes on top and two more holes on
top of the basement for SSD cables as
well as anything that you might need to
plug into the bottom of your motherboard
the back of the motherboard tray inside
the backside of the case has velcro
straps for all of your front panel
cables which are neatly pre managed as
well as a couple cable loops for your
eight pin connector and while these
things are nice I would have liked maybe
some more stock cable management
features but in the accessories bin
there are two stick honorable cable loop
things which you can utilize and
speaking of the motherboard tray the
accessories kit includes a little
standoff socket that you can place on
the end of your screwdriver enabling you
to screw them in with just a screwdriver
instead of struggling with your fingers
very cool so in conclusion it's a pretty
standard case a good standard case but
standard nonetheless for the moment at
least it has the chance of evolving in
the future that chance relies on the
community giving coolermaster feedback
and an input on what they would like to
see this case grow into and it relies on
Coolermaster following up on those
suggestions and unlocking the various
possibilities that they have thought of
and that the community has thought of as
well I'm sure they're listening so give
them your suggestions in the comments
