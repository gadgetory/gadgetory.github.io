forget it
course RHA tigt in each one hundred-eyed
GTX liquid coolers improve both the
appearance and the cooling performance
of your PC click this little button
right here to learn more so let's just
do the unboxing then without the without
trying to slate this this is pretty
exciting it came I was absolutely
floored by how heavy it was I actually
had a really hard time getting it out of
the are outer cardboard packaging I mean
other than the size it's pretty much
exactly the same as the box that the
silver one comes in I think they give
you a slightly different letter actually
you get a shorter letter 100,000
subscribers that's more than double the
size of liquidy blue PT you delivered
the audience at YouTube you set the gold
standard etc etc thanks for being
awesome sincerely let this one's blurry
I'm starting to feel kind of ripped off
here with this one million subscriber
hibbity jibbity alright so let's take
off the foam cover and that my friends
is an extremely large wall plaque that I
have no freaking idea where I'm going to
be able to hang up but one that I am
extremely proud of and extremely
thankful to you guys for making possible
because let's face it unless a million
of you actually it's gonna by the time
this video is published it'll be closer
to 1.4 million but you know takes up I'm
sure it takes a little while to make
these and ship them out it takes a
million of you to click that button for
us to get this plaque and it's extremely
exciting I mean it yeah it's uh it
really makes me think about what it took
for us to get here because some people
have very explosive growth on YouTube
and they sort of start up their channel
and then all of a sudden it's like oh
I'm huge now with us it was a very
gradual progression we went from this
kind of handheld style before to this
more presenter type style we started
scripting and we've gone through so much
evolution that I feel like I I don't
explain enough to you guys I mean at the
very beginning of Linus tech tips all it
was was away because I had no time a way
to have videos on product pages
extremely quickly we never expected
anyone to subscribe to watch me open a
box that wasn't the plan we just
expected people to know what was inside
that motherboard so they'd know if they
had to like buy an extra SATA cable when
they you know built their PC that was
all we really wanted from it and
honestly the reason that I think of what
I think was a huge part of the success
at the time was the quantity of videos
that I produced I was doing up to one
and a half videos per day 45 videos a
month early in the process so I would go
out in the parking lot and I would shoot
10 at a time in a given in a given week
with the old NCIX cameraman who still
works at NCIX by the land honestly that
that wasn't something that we planned we
didn't kind of carefully go well gee I
think 45 is probably about the right
number of monthly videos that was my
quota I mean I was employee at NCIX it
was like okay we need to have videos on
all these product pages how are we going
to do it we've got one guy who makes
videos you better make a lot of them but
that was that was the entire that was
the entire plan I'm so the style like
the the off-the-cuff you know penis
jokey kind of getting things wrong and
just kind of rolling with its style
developed just naturally not out of a
plan but just because that's who I am
and I had no time to do anything better
so when we eventually split from NCIX
and I I hired my first two employees
Luke and Etzel and we became Linus Media
Group the objective wasn't for us to you
know keep doing 45 unboxings a month at
Mino with the lowest possible quality to
get you know to get products cuz that
was another thing I loved about making
these videos
yet I would get access to all these
products and while I was often you know
reviewing some graphics card in the
middle of a freaking night and uploading
my video at you know 4 a.m. or whatever
else I mean it was fun I enjoyed it it
was it was a total it was a total blast
but all of a sudden we were out on our
own you know there were three of us now
so you had real mouths to feed I can't I
can't pay people in graphics cards
unfortunately as much as as much as I
wish that were the case because we
certainly have lots of them so we had to
figure out how to evolve and one of the
first things we did was we started
another channel tech wiki which is
coming up on 500,000 subscribers which
is extremely exciting and another thing
we did was we pushed to improve our
quality and that was something a lot of
people objected to they kind of went
well no we love the like the camp you
know handheld move in and around the
product style of Linus tech tips we
don't want anything different but I
think the results show that it was the
it was the right thing for us to do
because it's enabled us to to experiment
with our content in ways that we never
could before
from the humble beginnings in the garage
back when we were you know recruiting
for for interns because it was the only
way we could get all of our work done
because we had no money in no time
we now have six employees we're moving
into our new headquarters in about two
months and the future is an extremely
extremely exciting prospect for us and
that's really a big subject that I want
to talk about in this video today now
you guys may have seen the news quite
recently that YouTube is cracking down
on the ability of content creators like
us to monetize their content
independently in certain ways and to be
quite clear I understand why they're
doing it they take a 45 percent cut of
the Google Adsense revenue for those
little text ads that pop up or those
pre-rolls that run before the videos and
that's what you know Google figures is
YouTube's cut for hosting this video
service and bringing the subscribers to
you but where that gets tricky is that
that is completely beyond our control we
can't affect you know Google's CPMs that
is the amount of money we make per
thousand views we can't affect that in
any meaning
we can't affect whether Google actually
serves ads on to our videos or puts them
somewhere else because they're always
playing algorithmic numbers on their
sides and one of the big problems that's
come up recently you guys might have
seen the video that game theory game
theory did about the subscriber boxes
Google's not even delivering the
audience to us in the way that we
expected anymore where they're playing
games with what shows up in people's
subscriber feeds even if they have
subscribed to your channel depending on
what they're watching at the time so
things are going to change over the next
little bit you're still going to see
integrations in our videos because we've
found ways to make it so that they fall
within YouTube's rules and we can still
continue to talk about you know Dollar
Shave Club or Squarespace or Intel or
whatever else the case may be but we're
going to be looking for different ways
to cover our butts in case that goes way
all of a sudden because unlike other
channels that have maybe one primary
host who also does all the shooting and
all the editing it's a one-man show
where the only consequence if you know
their revenue is cut in half is that
they make half as much money but are
still very comfortable for us we have
half a dozen employees we've banked on
being able to turn this into a business
that can really support us and allow us
to grow personally and professionally
so we have to we have to keep finding
different ways to do that there are a
number of ways that we've already been
doing over the last little bit so things
like t-shirts things like a monthly
contributions for our forum you get
clean kind of like a cool badge if you
join our community and stuff like that
but we also have to find ways to reach
you guys that are that are different so
we might start to leverage you know
creating an emailing mail list or
something like that hey did you miss our
videos because yo your subscriber fee
doesn't work we may also experiment in
fact this is pretty much a foregone
conclusion at this point with other
video platforms such as vessel where
there's an incentive in terms of better
ad revenue for us to release our content
they're a little bit earlier than
YouTube so stay tuned for all of that I
guess that's the plan thank you very
much for being here with us all this way
it's been an extremely exciting ride and
here's to the next million or
by the time you're watching about
600,000 and I hope you guys continue to
be a part of it as we push forward into
newer excuse me I'm getting all
emotional into newer and more exciting
content formats like the recent
scrapyard Wars that's definitely
something we want to do more of because
we hear you guys loud and clear that's
what you want to see and I do hope you
know that we are listening over here
speaking of listening like the video if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it we do listen to that leave a comment
preferably on the forum we have that
linked in the video description we do
listen to that as well also linked in
the forum we've got somewhere where you
can buy that merch I was talking about
give us a monthly contribution like I
was talking about change your amazon
bookmark to one of our affiliate code
like I was talking about I should
probably do like a detailed guide for
that and actually I've had a lot of
people ask me for it but for now it's
linked in the video description and I
think that pretty much wraps it up as
always don't forget to subscribe to
