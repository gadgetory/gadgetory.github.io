this is magical this is like more
magical than the iPad which the late
Steve Jobs declared to be magical
therefore it is magical this is magical
this is a powerline AV wireless network
extender an existing in-home powerline
network is required for use okay
understood the PLW 400 what does it do
it easily extends your wired and
wireless network coverage in your home
yes your wired and wireless network
coverage in your home you know I'm gonna
go find ok so if you already have one of
these where you got like you know your
powerline like somewhere you know this
is where nuber your router is in your
modem this is in like Johnny's room to
power his computer because you know the
walls are made of leather
the paint is lettered you know you know
you really shouldn't use lead paint your
kids will be like damaged by that okay
so Johnny's room is painted with lead
and wireless doesn't work so we have
powerline running to there so we buy
this third adapter which just
automatically like syncs up with the
other guys you might have to press the
sync button whatever no big deal what
this does maybe we take this down to
like the media room in the basement okay
so you use the network jack here to plug
into delicate electrical just looks like
trying to look closely at the tiny
picture on the box it's like why are we
doing this we're just going to open it
there we go there we go so we use the
Ethernet port on the bottom to run to
like a switch which powers like then the
media PC and the TV with Ethernet and
all the gadgets that I'm sure you can
all you know have and in your media room
that everyone has a media room I don't
have a media room but um right so that
goes there and then because it's in the
basement it's far away and you use lead
paint in your house or for whatever
reason you don't have good wireless
reception it also extends your wireless
network so it's a range extender that
doesn't have your bandwidth because it's
using half of its signal to send and
half of a signal to receive and it's
like bridging these two zones this is a
range extender that has wired
essentially as the backbone and then it
just has a wireless network really like
wireless
Inchon hotspot wherever it happens to be
so this is the most magical thing ever
because now instead of going you know
trying to boost the signal to your
antenna or like buying a wireless
extender you just throw these all over
your house and you'll have like just the
most beast possible wireless coverage
throughout your entire house just by
using little guys like this and because
wireless bandwidth is so inconsequential
even though these are only 200 megabit
per second that wired connection it's
still more than enough for anything you
would do wirelessly on something like a
tablet or a phone or whatever else the
case may be we have an Ethernet cable
that is included we have a set up TD
which you should know I don't know go
ahead and use it actually link sis's
stuff is pretty good like it doesn't
waste a lot of your time and it's pretty
straightforward
ok package content wire transfer speeds
up to 2 it's 2.4 gigahertz so it's not a
dual band or anything fancy like that
but it gives you extended home coverage
and it has a ten hundred Ethernet port
which is all it really needs supports
WPS I think that's pretty much it so if
you guys don't understand yet how
magical this is like like post in the
comments and let either me or one of the
other users to like help you understand
that it's magical because it really is
there's a reset switch here protection
button WPS all your indicator LEDs
on/off switch and your Ethernet port and
the plug that goes into the wall thank
