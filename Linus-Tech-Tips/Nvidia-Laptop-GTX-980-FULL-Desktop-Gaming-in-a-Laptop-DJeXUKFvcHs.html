check out something pretty freakin
interesting a GeForce GTX 980 now why is
that interesting we've had these for a
while it's in a laptop and no it doesn't
have a little m denomination after it
so yes it is a full desktop GPU it has
2048 CUDA cores a base clock of 11:26 a
boost clock of 1216 a memory clock of 6
gigabits per second which you just don't
see in laptops 4 gigabytes of memory a
256 bit interface width and yeah it's
seriously a 980 in a laptop Nvidia
unsurprisingly is binning specific 980
chips for this because they need good
well binge 980 s for this because it has
to sit in the laptop it has to fit
within certain specifications also
they're going to be in laptops that have
four to eight phase-- power supplies
which is beast mode and not something
you used to seeing on a laptop often you
see two to three phase power supplies
not four to eight it has record-breaking
performance on air which is not very
surprising but we'll see what people can
do to it down the line and they're going
to be working with laptop manufacturers
to have it so that the CPU and the GPU
are fully unlocked and overclocking
ready they're also working with those
laptop manufacturers to pump more
cooling options into these units of up
to 50% more apparently in some use cases
and that should help because you'll be
able to tweak fan speed profiles if you
want to go really loud and get more
overclocking great you want to be
quieter and maybe get a little bit less
overclocking that's great as well in
terms of overclocking you'll be able to
change core clock speeds and memory
clock speeds like I mentioned earlier
but not power limit or voltage limit as
it's a laptop and messing with those
things can be a little bit more
dangerous than on a desktop where you
will have more leeway now they were
serious about this and actually let me
tinker and mess around with some of the
laptops which is pretty freaking cool I
was able to benchmark a thinner kind of
gigabyte a aureus laptop a OSX 7 which
was pretty badass and a thicker clev Oh
on the other side so alongside of those
I tested a normal system which had a
kind of generalized setup and a desktop
980 in it and we got to see the
performance numbers in things like fire
strike extreme tomb raider
shadow of Mordor and Metro last light
which was pretty impressive because they
claimed that there would be about a
delta of maybe 5% and in a lot of cases
it was less than that these systems were
really really close and that's even
considering other components in these
laptops like CPU which you have to take
into the equation here so it's badass
it's a full desktop CPU in a laptop and
it actually runs properly and it's
overclockable on top of that impressive
but what else is there also two geforce
experience they are bringing VR
optimization so with the 950 we saw a
low latency optimisation for stuff like
MOBAs and there's normal optimization
which is more well rounded and then
we're going to be seeing the our
optimization which is pretty awesome so
the idea behind this is tweaking your
settings is something that a lot of
people like doing and one of the reasons
why someone may not actually use GeForce
experience others like it others don't
but in VR I think that line is going to
blur a little bit more because tweaking
settings is going to be very annoying
when you strap a screen to your face and
then something's wrong you can get sick
or it can be pretty disturbing very
quickly
so knowing that everything's just going
to kind of work is a pretty big benefit
I'm excited are you excited let me know

stuff because it's cool thanks for
watching I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
