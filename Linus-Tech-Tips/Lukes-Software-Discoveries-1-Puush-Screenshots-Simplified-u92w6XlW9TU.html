admit the day I discovered snipping
tool' was probably one of the greatest
days of my life I was so sick and tired
of taking a screenshot opening paint
pasting it in cropping it saving it
uploading it and finally embedding it
and trust me I took a lot of screenshots
and I still take a lot of screenshots
snipping tool allowed me to take that
seven step process down to about four
and today I'm extremely happy to say
I've been able to take it down again
thanks to push to to the flash voyager
dt x USB 3 drive from corsair provides
SSD like performance and fits
comfortably in your pocket click now to
learn more the process of a quarrying
push is quite quick and simple first we
need to go to push me best URL ever and
download your installation file for your
preferred platform Windows Mac OS or iOS
now all you need to do is go through the
simple installation process and register
on their website which is again quite
simple now that you're fully installed
and logged in you can perform a range of
tasks like capture fullscreen fairly
self-explanatory it captures the full
screen and all the screens if you're in
a multi-monitor setup in one picture
capture current window which will
capture the currently selected window
capture area which will let you drag and
drop a selection box for what you want
to capture very similar to snipping tool
upload file which lets you upload any
file up to 20 megabytes if you are a
free user and one thing to note here is
that if you need to upload a media file
like music or video you'll be able to
play that back in the browser which is a
nice handy little addition and last but
not least is upload clipboard which will
take whatever you currently have in your
clipboard that's your ctrl C and turn it
into a text file and publish that which
will be easily readable in your browser
as well speaking of which any of these
tasks can be bound to whatever set of
keys you would like and when you press
set keys to perform set action there
will be an ever so slight delay before
you hear a notification sound and there
will also be a pop-up on your taskbar
clicking that pop-up will open said
upload in your browser or if you're just
sending the push to someone we're
embedding it somewhere push has you
covered and will automatically put that
into your clipboard so after you push
something just press control V and the
link is already there there are also a
few interesting things
going on in general settings as a free
account user your files are going to be
removed after they haven't been accessed
for about a month and this could cause
an issue for you as becoming a pro user
is currently an impossible
I would suggest backing up your pushes
which is quite easy to do by simply
telling push to save a local copy to a
predestined folder on the website side
of things you can access an archive of
items you've uploaded in either the
public or private folders private is the
default by the way but you can change
that by going into the account settings
personally I like that but maybe you
want all of your pushes to be public for
whatever reason now push is great for me
but I can't do everything possibly for
you so if you're a Linux user maybe look
into a program called shudder if you're
looking for something more aesthetically
pleasing maybe look into tiny grab and
last but not least if you're an imgur
imager user whatever you want to call it
check out in ger comm slash apps and
you'll be able to find a ton of stuff
there that will help you upload things
to Ingrid what I'm trying to say is that
I like push but there's many other
programs out there that can do very
similar things try and find the one that
works best for you speaking of which
what image sharing program does work the
best for you if you use them I'd like to
know tell me in the comments below tell
me on the forum like the video dislike
the video favorite before yeah doesn't
do what I'm talking about at all
but that's cool I guess also don't
forget to subscribe and on the forum if
you want to get rid of all the ads
become a contributor if you want a shirt
that has nothing to do with a very old
band that I used to like when I was a
kid check out this shirt link in the
description below thanks for watching
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
