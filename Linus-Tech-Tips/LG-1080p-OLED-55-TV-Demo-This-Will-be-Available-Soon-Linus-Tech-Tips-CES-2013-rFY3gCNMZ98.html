our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys welcome to the LG booth where
they have a behind me a basically
production model Oh LED 55 inch TV
they're already taking pre-orders for
this in Korea and it's expected to be
available in North America sometime
around March it's not going to be cheap
okay so it's gonna be about twelve
thousand dollars so you know yeah bling
bling and all that but you do get all
the benefits that come along with o le D
that is the deeper blacks brighter light
so better contrast ratio the fact that
the response times are significantly
reduced and of course the more vibrant
colors one of the other advantages whoa
LED is that there are fewer layers that
need to be stacked together which means
they can actually take the TVs and make
them thinner the TV behind me has an
extremely slim bezel and weighs only
twenty pounds and I am now going to show
you guys something that was kind of
hidden from you before I'd like the
whole crew to shift a little bit to
stage left there is an actual TV that
was right behind me the whole time and
I'm willing to bet a hundred bucks right
now that you didn't even see it there
thanks for watching Linus tech tips at
CES 2013 powered by Corsair seagate
technology and linksys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
