about putting something on a test bench
in quite some time we've got our whole
room water cooling setup video series
and well just doing it building five
systems that are all running on the same
water cooling loop and then spitting the
heat out of the house sort of project
coming up but of course there's some
preparation that needs to be done so I
always preach to people that especially
if you're going to be liquid cooling a
rig you should really be building it
air-cooled outside of a case first to
make sure that everything is working
before you go and put a bunch of work
into it
so this is the first one that I'll be
testing out with the purchase of a
qualifying Intel processor SSD or nook
you could instantly win and Intel gaming
Jersey and be entered in the draw for
the ultimate system click now to learn
more so here it is here's the setup that
my son is helping me with are you going
to build that one okay good job you work
on that all right well I show everyone
the hardware that we are going to be
putting into these rigs now this one is
the one that I'm really excited about
because it's not quite the same as the
others they are all getting kingston 240
gig SSDs for the boot drives because
most of our storage is going to be on
the nest they're all getting cooler
master v-series 750 watt power supplies
so they're modular power supplies are
you plus gold all that good stuff we're
not overdoing it on the wattage because
there's really a benefit to that they're
all getting NVIDIA GTX Titan Black
Edition cards zoom out a little bit
taking all of its glory and they're all
running on a sous x79 deluxe motherboard
this really does a great job of those
high-end boards and we we really like
this particular one quite a lot but
while most of them will be running core
i7s and then 32 gigs of ddr3 memory this
one will be running high yes what's that
okay it might only say 2.7 gigahertz on
the spreader there but that's a pretty
good 2.7 gigahertz because it's - all 12
of its cores and 24 threads this is
going to be a Xeon based workstation as
opposed to a core i7
one and along with that Zeon we've got
64 gigs of kingston ddr3 because instead
of 32 gigs like the other workstations
this one is getting double the memory
because Ed's 'el is a memory hog and
needs pretty much as much RAM as I can
throw at him that's also why he's
getting the 12 core Xeon because for
certain workloads like say for example
3d rendering you're going to get more
benefit from more cores than you will
from faster course so unfortunately we
can't make use of ECC memory which would
allow us to get higher capacities like
128 gigs on one board using 16 gig dims
but eight 8 gig dims for a total of 64
gigs hopefully we'll be enough for him
for the time being now one thing I've
asked Kingston for is some higher speed
memory for that rig because again with
the other ones it doesn't matter that
much so we'll see if they come through
and send us some 1866 stuff but for now
we're going to do the pre build and
validation and get going on this so the
build process for this rig isn't really
anything exceptional I mean it's
motherboard CPU Ram it's all that stuff
it's just the hardware that we're using
that's pretty darn cool so as always it
starts with the board I did notice the
CPU was a little bit different it's
actually actually wider than most LGA
2011 CPUs then putting in all that Ram
was one of those chores that you have to
kind of enjoy a little bit there's
something satisfying about putting 64
gigs of rennes into a system stick by
stick by stick by stick after that it's
time to put some thermal compound on the
CPU then we're going to get our power
supply in place get that plugged into
the motherboard something to know guys I
put the power supply in fan side down
that would suffocate it that's bad make
sure fan side is up ignore the b-roll I
did fix that before I actually turn the
system on after that we're going to go
ahead and get the water cooling
installed so you put in the four posts
put the block over top of the thermal
compound we already applied we're using
a dual radiator liquid cooling system
even though when this is done it'll
actually be hooked up to something much
cooler and much more extreme I would
plug in our SSD and then the cherry on
top is the GTX
in black edition so that's it guys it's
done uh this is this is part of the
process building something outside of
the box to make sure that everything is
running okay and this is it moment of
truth times let's go ahead and flip the
switch on the power supply and there we
go hopefully everything works all the
action is happening here until the
screen illuminates so as long as that
whoa okay keep doing things yeah there
we go okay so let's see if all went well
we should see something about 12 cores
and 64 gigs of RAM on the screen at some
point here there we go the real
something something twenty-seven hundred
megahertz okay sixty-five I guess think
round gigs of RAM CPU fatter all right
everything is detected let's head into
the BIOS and do some rudimentary tuning
so the first thing that you're always
going to want to do is I head over to
advanced mode because advanced modes for
cool kids and then change it so that it
boots into advanced mode every time and
now you know normally a normal person's
reaction to a rig like this might be wow
I've never touched a CPU that's worth
$2,500 I better be extremely careful
with it but my reactions so we're going
to go with that can we overclock it a
little bit now Zeon's
are not overclockable the same way that
core i7 czar on this platform where you
just turn up the multiplier and it's off
to the races in fact I'll show you guys
if we try to change the multiplier to
anything higher than 27 it just
automatically changes to 27 so we're not
going to be able to use the multiplier
to overclock now on modern Intel
platforms its multiplier times base
clock equals the overall frequency and
you can overclock base clock but not
much on early x79 boards you were lucky
to get maybe one hundred and five
megahertz so we're gonna see if we can
get even 105 makers because that'll be a
five percent overclock on 12 cores
so I'm going to show you guys what we're
going to try so first of all we change
to manual
- daisies change to manual we're going
to key in 105 here then for the ratio we
want Auto for the DRAM frequency
normally we would leave it at 1600
megahertz because this is 1600 megahertz
Ram but in this case I don't really I'm
not really a huge fan of overclocking
memory if you don't have to I mean we
can play around with it later but first
we want to make sure our CPU stable so
we're going to pick something that is
going to give us a frequency that is
lower than 1600 megahertz so that we
know that memory is not holding us back
here extreme low voltage we're not going
to over volt the CPU as much as I
believe in you know trying to squeeze a
little bit more performance out of a
chip like this it's a 12 core chip we're
not going to go and just throw more
volts at it the last thing we want is to
damage the thing so we're going to be
going for whatever we can get without
over volting it and potentially reducing
the lifespan this is a work machine not
like a gaming rig so we can't afford any
any instability so these are not XMP
memory modules so we're going to key in
our voltage manually and you know what
I'm not going to bore you guys with the
tediousness of keying in all that other
stuff manually so let's just go ahead
and find the last thing I need that are
you CPU configuration the last thing I
want is to make sure that turbo boost is
on it might be somewhere in here then
see if you performance settings here we
go yeah so turbo mode needs to be
enabled so now what we've effectively
done by leaving the core ratio at Auto
and increasing our base clock is we've
made it so that our CPU will continue to
turbo all the way up to 3.5 gigahertz
plus 5% in a single threaded application
and while it would normally turbo to 3
gigahertz with all 12 cores we're going
to get 30 150 megahertz so a 5 percent
improvement let's see how it goes
alright so here we are at the desktop
it's time to validate that the settings
that we put in actually took because
again this is not normal Hardware so you
know who knows um so
look at that okay we're turbo 23.5
something gigahertz just yet there you
go normally which means there it is we
are running at a hundred and five
megahertz base clock so I guess we have
overclocked the CPU so the tools we're
going to use two stress tested are i-264
and we're going to just start a stress
test and assuming it doesn't crash
pretty much immediately we're going to
start creeping up that base clock and
see if we can get a little bit higher
because I think 105 is going to be
pretty easy we're not really asking it
for much so we're gonna we're going to
push it and see how much further we can
get it one thing I do want to know
before we proceed though is what our
temperatures like huh very comfortable
sitting at around 55 degrees that's
without the water heating up that that
won't matter when we're running on a
whole room liquid cooling setup now will
it so I'm going to show you guys once we
see that it sort of passes for a couple
seconds here how we can avoid rebooting
into Windows every time in order
rebooting into the UEFI BIOS every time
in order to test new things so we're
going to go into the TPU tab of AI suite
which is not my favorite piece of
software but we're just kind of using it
to save some time here boo-boo yeah I
know AI sweet you're trying real hard
okay and then we can actually change
base clock on the fly setting increment
by increment then we just apply it do
you want to load it yes so we can change
all of this stuff on the fly run a new
stability test and keep going until it
doesn't go anymore so it ended up
pushing a lot further than I expected I
had to bring it into the office to
continue testing I ran out of time
because I kept expecting at every stage
one more beat clock no it passes so this
is what we ended up with any further
than this and we can't we can't push it
any further it'll just lock up as soon
as we try to run a stress test but here
it is 113 megahertz base clock that
gives us three point three nine
gigahertz with 12 cores running actually
unfreaking believable so this is going
to be one heck of a high-performance
workstation and
it is a hundred percent rock-solid at
this setting no problems whatsoever very
very exciting so stay tuned guys because
this is just one of the machines for our
five system multi system room wide
liquid cooling setup that we're going to
be doing soon it is the most exciting
one with 64 gigs of RAM as well as that
12 core CPU but the other ones will be
cool too
speaking of all them cores or something
