we're at the airport okay okay well blur
trust me we're at the airport it's that
way and we're back with our top five
laptops from the show sponsored by Intel
we've got some real doozies in the
lineup this year so without further ado
let's get started first up is Samsung's
first-ever gaming laptop The Odyssey 15
now Samsung isn't a thing that you would
immediately think of when someone says
gaming system unless maybe you're
thinking of mobile but the Odyssey 15
looks like a capable performer that
comes with an Intel 7 stand core i7
processor and NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU and a
1080p display which makes sense given
its mid-range graphics chip the bottom
has an interesting design that Samsung
calls Dragon Scale it's version of a
vent and heatsink to keep everything
cool and you can pick up an Odyssey for
around 1500 bucks moving right along
is a laptop that is impossible to ignore
this behemoth is the Acer predator 21x
this thing tries to recreate the
high-end desktop battlestation
experience in laptop form with features
like a curved 2560 by 1080 120 Hertz
ultra wide display with g-sync
dual NVIDIA GTX 1080s and overclockable
core i7 7820 Tobi eye-tracking
support for 4 SSDs Cherry MX brown fully
mechanical key switches a touchpad that
flips over to become a number pad and
all of this can be yours for the value
price of only 9 thousand US dollars
starting in February and while that's
awfully steep you probably won't be
wanting for anything either except for
maybe some external monitors since
you're a baller next up another model
rocking the GTX 1050 is the Inspiron 15
7000 gaming from Dell which comes in an
attractive red and black design without
being too over-the-top gamer tastic
along with the GTX 1050 you get a 7th
gen Core i5 processor and a 10
ATP screen the base model comes with
four gigs of RAM in a one terabyte hard
drive so not exactly the highest-end
config you'll see out there but the good
news is this laptop starts at eight
hundred bucks and if you save a few more
pennies you can outfit it with more
memory an SSD and even a gtx 1050 TI
next we've got the lenovo Legion Y 720
it packs a bit more punch than the
Odyssey 15 with an NVIDIA GTX 1060 for
VR support and an optional 15.6 inch 4k
display it's got an RGB keyboard and a
PCI Express SSD but perhaps even more
interestingly it has an integrated Xbox
controller wireless receiver so if you
want to use a separate controller for
gaming you don't have to mess around
with plugging in a dongle even if you're
playing with three friends there's also
Dolby Atmos support and it should be
available starting in April at around
1400 bucks last but definitely not least
is the Dell XPS 13 2 &amp;amp; 1 this pretty
little number bears a lot of resemblance
to its non two-in-one cousin and that's
a good thing it features a carbon fiber
and aluminum construction a Y series 7th
generation Core i5 or Core i7 processor
up to 16 gigs of ram a backlit keyboard
a fingerprint scanner windows hello for
easy sign-in a 1080p or 3200 by 1800
high DPI virtually borderless
touchscreen display and the ability to
operate in any of three different modes
depending on what's most ergonomic and
convenient Dell even managed to pack
Thunderbolt 3 and an additional USB
type-c connector making this a
lightweight and very solid feeling
powerhouse so thanks for watching our
top 5 laptops of CES 2017 this will
probably be one of the last videos from
the show this year so I bid you all
adieu until next year that is to say
unless you watch our other videos as
well in which case I'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
