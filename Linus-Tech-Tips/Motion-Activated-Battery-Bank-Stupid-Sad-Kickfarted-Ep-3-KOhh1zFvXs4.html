a series that we do on crowd funded
projects through Kickstarter IndieGoGo
or whatever other platform that ship but
don't exactly hit the mark today we're
going to be looking at the amp II move
the world's first wearable motion
charger it's a portable smartphone
battery that charges as you move yeah
until skull Canyon knock features a
sixth-generation a core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more in the link in
the video description the amp II
Kickstarter was wildly successful they
raised three hundred nine thousand three
hundred and twenty three dollars they
were featured in a number of major
publications as well people got excited
and I get it they make you feel really
good about wanting to buy one they say
stuff like your movement is your power
your movement is your power hell yeah it
is MP captures the energy from your
movement throughout the day and uses it
to power your phone and other wearables
they talk about the future about how one
day maybe their technology will be
integrated into smartwatches and
wearables so you never have to plug them
in again we're so excited about what's
to come one day our technology can be
integrated directly into smart watches
fitness trackers and other crazy
wearables that haven't been invented yet
so you never have to
damn they're so cool I love this stuff
and I mean like look at this right on
the front of the box it says one hour of
exercise equals five hours of smartphone
battery life and just within the front
cover it says that this battery can
charge one full smartphone charge no
asterisks that's just what they're
saying they go on to state that people
have a problem with their phones dying
before the end of the day we all have
the same problem our phones would die
before the end of the day so many people
have this problem oh my god I have that
problem please take my money and they
did which is why we're here today
delivering why's they were okay we
received ours mostly on time with their
websites still being up and you can
currently buy them on Amazon that puts
stride technologies inc ahead of a lot
of other crowdfunded companies but i
must say in response to a headline that
someone from BuzzFeed copy pasted from
another one of their articles why has no
one invented this before well BuzzFeed
here's the top three reasons why one it
barely works - they exaggerated its
capabilities and three this is key I
would hardly classify this as an
invention nothing in it is a new
technology and now if your attention
span is so impressive that you can get
beyond BuzzFeed keep watching to learn
more as we transition into the actual
review section of this video well it's a
battery that charges with movement so to
begin I gave it to three different
people and told them to do three
different things with it
Taron biked around some city roads for a
little bit and then did some various
workouts in the gym with it Nick van
Berkel took it with him on a BMX bike to
a pump track both of these scenarios
resulted in a net power generation of
nothing or at least nothing that I could
measure by plugging it into my dead
phone and measuring the resulting charge
keep in mind both of these guys doing
both of these things did it for at least
an hour there's no way it's not charged
at all I was literally running for an
hour
Jane it is not charging at all
so yeah didn't work wonderful
Mahalo I guess the little LED did light
up so there's that but that's it that
seemed odd because you hold it in your
hand and you know like jacket for a
little while it works
the little LED lights up and you can
actually get some charge onto your phone
if you can go long enough we got a
little flash that was it
that's where Linus came in I secretly
hate him so I sent him out for a jog for
an entire hour with the specific
instruction that he needed to keep a lot
of bounce in his step in order to shake
the ante he came back exhausted which
was funny and covered in sweat which was
less funny when I had to actually take
the am pee from him then the LED light
lit up hmm I plugged into my phone and
it started to charge I genuinely got
really excited here Linus had to suffer
and the amp II was actually going to
work now okay it's not all they claimed
it would be neither of the previous
benchmarks worked at all if we had used
the energy that it took to chill this
water I bumped it into this building for
me to consume it all while I ran the
charging phone okay there you go
but it's working now right right no not
really a minute or two into charging I
still hadn't gained a single percent and
it was starting to fail my phone seemed
confused as to whether or not it was
charging in just a few seconds after
that it was all over if you live in a
city you probably walk enough to extend
your phone's battery life by three hours
if you also go on a run or maybe go
cycling you can extend it by six hours
the more you move the more power you get
so big surprise it doesn't actually work
now let's address their claims one hour
of exercise equals five hours of
smartphone battery life right well if
you flip the box over it's a bit of a
different story
now it's stating five hours of standby
battery life but okay
okay what about the powers one full
smartphone thing there can't be any
clever wording there right let's based
off an iPhone 5c of all things the
battery listed on the box is only 1600
milliamp hours however it does say on
their website that it's 1800 milliamp
hours whichever version of their
statements you decide to believe which
at this point should probably be neither
it's just over or just under one half of
my pixel xl's maximum charge that's
pathetic I mean you can just charge it
from the wall like any other freakin
battery bank but you shouldn't because
it's a terrible battery bank with an
embarrassing maximum charge for its size
and weight take these two batteries for
instance one from anchor and one from
cheer oh this one is 6700 milliamp hours
this one is 6,400 milliamp hours if you
put them together they're actually just
ever so slightly larger than the MP yet
with a combined maximum charge of over
seven times more at 13100 milliamp hours
just buy a normal battery bank so what
happened to all that special tech that
it took three engineering PhDs from
Northwestern to develop let's find out
by tearing the ampie apart
wait so it's a magnet in an inductor I
mean I'm not that great at physics but
you start learning this in grade like 11
or 12 don't you
very impressive guys very impressive now
I'm not saying that the principle of
operation here can't be useful in
certain situations it's a very cool idea
just the implementation is nasty and
deplorable as far as I can tell they saw
an advertisement on TV at like 2:00 a.m.
advertising a flashlight that works when
you shake it and had a sudden revelation
of oh my god if we just replace the
capacitor that's in the end of there
with a battery we can store the charge
longer brilliant absolutely brilliant I
love it it's fantastic great idea
speaking of brilliant John suggested a
wonderful Kickstarter idea to me let's
install water wheels in toilets and
urinals so people can charge their
devices while they take a piss
we should start a Kickstarter anyways
the ideas aside what's their future well
no news yet and hopefully it stays that
way for the sake of their potential
future customers looking at the comments
from their current ones on Kickstarter
reveals an impressive and inspiring
amount of anger I speak for you and
again just like last time this product
wasn't exactly just release but they're
still trying to sell it so I thought I'd
try to alert people before they try to
flush their money down their toilet
alongside their water we love power
generation
