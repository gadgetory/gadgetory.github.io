video today because I have wanted to
show you guys my new toy
for well man I guess it's it's been a
few days now since it arrived in the
mail and I've spent some time playing
with it and it is the product that I
alluded to in my iPhone 10's video from
last night and it is my brand new switch
and then actually also something else
that just arrived today that is closely
related to it so a lot of you guys
complained about the audio in our video
last night saying that it was really bad
and it's funny cuz like sometimes it's
hard but other times it's really easy
for me to tell who didn't watch the
video and this was one of those cases
where it was pretty easy to tell who
didn't watch the video because only
people who didn't watch past about the
first minute would have thought that the
audio was bad for the entire thing
because the reason we had a bunch of
background noise was that I had this
commercial-grade network switch running
here in the office with me while I was
delivering the the lines about sort of
the video that I'd rather be making
instead of doing the one about the
iPhone 10s and a lot of you said in the
comments vault
come on - I would have rather seen a
video about that switch than the iPhone
10s so today I will be obliging you the
reason that we got one of these so this
is a used del s 40 48 T - om this is a
commercial-grade network switch it is a
48 port so you guys can check out the
back here this is a 48 port 10 gigabit
switch and the reason that we're
upgrading to it from our net year 28
port and our net year 12 port there you
go
it only gets super loud like that during
the boot up process is that we have
gotten to the point where we're running
out of ten gig ports when we first went
ten gig we got a 12 port switch thinking
that was enough forever you know I would
hook up my workstation we'd shrunk to
ten gig connections to our main editing
server we'd have one 10 gig connection
for another editing server and then we'd
have our team of six at most video
editors all wired in for 10 gig and then
we'd have a couple extra ports left over
just in case we needed them and then we
were like okay now we ran out and we got
a bunch of servers now we've got the
petabyte project and all that so I was
like ok screw it let's just get there 28
port will get there bigger one and now
it's getting to the point where even
people like the writers want 10 gig
networking so that they can look at raw
footage because you guys got to
understand those red files when you're
just playing them back and trying to
scrub through them you can see 3 4
gigabit per second on your on your task
manager network monitor like they really
need more than a gigabit connection in
order to reveal them and in some cases
especially with something like a crazy
project like the the flying PC it is
necessary for the writer to go back and
scrub through all the footage before it
even goes to the editor so they can
figure out exactly what is the narrative
here where do we need some voiceover and
all that kind of stuff so we've gotten
to the point where pretty much everyone
in the building either needs or at least
strongly wants to have 10 gig networking
and remember it's more than just what we
have hooked up in any given moment for a
project we're actually working on
there's also the component of like
whatever we're testing so let's say for
example I was working on oh yeah the Meg
store shoot I think we actually just
took that out of here but um I had a
funder bolt tape deck so it's a
Thunderbolt 3 tape drive machine that in
order to test the maximum speeds of I
needed to have a 10 gig network
connection to one of our servers in
order to copy files onto it because I
wanted to know well I wanted to evaluate
it
as a feasible way for us to archive our
footage and obviously anything that
we're archiving would be coming off of
our network and then Jake was actually
recently working on a project where he
was running ten sorry ten 100 gigabit
links between two machines now that was
just a cable like a machine to machine
direct-attached copper cable but he
still needed to be able to grab large
test files off of our servers and it's
nice to wait one tenth the amount of
time rather than you know sitting around
for gigabit to chug so anyway I was
inspired to get a 10 gigabit switch so
that we can get every port in the office
on 10 gig for those reasons and also
because we talked about this on LAN show
but we're gonna be getting a significant
oh I am so excited we're gonna be
getting a significant upgrade to our
internet connection here and it's more
than just a speed boost so we already
have a gigabit symmetric fiber internet
connection but it's switched fibre which
basically means that once they once some
request goes out of our office it
actually goes through multiple network
switches before it ever reaches some are
like a major internet exchange where
where it's like where things get really
fast ok so the connection we're getting
now is not only gonna be five point five
gigabit so over five times the speed we
are actually leasing dedicated a
dedicated wavelength within the fiber so
what that means is there is effectively
no switching between us and the
Vancouver internet exchange Vanek's so
this has a couple of effects number one
is it means that we will have basically
the highest-quality connection possible
because we aren't sharing our wavelength
with anybody and number two because our
ISP is super dope and I don't throw the
word dope around lightly because our ISP
is flippin awesome
even though we're only paying for a five
point five gigabit internet connection
we will actually have full 10 gigabit to
anyone else out of anacs which includes
Amazon Google Akamai so for a lot of the
services on the internet especially the
bandwidth heavy ones we're gonna have
effectively ten gigabit internet sorry
sorry I got you David sorry sorry dude
so ten gigabit internet so now there's
actually a compelling reason for any one
of our workstations to have a ten
gigabit network connection cuz we're
gonna have a 10 gig pipe to the Internet
anyway other specs of this thing that
might be interesting to you guys come
check this up so we've got our 48 10 gig
ports here and what it was a total
switching capacity of this thing it's a
1.4 for terabit per second and it is
rated for 3 micro seconds of latency at
full load I tell you that date three
microseconds of latency is monitoring
the stream audio he's a little behind us
and this is cool over here these queue
sfp+ ports are all 40 gigabit ports so
if what we wanted to do was let's say we
wanted a high-speed connection over to
our land center we could just run one
fiber connection from our this would be
like our main switch this would be our
top of the rack switch so we would run a
single connection over to there and we'd
have effectively a 40 gigabit link
between that entire switch and this one
or if instead of bonding connections to
our main editing server our nvme server
if instead of bonding connections we
just wanted to run a single one we could
get a cheap like $50 direct attached
copper cable and run it from this down
to that editing server with just a few
hundred dollar network card and boom we
have a 40 gigabit connection which means
that if we had 4 editors that are
pulling footage off of it at the same
time there would be no bottleneck
whatsoever they could all get their full
10 game
the other thing that's really cool but
actually there's a bunch of stuff that's
really cool about this thing it was not
cheap to put it in perspective I could
have bought myself probably one each of
the new iPhones for what I paid for this
thing used but I mean them's the breaks
when you want to be on the cutting edge
right so there's some other pretty cool
stuff about this thing it's got hot
swappable fans check that out it freaks
out when one of them fails the whole
thing can be reconfigured either blowing
from front to back or back to front
depending on your rack configuration
which is pretty neat
it's also oh yeah so this is an exotic
I'll show you guys this in a minute it's
also got dual redundant 550 watt power
supplies so this is neat they're hot
swappable so if let's say one of them
failed outright the operation of the
switch is completely unaffected other
than just you would want to set up set
it up so that you get a warning or
something so you can come in pop a new
power supply in there and get back up
and running there we go let's just put
that back boom oh it's gone so yeah it's
got so this is you're supposed to use
like an adapter cable mine's youth so it
didn't come with it
so you would adapt this to I think it's
serial then you can interface with the
the command-line interface of the switch
that way or it's got an Ethernet
management port or the one that I've
actually tinkered with so far as this is
funny I'd never seen this before that is
a micro USB port on the front of the
switch so what you do is you open up
here hold on here we go there we go
so you open up a program like putty get
it all configured I think with the USB
to serial driver I have on here I think
it's con six and I think Oh hold on
shoot I don't know if I have the
settings configured right serial come
six hurry oh yeah I might have to reboot
it in order for this to show up and I
also might have to change some
the settings here yes it depends it's
different from switch to switch and I
might have had the wrong thing up just
now but anyway that's actually how you
interface with it so it's all
command-line until and this is another
cool feature of this thing and like
super stoked on it until you install a
third-party OS with a web UI if you're
into that sort of thing now I want to
open this puppy up Jake I'm not
convinced this is faster I think I could
go faster with a manual ok you know what
very everyone saw how long it took to
get those five out fine let's race hold
on let's see who can get 5 out I'll do
this five you do this 5 ok Ready Set oh
damn it get it
oh my friends you are seeing the world's
first screwdriver race championship okay
I was pretty close to top that one all
right technically I dropped a screw and
you didn't or did you oh wow that was
that was after that one and I got a
couple more to pull out here actually
actually do you mind pulling out the
ones on the side thank you I think the
main takeaway here is that two heads are
better than one or many hands make light
work or whatever I'm sure there's
something that my you know grandma told
me all the time that's applicable here
actually that's a pretty good idea I
don't think I have one in my office
right now
thank you all right so what exactly is
it that would make a network switch
worth thousands of dollars that I mean
in terms of the grade of hardware that's
inside this thing this is basically a
full-blown 1u server other than that
it's just highly specialized so this guy
right here appears to be an M SATA SSD
so it actually uses an SSD for its local
storage go figure right this right here
I already pop this out if you guys
follow on Instagram or Twitter or
whatever you would have seen that this
is a four gig ECC memory module so I am
really curious to see what effect if any
I would get out of upgrading it because
I'm pretty sure we have some eight ECC
memory lying around somewhere in the
office right here let's see I think she
so I wasn't able to get these heatsinks
off it seems as though they are
basically glued in place in addition to
the screws and I did get this one off
but the chip inside there is actually
marked so I wasn't able to tell you too
much else about it other than just that
this thing is flipping fast
it requires substantial cooling like
these fans move
mondo airflow and these heat things are
beefy AF like check out how thick these
things are can you see that David and
naturally all of this is just half of
the story today so we can go ahead and
shut down the switch now in order to oh
shoot I had I'll forget it switching
ASIC you think it might so I suspect
this one's actually the controller
because it's near the memory on the
storage I think this is probably the
switching ASIC so Asics are for more
than just mining even though in the in
the climate of the last you know couple
of years that's probably the context
that the average sort of semi techie
person has heard about them in but Asics
can be used for all kinds of things just
any specialized repetitive application
where you don't need a general-purpose
processor often you can do it more
efficiently both from a cost of hardware
standpoint and from an energy standpoint
if you use an ASIC a purpose-built chips
or what's that verges super chats
oh-oh-oh yeah you can you can you can
tell me one while I get to the next
exciting part of today's unboxing no
actually I didn't check if it has
already ma that is a fantastic question
right now I don't think any of the
network adapters that we're using have
our DMA support anyway we do have those
Mellanox ones that we're going to be
using for the 100 gigabit project but
that's something that we haven't
actually looked into actually deploying
yet so a good question wish I had a
solid answer for you but unfortunately I
don't yet now I'm not a
command-line wizard as those of you
who've been watching shut up Jake as
those of you who have been watching for
a long time probably know so honestly
the furthest I've gotten to the switch
so far is just teaching myself some of
the basics in order to hopefully get
myself to the point where I can install
a web UI because networking isn't my
forte in the first place so command-line
is definitely not my preferred means of
interfacing with hardware
yeah just questions is good but you can
filter them according to your judgment
yeah just hit me with a good question
here can you just really that's not a
good question can you sing something
something something something I don't
know any of the words but I think I
could probably do the melody yeah I
think it's also in Spanish and I don't
speak any Spanish so that makes it
really challenging for me to-- when i
can't find the words to say - okay I
think that's probably enough of that
painful that was that was really that
was really hard for me to listen to and
I was the one - he hit me with another
one okay
finding your channel got me interested
in tech again also lol the shirt yeah so
this shirt was definitely a James idea
he well actually I think it was kind of
a team effort Jake really wanted to do
an RT X on shirt and then James's
contribution was the arrow and then it
was kind of one of those it was one of
what what happened I thought you were
the arrow no my the person wearing it
was the thing that was on so then I said
what about an arrow I think Nixon an
arrow pointing up and I said what going
to arrow pointing down and that's the
moment that is good yeah okay well I
didn't remember exactly how it happened
but at least I credited the right person
so I'm doing pretty well here anyway
oh okay you don't know I wanna I wanna I
want to talk about this thing so this is
a Super Micro 50:19 DF and eight
TP and these guys really need to start
using like cooler names for their
products because super micro makes some
pretty amazed balls stuff and it's
always called like a button they should
just call this like like the crunch
inator
because this is gonna be the new router
that we are going to pair to our switch
and I don't mean like pair strictly
speaking you don't you don't like para
router in a switch it's just gonna be
the router that we're running and then
this is gonna be our new top-of-rack
switch and I just realized I I never
showed you guys a cue SFP+ cable so this
is not your mama's network cable but
this is what we're gonna want to run for
10 or excuse me for 40 gigabit speeds so
you'll get a card that also runs that
connector you plug it in like that and
then they've got these handy-dandy
release mechanisms here and then this is
relatively inexpensive so it's
direct-attached copper and these are
these nice thick copper cables but even
with beefy cables like this you can only
go so far at those kinds of speeds with
the technology we have today so if you
want to go any further than you need to
get fiber modules and then you need to
run fiber and it's the whole it's the
whole thing we won't be running fiber
from the main network room over to the
servers and the others just there's no
real reason for it because what we're
gonna be doing is like gaming which
doesn't is not going to benefit on a LAN
from fiber and it would just add
additional expense you got to protect
the fiber runs with like like armor like
something like it's just it's just not
worth it anyway what's cool about this
guy is that this is basically just a
computer it's just a server but they
designed it to be kind of purpose-built
for routing applications like kind of so
only one power supply yeah I was
actually I was kind of surprised and a
little disappointed to see that that I
mean I guess and the odds of it failing
are pretty slim but I don't I don't
really like the so what we'll probably
end up doing is the same thing that
we've been doing now I actually had a
few people ask me
when we did our last tour of the server
room why we had two of those ubiquity
routers in there and the reason is that
we just had another one configured
identically as as a manual failover so
just we just grabbed all the cables that
are plugged into the existing one power
up the new one put them in exactly the
same spot and bippity boop it's off to
the races
so it's possible we'll end up doing
something similar to that but we get to
it yeah I was actually kind of thinking
we would do that so casual unboxing says
longtime listener first-time caller love
your show learned a lot over the years
here's a show of support oh thank you
very much for that oh that was hard to
listen to I'm gonna grab a bigger bit oh
I'm sorry
Wow brand new brand new machine here
alright so let's talk some some basic
speeds and feeds of this guy like a lot
of Super micros gear this is a
bare-bones box so it doesn't actually
have RAM or storage in it so it's just a
case motherboard power supply in most
cases for bare-bones
but even though this is running a Xeon
processor it's the type of Xeon that
most people probably won't be familiar
with so after the over the last couple
of years
Intel Haswell the entire industry has
moved away from having motherboards with
sockets and then CPUs that fit in the
sockets as just the exclusive way of
putting CPUs onto motherboards and a lot
of the time you'll find soldered
processors not just on laptops but even
on things like servers so this is a xeon
d which is more like an SOC than it is
like a cpu like obviously there's a cpu
component to it but this bare-bones
also includes a processor so it's a xeon
d and i'm gonna struggle with the exact
numbers of the model's letters nothing
whatever but anyway it's a an 8 core 16
thread processor it's 80 watts
of its are sorry it's rated at 80 watts
of total power consumption under low TDP
I hate I hate doing things live for this
very reason so it's got an 80 watt TDP
but the most important feature that it
has for us is actually one called oh
crap my stupid computer just locked and
I had some of the notes that I needed
for this video open on it so I'm just
gonna go ahead and open that up yeah
thank you
8 416 thread right so the feature we
really need is one called quick assist
technology now there's a little brother
to this guy this is about $1,600 which I
know that sounds like a lot of money but
in the context of an internet router
that can handle a 10 gigabit internet
connection actually a value that's like
that's like the that's like the cheapo
DIY one because we're gonna be running
PS cents on this thing but it also has a
little brother that has a 4 core rather
than an 8 core processor that doesn't
have this quick assist technology but
that would also be suitable as long as
we aren't too picky about our encryption
performance so the thing that led me to
this one in particular was actually a
couple of articles I was reading over on
serve the home that is a fantastic
website by the way if you're looking at
getting into networking network storage
really basically because I don't I I the
only thing I don't like about them is
the name because serve the home makes it
sound like it's gonna be just
consumer-grade stuff like Synology nas
or whatever but it's not at all
they do everything from that all the way
to the top of the line it's it's really
cool they do a fantastic job they're the
only ones in the space I think that are
really doing it justice right now but
anyway the reason that we care about
that is that if we want to use IPSec VPN
tunneling this has hardware acceleration
for it that that quad core version
doesn't so that's the real trick so
right now with our ubiquity router we're
able to get gigabit internet no problem
but because it doesn't have hardware
acceleration for the type of VPN that
we're running I can only get somewhere
in the neighborhood of three to five
megabytes a second transfer speed so
that's 30 to 50 megabit that sucks now
there are ways I could optimize it but I
think I'm still gonna be limited to
probably about 3 to 5 X that which
obviously for running a 10 gigabit
internet connection is not going to be
suitable so we wanted to make sure that
we're upgrading the rest of our
infrastructure at the same time in order
to keep pace with this guy I don't think
we're going to be able to do 10 gigabit
but what I would like to see is in
excess of one gigabit so Telus tells me
that I'm gonna have one gig coming to my
neighborhood sometime in the future so I
would love to be able to have direct
access to our servers at work at one gig
securely that's kind of the goal of of
this upgrade here so we can I mean we
can have a closer look at the rest of
the hardware and here if you guys would
like so we've got a I'm just reading
this off the thing at this point but 200
watt 80 plus gold power supply alrighty
then it's not immediately apparent to me
who the OEM is but it's super mikro
built generally speaking we haven't had
any issues with their stuff in the last
little while so I'm not gonna complain
about it we've got a couple of those
same type of cooling fans that we
actually saw on our switch so there's
super thick but really small 40
millimeter cooling fans these things
move a freaking ton of air so you can
tell right now this thing is configured
for front to back air flow what I
actually suspect is that we could flip
it around without too much difficulty
here it looks like these could just be
popped out and then popped back in the
other way they're just on these little
rubber mounts here and I still haven't
decided exactly how I want them
configured I may want them to be back to
front in which case I'd actually have to
order some replacement power supplies
for the Dell I tried it and it actually
won't boot up if you or not I tried it
sorry I was reading about it and didn't
try this particular thing but it looks
like it won't boot up if you have some
back to front and some front to back
look if your power supplies don't match
your your chassis fans so well I don't
know how it knows or maybe it was just
that they didn't recommend it but I'll
see if I can figure that out but if I
have these on the back of
Rach it's possible that I'll want them
sucking in from the back and blowing out
to the front all my existing switches
are side and taken exhaust so it hasn't
really been an issue but um I mean these
are just these are just little things to
solve pull pull that off put that back
in there how what do we got we got a
couple of two and a half inch drive
cages here I mean typically you wouldn't
need a ton of that the only reason I
could think of to use these would be if
I wanted to throw a couple low capacity
two and a half inch SSDs in here and
then just have them run RAID one in case
you know something failed you know we
don't want our our pfSense OS to not
boot up I've got a couple you dot two
connectors that's like madness so we
could run like high-speed nvme SSDs for
both of these that would be pretty
flippin sick we've got a couple of MDOT
two's so this is just a little that
looks like a forty millimeter one and
then right here is an 80 millimeter one
so that's kind of the industry standard
we've got what looks like mini PCIe if
you wanted to throw like a Wi-Fi card in
this thing for whatever reason you got a
full size PCIe 16x here I don't know
what purpose that serves because if
you're familiar with the 1u form factor
at all you probably know that it's not
very tall as far as I know this board is
specific for this system but you never
know maybe they have some kind of OEM
design that they do that they've they've
reused it for but basically the only one
you've got access to is this 8x and only
if you have a single slot card so what
you would want to use that for check
this out this is the front of the case
so this comes out the front so that
would be if you want to add probably
more networking capability or that quick
assist technology that's what it's
called right yeah quick assist
technology you can actually get
standalone cards for it too but I don't
know what their relationship is to the
ones that are built into the CPUs
themselves it's something that's been
evolving over the last five years or so
so this definitely requires more
research I just wanted to kind of share
this with you guys
well it's was hot and fresh before I get
it all built out oh it supports quad
channel memory that's the other key
difference between this one and the the
half is expensive one that one's a dual
channel so because you've got 8 cores 16
threads quad channel memory high-speed
storage connectivity you could actually
use this not just for internet routing
purposes because remember a lot of that
is going to be offloaded to the hardware
accelerated the hardware accelerated
cryptography cryptography hardware on
here so you could actually use this CPU
with virtualization for other tasks as
well if you were into that sort of thing
I don't think I'm gonna virtualize our
router I might I don't know I can't
really think of a benefit to it it
doesn't take up a ton of rack space so I
might not bother but feel free to let me
know in the comments on this video if
you think I'm totally wrong and we
should definitely run a hypervisor
overtop of PF sense I just I mean PF
sense is already at a slight
disadvantage compared to networking
specific hardware using x86 in terms of
latency I can't think of any reason to
add any more overhead to it but I maybe
I'm wrong um at the front sorry oh yeah
I'll get to it I'll get to it so here at
the front we've got an Intel i3 50 so
that's powering four gigabit connections
so this would be useful if we wanted to
have like separate I don't know like
separate VLANs or something like that if
we wanted to manage that directly off
the router so we would want to so
basically those are kind of like
separate virtual networks so they don't
have access to each other but then you
can create rules through your router to
allow like certain machines to talk to
others or certain types of traffic to
cross them so that's not why you might
want a bunch of one gig connections then
we've got a management port here this
will be for our k vm downstairs we've
got actually two more 10 gig Ethernet
ports so those are powered by what is it
there you go annex 557 Intel chipset and
then these two right here so these are
SFP+ these are 10 gig as well and these
are running directly off of the SOC so
that's what makes this an SOC rather
than a CPU it's got some more kinds of
esoteric features built into it that you
wouldn't normally find in just a
general-purpose central processor so why
don't we do a couple do you mind just
tilting this a little bit so I can I
can't
with the hood on it okay Matt jack says
that cabl be Fick yes thank you Matt
Jack the cable is indeed thick for those
of you who are just tuning in we were
looking at a fixed cable a little while
ago yep Camile notice me senpai yes I
have noticed you and our TX bait is so
Opie well I don't know what kind of
unboxing you guys were expecting to find
on youtube today
what what's an RT X yeah I mean either
oh guys Chat Chat Chat Chat oh who wore
it better yeah who wore it better who
wore our T X better oh I can't keep
pretending I don't know what RT X is PC
says out of curiosity how many if at all
LMG employees have a conte a plus
certification it's not a requirement I
guarantee you that probably a good third
of us could pass that kind of a
certification but it's as far as I know
I don't think anyone has an 800 Anthony
mate hey can you open the door hey
Anthony do you have your ne+ yeah okay
DEFCON ta oh that's the same thing yeah
I thought they were separate they're
mine oh that's right thank you
okay so Anthony is the only one who
knows anything about that and yes he
does have a plus so he actually worked
as like a computer technician before he
joined here he wasn't just like a weird
enthusiast but like really wanted to
make videos about technology Alexander
says why don't you build a homebrew ten
gigabit switching solution you know what
it's not impossible that we would ever
try to do something like that but as far
as I know the best performance still
comes from off-the-shelf switches so ya
can't can't say nothing like that would
ever happen oh boy he moved the thing
Adam says Linus you're awesome I'm a
doctor but I've always loved networking
you've taken my interest to a whole
other level that's cool
I mean really that's that's that's kind
of what we're all about here like
frankly our channel is not the place
where you're gonna find like the
detailed step
by step guide for how we configured this
thing once we've got it deployed for
that you're gonna want to go to like
level one tax or did somewhere else
please
but really you know what we're about is
just kind of sharing our love and
passion for technology and so if it gets
you interested enough that you want to
dig a little deeper with other resources
like level one tags they're gamers Nexus
or whatever else then we feel like our
missions accomplished a slider says
decided to become a data network
engineer after seeing your server room
vlogs see exactly like that you know
more about this stuff that slider 67
than I ever will I guarantee it if
you're already like doing that kind of
work and and I think I think that's
great
like I can't a lot of people get
frustrated when we make a video about
whether it's 3d printing or networking
and they say oh like you guys didn't go
deep enough for you you didn't get this
quite right or whatever the case may be
but the reality of it is we the tech is
so wide like it used to be we'd make a
video about something that wasn't a PC
and people would like lose their minds
what do you guys doing but tech is so
broad and the reality of it is even with
20 people here we can't be the deepest
subject-matter experts when it comes to
every single aspect of it but if we
inspire other people to dig deeper then
I think that's fantastic all right last
one
folk Johansen says how much is one
gigabit fiber connection over there oh
okay so it depends if you just want a
one gigabit residential connection I
suspect it'll be around too high things
around 160 bucks for a Telus pere fiber
one gigs think it's around that so
that's what I'll be paying at home our
fiber connection here is three thousand
dollars a month for one gig because we
have a 99.9 or double nine 99.99% uptime
guarantee with a service level agreement
so basically if our internet goes down
they start paying us is how that works
so it's business great Internet we also
have many more IPS than you get issued
with a standard residential connection
and there are a lot of reasons why you
might want more than one IP it's a
higher grade connection so even our
switched fiber here is better than what
you're get
at your home even if you have
fiber-to-the-home what are what are some
of the other reasons that it matters we
also have we have an allocation of space
in our ISPs data center and that's
something special that our our ISP did I
don't think we'd get something like that
through tell us directly and it's it's
all on Telesis backbone anyway so we're
getting the same effective service but
we're allowed to keep servers in their
database so we can do off-site backups
there what else do we get for our $3,000
a month we get amazing customer service
I can literally okay I don't want to
oversell them because I don't think
everybody gets exactly the same
treatment and to be clear it's not
because they knew who we were they were
great to us before they even knew what -
tech tips was in particular their CTO is
amazing like I can call him at 2:00 in
the morning which i think is 3:00 in the
morning his time and he's just like what
up what up
oh is it this one is this shirt life do
you want you want to check okay so
anyway the five-and-a-half gigabit
connection is gonna be about yeah it's
gonna be more it is it's up oh you guys
can buy this shirt now if you want
apparently it's up on the design DBH
store I think is it merged on Linus tech
tips comm I feel like here hold on I can
I can check I can check that Lloyd yeah
merge start line is tech tips comm
you'll find it there it's the one on the
bottom right Artie axon with the we move
the arrow bit so should be noted that
this is like a cheap mock-up so if you
look closely at it this is just like
like a vinyl iron-on like garbage town
print but we also adjusted some things
so I thought that the nipple instead of
being like way up here should probably
be more like here so we move this up a
bit and I think the arrow is not gonna
be quite so long because you can see it
kind of gets scrunched up and lost in
the bottom of the shirt so we made a
couple of changes but yeah this shirt
design is apparently live so there you
go this video is brought to you by LTT
merch check out the link in the video
description which isn't there right now
what should be there later
by yeah Jake dicks gonna put it there
now uses lame see mines like mines got
dick jokes that makes it better okay you
can in the stream anytime now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
