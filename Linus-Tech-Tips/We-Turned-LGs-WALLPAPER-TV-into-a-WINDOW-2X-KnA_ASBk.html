could use the LG Signature Series OLED
wallpaper TV to make a window - anywhere
- the realization of one of the coolest
projects that we've ever done well in my
case you asked your wife to do it
no one externally seems to have any idea
what Yvonne actually does here but
coordinating random design and
construction projects including our most
recent set upgrade has been a much
larger part of her role than anyone
including her probably expected and
that's not always an easy thing to deal
with let us ask me to help with this
project and gave me zero instructions
for what to do and how to film this or
anything beyond make it cool and modern
and have a window but like the windows a
TV I confess I was pretty hands-off on
this one but let's face it if I was in
charge we all know how it would end up
looking so Yvonne brought in carpenter
and super nice guy Jorge to lend us his
woodworking expertise and after much
debate the decision was made that in
order to make the TV as easy to remove
as possible what we were going to do was
attached it to an MDF backing with the
factory mount then slide the whole thing
into a hollowed out cavity using the
window casing to hold it in so step one
go get the TV from the a roll set we
mangled the flat magnetic wall mount a
little bit by over tightening it last
time but we managed to stretch it out on
our MDF getting it nice and flat led us
to say George menze to stretch it out on
the MDF my attempt to screw it on was so
crooked we had to completely redo it
then we mounted the TV to it not
entirely without mishap trace the
outline to get the exact dimensions for
our window and finally cut it out with a
circular saw a table saw might have been
a bit better but with a steady hand this
should do the trick
throughout this process Yvonne was
working on the design aspects of the
office upgrade removing the mouse wall
clock and Linus media group sign and
puttying over the incredible amount of
damage that the construction glue did to
the drywall next up cut out the hole
there is a little bit of room for error
here
because we'll be adding a frame to make
the window effect more can
Singh but if our drywall cutout isn't
truly square we'll end up covering part
of the screen in the corners so if there
was ever a time for measure twice cut
once this is it next some angle grinder
tips from George followed by twisting
out the rest of the metal studs before
measuring cutting and adding wood
framing on all four sides to friction
mount the TV's backing so much for that
work that we just did filling in this
wall a few weeks ago now everything up
until now has been done sort of on faith
that it's gonna work if the MDF backing
or the hole in the wall haven't been cut
perfectly or the flat ribbon cable on
the back of the TV doesn't line up with
our pass-through hole to carry it down
to the hidden speaker bar below we could
be looking at hours of cleanup all
perfect fit and it's good now obviously
we wouldn't trust just friction on the
backplate to hold the TV in place I mean
come on what is this channel where we
drop things meet the 100 hour silent
Edition which it's more like a portable
so the next step was to create a frame
for the TV that's meant to be both
aesthetic giving our recessed TV a more
window like appearance and functional
since it's foam backed so it can sit
right up snug against the glass and it
fits much tighter to hold the whole
thing in after a few tests fits it got a
coat of black paint better to do that
now rather than risk getting paint on
the TV while cutting around its fine
details now it's time to put the TV on
it's MDF carrier for the last time
some tuck tape pull tabs here should
help us get the panel out in the future
if we ever decide to tear the window out
and relocate it while mounting the TV we
needed to be extra careful with the
fragile flat ribbon cable a task made
especially difficult by the extension
that we planned to use to hide the
speaker bar away under the built-in desk
time now then for some putty touch-ups
and the final fitting of the black frame
this is actually when I saw it for the
first time and I immediately wondered
how exactly we were gonna hook up the
speaker bar which also happens to have
all of the inputs and outputs for the W
series OLED but I was assured there was
a plan for cutting out some of the
drywall and fishing it out
they just apparently needed someone with
really really small fingers to actually
do it yes it's true moment of truth time
having survived a drop some bending and
the last couple of days in a
construction zone would the TV still
work yes
now the second goal of this project was
to make the workspace match the hyper
modern design of having a super thin TV
as your window so it was time then for a
custom built-in desk with a
purpose-built holder for the speaker bar
underneath with a little bit of trial
and error we managed to deal with the
awkward length extension giving us a
comb
completely clean look without
restricting our access to IO here's how
I kind of envision using the new set up
a couple shelves some cable pass
throughs and some paint and we're
getting pretty close to finished but
between paint drying times and waiting
for a few small items not least of which
is some sexy brand and footage to play
in the window
Brandon sexy footage not cool
we're out of stuff that we can do for
right now so stay tuned for part three
which is going to be the glammed up tour
of the finished ultimate productivity
setup so thanks for watching guys and
