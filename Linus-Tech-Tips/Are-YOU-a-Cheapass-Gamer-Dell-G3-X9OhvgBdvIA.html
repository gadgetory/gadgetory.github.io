choose can say a lot about you as an
individual some are a fashion statement
like the surface laptop with its deeply
colored aluminum finish and matching
Alcantara wrist rest others are
utilitarian for the no-nonsense business
oriented professional crowd while still
others are as far as we can tell pretty
much pure displays of excess and wealth
as for this one over here the Dell g3
what kind of person would own one of
these by the look of things
the rugged type of person the kind of
person who has made some compromises in
the pursuit of price to performance but
has the trade-off been worth it for him
and his fellow g3 years will join us as
we take a look at a day in the life of a
Dell g3 owner
looking for an affordable and reliable
VPN private Internet access encrypts
your Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP check it out today through
the link below waking up at the crack of
10 o'clock
except for Tuesday's because of that one
8 a.m. math class the del g3 owner
spills out of bed and gets cleaned up he
makes an attempt at grooming himself
before finally after 30 painstaking
seconds opting for a hat
his muscles ripple as his 5 plus pounds
of laptop get stashed into his backpack
for transportation followed by his 1.3
pound power brick thanks to the g3 is
just over 4 and a half hours in our
battery life test this second part is a
requirement here the del g3 and its
owner are on their home turf a quick
gaming session during an early break
period compared to other gaming laptops
it lacks some flash but the owner is
quick to point out how wise he was to
forego RGB for more performance since at
850 dollars
the g3 competes with much more expensive
models getting into the game takes a
little longer just a hundred and twenty
eight gigs of solid-state storage for
the OS and some applications means that
most games will sit on the one terabyte
of molasses low 5400 rpm hard drive but
once it hits the battlefield the g3
keeps up admirably
once again housing a quad-core intel
core i5 eight gigs of ram and an nvidia
1050 Ti even modern triple-a games can
touch the top frame rate that can be
displayed by its 60 Hertz 1080p monitor
al biet with some sacrifices many
in-game details will have to be dropped
to medium or low when break time is
almost over and it's time to start a
last-minute render or video export the
g3 CPU will thermal throttle briefly
dropping down from its max 4 gigahertz
turbo it will increase its fan speed to
a higher performance but still audibly
comfortable level then it settles in at
about 3.3 gigahertz with temperatures in
the 75 to 80 degree range
but now the g3 and its owner must be
removed from their comfort zone to a
teacher assigned study group
producing the Dell g3 here does not draw
the attention of potential mates with
their gaze passing by its plastic
exterior and large bezels to rivals with
harder slimmer chassis made of exotic
materials like carbon fiber but wait one
needs help with homework here the g3
keeps up and even sets itself apart the
wide viewing angles afforded by its IPS
display help when multiple people want
to share an Excel document naturally
taken on by the g3 with its greater
processing power and dedicated numberpad
and while others are donning dongles the
g3 maintains an old-school approach with
a healthy endowment of three USB
Taipei's and a full-sized HDMI connector
though it becomes confused when
presented with the increasingly common
type C device its owner having not
shelled out for the optional thunderbolt
upgrade the subpar trackpad causes it to
stumble while navigating the worksheet
however making a little rattling noise
every time it gets tapped and when it
comes time to beautify the assignment in
Photoshop a competitor takes command
with its more vibrant and color accurate
display returning home the owner takes a
short break with some quality YouTube
content without headphones the speakers
of the g3 delivering a solid enough
sound for casual listening then he
begins work typing up that short story
for his stupid creative writing elective
it's due tomorrow but he gets up to his
full typing speed quickly thanks to the
g3 s decent keyboard the softer but
still tactile keystrokes make for a
mostly good experience but he is
occasionally frustrated by a missed
stroke due to the g3 s mediocre key
stabilization
once the story has been polished to a
good enough standard the owner heads to
bed
dreaming of the day that he might crack
the g3 open to upgrade the RAM or toss
in a larger and Vimy Drive arriving at
the morning gaming session the next day
something is different a new laptop has
disrupted the natural power dynamic an
Acer nitro 5 oh well mine was just 850
bucks remarks the g3 owner but his usual
defense is useless the nitro 5 was $50
less so they trade blows a slightly
stiffer chassis on the Dell a better
track pad on the nitro more storage in
the hard drive of the Dell but type-c
compatibility by default on the nitro
the Dell has a more subdued appearance
while the nitro 5 goes for a more
traditional daily look in the end both
are worthy competitors and earn a
recommendation from us if you're looking
for GPU performance per dollar in a
laptop but the g3 is still deserving of
some criticism the price and performance
of the Dell g3 is slightly better than
the last 10 in sprin gaming but it
doesn't feel like it's worthy of being
called next-gen the biggest problem for
us is that the g3 looks like a three
year old computer the build quality is
the same if not worse the i/o is old
school and with Acer making big
improvements to the budget gaming
segment the Dell g3 is only just getting
a recommendation from us at this point
we're probably still gonna say to go
with whichever one is on sale but bill
will probably have to make some bigger
improvements next time around if they
want to keep up with Acer's fresher
