West 2016 this year check out their
length video description down below to
see the Razer Blade stealth
welcome to the EVGA booth where we're
checking out the DG 87 this case tries
to mix things up a bit instead of the
front being right here where we're used
to it being the front is here which is
normally referred to as the left hand
side so remember throughout this video
when I'm referring to the front that's
right here now for i/o on the front we
have two USB 3.0 ports headphone and
microphone jacks an HDMI pass-through
which you can plug into your graphics
card a USB type-c 3.1 connector a reset
button ache a boost precision OC button
which will overclock your graphics card
and CPU using precision and a power
button which is actually noted by the
EVGA logo also on the front of the case
there's a little display for your fan
controller which has a mode button the
mode button will change between
temperature intake fans and exhaust fans
and then depending on what mode you're
in the functionality of the arrow keys
will change so if you're an exhaust or
intake fan mode you can change the power
going to the fans from five percent all
the way up to a hundred percent now the
windowed side panel can be removed by
pressing in on this lever and then if
you want to fully take it off because
you want to work on the build and just
don't want to worry about it for a
little while you can press this lever in
and then pull the rail down although I'm
not going to do it right now because it
would fall out and I don't have two
hands to catch it the left hand side of
the computer is where you can access
your motherboard i/o so you do that by
pressing down the opposite lever for
opening the door and then what is
revealed here as well is to individual
120 or 140 millimeter fan slots you
cannot without some type of modding
remove this panel and join them together
and even if you did the spacing would be
incorrect for a dual read but you could
install a 120 or 140 millimeter radiator
here for your CPU removing the grille on
the right hand side of the computer can
be done by pressing in until you hear an
audible click letting go and then
pulling the fan filter away which can
also be removed just by sliding it down
now this is compatible with up to 4 by
120 millimeter fan radiator or a 3 by
140 millimeter fan radiator the back of
the case reveals the cable routing for
your motherboard and expansion card
slots and then if you pull up on this
lever you can reveal the back of the
motherboard tray where we can see large
cutout for mounting CPU coolers for
different SSD trays which can hold one
SSD each and then two Bay's of three by
three and a half inch drive trays and
then two individual spots for three and
a half inch drives as well now the cable
management that is currently displayed
back here is really not that great but
I'd take that with a grain of salt there
are quite a few different places where
you can manage your cables including pre
included loops which can easily route
things around this just seems to be
fairly hastily done like look at this
SATA cable thing what were you even
doing there are also a ton of cable
management rubber grommets which are
actually easier to see through the
backside due to some obscurities through
the front of the case but should make
your cables nice and pretty they're
really soft so shouldn't look too weird
when you run cables through them a
couple additional things to note
basically everything has filters on it
the right-hand side the left-hand side
the top even the power supply which I'll
remove and show you right here but it
should be noted that the top is a little
bit difficult to access you have to
remove the fans that are on the inside
and remove all the side panels and
everything in order to get to that
filter another thing to note is that
while we're showing off the DGA t7 right
now there are actually four models
there's the DG 87 DG 86 DG 85 and DG 84
and then the DG 84 is the most
significant difference having no window
here and no fan controller or display
down on the front as well although that
is all the way down to 149 dollars
compared to the 229 of this unit we're
looking at right now
we also checked out the EVGA power link
which is an aesthetic accessory for EVGA
10 70s or 10 80s which makes your power
routing look really cool essentially you
can plug the power supply cables into it
instead of the graphics card which
should remove some cable clutter from
the nicely viewable part of your case
what do you guys think let me know in
the comments down below also thank you
to Razer for sending us to PAX West 2016
this year took at the link in video
description down below to enter a
giveaway for the new razor blade which
is configured by me also the new razor
blade stealth which is configured by me
as well and then has some really
Oh custom art on it from Ed's ejogo so
check that out video description down
below Thank You Razer for sending us
here stay subscribed Alliance actives
for all of our packs OS 2016 content and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
