perfect headphones I'm talking perfect
in every way except the cords too short
or the headband digs in or the dank bass
drops are more like dank basements there
are so many things that can go wrong
that it's impossible to find a set
that's 100% flawless until now meet the
tma-2
modular headphone system from III the
headphone maker that lets you have it
your way
the master Keys Pro keyboard lineup from
cooler master is available in three
sizes each in white or RGB flavours
check them out at the link below for
their tma-2 S III has atomized their
headphones into four constituent parts
headbands speaker units ear pads and
cables allowing you Fioretti CLE to mix
and match to perfectly suit your needs
and your budget every part in the lineup
is compatible with every other one and
they all have this understated
postmodern aesthetic that you probably
won't be surprised to learn came out of
northern Europe these headphones are
straight-up a lot cooler than I am and
their website is pretty cool too and
refreshingly well designed which is
pretty important since it's all you'll
have to go on you can't just go to the
local Best Buy and try every combination
so not only does it let you browse the
various parts available in each category
it also offers several paths to choosing
a suitable assemblage you can dive right
in with their nifty configurator tool or
sync up your Spotify account to get a
suggested config based on the music you
listen to or you can just pick one of
the presets that III has designed I
think one
the best parts of working on this review
was actually the assembly it was kind of
like getting a new kid of Lego when I
was a kid the components come
individually bagged and putting them
together is not only super easy but it's
actually kind of fun the pieces snap
together with plastic clips and sliders
but I want to be clear that yes they're
plastic but I really don't get a sense
that they had to compromise a whole lot
on build quality in order to achieve
their modularity goals the soft touch
mat black components feel great and the
headband size is adjust with a very
satisfying click so III sent us almost
every flavor of each of the four parts
so we've got ear pads with microfiber
faux leather or velour padding cord
combinations from short to long to
straight to curly - with or without
inline controls and microphones we've
got 40 millimeter dynamic driver speaker
units with all manner of different
magnets diaphragms and venting and we've
got a selection of slim or padded
headbands almost the only thing they
didn't include is their upcoming
wireless Bluetooth headband
so then with enough parts to reconstruct
all of III's preset bundles we set out
to do just that from the $145 all
arounds to the 260 dollar tone Meister's
every pair is subjectively very stylish
with no tacky brand logos visible and
the only interruption to the clean matte
black looks being an optional splash of
color on the cord they're all
lightweight and comfortable and I even
prefer the long-term feeling of the over
ear tma-2 configurations to that of the
Sennheiser Momentum's and headband
caliper pressure is snug of course a
little higher on the on your configs
like the DJ preset the ear pads are free
to articulate a bit and you can plug the
cord into whichever side you prefer nice
but how
do they sound well as you might expect
that depends heavily on your personal
configuration particularly the speaker
units and ear pads so we're used to
seeing headphone product descriptions
full of marketing buzzwords and
audiophile lingo and while the ìiî
site is guilty of that to a degree what
I will say is this the tma-2
descriptions do contain some meaningful
information some speaker units have
punchier base and some ear pads as
advertised do create a wider soundstage
but the summary I guess then is this all
the configurations we tested sounded
what I would describe as pretty solid at
their respective price points though I
would actually recommend avoiding the
entry-level so1 speaker units as they
were the only ones that stood out as
being overly bright forward and kind of
baseless thankfully so2 are only twenty
five bucks more and spending more does
continue to get you a more natural sound
but it should be noted I don't want this
to come across as a suggestion that you
just buy the most expensive
configuration because that might not be
the one that you personally like best
which brings us to the big question then
modular headphones like the tma-2 do
they make sense compared to a comparably
priced conventional set definitely they
sound good and you're not paying a
premium for the modularity III's
previous tma-1 headphones retailed for
two hundred bucks
and are now available as the tma-2 DJ
preset for 200 bucks so what do you get
well nothing you didn't pay for if you
don't want inline controls don't buy
them if you know you want a longer cord
you're not forced to also pay for a
stock shorter one this entire concept
makes replacing damaged pieces or future
incremental upgrades pas
Cybil in a way that just isn't if you
have to replace an entire headphone at
once making them I guess more
sustainable too so bonus while we're on
that subject we've also got this one
headphone to rule them all thing going
on where you can actually transform them
from studio mode to sweaty gym mode by
swapping out the ear pads which takes
just a few seconds or from wired to
bluetooth just by unplugging the cable
now we're talking to be clear though we
are not saying the tma-2 is for everyone
and it's going to dethrone our favorite
headphones not by a longshot but the
best sounding headphones don't cost 150
to 250 bucks what we are saying is that
if that is your price range these look
great sound great and allow you to get
the right headphones for you instead of
the best compromise you can find on the
shelf
