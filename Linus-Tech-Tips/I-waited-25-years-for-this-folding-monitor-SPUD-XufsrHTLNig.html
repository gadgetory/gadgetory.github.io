was billed as a godsend for all manner
of situations
a high-resolution battery-powered
portable display for watching movies on
the train sharing presentations with
colleagues and being more productive
with your small screen laptop so then in
November 2016 I backed it on Kickstarter
and now two and a half years later I am
among the first to get my hands on to
row vias high-resolution portable
monitor
dear spud backer
we finally delivered it yay
accessories including an HDMI cable USB
type-c cable wall wart and North
American power plug
finally the spud itself so let's find
out if this was a good idea private
Internet access that's exactly what
you'll get with PIAA a safe and
protected IP and it's got loads of other
features as well check it out at the
link in the video description
I think the best way to tackle a product
like this is to go through the
manufacturers selling points one at a
time so we'll start with what exactly it
is it's a 24 inch display that collapses
and expands like a ruggedized umbrella
well I'm not familiar with the term
ruggedized umbrella but I guess it might
be something a little bit like this oh
sure and the display area is comfortably
24 inches which are oviya points out is
23 times larger than a smartphone screen
although I don't know how well those
numbers hold up now that iphones don't
look like this anymore their point does
still stand though if you're watching a
movie this is a lot bigger than this
that said as I'm always reminding my
wife there's more to life than size so
let's go ahead and fire it up and have a
look at the performance so to get it
connected we've got a single HDMI input
the type see here is actually only for
charging that's not a separate input
we've got our power button which we hold
down for 4 seconds until it flashes
that'll turn it on you can see we've got
about 75 percent battery it does have
integrated speakers apparently so
there's our volume up and volume down
we've got a brightness control wheel and
a USB 5 volt output down here we've got
an exhaust vent so it is actively cooled
I can actually feel the fan blowing in
my face right now as well as an intake
and then this is our focus knob and then
we've got one of those little threaded
inserts for throwing it on like a little
tripod or something like that so
theoretically it should now be working
actually all right there we go
I kind of wish I could see what you guys
are seeing cuz from my perspective I am
pretty disappointed by the brightness in
person but I don't know how exactly the
camera is capturing it David how would
you how would you say how representative
would you say the experience is like it
looks brighter on camera than in real
life alright like to put this in
perspective ladies and gentlemen here
I'm gonna turn my lcd all the way down
to mega ultra power saving how do they
compare now maybe it can go brighter
still cuz like here's where I would
normally use this thing I'd say let's
turn it up a little bit you crank it
those colors though like it's clearly
purple and like on the chrome logo
there's no distinction between the white
circle around the blue dot in the middle
and the yellow part of the wheel like
nothing here let's put something white
on the screen you'd think given the
specs of the projector and the distance
of the screen are known quantities but
they would have been able to get the
image a little bit closer to the edge
like there's not there's not really a
way that I could conceivably get it to
stick out further so I could get a
bigger image out of it I'm gonna try to
adjust the focus though that's kind of
rough actually so you can see the focus
of right dead center is actually not bad
but there's a lot of blur up in the
corners and even I'd say anywhere
outside about a sort of four inch
diameter circle in the middle is
noticeably blurry materials quality
seems alright for the most part though
this is a nice lightweight but durable
feeling fabric this is kind of floppy I
actually initially thought that maybe
this was some kind of stand or something
because got like this bend in here but I
couldn't find any meaningful way to to
prop it up on it so it seems like this
is basically how it mounts
so the thing is what really intrigued me
and probably a lot of the nearly 2,000
spud backers was the prospect of using
this thing as a high-resolution
secondary display for a laptop when
they're working on the go so kind of
kind of like this which I guess brings
us perfectly to our next selling point
use it everywhere all right
so watching movies well my main issue
with that is visual fidelity ROV is very
loosey-goosey use of the term high
resolution is something that I think
they could have done a better job of
it's only 720p and unfortunately no
amount of tinkering with the focus dial
off camera managed to fix the issue that
I was having with focus so no matter
what we load up on it it just doesn't
look good using it outside actually yeah
I could kind of see that but I'm also
pretty sure that they did some fairly
aggressive color grading in this
promotional video because from our
experience you're going to be using it
around dusk or later for sales
presentations yeah I could see this
fitting pretty nicely into a briefcase
or something like that that is as long
as there isn't already a TV or a
projector in the meeting room that
you're heading into and then for cooking
again yeah I could kind of see that as
long as you've got the counter space as
for the coffee shop sure having a big
screen display there might be nice but I
really don't know if you want to be that
guy I think overall you guys can kind of
see where I'm going with this most
places
truth be told just don't have like a
convenient four square feet of space to
plop down a fully deployed spud like at
two pounds it's obviously a lot lighter
than an old tube style CRT monitor but
it's merely the same size
bringing us to portability which i think
is probably the spuds most compelling
selling point because here's the thing
all of my convenience and image quality
complaints aside if I absolutely needed
a large screen display in any of those
situations this really is my only option
is what I would have said if in the last
two and a half years since I backed the
thing we hadn't seen a veritable
explosion of portable battery-powered
LCDs now I'm not saying that the spud
doesn't do some things well it's way
bigger than any portable display on the
market even that four thousand dollar
one from the soos and the material that
our oviya sourced for the projection
screen is spectacular
like check this out I wish they may have
never ironed shirts out of this stuff
because it's just it's actually kind of
amazing the inclusion of a healthy
integrated battery and a USB port for a
chromecast or something like that
that's a great feature and the overall
fit and finish of the thing just is
surprisingly good for a kick-started
product the thing is I just don't really
understand who this thing is for like on
the one hand they seem to be going after
the be like elegance crowd with the
whole size of a book thing in the
marketing but here's my issue with that
hold on let me just get this folded down
here we go saying to me that this is the
size of a book is kind of like saying
that a truck is about the size of a car
like yes this is a lot more like a book
than it is like a full tower computer
but this is a pretty big book and a
folded spud is more than double its size
by volume now as for the practicality
crowd well I think those folks are
probably buying pocket projectors for 50
bucks on Aliexpress
and pointing them out a pillowcase
propped up on a couple of sticks when
they go camping for myself though none
of that is really the main problem for
me the issue comes down to the price if
this thing was 99 bucks at the Walmart
I'd be like heck yeah that's basically
camping accessory territory but after
nearly four hundred US dollars that I
paid for this I would take the trade-off
in size any day of the week and go with
something like this Chinese portable
monitor I mean if it's not big enough
then all I have to do is sit a little
closer or pick it up and hold it since
it's so lightweight and the form factor
is so much like a tablet also since the
resolution isn't straight out of 2005
almost no matter how close I get to it
actually no matter how close I get to it
it's still going to look a lot better
than the spud
