something I'm I'm actually really
excited about so I never got a chance to
try the PC 360s from Sennheiser which
were basically kind of like an open
version of the PC 350 s these are the
people okay I can't really show you them
this is a black box with absolutely
nothing on and no out these are the PC
360 3ds which are an upgraded version of
the PC 360s
with a couple of tweaks so much like the
PC 350 SES which it's just like it's
ergonomic squeaks more than anything
else the 360 3ds make a couple of cool
changes so first of all let's see what
Sennheiser has to say for themselves two
year warranty noise cancelling mic what
else they got 7.1 bilby sound card
included very cool now it should be
noted guys buy 7.1 I mean virtual 7.1 if
there's any headphone that you see that
actually has three speakers per ear
disregard them they're not a serious
product because you have two ears so you
should need exactly two audio sources
when they're right next to your ears in
order to generate surround sound as long
as it's being done properly you do not
need a bunch of speakers around your
ears and you're sacrificing driver size
for this perceived value of having
multiple speakers so ya go with Virtual
Surround if you must have surround
triple-xl velvet ear pads pro noise
cancelling microphone integrated volume
control in the air cap and a high
quality rugged cable is what they have
to say for themselves it's pretty much
it so let's have a look at what we've
got included in the box there's a Quick
Start Guide which shows you how to get
the 3d game one sort of thing going on
which I believe is their USB doodad this
guy right here so it plugs in via USB
it's a sound card 3d Game one engaged
I'll look at that lights up when you
plug it in and it's got like little
cable management things going on here so
you can go ahead and run your cable
through here into here and then it'll
just kind of sit there like that and
look all style it's got some weight to
it which is really encouraging because
you see plenty of these little you
be soundcard so what they essentially
are is there an amp and the digital
analog converter it's a sound card and
it just runs over USB sound is not
particularly data intensive so it's not
necessary - ok interesting that's
probably what Oh need ok so you probably
push it in order to engage surround and
then you turn it off - not so you see
lots of these things and the included
ones often weigh nothing they seem
really cheaply made this one does not it
has a metal backing on it has a nice
sliding piece led so yeah please install
the software driver before inserting
this into your support you don't have to
use that though and quite frankly if
you're someone like me who already hears
an extension cable there you go so you
can cause a nice short cable on it if
you're someone like me who has what is
quite frankly a better audio solution
than this I mean for all however good
this might be I have a better one this
is an a soos essence one this is a 600
700 dollar DAC an amp that is dedicated
for just amplifying headphones I also
have as owners ents in the computer
itself so there's one of those which is
also got a headphone amp on it also a
very high quality sound card so I would
opt to use them with the analog
connections and this is what drives me
crazy about headsets that come with just
a USB connection you don't even have the
option of plugging them in using a
higher quality source so you can't buy
them as sort of a stepping stone in
between while I'm going to upgrade my
headphones now and then I'll upgrade my
sound card later so I love the ones that
give you the option by including these
connectors which I really don't think
cost that much and including the USB
sound card as a separate piece so these
feel very reminiscent of my HD 5 v 5s
they have that same Velvet earcup design
they are an open design which means that
I can hear what's around me and people
can hear what I'm listening to
like many Sennheiser headphones they
have quite a hard foam it's doesn't
yield much but what that means is that
they will eventually break in over time
and my 5 v 5s are incredibly comfortable
now that I've had them for a long time
I like that Sennheiser has a nice wide
headband on this this is something that
I complain about when I scene
headbands because it just spreads out
the pressure on your head a bit more and
makes them more comfortable out of the
box now the other advantage of an open
headphone is that it's good for
ventilation air is allowed to freely
pass in and out and around your ears so
you might not end up with that like that
sweat mark around the outside of your
head that you can get sometimes with the
the pleather or I mean okay using like
genuine leather is better but using like
a pleather or a plastic material here
can cause that got a nice long cable on
here so it's one Linus arm span by about
another sort of Linus arm length so
presumably that's around I guess eight
feet long or so no inline controls as
you guys may or may not have noticed and
personally I prefer this because inline
controls you've got five kind of fumble
for them in the middle of something is
it's not actually that great so the
microphone is controlled by simply hold
on I don't know if you guys are going to
hear this there's a little click there
raising and lowering the microphone will
mute it and activate it just like that
and then volume control is done with a
dial here on the right headphone so I
prefer this I think this is better than
fumbling around for it and it's very
intuitive
I want to mute my mic I put my mic up I
want it on I put it down the mic is
adjustable but only a little bit I do
like retractable mics better than these
boom mics so you can adjust where it
sits in relation to your head it's noise
cancelling so you've got that's the
noise cancellation mic on the back and
that's the one for your actual voice but
what you'll notice is that for someone
like me with a big schnoz if I bring
this into the correct position close to
my mouth here I'm going to be breathing
on it directly so as long as the noise
cancellation is good we shouldn't have
too much difficulty not much in terms of
ear cup rotation however unless your
ears are positioned sort of on the front
or the back of your head that's not
really going to be an issue and size
adjustments are ample check this out so
I could wear them comfortably with about
this much space on the top of my head
and then if I was a very small person
and I wanted to wear headphones then I
would wear them about like that so
you're going to not have too much
trouble with that non detachable cable I
think that pretty much covers a nice big
ear cup so even with even with wearing
earrings you can see they've got a
little
box in there so these are little tweaks
that Sennheiser makes to make sure that
their audio products sound better than
other people's audio products there's
your open ventilation holes in the side
there so yeah so I should probably show
you guys this one last thing so even
though I wear earrings there's still no
pressure on the earrings against the
side of my head and that's one of the
things that I find so comfortable about
these nice extra-large ear cap style
headphones from the likes of Sennheiser
thank you for checking out this unboxing
and first look at the 360 3d from
Sennheiser don't forget to subscribe to
honest tech tips from unboxings reviews
and other sorry I muted it there I
thought that we had a bit of a problem
there but it turned out that it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
