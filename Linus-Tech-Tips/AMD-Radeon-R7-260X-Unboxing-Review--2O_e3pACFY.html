cube case is great for air cooling or
liquid cooling check the link in the
video description to learn more welcome
to another unboxing today we've got the
Radeon r7 260x and what this card is if
you don't feel like watching the rest of
the video is basically a Radeon 77 90
but with some more features and with
more performance so this is part of
AMD's new generation of products which
they're calling the r7 + r9 series r7
refers to performance class GPUs and r9
refers to enthusiasts class GPUs so what
is the key difference well one is price
this sits in that sweet spot between a
hundred and two hundred dollars where
you can typically get some of the best
bang for the buck the other difference
is in well obviously performance so this
card right here is not designed for you
know 3 by 1080p I affinity setups or
anything like that this is for gaming in
modern titles at 1080p
it has 896 stream processors it has 2
gigs of RAM and it is clocked at one
point one gigahertz on the core out of
the box which is very very cool because
it's the fastest stock GPU speed we've
ever seen out of AMD it's got a typical
board power of 115 Watts so it's
relatively low power consumption and
that is reflected by the single PCI
Express 6 pin connector on it you can
also we'll do a quick tour of the part
here where you can see that the the
stock reference card is going to have a
flower style heatsink so you can see
there's going to be airflow coming from
that single 80 millimeter fan that is
going to be just pushed down all over
the card all over the memory in the VRM
the vrm is the only part of the board
other than the GPU itself that has a
heatsink directly on it so you can see
it's located up here near the front of
the board it uses PCI Express 3.0 for
connectivity although on cards of this
calibre it doesn't really make much of a
difference and on the back we've got the
typical AMD layout - dual link DVI HDMI
and DisplayPort but there's a big
difference here AMD has changed the r7 +
r9 series to allow three displays at
1080p 60 Hertz running off of DVI
Evi and hdmi so you no longer need a
display port adapter very cool stuff
next up we've got the crossfire
connector which is present on the 260x
and the back of the card where we don't
see a whole lot there so let's talk
about some of the technologies that are
included before we hand things over to
slick to tell us about the performance
compared to the competition so number
one is zero core zero core refers to aim
DS ability to basically turn the GPU
entirely off when you're not doing
anything allowing you to save power when
you're idling or not doing much on your
computer which let's face it a lot of
computers do the next feature that at
the time of filming this video is
completely unique to this card is true
audio which is a programmable DSP right
on the graphics card for you guys
guessed it audio this allows the sound
engineers that work on your favorite
games to offload that processing that
would normally be done on the CPU and
have it done instead on the GPU itself
this means that you're going to be able
to get much more realistic audio effects
so in particular convolution reverb is a
technique that uses what you'd kind of
consider to be an image of a room and
how sound should behave in it so the
materials it's made of the shape so that
when you walk into a dungeon it'll echo
and the drips of water will bounce
around off the walls versus when you
walk out it's a much more open feeling
experience this has been implemented in
theif I saw a demo of it and it actually
works it's the first time we've seen any
kind of real advancements in Hardware
sound for games since EAX so that's very
very exciting but right now just this
card although guys stay tuned very soon
there will be at least another card or
two with this feature implemented next
up is mantle this is really to me the
big news about the r7 + r9 series of
cards because they're DirectX 11 point 2
cards which is an API so they're also
compatible to OpenGL and oh wait but
mantle is now a third API that AMD wants
developers using they want to leverage
the experience that developers have
developing games on the latest
generation of consoles the ps4 on the
Xbox one to use that same type of
approach to program for desktop PC GPUs
so what mantle
is it bypasses directx and opengl
completely forgets about those and is
actually a completely new way that the
game engine can interact almost directly
with the card at a much lower level this
should turn into some very tangible
performance improvements and I'm
extremely excited to see where this
technology goes but there are some
caveats because obviously if we have
game developers they you know they have
to support DirectX a lot of them support
OpenGL and then now mantle and then what
if Nvidia had their own and then what if
Intel had their own four onboard
graphics and all of a sudden we've put a
lot of extra load on the game devs well
let's hope it doesn't go down that path
but for now AMD is telling us that game
devs have been asking them for this and
in particular because of their presence
in every next-gen console well it might
actually succeed so that's extremely
exciting there's a new fan profile as
well as an updated power tune so the fan
profile allows much more gradual ramp
down and ramp up speeds of the fan so
you don't hear that very rear when the
temperatures are sitting on a threshold
where it changes quite frequently and
power tune now accounts not only for GPU
clock speed overall board power and
power consumption but also temperatures
so this is much like GPU boost 2.0 where
you have a lot more granular control of
how the card behaves with that said
overclocking has been simplified
somewhat to the point where all you
really do now is adjust your maximum
clock up and then the card will run sort
of wherever it can you can make some
adjustments to the power limits of the
boards however the temperature limits
come in pretty much set to their maximum
so the only way to really you know
leverage more overclocking either than
just turning that slider up is going to
be to add better cooling to your
graphics card the raptor app is
something that AMD is talking about a
fair bit which is a way of connecting
with other gamers it's platform agnostic
it allows you to get rewards for playing
and most importantly this is another
competitor for an Nvidia technology
they've had for a little while the
GeForce experience it allows you to with
one button just say look optimize my
settings for this game I care more about
the appearance of it or I care more
about the performance of it and it'll
just figure out what you want and it
uses cloud-based data sourcing so it
collects the non
data from everyone else running the game
as well as the performance they're
getting and then optimizes your
configuration based on other people who
have similar hardware who are running it
except ibly finally guys never settle as
always games come with your card however
stay tuned because never settle is
changing constantly so you're going to
want to check out what your card comes
with at the time without further ado I'm
going to hand this off to slick to tell
you guys about the performance of the r7
260x the charts are going to see here in
a moment are going to be quite general
they're going to have all the graphics
cards that I tested today on them but
what you should be focusing on is the
GTX 650 Ti boost and the r7 260x as they
are the most comparable cards on that
chart now one thing to note is that the
650 Ti boost has been out for quite a
while so it's been being optimized for a
very long time and the 260x is very
brand new running a beta driver and has
not been being optimized for that long
so we're likely to see the gap closing
up a little bit in the future and
another thing to note is that all r7
260x is our two gigabyte now while if
you have one monitor that's 1080p or
below that may not matter too much but
if you want to personally prepare
yourself for what you might do in the
future getting more RAM on your card is
a good idea because it's like you had
more monitors or go to higher
resolutions or just general games in the
future it'll help a lot to have that
extra memory onboard as you guys have
seen in the charts so far it's actually
pretty close fight but there is a little
bit of differential there so if you
liked the video like the video if you
just liked the video dislike the video
and in the comment section what do you
think of mantle and what do you think
it's going to do to the future of gaming
