unbox this is the pyro SC and hold on
wait before you guys say SC stands for
slow addition which has happened to us
so many times in the PC industry I mean
think back even going back as far as
like radio on 9000 series cards I see
you met slow addition or well you know
that other four-letter word that starts
with s addition no this time it means
special edition in a way that is not
like special it means special like
faster so the difference between the
pyro and the pyro S II is that instead
of using a sync flash which would make
the regular pyro equivalent to something
like an agility 3 so that is pretty much
as low end as it gets in terms of sand
force 2281 say 2 3 6 gigabit per second
drives the pyro SC uses synchronized
flash which gives you essentially better
eye ops performance as well as faster
sustained reason right so here and we're
not quite done with the packaging just
yet so what does patreon have to say for
themselves these are pretty ho-hum sort
of things to call out about this drive I
think the stuff on the back is actually
better and else the architecture means
we're using mlc flash I might have said
synchronous flash but ok
se3 technology ok that's good two and a
half inch form factor but here here's
all the good stuff ok low power
consumption yes say 2/3 shock and
vibration resistant which all SSDs are
silent operation which all SSDs are and
free technical support which not all
SSDs are so that's kind of cool to have
and you got a three-year warranty and
let's go ahead and see what else we got
in here we got a little booklet which
shows us ok some like specs of the drive
some other more different specs of the
drive um that's interesting
no I think these are quite generic Hey
look at that installation instructions
for computer systems desktops and
servers and installation instructions
for notebooks so let's go ahead and take
the drive out this guy's capable of 550
megabytes per second reads 520 megabytes
per second writes and eighty-five
thousand random 4ki ups so this
like I said before is a very high-end
SST the only way to go higher-end is to
get something like a patriot wildfire
which has toggle meant so those are the
Toshiba flash chips this is using I
can't actually open it up and find out
which synchronous flash they're using
but it would be using some kind of a
synchronous flash because guys there are
three grades of flash chips so right now
in terms of sand force controllers
there's only the 2281
on the desktop side that's pretty much
it so we've got only really one
controller and then from there it comes
down to the quality of the flash chips
so a sync flash is the cheapest flash
that's the flash that is going to give
you slightly less performance
synchronous flash is more expensive
flash than async and it comes with
slightly higher performance and then
finally at the very top end our toggle
of chips which are these special Toshiba
ones that are even faster but the
difference between toggle chips and sync
flash is not as pronounced as the
difference between sync flash and async
flash so this represents kind of the the
bang for the buck option in the middle
and it's pretty much standard looking as
far as SSDs go so you got your mounting
holes on the side you got your mounting
holes on the bottom depending on how
your notebook mounts to drive remember
you can use this and pretty much any
notebook including MacBooks desk rather
Windows PCs there's your SATA power
there's your SATA data so but we're
actually going to be using this drive
for is for some fraps recording so that
was why we went ahead and unbox this
we're also going to be looking at using
two of these drives so we have two I'm
going to use the box to represent one of
the drives and the drive to represent
another one we're gonna run them in raid
and we're gonna look at what kind of a
performance difference we can get using
a dual SSD raid array versus a larger
hard drive raid array in terms of the
read and write pure fruit book
performance we can get for users who for
example might be working with very large
files whether it's video editing or
image editing so that's one of the other
things that's going to be upcoming on my
NCIX comm channel with this particular
drive so thank you for checking out this
