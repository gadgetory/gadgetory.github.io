box this is the pyro SE and hold on wait
before you guys say se stands for slow
edition which has happened to us so many
times in the pc industry i mean think
back even going back as far as like
radeon 9000 series cards SE met slow
addition or well you know that other
four letter word that starts with s
edition no this time it means special
edition in a way that is not like
special it means special like faster so
the difference between the pyro and the
pyro se is that instead of using a sink
flash which would make the regular pyro
equivalent to something like an agility
3 so that is as pretty much as low end
as it gets in terms of San force 2281
say 236 gigabit per second drives the
pyro SE uses synchronized flash which
gives you essentially better I ops
performance as well as faster sustained
reason right so here we're not quite
done with the packaging just yet so what
does Patriot have to say for themselves
these are pretty ho-hum sort of things
to call out about this drive i think the
stuff on the back is actually better NLC
architecture means we're using mlc flash
I might have said synchronous flash but
okay say the three technology okay
that's good two and a half inch form
factor but here here's all the good
stuff okay low power consumption yes say
23 shock and vibration resistant which
all SSDs are silent operation which all
SSDs are and free technical support
which not all SSDs are so that's kind of
cool to have and you got a three year
warranty and let's go ahead and see what
else we got in here we got a little
booklet which shows us okay some like
specs of the drives and other more
different specs of the drive um that's
interesting no I think these are quite
generic hey look at that installation
instructions for computer systems
desktops and servers and installation
instructions for notebooks let's go
ahead and take the drive out this guy's
capable of five hundred and fifty
megabytes per second reads 520 megabytes
per second rights and 85,000 random 4k I
up so this is
like I said before is a very high-end
SST the only way to go higher end is to
get something like a patriot wildfire
which has toggle meant so those are the
toshiba flash chips this is using I
can't actually open it up and find out
which synchronous / they're using but it
would be using some kind of a
synchronous flash because guys there are
three grades of flash chips so right now
in terms of sandforce controllers
there's only the 2281 on the desktop
side that's pretty much it so we've got
only really one controller and then from
there it comes down to the quality of
the flash chip so a sink flash is the
cheapest flash that's the flash that is
going to give you slightly last
performance synchronous flash is more
expensive flash than a sink and it comes
with slightly higher performance and
then finally at the very top end our
toggle chips which are the special
toshiba ones that are even faster but
the difference between toggle chips and
sink flash is not as pronounced as the
difference between sink flash and a sink
flash so this represents kind of the the
bang for the buck option in the middle
and it's pretty much standard looking as
far as SSDs go so you got your mounting
holes on the side you got your mounting
holes on the bottom depending on how
your notebook mounts to drive remember
you can use this and pretty much any
notebook including macbooks desk either
Windows PCs there's your state of power
there's your state of data so but we're
actually going to be using this drive
for is for some fraps recording so that
was why we went ahead and unbox this
we're also going to be looking at using
two of these drives so we have to I'm
going to use the box to represent one of
the drives and the drive to represent
another one we're going to run them in
raid and we're going to look at what
kind of a performance difference we can
get using a dual SSD raid array versus a
larger hard drive raid array in terms of
the read and write pure fruit book
performance we can get for users who for
example might be working with very large
files whether it's video editing or
image editing so that's one of the other
things that's going to be upcoming on my
NCIX comm channel with this particular
drive so thank you for checking out this
