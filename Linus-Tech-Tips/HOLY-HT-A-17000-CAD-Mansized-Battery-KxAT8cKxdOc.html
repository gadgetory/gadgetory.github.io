little segment we call holy Sh
and today it really is a holy moment
isn't it because this right here my
friends this is a battery the size of a
man and this right here is all the other
crap that goes with it
oh yeah and did I mention it cost us
$17,000 Oh
Tunnel Bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you use the web as
though you are in one of the 20
different countries learn more and try
total bear for free at the link in the
video description so we'll kick things
off with what the unboxing experience
would be like for a $17,000 my okay
that's Canadian rupees mind you but it's
still a lot of money a $17,000 battery
backup this is the PW 12 s 12 K - PD
from Eaton and it is part of their
ninety 170 plus line of formerly known
as power where uninterruptible power
supplies this baby right here is a 12
unit chassis and you can actually fill
those units with power modules or
battery modules depending on whether you
want to supply more power to the items
that you want to backup or whether you
want the runtime to be longer when the
power goes out so the one that we have
is a 12 kilo volt amp unit capable of
delivering about 10,000 watts of power
because we have filled it up with I
believe it is four of their three
thousand kilovolt amp units and then we
have filled the entire rest of this 12
12 a chassis with battery backups
allowing us to have this puppy run at
full load for I think something to the
tune of 26 or 28 minutes under full
freaking 10,000 watt load or at half
load for about an hour before it
actually needs to engage the software
mechanisms that it has to safely shut
down all of our server components you
might be asking yourself - you guys had
one - UPS units what the devil happened
with all of those why are you getting an
additional tower UPS - to take their
place well we had some issues with the
GE ones they were refurb units the
batteries problem something at cetera
etc anyway we're not using them anymore
and Johnny - our networking guru guy
recommended this so we bit the bullet
and went you know what with all the data
loss scares we've had lately
and the issues that we've had with power
outages in this area we've had some
serious storms we are not going to screw
around anymore we're getting a proper
proper backup unit and this my friends
is what something like that might look
like yeah I think this is just just the
chassis so it's actually bolted onto
this pallet no it is not it is not
bolted onto the pallet so we should be
able to remove it fairly easily but
let's take a look at the rear of it
first okay so at the top we've got a
serial port as well as a couple of bays
for network modules one of which we got
so it'll be able to communicate over the
network then we've got 12 and these each
have their own 20 amp reset switches in
them so we've got 12 l 14 30 are outlets
men we move down into the freaking like
heavy freaking duty stuff and we've got
three L six thirty are outlets so those
are these three prong twisty locky ones
right here and finally we have three
more of the L 1430 our quad quad prong
outlets going on here so these puppies
are for like super high draw 240 volt
equipment that can leverage the
efficiency of the higher voltage in
order to well be more efficient so you
might find this in like very high-end
server here we would mostly be using
these guys okay so the first thing
Johnny the network guy and I are gonna
do is move you bastard should we twist
it we should twist it okay awesome so
this gives us a look at the front so
here's where the the 12 like bay module
things go in so you can actually see the
interfaces at the back here they have
what look like like kind of smaller ATX
power supply connectors on them and then
they have what looks like about a 24 26
pin likely proprietary connector back
here and then a couple more little guys
right here so the cool thing about this
modular system is you can actually put
batteries or power modules anywhere you
want and then the backplane at the back
sorts the whole thing out you can
actually even daisy chain multiples of
these together
however I really don't think we're going
to need more than 10,000 watts in our
server room for the foreseeable future
this user's guide I mean I don't blame
them I mean this thing is not your
simple plug into the wall and then hope
you don't I guess it works just fine in
fact with the 12000 kilovolt ampere unit
that we've got we've had to wire up a
completely separate ad amp breaker and
then we have to hardwire this guy into
that if you want to get one of the
bigger units the 12 or the 15 kilo volt
amp units you actually need here check
this out or the other 15 or the 18 you
need a 100 amp or 125 amp breaker and
then you have to have an electrician
come in and wire this thing in with
these be well we make that news of this
so here's some more accessories these
are doodads that go in here that's not
how they go on so I probably shouldn't
force the issue that is how they go on
some of you are probably wondering what
the point of something like this is and
here well the walk and talk walk and
talk so I'll take this over to where
it's going so the point of having a UPS
unit that fully loaded is going to wait
way somewhere in the neighborhood of 600
to 700 pounds is that it will not only
act as a battery backup but will also
actually condition the power that is
coming into our server rooms so because
this is an online double conversion UPS
all of our server gear will be running
100% of the time off of the batteries
and because it uses very very high
quality inverters that isn't an issue
like it would be with a consumer-grade
UPS the other benefit of double
conversion on line ups is is that in the
event of a power outage there is
absolutely zero delay between oh wow
thanks Johnny we don't wanna run over
that network cable there is zero delay
once the power goes out when it needs to
when a normal UPS like a chief o
consumer grade one would actually have
to switch between AC power
and battery power meaning that your
equipment is never subjected to that
kind of stress which leads us very well
to where we're going to be installing it
so Harry Potter thought he was kidding
yeah upgrade to his closet when the
contractor showed up but it was all a
lie
Harry Potter's closet is now this big
and we are actually going to be sealing
the ups into the now expanded server
room which in addition to its four
dedicated 15 amp circuits here
additional 15 amp circuit here also has
I believe this is a 100 amp circuit that
we had wired in we're going to directly
attach to the tune ups and then it'll
sit right here and plug into all of our
gear
bippity bop just like that cardboard is
both a blessing and a curse listen slow
ok cool now I got the weight go ahead
and pull the card out and that's pretty
much that
alright let's check this baby out
so inside this second pallet that
arrived today we are going to find our
power units and our battery units as
well as our what it was is a 350 dollar
like 100 megabit network card what a
scam the freaking scan enterprise gear
is wool the clothes was proprietary and
we decided that were buttholes whew
skids out I didn't know you were gonna
be here Dennison I've only gotten me and
Johnny covered so how many power modules
did we get it was free right Johnny no
four four four power modules
feel like I work at like Fort Knox
because I'm moving heavy stuff that
costs way too much or whoa that's heavy
holy crap okay okay I'll help steer hold
on so I broke a wall oh okay I'm okay
I'm fine I'm good yeah that's fine
that's good for the foot okay this
bastard needs to go in there I guess
well we shouldn't load them first right
we should put it in there first and then
load them right sure okay let's do this
let's watch that height yeah we're good
yeah a measuring tape go T measure
months hope for the best okay how are we
doing now we're in
no big deal okay so let's start loading
up some modules shall we ooh whoa okay I
broke a thing that was quick oh really
it's this clip why did it go inside did
you see her to trickle down here oh you
got to be kidding me
oh it's right it's like what the hell
yeah what the hell Eitan I don't even
know how these side panels come off
there like scaled over top of each other
here I see it too what the hell eat you
got it Wow okay all right let's do this
I'm like sweating
I don't know if I'm sweating because it
cost so much or because this is heavy
sure oh yeah you take the cool stuff I
get to do the stupid batteries so this
feels like a handle oh cool okay I think
I know I don't at all actually what oh
yeah I see it
cool so this we should do batteries on
the bottom I guess right so the
batteries plug into these puppies and
then the power modules plug into the
other set what the heck
I can't tell content enough Oh seems to
be a mile is that like a zero insertion
force connector that's cool
that'll make the hot swap really easy so
you can actually actually hot swap
batteries and power modules at will
assuming that you have enough enough
extra for the power modules that you're
not just overloading the unit when you
pull out all the power modules or
whatever so this is interesting the
cooling actually intakes at the back and
then exhausts on this side over here oh
that's a good look at at the guts of
this baby here that's some big copper
coils and aluminum heat sinks they got
going on in there not to mention you
know the resistors and then yeah Wow
so Oh careful Johnny so that is pretty
much it we've got all the power modules
loaded in all the battery modules loaded
in and all that's left is back here
we're going to take three copper wires
from our panel put them into the back of
the unit plug some extension cords into
our servers and bippity-boppity-boo we
are ready to rock with our massive 1000
watt battery back up and on a totally
unrelated note mass drop and this is
pretty cool they've got the k7 xx
limited edition ruby-red headphones in
addition to all the other cool stuff
over at mass drop comm which by the way
you can check out at the link in the
video description this particular drop
though and it's the same usual concept
the more people buy the better the price
this is a limited edition of the k 7x
headphones that I actually reviewed here
the only real difference is that this
run uses red accents on the ear cups and
the headband please note this is a
limited drop with only 1500 units so if
you want a pair you're going to want to
act pretty fast in terms of spec it was
configured by mass drop and manufactured
by AKG these are open backed headphones
with very very large cushiony ear cups
they've got a flat wire voice coil very
motion to layer diaphragm
genuine leather headband actually that's
really nice memory foam ear pads with
velour covering of the way eight point
three ounces okay there's an awful lot
of specs in my notes here many of which
are not terribly important to your
warranty covered by mass drop and if
you're ordering from outside the US you
can still get it but please note that
your distribution will be handled
through a third party so a twenty five
dollar fee will be assessed to all
international orders so if you want to
check this out and get yourself the
ruby-red pair of k7 xx's just head over
to draw ups /lt TK 7 xx to see that and
all the other awesome stuff that they
have on mass drop so thanks for checking
