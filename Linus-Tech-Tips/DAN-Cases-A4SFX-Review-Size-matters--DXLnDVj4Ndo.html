a fabulous little enclosure linus
recently used it in this video and he
liked it a lot
but since he apparently couldn't be
arsed to give any real information about
it i promptly stole it from him for a
proper review like the anti-hero that i
and while I was still intoxicated by the
thrill of the heist I noticed a couple
reasons Linus may have liked this case
not only did Dan and Linus demonstrate a
shocking like-mindedness by both naming
their companies after their first names
but this case is tiny
something that Linus must be able to
emphasize with oh okay now before I get
fired let's roll the intro
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description with a quick glance at
the a for SFX you may be inclined to
think of Lian Li and that isn't that
surprising as Dan's om for this project
is in fact Lian Li an expensive choice
but one that comes with stellar build
quality and quality materials throughout
the case as we go through our overview
just so you know starting with the front
of the case we have a reserved aesthetic
with only two things breaking through
the solid brushed aluminum panel a USB
3.0 plug and a power button which is
unfortunately wobbly and does not
feature a tactile click but does manage
to suit the case perfectly and almost
fade away into the rest of the panel one
important thing to note here is that
there is no illumination of any kind
built into this case and as someone who
is building a computer this small may
also be interested in quiet computing I
may recommend getting an LED strip of
some sort like the cable mod setup Linus
had in this build in order to show some
form of sign that your computer is even
on both of the side panels are more or
less identical featuring very large
circular mesh areas so that your
graphics card on the left-hand side and
your CPU cooler and power supply on the
right-hand side can all breathe easily
these side panels are both held on by a
pair of screws on the bottom and Leon
Lee's ball and socket pressure mounts
which are so stiff that if you are so
inclined you could ignore the screws
altogether with confidence that your
side panels are secure that's actually
pretty cool the top of the case also
features a large circular mesh area and
some screws that need to be undone along
with a couple on the bottom in order to
remove the top and front panels as one
solid piece of metal the bottom of the
case features some sort of styled air
holes and is a really weird SSD mounting
system that has easy to remove tool this
rubber mounts but then due to how
they're positioned and how the slots are
positioned you still have to unscrew two
of them in order to slide it out it's
not that bad
and it's probably done this way just to
make sure that it's secure but it
probably would have been just fine to
leave them in the other orientation so
you just slide it out easily oh well not
a big deal there's also four feet
they're not very grippy and they don't
really stick to anything very well but
they're effective enough while leaving
only a little to be desired at the back
is not much of note other than the first
really good look at the scale of the a4
SFX you can't quite appreciate it until
you have seen something like a known
quantity like a standard motherboard IO
panel
Linus wasn't really a fan of this gap
thing above the expansion card slot here
and while I didn't really mind it
personally I do see his point that
covering this with a little shroud or
something may have added some polish now
the specifications of this case are
rather important and that's what I'm
going to focus on now that we've covered
the outside of the case for a graphics
card it can accommodate a max height of
144 millimeters from the bottom of the
PCIe slot to the top of the card a max
width of 40 millimeters without a
backplate or 45 with one a max length of
306 millimeters with the bracket or 295
without now that may sound scary and
confining but it's really not that bad
as I was able to squeeze in an EVGA 1080
classified a massive card without issue
and at least part of the no issues with
this build is thanks to the clear
plastic shield that Dan included to
protect the back of your potentially not
backplate equipped GPU from the metal
internals of the case a good touch that
will assuredly save someone from some
amount of headache and motherboard
compatibility is amazing in its
unremarkable 'ti to explain the damn
case is only slightly larger than the
zotac magnus n 980 that we reviewed here
but instead of a proprietary motherboard
to go with its MXM form-factor graphics
card you can use standard i TX as long
as you note the max height of 48
millimeters and 52 millimeters for the
CPU cooler and memory respectively for
power supply you can choose either SFX
or the slightly longer s
Excel form factor although it should be
noted that while you'll gain a usually
quieter 120-millimeter fan you'll be
restricting yourself from three
potential to two potential two and a
half inch drives with that being said
I'd probably stick with the front mount
and the lower tray mount and leave the
upper tray mounted SSD out of the
picture regardless just for cable
management reasons the Dan case a for
SFX is beautiful efficient and actually
rather fun to build in that being said I
did find myself getting frustrated on a
number of occasions while working in it
but they weren't frustrations with this
particular build I was frustrated by
other cases for example while installing
the GPU which even with something like
an oversize classified was really easy
logical and straightforward I marveled
that something like the mid Tower sized
anodized AI crystal could cause problems
for me when the Dan was able to find a
elegant solution to cram into his mere
seven and a quarter liter of total
volume space case what
now speaking of graphics card Dan
recommends a blower style GPU and I
would second that but I also want to
note that even with my a VGA 1080
classified installed it did get hot but
it didn't throttle it may not have
boosted as high as it could have been a
different case with better airflow but
it was fine on the CPU side of things
the cooler is going to be pretty damn
similar to any other cooler that would
fit in this case there is no substitute
for surface area and a little bit of
mass because physics so these results
should be pretty representative of what
you'll get with a quad core and so on
now this was a crowdfunded project and
as such I've heard tales of shipping
issues but on the product side of things
at least great work din and I hope to
see more from you in the future
