Linus Tech Tips</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2011-03-29</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hzgRwGl91Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">so in this latest round of exploiting
migrant workers we've got the crazy
Russian working on the Vesta g1 so you
can see by his hand gestures he's
clearly completely insane and so I'm
going to take you guys on a quick tour
of what exactly he's working on so he's
got the video card power cables that he
is plugging into the modular corsair
ax850 power supply so this the modular
interface allows him to keep the cabling
nice and clean in the vested g1 so he's
going ahead and running that through the
awesome cable management features of the
Corsair 650g which is our custom painted
Vesta g1 edition of the corsair 650d so
this is the the green case that I've
shown you guys before so there's our
side panel with the clips in and the
grunt and the frame around the window
there it is crazy Russians going to show
that to us and then here is the other
plane side panel with the clips in as
well here's a runt view of the case
which looks absolutely phenomenal say
what you want about the color but I
personally think it was the right choice
because I'm the one who made the choice
it's not quite an Nvidia green like
something like the half X nvidia edition
would be it's actually a kawasaki bike
racing green so it's very very vibrant
the camera doesn't quite capture just
right just like it didn't with the Vesta
r1 which a lot of you guys said oh it
looks orange but in real life it
actually wasn't orange it was very very
red so yeah we're gonna take some still
photos tomorrow this baby's got a photo
shoot that it's due for once once all
the cabling is done and once we've got
all the hardware inside so there's our
976 core processor as well as our 12
gigs of course our Dominator memory the
gtx 590 as i mentioned before is being
installed right now no drives in here
yet because this is still an in-progress
build but our blu-ray writer is inside
so you can see here's the two 8-pin
power connectors that are required for
the gtx 590 we're going to have some
lighting in this system so we've got our
green LED lighting we're actually going
to have green
LED fans this time around these are
sickle flows from coolermaster and last
but not least we're going to have the
lighting that's present on the
motherboard green LEDs here as well as
green and white LED lit GeForce logo and
name on the side of the card so this
thing is going to look absolutely sick
once we get it completed so this is our
in progress video for the day don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
from unboxings reviews computer videos
and all that other good stuff more to
come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
