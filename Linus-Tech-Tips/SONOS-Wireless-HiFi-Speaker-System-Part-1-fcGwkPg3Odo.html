they actually sent over so much stuff I
didn't really know where to begin so I
decided to split it up into two videos
and start with a walkthrough of my
experience setting it up for the first
time with its factory tuning and data
center DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is
an amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts so let's kick
this off with wTF is Sonos well normally
I would try to put this in my own words
quite frankly they describe it better
than I can
Sonos is an app controlled system that
lets you control your music collection
from any device and lets you play what
you want in any room or every room over
your home network so these are two of
their speaker units the play 1 and the
play 3 their entry level / portable unit
and their mid-range unit respectively
they do have a higher end play 5 for
larger rooms but I'm apparently too much
of a scrub for them to send me one of
those so inside the box you'll find a
Quick Start Guide in a variety of
languages a power cord an ethernet cable
and your fancy new speaker that's about
it they're about as easy to set up as
anything that I have ever configured
normally I see networked device and I
prepare to beat my head against the wall
for an hour or two but you actually just
plug it into your router then fire up
the app on your phone which prompts you
to press a couple of buttons on your
speaker and it's done nearly instantly
it's so easy that my wife could have set
it up almost as quickly as I did alright
cool
- but what's the point well when you've
only got one speaker at first I'd have
said it's kind of like any random
Bluetooth speaker I was using the Sonos
app to play music stored locally on my
phone over Wi-Fi and I was a little
disappointed playback was stutter free
so for just continuously streaming a
playlist it was perfect but the app is
just not suitable for managing even a
medium-sized music collection it's
search functionality doesn't look in
your locally stored files and even just
scrolling through your list of songs is
leggy and unresponsive so I kept
exploring and glory be on their website
I found out that aside from the usual
iOS and Android phone and tablet apps
they have a desktop app too
all right now they've got my attention
even though they neglected to put an
analogue input on the things they're
letting me legitimately control it from
anywhere
neat back to the app I found some more
options you can stream from an iTunes
library windows media streamer and even
better than that for people like me
whose music file tags are a mess because
they still have music from CDs they
ripped with music match jukebox they
have a folder based navigation schema to
just pick songs you want to play and cue
them up or put them in a playlist this
is cool because using it this way unlike
a Bluetooth speaker your sono system can
keep doing whatever you told it to do
even if you get out of range or your
phone battery dies ok but back to
streaming my phone's local content again
I wanted to try something and turned off
my Wi-Fi midstream it's got quite the
buffer on it but of course after a
little while the music stopped then I
turned my Wi-Fi back on and bam music
was playing again so at this point I was
like ok this is actually getting pretty
cool depending how you want to use it
you can make it so that when you get
home your music plays to greet you and
when you go out of range
it stops fantastic so next I added the
second speaker in another room my house
has Ethernet and powerline networking in
lots of places so I'm still running
everything over Ethernet in the next
video I'll talk about their wireless
bridge and the wireless functionality
but anyway this is where things started
to get really interesting adding another
speaker is as simple as firing up the
app and pressing the buttons again and
it's connected within seconds you assign
your speakers to a room name and now you
can either play completely different
content in each of those places or
something I figured out how to do with
VLC a few years back after a few hours
of tinkering and a PC hooked up in each
speaker location with the click of a
button you can group them together so
the music is perfectly synced in every
room as you move around your house it's
great for staying in your groove when
you're cleaning and this is exactly how
I could see myself falling into their
trap just keep saving pennies and adding
speakers until the whole house is hooked
up damn what a great product but it
actually continued to get better I
actually just recently finally got
around to picking up an antenna on
Amazon for my receiver so I could listen
to the radio I'm so old
now that feels entirely pointless with
son√≠s is integrated tuning internet
radio support yeah I don't need that
anymore
the in-app search still sucks but I was
able to manually navigate to all my
favourite stations local and otherwise
in the searches defense though it does
manage to find podcasts like twit so I
guess it's not totally useless but I
still found myself yearning for another
option the app is okay I mean it's got a
four plus star rating on the Play Store
and the advanced options are pretty
comprehensive so as a setup tool it's
fantastic but I was continued to be
really disappointed in its lackluster
integration with the rest of my Android
OS little things like unless it was in
the foreground pressing my volume up or
volume down wouldn't change music but my
ringtone instead and I found myself
really wishing that I could use another
app for music management and then just
stream it by clicking a little button
like with my Apple TV and after some
more digging around I found it now
clicking add music services in the app
just brings up a bunch of lame-o's stuff
because unlike the rest of the
developing world in Canada we don't have
cool streaming services like Amazon
Pandora and Spotify services that appear
to be what Sonos made these products for
but then I discovered the best thing
ever in the last couple of months two
things have happened Google Play Music
launched in Canada and Sonos integrated
it into the Google Music app so you can
use it exactly the way I wanted you just
have something you know running on your
headphones you press a button boom it's
playing over your sono system I'm about
as happy as I could be I actually just
signed up for Google musics is preview
zzyx
use extreme service and it's like the
best thing ever I control music volume
naturally I can properly navigate my
local content I can stream content it's
fantastic this is one of those very rare
products that took about a day to
convince me to legitimately change the
way I go about my daily life not many
things can do that but if all of this
sounded like a Sonos commercial up until
now I guess this is the part where they
decide not to slip me that Benjamin for
my review after all I strongly disagree
entirely with so Knossos use of the term
hi-fi to describe these speakers i've
only used the play one in the play
three so far but while the speakers
themselves might actually be fine what
Sonos calls warm full-bodied sound is
apparently equivalent to what I call
tuned for the beat generation with
overdone bass a little bit of trouble
and a mid-range that goes way beyond
veiled and unfortunately the EQ settings
are one of the weakest points of the
advanced settings within their app so
with only simple bass and treble sliders
so I couldn't even really find out if
the speakers are better than they sound
I mean I guess there's good news though
if you're one of those people who's
willing to spend way too much for an
actual hi-fi experience with better amp
stacks and speakers there in my opinion
unjustifiably expensive given they seem
to have the same functionality as the
other stuff but without an actual
speaker connect series lets you add your
own stuff to your sono setup but most
people myself included likely won't care
enough to bother with that expense if
you're not cranking things up I have to
grudgingly admit that the warm sound
signature works really well for
background music which is exactly what I
personally intend to use my so nose gear
for so I'll probably just stick with the
speakers and I guess that's it that's
how part one of this review ends Sonos
is gear particularly the software is
just so different from other solutions
that i've tried for managing audio
around my home it is such a joy to use
that throughout the entire experience I
was able to enjoy my music as i tinkered
with it and not once did it frustrate me
to the point that I needed to stop
working on the review and go do
something else for a little while
something that happens a lot highly
recommended so far if you've got enough
shiny pennies to afford it in part two
I'll be adding the wireless bridge and
some more speakers to the home setup and
I'll be hooking up their play bar to my
media center with a couple of play ones
linked up as surround speakers let me
know if there's anything else that you'd
