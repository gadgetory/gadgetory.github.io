interesting to me because I copy a lot
of data around so what I have here is my
little chart that I'm gonna make and I'm
going to be looking at the performance
of various USB chipsets and various
drive solutions so I have three
different solutions that I'm going to be
using the first of which you can see
here is I'm going to do a oh did I
sprite one terabyte oh boy it's been a
long day already guys these are all what
you know what let's just yeah these are
all one gigabyte file copies okay so the
first solution is a USB 3 seagate goflex
adapter plugged into a patriot wildfire
drive so this is one of the highest
performance drive it it's pretty much
the highest performance drive on the
market so we're going to see what kind
of thorough put we can get using that
next we have a seagate freeagent goflex
is a 5400 RPM storage shed this is also
hooked up to a USB 3 chipset here at the
back the one I have here is the native a
75 chipset 1 i'm going to compare that
against the as media one which based on
that it's just started turning up and
it's on masseuse board i'm guessing it's
our own kind of custom thing and it's
probably going to turn up on other
asuste boards in the future so the
performance may be relevant i'm also
going to test against the ever-popular
ren assess so this is on some of the
higher end boards particularly they used
to be NEC usb3 chipsets so you can see
I've got one here on these e68 a GD 80
and finally I'm going to test against us
be too so I'm going to test against
Intel's USB to controller just because
it's a much more known quantity than the
one on this a 75 chipset the last drive
configuration I'm going to test is the
mishkan ventura pro this is a USB 3
drive and I'm going to find out what the
difference in performance is between a
high-performance USB thumb drive like
this an extreme performance SSD on USB 3
and a regular hard drive on USB 3 0
all these different platforms so I'll be
back with results or with any abnormal
findings throughout the testing here so
the first round of testing on the asuste
a 75 board is done so on the a75
controller accidentally brought these in
the wrong box I got thirty four point
five megabytes per second consistently
and I'm just timing this on my iPhone
while I do the transfer so I've got 29
seconds 29 seconds and 29 seconds to
transform I one gigabyte file so I'm
going to go ahead and assume that's a
chipset limitation on large file
transfers on the as media controller
however I got a hundred and twenty five
megabytes per second on the goflex with
the Wildfire SSD so let's assume that
that's pretty much the limits of what we
can achieve with the this USB 3
controller and then next we have 67
megabytes per second on the one are on
the muskan ventura pro remember that's
the USB 3 stick and finally 50 let's
call it fifty three megabytes per second
on the drive with a hard drive as
opposed to a solid state drive okay so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change motherboards here change
platforms going to switch over to my
Intel platform we're going to test the
USB two for reference as well as the
Menace ass controller which you can see
down there somewhere right there alright
well I'm done most of them so I'm just
going to run my last test here and I'll
talk a little bit about the results that
I've seen so far while it's running so
yeah it's not sophisticated but yes this
is actually how I'm testing and I press
stop when it's done transferring so here
we go so I've tested the NEC Renesys
however you pronounce that I have no
idea controller you can see that okay a
few things become fairly apparent right
off the bat here number one is that the
wildfire is not a bottleneck for any of
these interfaces I mean we're we're not
even seeing anywhere near the limit of
what that thing is capable of doing next
is that the Venturer pro seems to max
out around there we go it's done so that
took Oh surprise surprise 37 so that'll
be around 27 megabytes per second okay
so these are all in megabytes per second
okay
so the venture of pro is limited to 67
megabytes per second because you can see
these two controllers are both capable
of higher numbers up to 125 or 111
megabytes per second with the goflex
interface on the Wildfire drive okay
down here you can see that with the
mechanical drive we don't see any higher
than these are both 53 megabytes per
second and we can also see that the a75
USB 3 controller is bottlenecking pretty
much every solution here the USB 2
controller performs consistently with
all of them because once again it is the
bottleneck not the drives themselves and
the Renaissance one that appears to be
the limit because we see that the goflex
wildfire performs better on the as media
controller so that as media controller
is actually looking pretty darn good my
results are not scientific and they are
not accurate to within point 01 of a
megabyte per second these are all
approximate numbers so take them with a
grain of salt but there you have it the
Renaissance controller is approximately
four times faster than USB to the as
media controller is about another miam
you know ten percent faster than that
and then the a75 controller seems to
bring up the rear here as far as the USB
three controllers go so thank you for
