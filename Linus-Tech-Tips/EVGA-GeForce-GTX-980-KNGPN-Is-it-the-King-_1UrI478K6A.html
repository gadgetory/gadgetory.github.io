intrigued by the release of the GTX 980
kingpin from EVGA due to the
announcement of the Titan X there was a
lot of discussion in the comments as to
whether or not this card would end up
being worth it compared to the potential
price increase of said Titan X well now
the Titan X has been out for a while
let's see how it stacks up
Intel's new some 50 series SSDs utilize
the nvme standard providing speeds we've
never seen before our consumer storage
drives click now to learn more first up
we have the cards mojo its performance
hardware EVGA is front-running gtx 980
is rocking a stock base clock speed for
the 2048 CUDA core equipped GM 204 chip
of 1304 and a boost clock of 14 18 EVGA
has increased the standard set up of 4
gigabytes of 256 bit gddr5 memory by 10
megahertz resulting in an effect of
seven thousand and ten megahertz
compared to the reference card seven
thousand regards the unboxing experience
of a kingpin card is usually quite
awesome and this was no exception
it came solidly packed with beautiful
foam all over the place to the point
that I could actually repurpose this for
keeping other cards safe and nice in the
future for standard accessories if you
have a driver DVD which you can throw
away because you can just download it
from the Nvidia website a multi-language
manual and OC guide and a whole bunch of
other pamphlets and papers and whatnot
it also included a small army of
adapters including mini DisplayPort to
full DisplayPort mini DisplayPort to
HDMI mini DisplayPort to DVI VGA to DVI
dual molex to 6-pin and a pin to dual 6
pin the kingpin is massive as it should
be standing a fair amount taller than
the rest of our other kind of reference
style GPUs the backplate is absolutely
beautiful and should fit in amongst
basically any design scheme it even has
little cutouts to feature some of the
badass-looking hardware on the back also
you may notice that it is mostly calls
itself classified all over the cooler
but never fear there's a little cutout
on set backplate revealing the kingpin
branding on the PCB now EVGA expects
people to be interested in water cooling
this card and because of that they did
something that may seem a little weird
at first but it's actually really cool
taking a look at the i/o you can see
there's a DVI port an HDMI port and
three mini display ports and note that's
it no full-size DisplayPort and
specifically all of these are on one
line which is awesome because if you
water cool this card you can turn it
into a true single slot card due to no I
being on the second row freaking cool
the cooler features dual 100 millimeter
double ball-bearing fans with 11 blades
each just above an extremely large heat
sink rocking five massive straight heat
pipes and one bendy one
it features EVGA x' memory and mosfet
cooling plate plus which they claim will
reduce memory temperature by up to 7
degrees Celsius and mosfet temps by up
to 8 degrees celsius the MMC p comes in
two pieces so if you plan on cooling the
GPU directly you can continue to use the
mosfet cooling part of it a nice touch
the EVGA claims that their a CX 2.0
cooler will perform 26 percent cooler
and 36 percent quieter than a reference
card and in our testing was able to
impressively keep this card at a
relatively cool 70 degrees while
overclocked and under heavy load we
still don't have an acoustic chamber yet
so I can't tell you exactly how loud it
was but even when we made it suffer it
wasn't very annoying and it was
relatively quiet all the time yes that
was essentially the same result that we
had with the classified 980 which is
unsurprising as it's essentially the
same cooler this is beastly enough that
EVGA has the fans not even running while
it's below 60 degrees straight from the
factory if you want to learn how to do
this on your own
check out Linus's video here the kingpin
takes 2 8 pin power connectors and one 6
pin power connector along with a beastly
14 plus 3 phase fully digital vrm
sitting on top of a super solid 12 layer
PCB if that wasn't enough for you they
also have a three-stage bios switch
including normal overclocking mode and
ln2 mode along with thermal sensors
onboard voltage check points et baz
support and obviously the most important
thing full LED color control allowing
you to color match it to whatever your
build theme may be just before we get
into the performance section I'd like to
remind you guys of a few little nice
tech pieces that NVIDIA has left inside
including things like SLI CUDA GeForce
experience and all the new stuff that
was introduced with the GTX 980 like mfa
a dynamic super resolution and delta
color compression which you can learn
more about in Linus's original 980
launch video by clicking here or
possibly even here
overclocking the kingpin was definitely
more interesting than a reference 980 as
there's a lot more power and thermal
Headroom to play with I hooked up a
multimeter to the voltage check points
and used EVGA is classified voltage tool
to increase voltages to an actual of
1.35 volts which resulted in a lot more
available power while maintaining a
wonderfully low temperature of 70
degrees Celsius and a power readout of
385 lining this card between a reference
980 and a Titan X in terms of power
which is exactly what I expected after
setting the BIOS to overclocking mode I
cranked the power limit up and increase
the core clock by an offset of 135 and
the memory clock by 200 you can check
out all the settings for this card and
other cards in the overclocking dock
linked in the description down below
there was also no surprises in terms of
performance it edged out the 290x
vapor-x and left a fair gap between
itself and the reference 980 but still
trailed by quite a bit when compared to
the front running Titan X also something
to note here if you didn't watch a
performance review of Grand Theft Auto 5
is that while both these teams did
release a driver specifically for this
game it seems to favor the Green Team
quite a bit so keep that in mind when
looking at these numbers in conclusion
this card is quiet cold and powerful a
great combination is it worth it well
technically if you're going for
performance per dollar no but you
shouldn't really be looking at a kingpin
card if you're going strictly for
performance $4 anyways so I'll say it
definitely depends I could see this card
bridging the gap for some people to go
from here to a Titan X it would cost you
about 250 to 300 dollars plus or minus a
lot depending on your region so if it's
in the budget for sure go for a Titan X
but if you want a bit more than a 980
but don't quite have the budget for a
Titan X which isn't surprising as a
Titan X costs more than my first car
this may be the card for you alright
guys you guys think this card slots well
between a 980 and a Titan X well it is a
980 so above a reference 980 and the
Titan X let me know in the comments down
below like dislike subscribe share
follow any other buttons that might be
around the video
in the description you can see things
like cool Linus tech tips shirts I think
we're finally going to have an actual
Linus tech tips branded one soon so that
could be cool also in description you
can see the overclocking dock and
various other things over on the forum
you can comment there and I'll have a
much higher likelihood of actually
reading it also you can see our support
us link where you can see more of our
merch more of our our supporters and
sponsors and whatnot and you can see how
to change your Amazon affiliate code
which helps us a lot also become a
contributor on the forum that's like the
best thing in my opinion anyways thanks
for watching I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
