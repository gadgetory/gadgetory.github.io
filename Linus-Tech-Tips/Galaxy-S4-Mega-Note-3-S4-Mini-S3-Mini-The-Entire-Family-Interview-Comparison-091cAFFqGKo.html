price from Samsung you have the entire
q4 lineup of Samsung smartphones and
phablets and smaller smartphones can you
walk us through this because there are a
ton of new products here
sure well Samsung has always been about
assortment and what we try to do is line
up you know based on what customers want
from a usability point of view and also
with of you to say the pricing plan and
options that customers are going to
happen as things are changing in the
industry - your contracts tab lands that
sort of thing we're kind of developing
phones that kind of fit into those those
sort of slots I guess is the way to put
it so for example we have the Galaxy s3
mini and this borrows a lot of the
industrial design look and feel of the
galaxy s3 but in a smaller form factor
which from a usability point of view and
from a price point of view lets us get
to you know a really solid entry level
LTE device which is really what we were
thinking of here
and you can see that a lot of the same
functionality that was built into the
galaxy s3 will be built in into this one
in terms of its usability and navigation
which was a very popular phone so people
are pretty familiar with the s3 at this
point I think it's safe to say what are
the differences sure so I think what
you're really giving up on this is a
four inch screen versus the 4.8 it was
on the galaxy s3 and from a resolution
point of view you're basically down to a
720p kind of idea rather than saying
full HD resolution so those are really
the major trade-offs ok what if I didn't
want to you know make trade-offs in
terms of speed or you know I wanted the
latest form factor and I wanted the
latest ID I wanted the latest hardware
but I have small hands sure well again
you know we're about device democracy so
we have one for you so that would be the
galaxy s4 mini where again that the
trade-off is really on size and versus
the galaxy s4 so you have essentially
the same functionality built in
but in a sort of the galaxy s4 and what
we think this will go is for a little
slightly higher and you know user who's
probably paying a full data plan and is
interested in in sort of a full LTE
based phone but one it's something that
was a little smaller and easier to
handle for one-handed operation so in
terms of snappiness responsiveness and
performance am I really giving up
anything you know no you're not really
giving up anything for the Galaxy s4
mini in that regard speaking of not
giving up anything let's move on to the
Galaxy mega what if I didn't want to
give up anything on screen real estate
right well you know this product is
probably best understood as a voice
enabled tablet and you know really if if
you really can only have one device and
you wanted to have sort of the larger
real estate for multi window
functionality that you had on let's say
the note and you and you but still
wanted to be able to make the occasional
phone calls and this is the perfect
phone for you so let's go ahead and just
just for just for fun here in our b-roll
let's hold up this is an s4 mini I can't
see the mega hold on keep that keep that
bear hold that thought this is an s4
against the mega and guys this is a note
3 next to the mega so it truly is mega
and every possible way here now speaking
of the note 3 the mega doesn't really
have the fastest hardware in the world
but the note 3 does can you tell us more
about this one that's right so the note
3 has the latest and you know kind of
the latest hardware we have is 3 first
of all has 3 gigabytes of RAM on board
and has a quad core 2.3 gigahertz
processor it has 13 megapixel camera on
the front let's say versus 8 and 2
megapixel on the on the front it's it's
just its capabilities are a little bit
stronger because it has a better
Hardware background ok now tell us about
the enhancements that have been made to
the note 3 with respect to the S Pen
Stylus sure and you know what we wanted
to do was we noticed that you know in
terms of making the pen even easier to
use so really the three things are first
of all being able to quickly access
utilities that we think people will want
to use when they're using the pen
be able to jot a memo quickly be able to
open a second window or search or
capture the screen that's one of the
ideas the second idea is for those who
under you know who have been using the
note will know that you know
occasionally they had to put the note
down and use their fingers to do things
like access the back button that's now
been corrected and the third aspect is
being able to when you're in any of the
note applications be able to access
mammals quicker or menus quicker so
things that used to take two or three
commands now take one or two commands so
those are really the three primary
improvements on the s-pen so you talked
a little bit about who you expect to by
the galaxy mega but maybe break it down
for us in terms of the rest of the
lineup who do you expect to these to be
the right devices for let's start with
the note three sure that well I think
the note 3 is going to be a high-end
user that's using a lot who really
values the real estate and is really
giving their smartphone a workout so it
could've because it can support multi
window multi function application asus
battery absolutely and also from a
creative point of view being able to use
the pen which is a different user
experience I think they'll really really
like that part of it you know I think
the s4 which we have in the middle here
is still going to be kind of mainstream
you know for those who who still want
cutting-edge hardware and are you know
sort of cutting edge hardware in a more
conventional package maybe I'll put it
that way but still value Samsung's you
know Super AMOLED screen technology and
higher end performance these other
devices the mega that I talked about
earlier this is really for the value
shopper that can only you know that only
wants one device so this is the you know
rather than having phones and tablets in
a whole collection of devices this is
the one device that you could say it
could be essential so will cross over
between tablet and phone and these other
ones I think will appeal to the
navigation you talked about the size for
example being a challenge and you know
being able to use things when handedly
or if you know if you just would rather
have a smaller package and this is going
to be for you awesome I think that's
absolutely fantastic Ken thank you very
much for walking us through it thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
