for an update on the wife PC as you guys
may or may not recall I rearranged the
airflow configuration because I was
trying to avoid the default config which
is these fans blowing out and these fans
sucking air in I was of trying to avoid
the default configs tendency to
accumulate dust rings on the front fan
grill so what I've first had planned to
do was create a positive air pressure
environment but that didn't really help
because anywhere where air was being
drawn in I was still getting that that
dust accumulation so what I've gone with
now is a single intake at the back so
that is running off of the CPU fan
header with a voltage reducer in line so
that it's running nice and quiet and
nice and slow actually the sound you
hear right now isn't the fan but
actually it's the coil whine from the
GPU because I have fur mark as well as
prime95 running right now so that you
guys can see what the temperatures are
like the fact that it's off the ground
also helps a fair bit in terms of
accumulating dust inside so it's uh yeah
far less far less likely far less liable
to do that so let's go ahead and open it
up I'll show you guys what the guts are
looking like these days so I did end up
changing the motherboard oops there goes
the Wi-Fi antenna oh well whatever
so I didn't end up changing the
motherboard right now I've got an MSI
z68 AG dat in there nice high-end board
I robust cooling on the voltage
regulator modules is good because I
don't have a whole lot of cooling
otherwise in this system so the two top
fans are disabled bear off and there are
no fans in the front so that is how I'm
keeping those dust rings out and I'm
maintaining the positive air pressure
just by having just one intake fan and
it might be positive it might actually
be more neutral because this is also an
exhaust so this is pulling heat away
from
the GPU which is running quite toasty
but nots to be expected it is running
fur mark which also has a single 120
millimeter fan running on the
aftermarket cooler that is on there so
that is pretty much it there's nothing
really in the front of the case that
needs to be cooled all we've got is one
SSD in here there are no hard drives
this system relies 100% on network
storage for its mass storage you can see
the configuration of that video card so
there's a bunch of hietzing somewhat not
all over if that's a 5870 it does still
have a what is in there
it's a 2600 K as well as 8 gigs of -
Edition ocz memory and azam tech X
mystique that's an older PCI sound card
as well as a gigabyte Wi-Fi bluetooth
card in there as well so the config
hasn't changed much I just redid the
motherboard I unplugged all the fans I
switched the power supply around so that
this would act as an exhaust for the hot
air coming off of the graphics card
because that's really really toasty and
I didn't want to blow it the other way
up towards the CPU cooler because
especially in a in a heavy load
environment running the CPU passive like
that is is pretty pretty tough it's
really asking for a lot now bear in mind
guys the system is not overclocked in
any way sorry I'm just adjusting
something there I want to close this up
here before I show you guys any more
hold on I'm just going to let the camera
hang for a bit I apologize if this is
like motion sickness inducing because
there's just nothing else I can really
do with it right now okay their case is
closed up because I want to show you
guys on closed side panel temperatures
when I show you the prime95 fur mark
temps better going on in here so again
the system is not very loud not coil
whine you hear is from the graphics card
will turn off when when we turn off firm
art for mark really does a number on
graphics cards and I found especially
the last few generations AMD cards ah
well if they wanted a little bit alright
here we go
so CPU temps with 8 threads of prime95
are around 60 degrees which are
super acceptable and fur Marc's been
running for the last little bit here and
it looks like we're going to peak around
that sort of 76 to 77 down to 76 a look
at that good timing we just hit the peak
right around right around the time that
we stopped that we stopped filming here
and I stopped talking about it so you
can see now it's really balanced itself
out a fair bit so I think that pretty
much covers it so the 5870 is more than
happy running at around 75 80 degrees
under load and if we go ahead and turn
all this stuff off so if we stop our
torture test
put that away turn off firm art you're
going to see that idle temperatures are
very very good as well so like I said
wouldn't recommend overclocking like
this but if you have a case that is well
ventilated in terms of just allowing
passive airflow to go through it you
know heat does tend to rise a little bit
you can get away with very few fans so
there's only a few fans okay here much
quieter now that was that quell line
from the graphics card before so very
few fans 120mm are sorry 140 ml here 120
ml in the power supply and then that 120
ml directly on the video card and that's
about it I mean if you didn't have a
video card and you have like a passive
power supply like like this x-series one
from C sonic here you could get away
with just a single single cooling fan
blowing air towards the heatsink and
that's about it remember guys that CPU
is technically not a hundred percent
passive because I do have that nearby
fan blowing air at it so I think that
pretty much covers I think is going to
be a while before this settles down into
and into an idle reading here but
whatever you guys get the point thank
you for checking up this update on my
video blog and don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips oh yeah for those of
you who are definitely going to ask
that's the fractal design arc midi case
love it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
