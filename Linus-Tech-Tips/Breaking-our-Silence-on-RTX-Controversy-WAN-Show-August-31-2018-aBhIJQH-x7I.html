really really scary Wow
because theoretically we are live on
both twitch and YouTube o at the same
time do we even have the engine power
for that yes we do we have very much and
it's called
computer processing power because one
does not go live on the internet with an
engine you're thinking of driving down
the road oh but that's ok I forgive you
for being not quite as technical I
thought for sure it was engines I don't
know well how many cores past where it
is for this ok I managed to guess it yay
all right I have a special guest co-host
today ooh it looks like we are live on
Twitch so that's good
but I have no idea if we are live on
YouTube and because I don't really watch
youtube videos I actually don't even
know how to find out if we're live on
YouTube I guess I could go to the
dashboard and view the channel yes my
friends say this will be the first week
theoretically yes we are we are live
right now Wow Wow Wow so this is the
first week that we are live on both
twitch TV and YouTube and we had a lot
of our viewers express concern that
twitch was going to kick us out of the
cool kids club and they could very well
do that but unfortunately there just
isn't a whole lot that we can do about
it
so we we had a couple of options there's
there's a service that you can use where
you can you can push to this external
service and then it will propagate to
all the different services that you want
but being the big nerds that we are
around here what we ended up doing was
putting a virtual machine on one of our
servers that runs an rtmp server so it's
some nginx thing and then what's that is
that Anthony ok I thought I heard
Anthony's voice and I assumed there was
some kind of catastrophic problem cause
on the lookout for an Anthony or two
yeah cuz he he basically he he and Jake
actually worked together to get
everything set up for this week
and going to twitch I knew - yes and we
didn't have it working as of one hour
ago
oh when because something to do with the
nginx config basically the way that we
determine which services were streaming
to is by copy pasting a particular
string into the server and we copy
pasted the wrong thing there's something
apparently it's not like there's no UI
for it it's all just Leshem and line
there's a spellcheck yeah there should
be thank you that's me right there's on
the wages on the contribution I don't
know how much he actually knows about
the topics but I looked at these at all
yeah but but he's pretty so hey that's
what qualified him to fill in for Luke
and James both of whom are not here
today that means a lot coming from you -
you're very welcome
so so anyway so we're live on both
twitch and YouTube which there's
actually there's like there's different
encoding settings that are optimal for
each platform so basically what the
server does is we stream into our server
and then our server encodes it in the
most optimal way for each platform while
also recording a local high quality copy
of the original stream for itself and
then the machine that we're streaming
from so in this case it's this box right
over here the one that we we actually
did a video on it we built our like
corsair RGB man show streaming pc a
little while ago right so that is also
gonna save a high quality local copy to
itself so the idea is that we are
streaming to our multiple services and
we are saving at least two original
quality copies at any given time so we
shouldn't run into a situation again
where we are going to where will will
screw up and we'll lose the lan show
which actually hasn't happened in a long
time but it had happened at times in the
past
well that sounds real fancy yes thank
you you are you are enjoying the
heckling is protecting yeah well no now
I get to the tables have turned
haha no no they can't see you
so on don't give me swab but because
he's really got a redo it was supposed
to be like a Simpsons intro thing
theoretically I should honey fresh books
average turkey I will I will talk in
more depth about our sponsors on the
windchill aid honey fresh books Savage
Turkey it sounds like the beginning of a
rhyme but I welcome you know what I kind
of want to find the old intro and show
it to you guys
here it is when intro dot MOV oh no
these are some very old Apple makes em
Oh peas you don't want to play those you
know what should I you know what let's
do it let's do it let's uh good wild
yeah we're we're gonna go through we're
gonna dig through the land show folder
on the server whoa we're gonna find us
some assets here just buckle in strap in
boys and gals hey no this this could
actually be cool don't make fun of me
this is neat so we're digging through
the archive so here's the wine show ah
so here's the intro yeah there we go why
don't we adjust the size of these these
here these here thumbnails there so
here's the swamp intro so this is the
one you're probably familiar with I'm
just gonna mute my computer here yeah
there we go so there we go so that's the
one that you're familiar with but there
was a few people probably remember this
but there was a version before this when
intro oh gee Oh what where this he's
walking he's walking and this is and now
there's there's a trapper scene that
yeah so but that's the same so Ed
actually I think powered by Razor come
oh wow that everyone still uses so so ed
actually revealed this I think in a oh
no that video is the GPD pocket - is
that live yet yes it is so ed revealed
his secret I don't know if I actually
made it into the final cut of the video
but he was like yeah the way to use
copyrighted artwork is you turn it into
pixel art and I'm like also is that
pyramids thing so those pyramids are
actual pyramids oh it's yeah so these
these are actual pyramids I mean good
luck ever figuring out what picture this
is an actual wall those are the real
pyramid yeah and this is a real spike no
there's not a real spike that would be
pretty spike although that would be a
pretty impressive program that could
turn a picture of a real wall of spikes
into yeah into that yeah
so so that was that was Ed's like
mastered like deception so he was like
oh yeah we could do a new one like all
the time this takes like 30 seconds to
just steal artwork and then pixel art
I think somebody would have caught on
eventually Yosh a medal yeah he doesn't
want us to call it stealing sorry
borrowing with style Wow
Toy Story reference okay cool this isn't
stealing its borrowing with style that
would be a very different movie if that
was what the actual line was so we got a
lot of great topics for you guys today
and also some pretty mediocre ones I
think the US courts say that price caps
don't apply to areas with only one is P
we have a lot of notes on that also this
is a rumor there's a lot of hearsay here
that Nvidia will be controlling there
Adam Bortner partners controlling their
ability to seed the upcoming r-tx cards
to the press through driver distribution
and Tom's Hardware I wrote a real funny
article it's hilarious oh yeah it was
hilarious if it was on their onion yeah
a lot of people thought it should have
belonged on the onion that's for sure
what else we got GlobalFoundries halts 7
nanometre development it's a big deal
they've been on the leading edge of
for a while and now they're not AMD has
moved to tsmc for all of their Wawa okay
so normally we do the intro after we
introduce the topics for the day but
clearly that isn't going to happen today
because we already ran it we could
already have fun but we've already run
it a couple times if you were paying
attention I'd already have gonna fly
yeah um all right so why don't we jump
right into how are you I'm good
I've actually hardly believe it or not I
I see Riley very little yeah
honestly this is when you're like or
Colton was like are you gonna host the
wine show today I was like with Linus
like I haven't even like talked to him
the whole time I was here basically
we've had like little conversations yeah
we had a couple meetings and then like
at the beginning where a lot of you
probably noticed there were some some
issues with some of the early episodes
of tech linked like I think the very
first one that I'm the heckler I'm just
like talking like every 10 seconds it is
well very annoying
we were figuring out yeah you know the
format and whatnot yeah who's heckling
trying to find the right dynamic yeah
that wasn't it there was also an early
one that now this was this was a really
frustrating story because do you
remember the one where we miked up the
heckler yes okay so we had a lot of
people like quite literally everyone
watched it we had a lot of people not
like that the person off camera was also
miked up yeah so it created this weird
like disembodied voice right and I think
it was too too loud in those episodes it
was too loud because I think now where
is we don't have the person the heckler
miked but it's also that like you can't
really hear them that well silly we
might I was I was gonna talk to EDS all
about like miking them but like making
it's quiet
I don't know well that was the intention
that time yeah we never intended for the
heckler to just sound so so I
specifically asked Dennis I said hey so
I'm miking myself up now yeah it was me
so I'm making myself up today to be the
heckler but I need to make sure because
we don't want it to be like like like
they're also hosting the video right
I need to make sure is it quick for you
to add reverb and turn down the volume
right so that it sounds like they're
off-camera he goes oh yeah no problem
I go oh good and then I watch the video
I'm like what we never did it so you're
blaming Dennis for this Oh 100% oh I
asked him the next day he's like oh I
didn't have time and I'm like don't boy
dennis is a dennis is a pure soul don't
so I'm sitting here going I asked you if
it's quick mm-hmm that's why I asked you
if it's quick Co because I knew you
wouldn't have a lot of time what we
would need to do is just set up another
boom mic but that's my work yeah
but then it's like we have two mics on
one set up we can't afford to do that
yeah we actually can we actually have a
couple of ntg-2 so that's - it's way too
crazy I don't think we've used them in a
couple of years to get the bike out of
the package put it on the stand
it's just don't get me started you know
what's really funny is when Linus media
group first started I would I would go
into the NCIX studio mm-hmm and I would
be very envious of all of the equipment
that NCIX tek-tips had that was just
like strewn around and random just in
general like there was so much gear what
are you what like completely I mean in
the early days yeah like when Linus
media group first started I thought you
were talking about like when I was there
I was like we have one camera two lights
right
we owned one microphone meanwhile NCIX
tech tips had like wireless microphone
isn't like this high tech stock oh yeah
NCIX at the forefront of yeah yeah and
and then and then it was it was just it
was fun the contrast at the end there
when I when I went to the NCIC auction
felt like good you're like walking in
you're like your guys's primary
microphone which was I rode ntg-2 right
that's right yeah your guys's primary
microphone was sitting there up for
auction oh yeah up for auction I wanted
to go to the auction and I was like oh
quaint and ntg-2 I remember those NT 2
and T 2 are NTG
any ntg-2 whatever pretty sure ntg-2 I
think it is ntg-2 okay good
well anyway anyway I was like oh quaint
we have a couple of those I don't think
we've used them in a while in a file Oh
perhaps we should have we could have it
as an antique Oh perhaps we should buy
it it's you two still really good and
perhaps we should buy their employees as
well yeah have a well Ivan oh yeah
that's right we have Ivan although he
didn't strictly speaking work for the
tech tips team what the heck did Ivan do
he was actually helping with a lot of
scripts yeah end of the what's even
getting paid for that oh well I don't
know who's getting paid to do his job I
don't know if that was like strictly
part of his job description but he
definitely helped a lot especially with
like graphics card reviews and stuff
right
yeah love that guy so how's it going at
linus Media Group I don't think we ever
did a mid-year review for you yeah we do
we didn't you know what did we that's
probably the longest conversation we've
had is one need you oh
performance oh okay okay okay so how's
it going are you happy I'm very happy
you can tell them that you're not happy
it's fine
well now I'm stressed because this is
like another mid reroute review right
now no I'm having a great time honestly
it's really good to be able to do the
tech news code type of content again and
make stupid jokes and yeah it's been fun
I get to heckle you wait no I was I've
always heckled you yes so that's a
little more stressful is that now I'm
getting heckled as well yeah I used to
be able to do the show by myself and
like have known it like they're all
behind the camera like they can't say
anything it's so funny so back in the
NCIX tek-tips days I never watched their
show so the only time I would watch net
linked was when I was on it because I
wanted to see like the goofball ways
that they would edit it so you guys
would have because I you guys might not
might I don't know I don't know if you
guys watched or not but what was kind of
cool about NCIX tech tips was that we
shot it on what was effectively a blue
screen so what that meant was there was
a lot of creativity in the editing where
you could like take something that was
done in the show and you could easily
move it around
manipulate it and blow it up and shrink
it so so that was that was that was
actually a really cool thing about do so
many things it was sort of accidentally
on purpose and I can explain the
rationale behind why the entire NCIX
tech tip studio was a new screen and
agrees you had a set first you had like
a background yeah look like a TV on it
and stuff and then we kind of moved away
from that and we went to blue and green
screen paint even right like the the
Rosco stuff yeah anyway so where was I
going with that right so I would never
watch the episodes that I wasn't in so I
had always thought that the heckling
because they would always give me crap
when I was hosting the video and I would
get and it's kits came about because I
would give them crap about things I
didn't like about the script or things
that I did like but I just wanted to be
mean to them and but and then they would
dish it back to me and it kind of became
this this fun dynamic you thought we did
that all the time
I thought I thought it was like a
fundamental part - so anyway Riley comes
in and hosts I think it was your first
tech linked oh my gosh and I start like
saying stuff that was horrible and he
just like stops so Riley's like saying
something and I'm like oh yeah you know
your mom or whatever the first the first
video that I was on with you you were
hosting it and then her we were hosting
it together or something and I just like
didn't understand how to do things or
did you do it for my first episode you
did or maybe it was your second one or
some things I don't remember that at all
maybe I was out of the office for your
first one but no there was one where I
yelled stuff and you just like you just
froze up every time and you would like
are you gonna edit this out or and and
so what do you would do is he would stop
and he'd go back to the beginning of the
paragraph because he's like trying to
think of what his comeback is or when I
had you yeah yeah yeah yeah here yeah
that happened here just like are you
doing what I don't understand I there's
a script I'm supposed to read the script
I only know how to dish it out I don't
know how to take it that's exactly
right that's exactly what the situation
was so yeah it's been it's been a lot of
fun kind of finding our finding our legs
I think a couple of the episodes last
week including one of the ones that I
hosted we're just awful
but we're still finding our rhythm I
think actually the one that I hosted
last week was the worst tech link that
I've hosted yet
well apparently speaking of twitch the
one that I hosted where it's like or
steam TV yes is twitch like that
wouldn't well I don't I didn't do well
anyways yeah I don't think that's it the
funny thing about about twitch and game
streaming and I think we talked about
this before bits like I don't blame a
video about twitch and or game streaming
for not doing well because it's one of
those things where like if you're into
it then you're like oh yeah twitch yeah
which is huge
I love twitch and then if you're not
into it I mean and you're the kind of
person where I'll be at like a family
reunion or something and I'm no and what
do you do and I'm like oh I make I make
videos on YouTube
oh so you work for Google even if they
even know that and I'm like yeah no I
know I don't they're like oh so how do
you get paid then I'm like well you know
how busk you know how on TV like babe
there's the commercial yeah okay like
that okay it's definitely like I've told
people that I make videos as a job a few
times yeah they're just like and do you
just do that for fun or yeah yeah sure
yeah you know realistically you know
what I could do something else I could
bus tables so yes I'm doing this for fun
it's that bad well your feet hurt
you're on your feet a lot should we
really I was only a busser only bus
tables I didn't graduate to being a
waiter I want to know the story here why
did they not let you wait tables oh I
don't think I ever want I didn't think I
ever asked for it specific so he just
never aspired to more than bussing it
was Olive Garden do I understand it
correctly
have career aspirations at Olive Garden
I see but well is this as much to do
with Olive Garden being one of those
places that kind of has a policy about
who waits the tables well and what
gender they are and how much boob they
have hanging out oh no no no all of
gardens not one of those I don't think
so okay so it's not early thinking of
hooters
no no yeah a lot of people's I did not
know that's not what I mean
no I mean you've been to like cactus
Club oh yeah yeah no Olive Garden is
like they wear like ties and stuff
they're very formed like the I will
confess I don't think I have ever eaten
it all in Cardin - tell it let me tell
you something free breadsticks and you
get a free and you get a soup or salad
with every entree okay do you still work
for all of you are you secretly are you
a spy do you get a free soup with your
are you a secret informant unlimited
breadsticks it's very bad for you in my
secret informant yeah okay so your bust
tables
mmm never graduated never finished the
program and you know what I would like
you to talk about the other job that you
actually still have oh yeah why just
because I think I think people would
like to go and get their fix of Riley oh
man okay okay so Riley actually only
works here part-time not because we
weren't willing to hire him full-time
but because he actually has another job
Wow as a secret informant
I'm not the secret informant you aren't
I know and this is not the real site
it's not the site no it's can we try
going to tattle calm remember its tattle
now Oh secret informant sounds so much
there you go so this is the actual site
I guess okay tattle calm so the TAT
separate informant though yeah secret
informants the show sacred Foreman's the
show the company is tattle
this is some of the episodes and some
other things you know what I where's my
favorite one the one where you try like
jujitsu or something
oh that's probably not on here you have
to go to the YouTube channel just click
on a video really click on this and then
go to videos okay it's gonna be there
you go here we go this is Aikido this is
my favorite episode these ads skip aah
Oh take that Briley yeah so this is so
basically this show is I had there's a
secret informant from like a given
culture this is Miho she was the
Japanese secret Foreman so we went and
did a Japanese thing and it basically
just like I learned something about the
culture usually it's eating food but
this episode was me doing a martial art
that's what it is
it's this really you trying your best
look I was half laughing this entire
time because it's like a very very
serious it's a very very serious
discipline and I was like clearly like
not like they're stretching I'm not very
flexible they're like rolling and stuff
I'm a big lanky awkward white guy it was
great so I was kinda the instructor was
white that's not the instructor anyways
yep check it out if you wanna watch
Riley get thrown around for 10 minutes
it's like actually awesome oh man ah
that's one of my favorite moments yep so
yeah I'm here Monday Wednesday Friday
though yep season 2 is out now right
it's coming out it's coming to here in
Episode four now go for three yeah
anyways this is a tech show this is
about tech news yeah that's the theory
but when show is actually far less about
tech news than you might think
yes now that you're on it do you see how
little about tech news it actually you
know this is my second time hosting I
was on with James yeah that time I think
we were like we got to talk about the
news kno I kno that I'm on with you I
see that I don't care about technology
at all I care about technology
I don't care about the news secret
informant mm-hmm um okay so we do
actually have a couple of pretty big
topics to talk about this yeah what do
you what are the big time for everything
this was posted by RC mail on the forum
the original article is from ARS
technica comm and this is some pretty
pretty Garbo looking stuff that we got
going on right here so the FCC basically
according to a US Court can define
markets with only a single Internet
service provider as competitive which to
me means that basically that court
doesn't have like it's not the court of
using the dictionary court you know yeah
like it must be a different kind of
court it's kind of like the court in
Harry Potter when they go and they're
convicting people for you know for for
bad reasons you know - I actually
rewatched the entire Harry Potter series
not very long ago so yes so there's no
what I'm talking about is they say it's
there if they say it's not there so then
they can say well then you're not right
I which and if they say it is theirs
then they can save their like I stole it
and then right and convict them of
stealing so they can either convict them
of not being pureblood or whatever or of
stealing or whatever or they asked them
who they stole it from you went way
deeper anyway Dolores Umbridge is a bad
bad person you might say she's rich ha
ha yep get it cuz I got it she's a witch
anyway so an appeals court has upheld an
FCC ruling that broadband markets can be
competitive even when there is only one
Internet provider so logic the original
FCC decision was appealed by competitive
local exchange carriers and purchasers
of business broadband including sprint
and windstream it's actually a little
more nuanced - than it sounds though so
this decision eliminated price caps in
any given County if 50 percent of
potential customers are within a half
mile of a location served by a
competitive provider so the FCC's
position then is that nearby networks
can close the half mile gap expanding
into the areas in question so in theory
if that raining single ISP is charging
too much for service then that
neighboring competitor should be
financially incentivized to expand into
the area man this is like really market
sorts itself out typo yes so the FCC
cited evidence that some competitors
will build as far as a mile out and said
that most of the buildings at issue are
far closer to competitive fiber than
half a mile mile the CLE sees position
is that it's often not feasible for
neighboring ISPs to expand into these
areas and then the FCC argued that the
CLE sees petitioners studies inflate
costs by selecting the most expensive
build entirely underground lines Pratt
presuming that a separate lateral line
for each into the presuming a separate
lateral line for each individual low
bandwidth customer and treating the main
fiber ring as part of the cost of
reaching new customers rather than as an
existing sunk cost near potential new
customer so there's conflicting evidence
in the judge's ruling well we recognize
the relevant data presents radically
different pictures of the
competitiveness of the market depending
on the economic theory applied in the
weight given to the conflicting pieces
of inference but the FCC may rationally
choose which evidence to believe okay
too bad so they have denied the
petitions for review as to the
competitive market test because the
FCC's resolution of competing evidence
was not arbitrary and capricious so
basically even if you only have one ISP
to choose from your market can be
considered competitive because there
might be an ISP within half a mile that
could build out to provide service I
think that's really where the core of
the issue lies is like if you have one
is be to choose from you have one ISP to
choose from it's not competitive just
it's like saying that you don't actually
have a choice well it's like saying that
oh there's lots of competition here when
there could be competition in the future
you're you're acting as if a future is
here already
so I mean this is a really frustrating
issue because on the one hand
I am pretty free enterprise in general
I'm a capitalist but the problem here is
that while you can make these sort of
free-market capitalist sort of arguments
for why there shouldn't be a bunch of
regulation on what the major ISPs can or
cannot do how much they can or cannot
charge their customers you can make
those arguments but the problem is that
that ship sailed like a hundred years
ago hmm what do you mean at least maybe
not a hundred years ago that ships you
know not the Mayflower but the ship of
having an unregulated market for
telecommunications has already sailed
I see so now have regulations so you
have to regulate it because building up
that infrastructure was a joint
enterprise between the private and the
public sector so because there was a
public investment in it there have to be
public rules and that infrastructure has
to continue to serve the public it's
already a done deal
yeah and besides the alternative having
just any Tom Dick and Harry be allowed
to start their ISP without regulations
and you know build put down fibre lines
right or run copper wiring wherever they
want it's anarchy I mean that's it's
like when you go to a developing nation
and you look at a telephone pole and you
go my goodness that is a fire hazard
because there's so many different lines
running every which way there's no
there's nothing to keep it under control
yeah when you actually don't necessarily
need that much if you've got cooperation
of the companies that manage these lines
and you've got a regulating body sitting
over top making sure that everyone is
playing fairly I mean I also I also see
the argument from the perspective of
like hey we should like set it up so
that these companies are incentivized to
expand their network and make things
better but the problem is is that like
you said well like you said there's
already regulation and also internet is
way more of a crucial part of everyday
life life yeah 2018 so it's like these
kind of rules I think are definitely a
little backwards thing and the other
issue with these with the sort of the
market argument is that it makes a lot
of very optimistic assumptions about the
way that businesses will behave so the
free-market argument for well there's an
ISP nearby surely they could build out
another half mile of fiber in order to
access these customers so you could say
well surely that's the way that a
competitive company would behave right
except that it might not be it might
actually be much more profitable for
that company to say hey we got a
monopoly over here hey but you keep your
monopoly over there we'll keep ours over
here yeah neither of us will invest in
any new fiber and we'll each just charge
more because who you gonna go to and
then they do one of these and I mean you
saw something similar happen with the
with the corporate tax breaks that
recently happened in the u.s. like look
I'm a business owner I would love if our
my corporate tax rate was 21% it's a lot
higher than that that would be super
cool for me um who else would it be cool
for the theory was it would be super
cool for the customers and the employees
who would definitely get those savings
passed along to them in practice what
we're really seeing is a lot of stock
buybacks do you know what stock buybacks
do they don't lower the price of the
product for the customer so I can pretty
much guarantee you that the new iPhone
tenth that Apple unveils on September
the 12th are not going to have a 10%
price break mmm guarantee you that one
um
take that to the bank they do not go to
the employees there were a couple of
token wage increases that did occur but
by and large that has not been the trend
that everyone gets paid ten percent more
so what a stock buyback does is it
creates a shortage of the available
stocks for that company because they are
effectively buying their own stocks and
stocks the pricing of a stock is
entirely controlled by supply and demand
so if a company is running out and
buying back its own stocks what it is
effectively doing is increasing the
value of the stocks that are already
held by shareholders so the shareholders
are making money bearing in mind of
course
that any money you own in stocks
is-is-is paper money it's theoretical
money until you actually sell it for our
currency but then again currencies can
fluctuate far more these days than a lot
of people would be comfortable with so
you could you could again make the
argument that paper money is also just
just pay just paper money then you know
maybe we should all just go back to gold
I mean ya know going down a rabbit hole
but the point is many of the
stockholders the shareholders for these
large publicly traded companies are the
executives that works for them so who
ended up getting paid when a company
like and I actually know what I'm not
going to use any specifics because I
can't remember off the top of my head
any that have participated in a great
deal of buying back of stock but the
people getting paid are the people who
own shares and some of those people are
members of the general public but this
was pitched as some kind of a boon for
the everyman and as a business owner I
can tell you anyone out there who's
trying to make the argument that
business owners were going to take an
extra an extra double-digit percentage
of effective profits and and just go up
in their Zeppelin and go and throw it
out of this throw it out of rain it down
on the people on the downtrodden yeah
it's an idiot that's not how that's not
capitalism works that's not what I would
do right and that's not what anyone else
would do because that's I'm what I'm
kind of confused about is what is the
what what is it in it for the FCC right
yeah well done it for them by by making
this ruling because obviously it's good
for the ISPs this is where the
government's interest in doing this this
is where the rabbit-hole quite frankly
goes a lot deeper than I'm familiar with
because it's like I don't know the
intricacies of the way that all of these
agencies interact with each other and
there's a lot of people that I kind of
look look at what they're doing and I go
what's motivating you to say the things
you're saying right now or do the things
you're doing right now like are there
are there pictures of you like with
goats like
like I mean very compromising very
compromising photographs notes
yeah like naked
you know like shaved goats and like
whipped cream all over the place like I
just look man if somebody wants to hang
out with whipped cream and goats that's
that's fine you know as long as everyone
everything's consensual you know what I
mean
I just I I look at I look at the things
that these people say and the things
they do and I go you love hanging out
with goats you know you've got an
education from Harvard or Princeton or
whatever presumably basic fundamental
like using your noggin a little bit and
as part of the curriculum there
so clearly you don't actually believe
what you're saying
so so what what are we doing here you
know like how are we doing this um
anyway we should probably move on yeah
why don't we move on what do we do some
speaking of getting paid sponsor spots
so fresh books is the super simple to
use invoicing tool that actually does a
lot more than just help you create and
send slick-looking invoices it lets you
track your time with their timesheet
function manage your expenses and it
keeps helps keep track of who owes you
what it's also got a feature that tells
you when your clients look at your
invoice for the first time so say for
example you were a contractor yes you
could use fresh books in order to send a
bill to the people who you contract to I
wouldn't have to fill out the excel
sheet myself actually no you should you
should probably work into fresh books
the mobile app has all the functionality
of their desktop version so you can take
fresh books with you wherever you go and
if you have any questions you can reach
out to their support staff where you
will talk to a real human no phone tree
no escalations no return calls just
answers so go to fresh books comm slash
man and claim your free trial today okay
I will I actually don't know if you've
twisted Yvonne's arm into doing all the
work for you but if you are actually
doing all this stuff yourself you might
want speaking of things to look into
honey for those of you who don't know
what honey is it's a delicious
that you can pour on pretty much
anything and it'll make it sweet and
yummy Wow make it it's a free breath no
they don't huh
wasps what wasps don't make honey bees
make they learn like serious they look
like they were you serious right now you
thought no I think actually that was a
joke but I think wasps do make their own
type of honey but it's not very good
wasps steel honey they're in large
amounts making access to a beehive you
know but they are carnivores feeding a
lot of our babies eat if they don't make
honey feeding on larvae and small
insects they how those of you that don't
know what honey but for the actual what
the honey sponsor thing is don't stop
backpedaling wasps do not in fact store
any food on their paper like combs are
only used to rear wasp larvae you don't
even have like a little bit no not
according to the Guardian comm anyway
what are they you know they're from
England
okay so honey is a free browser
extension available on Chrome Firefox
and Safari if you're some kind of chump
and you use Safari and it's and it saves
you to actually safari is okay the only
thing okay look I don't use the thing
that bothers me about Safari is that
their tabs this shows their tabs don't
show favicon hours-long what data cons
you know favicon news look these it's
the look on little icon - the screen
yeah yeah so favicon is the little icon
that indicates what the crap website
that is at a at a glance right okay so
and he already doesn't have that that's
true it's just very irritating it's just
great when when when Lauren has a bunch
of tabs open I'm just like what do you
how you yeah how do you do anything so
if you're a tab monster like me it's
very frustrating
anyway anyway back on topic honey it's a
browser extension okay it's it I don't
have the thing I'm getting flustered
here okay oh it's free okay you save
money online and over 30,000 stores it
works on Amazon eBay Newegg razor Best
Buy Walmart and more honey gets a small
commission from the sites okay for
referring you right and then honey saves
you money so you don't have to pay for
it at all it's always free
it's casually a no-brainer day yeah
we've we've had some
of our staff here switch over to using
honey Colton and Brendon I think have
saved some money already shopping online
and basically what it does is it finds
the best coupon and the best deal and
automatically applies it to your cart
yeah boom
so don't notice it the rest of it so get
honey for free right now join honey calm
slash Linus and it is be honey not wasp
honey it's whatever honey you want you
know likewise you can't tell people what
kind of honey they can have and not have
but what I can do because you are on the
land show if I can it yeah you're not
our vegetarian are you no good you sort
of said you were a vegetarian because
you're gonna try the Reaper today and
I'm just gonna heat some teriyaki
because are you into spicy
spiciness when it's like part of the
flavor and when you just like take
something that's not naturally spicy and
then like make it ridiculously spicy so
Javed jerky is made with the best
ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives with the goal of creating
a snack that's full of flavor and spice
but that isn't matching they've got 13
different flavors my personal favorite
is maple buffalo bacon sriracha Bacon's
good know anything boho is good the
traditional is really good
they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce
and a spice rub and their Carolina
Reaper hot sauces is one of the hottest
peppers in the worlds actually really
nice I tried it on the show last week so
you guys can use offer code ltte to save
10% on their products over at savage
turkey what was that believers really
nice it was that like it was very spicy
but oh you recovered from that faster
than I expected its burnin still it's
working it's doing it's doing the
devil's work but it's I mean it tastes
good I think for people who are like
crazy into spice that's a good one yeah
not all the flavors are so spicy yeah
brother can I help you oh oh Knicks
bugging me about responding to some
super chats
when I'm I'm gonna read them I'm gonna
read them I really should have had the
twitch open but now yellow havoc says my
first live web show
thank you guys for all the hours I've
spent watching no no thank you for the
hours you've spent watching because wait
the hours that you've spent watching we
you're thanking us for that no no no no
yeah yeah wait okay thank you yellow
havoc um okay why don't we actually do
at least one more tech topic here
because I really wanted to talk about
this rumor ooh
so this was posted by eighth and
immortal on the forum and it's
originally from hard OCP is it juicy
rumors you see rumor no and the article
basically says that nvidia is
controlling the ability of at inboard
partners so that's your a soos is
gigabytes EVGA x' of the world msi
they're controlling add-in board
partners abilities to seed RTX cards to
the press for independent evaluation
through driver distribution I thought
you told me you didn't want to talk
about this now we could talk about this
okay I didn't think it was great for
tech linked because I think it's a
little bit more nuanced right and we
have time in about okay whatever
so a comparison is being made here to
the GeForce partner program we're in
Verdean video was exerting control over
their AI B's and OEM brands right with
the GeForce partner program so now it's
exerting control over who the EA Bay AIB
can have review their own custom cards
so Nvidia has asked that the AI B's tell
Nvidia who will be reviewing their
custom RT X 20 80 and 20 80 TI cards and
they have asked for reviewers email and
phone numbers so like they want to know
who specifically from that publication
will be reviewing it yes interesting so
with the list of reviewers have been
submitted to Nvidia and then NVIDIA has
put together its own list of approved
reviewers and sent their approved list
back to let them know who they are
allowed to sample cards too so they are
not allowing the AI bees to distribute
drivers with the review cards for a
reviewer to have access they must sign
in videos multi-year NDA login to portal
to obtain the driver and download from
there onto a machine with the new r-tx
card present
is like a whole nother level of of kind
of sketchiness because it's not just
Nvidia telling reviewers who can review
their cards it's Nvidia telling the card
makers who can review the card makers
cards ahead of lunch right so honestly
nothing here really raises alarm bells
for me we signed in videos NDA we talked
about this on the land show before
there's nothing particularly odious in
there like it's it's a pretty
bog-standard NDA the same kind that we
would have to sign with pretty much
anyone the same kind that doesn't
prevent us once the card is out there in
the public from saying everything we
want about it like it's you know it's
has stuff in there about not
reverse-engineering the product and like
all the same kind of thing if you were
to get a sample from Apple Intel AMD
there would be a very similar NDA to
sign and Bayer driver download portal
they've been using that for at least a
couple of years now so that's not new
and you already had to provide Nvidia
with an email address and a login so
that they could authorize you for the
portal we've never had trouble getting
that going so I got first glance this
seems like whoa this is legally if he or
whatever not even legally if it just
practice in practice normal the only way
that Nvidia the only way Nvidia can
enforce this is for pre-launch reviews
and it is very typical in order to avoid
leaks so this is but this is only for
before launch yes once the card launches
anybody can grab it and do it of course
of course yeah you could go to the store
buy an RT X whatever the crap and review
it do you want me to do that no I don't
because we're gonna have Anthony do it
because he's far more qualified okay so
this is one where I you know on the one
hand I I've given Nvidia flack many
times many times at least a dozen times
about what I call their cloak-and-dagger
BS around their launches and not talking
about the comics where no no we're we're
basically you know they'll do stuff like
they'll invite us to an event but we
can't tell you
you know what's gonna be there or you
know whether you should bring a camera
operator right or and I'm kind of like
look it's a graphics card okay what what
day are you giving us the actual
information do I need a camera operator
there is there gonna be an internet
connection can I live stream is there an
embargo lift does it lift immediately
when you guys announce it or does it
lift the next day I need to know this
information so I can do my job but line
is it it might not just be a graphics
card it might be a fully new you know
experience yeah sure tracing my
frustration with them for the most part
is that I want to be able to do my job
with the flip side being and I've had
the same conversations with AMD Intel
pretty much you name it
and so my frustrations are probably like
I think they're fair but then I also
understand the other side where they
can't they can't run around or they
can't have people who are not getting
briefed on the product correctly
who might be running you pre-release
hardware and or pre-release drivers who
don't necessarily understand the full
story because it is actually important
to get a briefing on something that's
not out yet there might be stuff that's
not working yet but the fix is coming
hey guys
don't test that till the day before
we're gonna have something for you but
it's not quite there yet
that's also why you don't really want to
pay too much attention to all these like
leaks benchmarks that come out and stuff
because it's like they're probably
running on optimized software and the
other issue is that part of this full
control over the launch thing that these
companies do is about creating a fair
and level playing field so if Nvidia
were to allow someone who is not
authorized to review the RT X 2080
or the 2080 ti if there were two if
there were to be some way for that
person to get a card and a driver ahead
of the launch that website or that
YouTube channel that publication could
go live with a full review right that
may or may not be based on actual
finished software so might paint the
product in an unnecessarily either
positive or negative I mean there have
been situations where performance was
greater right and then had
something had to be fixed that ended up
negatively affecting performance so
people might not be getting an accurate
representation of the performance and it
puts everyone else who's playing by the
rules
and releasing their their reviews once
the NDA lifts at a disadvantage because
everyone will already at least think we
know how the product performs so
basically saying put yourself in Nvidia
shoes and maybe consider if I wouldn't
say that but I wouldn't mind being in
Nvidia shoes how many billions of
dollars revenue
ok well but but consider for a second I
mean like they are a big company there's
lots of big companies that act in their
own self-interest but like consider for
a second that there is a decent you know
reason for them doing this kind of thing
I'd like to know what did it what is it
that I ignored during my read ignore -
ignored the whole chat with his rant oh
yeah sorry
somebody said let Riley rake make a
review video just kidding
um you don't want me actually I think
Riley's gonna be working on an l TT
video in the near future working on
we're not gonna tell you guys exactly
exactly what's going on so anyway final
conclusion Nvidia controls AIB launched
totally get it I wish that review
embargoes weren't a thing at all perfect
to be perfectly honest with you I wish
that they just said okay here it is
here's the product here's the driver
right go that would be ideal but I also
understand why companies feel like they
have to do this crap
however frustrating that might be for me
as a member of the media GeForce Partner
Program was terrible basically terrible
this is not that this is it's it's far
less terrible it's it's very annoying
hmm but potentially necessary uh well no
I don't think any of it is I think it is
necessary for NVIDIA to protect its own
interests right okay well necessary not
necessary like for things like this to
exist in the universe it is this is not
especially helpful for consumers getting
an accurate
understanding of the performance of the
product Wow but that's because the
drivers aren't there yet unless they are
see in this case is there I don't have
an RT X card right I don't have our TX
drivers I know I don't I don't know how
done or not done any of this is I don't
know who we're getting our TX cards from
I don't know when they're coming no for
real
I'm serious so I'm just I'm just so so
I'm just saying like all of this stuff
is very frustrating very annoying and we
wish it wasn't a thing but for whatever
reason companies do this stuff and in
videos is not is not that much worse if
any worse than what other companies do
it just it just kind of is what is your
Nvidia Stan Nvidia Stan
yeah is that a country is it is it fully
illuminated
Stan is like a you know what if Stan is
like if you're a Stan of the country no
no no that's like oh you Stan Nvidia
Stan yeah so I go on the internet it's
an internet term okay like a fan sure no
yeah yeah I know so you hate in video no
what no it's nothing in life is that
black and white oak I mean we've been
accused of bias every way which is which
is great my favorite but this is my
favorite thing to read hmm I'm going
through the comments on a video and I
got one comment why this clearly was
Intel biased in this video yeah and
literally the next comment is Wow his
AMD bias is on display for the entire
world
I'm gonna go on your bias yeah you're
biased for both I think we're riding it
just right at that point as long as yeah
as long as like people people are always
gonna agree you're biased but if they
can agree that you're biased for
everybody then I think then I think
we're doing a pretty good job nice now
who's not doing a good job this was
originally posted by rascal over on the
forum and I I actually - I want to say I
deserve credit for getting this article
huge cuz I tweeted this like right when
it came out I saw it pop up and I
tweeted it on the tech week
count and then like an hour later gamers
Nexus put a thing up so I was like okay
yeah I'm sure right on my coattails
bringing it to the attention of the
public I'm sure that given all of the
understanding that you have of how video
scripting and and editing and encoding
and uploading works that that they
surely did see your tweet yep and turn
out that video in one hour what can I
say for sure for sure gamers Nexus did
that I can't believe this article is
still up yeah you take it down you think
this page this page Tom's heart broke
calm / news / Nvidia r-tx GPUs worth the
money comma comma three seven six eight
nine HTML you would think this page
would redirect to a gigantic we're sorry
at this point so it is clearly labeled
opinion piece yeah but honestly I read
through it and I thought it was like a
parody because everyone everyone says
when new graphics cards and stuff are
announced Hey okay but wait for the
reviews you know it's like hold on you
don't want to be wasting your money on a
new car is announced yeah a new game is
an especially games but but like don't
pre-ordering and then and that's what
everyone saying and then Tom's Hardware
it's like just buy it I got a hot taste
so their defense is paper thick so this
was written by their editor-in-chief to
like that's just brutal you know I will
say like Tom's Hardware seems to like
most of the time they have pretty good I
don't know I find it oh I don't I don't
go there like a ton but like when I do
go there it seems to be like a decent
site that I was like good opinions
decent for getting like a spec sheet
right okay so this is good they actually
have added a note here as with all of
our op eds the opinions expressed here
belong to the writer alone and not Tom
Tiber as a team this article is a
counterpoint to Derek for us equally
worthy see that kind of makes sense why
you well cuz it's like oh we can't be
worthy not okay it's not equally worthy
this is worthless we encourage readers
to check out both articles form their
own opinions and share feedback in the
comments section below
oh yeah fair enough but it's fair of
them to
emp'd some sort of like
point/counterpoint type thing firing
line if you will left versus right you
know no let's let's have a dialogue this
is a bet this is one of those okay so
just like just like the conversation we
were having earlier where I see
arguments being made out in the wild
that I just go you know are we are we
really talking here yeah re are your
earholes kind of are they working you
know are they is it making it there
what's going on here like this is the
kind of argument that you you can't you
can't make yeah it's it's it's dumb
it's bad like it's got it's actually got
a subheading called the real cost of
buying outdated tech like the cost
there's not a cost of buying outdated
tech my my or did you scroll past that
that's my favorite line right there when
your whole life flashes before your eyes
how much of it do you want to not have
ray-tracing like what's the point what's
the point of living without ray-tracing
are you quitting bezel is done what's
that are you saying bye okay bye I'll
see you I'll see you at the airport
right Airport okay are you on the same
plane as me do people know where we're
going
I don't know oh yeah so so this is fun
um anyway should say this article is
laughable and it is undefensible
undefensible in defending whatever Nick
make it cannot defendable it cannot be
defended you should never buy anything
without without independent evaluation
or like trying it first like that's why
you test drive a car that's why you
don't just pre-order a roadster to
Rafina or whatever it is and then you
see PC Gamer actually it's not linked in
the in the yeah in the description but
did you see that article no I did you
see gamer actually put up he he was like
he referenced gamers Nexus and he
referenced Tom's Hardware and he's like
okay but hold on a second what about
this what if there's a return policy and
you're like I want I know I'm gonna get
this card I know I'm
then go for it so what if there's a
30-day return policy and you have like a
thousand bucks to drop and you don't
care so the problem with the IT industry
and this was true at our old employer as
well is that a lot of the time there's a
there's like a restocking fee like
returning electronics like graphics
cards is not necessarily as simple as a
pair of pants at the gap or whatever so
as long as you believe that you can get
rid of it and you have the disposable
money sitting around fine but that
wasn't the argument because the problem
was that this argument for doing that
it's just buy it just try it
like when I'm 99 years old and I'm lying
on my deathbed yes and I'm thinking back
and I'm saying like oh my gosh I didn't
have ray-tracing for six months what was
the right choice deep learning that's
the other big feature right are the ray
tracing and ELSS yeah um there's a bunch
of other topics this week but you didn't
know that
um Lego built a life-size drivable
Bugatti from over a million Technic
pieces yeah that's pretty cool you
should probably go check that out
bippity Boppity is something along Libi
blah blee bloo there you go yep I mean
it doesn't go fast of course cuz it's
you know made of Technic but it looks
really cool so that's pretty sick like
nice job guys yep and now what ah
there's pictures leaked of the iPhone XS
yeah we talked about that our tackling
today 10s excess of 10s I think think
it's gonna be 10s so which is that I
would say that's kind of annoying to me
because OS 10 like it's it's used you're
right it OS X but at least there's no
other numbers in there well there's no
other numbers in this one wait s is not
a number but that's fine
oh you're right um and I guess that uh
that leads us to the end of the show so
on the subject of getting tax breaks and
not spending it on your employees Linus
media group actually did get a big tax
break and is actually spending it on all
of its employees so over the next week
or so you're probably going to notice
some
differences in our content lineup - tech
tips videos will continue to be
published throughout all of next week as
we'll tech quickie videos but tech
linked and the LAN show because they are
same-day productions are not going to be
going up next week because well I mean
how do you do it yeah the entire team is
taking a vacation and all expenses paid
vacation - should I say where we're
going I don't know no I didn't say it
weird people gonna show up you know what
let's say where we went after we get
there yeah I love that I might have
already said where we were going I don't
know we are heading into the ether
anyway we are we're going to do a
corporate retreat because we are
spending a bunch of we're gonna blow a
bunch of money that we got is a big tax
rebate for being a media production
company in BC on our staff doing
something fun and team-building and it's
gonna be great I'm actually super so
yeah so we're gonna have some fun and so
there will be no an show next week so we
will see you in two weeks two weeks oh
yeah wait right yeah okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
