however there is a very good reason for
it this is the ocz vertex okay you've
heard this before but wait there's more
limited edition okay so this is a
limited edition drive it is a 200
gigabyte drive that I'm going to be
unboxing today which seems like an odd
odd number 44 an SSD because typically
what we've seen in the past is 32 gig 64
gig 128 250 at cetera et cetera but no
this is a 200 gig it is a high
performance design with NLC flash memory
am more on this in a minute trim support
and raid capability but let's go back to
the back of this Drive okay latest
groundbreaking solid-state taking shape
in the limited edition okay you can
probably read that if you pause it so
I'll let you do that if you want to this
is where this Drive separates itself
from the crowd reads up to 270 megabytes
per second totally unexceptional right
up to 250 megabytes per second we have
not seen an mlc flash drive capable of
anywhere near this kind of a right speed
with sustained writes up to 235
megabytes per second so that means that
there's a little bit of a trick this is
not another in the links based ocz
vertex drive this is based on an
entirely new controller called the I
could get the package off I'm actually
not sure if I'm allowed to say exactly
what it is but i'll say that it's made
by a different vendor one that we've
been eagerly anticipating the
controllers from and it the initials are
s and F okay so if you if you know too
much about SSDs in fact you can probably
google it all right let's get this thing
open here but the way that they achieve
this high level of right performance is
through a compression algorithm that
actually writes far less than you're
actually telling it to now that means
that the controller on this drive is far
more complicated than an indolent
controller but it is able to achieve a
high level of performance without
expensive flash so it's a bit of a
trade-off okay so
with an installation guide how to
prepare your drive before use more
installation guide formatting and your
limited warranty which i believe is
three years on this drive but it looks
like it doesn't say that here must say
it's somewhere yeah there it is three
year warranty on this particular ocz
product so the vertex limited edition
actually you know what I'm gonna do
something unprecedented and I'm just
going to kind of put this down and I'm
going to let the cameraman look at it
for a second and I'm going to step out
of the room and go get another prop one
holding I'll be back yeah I hope that
was really interesting I'm back just
closing the door I wanted to compare it
to the older vertex okay so there we go
basically it looks almost the same you
can see that the label is slightly
shinier because vertex is now shiny and
limited edition is shiny they're both
say 22 so that means that we're not
going to be moving beyond the
approximately 270 megabyte per second
overall bandwidth limitation of a SATA 2
controller they're the same thickness so
that means they're going to be
compatible with pretty much 99% of
laptops out there they feature mounting
holes on the sides as well as on the
bottoms of the drives the bottoms of
these drives actually look pretty much
exactly the same you can see the part
number is slightly different this is a
vtx le whereas the older ones are just
vtx and I think that's pretty much all
there is to say about it the vertex le
comes at a price premium you can see
that we've got aceite to interface here
say 22 power stata to data but you are
getting the fastest MLC performance on
the market today and that is why this is
worth unboxing even though we're just
looking at another black SSD drive from
