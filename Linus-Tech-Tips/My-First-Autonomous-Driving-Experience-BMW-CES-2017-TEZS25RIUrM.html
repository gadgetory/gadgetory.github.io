features for BMW that were going to be
enabled through something called the
open mobility cloud and his sculpture
phase video but I I am going to try it
in real life
Brad and I went on a wonderful drive
with a prototype BMW 5-series connected
car
when first getting into the car it
automatically syncs your calendars
shopping accounts entertainment and even
the schedules and locations of your
friends by accessing the open mobility
cloud or OMC this will let your car
automatically plan your navigation and
list your schedule for the day on your
dash along with a few other things that
we will discuss in more detail in a
moment once you start driving a lot of
monitoring and management is happening
behind the scenes if you receive a text
asking you to meet up OMC will scan the
message find the meaning of the message
and then ask you if you want to accept
the invitation if you do so it will add
it to your calendar and plan your
navigation accordingly at the same time
OMC will be giving you information about
the duration of red or green lights in
front of you so you know if you need to
wave and for how long it does this based
on a database of information on all of
the red lights in your city that is
gathered through working with the city
and the observations of various other
connected cars from both BMW and other
OEMs but moving into the backseat for a
moment there's a passenger that was
watching a movie last night on Amazon
video but went to bed partway through
OMC knows this and offers to keep
playing it for them from where they left
off when they accept OMC puts the car
into a cinematic mode changing the
ambient lighting and putting up a screen
in the back window to lower display
glare now this this was super cool we
entered something called convoy mode in
this mode you can set your car to
automatically follow the car of a friend
of yours in front of you then you're
free to do whatever you'd like as the
car drives itself this was the first
time that Brandon or I had experienced
automated driving and man it is a wild
feeling while the car is driving itself
it's constantly checking for street
signs that will display speed limits or
Road information that will help it along
the way it will sync this information
with other connected cars so that they
can all move around safer and more
in formed if it encounter something
unexpected it will take itself out of
automated driving mode and let you take
back control it achieves this
awesomeness through a mixture of cameras
ultrasonic sensors radar and an HD map
along with their ever-evolving OMC data
while it's doing all of that
epic information juggling you are free
to sit back and hang out I'd suggest
even taking their gesture controls for a
spin pointing your thumb to the left or
the right will give you context
information about landmarks that are
around you pointing at the screen will
have that information read out to you
and swiping your hand will well you
guessed it swipe it away you can even
use the built-in Cortana functionality
by pressing the speech button on the
steering wheel and doing something like
asking for dinner recommendations it
will automatically suggest some
restaurants based on your preferences
and reserved seats for you if you tell
Cortana a time that matches up with your
already existing dinner plans it will
intelligently pick the right amount of
seats and update that calendar entry
accordingly and of course that goes
along with updating your navigation
plans that you can get there on time
speaking of navigation if you forgot a
gift for your dinner date you could
order one on Amazon now and the open
mobility cloud would automatically
optimize your pickup location based on
your current location and the path that
you will be taking for the rest of your
drive in doing this it will make sure
that it is as little out of your way as
possible through a system called BMW
connected on route delivery once you
arrive your car will have a good sense
of where you can park due to the
real-time on street parking information
that it has been gathering through OMC
this whole time and on arrival there
could even be a little robot valets you
can just get out of your car the robot
could show your car where to park and
then the car would park itself that's
pretty wild</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
