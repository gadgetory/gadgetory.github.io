little unusual because I don't have
anything nope we had a special guest
this is Michaelson and he has brought
with him the h MC Galahad a 3d printed
dad the kinetic sculpture robot whatever
you want to call it that if you factor
in his labor and even a mere twenty
bucks an hour is worth over seven
thousand US dollars
Tunnel bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you use the web as
though you are in one of 20 different
countries learn more and try total bear
for free at the link in the video
description let's start with a breakdown
of that cost because to print something
to this degree of quality and at this
size would require a 3d printer costing
about a quarter million dollars about
$3,000 of that cost of the machine went
to Shapeways there's about another $200
on the cost of the electronics that run
the whole thing including the 18
freaking servos not to mention the
vibration motors and all of that stuff
and then by my rough napkin math about
$4,000 of it is in the detailing which
we'll get into in a little bit more
detail later in terms of other key specs
the HMC Galahad has six legs six
genuinely moving legs by the way
including access hatches doors and
windows all of which open its got 24
guns along the bottom half of its egg
lake structure most of which are
anti-personnel type weapons then it has
an additional nine guns in the top half
including two very very large cannons it
has searchlights on the top that
actually move and are also capable of
being shuttered just in case you know
you don't want them to get shot out by
an attacker or whatever the case may be
and it includes even amazingly cool
little details like check this out
there's a service staircase or an access
staircase for someone to get up into the
top rotating turret which I guess leads
us pretty well into a tour of some of
the other immaculate details that went
into the creation of this well think
it's all in a product because mr. soon
has only created two of them so far the
main gun here which actually fires by
the way is rifled on the inside of the
barrel if you come around to the back
you can see we've actually got some
soldiers that are that are that are men
the HMS Galahad here when these engine
smoke goes there's actually some
lighting back here it's got a seven
point four volts Evan hundred million
power battery that is enough to run it
for a while
but it doesn't deliver enough current to
run everything concurrently so all the
switches back here allow you to run
certain things but not others because
this is more of a demo than anything
else moving around over to this side
check this out
just these little things are so cute
these are acupuncture needles right here
that are acting as a little antenna here
and of course I've been glossing over
the fantastic weathered War worn rusted
paint job that's going on here that
accounted for something to the tune of a
hundred and eighty to two hundred hours
of the construction time the actual
assembly only took a couple of games
function number one we're going to put
the gala hat into what I'm going to call
century mode there we go and what you're
going to see is the top turret is going
to start to slowly rotate looking for
our target when it sees a target look at
that it fires next up we've got most of
the rest of the guns
so most of the ones along the bottom are
on vibration motors so they look like
they got that firing action but some of
them actually have a similar firing in
Bank sort of mechanism going on the
Gatling is on the left rotate
realistically and the right arm gun this
one's cool this one actually has a
recoil action that includes the legs
moving as well demo number three yes my
friends it walks although I don't know
if walk is as appropriate a term as
lumber would be I'm going to wait look
at the right moves the whole thing
shifts around very cool which leads us
to the big finish which as you guys
always know involves the biggest gun and
the largest load this
well it's a ping-pong ball but it looks
like a cannonball right here and fire oh
there goes okay the angles need to be
tweaked a little bit we get that but
there you have it folks this is the HMS
Galahad
by far the coolest and most expensive
robot toy kinetic sculpture that I have
ever seen
