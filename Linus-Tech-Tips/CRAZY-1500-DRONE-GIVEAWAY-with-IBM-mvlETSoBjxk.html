it's sponsored by IBM which is a first
for us that's pretty cool and I have no
idea what's going on so it's meant to be
very experiential and Alex here is going
to be showing me exactly what is inside
these black boxes and why they are so
very cool
okay so what do we do first then just
open one okay so okay you bad unboxing
for now just like hey camera here's the
thing you were already looking at very
very much already and you know it's just
gonna kind of hang there oh oh this is
great
if only you could see if only you could
see what was in this box yeah this how
it's amazing okay it's inside you will
find an IBM developer sticker coaster
really it is not you've got this cute
little Telo drone it seems to be like
pretty capable and like even if you
don't win one you can get them for like
a hundred bucks or something like that
oh speaking of winning right that was
one of the big things for this whole
video is they're actually giving away
1500 of these kits so you can check out
the details below will tell you a little
bit more about it later but for now
let's just have the experience here so
here's our battery for our Trello drone
the since it's more bad it's more
battery now than drone twisted and well
not evil but pretty cool anyway you've
got a special code to unlock access to
IBM's code pattern to help you program
your drone you get a medium sized to IBM
developer shirt alright this one's a
large oh that's a fire and you control
it with your phone
I guess yep iOS and Android yep cool
nice wallpaper thank you thank you
Kelvin hops wallpaper okay so we're just
joining the Wi-Fi hotspot from this
drone yeah you just connect to Wi-Fi
then you get in a little app so takeoff
so let's take off yep
is it black and white oh no it's coming
at me oh yeah would you like me to fly
it do you know how to fly a drone you
can't screw up flying a drone you can
and people do yes I'm just trying to
figure out how to oh yes
that's what I was trying to get okay
this is really good at doing flips do
you want to have a little girl sure like
it's pretty standard drone functionality
but that's really stable for a tiny
drone I guess I should expect no less
from DJI but okay no it's bad alright
okay so we can land it for now though
right yeah how does IBM figure into all
of this so that's the really cool part
about this little drone is that it's
super easy to program so what are we
going to program our telephone to do
we're gonna give it a little routine
kind of like go up move one way the
other way maybe do like a little square
and then a couple flips oh cool let's
start Oh Fred it's pretty simple but it
looks pretty hackery you do need to know
how to use command a little bit okay and
are we connected to the drones hot spot
right now are we on the Internet we're
just on the internet right now okay but
where did you go mr. drone there we go
hello so a flow one Tello missions
yay so this is just a really like visual
drag and drop programming interface but
then can you can you go straight full
hacker writing things out if you want
oh yeah like every one of these is like
an actual bit of code and you can do
kind of whatever you want in it cool so
let's just see if it's working so we'll
just like hit take off wow that is too
don't hit the light please
so if we could we just can we bring it
to psych down a bit
can you override with your phone or like
how does this work are we reading
computer is that okay that's all we go
down how much 60 60 centimeters probably
I hope so if we go to the right let's
just get it a little bit away from us
yeah so that was right 30 want to go
right 30 again 10 out of 10 10 out of 10
best way to fly a drone 2018 okay I
wonder what full 360 does okay okay
that's pretty self-explanatory it's a
good thing that this has a nice stable
flight okay yeah man okay okay cool so
now we program it to do something yeah
let's just run this little code and see
what happens
so it goes down does a 360 and then
lands
splendid yeah that did work then we
could have it we could have it fly
around the room probably right I'm gonna
go get a tape measure 50 actually here
why don't we do you want to take off
from the floor instead just make our
lives and maybe a little bit easier
command zero 1000 so that must be for
the takeoff then we'll have it go up
maybe another 50 centimeters so that's
about head level so instead of down we
want to go 500
then let's go clockwise 90 was 19
so we're kind of mapping out where we're
expecting it to go and then we'll see
what happens let's fly in a straight
line 220 centimeters can we do that 201
to you okay okay and see if it lands on
the table we're asking for a lot here we
understand that yeah it does this
doesn't have a bottom facing camera does
it it does have IR so something like
that not a camera yeah yeah okay well
let's see what happens see and then all
that we have to do to connect them is
just take the custom path and we add
this little connection here okay
successfully injected run mission
whoa what did we set it to I thought we
set it to 50 centimeters 500 no this is
in millimeters
are you sure yep I wouldn't get too
close David there goes the content it's
gonna go up ah no I am pretty sure it's
centimeters why would you have a
granularity of millimeters for something
that flies like it doesn't make any
sense
I don't know millimeters are just nice
which stop it all to like 200 yeah okay
oh it's gonna hit things
okay up 50 then we want to go counter
clockwise 90 turn come on turn turn baby
how do you get it to stop okay so why
didn't get the clockwise you need a
counterclockwise so yes let's just make
sure that that's wait did you write cww
oh it should be see see all of them yup
I did that for every single one so that
explains why that didn't work this is
pretty cool yeah
here comes the flip way yep no is it
gonna hit anything
oh it's really close to that chain that
chain it did you bring it back down Alex
okay it's supposed to land oh why is it
flipping again oh that's the flip okay
so it's gonna go forward land now
so there you have it the only limitation
is your imagination and your competence
so that's like pretty cool and all but
yeah you know kind of just for like
playing around with programming and
stuff yeah
but the actual like powerful part of
this is the vision recognition stuff so
basically you can send imagery to Watson
yeah it can like take a little look at
it and then tell you what it is yeah Wow
so like it's pretty cool for like us and
like the IBM guys had it like go around
and like find their dog or another dog
related thing he has a bunch of tennis
balls that he always loses in the yard
so the drone just maps out where all the
tennis balls are that he threw for his
dog more like there's useful things like
you never go up and inspect a cell tower
or like wow look at like powerlines and
make sure they're not all clogged up
with icing right so now this is
obviously not the unit that you would
necessarily use for all of those types
of applications but what it is is it's a
great affordable learning platform what
I was trying to do was to get it to find
either you or Colton and attack you but
unfortunately I wasn't quite able to get
it to work so we had a train on a
negative which is pictures of like me
James
Pella the people in the office that I
liked you know so we have like our find
and destroy Colton thing uh-huh
we did this with 17 pictures of Colton
15 of you I just grabbed them off the
internet and if we test this if we like
take a picture of you and I was email it
to myself
drone stuff picture of Linus coffee it
in loading results oh only 59% Linus so
it does recognize that it's you but it's
not as good as the Colton stuff that I
was doing like if we take a picture of
Colton
and here's just a random one it wasn't
in the training yeah 90% and only 1% -
yeah and like I was able to do this in
like 15 minutes so we weren't able to
get full attack drone capability and
obviously for stuff like the tennis ball
or like inspecting cell tower examples
we gave before something like this is
probably not quite heavy-duty enough but
really the purpose of the Telo drone and
these developer kits is to get your feet
wet and have something that is
surprisingly capable for the price with
that said you won't necessarily have to
buy one because as I alluded to before
iBM is giving away a whopping 1500 of
these at the link in the video
description so a huge thank you to IBM
for obviously supporting the developer
community and sponsoring this video and
a huge thank you to you guys for
watching if you just like the video you
can hit that button but if you liked it
hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link below also
done there's our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you guys should
