they're expecting me to review it I
specifically told them I wasn't going to
we don't really do keyboard reviews
anymore but because they just really
wanted me to try it I mean it's some
cheap keyboard mouse gaming combo set
these are kind of a dime a dozen these
days what are you really expecting and
they were like no this is a direct quote
from cooler master of marketing we
created a keyboard that mirrors the
highly popular mechanical Cherry MX blue
switches and we made it affordable while
maintaining functionality we
successfully pulled this off with the
satisfying clicky feature on our new men
Kanaka witches but could a membrane
keyboard really replicate the feel of a
mechanical one let's find out on this
episode of manufacturers say brought to
you by thermal take thermal takes view
37 mid-tower case can support up to an e
ATX motherboard with a fully modular
design check it out at the link below to
learn more
[Laughter]
so you're definitely blind follow the
saw my boys watch your head towards me
towards me towards me there we go okay
step step I I mean you're stepping over
a cord so it's a little overkill but now
I'm gonna form my own impressions here
but I wanted to bring in someone who's
an even bigger keyboard dork than me to
evaluate this so I think I've run you
through the premise someone has created
a keyboard that they claimed at least
closely imitates the feel of a cherry MX
blue okay now as a warm-up I'm gonna put
something random in front of you and I'm
gonna make sure you haven't lost your
touch come on over here oh look there's
your home row there buddy
somewhere close enough technically it is
a Razer Orange okay yeah yeah but yes
really yeah okay good how do we make
this random enough hold on I'd like to
read you some more of the marketing
first if I can is that okay you good I'm
fine okay you haven't fun yet it's just
very face sweaty because there's nowhere
for my breath to go huh
that sounds very unpleasant I'm glad I'm
not experience satisfying clicky feature
great price full RGB and free nose so
with a mouse with a full RGB backlight
this thing is like 75 US dollars okay 50
million keystroke durability so they
claim there is no compromise they're
specially designed tactile and clicky
switches similar to those found on
professional level mechanical keyboards
its fine-tuned to help you win all your
battles oh okay
you can put all your battles I would
like to see like they should have to
prove that that you can look increases
your win right so I'll tell you how they
do it
later but let's get you let's get you to
try one of them so don't take your
fingers off the home row I will consider
that to be cheating okay okay what just
you don't you don't get to know any of
these things what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna have Brandon pick which keyboard I
am going to put in front of him okay
okay don't touch it yet
don't touch it yet okay hold on don't
touch it yet I didn't here's your right
hand is going straight to the J all
right okay I find it myself is that okay
yeah yeah yeah you can you can do the
other hand yourself I think you should
probably start by typing of what I can't
go off homeroom oh yeah you can go on
home row so don't take your fingers off
the home row yeah yeah you can do it
everyone I don't think I wonder if he's
gonna get this I don't think I need to
try the other one I'm pretty sure this
is the imitation one
all right well hold on a second let's
get you to try the other one because I
want you to have a chance to to retract
that statement in case it comes to that
okay if that was cherry MX blue the
field has changed a lot over the past
few years my keyboard is relatively old
but it doesn't feel like that I can tell
you that much okay all right there you
go go for it yeah okay you can take off
the mask now hold on I have that I
haven't tried it yet the other way
around I would like to have an
opportunity to evaluate this for myself
I mean I was I was I was mashing it so
I'm not gonna
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
it's like every single it feels like
relatively okay and then you start to
get anywhere close to bottoming out and
you're like what is that
it's stiff it feels like it feels like
in between a blue and a green in terms
of the waves cuz it's like that and it's
inconsistent a little bit yeah
towards the end it's like I mean that
wouldn't even be an o-ring that would be
like a memory foam ring that's what oh
[Laughter]
man you can probably even see the
difference in pressure like it's quite a
bit heavier towards the end the selling
point here is that they've done this
mechanical feel but without rubber domes
but it's still a membrane keyboard would
have blown my mind a little while ago
but recently we did a video on the
history of the model M and I found out
that there are actually model ends that
do use membranes but with a mechanical
key switch like it feels it feels like a
toy okay so there are some other issues
here too now to be clear this is also a
Coolermaster keyboard right here this is
just a cherry MX blue so you see that
key cap wobble there's always gonna be a
little bit you never get away from that
now have a look at this that's a tongue
this is among the most I have ever seen
yeah so hold on a second though okay
free most though in fairness to
Coolermaster yeah those are nice
switches I think those are arm runs
actually that does feel nice
would you want a game on this though no
I don't like it
I would I would rather have a good
membrane keyboard than that like
original g15 I would put that way above
there again I feel like I'm being
possibly too inflammatory but that feels
like it's trying to be something that
it's not and that makes it feel weird
because the click feels kind of fake the
bottom out is weird and squishy the
whole time I was really hoping there was
gonna be a lot more suspense
I should probably tried this before I
got you there I was I was so worried
when I had the mask on you put in front
of me was like I might have lost my
touch and then the first one I was like
wow this better not be it because if it
is Terry's quality has gone way down and
then you had him the other keyboardist
yeah short video all right go ahead and
cut well thanks for coming in and
