latest from AMD the m4 a 89 GTD Pro /
USB 3 this is an ASUS motherboard
featuring AMD's latest 890 GX chipset
and the biggest difference between the
AMD 890 GX chipset and anything that's
come before it is that it has native
theta 3 or SATA 6 gigabits per second
support also I have this cool AMD
football isn't this awesome bring your
a-game so I'm gonna throw it to the
cameraman and hopefully you can catch it
that was really lame that's okay it's
done now ok so here we go this features
extreme design number one performance
reliability and safety it is hybrid
which we'll figure out later ok it
supports am three ooh poor on Locker
this is a big one so AMD has actually
made it a little bit more difficult for
the motherboard manufacturers to allow
you to unlock dual and triple course but
as soon as seems to have found a way
around it so they're enabling their
users to do that you have support for
GPU boost crossfire X side port and
hybrid crossfire X so that means that
you can use the integrated graphics and
you can put like some kind of low end
graphics card and you can run them in
crossfire or something it seems very
convoluted and I can't imagine really
any reason you would want to do that if
you want to use an add-in graphics card
you put one in if you don't then you
don't core unlocker intelligently unless
true core performance yep GPU boost so
you can actually overclock the
integrated GPU that's pretty cool hybrid
processor turbo the Evo so ok you can
overclock with auto-tuning ok
turbo key to this is basically like the
old turbo button on really really really
old Intel processors so they're saying
that you can basically use a key to
boost your CPU performance up with one
button press 100% solid capacitors it
has mint okay which I'll explain a
little bit later SATA 6 gigabits per
second and EU p okay well long we open
this up and see if we can find more
details on exactly what this thing is so
the first thing we find inside ooh I
like these already we find sate
connectors I just like them look at
these they're black and white that's
cool and they have like a two-tone color
scheme so it actually comes with all it
only oh it only comes with a couple like
that I'm guessing these are the SATA 6
gigabits per second connectors although
any decent SATA cable will run fine
let's say the six gigabit per second so
they include two straight connectors one
black and white one black and then two
right angle connectors one black and
white one black it's gonna make it a
little difficult to have a unified color
scheme in your build but what are you
gonna do okay next we have an IDE cable
not exciting next we have all this these
are good these are the Q connectors so
you use these if you have a case that
doesn't have them in bricks and has them
all split apart to make things a little
bit easier for yourself then you've got
one of these LITTLEST sous-vide I switch
cards so I believe this is to turn
crossfire on and/or off please keep the
switch card on the black PCIe 16x lot
only remove it when you want to install
other devices okay I wouldn't mind
seeing something like that already
installed from the motherboard that's
potatoes all right then we've got the
i/o shield which has their spongy foamy
medley stuff on the back then we have
the user guide which also includes a
driver CD don't use this download the
latest drivers off the assist website Oh
chase badge shiny metal case badge
powered by a soos okay then they oh
there's info about the VGA switch card
that's pretty useful thank you for that
information of toriel document so it's
for installing one graphics card you put
it in there okay well that seems pretty
self-explanatory I'm glad they included
a little addendum to that alright let's
have a look that's a nice looking board
actually you don't see too many like
smexy looking AMD boards these days but
it looks like they've really gone all
out on this one yeah I'm gonna I'll do
that kind of angle it okay put that in
there okay so let's put the board on top
of the box here and have a look so yeah
that looks really nice so they've done a
couple things completely differently
that I have never seen before first of
all we've got these really cool-looking
vrm heatsink
we should have a look at those from the
side because they look pretty sweet
and I'm just kind of going out on a limb
here but I'm guessing because it's
labeled hybrid technology it's all about
the power savings so I'm thinking maybe
it's supposed to look kind of like a
tree like green but then it's blue so I
don't know if that's for camera man's
giving me a funny look I don't think he
agrees with me but but the Northbridge
wine looks kind of like waves it's kind
of like water which is also very
environmentally friendly so that's my
guess I could be totally wrong and feel
free to leave your comments about
whether you think I'm right or the
cameraman should be giving me a funny
look about that green stuff so let's
have a look at the general layout of
this board it is an m3 board supporting
up to 140 watt TDP TDP CPUs so that
means you can put any a m3 capable chip
in here you've got support for dual
channel ddr3 memory as with all a m3
boards that support ddr3 its dual
channel alright we've got a few buttons
up here that should be pretty relevant
so we've got the turbo key 2 as well as
the core unlocker buttons and then we
have the memo K button I said I'd
explain that later mem okay basically
means that even if you're using Ram that
requires more than stock voltage to run
memo K will automatically set all of the
RAM at like a safe setting that means
that you'll be able to post even if you
aren't running it at optimal settings
also to do with the RAM slots we've got
these cool a seuss exclusive RAM slots
that only have a clip on one side the
other side is not actually a clip so the
intention is that you just put slide the
RAM slot in that way and then put it
down on this side and clip it in so they
in theory it's a little bit easier to
install alright we've got the 24 pin
connector and it's ideal location along
the right-hand edge of the board and
this is probably the weirdest thing I've
seen on a motherboard in quite a while
the 8 pin connector is huge look at this
thing
ok so the 8 pin connector rather than
sticking about this high off the board
like we normally see I'm going to turn
this around actually sticks like 3 4
centimeters up from the board I'm
guessing that makes it a little bit
easier to access in theory one thing
that it would also do is makes it a
little bit more difficult for the for
any cabling if you're bringing it up
from the back
have a board and then up around to the
front it have to be a little longer but
most power supplies might like most
quality power supplies these days have
pretty long eight pin connectors anyway
so I guess it's not two things it was
cold outside and the batteries of the
camera died so here we are back in the
office and as I was discussing before
the eight pin is really long that is
really all I had to say about that
beyond what I have already said so we've
got also PCI Express connectors so we've
got two PCIe 16x connectors one PCIe 1x
and one PCIe 4x this could be useful if
you have say for example a raid card or
any other device that needs a little bit
more bandwidth than a PCIe 1x then down
here we've got 2 PCI I think this is a
very ideal layout because if you're
using two dual slot graphics cards how
easy this is going to be basically
you'll have one PCIe 4x and one PCI is
still available now USB connectors this
board has tons check this out you've got
4 USB headers each of which is good for
up to 2 ports or like one card reader so
you can connect a lot of USB devices to
this particular motherboard down here
this is a big selling point here
these are SATA 6 gigabits per second
ports these are native ports that means
they're running right off of the AMD 890
GX chipset ok so we've got one two three
four here and I don't really like the
placement of these two because they
could potentially be covered by a
full-length dual width graphics card
here but you still got these two
available and then we have two more on
the edge of the board which would also
be accessible no matter what one ide
port as if no I mean you know what
actually I shouldn't say that a lot of
people are still using these for DVD
drives so it's a perfectly legitimate
thing to continue to include on a
motherboard no floppy connector though
and that I can't say I'll miss so there
we go let's have a look at the back here
we have lots of different connectors
let's start at the top you've got a ps2
keyboard port then we have one two three
four USB 2.0 ports and then we have hold
on let me see if I can figure out what
oh cool this is one of those combo ports
so we actually have one two three four
five USB 2.0 ports then we have an
optical audio out HDMI out DVI out
VGA out so lots of different video
output display adapter options then we
have firewire and eSATA so this is one
of those combo USB / eSATA ports very
cool then we have a Gigabit LAN and 7.1
audio thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the soos m4a 8 9 GTD Pro /
USB 3 wait no stop wait stop hold on
there's more I forgot I just said the
name of the board it has USB 3 right in
it these blue ports their USB 3 I didn't
even say that also don't forget to
comment on the video let me know if you
agree with me or the cameraman about the
the green heatsink design that is all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
