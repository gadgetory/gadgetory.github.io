career as a as an influencer that's the
word for me apparently it's not a word
that I invented but it's one that that
brands create for you
every once in a while in my career as an
influencer I get to do something
completely off-the-hook totally unreal a
perfect example of that was CES a few
years ago when I managed to convince the
CEO of Razer min-liang tan who you guys
are probably well familiar with he's
quite a character
no plaza I convinced him to let me be
the first one to see their concept
project Kristine I believe they called
it that year their concept for like a
modular desktop system with like this
weird backplane that seemed now now that
we're a few years in the future seems to
be kind of based around the idea of
Thunderbolt 3 very forward-thinking and
those are really cool things for me to
get an opportunity to be the first one
outside of Razer to get to see it and
make a video about it but that pales in
comparison to what I'm going to be
showing today
a huge thanks to fresh books cloud
accounting software for sponsoring LTX
2017 if you're a small business owner or
freelancer
check them out at the link below those
of you in the gaming scene will probably
be familiar with this video for you guys
do you guys hear that okay now think
about this in the year since this video
went up on razors YouTube channel we've
had smart fridges smart washing machines
okay and this thing started as a joke
but think about this okay
project Fiona was a Razer concept
product okay the idea of the gaming
tablet that 18 months later turned into
a real product did it not did the edge
pro not turn into a real product and you
might say okay well this is an April
Fool's joke that's totally different
from showing off a concept product at
CES but maybe maybe min-liang tan is a
marketing genius maybe he was fooling us
all along because you know how he's
downplayed this thing right he's been
like all it's good to joke it's not even
a funny joke if you talk to him about it
even one-on-one he's been completely
tight-lipped with me about it but here
today one of a kind I bring you a real
razor chubster
never before seen in person and here in
front of you I'm going to be talking
about the features of macho sir I'll be
making real razor toes do you want to
eat some all right so let's get this
started no I want to make sure that I'm
not misrepresenting the product that I'm
unveiling here today because there were
some parts of their video that were
clearly actual April Fool's that was how
they got us right here we go here we go
but there were real features of the
toaster so obviously they're not going
to be able to put RGB butter on it in
the toaster we don't have that
technology here we go see that lights on
lights on but many of the many of the
ideas integration with Razer synapse to
tell you when your toast is ready the
USB charging port the Razer logo burned
onto your toast
you you guys are not excited enough hit
me again
all right to all that's left now is to
wait in suspense for the breaker to trip
or for the actual toast to pop out of
the toaster oh I don't know if I can
handle this
no no Thunderbolt but it does have
infrared light okay finished model
no no finished model confirmed will have
Razer chroma integration with underglow
come ala tier for RGB I do have
something important to tell you guys
while we wait for the toast to finish
Millington doesn't know that the Razer
toaster is here I'm dead serious
you've probably seen us trolling each
other on Twitter if you've ever been at
a razor line of tech tips meeting you've
seen us
trolling each other in person and this
is my ultimate troll he has no idea that
this is here so what's really important
today is that we keep this quiet okay
so we are not going to blow up min-liang
tan twitter that's at Millington
we are not going to blow up razors
Twitter that is a brazier okay everybody
got that fucking suction well wait a
minute wait a minute this is just this
is just toast this is just normal toast
hold on a minute hold on just let me let
me get some clarification here okay hold
on a minute there seems to have been
some technical difficulties so it's
actually pretty common for engineering
samples to have two versions the mock-up
one that looks pretty sexy and the
working one
this toaster has been hard at work
behind the stage producing loaves
imagine Alberto and I will be sharing it
with you guys right now there we go
who wants he razor toes
remember everybody hashtag don't tell
min okay don't we labor dosqueen min
Lincoln okay guys so I've got something
to let you know this is not the only
opportunity to get Razer toast they are
going to be making toast for the entire
rest of the show over at the razer booth
i think the deal is you got to
participate in the mouse mat competition
till the theme of the mouse mat
competition is troll Linus okay so
apparently that's their revenge so you
design your own Mouse mat the top four
are going to go to the community for
voting and then the top one design is
going to win a custom
