the things that we're connecting the
stuff in my house and some things that
were honestly not doing anything at all
I truly believe that the best solution
for a networking setup is to have it all
mounted on a wall but I rent which is
probably something that a lot of you do
as well
because I rent I can't dictate what I
can screw into my wall very easily at
least very destructively and screwing a
whole bunch of things into one small
area is something my landlord would
probably be pretty pissed about so I
don't really have that as an option but
what I can do is get a big piece of
board mount everything onto this and
then lean this up to the wall so that's
what I'm going to do I'm tired of this
giant pile of networking crap and I'm
going to solve the problem

universal compatibility on its new void
surround headset featuring a genuine
Dolby 7.1 headphone USB adapter click
the link in the description to learn
more we're going to get all these
Ethernet cables out of the way so
basically how all my things need to work
is the internet needs to come in through
the fiber line to my modem then go over
to the router which has terrible Wi-Fi
that always drops all the time so we'll
then go from the router to my access
point and from the router to my switch
because this also obviously doesn't have
enough plugs anyway more than four so
all of this needs to go on to the board
along with a power bar so they can all
be actually powered I also want to label
all the adapters that I know where
they're going and I have some stuff
lying around which I'll get to in a
moment in terms of managing all the
cables once they're on the board so now
we need to work on layout okay so this
is what I have to work with I'm going to
want to cut this down to size of the
circular saw eventually but I'm just
going to lay everything out starting on
one side see how far along I have to go
mark that off and cut it and this will
send whole bunch out okay so this is
more or less what I want to do I need to
take the leg off of this I need to try
to find a shorter power cable for this
and I need to hopefully crimp up some
shorter Ethernet cables okay so first
things first I'm going to go through my
router and carefully remove the warranty
void if removed stickers
Who am I kidding I'm just going to go
right through so the gloss on this
d-link router is just absolutely
disgusting almost as disgusting as its
Wi-Fi capability so I'm going to try to
scratch it and make it not look glossy
anymore now I need to do a whole bunch
of cable routing and try to find some
shorter cables and stuff so with that
we'll be back so I went about trying to
make my own Ethernet cables I made one
of them really well
pretty quickly and then the whole rest
of it was basically one giant
unmitigated disaster so Linus solved
that problem by finding cables of all
the right lengths already made so I'm
just
use those and start on actually
velcroing things down ok so I did some
boring busy work
I've velcro down the router the access
point and the modem the power bar and
these two power adapters they look a
little bit Wibbly but everything is fine
I need to cut the board now and we're
going to circular saw the board and then
use the rest of this board as my
networking board ok so next up I have to
fix this switch to the board this guy's
a little heavy ok so my idea of drilling
through it will not work because I don't
want bolts like way up here on the
outside of it but velcro dog what's up
we used a lot of it it's expensive
thanks Linus oh my god I didn't check
the cabling Wow that's pretty close
ok now I really need to start organizing
cables ok so let's start off with some
slightly larger cable oops
Shh
so the force of the drill actually
pushes it through so I can use those
washers that will solve my problem so
all the ethernet cables are good and
tied down you might notice that there's
nothing going into the switch from the
outside well that kind of makes sense
because I'm not at home right now and
those ones aren't really going to be
able to be managed so that's a little
bit unfortunate but at least I have all
the networking kit itself all managed
and good to go so that if I did need to
ever pick it up and move for whatever
reason I would just unplug the devices
from it take this whole board and then
I'm good to go
which is pretty cool and if I need to
swap anything out it's just velcroed on
this way it doesn't really look like I
cross the cable all right so we're done
this is it it's not absolutely perfect
but I like it I think it's good
I wouldn't played a full ice hockey game
in this clothing during this shot there
you go I didn't even like this is the
shirt I was wearing so that's kind of
weird
ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction first don't speak to a
robot they put you directly through to a
person and you only pay for what you use
the average ting bill is only $24 a
month per device if you're stuck in a
contract they'll help you switch over to
ting by covering 25% of your
cancellation fee up to $75 so head over
to lioness ENCOM and try out their
savings calculator when you sign up on
our link you'll also get $25 in service
credit or $25 towards a new device
anyways thanks for watching if you guys
are inspired and want to make your own
like Ghetto networking wall because you
can't make a cool networking wall
because you don't own your own house
please post it on the lines tech tips
comm forum that would be awesome I would
love to check out how you make yours so
much better than mine so that would
be cool if you liked the video like it
if you just like the video dislike it
don't forget to get subscribe don't
forget to use our Amazon affiliate code
if you buy anything like wood although
that would be a little weird to buy from
Amazon or any other networking gear who
knows whatever that's cool
become a contributor on the forum while
you're posting your ghetto networking
walls buy a cool t-shirt one that's not
completely soaked in sweat for my sake
and yeah check out this video workshop
video love workshop videos going to be
doing more of those all the time because
they're great go watch that see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
