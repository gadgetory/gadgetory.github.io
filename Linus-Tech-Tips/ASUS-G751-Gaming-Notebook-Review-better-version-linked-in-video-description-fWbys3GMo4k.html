from the g7 50 that we reviewed way back
when dinosaurs roamed the earth I mean
okay it was only six months ago but in
the tech world that's like an eternity
because frankly the powerful brick-like
desktop replacement gaming machine
paradigm is fairly mature at this point
but the g7 51 is kind of like the Cat in
the Hat came back same animal some new
tricks watch on to learn more oh and
make sure you're subscribed so you don't
miss any of our other daily tech videos
Corsair gaming RGB keyboards feature
precision Cherry MX RGB key switches for
sixteen point eight million color perky
backlighting for virtually unlimited
customization click now to learn more
first up the core specs get a shot in
the arm with the top tier models
available with the core i7 4860 HQ which
on paper doesn't look that much faster
but seems to turbo better than the older
47:10 HQ and gtx 970m and 980 m graphics
cards to replace the older 870 m and 880
M with the same 5% overclock available
through Seuss's GPU tweak utility thanks
to some non-standard power delivery
componentry for the GPU which leads us
into the physical tour the overall size
shape and weight didn't really get
altered so yeah I still really wouldn't
want to carry it's four point eight
kilogram bulk around with me all day at
school or anything but the finishing
touches got some nice little upgrades an
hour much better imo compared to its
predecessor instead of a plain black
back we get a nice metal shield around
the asou slow go and sweet red accents
on the rear vent covers that hide an
otherwise very similar dual fan cooling
system which is a good thing by the way
because it's quiet under load near
silent at idle and the entire outside of
the notebook stays super cool to boot on
the bottom we find vents a subwoofer and
a doorway to another dimension
no just kidding it's two and a half inch
hard drive Bay on a PCIe MDOT 2 slot
that can be removed if you wanted to add
another tune a half inch drive for raid
or something
not bad storage options but I feel like
a soos could have done better with a
little bit more effort here moving back
up to the aisle on the right side we get
a standard jack for the 230 watt bricked
of a power supply that feeds the 6,000
milliamp hour battery ethernet with a
Seuss's gain first packet prioritization
in bandwidth control HDMI 1.4
thunderbolt this is a great feature for
a creative pro who wants to use this as
a mobile workstation by the way USB 3
and audio then on the Left we get USB 3
a blu-ray drive and an SD card reader
but hold on a second there Linus why
would we want a blu-ray drive on a
gaming laptop do you expect me to watch
my movies on a grody TN panel no I don't
and neither does its use apparently the
17.3 inch matte finish screen is where
the g7 50 series got upgraded in its
biggest most significant way other than
the GPU moving to the g7 51 the g7 51
now features a 1080p IPS panel that
looks just great
very even backlight great viewing angles
just fantastic know overly blurry motion
nothing like that
yeh which leads us to the keyboard which
still has correctly laid out arrow keys
and nice long travel distances on the
keys for a laptop but has actually
changed a lot in other ways some good
stuff and some not so good stuff
first the good the white LED backlight
is now ROG red the spacebar is wider on
the left now for a more relaxed WASD
posture
speaking of WASD the W key now has a
little tactile bump on it so you can
find it without looking and now for the
bad stuff the number lock key has been
replaced by an Asus gaming center
launcher key that opens up a mostly
useless ROG metro view I thing I don't
mind the inclusion of the app because it
does at least let you see some system
info and configure a couple different
gaming profiles with different settings
for LCD appearance
EQ and GPU overclocking and other than
McAfee and wild tangent games and some
CyberLink slideshow maker banging the
system doesn't come with much Blunt wear
but it didn't need a dedicated key and
it definitely didn't need to go where
the number lock key should go and on top
of that a su seems to already know that
we don't need some random game launcher
because they went and included a
dedicated steam button that launches big
picture mode for some reason because
everyone likes big picture mode on their
laptop and doesn't have Steam set to
open automatically when their system
boots up huh we also get a couple macro
keys up here though I prefer them on the
left but your mileage may vary having
them on the top might be perfect for you
and we get a shadow play button whose
position I actually hate worst of all I
fired up GeForce experience quite a few
times reaching for escape and I'm sure
that the last thing any streamer wants
to do is reach for escape to close a
menu and terminate his streams so this
button should really be somewhere really
far away from the gaming zone on the
keyboard but huh yeah I mean other than
that the keyboard is fine and all this
stuff feels really well-intentioned it's
just it's kind of a little bit
half-baked maybe next time they'll get
the layout of that stuff just right
speaking of baking though now we get to
move on to the best thing about the
keyboard there's no baking at all it's
so cool the palm rest is only a couple
degrees above the temperature of the
table next to the laptop the gaming zone
doesn't get much hotter and even the
hottest part of the top of the laptop
stayed in the 40 degree Celsius and
change range during my stare at the
flare in Crysis 3 test holy crap and the
bottom of the laptop was very similar to
I mean I guess there's something to be
said for thick gaming notebooks because
cool and quiet is good for your ears and
good for your hardware performance is a
strong point of the notebook - we did a
dedicated video on this already which
you can watch here but I'll throw the
graphs into this video anyway for your
convenience the 980m handily beats out
the last gen 8 ATM while costing the
same delivering new features having
lower heat output and lower power
consumption and therefore battery
battery life battery battery life
ha better battery life which leads us to
battery Boost 2.0 compared to last gen
simple slider to select a target
framerate and control GPU power
consumption version 2 tries to better
optimize the whole system's use of the
limited current that the battery can
provide usually about half of what the
wall plug can do it also allows separate
in game settings profiles to be
configured for battery and wall power
within GeForce experience so that your
framerate target will be easier to hit
and you can use less of you GPUs
horsepower and it all works
automatically now through GeForce
experience as long as you launch the
game while on battery power it doesn't
support just starting a game on the wall
and then pulling the plug unfortunately
I tried it out in Tomb Raider with a 45
FPS target using the same settings just
for an apples-to-apples comparison at a
framerate that I personally find very
usable and it works I've actually seen
reports of much better battery life
improvements deep into double digits and
less demanding games around the internet
though so your mileage may vary with
this one as well but it's a very very
cool feature I guess that pretty much
winds it up then doesn't it guys thank
you for watching this video like it if
you liked it dislike it if you just
liked it leave a comment if your
