so I'm gonna give you a quick tour of
the stuff that we have on Crazy Stupid
open box promo and why don't we start
with printers so for 49 bucks you can
get an all-in-one laser for 29 bucks you
can get Pixma IP 3600 whenever that is
some kind of inkjet printer
moving right along this is gonna take a
little while there's a lot of stuff here
so we have cases some of these
apparently aren't labeled yet so I guess
they're gonna put prices on them but you
can see we have $19 cases that's a
thermal take case $25 cases we've even
got $10 cases and for many of the
brand-name cases they've been marked
down considerably as well for example
the land boy air is less than half of
the regular price and moving right over
here we have some that are just crazy
like the Lee and Lee PC 888 the sale
ship case you can get this one for only
250 bucks open box pretty neat so let's
keep moving right along here I'll see if
any jump-out fractal design define our
three for 50 bucks
ntek 200 for $29 so that's half price
there's a core center here check this of
course there are 700 d for $99 so you
save 180 bucks on that particular one
crazy madness deal okay why don't we do
notebooks so notebooks there are also
some really good deals here so for
example we have a GT 680 R which is
regular price 1504 $12.99 so it's just
an open box that's the only key
difference GX exists 60 so there's a
core i5 with our Radeon 5870 for only
$800 that's actually a much better deal
than this one that's a really good deal
let's go around here so there's tons of
notebooks we have two racks of notebooks
here Zanna soos g-series so this one's
marked down 350 bucks with a GTX 460 m
in it what else do we have we've got a
couple more G Series notebooks as well
here on the other side some Sony Vaio's
let's see so we've got notebooks
starting at around
well only 250 bucks for what is this oh
this is a desktop PC with a Core 2 Duo
a 20-point 1 inch monitor oh this is
what it has a monitor apparently okay
well that's probably a pretty good price
then whoever priced that probably didn't
realize there was a monitor in there
yeah well good though our loss is your
gain I suppose so we have notebook
starting as low as $200 let's keep
moving along here so here is the table
of random stuff so you'll find things
like media players
desktop PCs from a sir we've got a
Samsung blu-ray player right here 3d
ready Drobo some shuttle bare-bones some
of these are pretty good deals as well
here's an age 55 bare-bones so that is a
don't bother coming in so close I'm just
kind of looking at stuff anyway so
that's motherboard case and power supply
for one hundred and fifty five bucks you
grab an LGA 1156 chip throw that in
there hey course our SP 2500 speakers a
hundred and fifty dollars that's a heck
of a deal as well so let's keep on
moving over here here's another table of
random stuff so we're not gonna go too
deep into this but you know ten dollars
Tony had phones for example might find
something you want their hard drive
deals so boxes of hard drives half price
this one right here so caviar green two
terabyte 39.99 if that's not a good deal
I don't know what is so there's a number
of those we've got a Seagate Barracuda 2
terabyte so that's also 39.99 now let's
see if I can find prices on one pair
buddy so one terabytes are there for
29.99 so if you get here early get those
two terabyte drives cuz that's clearly
the better deal now we have the video
card and motherboard racks so we've got
GTX 570s for a 229 so that is
dramatically marked down it's $100
cheaper than you'll find it anywhere
else we've got a number of those so if
you get her here early you might want to
grab a few for 3-way SLI for a mere Wow
just under 700 bucks for 3-way SLI GTX 5
70s for 60s for 1 1999 we've got rampage
3 extremes for 250 bucks so these are
very very high-end boards we've actually
got a number of these apparently this
one's 269 for some reason but I'm sure
you could negotiate that down to the
same price as the other round page three
extremes if you wanted x58 board the
warehouse sale is where to come
we have saber-tooth for 170 don't bother
coming in too close I'm just playing and
stuff we have P 6x 58 des for 159 and
what else let's see if we've got any
really high-end graphics cards what is
this here's a fifty nine seventy four
two hundred and twenty nine dollars so
if you get here early you might want to
snag that here we go we've bought some
popcorn hours we've got a two hundred
popcorn hours for only 99 bucks that's a
heck of a deal monitors so let's find
some outstanding monitor deals and show
you guys here so here's a $99 acer
24-inch what else do we have that really
stands out here's a 27 inch a sous LED
backlit monitor for two hundred and
twenty nine dollars uh here's a BenQ 27
inch for two hundred and forty nine
dollars there's tons and tons of crazy
monitor deals here's an Easter twenty
three $4.99 let's see if I can find
what's our cheapest monitor here's
something for eighty nine do we have
here's something for 79 for a 23 inch so
that's pretty good there's a 79 up to 20
inch though so if you get here earlier
you want to go for that one let's see
what else we got here Oh more notebooks
apparently okay so you can see we've got
three racks of notebooks here and I
think that's it so 79 bucks gets you an
LCD monitor oh no 69 69 420 1.6 inch so
if you are still using an old CRT no 59
for a 19 inch if you're still using an
old CRT monitor or as little as $59 you
can come replace it with an LCD at the
warehouse sale so come out to the front
here if I have to get the license plates
too much you can avoid it okay so we're
at unit 1 3 5 4 6 2 0 Viking Way that's
in Richmond BC so come check it out we
do these warehouse sales once every few
months or so don't forget to subscribe
