Transformer Pad Infinity TF 700 it's
available in a couple different colors
including a sort of a dark purple whiny
color and then more of like a champagne
yellowy color this is very similar to
the transformer prime that we saw a
number of months ago and bears very
little resemblance at all actually to
the original transformer other than the
fact that it does support the additional
dock accessory which gives you extra
battery life as well as a full keyboard
turns it more into like a netbook II
type thing as opposed to a tablet which
is great because it's got tablet kind of
battery life with like 15 hours of
battery life if you had the additional
dock
so there's your warranty information as
well as your user's manual which is
pretty straight forward you can pretty
much find all the information you need
about using Android on the interwebs so
you shouldn't have to worry too much
about a user's manual included
accessories are pretty sparsely you've
got in these whose wall board as well as
a charging cable so it still uses the
same dot connector as the original
transformer did just like that so that's
where your data and your power are gonna
come from and it includes actually an
exceptional microfiber cloth we have a
couple of these in the tech tips to do
they actually work really well go ahead
and use that alright moving right along
so what is special about the Transformer
Pad Infinity I think I actually charged
this already so it should be working and
should be pretty much ready to go couple
things number one is the display so it's
hold on give me two seconds fast so the
big improvement is the display the
Transformer infinity uses a 1920 by 1200
that is full HD plus a little bit
because it's 16 by 10 display that gives
you almost the same pixel density as the
ipad 3 although not quite it also uses
an unprecedented ly fast Tegra 3
processor the quad core processor in
here runs at 1.6 gigahertz in quad core
modem
seven gigahertz potentially in boost
mode this doesn't necessarily increase
the GPU speed but the extra CPU speed
and the fact that it's using one gig of
ddr3 memory at 1600 megahertz means even
with Ice Cream Sandwich it feels
extremely snappy when you're browsing
and it is very very very fast very
responsive and actually yeah that's
really nice this is my first time
actually using the device so just
outstanding so let's go back to home a
few more things so this is really cool
they've got an IPS plus mode for the
panel so you can either take it right
down to super super dark you can have
sort of a pay attention you can have
sort of a happy medium you can crank it
or up you can crank it even more so IPS
plus mode is for outdoor readability so
if you're sitting next to a window if
you're outside IPS + moon is going to
give you the contrast and the brightness
that you need in order to not have any
difficulty reading text or watching your
movie or doing whatever else that you're
doing now this one's still running
Android ice-cream okay let me get
connected to Wi-Fi here guys speaking of
connecting to Wi-Fi that's one of the
things that the Transformer Pad Infinity
actually improves dramatically over the
Prime so it's been observed anecdotally
that you can get up to several times the
data rate using a transformer infinity
versus a prime at distance from your
wireless access point and the reason for
that is they've made a subtle change to
the design so instead of an all-aluminum
back with their concentric circle
actually quite beautiful looking design
they've added a plastic strip at the top
that plastic strip allows the wireless
the wireless devices inside including
your Wi-Fi new GPS to communicate more
effectively with the outside world so
the issues that plagued the transformer
prime owners are over for Transformer
Pad Infinity owners - ok i'll let's have
a look at the externals actually vulva
reddit so it's got a completely
redesigned camera with a flash as well
as a microphone in it's still 8
megapixels though so nothing's really
changed on that front microSD is still
there it's available in a couple of
configurations 32 and 64 gig
and you've got micro-hdmi as well as
your headphone out jack
down here you see the docking ports for
the keyboard dock as well as the power
and data port on the side you see not a
whole lot and on the top you've got your
volume rocker switch as well as your
power button and that pretty much takes
care of it so feel wise still very light
still very thin so they haven't added a
ton of thickness like Apple did going
from the iPad 2 to the iPad 3 and
there's advantages and disadvantages to
that so they're using a more powerful
Tegra 3 processor they're using a higher
resolution screen that means there's
more to drive for that 25 watt hour
battery that means you're going to see
about a 15 to 20 percent decline in
battery life in certain applications
such as web browsing or watching videos
compared to the existing transformer
prime whether that's a trade-off you're
willing to make is up to you you still
will get you know about nine to nine and
a half hours of battery life out of it
hence they're nine and a half nine and a
half hour battery spec so whether that's
acceptable to you is totally your own
decision personally I would go for the
more vibrant higher resolution screen
it's also extremely high contrast versus
having the extra maybe hour to an hour
and a half of battery life we're using
Corning Gorilla Glass 2 which means that
it's incredibly scratch resistant as
well as impact resistance so you're less
likely to have it shatter or break and
you're right along okay aha sonic Master
Audio so the audio is pretty loud let me
actually find something to playback for
you guys so that we can experience the
audio ourselves how about like
everyone's favorite Canadian superstar
let's go with this one all right yeah
Justin Bieber VEVO let's like crank it
up slicks really excited about those he
loves Justin Bieber
look how great beaver looks and HD @
1080p slick slick Saul like getting all
excited right now
oh oh that's the power button oops I
meant to go for the volume button hold
on hold on hold on I haven't bothered
him enough yet you still have to stay
focused over here there you go
wow this is actually kind of a terrible
song I've never heard it before
oh wow I've got even more terrible okay
fine I'm done with that so the speakers
on the back only one speaker mono
speaker so if you do cover that up while
you're listening to music or watching
terrible music videos then you'll have
to sort of enjoy the muffled sound that
you get out of it I would prefer to see
a stereo speaker set up but it's not the
end of the world
and as long as you got it propped up
against something where you're not
totally muffling it or you hold it up
here you hold it down here you hold it
so like that yeah as long as you're not
holding it wrong bit you'll be fine so
I've got demolition Inc running and no I
don't want to post about my progress on
Facebook are you kidding me no I don't
want OpenFeint
I especially don't want broken faint
campaign here we go
great start
and see how quick the loading is I'm
just kind of curious now I also loaded
the global demo on here so we can see
what kind of performance we got out of
that I'm expecting it to be pretty much
you know what you'd expect from from a
Tegra 3 processor there we go let's just
kind of pan around a little bit
whoa buttery smooth that's really really
nice even when you compared to the the
jellybean tablet the Nexus 7 that so I
took a look at a little bit earlier so
there's that let's load up the globe all
loading seems faster as well I don't
know if that's a function of the faster
memory or the fact that maybe asus is
implemented slightly faster flash for
the storage I'm not sure but both global
and if I could get it to go okay yeah
both global and demolition Inc seem to
load faster on this tablet than they did
on the Nexus 7 so what happens if we hit
mr. clown over here all right okay not
gonna overthink this but huh
there we go so that pretty much does it
it's fast
Oh cancel nope no need for flash player
flash players going away if you if
you're really married to having Flash
Player on your tablet you might want to
stop doing system updates at this point
speaking of which postponed quit bugging
me about this let's see how how the web
browser feels because really that's a
big move that's nice rotation dude we
got a bit of a delay going on there well
hopefully it gets a jellybean upgrade at
some point because jellybean is so
buttery smooth that's the project butter
name so thank you for checking on my
unboxing your first look at the
Transformer Pad Infinity don't forget to
subscribe client seconds from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and if
you were curious as to how much thinner
the Infinity is compared to the original
transformer it's about like so very
significant don't forget it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
