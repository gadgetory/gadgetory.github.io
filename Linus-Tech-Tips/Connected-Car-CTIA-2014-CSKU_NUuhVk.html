brought to you by AT&amp;amp;T alright guys
welcome to the ATT booth where we're
specifically checking out AT&amp;amp;T drive ATT
drive is delivering connectivity to
different cars around the world
including stuff like the Tesla Model S
GM terrain volvo xc60 and audie a three
some of these cars are either powered by
3G or LTE and that's mostly what 18g is
delivering to these devices HTT has
specifically said to me at the show
floor today that they're trying to make
it a car purchasing decision or a car
manufacturer purchasing decision not a
carrier decision when buying a car which
is quite admirable but if you do want
more ATT drive connected apps the car
manufacturers are able to take advantage
of some of those hopefully in the future
to talk about the different apps that
there hopefully going to be able to
partner with I have a conversation with
a GTS senior vice president of emerging
devices division Chris Penrose so what
kind of apps and services are you guys
partnering with to bring to these
vehicles we're really excited on Friday
we made a big announcement of six major
app partners that have come to develop
on AT&amp;amp;T drive platform and really
covering a full range of services that
people are gonna want to use in their
car so first think about in ffort
infotainment and media type of
applications we've got i heart radio
obviously being able to stream internet
radio we've got stitcher be going to
listen that's a certain podcast and then
Newsbeat really exciting one hour or one
minute consumption of different news
articles you wanted to be able to hear
while you're driving so that's great
also some location-based services are
really big in a car and glimpse and
being able to share your location is one
of those great applications out there we
also brought weather in the car and
weather is a believe or not a very
important thing that people want to know
and and finally we also brought parking
because parking is something that we all
do and Parker is a great app that we
brought in the car as well so
accuweather does the weather Parker does
the parking app and we're very excited
to have these first six partners on we
have many many more they're building off
the app for the platform we'll be
announcing in the coming months by
utilizing these apps and general
connectivity you can do quite a few
different things especially when using
them in sync but first off I want to
talk about twinning twinings pretty
interesting if you happen to say leave
home without your phone your car could
essentially kind of turn into your phone
if you have your profile properly set up
and you
home your your car can mimic all the
things that your phone can already do
it'll have its address books that can
call out to people can receive text
messages you knew all those kind of
things and it will do those things as
your phone so if you called someone it's
not going to come from some foreign
number and it's not going to not show up
in their call display as you it will
still appear directly as you all the
time so it should be quite seamless
alright guys thanks for watching our ATT
drive video and our general overview of
the future of the connected car if you
want to see all the rest of our content
from ctia be sure to subscribe to Alanis
tech tips and thank you AT&amp;amp;T for
allowing us to come here this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
