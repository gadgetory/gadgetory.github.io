Lee yacht club thank you to Squarespace
for sending us here to CES 2016 check
out that link a video description down
below so yes it's official much like the
train beyond Lee just made a yacht that
you can put your computer in absolutely
ridiculous the specs of this thing are
pretty solid there's an SFX power supply
there's an included 120 millimeter fan
ITX motherboard mounting you need a
riser cable to go to a graphics card
which actually sits below your
motherboard there's mounting four to
three and a half inch drives or two and
a half inch drives if you want those to
go there one thing to note as well as
this is not the final version this is a
prototype so along the boat for example
or the yacht I guess I should say there
might be portholes with some meshing on
them so it breathes a little bit better
and maybe looks a little bit more Trude
life speaking of true-to-life
that's all there really is to say about
it other than just looking at it
aesthetically it's made it a full fairly
thick aluminum it's honestly quite
impressive but I don't see this working
for everyone obviously much like the
train not every single person who's
gonna want to buy this I would see its
target market maybe being like that guy
with the poofy leather chair and the
really big desk of the office who
actually owns a yacht and wants this
computer to look like his boat or a ship
or yacht or whatever the proper
terminology is for it but if he can't
make it look exactly like it I'm excited
for this for modding the BS mods guys
are literally right behind Brandon right
now who's filming this video and I think
they would just go to town with this so
if you know someone who's got some money
got a yacht or something and they want
to have a nice computer that looks like
their yacht get them to get one of these
cases and bring it to a modder or maybe
you yourself and turn it into their ship
and then post pictures on the forum or
something because that would be
absolutely sick I love the idea of
bringing creativity and computers
together and while looking at this at
first you might be like okay there's
exactly one way to build that that mayor
may or may not be true in terms of where
you put the components but there's a lot
of modding that can be done to the case
itself if you wanna like change the
anchor out or make it so you can pull
the anchor down and pretend you're
anchoring your ship somewhere maybe if
you want to make it actually able to
float I don't know that would be super
sick and in terms of customizability on
the back of the ship on the left hand
side there's three dials for the
brightness
of our gb so red green and blue
individual dials and you can mix them to
make colors in between next up we have
the DK o4 which is their standing desk
adjustable height version of their desk
computers this is pretty cool the desk
computer before had some complaints
because it was rather its depth was
rather high so your knees might go into
it or something like that so this has a
nice combination of being able to adjust
to exactly where your legs are or turn
into a standing desk and they've changed
the form factor a little bit so that
there's kind of space under there for
your knees to go which is really cool
the depth of the computer which has a
vertical graphics card is in the back of
the standing desk so it should be away
from where your legs have to go and I
think it looks absolutely beautiful with
the glass on top and stuff like that
there's two angles you can go with a
computer desk you can have it so it's
viewable from the top like they have
with the glass top and all I can stuff
this to be much harder to do on your own
or you do lines this thing where you
bolted on the bottom it's just it's up
to you so what do you guys think about
the yacht computer let me know in the
comments down below are you part of the
Coast Guard or the Navy that was one of
the best mods guys ideas is you could
get a ship modeled after the one that
you actually command or something like
that pretty freakin cool maybe contact
them about making a really cool system
in one of these guys anyways thanks to
Squarespace for sending us here to CES
2016 this year if you want to have a
website about how do you make a joke on
a yacht you want to have a yacht club
website you can probably actually host
that very effectively on Squarespace you
have a signup form you could sell
memberships using their commerce module
you could do tons of stuff you can
change how it looks every once in a
while if you're just unsure about the
aesthetic you can change the template
rather easily if you're having trouble
with it because you like boats more than
websites they have 24/7 live chat and
email support and if you sign up for a
year you get a domain for free although
if you own a yacht free domain might not
actually entice you that much because
you probably have Cotuit amounts of
money anyways thanks for watching thanks
to Squarespace you want to see all of
our CES 2016 content subscribe to - tech
tips I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
