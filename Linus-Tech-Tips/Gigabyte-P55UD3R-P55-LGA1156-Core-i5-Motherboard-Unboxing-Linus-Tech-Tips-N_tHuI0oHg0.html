gigabyte p55 ud3 R so this is their
second from the bottom as far as launch
p55 hordes go it does still include
ultra durable three and smart six
technologies so let's have a look at the
accessory package that comes with it
here we've got the user's manual uh
which has the i/o shield in it here so
there we go then we've got the driver
and utility DVD then we've got a little
gigabyte sticker then we've got the
smarter six manual the regular users
manual for SATA cables and one IDE cable
so it's a fairly standard accessory
package we've got here survival provider
let's get the board pulled out here
actually looks that's not too shabby for
uh for a lower ish and board now what
you may have noticed about the front of
the box and I'm gonna close it up in
here in just a second is that there is
no support on this board for crossfire
or SLI so even though we've got two
sixteen x PCI Express slots actually we
do have crossfire support I'm sorry
sorry no SLI that's the difference okay
so we're also missing some other
higher-end features like for example all
the SATA 2 ports are not the right angle
ports they're the old older style
sticking out of the board ports like all
pay fifty fifty-five boards we've bought
an LGA 1156 socket here we've got two
four banks of ddr3 dual channel RAM
slots you can see we've actually got a
fairly beefy sort of vrm solution as
well as vrm cooling solution so that's
an eight phase-- power setup and then
let's have a look at the right connector
placement so you've got your eight pin
up at the top left of the board and you
got your 24 pin in the desirable spot
along the very top right of the board so
let's have a look at the i/o panel
you've got a pretty standard i/o panel
here you've got 10 USB ports that's
really nice to see you've got one of
those cool keyboard mouse ps2 combo
ports you've got digital audio and then
a couple eSATA ports 1 Gigabit Ethernet
and a 7.1 audio so you can tell that it
is a bit of a younger brother to the UD
for P but it is quite feature complete
especially if you want to run crossfire
you can actually load quite a high end
system on this board so thank you for
checking out the p55 UD 3r</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
