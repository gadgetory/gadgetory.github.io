would define n FF 12s from Noctua to be
about as proper fans as you can get for
heatsink and radiator applications these
are directed flow fans that are
optimized for static pressure optimized
for silence you can see they have rubber
isolating mount to me honestly just to
build quality these quality of these is
just outstanding
I've unboxed this fan before so you
probably already know what I think about
it if you saw that but if you haven't
seen that friggin awesome basically it's
like the best fan
whereas I going with this ah yes so
without the adapter runs at 1500 rpm
personally I'm going to turn these bad
boys down so I'm going to use the low
noise adapter because I'm a bit of a
silence freak this is going to be my
standardized test bench but before I get
started with my with my heatsink and
radiator test bench I wanted to do a
quick test because I had some people
asking me well you say there's not much
difference between just pull and push
pull as long as you're using good
quality fans what do you mean are you
sure are you sure Linus are you sure so
that's what I'm going to be doing I'm
going to be taking these fans with their
low noise adaptors I'm going to be
running them and just pull on in h100 I
and then I'm going to be running them in
push pull on an H 100 I to see with a
pressure optimized fan just how much of
a difference there is so I will be back
alright guys this video is going to
serve a couple of purposes so number one
it will answer once and for all that
question that people keep sending me
what should I get - cool my CPU and I'm
talking like extreme like not you know
the hyper 212 users out there and you
know that's a good heatsink and all that
but we're talking performance options
here so we have vh 100 i from corsair
right there representing the dual
radiator pre-done liquid cooling class
of products we have the silver arrow
extreme representing extremely high-end
air cooling same dual towers like eight
heat pipes whatever else is going on in
there don't worry I'm not using these
fans and we have the H ATI representing
thick single radiators
should guess I should go find a thin
single red hold on just SEC actually
forget it I said this was for
performance options so we're doing
performance options here now I want to
talk a little bit about my standardized
test bench here this is a Corsair c70
Vengeance case I'm going to be running
it with the stock fans in the front I am
going to be running it with this fan in
the back regardless of whatever else is
going on that is an aqua n ff12 my
favorite fan and whatever cooler I put
in it is getting more Noctua n FF
twelves these are going to be run with
their no glare they're low noise
adaptors because I personally don't
think even for the highest performance
gaming rig these days that there's any
excuse for it to be loud so that's a
3930k in there that's going to be
overclocked and over volted that's a GTX
580 we're going to close up the side
panel because that's enough of CPU
coolers being tested on open test
benches I know it's not realistic so I'm
not going to be lazy about it anymore
guys we're testing all CPU coolers in a
closed case without perfect cable
management just like they're going to be
run in the real world so we're going to
take idle and load temperatures of each
of these setups we are only using Noctua
and ff12 fans we're replacing whatever
comes on whatever coolers we use in the
event that a cooler must use a larger
than 120 millimeter fan we have a 15s so
we can use those instead those are 140
mm fans so let's get started oh right
one more thing the reason I'm using the
same fans on every cooler because the
stock coolers that are the stock fans
that are included with most coolers are
rubbish anyway so you again we're
talking performance options you should
be buying your own fan that's better
also I'm using aftermarket thermal
compound on all of them I'm using IC
diamond thermal compound so there you go
how'd a lot of people talk about IC 7
versus IC 24 guys it's the same stuff
the 7 and 24 for carrots carrots are
just weight they're not purity right so
yeah
consistency so that way we are going to
have a consistent sort of overall noise
level to the system because we're going
to be running good quality fans and
we're going to get a consistent
experience with fans that are
we optimized for whatever kind of cooler
we're using because these are correctly
optimized for any heat sink or radiator
because they're awesome
high-pressure focus flow just good good
good good fans step one
clean the existing thermal goop and any
residue off of both surfaces so clean
CPU is needed clean bottom of the
heatsink is to gain up also needed guys
when applying thermal compound less
really is more remember this is a twenty
eleven chip so that's how much goop it
takes for that for an eleven fifty five
that will be much less for this next
shot prepare for your mind to be blown
I'm going to turn around my shotgun Mike
there we go get that pointed out the
computer so you guys can hear what a
gaming machine sounds like when it's
correctly optimized
Oh Oh it's silent - why do you care so
much about the Silence of your gaming
rig well because it doesn't have to be
loud I'll turn my mic back round it's
unnecessary it's just ridiculous if you
want a loud gaming rig then why invest
in these elegant cooling solutions that
do such a good job why not just use a
stock cooler and why don't you get an
Xbox while you're at it you want a loud
gaming machine I've explained this
before in a previous video but I just
want to go through my methodology again
really quick guys so basically I'm using
real temp GT to take temperatures I am
recording idle temperatures after about
five minutes just idling at the desktop
I am recording ambient temperatures
using my multi lager thermometer right
here with a I forget something T type K
type K type sensor there it is with a K
type sensor right at the intake for the
case so remember guys the front is the
only intake that we're using here so the
air is basically coming from there so
that gives us a pretty good idea of what
temperature the air cooling the CPU
heatsink is and then I am taking low
temperatures after about five minutes
for air coolers I don't need to wait
quite as long but for liquid coolers you
have to wait for the liquid temperature
itself to equalize and then I'm
recording everything here so I no longer
need these noise notes unless a water
cooler has a pump noise because remember
guys with water coolers you have
whatever fans are running on it plus a
pump every mechanical thing you add to a
cooler is a another point of failure and
B another potential noise source and I
want to explain again how I'm correcting
for idle temperature ambient
temperatures so I'm going to correct 220
degrees I had people debating me about
this last time please go find a physics
professor or something and ask them if
this is how it works if the temperature
were to go up to 20 degrees it would
scale by eleven point eight degrees that
that's just that's how it works it's not
it's not something that I want to debate
about so I'll be correcting all
temperatures and reporting them as if
the room was at 20 degrees not as if
it's at nine point two degrees because
I'm in Canada in my garage and another
thing for low temperature testing
we'll be running the GPU at full load as
well as the CPU at full load just to
simulate again a closed case environment
where the system is being taxed and a
worst case scenario for an actual real
system that's actually been built so
let's go ahead and take our low
temperature so I'm taking the second
hottest core which looks like it's at
about 61 degrees again guys this isn't
like the super scientific astray to do
this so 61 and a 10 degree ambient there
we go
it looks like the temperatures haven't
gone up since I did my H 100 I load test
so here's H ATI and I've been saying for
a long time and I was never quite sure
how right I was
that single rad like single
120-millimeter rad solutions dar not
even close to a dual 120-millimeter rad
so you can look at there's our there's
our idle temperature it's around 29 on
the second hottest core which gives us a
difference between an H 109 aah Adi of
like 15 almost 15 degrees under at idle
so let's see how that gets changed under
load all right so here's the H ad with
one fan but I'm going to give the hid
the benefit of two fans since it comes
with two fans so we'll test it that way
as well but it looks like our load
temperature is 85 degrees and our intake
is 10.1 well I was a little surprised at
how much of a difference it made to
switch to a push whoops
10 point oops n point 8 there we go
to switch to push pull on the H Adi I
guess it shouldn't surprise me that much
because it is a thicker radiator I know
on the H 100 it doesn't make that much
of a difference but there you go
our corrected temperatures at idle show
about a 3 degree improvement over just a
single pull fan and then at load it's
about a 10 degree difference however
it's still nowhere near the performance
of the H 100 I or rather sorry hold on
here's our corrected one see about 10
degrees Delta and then our difference
between them and still 13 degrees versus
NH 100 i well it's time to measure The
Contender it should be noted guys that
there is more to CPU cooling solutions
than
just performance I mean for example
these course our coolers do come with
the link software which allows you to
set up things like fan curve profiles
and cool stuff like that
whereas I mean in my experiment I'm
limiting the factors as much as possible
so I'm keeping all the fans at a
constant rpm but that's something you
have to bear in mind also installation
for the water coolers is much easier
than these huge bulky air coolers
however blingtastic they might look with
their multiple fans on them to see the
configuration still standard also with
big air coolers you can see there's very
little clearance between that low
profile dim and the fan itself so you
care you're really limited in terms of
what memory you can install more wires
actually not necessarily more wires
especially with that USB cable that runs
to the H I series so let's find out how
this does Butera alright so idle
temperatures are 26 degrees for our
Silver Arrow extreme and ambience have
gone up a little bit since we started
here to eleven point one degrees well
there you have it guys the H 100 I even
with all other factors being the same is
the ruler of the roof so our ambience
are still eleven point one degrees and
with the whoops sorry with the silver
arrow extreme we are at 67 degrees
whoops sorry about that we are at 67
degrees on the second hottest core so
let's go ahead and fill out those
temperatures and point 167 so you can
see that it perf lips Freudian slip
there so it's 67 degrees under load so
that corrects to about 75 degrees under
load so there you go so there's the H
100 I there's the H Adi with dual fans
there is the silver arrow extreme with
the same fan so you can see the silver a
high-end air cooler so remember guys
something like an NH D 14 will be quite
similar to this in terms of performance
destroy something like a thick a single
radiator even in push-pull with highly
optimized pressure optimized fans
whereas the H 100 I especially under
heavy loads really pulls away from those
other
see it idle these I mean even these two
look very similar but you can see how
under load the silver arrow extreme
really pulls away now that really
demonstrates that as the as the heat
goes up so to speak the the men separate
themselves from the boys and a test like
this I mean even this is only a three
degree difference that's why I don't
like the way that Corsair does the
packaging on these products at least the
way they used to with the h100 where
they would compare it ya see they still
do this it's just goofy they compare it
against an Intel box cooler showing well
okay now they don't even try to show a
proper temperature but they used to and
it didn't show that much of a difference
because it's not until you overclock
that it really makes a big difference so
