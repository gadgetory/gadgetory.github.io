seems like I'm doing a lot of these
lately but there's a good reason for it
the reason is that power supplies are
sort of one of the more interesting
things that you can put in your computer
I mean with the processor they all look
the same
whereas power supplies I mean they all
have kind of a distinctive look to them
they have a distinctive feature set so
today I have the an Tek true power this
is the true power new as opposed to the
true power old because true power has
been around forever as as a brand name
for an Tek so what makes it new first of
all is it is 80 plus bronze so that
means it's slightly better than 80 plus
a regular it's also sli ready and it has
a little green energy-efficient leaf on
it so that's very nice to see it has
advanced hybrid cable management so
that's an techs way of saying that the
power supply is modular okay and it has
a 120 millimeter pwm fan now let's go
into the back double piece double layer
PCB optimizes cooling efficiency allows
for heavy-duty components advanced
hybrid this bed or the other okay why
don't we get this out of the box and we
will have a look at all of the things
that they are telling us about on the
back so unlike the earth watt series of
power supplies from an tech which is
only modular at the very high end on the
750 watt the true power lineup is
modular from the 550 all the way up to
the 750 and the 750 blue now unlike
their true power quattro lineup the true
power new series uses a 120 millimeter
fan whereas the Quattro actually uses an
80 millimeter fan still for design
reasons that I'm not quite sure that I
understand and here we go I got the Box
open so this is what it looks like all
packed inside in antix green packaging
so you can see they're using like
recycled paper as opposed to styrofoam
or something else that's gonna destroy
the earth faster than necessary alright
so inside we will find a power cord okay
just your standard PC power cord we will
find a baggie of modular cables okay so
we'll get to those after I guess we'll
find what looks like an instruction
manual or sometimes it's a product
overview okay so it tells you all about
your power supply what connectors it has
on it it tells you
in Spanish a bunch of languages that I
can't even pronounce and oh in English
excellent English is there thanks for
that all right and then we have the
power supply itself yeah that was Wow
not a whole lot in terms
oh yeah there we go we've got screws for
screws so you can mount your power
supply to your case awesome so we take
off the little paper sleeve that holds
on the little paper clamshell and
there's like there's lots a while back
and it came in a similar package to this
and putting it back was like utterly
hopeless I couldn't believe how
difficult it was to put back and you
most people when they're unboxing a
power supply aren't really too worried
about when they have to box it back up
but oh there's a nightmare anyway the
finish on the true power knew is so just
kind of your standard matte black power
supply finish it comes with a couple
fingerprints on it I'm not sure how much
I like that but the reality of it is
when you buy a product somebody touched
it at some point it was manufactured it
was packaged these things are just a
reality of the computer industry and
pretty much any industry so on the side
here we can find the basic specs it has
a little blue sticker that's really nice
and then it has did it did it three
12-volt rails at 22 22 and 25 amps
maximum power output each and then here
we go we can do a maximum of 54 amps
combined on the three 12-volt rails so
the total output power is 650 watts and
that pretty much covers what we got on
the side we've got all of our
certifications I mean that's something
an tech is very careful about they make
sure that all of their safety stuff is
in line and yeah at the back okay we
don't have the honeycomb mesh that seems
like everyone else uses it's more like a
square mesh okay so that's a little bit
different looking right there and then
on the other side we find a little stamp
tantek logo and that's pretty much all
and then on the bottom we will find that
120 millimeter pwm fan kind of a stylish
looking black sticker on it okay so you
can see downwards into the power supply
if you can see that I'm not really sure
if you can see that at all now let's
have a look at what connectors are
included on the true power news so
50 watts so oh I hate these reusable zip
ties if you've seen me complain about
them before then you'll know that I
complain about them you know that's
something I do want to point out about
this power supply that I don't really
like is thus leaving you see how this is
like a colored sleeve and besides that
you can see like right through it as
soon as you do anything with it it
actually you know what this one's a
better example there that is a black
sleeve and that is very clearly full of
black and yellow cables actually the
BFGS series power supply unboxed
recently even though it was a far more
budget power supply and quite honestly
not as good quality a unit it did have
better sleeping on it okay so the first
one we got antec always has reasonably
long 24-pin power connectors because
they were the ones who pioneered the
whole power supply on the bottom thing
with the p180 so the eight pin and the
24 pin they're always very careful about
that so you got pretty good length 24
pin power connector then you have a
couple of four pin and eight pin power
connectors so once again same thing
these are reasonably long so if you have
your power supply mounted in the bottom
you should be able to reach up to your
to the top of the motherboard just fine
with that eight pin and to the side and
or edge of the motherboard just fine
with that 24 pin and here we have to do
oh I kind of like this I kind of like it
when manufacturers do this this way
because so many people are actually
using two PCI Express connectors on one
graphics card these days you can see an
tech has gone ahead and just thrown the
two PCIe connectors an eight pin and a
six pin on one cable so it's as simple
as plugging them in next to each other
which is so often where you're going to
find it and running away with it like
that in fact if you do have two to two
graphics cards you can put them as much
as this far apart which looks like about
four slots which is the most you're
really going to see and you just have to
run one cable up to your graphics card
Bravo I like that okay the next thing
we've got here is a one set of molex
connectors okay so this one has three
four pin molex connectors just like that
and then it has one additional floppy
connector and you can see the spacing
sort of these are really long
quite long you'll be able to reach
whatever it is you need to reach with
them then we've got three SATA
connectors on one cable all right so two
right angle ones and then one straight
straight one and these again are quite
long and then we get into the modular
cables so the modular cables that are
included will plug into either here we
go it will plug into either these red
modular plugs or they will plug into the
black ones now the black ones are on 12
volt rail one and they are for hold on a
second I made a mistake oh I made a
mistake this is a four rail power supply
I'm sorry they're rated at 22 22 25 and
25 sorry I just I saw this label here
and I love it when they label things
this way because you can see here if
you're plugging into these two you're
plugging into 12 volt rail one if you're
plugging into this one it is 12 volt
rail three and if you plug into this one
is 12 volt rail four so they label that
out for you that's really nice and
either one of these can accept either a
six pin or an eight pin PCI Express or
it could also accept one of the hard
drive plugs okay and these ones though
are for hard drives only okay so if I
can just get this notice right away
about this is that there are more
modular cables than there are modular
connectors on the power supply itself
and what you can tell is that
antec unlike some manufacturers hasn't
missed the point of a modular power
supply the point is that it gives you
options so you can see that with the
with the two included three connectors
SATA cables you could actually plug in
nine hard drives to this power supply
say you don't need any other molex
connectors well there you go you just do
that or say you have a bunch of legacy
molex devices and you need to use those
so here we've got three molex on that
one we've got three molex on that one so
you could plug in a potential of that's
a lot yeah nine molex devices as well as
a floppy device
and then for the final connector we have
here this is a red one and you've got
another six pin or six plus two pin PCI
Express gives you a ton of different
options I'm not sure
based on the package that's included
with the 650 watt power supply why they
bother to include two that are
compatible with PCIe I mean maybe you
can buy additional cables but even then
you probably shouldn't be powering three
GPUs on a 650 watt power supply either
way thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the an Tek TP 650</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
