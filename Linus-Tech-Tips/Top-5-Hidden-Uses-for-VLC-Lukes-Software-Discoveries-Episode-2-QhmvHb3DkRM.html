that goes above and beyond the one
bundled with your operating system you
have quite a few options to choose from
one of the most popular and ubiquitous
ones is VLC runs on everything Windows
OS X Linux iOS even freaking IBM's os/2
yeah the official version of VLC does
actually run on an operating system
whose last release date was December
2001 VLC is known for being able to play
essentially everything you throw at it
but we're not here to talk about how VLC
reacts to a normal media playback
situation we're here to uncover some of
the lesser-known and actually fairly
interesting features of VLC
the cooling master no touch tkl utilizes
genuine taupe or hybrid capacitive
switches and is now available at a more
affordable price click now to learn more
I'll start with a few basics you'll see
does things a lot of other media players
don't like for instance it's one key
audio sync that helps offset with
terribly encoded video audio boosts that
amplifies quiet audio up to 150 percent
without touching equalizer settings and
even features an always top mode so you
can multitask like a boss but I'm having
a good time and I don't have a curfew so
let's take this deeper before we get
started however I want to issue a word
of warning not all of these features are
completely stable in our testing we
experienced a significant number of
crashes and the you I wasn't always
completely user-friendly so I wouldn't
necessarily recommend these features to
completely new users or the faint of
heart but if you put in the time and you
have the know-how and a bit of technical
knowledge you might be able to get a
pretty decent level of stability one
more thing I'll be demoing these on
Windows with VLC version 2.2 point 0
depending on your platform and version
the interface and shortcuts may differ
slightly so without further ado here are
the top 5 hidden features of VLC number
5 did you know that you can stream your
VLC media over the network yep despite
media players in the name VLC is
actually also a media server allowing
you to stream video over a local network
or over the Internet well as long as
your net connection can do that to get
started you'll need to click media and
then stream from there add a file or
files that you want to stream or if you
want to get fancy you can stream from a
disk or even a capture device next like
the new destination or HTTP and press
add advanced users can even stream over
multiple protocols at once after
pressing next VLC will prompt you about
active transcoding why would you want
this well maybe your device on the other
end is slow or you'd like to save on
bandwidth transcoding high bandwidth
content high bitrate content sorry can
be really hard especially when streaming
over the Internet to start the stream
press next where it will give you
little overview of your settings and
then press stream to start one final
note if you're going to do this over the
Internet
you'll need to forward port 8080 to your
host streaming PC also please note the
VLC acts as both the streaming host and
the client so to tune into the stream
simply click on media and then open
network stream and type in the URL of
your streaming PC including the HTTP and
port numbers number four I touch on this
briefly earlier but VLC can transcode or
encode audio and video on your local
system maybe you want to convert that
lossless video into something a bit more
mobile-friendly or maybe you'd like to
convert it to QuickTime so your Mac
buddy you can edit an iMovie whatever
you want to do that's fine
to access transcoding features simply
use the media then convert slash save
menu option and from there you'll add
the file or files you want to convert at
the bottom click convert slash slave
button next you'll be presented with a
bunch of preset profiles good for wolves
cases such as YouTube or Android but if
you want granular control you can change
basically whatever you want or even
bacon some subtitles when you're done
selecting all that poop on a destination
file in VLC we'll go to work on to
number three so you're watching your
favorite show and then something flashes
on screen probably some QR code or
Easter Egg of some sort I mean you can
just play it back at a slower speed with
the default settings of just hitting the
minus hotkey or you can go take it frame
by frame to get the perfect limps of the
hidden secret to do this use the hotkey
e to advance the video frame by frame
then when you've got it just right you
can use shift S to save a PNG screenshot
in your default pictures folder and
upload it to Reddit or the Linus tech
tips forum to show that you're such a
keener oh and if you don't like PNG or
you'd likely you'll see to output the
file somewhere else you can change the
directory file name format or even the
width and height of the output file
right in the preferences
number two whether you're a gamer
programmer video editor or just like
computer user there will be at least one
point in time in your life where it
would be extremely helpful to capture
video from your desktop
maybe you got a weird bug and you need
IT to help you or maybe you just want to
show off your amazing After Effects
tutorial or some
and to media then open capture device
and select desktop in the capture mode
drop down from there select a different
frame rate then hit that down arrow
again and select convert from there it's
just like transcoding except instead of
a file you're translating your desktop
and live select your encoding options
and your destination file and then press
Start to get going once you're done just
hit stop and it'll save the file all
right time for a bit of a tangent before
we get to our number one hidden VLC
feature we have a bonus feature if you
ever wanted to live in the retro matrix
perhaps you have a nostalgic feeling for
BBS's from the 80s well VLC knows your
pain you can actually watch videos via
color - ASCII art to do this and go to
tools preferences video then under
output select color ASCII art video
output and enjoy your video and 16-color
glory okay back on track to number one
this is a neat little trick that's very
deep within VLC's interface you'll see
actually has an integrated HTTP server
that you can enable by setting this up
you can remotely access your viel say
client via web browser to set it up head
back to preferences and click the all
settings radio button under main
interfaces click the web box expand the
main menu and click the Lua add a
password to secure your server click
Save and then close to reopen VLC
setting this interface up makes the
whole system much more powerful remember
how we could stream our media over the
Internet
well it'd be pretty inconvenient to
remote in and start the stream so that
you could watch it elsewhere every
freakin time this feature provides full
access to your VLC client you can play
any item in your library of video
content manage your streams I just
equalizer
even adjust the volume think of it like
a web connected super remote
in conclusion we all say is an extremely
powerful program with an insane amount
of options and while it may be a little
unstable in certain situations and there
are potentially better options for doing
some of these things individually it's
pretty badass to have it all in one
package at the low low price of free
