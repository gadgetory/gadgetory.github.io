the Dell XPS 15 with its great build
quality and strong performance in almost
every category but has the 2017 model
the XPS 95 60 been able to iterate on
that and remain recommended a year later
well let's find out shall we
we're opening up a new merch store you
can check out some of our new gear today
at the link in the video description
physically the XPS 15 has hardly changed
from the previous version not that
that's the worst thing ever the thin
bezel infinity-edge screen is now
bordered by glass instead of plastic
which is a nice touch and overall I
can't complain about the clean look and
solid feel of the XPS even if it's
slightly thicker than some other
professional laptops like Apple's latest
MacBook Pro booting up the Dell XPS 15
the first thing that really struck me
was how darn good the screen is there
are two versions available 1080p and 4k
and both have excellent viewing angles
and brightness our model sports a 4k
screen capable of greater than the full
Adobe RGB color space and it's frankly
amazing to look at my usual complaints
deuced and windows and third-party
applications still scale poorly from
time to time and higher resolution
displays do negatively impact battery
life so if you don't have eagle eyes you
may want to consider a 1080p model but
it sure is nice to have the option text
and icons are crazy sharp making
everything from using word to reading
articles to watching 4k video super easy
on the eyes another nice touch touch is
that its touch enabled I regret opting
for a non touch configuration of the XPS
15 when I reviewed it last year so glad
we've got that fixed this time around
aisle 4 better
our force is basically unchanged you get
two USB 3.0 Taipei's a thunderbolt three
port which comes with all the wonderful
capabilities that it does including the
ability to upgrade the XPS 15 with an
external graphics card in spite of Dells
warnings to the contrary and to adapt it
to run a 4k sixty Hertz display you get
a full sized SD card reader and an HDMI
1.4 port so enough to cover day-to-day
needs and the ability to add a dongle if
it doesn't leading us finally into
something different specs it starts at
$1000 with our config costing a little
bit more with the quad core Core i7
processor that boosts up to 3.8
gigahertz in our experience a fast nvme
SSD and a gtx 1050 graphics card general
performance of the aforementioned
hardware brings us back to things that
haven't changed very much Intel's latest
KB Lake processors are more about power
savings and battery life is pretty good
in our standard test then they are about
faster Excel spreadsheet processing
however gaming is a different story if
you're a casual gamer who wants a sexy
high-performance notebook
I mean 4k ain't happening but when
bumped down to 1080p which still looks
quite sharp despite down scaling the GTX
1050 handles triple-a games pretty darn
well
and even in our synthetic tests
temperatures remained acceptable with
the CPU leveling off around 82 and the
GPU at 77 degrees the fans did get a
little loud but they don't have that
high pitched noise that some other
laptops do and I was able to tune it out
after a while moving on the keyboard
feels actually really solid with no
perceptible flex the keystrokes have a
nice travel and remain quiet but not
mushy sounding and overall the XPS 15 is
great for typing and doing up this
review on it was a pleasure the
exclusive a number pad
be a turn-off for some but I understand
the trade-off here compared to most 15
inch class notebooks the thin bezels cut
down on the overall x-dimension size of
the device a lot giving del only a
couple of inches of space on either side
below we find the trackpad which is
excellent as well it's got a
surprisingly soft feel that makes
navigating Windows feel like you're
gently touching a lover's leg you know
it's like mmm upgrades are easy ish 12
screws and you pop the bottom cover
allowing you to throw another drive into
the two and a half inch Bay at least in
the 57 watt hour model the one we have
has that day taken up by the massive 97
watt hour battery and you can also
change out the memory if you're so
inclined we do have some constructive
criticism though the wireless solution
and windows don't seem to get along
quite right at this time although this
was easily fixed by disabling some power
management settings and a windows
service and given how impressed we've
been by recent Dell audio solutions the
speakers are surprisingly bad I'm still
unsure why they continued with the
webcam placement on the bottom of the
screen what I want a Skype call it looks
like I'm staring off into space and
placing my hand on the home robe
blocks the view of my lovely face I mean
is it really that important that there
Dell logo remains centered this is a
huge problem on an XPS branded device
that straddles the line between
enthusiasts and business where being
able to engage in conference calls is
actually a daily occurrence but with all
those complaints aside I enjoyed my time
with the XPS 15 and I think the
excellent screen aluminum and carbon
fiber construction and great keyboard
easily make up for its lame qualities
with our model coming in at to brand it
isn't exactly a budget laptop
but it does pack a mean punch for the
money as laptops trend towards being
thinner while sacrificing performance
and i/o the XPS stands out for its focus
on pragmatic performance and the
inclusion of a proper GPU bottom line
though the XPS 15 is a great option for
basic use professional tasks like video
or photo editing and even light gaming
