the GeForce GTX 650 this is the power
Edition from MSI which is actually going
to be quite a factor for this particular
GPU I believe although I haven't tested
yet this is my first time opening up the
box so I'm pretty excited about that
this is an OC edition as most power
Edition cards are it uses their trans
thermal design which I will show you
guys once I open it up it's got one gig
of gddr5 although the 650 will be
available with two gigs as well uses a
128-bit bus and the GK 107 GPU so this
is a slightly lower in GPU than the GK
106 that's used in the g4s GTX 660
although the 660ti use of the 104 GP so
just sort of try and wrap your brain
around all that so this has most of the
Kepler features including DirectX 11 as
well as 3d vision support Nvidia
surround their new anti-aliasing
technologies adaptive vsync which turns
your vsync on if you are above your
refresh rate of your monitor and off if
you're below this provides an optimal
balance of performance and avoiding
screen tearing you've got full support
for physics cuda as well as their
purevideo HD technology okay and up to
three plus one displays out so you can
use let's just open it up shall we get
this going guys if you +1 displays up
because I meant to say is great display
so sorry my bad
actually give me a sec yeah free
displays out sorry guys so that's why
what's apart for NVIDIA surround
technology that's sort of dense reason
but not three plus one so if you want
three plus one you're going to want to
look at one of the higher-end cards such
as the 660 or 660ti I mean it's kind of
stands to reason because there's no way
you're going to be playing a game and
surround on sort of a lower end card
like this plus be running an auxilary
display it just doesn't necessarily make
any sense so let's have a look at what
we've got in terms of accessories you've
got a dual molex to PCIe power adapter
you've got
bunch of stuff in here DVI to VGA
adapter ah one of those right-angle mini
HDMI to HDMI adapter z' these are handy
because they keep it from interfering
with your case alright got some
documentation that doesn't really matter
as well as a driver disc but you should
download the latest off the Nvidia
website let's go ahead close this bad
boy up put that in there okay now one
conspicuous absentee from the Nvidia
feature set even though this is a GTX
class card is SLI okay so if you guys
want SLI compatibility you want the
ability to run a couple cards in tandem
in the future you're going to want to go
with at least a GeForce GTX 660 okay at
the time of filming although who knows
or maybe some other GPU coming out later
that goes between them that might
support it that's a lie I don't know
anything about that though so let's have
a look at the card itself right power
Edition what's important about that with
these kind of mainstream mainstream
gaming graphics cards it's all about
getting the best bang for your buck so
you are definitely going to want to get
the most out of whatever overclocking
you're going to do on a card like this
so what a power Edition card does is it
gives you access to MSI's additional
over volting options so those old
revolting options are going to allow you
to really squeeze every last megahertz
until it megahertz out of this card to
get as much performance as you can full
support port for PCI Express 3.0 so
that's a 16x lot and don't worry about
the missing pins it's fine we've seen
this before on NVIDIA lower end gaming
cards and it doesn't actually it doesn't
actually matter unless you need the
extra bandwidth or well not extra
bandwidth it's still running at PCIe 16x
unless you need the extra pins you don't
end up needing the extra pins so the
higher end cards have all them the lower
end ones sometimes don't let's have a
look at the cooler so this is sort of a
unique design check this out okay so
you've got kind of these contact plates
down here which are split up a little
bit okay then you've got thermal
interface material under them that is
interacting with things like like the
memory things like vrm all that good
stuff and then you've got a very open
I'm just going to slide this again I'll
show you what that does later you've got
a very open design
allows a lot of air to pass right
through the card which is going to do a
great job of cooling vrm components as
well as the any memory modules or
whatever else the case may be
speaking of memory modules with the
128-bit bus and with the density of
memory chips these days there are only
four memory chips there on the other
side of the card and I suspect because
this is a custom PCB that they need to
redesign the PCB in order to install
actually hold on those might be contact
let's might be contact pads for
additional ones here actually so they
probably wouldn't need to a two gig card
could be done fairly easily with this
PCB
alright so let's show you guys MSI's
exclusive trans thermal design so you
want more silence you leave it in single
fan mode this is using a propeller blade
fan that looks like in like a 92
millimeter fan so that's pretty cool
see did they have anything to say for
them dial yes okay so we'll use their
diagram so their single fan mode there's
higher static pressure double airflow
mode and then there's actually dual fan
mode suite so this provides more cooling
for the PWM modules in memory this
enhances the heat dissipation capacity
with pressure which remember you need
pressure to push air through fins and
then you need better and this single fan
mode is just like quieter and better
than reference still so the cooler
includes their propeller fins as well as
their dust removal technology so their
dust removal technology spins the fan
backwards to blow some dust out of the
heatsink before then turning around and
spinning the correct way now this will
sound kind of loud when you first turn
it on every time but bear in mind the
card is operating correctly and
everything is okay so I'm going to show
you guys how to transform from one mode
to another one I'm guessing they could
call it a transformer because then Apple
would claim that they invented
transformers and you know tell them they
can't sell their card in North America
anymore are waiting up can pump yeah
must be Apple that's that's the one that
amended everything so here is the double
stack fan configuration and you can see
that they've actually got these kind of
a smart fan design actually I wouldn't
have minded if they were counter
rotating that would be even better but
you can see they've got these blades in
here that will help it generate more
pressure without generating as much
interference between the two fans then
you plug this guy right in
here and all of a sudden you have a
triple slaw card but MSI is giving you
the option to keep it dual slot if you
don't want to install the additional the
initial fan module however you have more
options than that but wait there's more
slide it like this pop it in like this
and oh whoops I did that wrong hold on I
got this I got this ah there we go there
you go dual fan cooler so that increases
the length of the card a little bit as
well
so you still plug the power in there but
you got a little bit more I mean there's
going to be a lot of clearance in most
gaming cases for this kind of a card
anyway but there you go that's showing
you both of the additional fan notes so
in conclusion that is the 6 GTX 650 from
innocence is the power Edition with
their transdermal cooling solution don't
