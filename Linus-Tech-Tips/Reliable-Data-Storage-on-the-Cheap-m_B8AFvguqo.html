I mean maybe your wife or GF or hobby or
kid is a huge photography nerd
maybe you're the world's worst
letsplayer who needs to record hours of
footage to salvage three minutes of
entertaining content or maybe you have a
hundred monkeys tied up in your basement
typing away 24/7 at keyboards hoping to
reproduce the entire works of William
Shakespeare I don't care whatever the
reason is you're looking for a better
way to expand your storage safely and
that is what this video is about
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their core i7 6700 K and Core i5 6600 K
processors check out the link in the
video description to learn more so the
way most people expand their storage is
by buying a hard drive and putting it
into their computer tower wrong if you
need a fast way to expand your Steam
library sure but for bulk storage of
things like photos or videos this is
pretty much guaranteed to be a crummy
way to do it in the longer-term
consolidating your storage in a nas or
network attached storage device makes it
easier to share and if you have multiple
devices like a desktop and a laptop it
helps avoid that nightmare of where did
I put that file or where did I put that
one without relying on cloud storage
services which can get very expensive
with higher capacity plans not to
mention the trust issues that some
people have with giving somebody else
their sensitive data for safekeeping on
top of that even basic networking
equipment these days can handle over a
hundred megabyte per second transfer
speeds meaning that even 4k video
editing across a network is easy as pie
with the right workflow the main problem
with network-attached storage is that
the consumer-grade stuff sucks the
single drive or 2-bay stuff sucks
because it's slow and offers little to
no redundancy that is protection from
Drive failures and the forebay and up
stuff sucks
because the affordable ones are slow
with limited functionality while the
good ones are so expensive you might as
well just buy a computer to do it and
that's ignoring the with some exceptions
generally crappy unintuitive management
software so enough about the problem
then let's talk about the solution we've
been diving into more and more server
grade stuff on the channel lately for a
number of reasons number one I find it
interesting deal with it number two
whether it's higher capacity RAM or SSDs
or many core CPUs it's a reflection of
the
nology that will trickle down into
consumer grade gear in the future which
I find interesting deal with it and
number three which ties in closely with
number two old server stuff can be
incredibly cheap while offering the same
functionality or better than what a
general consumer would be able to buy on
the Shelf today so it's time to hit up
good old eBay
I found that buying a cheap already
built computer is a good way to both
ensure the compatibility of all the
parts you're getting and save a few
bucks versus buying individual
components but your mileage may vary so
any core i3 based machine will be
powerful enough for all but the heaviest
nas use and will sip power relative to a
more feature full processor ensure that
the included motherboard and power
supply are standard ATX and check the
motherboard product page to ensure that
it has Gigabit LAN from there if you
just want a couple of disks and you
don't mind fussing with internal cables
whenever you want to expand you can add
either a free NAS OS like Rock store or
a paid one like the one that we use at
Linus Media Group on raid for like 60
bucks and you're actually sort of good
to go I mean it'll be a bit of an
eyesore but hopefully the money you save
will help heal that wound because a dual
core classed as box off a retail shelf
would cost two times as much or more but
if you want something then that more
closely resembles the pre-built Nazz
experience I've got some tips there too
first you'll want to change out that
case eBay to the rescue again here
search for hot-swap case and you'll come
up with all kinds of options that should
suit your needs this chain bro referred
that I found while writing this looks
perfect for us standard ATX motherboard
compatibility and up to eight drives
LEDs power supplies can be a little
tricky with these rack mount style cases
this one's a to you and not all this
stuff is super standard but with some
double-sided tape or hot glue this one
could be made to fit quite easily and is
affordable if you find something like
this six drive ready bundle you actually
won't even need to worry about
our supply or this next step but most of
the cases you'll encounter will need
power supplies and we'll use SFF 8087
SAS connectors for their hot swap back
planes which leads us finally to the
original inspiration for this video my
search for a cheap storage card for my
personal home server upgrade now I had
thought that I could repurpose an old
raid card but what I discovered is that
for proper monitoring and smart
reporting that is the health of your
drives HBAs or host bus adapters with no
raid functionality just ports to plug in
to work much better than raid cards
because most and there are some
exceptions raid cards even in Jay bond
or HPA mode will not behave completely
transparently which can be an even
bigger problem for OSS that require bare
drive access like FreeNAS the issue is
that affordable HBAs either use normal
SATA connectors making them unsuitable
for use with a backplane or they're made
by brands that I frankly wouldn't put my
important data anywhere near so I ended
up following elpinoine the Linus tech
tips forum to pick up some cheap cables
and a super affordable lsi raid card
model the 92118 I on eBay again that
supports eight drives and can be flashed
to something called IT mode to make it
behave exactly like an HPA after the
flash all the smart monitoring data
showed up perfectly and for five hundred
dollars or much less if you have some
parts lying around to reuse or you don't
mind sacrificing some power efficiency
by using even older hardware from a
thrift shop like free geek we've got
ourselves a wicked box to put in the
closet that depending on the operating
system you choose but we actually
accounted for some budget for under
eight can do so much more than an
off-the-shelf Nazz not to mention the
nearly unlimited upgrade ability down
the line I mean try upgrading this thing
speaking of upgrading once you upgrade
your internet connection today Tom
there is the easy-to-use VPN app for
mobile and desktop tunnel bear allows
you to tunnel through over a dozen
different countries which makes it
appear to website or online services as
though you are browsing from those
countries great for getting access to
stuff that you otherwise wouldn't have
they've got apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac and they also have a Chrome
extension and the greatest thing about
tunnel bear is that it is super easy to
use you just download it install it
basically press a button say okay I want
to be American today
and Boop your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption without any
tomfoolery with you no port forwarding
or any of that nonsense and you are off
to the races and the best thing about it
again actually I've come up with a lot
of best things about it today another
great thing about it is that if you do
have any trouble their friendly support
Bears are happy to help you
another best thing about it is that they
even give you the first 500 megabytes of
data for free so you can try it out no
credit card required then if you want to
upgrade to an unlimited plan which is
quite affordable by the way you can say
10% by going to tunnel bear comm /l tt
so start by is browsing sharp bribe
blast start browsing privately today so
