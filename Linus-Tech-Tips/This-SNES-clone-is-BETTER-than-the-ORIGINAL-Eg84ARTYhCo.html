own that's also technically the number
of super Nintendos that i own that are
also broken but we won't talk about that
for the number of SNES hardware
revisions recommended by purists for
optimal RGB output for the number of
available colors for the Super NT a
hardware reverse engineering of the
original Super Nintendo and for the
number of seconds before I tell you this
video is brought to you by us
check out the LTTE merch store at the
link in the video description we've got
shirts mugs stickers hats
the super NT is the latest retro console
from analog built by enthusiasts for
enthusiasts right off the bat it appears
to be quite a bit less premium than
their original reverse engineered NES
the NT it ditches the USB charging port
for its included wireless controller and
it's made entirely of plastic instead of
6061 aluminium but that's actually ok
because in return we get a selection of
classic and modern designs for both the
console and it's controllers we get a
price tag that's dramatically lower than
anything analog has produced to date a
mere 189 dollars including two built-in
games putting the super ante within the
reach at least of mere mortals unlike
first party SNES classics which have
gone for as high as $400 on eBay
thanks for limiting your production
Nintendo anyway what else do we get here
it still got an SD card slot for
firmware updates with the possibility of
a jailbreak firmware that would enable
you to run games off of it and we have a
single universally compatible SNES
cartridge slot thanks mainly to 1990s
Nintendo and they're curious
implementation of cartridge region
locking move around back there's micro B
USB for power a single HDMI port and
that's actually it no fancy outputs this
time but we do still have real SNES
controller ports compatible with every
single SNES accessory outside of the
super scope and again with the
downgrades where the NT and NT mini had
four here we only get two thankfully
multi taps works just fine though and
that's it aside from power and reset
buttons they really simplified the
outside this time around so have the
internals been cost down too absolutely
not we've got the same altera cyclone 5
and all its companion circuitry on the
top side of its beautiful PCB programmed
again by Kevin Horton aka keV trous the
same legend who did the reverse
engineering for the analogue NT minis
FPGA though he didn't go it alone this
whole thing has actually been something
of a community effort with input from
people like Beauty
author of the super-accurate higen
emulator intro sound effects by
electronic musician square pusher and a
shiny new user interface designed by
indie developer phil fish yes that phil
fish complete with a super slick
optional animated intro that randomizes
each and every time you power on the
console within the menu you'll find a
ton of options to customize the
experience from adding and controlling
the depth of scan lines to enabling more
sprites on-screen than the real SNES
could handle to adjusting hotkeys audio
volume and even the skin of the user
interface it allows you to add filters
like the previous consoles or remove
filtering entirely if you just want
those beautiful chunky pixels in all
their unaltered glory as for what it's
like to actually game on to answer that
question I brought in my framemeister to
test out an OG Nintendo adapted to HDMI
alongside our super NT with an SD to
SNES so we could test as many games as
possible let's start with compatibility
testing analog claims its 100% because
they're actually simulating the chips in
a real Super Nintendo and from what
we've been able to tell they've hit the
market dead on believe it or not not
only does the Super NT handle edge cases
that were only recently discovered and
patched in emulators the way they've
done it allows them to improve upon the
original without sacrificing that
compatibility in particular with the
sound so after spending some time with
it to say that it's a great experience
would be a huge understatement
it handled literally everything we could
throw at it including enhanced msu 1
games with CD audio tracks and FMV the
picture is sharper the audio is clearer
the input lag is non-existent every box
is so thoroughly checked for this little
thing that people around the office are
already competing for their pick of the
sample units with others saying they're
just gonna buy one themselves if they
miss out which is probably the boat I
will be in if you spent any significant
amount of your childhood playing Super
Nintendo games you want the real
experience on modern
where this is it
I mentioned this already but the sound
is one of the best things about the
super MT although I would personally
like a toggle to put it back to 100%
original they won't tell us how they
improved things exactly but knowing a
little about the super Nintendos audio
processor helped us kind of piece it
together the SNES mixed together
individual sounds like a drum or a
guitar to make music or sound effects
and these small sounds were usually
somewhere between eight and twenty two
killers the og Super Nintendo just mixed
them together at 32 kilohertz with a
Gaussian Gaussian bhooshan Gaussian
filter that basically muffled it to hide
the resulting noise meanwhile the super
NT mixes them at forty four point one
kilohertz along with modern cubic or
sync filtering so everything sounds much
sharper and truer to the artists intent
pretty cool stuff there are some
dilemmas with the console like this if
you're a new collector and want to
support the original developers of the
games you're playing the only real way
to do this is ironically via Virtual
Console and the classic series which are
our emulators that don't give you the
original experience and the only way to
get the classic series anyway is on eBay
making your purchase less meaningful to
developers and more meaningful to
opportunistic scalpers and what if you
already have some games is it worse to
buy unofficial hardware or is it worse
to pay scalpers who buy up all the
official stuff is it just as bad to
download all your games and throw them
on to a SD to SNES or a Raspberry Pi for
that matter well nope I can't answer
that I'm gonna bail hard so anyways then
if what you're after is a no-frills
easy-to-use experience with full
compatibility with all your favorite
SNES games and as close to real hardware
as possible all while having full
compatibility with modern displays
there's really no contest this is your
go to it's super inexpensive compared to
getting a framemeister and
potentially modding your SNES it's
well-built its feature-rich
