laptop wrapped in leather I knew we had
to get one if for no reason other than
to poke fun of people with more money
than brains but once I found out about
it
heaps of battery life gigabit LTE
connectivity and super interesting hinge
design I started to come around to the
notion that the spectre folio might be
more than just a pretty face
we could be looking at right now a
serious contender against the MacBook
Air and the surface laptop honey is a

tea
there are two things you're going to
after you figure out the stupid pending
there are two things you're going to
immediately notice about the specter
fully off first that it's covered in
leather and second that leather smells
really good it's actually kind of
amazing how much a scent can change our
perceptions like pulling this machine
out of your bag there's like this this
feeling of for me anyway of like
readiness like the the closest analogs
that I have are pulling on my riding
gloves and stretching them out a little
bit or cinching up a horse saddle ready
to mount like it's just it's kind of
crazy and it also feels great to hold
with it's nicely rounded spine it just
feels professional but once opened up my
feelings about the specter folio do get
a touch more complicated so the way that
the leather wraps around the screen
creates this kind of weird-looking
double bezel I I really wish they could
have had the leather end right at the
edge of the display and overall I think
given another generation they can
probably improve the way that the metal
components transition to the leather
ones and then there's this pen holder
frankly speaking it's stupid like could
they not figure out any better way to
secure this to the side of the display
honestly I would rather they had just
done nothing I'd rather they say wear a
shirt with a pocket in the front and put
it there because other than that the
overall feel of the machine is very
solid there's virtually no flex to this
thing and I trust HP when they say that
the leather is not gonna wear quickly
like this is really nice it's the same
kind of stuff you might find in say a
Mercedes now IO is pretty bare-bones ish
but overall the three USB C ports two of
which are Thunderbolt 3 all of which can
be used for charging give you a lot of
flexibility to connect other devices to
the folio provided you're willing to
dangler two and a headphone jack is
thankfully present now the display comes
in both 1080p and 4k varieties are rocks
at 1080p one and given the screen size I
really don't see any need to go higher
than that and thankfully HP has provided
the option to have touchscreen on either
resolution good work you guys a problem
with the display though is that it feels
like there is a lot of wasted vertical
real estate here like going from a
surface laptop or a 20-18 macbook air to
the folio is gonna be jarring and it's
made that much worse by this massive
chin bar hanging out here that would in
a perfect world just be more display for
a 16 by 10 aspect ratio it is nice to
see a fairly good webcam implementation
though and the inclusion of Windows
hello facial recognition is a huge plus
overall the display still gets an A for
its excellent brightness colors and
touch support which goes well of course
with the convertible nature of the
spektr folio this is quite possibly its
strongest point like this is a really
smart 2 in 1 laptop design it's got
these nice strong magnets so you can
still operate it like a normal laptop
but put a little bit of pressure like
this and boom moving from one mode to
the other is very simple and the ever so
slight incline when it's in tablet mode
allows the included pen to be used very
comfortably again though I really hate
the way it secures to the device but the
writing experience is solid comparable
to that of the surface pro even if it
doesn't quite keep up with the near
instantaneous responsiveness of the iPad
pro now you do carry around more bulk
than the surface pro but I mean I think
that's a trade-off a lot of people would
be willing to make for the ability to
use the folio on their lap without it
kind of falling off and it's really nice
that unlike some chewing ones the
keyboard is not going to end up getting
scratched up in tablet mode so it just
looks kind of ratty and gross after a
short while the speakers are pretty good
with X
clarity making them great for hearing
dialogue like in video calls obviously
very business oriented products but as
you might expect they do lack bass and
their grill takes up a lot of space at
the top of the notebook that I just I
really wish could have been used to move
up the keyboard and make space for a
bigger trackpad look at this poor thing
actually we should talk about the
keyboard first here's what I can say
about that that's positive
if you finger peck or you type pretty
heavily you might actually really like
it
the travel and the tactile feedback are
both solid but for both me and Alex and
we do often disagree about these things
the stiffness of the key switches and
some noticeable inconsistency in their
key stabilization made it really
difficult to get into a groove and
maintain our top typing speeds that's a
shame now the experience will be better
if you have smaller hands since your
palms will sit on this delightful
leather palm rest instead of on the edge
of the device but when you compare it to
the comfort of the surface laptop and
the MacBook Air it just doesn't quite
hold up and then coming back to the
trackpad well it's also kind of matte
there's slightly more force required to
click it than I'd like and this
completely rules out Alex's thumb
padding technique ways typing and it's
out of the box acceleration curve is
weird at best it kind of seems like
they're compensating for something
you know what I'm talking about no like
literally it seems like they're
compensating for the small size of the
touchpad to make sure you can actually
get all the way across the screen
overall it gets I don't know c-plus so
that was the pretty bad stuff but there
are more good things LTE support means
that you can be productive from
basically anywhere like it baffles me
that features that we take for granted
on a couple hundred dollars Mart phones
like SIM slots and decent cameras have
taken so long to take off in ultrabooks
maybe this is changing though so a
device like this along with cheaper data
will make it so that you don't have to
worry about things like airport hotel or
coffee shop Wi-Fi
and all the security concerns that go
along with them and this feature is
perfectly complemented by the spectre
folios incredible battery life
the shocking fifty four point three watt
hour battery in this thing complemented
by a low-power processor and one watt
display means that you can expect LG
grande levels of freedom with the folio
even if it is a touch heavier and the
low-power processor brings other
benefits the Spector folio is completely
passively cooled and comes with a built
in coffee break feature that is to say
that in short tasks the dual core Core
i7 is pretty snappy but if you ask this
thing to do anything even remotely
resembling heavy lifting like even just
installing a program you might find that
you've got a minute
to run over to the break room and see if
anyone brought in snacks today okay yeah
I was being facetious there that's not
really a feature um
and honestly this was kind of a
confusing thing about this device to me
because on HP's reviewers guide the
number one pain point that HP identified
for Millennials was performance but then
that's where they ended up making the
specter folios biggest sacrifice well I
mean other than the cow that they
slaughtered in order to manufacture it
the dual-core processor makes it
noticeably slower while performing tasks
like basic video editing working on
small CAD files and doing more serious
photo work and this wouldn't be a
problem except that basically every
other Ultrabook on the market with the
notable exception of the MacBook Air has
twice the core count at least as an
available option and with the specter
folio coming in at about the same price
as the surface laptop that makes it
tough to recommend it gets some things
really right
like the hinge design the battery life
and mobile Internet and it really does
feel good but it gets enough things
wrong but I find myself intrigued to see
where they'll go with the next one
rather than ready to pull the trigger
today it does feel good though
I think it feels good if you're a small
business owner it does not feel good to
go home at the end of the day and be
fighting with your accounting software
rather than spending time doing what you
love or with your family or whatever the
case may be in fresh books is all about
taking that accounting work that you
might end up having to do at the end of
the day when you just want to relax and
making it simple with fresh books you
can create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds you can
set up online payments with just a
couple of clicks and get paid up to four
days faster you can see when a client
has opened your invoice for the first
time to put an end to the guessing games
and you can take the whole experience
