follow-up on the GTX 580 twin froze or
two overclocked
video card unboxing that I did so I've
got the card here and I promised you
guys that I would compare it against a
reference cooled card so here I've got
an EVGA GeForce GTX 580 reference card
so it's using the stock Nvidia cooler
I've got my trusty temperature probe
which tells us that well okay as of
before I walked over there it was at 22
degrees but I guess now we're up around
23 ish degrees and I've also got fir
mark running now remember fir mark does
no longer deliver accurate results if
you're trying to find the absolute max
temps of a geforce card however since
we're comparing two identical cards to
GTX 580 s we can trust it to tell us the
relative temperatures under a similar
load of these two cards so you can see
up here in the top right corner
our GPU temperature is that and you
can't see that at all can you I guess
I'll just have to walk over to the TV
and not be lazy all right so our GTX 580
is running at 69 degrees with a fan
speed of about 2,000 rpm that stocks
means here and I'm just going to take a
quick audio sample for you guys to show
you what the reference cooler sounds
like under load
and here is the twin frozer - you can
see our room has warmed up a little bit
so whenever you're comparing the Twin
Frozr to results against the stock
cooler results you should assume that if
the room temperatures were the same that
the temperatures of the Twin Frozr -
would actually be a couple degrees
cooler looks like it's fluctuating as I
move around it's a very sensitive sensor
there so anyway the Twin Frozr - Peaks
bearing in mind this is an overclocked
card so it runs at 800 megahertz versus
the stock frequency of the GTX 580 and
oh please focus come on come on what can
I collect you can focus there you go
okay so 800 megahertz and then we've
also got a peak GPU temperature of 57
degrees so that is pretty darn
impressive the fan rpm is around 2400
and that is what it sounds like so the
Twin Frozr - absolutely destroys the
stock cooler in terms of performance
personally I think it looks nicer - but
you know to each his own so thank you
for checking out this little video on
the msi gtx 570 Twin Frozr - don't
