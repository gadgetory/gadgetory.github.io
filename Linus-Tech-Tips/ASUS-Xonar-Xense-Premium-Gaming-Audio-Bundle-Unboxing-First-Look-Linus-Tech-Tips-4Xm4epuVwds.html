is actually a bundle product this is the
azuz sous-sous zonar vent so this is a
premium gaming audio set which means it
comes with a premium gaming audio sound
card as well as a premium gaming audio
headset and this is the I mean this is
exciting because this is actually a
Sennheiser PC 350 that is rebranded
especially for this bundle so the value
of this bundle is phenomenal because
this is a really expensive headset this
is an expensive sound card and actually
come together for a price that's it's
still expensive but you know it's not
it's less expensive I guess so here we
go go with yours ends go for glory let's
talk a little bit about what a soos has
to say about themselves on this product
triumph over your opponents and FPS
games with precision acoustics and race
clarity for the win with EMI shields and
118 decibel sound to noise ratio and
fight to the end with ergonomic that's
that design this is all very good stuff
and let's have a look at what they have
to say on the inside of the box so first
of all this is tested for the ultimate
gaming gear alright so basically they're
saying it's you some Sun highs you're
teamed up which is planning on what I
was saying before which is very good
okay you can triumph over your enemies
now this is key right here
powerful headphone amplifier this sound
card the Zen sound card here actually
has a headphone amp and why is that
important you might ask well because the
PC 350 is actually a very premium
headset and what that means is that the
drivers in here have a higher impedance
than just your typical cheapo headphones
so it means that in order to really get
the best results out of this particular
headset you need an amplifier so until
recently you couldn't buy a sound card
that had a proper built-in headphone
amplifier but now you can so there you
go embrace clarity for the win so in my
fielding covers it so that you don't
have sort of random interference so I'm
bothering your sound card realistic 3d
gaming audio okay here's your i/o ports
list right here so we've got a mic line
in headphone output with support for up
to 600 ohms of impedance nice
7.1 channel speaker output as well as
digital audio output so we've got the
whole works here's your package contents
which we're not gonna look too closely
up because we're gonna open the package
and we've got Christoph Christopher
Sunda okay true pro gear for pro FPS
gamers they've got a little gamer quote
on there - excellent so I'm gonna go
ahead and try and figure out the best
way to open this box which appears to be
from this side not the other side the
other side is tempting they got those
stickers on there but I'm on to their
tricks I'm gonna open it from this way
okay oh okay
no I get it you have to do both so I'm
not onto their tricks their tricks are
too tricky for me see this is the
problem with like live one-take unboxing
videos is i have to like figure out the
box in real time you know I actually had
a pair of PC 350 headset not a pair of
Henson I had a PC 350 headset not long
ago and I also have an HD 5 5 v and I
gotta say the HD 555 particularly is one
of the most difficult boxes I have ever
encountered in fact it seems like a
headsets in general are fairly
challenging like I had some real
problems with the courser hs1 as you
guys may or may not recall if you saw
that video I just couldn't get that box
apart the life of me okay so let's have
a look at the sound card version okay
okay here right away like plus 10 points
check it out
matte black PCB as soos gets major major
points for that because nothing looks
better in a gaming machine then a matte
black PCB with nice shiny chromed
accents and that is just outstanding
okay so there is that that shield that
they were talking about so you can
actually hear you can see under it in
some places you can even see a copper
heat sink down there so they are
actually cooling probably the amplifier
would be my guess cuz I can't imagine
the audio processor needs a copper
heatsink on it but you can see right
here that this part does require
external power from a 4-pin molex
connector
okay we've also got a plugin for our
front panel audio all right let's see
what else we got on this card that's
worth talking about hmm I mean I wish I
could sort of show you more of the car
but I can't because it's got this cool
shroud on it but I mean the shroud is
pretty sweet but when it's installed in
your case you'll probably see it sort of
something like this so you'll be able to
see the bottom of it a little bit you'll
be able to see the top acoustic powered
by Sennheiser it's really really nice
looking card okay so here you oh yeah
this is important PCI Express 1x that is
the interface that this card uses and I
get a lot of questions about this but
yes you can put a PCI Express 1x card in
a 4x slot in an 8 X slot and the 16 X
slot doesn't matter
it'll just use less bandwidth boom done
so there you have it that is what you
need to do you just plug it into any PCI
Express slot and it'll work 100% okay
here we've got spit of output so that's
your digital out here we've got seven
point one out and I'm probably gonna
find an adapter somewhere to show you
how to use that then we have our
headphone as well as our microphone now
please note these are the larger audio
jacks not the ones that you typically
find on the back of a sound card so here
we go you can sort of keep picking away
at this box and figuring out how exactly
it comes apart okay there seems to be
some kind of tabs here we can see how
that works okay that comes off there but
then it oh yeah here we go so there's
Clips here and plastic I mean the thing
is you'd never be able to put this box
back together you took it apart I mean
maybe that's the point cuz most places
NCIX included don't take returns on
headphones for hygienic reasons and so I
guess they want it to be as difficult as
possible to put it back together without
looking like it's been taken apart so
here we go we've finally removed that
part of the plastic oh I think we can
actually
no we can't slide the whole thing out we
can slide out part of it you gotta get
kids me okay so that's not secured in
there in some other fashion but I think
we found the accessories yes we have
achieved something today there we go all
right so here first things first let's
find this is this oh look at that
you gotta be kidding me
it looks like this can do not only
coaxial out but also optical audio out I
did not notice that on the box that's
very cool so you got this little adapter
so it'll grab your optical signal which
is actually under the coaxial a digital
audio that's really cool okay so there
there's that we've also got a where's
that but one adapter also if you want to
use it with with something else because
you can see the included sense headset
already has the larger Jack's but if you
wanted to use it with a smaller headset
they've included one adapter for that as
well okay and then here is the adapter
for the what appears to be a DVI port
but do not plug a monitor into it I'll
tell you that much right now not plug a
monitor into this so you go ahead and
plug that in there then you can go ahead
and and there is your 7.1 audio out and
they are color-coded and those do appear
to be gold-plated connectors we are so
that's pretty much it for the sound card
I think we got everything relevant
plugged into the right now so you can
see it in all of its glory
here we have a Zilla or Quick Start
Guide which also has the driver CD throw
it away download the latest off the
assist website Quick Start Guide shows
us a little bit about the audio card
layout okay so yeah here there's a combo
digital output port very very cool very
clean gaming headset UCI bus golden
fingers install the audio card do all
these things what else we got here is
connect the TV tuner card hmm okay
that's it that's it for English alright
now I'm gonna have to ask the cameraman
probably to uh oh never mind okay I
think we got it
one step fun there we go I think now we
can extract the headset yes success okay
so this is a fairly standard looking PC
350 other than the than the larger
headphone and microphone connectors
let's go ahead and extract it from the
plastic PC 350 as I mentioned before
this is an expensive and premium gaming
headset so you've got a nice plethora
material it's designed to fit extremely
large ears so if you've got like long
ears you can actually wear the PC 350
quite comfortably and I do know a couple
of people with PC 350s who have also
said that it is extremely comfortable
even with glasses because of the way
that the cushioning is designed you can
easily have something sitting under it
and it's not going to put undue pressure
on your head now you don't have the
padding only on the ear cups you've also
got it on the headband itself where it
is actually even softer I mean it's hard
to demonstrate something like how soft
the cushioning is on something but I
hope this kind of gives you the point
like I'm putting no pressure on this
whatsoever
it's very comfortable for long gaming
sessions it includes a boom mic which is
adjustable so in terms of how far you
want it to sit away from your face so
you see you can put it up here and then
you can bring it down and you can
actually adjust it in so if I just kind
of give it a bit of a bend then it'll
come in like this and if you want it a
little bit further away then you can
adjust it a little bit further away like
that now these are a closed headphone
which means that I actually cannot hear
a whole lot of what I'm saying right now
but the benefit of that is you have a
very good stereo effect because you're
not going to get any spillover when the
right speaker makes noise say someone's
walking over there and you hear the
footsteps right so when the right
speaker makes the noise it's not gonna
leak out and then come in to your left
ear so it's able to keep things very
isolated for good directionality and it
also means that you're not going to
disturb others when you're gaming late
at night
there's like no explosion gunfire on a
lot of stuff the people in the next room
are not gonna be like banging on your
wall hey what do you think you're doing
so that's that's a definite benefit of
using a closed style headphone and I
think we've shown these in pretty good
detail you've got the labels here for
the right as well as for the left
earphone although there's a quick check
if you put it on and the mic doesn't
come down towards your face if it comes
down in the back of your head then it's
probably not on the right way I think so
that should that should pretty much take
care of itself for most users all right
and last but not least we have built-in
volume control which has a nice little
volume indicator there as well as an
on/off switch for the mic thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the Zoners
