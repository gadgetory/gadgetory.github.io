you by AMD learn more about their new
rise in CPUs at the link in the video
description hey we're back in the
silverstone suite at CES for another
episode of the top five products that
nobody asked silverstone to make the
first one is the FG 120 and 140
depending on if you want 120 mil or 140
ml sizes this is an RGB fan grill yeah
baby it uses the standard 4 pin RGB
connector so you can actually put it in
line with the rest of the strips and
controllers that you have and this gives
you a couple of cool options so
silverstone can ship RGB enabled cases
that let people swap out the fans to
different ones without losing the RGB or
remove the RGB lighting altogether and
keep the fans that are included and it
enables anyone to add RGB lighting to
any fan that they like number two the
you co2 this is a 10 port USB 3.1 gen2
bit hub that supports 2.4 amp charging
on all 10 ports simultaneously so inside
this USB charger is a 200 watt power
supply obviously not for the faint of
heart
they're thinkin like maybe teachers who
constantly have students asking to
charge their phones now they can meet
those needs and I'm thinkin video
professionals an astonishing amount of
video gear charges off USB and if we
just had a couple nice high-quality USB
charging hubs we'd be able to charge
everything at the same time with that
said this is not going to be cheap but
sometimes that's the price you pay with
professional gear honorable mention here
by the way is they're stacking wireless
charging battery banks so you can throw
up to three of those and charge them up
and then you can take them around with
you can charge either wired or
wirelessly item number three we got to
go past the upgraded version of the
remote PC starter kit
this is the ECP 0-1 now no one asked for
this one but this one looks pretty
freaking cool you can use either molex
or SATA to power it and then you get a
USB port that's just power on the back
here computer and this if you have an
external drive and you don't want to use
an extra brick plugged into a wall
outlet or a strip the it comes with a
cable you go 12 volt - 12 volt boom now
your external drive can be powered
straight off the back of the computer
number 4 an 800 watt 80-plus titanium
SFX L power supplies so for scale that's
a 120 millimeter fan what could you
possibly do with something like this how
do you get 800 watts worth of power
consuming components in a small
form-factor case that's a great question
Silverstone's justification for this is
that maybe we could see a new class of
like micro ATX cases where you could run
like SLI Titan X Peas and have the
horses to power them I say that sounds
insane and number five is the MM s 0 -
this is a USB 3.1 gen2 so 10 gigabit per
second external enclosure so we put a 2
and a half inch hard drive in here and
it is ip68 waterproof fish ish remember
nothing is waterproof so if you were
thinking gee I need myself you know all
aluminum like feels really nice
integrated cable external drive
enclosure that I can just plug into my
computer and Pam drop in the water you
got like ultimate drive cooling I
seriously don't actually recommend that
then this would be the answer to your
prayers oh and it's type C boom look at
that so thanks for watching guys this
was our top 5 things nobody asked
Silverstone to make but let me know in
the comments do you guys see uses for
any of this stuff which one's your
favorite and what would you use it for
