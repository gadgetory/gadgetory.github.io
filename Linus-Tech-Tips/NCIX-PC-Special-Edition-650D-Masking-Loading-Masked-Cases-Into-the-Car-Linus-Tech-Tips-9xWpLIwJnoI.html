one of the systems spear doing the pop
there because we don't want any
overspray to end up in the inside of the
case so here's a couple that are masked
already so you can see the only parts of
the actual case that are going to be
painted red are just this strip along
the back just because there wasn't
really a natural natural divide other
than right here where there's a bit of a
lip to the case the top of the case will
be done as well as the sides just this
little strip along the sides up till
this point so that when we put the side
panels on you won't see the dividing
line between painted red and not painted
red so then the side panels will be done
and the front grills will also be done
so we've got two cases prepped working
on the third and then we've got two more
to do after that for this limited
edition run of five systems okay so
we've got the car loaded up crazy
Russians just taking the last one and
putting it into my car so you see we've
got four Corsair obsidian 650 DS loaded
into my little Civic here and we've got
some all the accessories side panels and
whatnot in the trunk so we're going to
take them to the painters now very
exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
