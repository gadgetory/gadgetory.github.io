world of Pokemon go being somewhere
important or notable is very helpful in
terms of population of Pokemon and
various other item acquires and all that
kind of stuff so being somewhere like
London or Central Park in New York or
something like that would be awesome
what if you could be there but be
playing from your couch this is
especially helpful if you have some form
of physical disability or if you live
somewhere rural where there just aren't
Pokemon stops anywhere near you and
maybe only a couple spawns for Pokemon
at all that can be frustrating but
there's downsides to this as well fairly
obviously I'll talk about that later
intel skull canyon nook features the 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more in the length
of your description down below how one
would accomplish this is through
something called GPS spoofing
essentially tricking your phone and the
apps on your phone into thinking that
you are somewhere that you are not this
enables you to do the after mentioned
sitting on a couch while your phone
thinks that you're in Central Park
general idea you do this by simply just
downloading an app that does it all for
you telling the app where you want your
phone to think you are and then you're
done if you're doing that for things
that aren't just Pokemon go when you try
to do it for Pokemon go things get a
little bit more tricky this isn't this
company's first attempt at something
like this they made a game previously
called ingress and they're used to
people trying to screw around in these
ways that being said there are
workarounds first off you're going to
need a rooted Android device or a rooted
emulator if you want to use an emulator
on your computer I would recommend using
BlueStacks the application to emulate
Android then you're going to need a few
different apk files you'll need lucky
patcher fake GPS and Pokemon go first
you would install a lucky patcher
through your previously rooted device
then you would use lucky patcher to
install fake gps as a system application
tell fake gps where you want it to say
you are and other various details like
how fast you want to update and other
things that you can program yourself
very easily through the settings option
then go into your location settings and
Android and turn off Google location
history and change your GPS accuracy to
low although this may take some fiddling
later on you may need to make it too
high or even medium if you must because
the game refuses to update its location
if you're in Windows 10 you need to make
sure all of your location services are
off just type location in the Start menu
and then make sure both of the location
options are individually turned to off
if that feels too difficult that would
be fair it's more of an advanced user
thing if you want something more simple
you could go with Pokemon go anywhere
which enables you to click on the screen
for movement instead of actually just
walking around enabling you to leave
your house and walk to the park by
clicking on the screen
instead of getting up from your couch
now there are problems with this most
importantly in my opinion is that it
completely breaks the gamified features
of the game the whole idea of the game
is that you're supposed to walk around
and try to find all these Pokemon and
there's like location meters the little
feet and you're trying to track things
down and it's fun to search and locate
on your feet it brings you outdoors
that's the purpose of the game but even
beyond that if you're like I don't carry
Luke I don't care about the gameplay I
just want to win it might not matter
because you might get banned right now
they only seem to be temporary banning
people from about 45 minutes to 6 hours
depending on what happens you can
teleport to Central Park be banned for
45 minutes but then be in Central Park
and just play the game anyways but
they're currently very focused on making
sure that their servers don't just
evaporate from the obscene amount of
usage that's going on once that calms
down a little bit once they're managing
the load then they're going to hammer
down on people in the beta and in their
previous game ingress they were banning
the crap out of people for this stuff
now the bands aren't going to stop
people because the game is ludicrously
huge Nintendo stock price has gone up
30% since its launch days ago
apk mirror an unofficial place to
download the application for countries
that don't officially support it yet in
the Play Store an app store weight from
about 600,000 hits a day to over 4
freakin million there's even a rumor
going around saying that Nintendo is
making 1.6 million dollars a day just on
iOS just in the States off of Pokemon go
holy crap now for me this completely
breaks the game so I'll never do it if I
wanted to just sit on my couch and play
pokemon I would load up some version of
Pokemon on Gameboy and just play that it
would be a better overall experience but
knowledge is power so I'm still down
with making this video I don't think
anyone should use it if they can avoid
it if you're physically disabled and you
just want to play the game that your
friends are playing I think that's super
cool or if you have some other very good
reason if you just live in a rural area
man up and go for a long walk and you
can also use this information to call
out your friends
who you know are working like overtime
everyday but just got the game two days
ago and our level like 20 something with
huge crazy strong Pokemon I don't know
or you can use it as that fantastic
scapegoat anytime there's someone
stronger than you they probably just
cheated jerks alright guys thanks for
watching I'm probably going to have to
get back to work as I don't think Linus
is going to want to pay me for playing
Pokemon go all the time like the video
if you liked it I know it's not normally
what we do just like the video if you're
like I'm tired of everybody talking
about Pokemon go cuz that's valid check
out the link in the video description to
buy some stuff from Amazon cuz I don't
know because it's Amazon
I guess there's prime day going on and
stuff you can get good deals that exists
check out the link the video description
for our shirts which isn't this one this
is for transistor a video game that I
like to check out the forum if you want
to like yell at me for telling people
about how to cheat in Pokemon go people
are going to talk about eventually
anyways there's probably other
information online about it already
anyways it's not a big deal
uh and yeah I'll see you guys next time
watch this video on
I don't know Karen will decide probably
one of Terrence videos put like one of
your mobility videos in here turn by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
