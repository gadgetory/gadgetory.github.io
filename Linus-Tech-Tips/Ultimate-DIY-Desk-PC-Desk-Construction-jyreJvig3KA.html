father-son PC build on Linus tech tips
it's not the first time we've done a
multi-part video and it's not the first
time I have mounted a computer to a desk
but I assure you that today's video is
very different from anything you've seen
on this channel before this
collaborative project has been a long
time coming with many helpers and the
result and I think you'll all agree was
totally worth the effort welcome to
ultimate DIY desk PC
Rav powers 22,000 milliamp-hour portable
charger can charge up to three devices
at once while being the size of an
average smartphone check it out at the
link in the video description let's
begin with the objective there are a lot
of desk PC builds out there and even
prefabs desk PC cases but they all share
at least one trait the price some are
expensive due to their use of premium
materials while others are expensive
because they require a well-stocked
workshop and a lot of time to build them
this is different what we're building is
a from scratch design that we're calling
the LTTE d1 start for a desk one a
complete desk PC case that you can make
yourself with a single piece of MDF a
couple of saws and a piece of glass
let's start at the beginning the first
plan was to buy a cheap table from Ikea
or off Craigslist then build the rest of
the materials around that we rejected
that because almost nothing we did would
be applicable to someone trying to
replicate the project so we started
working from the other end what do all
sick looking desk PCs have in common a
big piece of glass so with some careful
measurements you can easily adapt our
design to whatever glass top you can
find second hand this is a big key for
this project because thick tempered
glass that's designed to sit without
being fully supported the kind that you
should use for safety is not cheap so
our glass measured twenty nine point
seven five inches by fifty seven point
three seventy-five and cost us forty
bucks for the entire table on Craigslist
we just discarded the legs and got to
work now to keep costs down the
objective was to build the desk out of a
single piece of MDF plywood is another
valid material choice here it's stronger
but we wanted a smooth clean look
something that might not matter to you
so here are the plans we used you can
see here that the largest cut of wood is
the bottom piece that will be covered by
the top glass just please note that if
you want your glass
to sit flush with the wooden box around
all the edges you'll need to add three
quarters of an inch on every side to
account for the thickness of the
material used to build besides we attach
them in this manner to hide what would
otherwise be unattractive seams around
the outside of the desk for the rest of
the cuts you see here we have a cut-off
saw and a table saw so we can work as we
go but if you don't you can get your
local Building Supply Store to cut them
for you
starting with the smallest pieces so the
operator will have more to hold on to
officially it costs a dollar per cut but
some places will do more for free if you
come in at a time when they're not busy
another sort of error that we made was
in the height of the box we made it
exactly the right height for
side-mounted 120 millimeter fans then
decided after the fact that we wanted a
3/4 inch lip around the edge for LED
lighting effects but it ended up working
out anyway because we changed our mind
about radiator mounting the next
important measurement is one of the
coolest things about this design the
knee cutout you can do pretty much
whatever you want here but the general
idea is to avoid the awkward arm
position that a thick table usually
forces the user into we started using a
jig saw with a ruler to guide it but and
this would have worked for plywood
because we aren't using plywood it made
our blade Bend and it actually worked ok
actually better to just draw a line and
eyeball it my dad wanted perfection
though and since he already owns a table
saw he brought that over to fix it up so
our knee cutout kind of got bigger and
bigger this was probably the hardest
part of building the desk but if you
have it pre-cut for you you shouldn't
run into that next up is the sides of
the box we originally tried to nail
these on but discovered that without
pre-drilling it wasn't going to work
very well due to the crumbly nature of
MDF the good news is that with wood glue
and clamps this stuff stays together
astonishingly well spoiler alert the
entire end product is held together
without a single screw or nail next up
is the legs one nice thing about
building your own custom desk is that
you can have the height perfect for
yourself we went with a 29 inch height
from the top of the glass to the floor
for our isosceles triangle reinforced
legs
the assembly here is a little tricky you
put the leg components together like so
then when the glue is grabbing a bit but
not hard it'll be about this color you
can wipe off the excess then we position
the legs at an angle for a bit of extra
strength they're supported at the top by
those trapezoid shapes an additional
brace here between them down lower
though would be a good idea but it's not
exactly weak without it next up is the
optional LED lip these are just thin
strips of wood that we clamped in place
around the outside edge to allow us to
light up the inside of the case without
being able to directly see the LEDs you
can actually get pretty perfect seams by
wiping the glue at the right moment
during the drying process but as you can
see ours isn't so in part two we may
have to address that somehow but how
does all the hardware go in well it
actually took us a while to figure that
out thank you well you just killed like
that that's awful
isn't that what you want everything
about what you just did there is awful
isn't that what you want to I'm not sure
yet let's just kind of back up for a
second here I think the things you have
cables I think the things should be
centered and we might just have to use
extensions for the connectors that we
need horsepower slightly I don't know
well what's going to go over here though
that's that sort of a concern right now
is this just going to be like a like a
diorama of like gaming figurines like
what are we going to put here what about
hard drives ah SATA cables that far I'm
not sure if that's a very good idea hole
right there so what's going on with the
legs well you guys did have a preference
so we decided to angle them for beauty
yeah so the desk itself will be
beautiful but the computer might not be
in there
you guys really should have thought this
through first you know what
Vaughn finding you Canada I'm supportive
right now hey I helped your dad build
this Deb that's true important that's
true that's supportive you did most of
the work yes yes we know he did do that
okay all right so hold on let's just
this can we put back here right there
and then the cables can have like that
nice look thing that comes here what's a
while okay
so we're thinking but again we are now
officially out of components to put over
there still have perfect we still have
reservoirs but your reservoirs are
really small no we can't put hard drives
over there Jake you can't run a SATA
cable that's like 15 miles long but one
we prefer where are we gonna put the
hard drives then hold on let's not get
too far away from ourself from what's
going on here so power supply can go out
and up where it ends up and up to where
that needs to go so that's fine then
sorry our YouTube mini-14 right oh yeah
yeah but cable model do completely
custom link so I'll just send them
exactly what we need then for this is
stuff that I'm actually kind of worried
about like how do you have your two here
you have an extender we do yes don't you
put this here let us click go like this
because you're still into really no
you're still good
no you're still gonna hit it what about
instead of using hard drives you can
just use SSDs are you sure hold on Jake
we might be okay here my dad might have
solved the problem are we planning to do
hard pipe fun we can Israel's kind of
all do you want to uh I don't think we
really it might look kind of ghetto if
we don't okay so we could do these here
we could go pump pump yeah and then we
could go res res we still end up with
some oh you know what no so we go like
res res and then we go how many hard
drives are there like for are they SSDs
I don't think we have a choice on that
one so basically we go up and we bring
this pump up no we can't no can't bring
the grumbles oh no no no that's fine
because we want to know we want to hit
the top of it okay so we go up to the
top of this pump then are we going to we
have a writing um but there are stills
there still the challenge of i/o so
power button I think is pretty I think
is pretty straightforward yeah we just
need to find like a couple cool LEDs and
power buttons that we can put in the
wood at the front right or we could just
do we could just do a hole and then just
have a piece of have a piece of wood
that cover that just comes out to cover
the cables that are plugged in yeah okay
let me just make it that simple so
basically we just a little lower case of
a little zip right here yeah it would be
a little tough but honestly I mean once
it's mounted it's not bored okay so if
that's the case then we'll do the exact
same thing here and then we'll do the
exact same thing here so actually would
we okay so how about this then would be
just cover okay so we have a plan now
and it only took until after the desk
was already basically finished being
constructed
and planning anyway so IO is going to go
here that's good because I'm
right-handed and it's good because the
user is going to sit right about here
ish kind of back a little bit you won't
really see that so we're going to just
bring our power button front USB blah
blah blah cetera a couple LEDs right up
there then CPU and GPU are both going to
have tubing going between them and then
over across here we're going to talk
we're going to try and do hard line
tubing wish me freaking luck with this
one anyway the point is you're going to
get over to these radiators they're
going to go to their pumps and both of
these pumps are going to be able to draw
air directly from a reservoir meaning
that we're not going to have issues with
leading the loop something that I have
definitely had to deal with in the past
these fans are going to have white
chrome acts corners so we're going to
have like a black and white color scheme
kind of thing going on in here and in
terms of power we're going to use custom
cable mod cables to go up over to here
over to here over to here similar to my
last desk PC and then we're going to
have we're going to use this lip under
here see that it goes all the way around
the outside to run power to these drives
and we're also going to have cable mods
SATA cables over to these drives from
this direction and then we're going to
run power over to the pumps and fans
over here hiding them under the lip as
best we can the other thing we're going
to run around the entire outside is RGB
LED strips though don't worry we're not
just going to go one solid strip around
the whole thing and make it like a like
a light show inside we're going to use
extensions to create gaps so we're just
accent lighting the right pieces that
was my idea Jake was not responsible for
that at all and ahh I mean yeah oh right
right right last thing so Shroud my dad
says it's pretty simple to kind of go
over here and then down and then over so
all we're going to do is put some holes
in the side so you can access your i/o
that makes this setup a little bit more
flexible for the future like oh I don't
necessarily want to use DisplayPort
anymore like if we used extensions to
get over there or something no no no
we're just going to have holes you can
reach in you can do whatever it is you
need to do now the keen-eyed among you
are probably asking yourselves gee Linus
well you got a bunch of exhaust fans
where are you drawing air in to which my
reply is don't worry about it
we have taken away the top we're not
going to put a piece of glass on it
anymore
new idea monitor balance is here okay
keyboard goes kind of right here and
then across here for stability while
gaming mouse get this you are going to
use the top of the water block of the
video card making you the world's
biggest badass that's stupid isn't it
yes okay so know the piece of glass is
still going over top but what we're
going to do is we're either going to use
like these Silverstone filters or maybe
we'll do like a custom sort of larger
mesh and we're going to do one intake
right here so because we're using high
static pressure fans over on the other
side we're actually going to have a
pretty decent amount of airflow sucked
through that filtered intake across the
motherboard down towards the power
supply and over here and then out down
here over on the left and that is how we
do it when we plan everything after the
fact oh yeah I didn't even explain the
disaster almost that was the radiators
so not having given my dad any guidance
in fact I said specifically I didn't
care he did these cool angled feet under
the desk that almost made it impossible
for us to mount these radiators over
here that's why they're kind of offset
like this but it it ended up looking
like yeah we meant to do that
so maybe we'll just leave this clip out
and then you'll never know that we
didn't mean to do that because that's
how video works kids so the last thing
here is we're doing a quick test fit of
the glass you can see the the
quarter-inch extra that we have around
now at this stage in the game you have a
couple of options you could rebuild your
table or you can actually just get glass
that is custom-made to fit exactly but
we're probably not going to worry about
that for the purposes of this video what
I did want to say though is now that
we've got this on here we've realized
you know
you can even with paint and even with
sanding like you're going to see some of
this
so when optional stuff at this stage
would be to put some kind of a veneer
over top of here so you don't really see
all these joins might make it look a
little sharper and then to keep the
glass from slipping and moving around
you might also want to consider putting
like maybe like a roll-on clear silicone
around the edge so that once you put it
down it kind of sticks in place let the
silicone dry first so it's just a grippy
like a grippy texture around the outside
so you'd actually be able to lift it
straight off you just won't be able to
slide it well this this chair is a
little tall that's not how high the
chair will be we'll check it out the
knees gap is right there boom that's
freaking awesome okay so we're going to
cover some of these imperfections like
right there so this is optional you
don't really need to do this because you
could have just painted that and once
you put the sort of friction surface
like silicone or some rubber surface you
wouldn't see these little marks anyway
but we decided to go with little bit of
in here so that's optional so anyway the
test fit with the glass looks awesome
other than the calculation error with
the outside edge so the next step then
is to see if we can get around our
half-ass planning and get all the
components actually mounted inside stay
tuned for part two I did say it was
going to be a multi-part er but maybe
