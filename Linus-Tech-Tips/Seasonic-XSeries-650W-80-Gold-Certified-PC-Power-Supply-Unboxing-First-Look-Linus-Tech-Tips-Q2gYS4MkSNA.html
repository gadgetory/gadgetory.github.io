at the see sonic x-series 650 watt power
supply now the front of this box is
pretty bare as you may or may not have
noticed it features advanced DC power
conversion technology for
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah and it is 80
plus gold that is the real draw for this
power supply series right there so that
means power supply efficiency of 87
percent or more regardless of the load
on it so that's pretty awesome actually
you should check out my video that I did
recently on my NCIX dot-com channel
where we talked about how much money you
can save in a year by using an 80 plus
gold power supply so you can see this
power supply has a single 12 volt rail
at 54 amps and it's capable of
outputting almost its entire 650 watt
maximum on the 12 volt rail let's move
around to the back where all of a sudden
the box design gets a lot busier so they
show you a little bit of the internal
design of the x-series 650 watt they
talked a little bit about their DC
connector module if integrated vrm
voltage regulator module there is your
80 plus gold spec so that means it's 87
ninety 87 percent at 20 50 and 100
percent operating loads so as high as 90
percent in what I would consider a
typical gaming system which would top
out around 300 Watts under load okay
silent fan control this is a big thing
for C sonic is they typically have very
very quiet power supplies so they're
using a sanyo Genki Sony's PWM silent
fan let me see this is a fully modular
it looks like no it couldn't be this is
a modular power supply it looks like it
might be fully modular you know what
we're gonna have to open it up to find
out so why don't we just do that it's
sli certified also I didn't mention that
before and oh not even sealed okay cool
so first we'll find an owner's manual
which ii re emphasize --is it is 80 plus
gold okay it's in five different
languages and gives us the basics tells
us thank you for purchasing I didn't
purchase one but you know you're you're
welcome anyway gives you a little bit of
information about the connectors that
are connected to it
they don't give you the rail breakdown
because because it's a single rail power
supply on the 12 volts so you don't have
to worry about what you're plugging in
where
whether it's going to overload a single
rail okay they talk about their
five-year warranty a little bit our
simple and effective own they even tell
you how to do an RMA if you have a DOA
unit that's really nice of them to
include that information
okay so then we've got a little full
note thing here let's see sonic logo
very nice box I really like it okay then
we have wow this is hey this is nice go
for gold and just in time for the
Olympics two x-series okay so Sonic it's
got two separate little oh wow
two separate little baggies which each
include modular cables I'm just gonna
dump these out yes there we go okay so
this is fully modular let's pull the
power supply out we've got a pretty
beefy looking power cord just your
standard computer power cord alright
then we have a little C Sonic case badge
powered by C Sonic and four K screws
just in case your case doesn't include
the case screws if that's the case then
yeah okay that joke got old really fast
okay so it comes in a little velvet bag
which makes it feel very high-end which
it is by the way I mean it's an 80 plus
gold 650 watt unit that should be all
you really need to know and it's kind of
got a unique look to it okay the first
thing you'll notice is that the accents
are in kind of a Goldy sort of finish so
you've got your basic specs here all of
your safety certifications all of your
testing all on this side of the unit
then at the front you will find the
fully modular interface and I'm going to
go ahead and oh this is weird look at
this so they've actually got the 24 pin
connecter consolidated down to only 16
pins so what that means that many of the
duplicated cables are probably each
plugging into just one pin because it
wouldn't matter because it's a single
rail power supply very interesting so
here we've got our peripheral IDE and
SATA connectors all along here up here
is our PCI Express and CPU a pin okay
here we have CPU and here we have
motherboard alright so we'll figure out
what all of that means in
oh man oh yeah down here we have the 120
millimeter pwm fan okay
temperature egg activated fan rotates
only when required right because a very
efficient power supply only needs to
turn on the fan when it gets overwhelmed
and since it's a fairly low wattage very
efficient power supply it's going to
mean that you've got far less excess
heat than you would have in a less
efficient unit so that fan probably
doesn't have to work very hard at all on
the back of the unit you find your
typical honeycomb grille with the power
switch and a power input for a deep
power cable
then on this side you'll find some C
Sonic branding with the x-series go for
gold branding there as well wow I'm
really tired today I'm repeating myself
a lot but what are you gonna do okay
let's see if I can figure out how to get
this open there we go
so here is the O so they didn't they
didn't actually consolidate this cable
down what they've done is they've made
two separate cables for some reason okay
so basically you plug it in like this
and then you plug it in like this I
cannot imagine why they've done it this
way but they did I'm sure there's a
reason for it somewhere and I don't know
what it is so that's your 24 pin cable
and here if you want to check the angle
there so it's reasonably long you're not
going to have trouble with this power
supply having any sort of short cable
problems where you can't actually reach
the important parts of your PC all right
let's look at what else we have included
for modular cables so you've got a four
pin CPU connector then you have oh this
is great I love these the the ones that
are sort of a single brick that you plug
in so this is four PCI Express and then
that goes out to two six plus two pin
PCI Express connectors so you've got two
of those so you can actually see sonic
has configured it so you can easily run
to high end graphics cards requiring as
many as two eight pin PCI Express
connectors each off of this power supply
so this cable right here did it did it
did it didn't Oh No maybe they haven't
I see what they've done so either you're
using 4-pin well you know what this is
one of the most confusing modular
interfaces I've seen ever okay I get it
so you can either have an 8 pin CPU
power connector here and then you can
add a second one and then you can have
only 2 PCI Express connectors or you can
run a motherboard that requires only a
single 8 pin and then you can have as
many as four PCI Express connectors so
they're limiting you with the connectors
a little bit to make sure that you don't
go ahead and overload this with like you
know that newly BGA board that has 2 LGA
1366 sockets and supports like 7
graphics cards you wouldn't want to be
running that on a 650 watt power supply
so they're protecting consumers a little
bit that way all right so in terms of
the other modular cables we have we've
got one with three Saito another one
with three SATA another one probably
with three SATA and guessing yeah
there's another one so you can connect
up to oh no that one has only two so you
can connect up to eight SATA hard drives
natively on this power supply and then
I'm gonna go see what I dropped here
okay this is an adapter oh ok so they
haven't actually included any floppy
connectors on the modular cables by
default but you can use this adapter to
get a couple floppy connectors if you
want that then we have 8 4 pin molex
connector so you can plug in as many as
five altogether of the molex and SATA
connectors thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the see sonic x-series 80
plus gold power supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
