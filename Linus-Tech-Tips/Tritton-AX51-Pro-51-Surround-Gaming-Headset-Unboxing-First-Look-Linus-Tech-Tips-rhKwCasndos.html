having a look at a product that i have
to confess i do not have a lot of
experience with this category i have
never used a set of surround sound
headphones but by request i'm having a
look at the ax 51 pro from tritton this
is an analog 5.1 surround sound 3d
directional precision gaming headset so
basically their whole thing is that they
have four speakers in each one of these
ear cups they have a center channel a
front channel and a rear channel as well
as a sub woofer in each side so that
means that you've actually got a full
analog output so a lot of the 5.1 zout
there do use drivers and they use
software emulation or whatever else or
they might even connect by USB but this
one actually just uses your conventional
Mike front center sub and then rear
speaker jacks so it just plugs right
into your sound card alright so let's
just have a look at their packaging here
so in the package you can see the
outline all of the features which
includes where the speakers are
positioned in a traditional 5.1 setup ok
thanks for that it shows that you can
independently control each sound field
by the backlit inline controller so
that's kind of nice ok you can have a
look at that and then what else do we
have here ok you can plug two of them
into the ax pro 2 game with a friend on
a console why ever you'd want to do that
I'm not a hundred percent sure you can
interchange the earcup padding you can
change the headrail padding you can
change it has a removable flexible
microphone and it has an xbox live port
okay I'm guessing that's why you would
want to use it with a friend if you're a
console gamer and then it did it did it
did it today ok that's pretty much
everything that we got here so why don't
we get started on opening this thing up
and I hope that my knife is handy
because otherwise this is going to be a
somewhat problematic there it is I do
have my blade alright there we go so
let's get this open and open it up I'm
gonna try and update with annotations
once I've had a chance to try these
things because I have to confess I am a
little bit curious how the whole 5.1
headphone thing works I've never tried
it before
i have used 5.1 speakers and then i have
used to you know your standard stereo
headphones for gaming but just never
this way oh actually there's something
that I did want to show that was in here
that I didn't have a good look at so
this is the speaker configuration within
the earphones so you can kind of have a
look I can't tell which is which just
off start at the top of my head here but
i'm guessing the big one is the sub and
the small ones are not for one thing all
right inside we have a what is this okay
product registration as well as a quick
start guide this is a quick start guide
okay so it shows you how to plug in your
analog connections how to use the little
in line thing they're actually powered
oh that's interesting so you have an AC
Jack that plugs into your headphones Wow
okay and then slide bed okay yeah okay
that's interesting Quick Start Guide
Thank You training okay and then we have
in here we have a little booklet that
shows you others written products okay
there we go so that's what's in there
other stuff that you can also buy from
them and then we get down to the product
itself so here is what I'm assuming is
the AC adapter yeah so that's it that's
a reasonable size adapter right there
that's like pretty big okay so that
plugs right into the headphones
themselves and then we can take off the
only see what else is in here there's
got to be more stuff right it's gonna be
more stuff ah ok so in one of the boxes
inside we find okay we find an analog
set of inputs connected to a custom
connector here okay so that's a little
adapter there for us okay and then we
have oh this is the mic okay so it's
kind of flexible see you can bend the
mic and it'll stay where you sort of put
it okay so that plugs into the bottom of
one of the ear cups all right and then
we have a couple of exchangeable ear
cups as well as an exchangeable piece
for the for the top of the head for the
top of the headset okay so if you don't
find the stock one comfortable you can
change it to that that's very nice ok
and then that pretty much does it for
our
trees all right so let's get this open
and I get it okay so all the
exchangeable ones there that I just
looked at those are kind of leathery
ones whereas the ones that actually come
on the headphones are far more of a
cloth type okay so I'm just trying to
get this out of the box here wow that is
a nice long cord I like to see that
actually because if you have a long cord
than you won't run out of boys please
sit far away from your computer while
you're gaining you're doing whatever
else it anyway okay pull that through
there then we're finally getting to the
point where we can talk about this thing
a little bit so at the end of the long
cord you'll find that custom connector
right here okay so that plugs in to
adapt to the to the 7.15 excuse me 5.1
and then you've got the DC in okay so
that's for our AC adapter and then
here's our inline controller okay so it
gives us a little color coding color
scheme code thing so red is the max I on
is high white is medium blue is low and
green is the minimum all right it's not
I'm really good to know and then we have
a little volume control thing right here
on the side okay and then over here Oh
voice volume that's nice most of these
I've seen only have on off but this
actually has a volume slider for that
and then this is to join the microphone
on and off just right there okay so then
you can press each of the buttons and
it's color-coded for how high you've got
the volume very cool there's your xbox
360 Jack right there at the bottom and
now let's have a look at the headset
itself so first of all I should figure
out which way it goes out the labels are
on the inside here so you can see that's
the right earcup so I'll just put like
that okay so it adjusts at the top just
like most headsets and it's quite
adjustable it can be adjusted quite far
so even if my head was like this big
then it would fit quite comfortably but
I'm probably gonna have it at about the
medium setting just like that it's
really it's kind of heavy actually is my
first observation but I guess it has to
have some weight to it if you're going
to be able to stuff all of that extra
electronics and speaker gear inside I
mean I guess there's not a whole lot to
say about it it seems pretty pretty well
built I wouldn't expect it to break if
you accidentally
drop it off your desk or do anything
like that I can't figure out just sort
of like right now immediately how to
change out the oh yeah okay so these
just come off like that okay that was
pretty simple so you can take off the
cloth ones you can replace it with the
plaid everyone's oh and you can see
there there there's a way better view of
the speaker configuration so you can see
where all of the speakers are inside of
the earphones or headphones excuse me
and then this one I guess is oh I don't
want to break this okay I can't really
figure out how to take this one off but
yeah you can exchange this one with the
plastic you want as well okay so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
tritton ax 51 pro 5.1 headphones so
that's really uncomfortable without the
foam piece there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
