series 9 970 monitor this thing is just
yeah it's pretty much as maxed out as it
gets when it comes to a monitor so it
uses you know I'm not going to talk too
much about what's on the inside cuz
we're gonna open the box and we'll see
that at some point so experience color
like never before they've got their
natural color expert as well as plain to
line switching technology this is a pls
panel I've made it very clear in the
past I'm a huge fan of pls panels which
are at this point exclusive to Samsung
they are gorgeous whether it's on the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 that in my personal
subjective opinion has the best screen
out of any tablet that I've seen to date
or or if it's on there other pls panels
which are they have one available in 24
inch and one that's available in a
smaller size 1 billion colors
ok wqhd 2560 by 1440 it's not quite 2560
by 1600 but I'll let it slide this is an
LED backlit monitor on the back you're
gonna see some more sort of glamor shots
of the monitor itself but since we're
gonna open it up we don't worry too much
about that on this side we see the
actual model code which is LS 27 B 9 7 0
d s /en just like I don't know if if I
was gonna name this monitor I just call
it like you know the junk destroyer or
something like that because just calling
it like a series of numbers and letters
doesn't do it justice so we're gonna
take a quick look at the packaging
inside then we're gonna open this one up
off camera just so that you guys can
instead of watching the open packaging
for most of the video you can bask in
the glory of this gorgeous monitor I've
already seen it outside of the box so
we're cheating a little bit here but
what are you gonna do cuz they're dual
link DVI cable included HDMI cable I
wouldn't use that yeah use the dual link
DVI cable I display for a cable that
one's okay probably included like every
cable USB A to B as well as HDMI to mini
HDMI wow they really include
everything you need to hook it up user
manual in their hard phone but I don't
expect it being a problem
it weighs what it weighs so unlike
computer cases which once you load them
up the part where become a bit of a
shipping hazard it's not really a
concern yeah this thing is a thing of
beauty so we're gonna go ahead and
unveil it on camera here absolutely
beautiful they'll pretty much all of
Samsung's nine series products are just
marvels of manufacturing at the end of
the day I mean we've got one of their
other nine Series monitors over there
that we took a look at a while back
that's a 3d monitor again just just
gorgeous so this one brings a few new
things to the table and I apologize for
not having it hooked up to anything
we're gonna do a full MPX tech tips on
this one later so it uses edge to edge
glass this is an anti reflective glass
that is on here and that means that yeah
basically there's there's no seam
there's no shadow from the bezel there's
no you know the bezel masking the very
the very edge of it or anything like
that it's just one gorgeous piece of
glass and then a pls panel underneath of
it it has a five millisecond delay which
is actually pretty good for a high color
accuracy panel and it also uses a
dimension 2560 by 1440 res I think I did
yeah I did okay 178 degree viewing angle
which is pretty much what I would expect
from PLS display as well as two speakers
so it has seven watt times two speakers
I'm not sure where the other they are
right there on the bottom seven Watts
times two
it also has minimum 90% uniformity that
is built into the spec and now let's
take a closer look at the rest of the
display so it's very thin we're gonna do
ye olde iPhone comparison to check out
the the thinness of the display itself
so it's about double the thickness of an
iPhone which is just stunning compared
to I have one of Samsung's old high-res
displays the 305 t plus at home and
compared to to that this looks just like
space-age but I'm not going to top-grade
not yet no I am bit I'll stick with the
305 teeth for a little while longer in
terms of the overall build quality it's
just outstanding so back here we find
the same kind of brushed looking plastic
back that they have on the Galaxy Tab I
am a huge fan of this finish I actually
prefer it to brushed aluminum and the
reason for that is that it is way more
durable way more scratch resistant it is
also far less likely to get stained and
ugly you can clean it a lot more easily
we've got a hide adjust and so it goes
all the way from down there 12 the way
up here I'm gonna turn around to do it
again so slick don't worry too much
about that and the stand again is just a
piece of art because it's got you know
like just like a shiny chrome II thing
going on and then like concentric circle
sort of effect going on on the top
they've really gone all out this is uh
this is sort of a this is sort of an
interesting like artsy type design so
the monitor seems to hover if when you
put it down it seems to kind of sit on
nothing and that's because falling away
from the the top silver piece here sorry
guys this is a show sample falling away
from the top silver piece here is like a
black base that includes a USB to USB
2.0 ports which are fed by this this USB
B connector here DisplayPort DVI and
HDMI in are all accepted as well as
power right there there's some
ventilation on the bottom for some of
those internal electronics because
there's no small amount of electronic
wizardry that goes into building such
high resolution displays here we can see
the construction again this is all metal
here no plastic up here at the top other
than the backing which once again I told
you guys I prefer that to aluminum just
gorgeous you can see the fit and finish
of it is just immaculate top and it's
not even that heavy like I can I can
hold it with one hand fairly easily so
it's I should tell you guys something
about the weight in spite of the glass
panel so that's very very that's that
most of the weight of the top here you
got your Samsung logo on there I mean
that's pretty much all there is to say
until we have a chance to fire it up so
here let's uh let's just finish up your
oh right touch sensitive buttons right
oh we so you can select
source and navigate your menu with
little touch sensitive buttons here
pretty cool right okay so no pivot for
this guy although we do have tilt oh
sorry sorry we do not tell actually you
should be looking at this from the side
anyway so then we have this much tilt
and then the height adjust I promise to
show that from the front goes all the
way down to there and all the way up to
there so that looks like a bow hmm 4 or
4 inches 5 inches of height adjust so
thank you for checking out our unboxing
of the 970 series 9 monitor from Samsung
once again key talking points 2560 by
1440 pls display with one seamless glass
front that I think is beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
