plastic off the new GTX 1080s
and revealed the fact that we had the
baddest graphics card on the block when
BAM Nvidia hits us upside the freaking
head with its new flagship the Pascal
based Titan X like a salmon that
suddenly flies out the river and just
smack see right in the face
indeed the timing of the release was so
soon after that 1080 that so many of us
were surprised but we were able to get
our hands on one just before I could
swim away so let's put it through its
paces and see just what kind of a beast
we're dealing with Intel skull Canyon
nook features a 6th generation Core i7
processor and Thunderbolt 3 learn more
at the link in the video description so
the Titan XP is loaded with awesome new
features including USB 2.0 support the
ability to burn things onto a CD and
full y2k compliance wait what ok well
not really but many people have decided
to call the new Titan X the XP with P
standing for Pascal to distinguish it
from the older Titan X which was based
on the Maxwell architecture I'm not
exactly sure why Nvidia recycled the
name maybe they decided that the letter
X was just too good of a hype train for
them to get off of I mean I understand
that that's not the only similarity to
the Maxwell Titan X as the two cards
look quite alike with their black cooler
shroud however the Titan XP does have a
bit of an updated aesthetic carrying
over the angular look from the rest of
the geforce 10 series as well as a
smoother plastic finish and the full
Titan X name proudly displayed on the
left side you also get a metal finish on
both the heatsink fins and the center of
the blower style fan instead of black as
well as a backplate which was absent on
the original overall I think the card
has a slightly more premium look than
its predecessor but of course that's a
matter of taste for connectivity you get
one HDMI 2.0 B port one dual link DVI i3
DisplayPort 1.4
connectors meaning you can output an 8k
60 Hertz signal if you've got something
like a multi 4k set up then there's also
an SLI connector which supports the new
high bandwidth SLI bridges you'll need
one eight pin and one six pin power
connector to power said Titan XP as well
but let's talk about the heart of this
monster the GP 102 GPU which continues
with the geforce ten theme of lower
numbered GPUs being more powerful
although the Titan X's GP 102 runs at a
slightly lower boost clock than a 1080
it makes up for this with a whopping
3584 CUDA cores over a thousand more
than the 1080 perhaps a little
surprisingly this still isn't even the
final form for the GP 102 as the Titan
XP has some of the GP 102 s CUDA cores
disabled you'll need to pick up the new
Quadro P 6000 if you want the full fat
GP 102 experience but of course that
isn't going to matter much unless you're
doing something like rendering the
sequel to James Cameron's Avatar as the
Titan XP is an insanely powerful card in
its own right
like the Maxwell Titan X you get 12
gigabytes of vram but this is the faster
gddr5 X with a bandwidth of 480
gigabytes per second we still don't have
HBM - but this V Ram configuration makes
this card firmly aimed at GPU computing
more specifically nvidia is marketing
the titan XP as a deep learning card in
case you're unaware deep learning is
somewhat of a recent buzzword for using
artificial neural networks to solve
complex problems using lots of virtual
nodes that perform calculations in
layers loosely modeled on how our brains
work kind of sort of highly parallelized
chips like the GP 102 that contained
tons of compute cores are quite good for
this type of work which has applications
and everything from language and facial
recognition to the life sciences to
helping driverless cars learn how to
deal with obstacles and hazards on the
road
which nvidia perhaps not coincidentally
also are working on now I know most of
you aren't developing bioinformatics
algorithms at home so let's talk about
game performance instead the Titan XP
beats out the gtx 1080 by about 10 FPS
or even more in every game that we
tested firmly establishing it as the new
heavyweight champ but with a couple of
caveats this still can't get always
60fps in 4k in every scenario with the
settings completely cranked so if you've
got a bunch of money burning a hole in
your pocket for no apparent reason and
you want to push that many frames to
your 4k monitor at those unnecessary
settings you might be better off with
two gtx 1080s in sli especially as 12
hundred US dollars the Titan X fees new
retail price is exactly about twice the
price of a 1080 now that's going to be
give or take depending on your region
but still it isn't the best bang for the
buck card in terms of frame rates and I
don't think anyone expected it to be
with the name of Titan that isn't to say
that the Titan XP doesn't have its place
if you're more of a prosumer who does
GPGPU stuff at home or you want the
extra vram for your ridiculous monitor
setup that would require that the Titan
XP is definitely worth a look but if you
just want extra gaming performance
you'll almost certainly be better off
waiting for the potential GT X 1080 Ti
in the previous generation the 980 TI
offered frame rates very close to the
original Titan X for a much lower price
so if Vidia does roll out a 1080 TI
somewhat soon it will likely be the
Green Teams
top-end card of choice for nearly all PC
gamers that want to spend a whack ton of
money but if you have the money in your
budget the Titan XP would be an
incredible addition to your arsenal and
would look even more impressive in your
battle station than that bliss wallpaper
that came with Windows XP if you liked
this video like it and get subscribed
and if you dislike it stop the ever
living crap out of the dislike button
just like repeatedly press it a lot
until you
really tired and then I think your point
we'll probably get across by then if you
want to buy some stuff that you saw in
this video go to Amazon and do that if
you want to get a shirt you can also
click a link in the video description
down below like the Amazon one that is
down there somewhere and you can buy one
of those if you want to talk about
things you can go on the forum and dock
your heart away instead of clicking the
dislike button for like six hours you
could ratatatatata about your feelings
as well also if you want to see another
video check out this one
it's our DT X 1080 review a card that is
probably much more value than the GTX or
the Titan X even though it's still
really expensive so if you just got to
spend a bunch of money you can pick one
of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
