with Sony Vegas over the last probably
year or so I really like the way the
software works but it's been incredibly
buggy for me so one of the solutions
that I found was to use power director
which honestly just feels like feels
like a child's toy to me compared to a
tool like Sony Vegas even though I'm not
using professional I am using no I don't
want to do that I am using Sony Vegas
what's it called movie studio Platinum
just because between that one and
PowerDirector I spent a couple hundred
dollars on anything soft for a little
while so anyway I'm very much prefer to
work with Vegas but I've had some
problems with rendering so whenever I'm
trying to do high quality files longer
files files with a lot of different
transitions are a lot of different
effects basically it's just timing out
in the rendering so what I determined
that this was to do with because a lot
of the time me about 60% of the time it
gives me an error that says something
about not enough available memory well
news flash for you Sony Vegas my system
has 24 gigs of memory so yes I don't
think that's the problem what the
problem actually is is that Sony Vegas
is a 32-bit program on the
non-professional version so even though
I'm running a 64-bit OS I'm only getting
access to 2 gigs of memory for that
program so I've finally tracked it down
to that is the problem and I found a
great little blog post on a site called
Nick techies e're and they have a link
to where is it here it is great little
program right here it's on nt chord calm
slash 4gb underscore patch dot PHP I
have now used it it took about two
seconds to patch Sony Vegas movie studio
platinum in order to render my wedding
video which I'm going to be putting up
on my Linus cat tips channel I'm gonna
put it up for a little while I'm not
sure how long I'll leave it there but
there you go it has solved a problem
that I've had
Vegas for quite a while and I just
thought I'd give a shout out to I mean I
have no idea who these guys are NT cork
Tom sugar one month yeah so if you ever
have a problem where you're running into
memory issues on the system that clearly
has enough memory in a multimedia type
program or 3d rendering or whatever the
case may be or very large Excel files if
you accidentally installed the 32 gig
version or 32-bit version of Office then
this could fix your problems so thank
you for checking out this little Linus
tech tip and</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
