variants of pretty much the same thing I
also still have my microphone on but
that's from shooting NCIX tech tips over
there the microphone is on the camera um
not really really into anything this is
an TX accent lighting USB powered 6 LED
strip thing so you can see they got a
couple examples for how they might
expect you to use it and a couple more
examples I'm going to read the back
because that is apparently what I do on
the show show off your PC in a new light
with the Antec advanced accent lighting
USB powered 6 LED strip easy to install
and turn on simply attach the LED strip
on the electronic device you desire
insert the USB plug into an open USB
port or powered USB hub and then turn it
on with its convenient on/off switch
imagine turning on your computer and
suddenly a glow emanates from within
your case or having your entire your
entire desk illuminate the moment your
keyboard activates if you think your
components desk or even monitor need a
healthy glow pick up the enttec advanced
lighting red USB powered 6 LED strip
today now I sort of exaggerated I made
fun of that a little bit and rightfully
so
however it is pretty cool so let's check
this out we've got the red version as
well as the blue version here today and
I'm going to show you guys a couple of
examples of what we can do with a
product like this that will look pretty
sweet so one thing to note is that you
don't actually have to use the strip in
its entire length there are cutting
marks on here so you can see there you
can cut it off at either 2 4 or the
entire 6 depending on how you want to
place it although you'll have to
reconsider the the connectors if you
want to that do if you want to cut them
you'll have to resolder on power
connectors as you can see here not there
somewhere else you'll have to figure it
out on your own because I'm not doing
that guide let's plug one of these in
and let's see how it goes here so I'm
going to leave the switch powered off so
there's the convenient
on/off switch just so that we have the
drama of turning it on all at once so
you can plug it into a USB port on your
motherboard you know what actually this
is a terrible example let me just think
if there's somewhere else that I can you
know what give me a sec your guess so
let's start with keyboard lighting
effects here we've got a Corsair k9t and
we're going to go ahead and add some
under glow how beastly does that look
yeah pretty pretty good pretty good so
remember guys you can plug it into the
USB port on a keyboard or other
peripheral actually here let's go ahead
and try it on a monitor oh hold on it
probably has to be powered on
yeah yeah so here check the subjective
come over from the other side so you can
set it up on like the bottom of your
monitor and illuminate your desk under
the monitor
I apologize for us not really having
like a proper place like a proper system
or anything to set this up on that
actually looks that's about what it
looks like that looks really good okay
now let's go ahead and remember that
we'll only power on when your monitor is
actually receiving an input signal which
is pretty neat you can even use it to
pick your test bench so you can plug it
anywhere where there's USB power which
just makes things very flexible so you
could throw it onto one of your USB s
here and then you could stick it to the
bottom of your test bench and it would
like illuminate all of your testing
equipment which would make you feel
pretty cool there we go let's just fix
that there you go so now my power supply
and my SSD and my pink anti-slip mat
that I put on top of my optical drive
can all bask in the red glow of the
Antec accent strip these are actually
really cool it's just I mean these LED
strips have existed already it's not
like this is anything new but all
enzymes done is put just a nice clean
black cable an on/off switch and let's
again clean heat-shrink cabling here
then some adhesive on it and you can use
it to accent pretty much whatever you
want it's a nice long cable so the whole
thing is almost six feet long seem like
that thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the antique advanced accent
lighting available and at least red and
blue and I'm not sure if there are other
colors as well don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips for unboxings reviews
and other computer videos now remember
guys I said anything with USB power so
if you happen to have one of these handy
little doodads all you got to do is put
them in your pocket and you are ready to
LED accessorize yourself for your
upcoming you know I don't know party
where they wear like hats like this
that was it we're done
