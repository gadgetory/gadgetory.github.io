2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair alright guys we're here at the
Intel booth right now checking out the
Alienware 18 it's a pretty interesting
laptop first of all it's huge
second of all it's outputting to a 4k
screen here on the floor playing fat man
and it's quite smooth I had no real
problems playing the game and that's
impressive but what's really impressive
about this laptop is the processor it's
running an Intel 4940 MX and at stock
this processor runs at about 3.1
gigahertz which is pretty cool and stuff
but then when it turbos it goes up to
4.0 gigahertz which is beast but then
what's really interesting is this isn't
an Intel Extreme Edition so it's more
perk lockable and in this chassis stock
no additional crazy cooling or anything
like that they were able to get this
processor at over 5 gigahertz by
overclocking that's insane usually I
don't even like overclocking laptops
because their thermal how they deal with
thermals is not that advanced and they
can't really get rid of that much heat
but this laptop seems to be able to do
it and with his extreme edition it's
able to capture those performance levels
