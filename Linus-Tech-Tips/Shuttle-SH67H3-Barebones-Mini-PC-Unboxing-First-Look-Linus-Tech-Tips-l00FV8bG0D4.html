that is just to say one of their small
form-factor pcs some shuttles been
making a name for themselves for many
many years making systems custom systems
even bare-bones systems whether it's
complete comes with all the stuff or not
completely doesn't come with all the
stuff they are building small boxes
small motherboards and small power
supplies non-standard smaller than you
can build on your own and that is their
advantage so they are able to provide
these custom solutions that you can then
add whatever you want to and you can
have a pretty neat little system out of
it so this particular one right here is
the SH 67 h3 based on the name we can
surmise that it uses the H 67 chipset
which means that you have full support
for all the latest Intel Core i3 Core i5
and core i7 processors on the LGA 1155
platform that's what it says here age 67
a chipset supports up to 95 watt CPUs
which is the maximum I believe available
on that platform dual channel ddr3 up to
1333 megahertz is supported up to 16
gigs HDMI and DVI are both supported
remember the age 67 has onboard video
but does not support the unlocked
overclocking feature of the K series
processor so watch out for that if
you're planning on overclocking this
solution probably isn't for you it's
more for low power consumption low
footprint small footprint type systems
alright one PCIe 16x slot so you can
build a pretty decent gaming machine in
this support for USB 3 and SATA 3 6
gigabit per second as well as 7.1 high
definition audio expansion capabilities
to 3 and a half inch hard drive bays one
five and a quarter inch bay 80 plus 300
watt power supply so that's going to be
enough for pretty much whatever you want
to add to it remember this is a smaller
motherboard there's not a lot of room
for expansion a 300 watt power supply is
gonna easily deal with that CPU and then
pretty decent peripherals are pretty
decent component
in terms of ramen and expansion cards as
well as a decent video card I felt just
take it on the box here and have a look
at what there is to see I don't think
I've ever unboxed the shuttle on my
channel before although I've been
following their products for a long time
and I do find them quite interesting
although I've never had cause to build
one for myself I have been tempted many
times just because they're cool little
things and it's it was fascinating to me
especially when they launched their X 58
X PC that you could put such a
ridiculous amount of power in such a
small package all right so here we are
here's the SH 67 and you know what
you're probably gonna have to give me a
minute here all the hold on give me
second I must be able to figure this out
relatively quickly because I do want to
take off be actually not give me a
second our gloves the reason for that
this brushed aluminum finish I love this
finish but I also hate it because it
looks fantastic but it is a fingerprint
magnet and it's almost impossible to
remove fingerprints from it so I'd
rather not get any on it in the first
place so I've taken off the cover you
can see there are vents in the side it's
got a very nice overall finish to it it
seems to be made of aluminum so very
nice very nice indeed all right so let's
have a quick look at the front of the
case so we've got esata/usb combo port
two USB 3.0 ports a microphone port
headphone port as well as a reset switch
there's also you gotta be kidding me
where's the there's the power switch I'm
sure it's somewhere hold on just a
minute
okay give me a second nope
power switches over here it was hiding
from me a little silver button up here
okay we found it it's all good all right
in here we have some do not eat don't
eat it okay here's our five and a
quarter inch expansion Bay here's our
two three and a half inch bays so you
can put a pretty decent amount of
storage in here even though it's a tiny
little case here are all the power
supply cables which I will show you in a
minute
oh here we go so what do we got oh look
at that they've custom wired in the SATA
cables already so the SATA cables are
included one two SATA cables and then
you can see they've actually run them up
here to the top corner so what that
means is you'll be able to easily plug
these into the back of any devices here
now those are the SATA can't see what
Payments neither they are but here are a
couple more SATA ports should you so the
desire them we've also got oh there's
some pretty interesting stuff in here so
look here's a little laptop style PCIe
1x slot so you could use that for a
wireless card for example if you wanted
to run wireless on your X PC machine
move these oh yeah no there's your for
ddr3 slots supporting up to 16 gigs of
dual channel ddr3 you can see the 24 pin
power connector has been wired in at the
very other side there and here are all
of our front panel connectors are all
already wired in so basically what a
bare-bones does is it allows people who
aren't necessarily comfortable building
their own system from scratch to skip
all the difficult stuff motherboard
mounting power supply connections front
panel connections and all you got to do
is plug in your RAM plug in your CPU
plug in your graphics card in your
drives and you're ready to go alright
speaking of the CPU you can see that
there is a custom cooler on it so you've
got some fins on the top okay
oh it says warning do not use a CPU with
power consumption level of 95 Watts
because that's what this cooler is
validated for okay you're going to want
to remove these four screws and you can
access those by removing these screws
and pulling out the drive mounting okay
and then the way that it's actually
cooled is by heat pipes and the whole
system is cooled by one
really no two fans so there's a 192
millimeter fan here that's a nice thick
fan good static pressure and then that's
running off of a radiator style cooler
here in the back so that's your exhaust
fan and then your power supply this is
an 80 plus bronze 300 watt power supply
also has a fan so that's two fans for
the entire system three if you put in a
high-end graphics card so let's have a
look at what we've got four PCI or
rather you got PCIe power connector so
we have a single PCIe six pin so that
means that you're probably going to be
limited to something along the lines of
the gtx 550 ti although there's no
reason the 300 watt power supply
couldn't support a 560 TI as long as
space permits you know what i'm going to
go ahead and I'm gonna I'm gonna grab a
graphics card here and see what all we
can actually fit here I probably won't
be long for this Oh give me two seconds
here's a 460 Twin Frozr - so this is a
pretty long card and see if this will
fit this is a touch longer than a
regular gtx 560 but yeah you can see
that'll fit with no difficulty so the
power connectors here at the back are
definitely going to have enough room to
be reached so if you use molex adapters
you can easily run that off of this
power supply you have three SATA power
connectors so that supports here at four
rather it supports your full complement
of drives one floppy connector and then
you're gonna use both of those molex
connectors if you wanted to run a dual
PCIe 6 pin graphics card like this one
if you run a single slot graphics card
you do have an additional PCIe 1x slot
inside so that would be far like a yeah
wireless card or a TV tuner card or
whatever the case may be
there you go total of two PCI expansion
slots at the back so that is a little
bit more than ITX okay oh yeah back ok
so here we've got DVI and HDMI out two
USB 3.0 ports so that makes a total of
four for USB 2.0 ports eSATA Gigabit LAN
and 7.1 audio out there's no microphone
part here remember this fully custom
motherboard so it's designed to work
like how they intend for it to work so
your microphone port is here also at the
back we have optical audio out which I
almost didn't see they're moving over to
the other side you can see how the power
supply specs pan oh we've got dual
12-volt rails rated to up to 16 amps
each this is looks like f SP is the OEM
for this so it's probably going to be
reliable and awesome in every way
alright 80 plus bronze active PFC ball
bearing fan so it should be yeah these
are all good things for reliability as
well as low noise and low power
consumption here is the heatsink for the
PWM as well as the four pin CPU power
connector located in its ideal location
exactly where ever shuttle decides it
goes because really I can't speculate on
what the ideal location is in this case
alright I think that's pretty much it
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of do I forget no sh-60 7h3 you don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
from our unboxings reviews and other
computer videos boom boom and I forgot
to show you guys the quick guide as well
as the mounting screws cable ties
thermal compound CPU socket cover and
driver DVD that is included with this
