feature showcase honestly this was one
of the things about slicks resume that
really popped out at me because he
actually put this on his resume he was
like one of a computer that's lik
oil-cooled and I was like okay I guess
and so I had to talk to this guy of
course right because who puts that on a
resume I was like I really hope this is
a custom resume I hope you don't like
apply for a job at like a car dealership
and you're like I have an oil cooled
computer because they'd be like okay
well is like for cars and stuff no we're
not talking motor oil we're talking
mineral oil so this is slicks oil cooled
machine which is actually still running
after all this time so this is back when
a 780i i qx60 708 gigs of corsair
dominator what the heck is this stuff
8500 memory so this is somehow he
managed on a 780i board to get four dims
working by some freaking miracle is the
thing overclocks to a little bit yeah a
little bit exactly because that's not an
easy feat I can tell you guys that much
GeForce GTX 260 you see you can see the
DD C or DD C plus up and what it is is
some kind of pump going on in there you
can also see he's got like seriously
this thing is old school that legit
hardware checkers up hx6 20 modules
applied with all of the casing stripped
off so even the fan is gone however you
can see from the tubing coming in here
that he's got the fresh coolant coming
in near the power supply so I think he
recognizes that the power supply would
be one of the more disastrous things to
go wrong in a mineral oil cooled
computer so one of the questions that a
lot of people have about oil cooling is
why does this work and not water because
you always hear people say well
deionized water is non-conductive and it
is but the difference is that the
ionized water is also very aggressive in
picking up ions from metal that is
placed in it so whether it's an
heatsink or whether it's a copper you
know exposed portion of a PCB or
whatever else the case may be that
distilled or deionized water is going to
pick up ions like that and it'll
probably short out within about ten or
fifteen minutes whereas mineral oil is
much more inert and is much easier to
have running on a long-term basis so
this has been running pretty much
non-stop other than an incident where
there was some kind of a party at the
dorm that he was staying in and someone
broke the bottom of it or something
along those lines that be refilled other
than that it's been running pretty much
non-stop all this time now if he had a
bigger reservoir he could probably run
it without an external radiator but due
to the fact that he's using a fairly
compact case you guys come here and look
at it from the top you can see it's only
about an ATX mini tower size case it's
actually probably even smaller than that
this is more like an M ATX case because
the power supply instead of being
mounted here or on the bottom is
actually just like gano mounted near the
memory most cases are not designed this
way so what he's done is he's used a
quadruple so it's a four by 120
millimeter ghetto sauce radiator album
it is a fake radiator so in terms of
performance it's going to be darn close
to something like a thermal chill
quadruple radiator
he's got 3/8 inch tubing which by the
way is very stiff the mineral oil has
some interesting effects on your
hardware including stiffening up cables
that it can it creeps its way up so
it'll stiffen cables stiffen tubing and
it can be a bit of a challenge that way
now if only solid state drives had been
feasible at the time that he built this
machine you probably wouldn't have to
have a mechanical drive here but you can
actually see there's a mechanical hard
drive right there hiding under yep
hiding under this lip because mechanical
hard drives are one of the few
components along with optical drives you
can see he uses an external optical
drive do not sell the fit are you
kidding me are one of the few components
they cannot run in mineral oil due to
the fact that they would just die
instantly so uh so yeah you know the oil
inside the hard drive would be really
bad for the 7200 rpm spinning
they would slow down a lot um which is
bad so anyway so he went with a hard
drive an SSD however could run inside
here just fine now speaking of things
slowing down in the mineral ah you can
see that it is still sort of fan cooled
in spite of the fact that there's
there's mineral oil going on inside here
these fans have slowed down however due
to the properties of the mineral oil
they actually are not damaged by this I
mean they're running in lubricant so
it's not the end of the world to have
them to have them running submerged like
this I'm just trying to see if I've
missed anything the decorative plant is
fantastic of course and so is his he
actually doesn't own a single cooter
thing as far as I can tell I mean maybe
maybe the girl he's dating you know gave
him this um what else does he have
that's not like ghetto I mean that's a
cool machine like a few years ago
but uh okay yeah he loves this keyboard
this is a mechanical keyboard it's a
duckie he put like you know custom key
caps on it okay he's kind of a geek you
know that's that's sort of par for the
course when it comes to working in this
business I think that's pretty much it
as far as slicks liquid-cooled mission
liquid flow see I kept the habits here
oil cooled machine so I hope you guys
enjoyed me sharing this with you
and don't forget to subscribe to - tech
tips from Oh unboxings reviews and other
computer videos although I cannot
promise that I'll be doing ones like
this very often and for those of you who
are inevitably going to post to an oil
cooled machine build guide no not gonna
happen it's way too much work and the
hardware is pretty much fubar by the end
of it because he said to dry something
to drip dry one of these components out
is going to take a matter of weeks we're
not talking days we're not talking like
you know dust it off we're talking like
by the time you can actually use this in
an air-cooled environment and not have
it just be disgusting and get oil all
over everything we're talking week so
anyway cool machines lick you know I
don't think when he upgrades this to
something modern he's probably
stick with the oil country he says no
but it was fun while it lasted and it
was definitely an interesting item on
the resume don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
