brought to you by phantom glass visit
store antim dot glass for the best iron
screen protectors out there as well as
HyperX it seems like every time we run
into gigabyte they're showing off some
new finished lightest gaming notebook
ever thing and this time they're calling
it the x5 so this is a 15.6 inch laptop
that's got up to three SSDs support it's
got a two and a half inch hard drive bay
it supports up to four sodium's so
that's up to 32 gigs of ddr3 memory it's
got an Intel Core i7 processor it's got
a 3k or optionally a 4k display that's
using an EXO panel so we're not talking
TN nonsense here and most impressively
it's got two geforce gtx 960 5 m
graphics cards this is one absolutely
serious machine it's got their same
macro keys on the left of the keyboard
it's got a chiclet keyboard it's got an
aluminum construction that both helps
dissipate heat and keeps it extremely
lightweight and strong and if you've got
the pretty pennies to put together for
it might just be one of the most
powerful compact gaming machines on the
planet and by one of I mean it might
actually be pretty much it at this point
in terms of i/o you've got three USB 3
ports DisplayPort out HDMI out audio
ports you've got a microSD slot and that
to HDMI out it has dual HDMI pretty cool
did I mention by the way that those SSD
slots are MDOT too so not your typical
and SATA now speaking of having
DisplayPort out the x7 pro is not
actually new the one that's sitting
right here but what is new is that via
DisplayPort out or mini DisplayPort this
one is running an Nvidia g-sync panel
that's not something that's officially
supported g-sync on mobile GPUs now I
can't get any kind of confirmation from
anyone in terms of when were or if we're
gonna see this feature actually
implemented but it's definitely cool to
see it running on hardware that is all
ready out there so that's 970m sli in
the x7 pro so you step down to a 15.6
inch then you get 965 and sli that's
those are 4 gig cards not exactly a you
know a looser option that's for sure but
the premium ARS brand isn't the
one that's getting a little bit of
attention from gigabyte in this one out
of everything they're launching under
the gigabyte brand is the one that
interests me most
I love powerful gaming notebooks I love
affordable gaming notebooks and I love
small gaming notebooks and this looks
like it's going to be a pretty healthy
mix of all of them I don't have exact
pricing and I don't actually have exact
specs I just know you know it's about a
core i7 quad core processor its dual
channel ddr3 memory it supports 1n SATA
SSD up to 512 gigs are realistically if
you could find a one terabyte one I
think Samsung has one you could put a
bigger one in it and it also supports up
to a two terabyte hard drive so it's got
room for an SSD and a hard drive in this
tiny form factor and the most impressive
thing about it other than how slim it is
is that it has a geforce gtx 970m inside
powering the 1080p non TN panel up here
so if you're looking for I don't know
like who exactly this is targeted at
because going along with the 2 USB 3
ports HDMI SD card reader and power and
on this side they've got another two USB
3 ports an audio jack Ethernet which is
nice and VGA so it almost kind of looks
like a business model but then it's got
a 970m in it so if you're like the
traveling you know business person who
also likes to game on the road then this
looks like it might make a fair bit of
sense
speaking of gaming on the road mobile
games and your phone which you should
probably have a phantom glass screen
protector on if you want to have a
gorilla glass screen protector that
keeps you screen safe and also
completely clear and scratch resistant
and easy to apply with no bubbles and
available for a wide variety of
different phones and can't even be taken
off and put back on
just visit store dot phantom dog glass
we've got that linked in the video
description to learn more about this
awesome screen protector that we are
using here at the show and actually I've
been using for quite some time I
shouldn't pretend it's new because I'm
at CES or anything like that but what is
new because I'm at CES is us telling you
about hyper X's YouTube channels so it's
youtube.com slash hyper X they're also
linked in the video description they got
a lot of great gaming content there and
a huge thank you to both phantom glass
