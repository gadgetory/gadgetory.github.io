at pretty much the baller s - GTX 680
out there at this point in time this is
the MSI lightning edition featuring
unlocked digital power and yes three
year warranty as well but yes lightning
edition cards
have triple over voltage which means
that unlike regular Kepler video cards
that is to say everyone's Kepler video
cards except MSI power Edition cards
lightning edition cards or any cards
that feature their triple over voltage
technology weight so the other ones
cannot overload the GPU cannot so your
overclocking will always be limited MSI
has unlocked that capability allowing
you to like break World Records and more
importantly than breaking World Records
just actually get all the performance
that you can get out of your video cards
so you this one's got home yeah GPU
reactor as well which is more for
subzero overclocking but I'll show you
guys that after unlocked BIOS to remove
all protections including active phase
switching over current protection and
thermal design power restrictions BAM
remove it all enhance power design
giving you two times the power output 12
phase PWM design independent memory
power and lightning power layer whatever
that means but it's probably an
additional layer to the PCB or something
for cleaner signaling digital PWM
controller for more precise voltage
control etc etc most of the other cards
don't even need this stuff because you
can't overload them anyway 3x3 OSC kits
so with v checkpoints so you can
manually check voltages with a
multimeter triple over voltage and
triple 10th monitor so you can monitor
the GPU memory and the vrm with
afterburner afterburner by the way is my
favorite video card overclocking
software BarNone is just the best okay
all military class three components you
got your copper moss iceycat schooled
and solid-state chokes and dark swollen
caps i mean i think that's a bit of a
you know ok ok you don't need you know a
gold layer on your solid-state shows but
looks baller
dust removal technologies included with
the trim twin froze or for cooler it's
about super pipes dual 10 centimeter pwm
fans high density fins which are good
and bad
depends dual form in one heat sinks you
know what let's go ahead and get this
baby open up this is uh this is a card
that I've been very excited to have a
look out here so in terms of accessories
you got whoa a bunch of stuff okay so
you got a couple six pin two eight pin
PCIe power connectors you got your V
checkpoint cables so you can adapt those
out to something that's compatible with
your multimeter got VGA DVI to VGA
adapter but get rid of that long
flexible black SLI bridge the very best
kind as well as a certificate of working
miss quality and stability quick user's
guide drivers that you should throw away
download the latest from the Nvidia
website and the beastly card itself so
let's just put this back together the
thoughts cannot do that yeah yeah don't
worry I'm just gonna do that
for sure okay let's just gesturing to me
mostly obscene gestures but it's okay I
forgive him I get my hard time about
things so he's got to get back in here
every once in a while okay lightning
card oh I thought this one had three
power connectors I in fact I even said
it in another video but don't mind me
this has two PCIe eight pin power
connectors 210 centimeter fans these are
actually deeper fans than I'm used to
seeing on video cards as well they have
a bit more well depth to them they're
also using the propeller blades which
are more efficient blades and they have
these plastic tips at the end that are
supposed to reduce noise increase
efficiency and generally be better it
will spin this way on startup which will
pull some of the air out that's you know
launched into the heatsink out of it
before it turns on which should in
theory keep the heatsink pretty much
dust free as long as you power cycle
your computer every once in a while and
I've seen this work in action with
actually not an MSI card but with one of
their competitors cards that features
this counter-rotating boot up technology
so it'll be a little loud at the start
but you know don't be fazed by that it's
all good
it'll it'll it'll quiet down as soon as
it starts spinning the right way huge
cooling potential check this out
so the radiator fins the aluminum fins
go all the way from here all the way
down to here
all the way to the back of the card that
is an enormous cooler for a single GPU I
mean that amount of surface area could
probably be handling a dual GPU graphics
card at this point super pipes are also
included so that's these thicker heat
pipes here that are carrying the heat
much further away from the GPU core
itself right there there's a GK 104
graphics core that's the Kepler GPU
that's featured in all the high end
graphics card six seventy six eighty s6
90s all that good stuff
you've also got okay this is one of the
most rigid cards I've encountered you
can see it has almost no flex to it no
matter what I do and that's for a couple
of reasons number one they've got a
unison covering the vrm and the memory
components check that out thick metal
all the way here all the way up here
giving it an amazing amount of
structural rigidity all the way here
there's those golden the golden guys
right there golden girls golden years
Wonder Years I don't know where I'm
going with this and it also has a full
backplate so there's a little bit of
ventilation Holness going on here around
the pwm as well as just general
backplate in this so this is GPU reactor
you don't have to keep it on you can
take it off if you want but what it does
is it basically builds more components
into the very back of the GPU than they
would otherwise physically be able to
fit just as a little add-in
daughterboard
so like I said take it off if you want
you can leave it on if you want it's
more useful for subzero and extreme
overclocking and well yeah I'm failing
at it but I'll succeed see all right and
you can actually orient this however you
want as well so I'm going to do it this
way because once it's installed I want
everything to be right side up msi
lightning there's also blue LEDs behind
it that look pretty cool as well be
noted that the improper installation of
GPU reactor card may cause damage to the
graphics card yeah that stands to reason
well PCI Express 3.0 power data
connector to SLI connectors for up to a
4 Way SLI functionality if you had four
of these in one system even I would be
jealous at that point would be 4
be honest supports up to three plus one
display so you got dual DVI hdmi and
displayport out on the back of the card
a little bit of installation coming out
the back but this is by and large an
internal exhaust card and that color
scheme oh my goodness because we
actually recently unboxed the other side
big bang empower motherboard and if this
doesn't get your geek juices flowing I
don't know what can because as far as
air-cooled configs go that is about as
beast looking as a guesser you gotta get
you gotta get this angle for like back
there so you can like see that oh I'm
not asking a lover you arrange it so you
can see like the yellow axe I actually
really like the yellow accents on the
board as well as on the video card
itself now just like that's like
hardware the only way that this could be
more like porn is if I was pulling off
all of the heat sinks because but then
you wouldn't even have like the color
coordination anyway so yeah I mean you
know even if you get one of their
slightly lower end cards featuring a
Twin Frozr cooler with like a blue
accent let's see what that looks like
one way or another I think we can all
agree that going with like an all msi
sort of look and feel here is probably a
good thing they haven't like just so
figured out the whole aesthetics thing
in the last little while here I love it
so I think that pretty much covers it
the important things to remember this
gtx 680 will overclock better than other
gtx 680 s period because you can over
build the GPU this is very important to
remember especially if you're spending a
lot of money on a GPU you want to get
the most performance out of it this is
pretty much the way to go so thank you

look at the msi gtx 680 lightning
