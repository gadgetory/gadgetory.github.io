encore on locking quite some time ago on
my NCI XCOM channel but a soos has
actually recently updated their koron
locker utility to make it even simpler
so korra unlocking is basically taking
processors such as the x3 720 which AMD
has what they've done is they've
actually okay i'm going to drop the
camera here for a minute so that I can
break the seal on the CPU box here what
a nd has actually done is they have
physically disabled well not physically
but through kind of a software trick
they have disabled the one of the cores
in the CPU so they've actually got dual
cores that are also unlock or lock quad
cores as well as the triple course so
the 720 today basically okay yeah I'm
going to sort of stop rambling the point
of this video is to show you in real
time how quickly you can unlock the core
of a CP top the CPU in order to get
better performance out of it so today
I'm going to be using the m4 a89 GTD pro
USB 3 from a seuss using their core on
Locker so a seuss has simplified the
whole process down to one button a
switch that you hit on the motherboard
that will automatically unlock any
available extra cores for you so here's
my my retail 720 just going to install
it in the socket here lift up the lever
alright where's my little triangle I
think it's going to be in that corner
yep there we go
okay so install that now I'm just doing
a quick demo here so I'm not going to
bother all my batteries dying that's
going to make this a far less effective
demonstration in real time hopefully it
lasts long enough for me to get some
thermal compound on here and boot this
thing up so I'm just going to apply a
little bit of thermal compound on the
CPU and then I'm just going to throw a
heatsink on top of it rather than
actually hook it up properly because I
don't have a whole lot of time here so
here we go just going to plug in the fan
okay so the core on Locker has been
simplified right down to a and we're
back hate it when the battery dies on my
camera but what can you do okay so I was
just showing the core
unlocking button that a sous has added
to their motherboard
well motherboards some of them so you
can see there's a little arrow here that
points to where the core on Walker
button is you press that button the
light goes red and then in theory there
are four cores on this triple core CPU
now there's a lot of misconceptions
about you know they're being dangers
involved in unlocking cores like your
system is going to be unstable and that
may be true but you got to understand
that AMD unlocks course for any number
of different reasons some of them are
unlocks them locks them seals them off
for any number of different reasons so
press f1 to go into setup okay f10 enter
and so those reasons could be anything
ranging from the core being actually
physically defective to may be it not
needing their target power envelope to
maybe it being stable but you know only
only within not quite within their
tolerances because almost all CPUs will
actually run faster than what they're
spectat by at least a little bit okay so
as long as you run the proper stability
test there you go for course are
activated that was easy as long as you
run the necessary stability tests on
your CPU which means just you know
prime95 for 24 to 48 hours if the CPU
doesn't make a math error then it's
stable and this one appears to be not a
stable that's too bad I mean there you
go I just pulled sort of any random any
random retail CPU and this one happens
to not be stable with the core on Locker
I'm going to give it sort of one more
try I'm going to load the defaults and
the setup here and I'm gonna because hmm
that's kind of disappointing I've
actually had pretty good success myself
on locking CPUs and I had hoped that
this just sort of random one would work
for me here so far no success but that's
the whole point of doing this kind of
thing on camera so that everyone can
learn
and have new experiences if y'all have
some of my v8 juice hopefully we don't
get a blue screen this time these
screens are bad okay
no let's just start Windows normally huh
I wonder if it's to do with HCI mode it
could be something like that now I guess
you're along for the ride now I'm not
about to stop the video now here
interested you can keep watching and if
you're not then you can always not watch
anymore so I'm going to go into the
onboard devices configuration I'm going
to set the serial serial port No
I'm going to set the on board No hey
where are my one of my SATA ports rough
Bridge configuration no no this is
stupid
hmm
well I might have to give up at some
point here can't figure out how to set
radon this motherboard normally it's
here but I don't see it here so I
actually don't have any any ideas beyond
that
oh and if that's a problem I'm gonna do
this probably not but you never know
maybe I'll just show you the testbench
some more so there's that little light
that says in theory everything should be
working I didn't turn on turbo key so
it's not the it's not the automated
overclocking that's causing any problems
here and we'll try to have one more time
Oh would it be funny if that have been
it how about that so there you go we
figured out how to get the system booted
up well we I guess I well you were here
too okay no we we figured out how to get
the system booted up I have catalyst
control center installed which is
completely unnecessary when you're
running a Nvidia video cards so I'm just
going to go ahead and exit that so let's
uh let's fire up CPU Z to see whether we
have four cores running or not so I'm
just going to go ahead and do that and
it looks like we have four cores four
threads they're running at stock speed
of 2.8 gigahertz so we'll go into the
task manager here so yeah you can see
that task manager has one two three four
CPUs and then we okay this is what I was
saying before you will need to run
prime95 and I recommend small FFTs four
I'd say a minimum of 24 hours and then
I'd run it anywhere from 24 to 48 hours
to ensure that your triple core CPU is
stable with 4 cores enabled and then you
can actually even sometimes overclock
triple cores unlock to quad-core and get
even even more performance out of them
but there you go that was my core
unlocking tutorial and we figured out
what the problem was and thank you for
checking it out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
