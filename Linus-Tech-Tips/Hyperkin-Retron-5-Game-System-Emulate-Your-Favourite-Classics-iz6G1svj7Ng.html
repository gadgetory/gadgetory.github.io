tired of triple-a developers releasing
broken or subpar games over and over
again often with DLC that officially or
not fixes the experience this phenomenon
has pushed myself and a number of my
friends back to the retro gaming crowd
but managing a collection of old
consoles and managing the space required
for old-school TVs can be frustrating
enter the retron 5 from hyper Ken also I
will be hopefully reviewing the Mickey
Mickey or the Kano fairly soon so stay
tuned for that
from December 13th to 20th 2014 you can
save on select Intel CPUs knucks and
SSDs with special holiday rebates from
select retailers click now to learn more
first off we have the actual physical
unit on the front were greeted by Game
Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance
slot and the power button which takes a
kind of surprisingly long time to engage
but does feel quite solid and has a
satisfying click to it on each side we
have a controller port for NES SNES and
Genesis which totals to 6 controller
ports in all for a two-player gaming
experience on any one of the consoles on
the back we have an HDMI port USB mini
for the included controller an AC power
jack and an SD card slot which you can
use for things like updating the system
cheat codes and screenshots along with
savestate files
speaking of the included controller it's
garbage and I don't recommend using for
absolutely anything the quality control
seems to be more than a little rough to
seemingly identical buttons in the top
corners of the controller
feel completely different one has a nice
tactile audible feedback and the other
one feels mushy and dampened the
shoulder buttons are similar again the
left side shoulder button has a
satisfying tactile inaudible feedback
while the right one is mushy and
sometimes leaves you wondering if you
even press the button at all the best
word I could use for the other buttons
on the controller is acceptable but then
it comes to the 8 way thumb stick we
is straight-up puke worthy it squeaks
when you spin it which will happen while
playing from time to time and while most
of the lower directions work fine I
guess there's some sort of obstruction
in the top which grinds against the
stick creating an unpleasant noise and a
horrible feeling
I wish hyper can what have ditched this
abysmal excuse for a controller and just
lowered the price unfortunately they
didn't so we're stuck paying full price
and dish in the controller ourselves but
wait Luke it has a redeeming feature
Wireless really wireless you wanted to
add more latency to this setup
we're playing retro games with a
wireless controller there's more latency
between your controller input and your
character's movement and it's noticeable
in this case this will stack on top of
the input leg on most modern TVs
compared to old CRTs and you're going to
have a bad time
speaking of latency it's a shame that
the only output option is HDMI so this
pretty much precludes the use of a CRT
TV
so forget about light guns and super
scopes if you don't need those you can
have a TV with game mode which turns off
the image processing or a low latency PC
monitor and that would help a lot in
fact having it next to your PC monitor
seems like a really cool use case for
the retron 5 if you're concerned about
the legality of PC emulators and we'll
talk about that more later on simply
plug the retron 5 into an alternate
input on one of your monitors and switch
your input to it whenever you'd like to
play and with that we'll jump back to
the top of the unit in the back there's
a slot to hold the controller but we
just use it to hold games and just the
head of that we have the glossy finish
something I wish manufacturers would
stop using for fairly obvious reasons
slotted into that glossy finish is your
ports for Genesis SNES NES and Famicom
cartridges other reviews are complaining
that on this retron 5 the slots are too
tight to actually remove the game from
and sure the first time you use it it
might be a little bit tight but even
after all
moderate amount of use it becomes quite
easy to just swap games in and out in
front of these slots we have the logo
for the retron 5 and an LED indicator
system letting you know which game is
inserted the LED would have been much
nicer if it was possible to have more
than one game inserted at a time anyways
if you insert more than one game instead
of just choosing which one you want to
play you are served an error message
until you remove all the game cartridges
that you don't want to use when you boot
up the retron 5 you're greeted by a
simple yet surprisingly or not Android
based gaming system within the settings
menu or you will be able to find various
video and audio settings included but
not limited to image filters scan lines
and sound enhancement which actually
sounds pretty good you also have options
like controller remapping win to load
save States and where to save things for
those that wish to use maybe an SD card
there are loads of options and overall
this menu system is a good experience
even with its overall kind of cheesy
menu sounds and a little bit tedious
software and firmware updating process
which really isn't that bad if you watch
their video on how to do it you can even
access quick menu within the game for
stuff like save States and other various
quick menu options simply by pressing
down and start at the same time now
loading games can be a little funky with
no official compatibility list as far as
I know it's a bit of a gamble plugging a
game in it will probably work and you'll
mainly just find issues with multi game
cartridges or multi cartridge setups but
there will be the odd game that should
probably work but totally doesn't
another frustrating issue with this is
that sometimes a ROM may load and it may
be able to run the game making it
playable but it won't actually recognize
the game meaning that it won't load any
of your save States and of the cheats
will actually function properly one
really cool thing the retron lets you do
however is to utilize old carts that
have dead batteries much more
effectively than you could have
otherwise if the battery is dead in your
cartridge and you don't go through the
process of replacing it you won't
actually be able to save anything
properly but if you use savestates on
the red
you can essentially replace this
functionality which is great as it can
breathe life back into some old beloved
games those are problems I can look past
however as honestly the vast majority of
games will work just fine you just have
to be careful about keeping things like
the contacts on your cards clean enough
for the console bill to read it as well
as possible every time to get a good
load and a good detection whenever you
insert it what does get on my nerves
however is moving the save data from the
game to the retron and from the retron
to the game it feels like moving the
save data to the retron works
essentially every time but I can't
really be all that sure that moving the
save data from the retron back to the
Kart actually ever worked it didn't
actually ever work it seems like it
would be able to sometimes work but it
would wipe part of the data that was on
there and then not load the new data
which is essentially destroying your
save file I had that happen to my
Pokemon blue cart rest in peace
Pokemon blue save game rest in peace
early on I mentioned that this is a cool
way to play your old games through
emulation in order to utilize things
like save States while doing it more
legally than emulating roms on something
like a PC or a phone and while being
able to use your badass original cards
at the save time unfortunately it seems
that high Perkin may be using other
developers code for a lot of their
emulator support without asking or
contacting those people at all all of
this is under a code license of gplv3
which forbids incorporating the software
into something like for example a
locked-down piece of hardware which is
then sold so ah there's a bunch of legal
mumbo-jumbo going on which i don't fully
understand on the situation is kind of a
mess so if you want to learn more I
suggest you just google retro art versus
retro on or retro art versus hyper canon
you'll find more information there in
conclusion is this the end-all
replacement to old-school console
clutter no latency issues that you will
most likely have to deal with at some
degree do
the inclusion of HDMI will be
frustrating and it has its quirks with
features like moving saves on and off
the retron totally not working and in
some cases even breaking what is already
there and it comes with a controller
which will just add mass to landfills
but in a lot of cases the actual unit
can get the job done I personally think
it would be pretty neat accessory for
someone's PC setup when configured as an
alternate input to their monitor but at
its current price of 160 dollars I see
most people looking the other way let me
