Arctic hobby land rider 507 this is an
excavator it is ready to run it has all
kinds of different cool features but the
first feature we're going to show you is
how the Box opens because that is what
we do on this channel so I've been asked
a number of times why am i unboxing fire
trucks and tanks and excavators and the
answer is because Arctic hobby is
related to Arctic cooling which is a
company that focuses on PC hardware and
has a partnership with NCIX where I work
and NCIX sells these and I think they're
Baus as well so that those are all the
reasons I think that should be fairly
self-explanatory at this point I can't
figure out how to get that controller oh
well we'll figure it out after okay here
we go so we've got included batteries
both 9-volt and battery pack we've got a
charged battery pack ready to go already
down on the floor over there so you can
get um there's an Arctic charging
station and you can use that to charge
the batteries and comes with the cable
for that which is somewhere and then you
can also get the the other charger so
that's the one that we have which is
just a wall wart and that plugs into the
wall
okay we've also got an antenna for the
remote so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna go ahead not do anything because
it's stuck and then finally we have one
of those little straws for the antenna
that goes on to the excavator itself to
hold it up so that we get better
reception so this is all pretty much
your standard fare not a bad idea for a
Christmas gift if there's a you know
someone you know who you don't like very
much and their kids around the age that
they would enjoy a fire engine or a tank
or an excavator and you want to you want
to give their parents something really
noisy and obnoxious here's all the
different ways that the are
is able to be actuated it's not actually
sure if I use that word correctly let's
have a bully chair very late I'm very
tired I would like to go home but here I
am in the tech tips room you know how it
is
okay so let's pull this guy out and see
what we've got here I mean we've got an
excavator I know that much but let's see
exactly what we've got here how does
this ah there this comes out this one
has secured quite differently from the
other two so that was what I needed to
do to get it out hopefully I'm not
breaking it too badly here there we go
we have our excavator so why don't I let
Slick who thinks it's hilarious when I
break things apparently why don't I let
Slick go ahead and take a closer look at
the land Rider here while I go ahead and
start getting start getting it set up
and pick the controller out all that
kind of good stuff let's get this off
so this is our antenna so in order to
get this bad boy set up we're gonna have
to go ahead and huh there we go run this
through the little straw thingamajiggy
you don't have to look closely what I'm
doing over here that's fine just show
them the straw when it's done so you
feed that through there this thing
actually looks pretty good actually all
of these I'm surprised given the price
point and given the lack of context that
I have for toys that are available to
kids these days and all that I mean you
could not buy something like this for a
hundred bucks when I was a kid so or
like you could probably get something
like this but it certainly wouldn't be
remote-control like it would look kind
of like this I mean one thing that the
that the toys that sort of we had were
were better for was the overall
construction quality like they tended to
be made of of metal rather than being
made of plastic although in terms of
durability I'd say all these land Rider
device
those are not bad at all because they're
fairly solidly built although what I
haven't tried is you know doing
extensive crash testing with them or
anything like that so it's hard to say
how they're going to hold out in the
long term I have no idea how you are
expected to remove this oh it's another
removable piece look at that okay there
we go yeah there we go so I got to
remove that screw which means I'm gonna
have to go off-camera give me a second
I'm gonna get this all assembled here
and we are gonna test out this land
Rider
507 like crazy tech tip style okay guys
so I'm just gonna take a closer look cuz
I haven't even checked out the land
Rider 507 much myself yet so we've got
rubber treads this is something we've
come to expect from arctic hobby
products we've also got some pretty cool
compensation going on here you see that
flex there so it should be able to go
over things fairly easily uh what else
we got here we've got little sort of
rubber hosing things running around
we've got sort of realistic-looking
hydraulics with shiny chrome silver
pieces ah
let's comes off and then goes back on
cool okay look at that look at that
driver's seat it's too bad that oh wait
hold on yeah it's too bad the door
doesn't open otherwise you could totally
put like a little action figure dude in
there I'd be kind of neat like a little
Lego guy or something okay we've got
like a light here I wonder if that light
actually turns on I wouldn't do that
surprised at this point because so much
of their stuff is uh like has lights and
sirens and whatnot so here's the bucket
so you can see here check this out so
that's how the hydraulics look when they
work pretty good pretty good
alright let's uh let's go ahead and get
started I'll show you guys the control
up close first okay so we've got your
left red front and back
you're right tread forward and backwards
and then the bucket goes left and right
up and down and up and down in the
various different places so let's try
this up first thing we're going to do is
lift the lift the bucket up
Hey look how fast that goes whoo
there we go okay let's try the other one
alright ok let's try moving this bad boy
forward a little bit ok and then let's
go down ok huh I wonder what kind of
weight it can handle ok not much was the
answer ok so you can swing it around
and swinging around the other right hole
Oh check this out though guys alright
yeah I was right so when you're doing
something this light does turn on oops
sorry
there you go so you can see what you're
doing in the dark now what kind of speed
can we expect out of the land rider 507
here let's let's uh move it around on
the tech tips floor here
there's that off-roading I'm talking
about there before we can spin in place
black the Texas white board again BAM
and then they'll like here we come
slowly so I don't think it's as fast as
the firecracker the tank but it's got
some you know it's got some go to it
not a bad gift for kids or childlike
adults although you can confuse someone
by buying this further and putting it
this way before you give it to them
oh no look at this okay so oh that's a
little bit disappointing so you got to
bring it all the way back around in
order to turn it the other way because I
was going to say you can put it right
back words and then people be all like
oh yeah I think I'm going to go forward
and then the thing would actually go
backwards
let's see now you can see it does go to
the correct direction
this guy
okay I think for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
