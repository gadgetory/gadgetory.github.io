up and sort of died so you Duke died so
that's sort of not true to the Duke
storyline nah I'm just kidding you
didn't get penalized for that excellent
video loved it and then Primus bum bum
great YouTube name by the way but he did
an animation where Duke rescues Linus
and then like ejects him from where he
rescued him from in a balloon and he's
still in the cage so I'm not sure what
he's doing but I thought it was pretty
amusing and just great great drawings

what NCIX goes through to get your
package to you that one was awesome
great job on that one then I know we
spent a lot of time on it so you guys
