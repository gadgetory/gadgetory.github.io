have a couple of firsts won't be the
first time that I've just like read off
of a product review guide because I
don't know anything about the product
but it will be the first time that I'll
have a juiced-up Edition phone it will
be the first time that I'll be showing
off a fingerprint sensor under the
screen of a commercial product and it
will be the first time that we have shot
an entire video on a stabilized gimbal
setup move around move around it's like
he's walking man walk more Brandon you
got this and this video is brought to
you by PI a private Internet access

through the link in the video
description
so vivo is a phone brand that we've
never really checked out before in the
past but there are a couple of things
about this guy that are actually pretty
interesting so first of all this is the
first phone that I've yet to get my
hands on that has Qualcomm's new
Snapdragon 660 a ie processor in it so
it's AI and like experience and it
wasn't you all right so let's fire this
up it's running the fun touch OS which I
think has to be the best name for an
Android skin yet and the first thing
that you're gonna notice about this
thing is that screen to bezel ratio they
have actually cracked the 90% barrier
thanks to their use of a not which you
can feel however you do or don't feel
about it it's a thing it's not going
away and thanks to their use of an under
screen fingerprint sensor which also
lets you not have the fingerprint sensor
on the back which some people like but
I'm not personally a fan of it's
actually kind of amazing how few
features you have to give up with like
these more value oriented phones now
like it doesn't have wireless charging
or anything but at least has NFC I could
find the antenna nor does it not connect
it to the usb port nope apparently still
a thing no NFC so this is it this is the
big moment
add fingerprint 4 digit password oh wow
they've got security questions what was
the name of your primary school but
central battery
whenever the fingerprint sensor is
active and it's under the screen right
here you can't see it pretty much at all
you're gonna have this this blue and
greenie kind of light up better
recognition with a slightly deeper press
okay well didn't get me that time okay
so it's pretty slow compared to some of
the more modern not under a screen
fingerprint sensors that we've become
used to it's especially noticeable when
you compare this to shoot what phone was
that recently that I checked out where
you could just swipe your finger down
the sensor right bs9 and it would
register the whole thing it was there's
a pretty tedious Wow this thing is
actually not that cheap so rumored
pricing is around thirty six thousand
Indian rupees which would make it about
five hundred and forty US dollars so
it's not up there with like flagship
phone pricing but it's actually not that
inexpensive so here this is our first
chance to take a look at this
functionality in action you see that the
OLED screen lights up bright that gives
the sensor under the display enough
illumination to read the identifying
ridges on your finger oh that's nice so
it's got an OLED display so that means
that it can have just the fingerprint
pixels active so you can actually wake
the whole thing without pressing that's
not bad
you know what here why don't we just do
like a fingerprint sensor speed test let
me grab a couple of other devices and
here what do you want to start with do
you want to start with like the other
like Chinese brands or should I start
with like something cut more flagship
you like the s9 Chinese friend okay so
here it is next to the me mix to s well
how do i okay you guys are gonna have to
take my word for it I'm pressing it at
the same time one two three go
not bad it's not far off
all right pixel to excel faster but not
world's faster like we're not talking i
phone six here uh is this embargoed I
actually don't know meet 10 Pro Galaxy S
9i phone 10 my face ID is broken so no
fingerprint sensor why did they take it
off right because they didn't have
apparently the technology that vivo has
I should do a video where I try and get
Apple to fix it get started
face ID is not available trying it later
doesn't work by the way
so like any modern phone one of the big
features is the camera so I'm just going
to be testing the stabilization while I
walk down the stairs and I'm also giving
you guys a look at the stabilized rig
that Brandon's using to shoot this I
don't know if I'm at the bottom yet
how close am I okay I'm at the bottom
gopis so I've got an iPhone 10 compared
to the vivo X 21 here hi Taryn I'm
lacking stability with this door oh the
iPhone 10 handles that backlight a lot
better in spite of the AI camera
features it's not helpful but thank you
anyway so I actually really like taking
test pictures here because you've got
this these really bright colors you've
got this nice blue sky and then you've
got these hard shadows and that's
something that even with HDR is quite
difficult for smartphone cameras to
handle so now I want to see how it
handles lower light I mean that really
is the main difference for cell phone
cameras these days is how they handle
processing the image as opposed to
the sensors really getting a lot better
generation by generation just crashed ha
I never thought I was going to capture
that on camera since after I've done my
review I have had a few just random hard
resets like that and I asked Samsung
about it and they were like no no I know
I know you're talking about so this
thing's got all kinds of tech that you
might not expect on sort of a mainstream
performance phone and it uses micro USB
what year is it does it have wireless
charging I guess I could consult my
doodad here so the glass back is for
looks and for feel and it actually does
look and feel pretty good was not to
enable wireless charging anyway and that
in screen unlocked that is so cool I
gotta give them credit the specs to
price ratio pretty impressive if that's
correct because it's got a hundred and
twenty eight gigs of storage so you can
take a lot of those photos and six gigs
of ram so overall impressions here are
decent like obviously it captured the
image but it lost a lot of detail in the
darkest parts of the scene here that was
retained by all of the other cameras
even if Jamie didn't do a great job of
their color science here until these
greens are like neon bushes and then as
for low light the pixel 2xl and the s9
plus were the ones that got the color
closest and then the iPhone 10 the me
makes 2s and the vivo x21 all kind of
bland all yellow and have a lot of
processing and all these artifacts
yeah the X 21 was the worst in the
low-light scenario and the construction
doesn't really stand out either it's
well balanced in the hand I've got to
give them credit for that and this
curved glass back actually both looks
and feels better in person than the
camera is probably capturing but I do
have to say the way that they've joined
the front panel assembly here to the
kasing is pretty last-gen you can see a
very noticeable ridge between them with
all of that said though the screen looks
fantastic it really does feel like a
giant display floating in your hand the
cost is very reasonable they ship it
with an included screen protector and lo
and behold they weren't able to make it
waterproof obviously that's not anywhere
in the rating but it's got a headphone
jack so for the price I'm actually like
in this thing a lot even though this was
far from an in-depth review I've yet to
see where they're going with the whole
AI processor aspect of it it's supposed
to optimize both battery life in terms
of giving less resources to stuff that
you don't care about and more to stuff
that you do as well as helping with the
camera but that's something that's going
to take time to continue to develop on
the subject of audio quality that I
might expect the speakers on this do
leave a lot to be desired
they get loud so that's not bad but I've
actually come to expect now a powered
secondary speaker up here so you get a
little bit of stereo effect at the very
least man that screen looks good though
I love ultra wide displays which is why
it's all the more mystery why this isn't
stretching to the edges you have to find
something else for that and this display
looks good for like a value phone though
not crazy even got p3 color space
support on the subject of things that
are a great value ting ting is the
mobile carrier that's focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction and with ting you don't
have to pay for more than the airtime
that you use all you got to do is go to
Linus ting comm we're gonna have that
linked in the video description you
enter your last few bills and how much
you paid for them and it will spit out
how much money you would save on ting
the average ting bill is just 23 bucks a
month per device
ting has a program where if you're stuck
in a contract and you want to switch to
them they'll pay 25% of your
cancellation fee up to 75 bucks and just
by using our link you can get 25 bucks
towards your service or towards a new

get subscribed maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description
also down there is our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join you know as far as Android skins go
this is far from the worst that I've
seen I actually really like the pull-up
tray that they got going on here it's
kind of iOS II other than the iPhone
