device for review I declared it to be
too big for humans and handed it off
like a pair of dirty gym socks to the
nearest Linus Media Group employee in
this case it ended up being Luke to do
the video for me and yet here we are a
mere two years later and not only have I
been using the note 5 as my daily driver
for a couple of weeks I might have even
enjoyed it
the mastercase 5 by coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so let's start
with a physical tour of the Galaxy Note
5 at the back is a camera the flash and
sexy leather finished vinyl skin
courtesy of dbrand who provided our
phone on the sides are the almost
perfect lock button on the right and
volume rockers on the left they've got
great tactile feedback and are easy to
feel for when you're not looking but I
wish the lock button was just a touch
lower so that I wouldn't accidentally
mash the volume down while pressing it
on the bottom is the headphone jack the
hopefully not long for this world
microbead charging port the retractable
s-pen housing and a speaker that makes
up for its poor positioning by being
surprisingly loud without Distortion
a definite calling card of the note
series and then finally at the front is
the stunner of a 5.7 inch 1440p AMOLED
display with shockingly thin bezels a
5-megapixel selfie camera a satisfyingly
tactile physical home button and a
couple of difficult to avoid in
landscape capacitive buttons for back
navigation and multitasking something
that I found myself wishing I could turn
off in favor of on-screen buttons like
with the oneplus 2 during the frequent
times that I was watching videos on this
device thanks to how gorgeous the screen
is and yet the physical tour somehow
doesn't tell the whole story of the note
5 somehow and I don't know how they did
it but I'm not the only one who noticed
the note 5 is big but it doesn't feel as
ungainly and difficult to hold as other
phablet class devices that I've played
with in the past like the one Mac's
iPhone six-plus and previous notes and
there's more that's different about it
as well while Samsung used to use the
bulky size of the note series to cram
every feature under the Sun and their
fastest Hardware into what we argued at
the time wasn't even really a phone
anymore they've back pedaled on that a
fair bit this time
I mean sure almost everything the s6 can
do the note 5 can do better
it lacks a 128 gig model but it's got
the same Exynos 7420 octa-core CPU and
GPU a hefty bump up from three gigs to
four gigs of low-power ddr4 Ram surely
to assist with those uh TouchWiz multi
window and split screen features that
only really makes sense on a large
screen device like this the accordion
Gorilla Glass 4 topped display I know I
already said this but it merits another
mention is absolutely fantastic with
pitch blacks vibrant whites and thanks
to its a barely existent bezels a kind
of like window into another place look
to it and it's got all the usual tech
specs NFC looking at u1 plus AC wireless
quick charging both on a wire and
wirelessly on the note and a fingerprint
sensor on the home button whose speed
and accuracy I didn't properly
appreciate until I spent a couple of
weeks with the ZTE axon along with of
course an absolutely kick-ass 16
megapixels still 4k video rear camera
whose lightning-fast launch times great
low-light performance and generally
amazing usability have contributed to a
lot of captured moments of my kids that
wouldn't have happened before I upgraded
my wife to the s6 active which features
the same camera but is that good enough
well I guess there's also the s-pen now
you click it and it Turtles out kind of
like Luke's lightsaber and that scene on
Jabba's Sail Barge then you unsheath it
so you can unleash your ideas goals and
dreams or some like that actually
it's nothing to do with dreams it's just
a stylus a pretty good and thankfully
battery free passive stylus but still
just a stylus it's low latency but not
latency free it's not particularly
ergonomic and while the palm rejection
really is very excellent and the
software does offer some handy features
being able to press the button on the
stylus to load up useful cloud syncing
apps like OneNote or quickly scribble on
a screen capture stood out to me I just
didn't find myself using it much to jot
down quick notes about like eggs I need
to buy or whatever I mean maybe if I
didn't type as quickly as I do on a
touchscreen or if I needed to add little
doodles in any of the seemingly infinite
number of ink colors thicknesses and pen
tips each with their own distinctive
simulated writing sound it might make
more sense for me but personally the
benefit of quickly launching a
note-taking app is quickly outweighed by
the relative slowness
of writing with a pen compared to typing
but if you're like me and you don't care
about the stylus never fear just put it
into the phone backwards and you'll
never be able to get it out again or you
could just ignore it whatever is better
for you now we're almost at the
conclusion but I do have a couple of
more notes TouchWiz adds a triple tap on
the home button to get a smaller version
that's easier to reach with one hand
that's a winner for me the smart lock
with trusted Bluetooth devices still
sucks so much ass that it'll turn your
teeth Brown I was using fingerprint
authentication and when I'm in range of
a trusted device sometimes and I can't
quite find the pattern I actually have
to press on lock slide the screen and
finally I still have to use my
fingerprint to unlock the freaking thing
this is something that works just fine
on other phones there's more good news
though the battery life is surprisingly
good considering the anemic 3000
milliamp hour battery and yeah I don't
know
yes okay we can get on with the
conclusion it's like it's kind of an S
series but bigger and ever so slightly
better with a pen and maybe that's my
issue here since when is the note series
supposed to be the S series with a
couple of my mute improvements and a
bigger screen in the past it really had
its own identity as a as a power user
phone or productivity phone and while
the stylus or s-pen remains gone is the
removable battery that allowed creative
users to stuff multi-day battery packs
under modified rear housings gone is the
expandable storage that allowed this
user to equip his Note 2 with 288 gigs
of storage back in 2013 and what do we
get in return exactly Samsung well for
me personally I guess I got a device
that is ergonomically usable as opposed
to one that feels completely derp tastic
it's astounding how much of a difference
a couple fractions of a millimeter make
although I think Apple is taking it one
step too far with their modified
three-and-a-half millimeter Jack patents
but I just don't know if that's going to
appease the power users who have been
using phablet since before it was cool
in typical Samsung fashion they built an
entire product category off of these
folks and now that it's gone mainstream
they've just left them hanging I mean
they're still going to sell a metric
wack ton of these anyway since and I
understand this for most people a device
that requires a plastic doodad like a
fly grip just to hold it has zero appeal
but this is still in my mind the kind of
short-term thinking that is exactly what
keeps Samsung focused on selling widgets
to their customers rather than building
relationships with their customers
through long-term support and
understanding and meeting their needs
the way that someone like Apple does a
point that was driven home by Apple's
recent announcement that the iPad 2 a
device from 2011 can now be updated to
iOS 9 the same cannot be said about my
Galaxy Tab 10.1 that I purchased a full
year later and has
barely any updates at all okay so
putting all that aside when viewed in a
vacuum is the note 5 a success yeah it
is it's a beautiful masterpiece of a
device but I just had to get that last
bit out of my system four previous note
users and anyone else who has an old
Samsung device still running some
antiquated version of Android and
doesn't feel like Samsung puts enough
effort into the long term support of
these gadgets that we drop what in the
case of this one is an awful lot of
money on speaking of spending an awful
lot of money on your gadgets why not
