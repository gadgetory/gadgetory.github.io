tech tips show I've just booted up the
msi 870 a fusion that's the Lucid hydro
board with the AMD here it is x4 970 and
I want to find out if it will unlock to
six cars so I see most settings wrong
press f1 to run setup this is very
normal for the first time you boot up a
board and let's go and try and figure
out how to do this okay unlock CPU core
enabled
of course I'm not gonna do any actual
overclocking or anything CPU core
control okay that's on auto is fine
so it's find out what happened back in a
moment the suspense is killing me here
and that the desktop but my mouse driver
isn't recognized yet I tried unplugging
it and plugging it back into a different
port and it didn't work sometimes that
works come on driver I don't want to
reboot because it's not really worth the
hassle you can see the resolutions wrong
on the desktop because I rebooted with a
completely different hardware setup so
I'll take this time to address once once
again why it always says this copy of
Windows is not genuine it's because when
I change Hardware it'll want me to
reactivate which takes about 6 minutes
online and there's no way I'm gonna
spend that amount of time every time I
need to test something because that's
really dumb so that's why I do what I do
okay it says cores 4 threads 4 and that
is verified by test manager so let's see
if maybe I did something wrong and I'll
be back in a moment
okay well digging a little bit further
into the cell menu reveals a couple of
things first of all that this CPU is not
unlockable not in the sense that you can
try to unlock it and then it'll either
work or it won't but this particular
chip is not unlockable at all so even
when you enable all cores and if you go
and set the core control to manual you
can see there are
only a potential for course to enable or
disable so you don't have the OP there
aren't there aren't latent course just
sitting on this this isn't a harvested
six core CPU for a lower-end part now
I've heard stories that some of the nine
70s will be but it looks like this one
is not so it is a four core it is
unlocked you are getting everything ads
advertised but it looks like there's no
six core unlocking special sauce to be
had at least on my 970 we may see more
people trying this over the coming weeks
and please feel free to comment under
this video and let me know if others do
have success but there you have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
