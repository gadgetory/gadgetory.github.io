this was my first camera and when I
bought it
Canon had a stranglehold on the small
form-factor video market thanks to the
5d mark ii s amazing success two years
prior in 2008 the mark 3 in 2012 was a
solid incremental upgrade but since its
release the marketplace has changed a
lot and Canada's dominance has
absolutely been challenged
so can the mark 4 hold its own against
the stiff competition that has sprung up
from Panasonic Sony and even Fujifilm
let's find out mass drop is hosting a
drop for the high five and 8350
headphones which you can get for $99.99
US dollars check it out at the link in
the video description let's take a quick
physical tour of the camera on the right
we have two memory slots one SD and one
compact flash on the top we find the hot
shoe settings display and controls for
focus and exposure as well as the mode
dial here on the left of the camera we
have a flash connector mic in a
headphone jack
mini HDMI out unfortunately this is a
worthless connector and USB the rear of
the camera has a shiny 3.2 inch
touchscreen quick access buttons a
joystick a mode dial and a larger menu
selection and settings dial so then out
of the box the mark 4 will feel very
familiar to anyone who has used a mid
tier or better Canon DSLR but with some
welcome additions the first usability
change that really stood out to me was
canons new integrated touch interface
whatever Apple might say a smartphone is
not a replacement for a DSLR but that
doesn't mean we can't learn from them
using the touch screen like I would on
my phone to set focus points to wherever
I wanted in the frame quickly is awesome
and became second nature in both video
mode and live view for Stills and on
that subject live view which I have
always avoided for stills on Canon
cameras due to its sluggishness and
inaccuracy was surprisingly usable I
shot portraits of a friend's newborn and
in order to get some of the top down
shots that I wanted I had to hold the
camera in front of me in such a way that
I could only see
cameras display enough for composition
trusting that focus will be taken care
of by the cameras dual pixel AF and to
my surprise all of these photos came out
sharp even with my unintentional changes
in distance between each shot
so beyond being a convenient way to
choose your focus point the face
detection AF allows you to use your
camera at awkward angles where it's very
uncomfortable or even impossible to look
through the viewfinder with a stronger
confidence that the camera will nail
focus for the shot
moving on to video mode instead of being
only fixated on image quality in this
review I wanted to push the camera it's
AF in particular to see if I could find
success in situations that would
normally be very difficult as a solo
operator so I put the mark for my glide
cam and did a tracking shot on a 35
millimeter lens at F 1.8 and oh my god
this is awesome the mark 4 managed to
keep Luke in focus
even as he was running away in this shot
now I know this isn't a new technology
from Canon but this is the first time
face detection AF was put into a 5d and
it has never been better it isn't
perfect and while shooting with the mark
4 I did find scenarios that made it
stumble but what impressed me even then
is how natural looked when recovering
from its tumbles it managed to look much
more human than any autofocus I've seen
in any other camera this is the kind of
feature that can legitimately make you
look like a better camera operator and
even compensate for not having a focus
polar in certain situations on top of
the performance benefits of the
touchscreen paired with the AF the menus
in the 5d are a breeze to navigate no
more needless scrolling through the same
five menus only to click through the
wrong one and accidentally click out and
start all over again these two are the
kinds of little things that can speed up
your workflow while shooting leading to
ultimately better results let's move on
to Canon sensor for the 5d this time
around we're looking at a thirty point
four megapixel CMOS sensor with an ISO
range of 100 to 30 mm on paper it's a
very nice bump up in stills resolution
from the mark 3 though we'll get more
into that later with a slew of new video
recording modes including DCI 4k up to
30 fps
shooting video on the 5d brought me back
to the beginning of my career canna
hasn't lost the relative simplicity in
the menus compared to my current daily
driver the sony a7s - and they've even
managed to add quick functions that
don't take over your entire live you
like on previous cameras so you can
finally change settings like white
balance resolution frame rate and audio
levels all without leaving the live view
of the camera
thumbs up Canon which leads us to a
callin thumbs down that many it brought
up when looking over the initial specs
of the mark 4 when shooting 4k video the
mark 4 has a 1.6 for crop of its
full-frame sensor making its effective
size roughly similar to an aps-c sensor
like my Canon 60d but while I understand
the disappointment I also understand
that there were probably engineering
challenges associated with shooting
full-frame 4k and anyway I don't agree
that this is should be the top criticism
of this camera because while I shoot
with a full-frame 35 millimeter field of
view on the a7s2 I actually prefer the
look of a 1.6 crop for a lot of my
projects so when shooting with the mark
4 I actually was quite pleased with the
extra reach I got from my lenses I was
even able to use one of my favorite
lenses the Sigma 1835 F 1.8 which
normally doesn't work on a full-frame
camera a far bigger issue for me is
canons decision to use motion JPEG as
the internal codec in 4k this is an
ancient codec that is basically only
intra frame compression so it's far less
efficient than something like the X AVC
interframe compression in the a7s2 to
put some real numbers to this the data
rate for this codec is 500 megabits per
second so on a 64 gig card I was getting
16 minutes of record time at 4k in 24
fps compare that to the hour and 10
minutes I normally get from the a7s2
on the same card it should be obvious
that aspiring video credits will be
asking for a lot of SD cards and hard
drives for Christmas this year honestly
it feels like they need capped it on
purpose to avoid competition with their
video cameras the mark 4 still only
outputs 1080p over HDMI so any hopes of
bypassing the internal codec for 4k
video can be put to rest the one
redeeming quality the 5d has is the
internal recorded footage looks better
straight off the camera than the
a 7s2 in this shot blown up to 400% the
canon has the edge in overall detail and
in my opinion canons color science is
more pleasing and easier to work with
than sony that said the camera has no
internal log profile limiting its
overall dynamic range so I ended up
shooting most of this footage in neutral
to get the most out of the sensor
without having to use and externally
made profile like cinestyle from
Technicolor on the still side the mark 4
is as expected
excellent raw photos have improved under
exposure recovery particularly in the
shadows something that the mark 3 is
struggle with depending on your image
and over the several shoots I did with
the mark 4 it performed exactly as I
expected which allowed me to forget I
was even using it and focus on shooting
images are sharp and ISO performance has
managed to improve quite a lot as well
so in conclusion the mark 4 is the new
generation embodiment of what has always
been canons goal with the 5d line it's a
full-frame workhorse stills camera that
has a video mode for the casual or
prosumer video enthusiast and it's very
good at what it does stills but if
you're hoping for another mark to a
revolutionary and affordable
jack-of-all-trades camera then i'm sorry
to say that if the mark 4 is anything to
go on that was entirely unintentional
and it's not going to happen again the
zero tech Dobby drone a product whose
name really doesn't make a whole lot of
sense does it so zero tech might imply
that there's no technology but it
actually has a ton in it Dobby well I'm
sure if we put a sock on it it wouldn't
fly away to its freedom and drone ok I
got that part right so it's a selfie
drone that fits and folds into your
pocket with specifications including a
quad-core processor 2 gigs of RAM and
Adreno 330 GPU a 13 megapixel camera
with a 75 degree field of view that can
film 1080 video so you let Dobby take
off from the palm of your hand it pairs
with zero tax ado not fun app which has
built-in tutorials on how to take aerial
selfies and you share the photos you
capture with the drone in real time so
the drone can follow and film moving
people or objects to get the shot you
want and using outdoor GPS tracking you
can film 10-second Auto track short
videos it's got a price tag of 399 US
dollars on amazon.com and you can check
that out
