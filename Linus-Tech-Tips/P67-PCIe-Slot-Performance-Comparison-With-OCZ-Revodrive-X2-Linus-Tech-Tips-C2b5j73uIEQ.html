platform has only 16 PCI Express lanes
available for graphics configurations
well basically available for your main 2
PCIe slot to ensure you a board that
doesn't have stuff installed on it so
you've only got 16 PCI Express lanes for
this one in this one which means you can
either do 16 X and actually I think you
can make it run at 1x so maybe 17 PCI
Express lanes not the point okay so it's
either 16 X or 8 X 8 X on these two now
some Sandy Bridge boards p67 boards that
is have a third PCI Express 16 X
physical slot this isn't the only one
but this is the asou Speidel X and this
one does have a third slot so because
there's only 16 lanes running off of the
CPU itself for those graphics card slots
where does this extra PCIe 16x slot run
off of well the answer is that this is
actually only a PCIe 4x slot and it
actually runs off of the chipset so
there is an inherent delay now the
chipset does get a fair bit of bandwidth
to the CPU itself but that PCIe slot is
actually not tied directly to the CPU
the way that the other ones are so I had
someone ask me a question what if you're
running something like this like an OCC
Revo Drive X to 240 gig I happened to
have one handy this is their performance
difference between running it off of a
PCIe slot that's running off the CPU
versus running it off a PCIe slot that's
running off what is essentially in
archaic terms the Southbridge so this
video is an attempt to answer that I'm
just going to be using crystal disk mark
to keep things simple and so I'm running
five five times the entire test I'm
running it over a four gig span of the
drive and here are my results running it
in the in theory faster PCIe slot and
now I'm going to run it in the other
PCIe slot and see what happens
well it would appear that I have my
answer the sequani
chill numbers are oddly enough very very
close for reads this is running off of
the chipset PCIe slot and then the
screen shot I have here on the left is
running off of the CPU PCI Express slot
so the sequential reads are pretty much
within margin of error the sequential
writes look to be a little bit higher on
the on the chipset PCI Express slot for
whatever reason and then moving down
into the random reads and writes it
looks like four reads we're pretty much
within the margin of error but then for
random writes for whatever reason
actually well random reads here up you
know what overall random performance
seems to be higher on the CPU PCI
Express versus on the chipset PCI
Express and that does seem to be like a
noticeable overall trend so yeah I'm not
sure why that would be maybe it's to do
with the latency is involved although
storage latencies are usually what I
should say is is is chipset latencies
are usually nothing compared to storage
Layton sees so I I wouldn't have thought
that it would affect it that much but it
looks like for whatever reason the the
the lower latency between the CPU and
this PCI Express slot versus the CPU to
that chipset to that PCI Express slot
seems to give us slightly better
performance in random reads both in a
light workload scenario as well as in a
heavy workload scenario so thank you for
checking out this little Linus tech tips
