Cisco's premium app enabled router this
is the EA 4500 it is a direct
replacement for their 4200 router 4200
router I put the emphasis on the wrong
syllable the emphasis that is and this
is the well the biggest differentiating
feature other than being like more
faster and more better and just kind of
more of everything raw is that it is a
pin abled so app enabled means there's
an app for iOS and Android devices to
manage your home network from wherever
you happen to be whether you're on the
same network or whether you're on 3G you
can from a remote location just kind of
go okay well I want Sally to not be on
the internet right now because I just
got a call from her teacher or I'm in a
parent-teacher conference with her
teacher so I'm turning off her My Little
Pony website she's not allowed to go
there anymore in fact I'm going to send
like a packet of death to her computer
for me or not you can't but but what you
can do is you can configure things like
parental controls you can turn the
internet access on and off you can
configure your guests to wireless
network from wherever you happen to be
very conveniently all right what else we
got that makes this the premium like the
the biggest baddest one faster HD
streaming to tablets TVs and mobile
devices
honestly this is sort of this is
anecdotal so just sort of take it take
it with a grain of salt but what I heard
is that there was a major big-box
retailer minute huge returns on tablets
except for one wrench and the difference
was that that one wrench was selling
everyone a new wireless n router with
their new tablet because Wireless G
routers were not giving the same
satisfying experience with Ed enabled
tablets as an n router lesson everyone
thought their tablet was really slow for
browsing the Internet so there you go
they they rolled that out to all the
stores and their return rates went
dramatically down so up to 450 plus 450
megabit per second speed so that is
concurrent 450 plus 450 yes absorb that
guy's up to 900 megabit per second
potentially remember that's all
theoretical 2.4 + 5 gigahertz dual band
maximum range yet I should hope so for a
premium router speed boost technology
gigabit ports USB port for storage or
whatnot DLNA certified which is great if
you have any
the DLNA enabled media players that can
play media using DLNA just good HD plus
3d ready parental controls and easy
setup if you've seen our video on MC IX
tech tips about links this is easy setup
then you'll believe what they say
because it's really really easy built in
with leading Adel 802.11 n broad
compatibility yes it better be a BG n
and Wi-Fi devices simultaneous tool band
talked about that already double the
bandwidth not some speed which is sort
of the same thing as that maximum range
full three by three ml antenna array for
optimal coverage although it is still an
internal antenna so it's not my favorite
but it should still be better than
inferior external antenna setups
increase the signal strength across
greater distances for added in-home
mobility cool okay at security Gigabit
Ethernet ports USB port DLNA certified
media server so that means that anything
that's being stored on a USB Attached
device will be dealing it ready to go
quality of service is supported in ipv6
is supported as well set up and manage
with these quick three-step set up
customizable parental controls and it's
to guest access optional advanced
settings and downloadable app for
community or Gaza so you have the option
of using the browser-based setup in
order to configure it to your heart's
content but links this also gives you
the option of just using the bulletproof
wizard on the CD setup configuration
Eliminator here and it does work and it
does get you going with the basics it
does at least make it so that your new
wireless network is secured if nothing
else and you can set up a guest access
and all that kind of stuff through the
easy network setup wizard so this is one
of the few instances I do recommend
using the CD or even if you're not going
to use it if you buy the router for
someone else because hey that's another
great feature of that remote app and
evil nonsense I'm not going to call
nonsense because it's fantastic because
I can just buy a link sis by Cisco
router for my mom and then if she has a
problem with it I can like reboot it
from here I can fix it in some way
without actually driving there thumbs up
A+ to Linksys for enabling me to do that
power adapter Ethernet cable
yeah that's about it so obviously you
download the app so it doesn't actually
need to include an app in the box like
you half expect like but you know half
expect the kinds of people who are like
you know they want the simplest possible
router so something below despite link
says don't be like owns it's uh turns
with an app for iOS Android on like cat
where is it
I'm just kidding what most people
probably going to do that I also
wouldn't really put it past some people
uh ah
so I think other than the physical unit
this looks pretty much exactly like the
forty two hundred in fact I might
exactly let's go on a journey of
discovery find out if it looks exactly
like a forty two hundred okay stepped on
cat food
that's better not to do that so this is
a forty two hundred and that is my top
panel phone yeah and this is a forty
five hundred so far they're looking
pretty similar ok let's go ahead and oh
right it doesn't come with wall mounting
so I haven't velcro to the wall so I'll
just have to tell you guys New York
don't take my word for it yeah it looks
the same okay back out there we go so
you find passive ventilation holes on
the bottom vents all around the edges
you've also got little rubber stand off
you things here that hold it enough off
the floor that it should be able to get
some airflow going on through there
remember heat does rise in ideal
scenarios for Gigabit Ethernet ports one
Internet port WPS button for easy
wireless setup USB storage port reset
button and finally your power in Jack
