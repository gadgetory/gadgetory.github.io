already done a galaxy geforce gtx 670
unboxing but i'm about to do another one
because this is a non reference gtx 670
so this one uses the reference design
PCB which is the short PCB with the long
cooler thee the blower cooler that
exhausts the air on the back and this
guy is slightly different so although
the specs are pretty similar this one is
slightly overclocked so it's at 1
gigahertz since overclocked right yeah
it's over clock factory overclocked to
just over 1 gigahertz still using 6
gigahertz memory just like the gtx 670
in the gtx 680 before it includes all
the usual features such as the new TXA a
modes which give you the same look as as
older types of anti-aliasing with a
lesser performance hit also includes GPU
boost which dynamically adjust the clock
speed of your GPU according to how much
thermal head room as well as power
Headroom is available to it adaptive
vsync which gives you the best of both
worlds in terms of whether your frame
rate is above your refresh rate you'll
turn on vsync and then if it falls below
then it turns me sing off to optimize
your performance also is very very power
efficient especially considering that
it's a high-end GPU which is something
that you know in generations past was
not really a priority for the you know
the two big GPU makers out there and I'm
sure you guys know who I'm talking about
looks like I never brought my test bench
in here so I can't hold up my 8800 ultra
but that was definitely an example of
performance at any cost compared to what
we're seeing these days with these power
efficient high performance graphics
cards we've got a couple of dual molex
to 6-pin PCIe connectors power
connectors as well as a DVI to VGA
adapter a user's manual and installation
guide as well as a graphics drivers DVD
is included with this card did I miss
any features probably it has two gigs
Murray 1344 cuda cores a 256-bit memory
interface making it a very high-end card
compared to what we want lessee in terms
of how cut down the step down from the
flagship single GPU card is so for
example on the gtx 570 we saw a clock
speed reduction and we've got a clock
speed reduction here although a fairly
less significant one especially for
these factory overclocked cards so we've
got a clock speed reduction we've got a
decrease in the number of cuda cores but
um okay I guess let's pop oh yeah right
right right right right where as with
previous generation products we also saw
decreases in the memory frequency for
example and I think that pretty much
covers it you can boost do-do-do-do
right right three plus one displays are
supported with nvidia 3d vision surround
or just regular surround and then an
auxiliary display we've got dual DVI
output hdmi as well as DisplayPort we've
also got support for 4k monitors and
hdmi 1.4 a which means you got your 3d
and all that good stuff and this is
about as non-reference as a cooler gets
so we've got actually some really cool
branding elements going on here so
geforce gtx 670 kepler that is the
codename you normally never see the code
name on a final product like that so i
think that's kind of a nice touch this
is also this is a metal shout so we've
got an aluminum shroud around 292
millimeter cooling fans on a very very
nice-looking heat sink rate of radiator
style heatsink so it's got four heat
pipes you can see the copper base of it
right in there with the four heat pipes
coming out this is a two gig card so let
me see ya all the memory is installed on
the other side it looks like this is
actually using what PCB design is this
using huh cool so I didn't know that
this wasn't going to be a reference PCB
and you can see how different they are
i'm going to prompt this one up right
here okay so there's a reference p cv
which is this short galaxy has seriously
beef this thing up compared to the
reference design cards so they've moved
the power delivery back over to this
side whereas in video on the reference
card put it over here they
you have just seriously amped up the
cooling involved i mean the the aluminum
cooling portion and i don't know if
you're going to be able to see it you
know you guys are gonna be able to see
it but on the reference card it's you
know about yay big whereas on this card
you can see that it is about yay big and
then they have they have also added a
6-pin an 8-pin pcie power connector
compared to the dual six pins that were
on the reference card I don't remember
oh right right as I was confused look at
this they've actually added like
ventilation holes in the PCB and I can
show you why they've done that because
you can see some of the power delivery
components over here have gaps very
small gaps I'm going to try to get you
guys a bear angle here very small gaps
between these guys and this allows air
flow to go over them more naturally than
if they're if then if it was just a
straight a straight dead stop for the
air and it didn't really have anywhere
to go so that's really cool i haven't
seen that before very neat okay so let's
move on does support multi way sli
configurations hence the two sli
connectors up at the top and it's got
just a very sort of neat look to it and
little galaxies like line squiggly thing
going on over here i already mentioned
we've got the six pin and eight pin pcie
connectors is a completely non reference
card i would expect this to run
significantly cooler than the reference
design which isn't to say that the gtx
570 isn't a cool running card already
but when you've got to 92 millimeter
fans as opposed to one what is that a 16
mil 70ml fan then you can expect it to
run quieter run cooler however the
caveat is that you need to make sure you
have a case with decent airflow because
this guy isn't going to exhaust all of
the air out the back of your computer
whereas this one will so some of the
exhausted air that cooled the GPU is
going to stay inside your case as long
as you have lots of case fans you should
still be fine so I think that pretty
much covers it thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at this
non-reference galaxy geforce gtx 670 and
