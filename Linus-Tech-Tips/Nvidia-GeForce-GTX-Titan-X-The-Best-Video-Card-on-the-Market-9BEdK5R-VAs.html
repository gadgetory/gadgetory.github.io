PR and marketing I really do not because
of the recent three and a half gig
gtx970 fiasco not because of the hours
that I know they work based on when I
get responses to my emails and not
because the hardware that it's their job
to convince us to buy is particularly
hard to sell most of the time I feel bad
for the Nvidia guys because it is got to
be hard to keep finding more and more
creative ways to write reviewers guides
and product pages that exist just to
communicate that this new thing we made
is the world's fastest GPU again because
yes folks they've done it again this is
the gtx titan x the well world's fastest
GPU
course RHA tigt in each one hundred-eyed
GTX all-in-one liquid coolers make your
system run cooler and look better to
click on this graphics card to learn
more let's start with the specs under
the hood of the Titan X you'll find AGM
200 GPU the Big Brother to the Maxwell
architecture GM 204 that powers the GTX
980 and 970 so you've probably guessed
by now that the Titan X is also Maxwell
based but when I said Big Brother I
really meant big the Titan X packs a
whopping 8 billion transistors running
at a base clock of 1 gigahertz with
typical boost speeds around 10
seventy-five megahertz 3072 CUDA cores
12 gigs of gddr5 memory yeah I said 12
gigs all that'll be more relevant for
computational applications and 3d
rendering with large models than gaming
for the foreseeable future running at 7
gigahertz and connected via a 384 bit
bus just like the original Titan and
Titan black and that's not the only
thing it has in common with the original
Titan I mean I wonder whose job it is at
Nvidia to design the reference coolers
does he actually do any work anymore cuz
this one with its copper vapor chamber
aluminum fins and the luminous rod looks
just like the only one I mean maybe
there was like an incident a couple of
years ago where he like bumped into
Jensen in the cafeteria and spilled soup
down the front of his shirt so they
actually laid the guy off and then in a
fit of anger he took the blueprints for
their metal shroud stock cooler so all
they can do now is make slight tweaks to
the color scheme every time which okay
no sorry I don't actually think that's
what happened and at any rate the color
scheme tweak is probably all that this
excellent design needed to look even
more awesome anyway but I still wouldn't
have been too disappointed to see a bit
of a refresh with a brand new top of the
line card the good news though is that
the looks of a graphics card should
probably be the last thing you're
considering when buying it and the Titan
X has got it where it counts gen 3 PCIe
16x connectivity at the bottom dual PCIe
power connectors 1 6 pin and 1/8 pin at
the top and the 6 plus 2 phase power
delivery
designed to handle the cards 250 watt
TDP or 275 watt power limit with it set
to 110 percent in your favorite
overclocking utility it's got two sli
connectors at the top to enable up to
four-way configurations which in my mind
is probably the only way you're going to
get enough horsepower to justify the 12
gig frame buffer for gaming and the rear
i/o takes a page from the rest of its
Maxwell family members with dvi-i hdmi
2.0 for up to 4k 60 Hertz displays and
triple DisplayPort 1.2 ports for 5k
displays like Dells fancy-pants you p27
15 K that we checked out recently here
and surround 4k monitors oh yeah and
they're all compatible with G sync as
well and of course the other new Maxwell
features that will be making their way
into games over the next couple of years
are also present here VX GI and videos
fancy voxel-based real-time lighting
technology MFA a their handy dandy and
automatically applied through GeForce
experience anti-aliasing technique that
delivers very similar results to NSA and
a smaller performance hit and there's
some new stuff like physics which okay
physics isn't new but the CPU based
implementations went open-source which
what Nvidia what is this doing in my
tight necks reviewers guide this
supports the GPU paths of physics just
fine moving on ah you Chaz you want me
to talk about VR features that I can do
even though gaming head-mounted display
products like oculus rift and HTC and
Valve's vive are coming later this year
whatever that means Nvidia is hard at
work reducing the latency between the
frame being rendered and displayed on
your hmd to reduce motion sickness
including a new sli mode that allows
presumably this works with two GPUs one
GPU to render the left eye image and the
second to render the right eye image
dramatically improving performance and
the awesomeness in theory doesn't end
there because we haven't even talked
about overclocked performance of this
beast and for that I will hand off to
Luke but I got a feeling disco and be
good and it is good this card slams the
competition
in terms of single GPU pure performance
and it was able to achieve clearly
higher minimum maximum and average FPS
in all the games we tested if you're
wondering about it's 12 gigabytes of
vram well shadow of mordor with ultra
textures on was able to use about six
point four gigabytes of the stuff but we
will need to push it even harder to see
more utilization here in terms of
overclocking this is a pretty
interesting card that 250 to 275 watt
TDP results in a card that really pushes
in videos heatsink design under load I
was hitting around almost 400 watts from
the wall in terms of power and around 83
to 86 degrees Celsius with the fan on
auto so it's pretty hot but that's not
all it's super power-hungry as well the
first limit I hit was temperature
shortly afterwards
after a little tweaking as well I also
hit power and voltage limits and in the
end I was able to land somewhere around
1375 to 1393 megahertz and NVIDIA specs
you to get around 1400 megahertz so you
may be able to get a little bit more out
of your Titan X on your own one of the
big factors that may have played into my
slightly lower clock speed is the room
house testing in was at a fairly balmy
ambient temperature of 28 degrees
Celsius I'm really hoping someone makes
a really beefy aftermarket cooling and
power solution for this GPU I would
really like to see what the Titan X is
capable of when it's not hitting voltage
power and thermal limits all over the
freaking place maybe hooking up to phase
change could even be a little fun in
terms of price for performance this may
not be the best value card out there if
you but if you want to just crush things
with a single card this may be the
ticket let me know over on the forum if
you'd like to see more tight next videos
and what they should be about maybe an
SLI showdown against maybe dual 980 s or
maybe some sub-zero cooling with a phase
change I don't know let me know anyways
back to you Linus speaking of cool
things are the forum or whatever he was
talking about our friends over at cheero
have recently released a couple of new
dan board products that look pretty damn
compelling ah oh that's awful these are
the dan board but
walk 3040 200 milliamp our batteries to
products that address one of the major
concerns about their previous danboard
products the form factor these are super
thin devices so they're much more likely
to be able to fit into things with the
block and plate at about point five
inches and point four inches thick
respectively of course they still
feature all the same safety measures
like overcharge protection that we're
used to seeing on cheero products but do
so at a size that is much easier to fit
in your pocket oh and they also want us
to show off the new rebel tech Dan board
minifigure which could add a bit of cute
dan board flare to your desk at work or
at home or your gtx titan x not adorable
look at it go on there it's not cute
anyway check out the link in the video
description for more info on all of this
good stuff from our friends over at Chi
row so there you have it the Titan X is
well the fastest GPU in the world
Congrats NVIDIA you've done it again no
wonder you were more focused on putting
chips and cars at CES this year at least
then people will congratulate you for
you know something different for a
change well even if you're bored of
building fast graphics cards over and
over again I for one appreciate it and
as much as I'm looking forward to
spending a lot of time with this GPU I'm
looking forward even more to the next
rabbit that you guys pull out of your
hat keep on truckin guys so that's it
guys like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment hopefully on the forum linked in
the video description if your feelings
are more complicated than that you want
to interact with our community also
linked in the video description we've
got a place where you can give us a
contribution you can buy a cool t-shirt
like this one you can change your amazon
bookmark to one with our affiliate code
so when you buy your shiny new titan x
we get a small kickback that kind of
thing helps us out a lot um I think
that's pretty much it right we have
other channels channel super fun tech
