one cameraman I am up one remote so I
will actually be able to control the
camera with this remote check it out I
can even do this whoo very fancy
anyway today I'm going to be unboxing
and having a quick look at the Antec
easy SATA so what the easy sad is is
it's a five and a quarter inch drive bay
adapter and what you can do is you can
take your five and a quarter inch drive
bay and turn it into a three and a half
inch hot-swap bay that uses get switch
interface SATA and what an text link is
also that it's very very easy to use and
how how the packaging has shattered so
we're off to a bit of a rough start here
ow okay anyway
let's have a look at what is included as
far as accessories so here when you open
up the Box you find the easy SATA
nestled into the packaging there okay so
from the front it looks kind of like
that you do yeah it's kind of hard to do
this actually without a cameraman but
what can you do so there is no
documentation in here whatsoever all we
have inside is a little a little piece
of tape holding eight screws down so
these are five and a quarter inch base
screws and then we have the easy SATA
itself so I guess the assumption is that
this thing is so easy that you don't
even need any instructions on how to use
it so why don't we have a look at the
side of the unit first so there is your
four mounting holes on either side
you're going to use that to mount it in
a five and a quarter inch drive bay okay
so let's have a look at the back so
first of all we have the SATA power and
SATA data connector and then if we flip
it around just a little bit for you here
you can see on the inside that is where
the drive is actually going to interface
with but we also have another SATA cable
at the back so this one comes out of
this one side here and then terminates
into a regular SATA cable that can plug
into your motherboard so that is
actually for an additional eSATA port on
the front of the unit so you can see the
eSATA port right here and you can see
the little door for a hard drive right
there here's your eject button
so basically what Antec wants you to do
is be able to add hot-swap days to the
front of your computer case without any
prior support and without any hassle so
as long as your motherboard supports
ahci
which is native SATA operation then you
should be able to even while your
computer's on popin or pull out a hard
drive and have instant access to your
archived data because the reality of it
is right now hard drives are cheaper
than blu-ray and because they're so big
and so cheap these days they're way more
practical than trying to backup your
data on DVDs so thank you for checking
out my video blog and let's see if this
thing actually works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
