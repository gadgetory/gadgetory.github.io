gaming PC look no further than the
obsidian series 250 d from Corsair click
now to learn more welcome to my second
premium IEM video the automatic er for
PT contrasts sharply with the IE ATS
that I looked at last time where the IE
ATS are targeted at consumers with their
base heavy sound signature great comfort
and stylish look the ER fours are
targeted at professionals with emphasis
on high accuracy sound and exceptional
noise isolation that's not to say
however that general consumers can't
enjoy an accurate in your monitor as
much as a professional from any purists
out there hearing the music the way the
artist intended for it to be heard is
more important than pumping up bass or
playing around with EQ dials to make it
sound better so with that in mind here
we go inside the plastic hard box that
has everything inside of it we find an
accessory package that really looks more
like equipment you'd find in an
audiologists office than something you'd
expect to find in a consumer product box
everything appears to be designed with
practicality in mind but you do get a
lot of stuff with the ER for pts
including a shirt clip an airline
adapter an 8 inch to quarter inch
adapter two sets of large and one set of
small three flange ear tips two sets of
glider ear tips two sets of medium foam
ear tips a filter removal tool and four
filters to help smooth frequency
response and prevent wax buildup and ER
for PT ter 4's adapter cable that
improves sound accuracy but also
increases impedance so it might not be
optimal to use with your phone or other
mp3 player a user's manual a warning and
finally oh yeah a carrying case and
finally the earphones themselves there
is one more thing and it's actually a
little bit unique this is a signed
channel matching compliance graph
showing that one of a domotics
technicians personally checked to ensure
that both of the balanced armature Accu
drivers behaved the same way then signed
off on it before
packaging your product and shipping it
to you a very nice touch now it's time
to focus on the earphones themselves
they look like a piece of equipment and
feel like a piece of equipment the R and
L indicators are simply a red dot for
the one that goes in your right ear
which is fine if you're in a recording
studio but a pain in the butt if you're
on a dimly lit bus each earphone has a
unique thin twisted wire lead that goes
back to a bulky heavy join and then a
much thicker heavier four-foot wire
while the overall length is four feet
that the gauge of the wire is much
thicker here it's unfortunate that it's
so long and heavy because particularly
with the three flange tips which sounded
best for me the weight pulled on my ears
in a way that was pretty uncomfortable
the included clip is an inelegant
solution at best and instead I opted to
wear them upside down and run the wires
over my ear like this they aren't
designed to be worn that way but it
worked reasonably well and saved me at
least once from having the flanges
uncomfortably jerked from my ears
although there was a time when it didn't
save me and that was when I decided to
wear it that way comfort wise I'm not
going to beat around the bush these are
the most uncomfortable earphones I've
ever used your mileage may vary of
course but when the user's manual simply
says moistening eases insertion for the
flanges that's a pretty strong indicator
that a domotic is aware of the situation
lube up because you ain't going to like
it much otherwise the foam your tips
don't hurt but like all foam ear tips
they wear out relatively quickly so
that's not really an option for me I
don't want to be ordering new ones all
the time and the gliders weren't an
option for me either because they don't
seal as well so they're noise isolation
isn't as good as the others and the base
response is not as strong as the others
okay so thanks Linus they feel like a
tool rather than a toy and they're
uncomfortable so why do they have the
right to exist do they have any
redeeming qualities the answer is yes
let's start with their passive noise
isolation I don't have the equipment to
validate their 35 to 42 decibel claim so
all I can do is describe the experience
for you once you get them inserted
they're so deep that even yawning
doesn't affect the sound the feeling of
your surroundings shifts it's like
walking from a crowded ski lodge out
into an empty forest after a fresh
snowfall the entire world just has a
muffled and subdued feel to them the
only thing left is the sound of your own
thoughts except instead of it being your
own thoughts that you hear
it's your music without needing to turn
up the volume to compensate for
environmental noise everything sounds as
crystal clear as if the sounds were
being beamed by magic into your head
every instrument is easily discernible
from the others to agree that I've never
experienced before the difference in
clarity is noticeable when I compare the
ear for PT s to the entire rest of my
stable of headphones which includes
several other products in this price
range and more interestingly the
difference is noticeable with sources
that ranged from listening to music on
YouTube all the way to uncompressed
files of songs that I know very very
well there are some caveats though with
accurate sound comes to some people
boring sound there is no emphasis on
bass to speak of and a domotic has
optimized for isolation rather than
soundstage one of the things that stood
out to me about the IE ATS was how
relatively open they sounded for an IM
whoops there goes my phone the ER fors
take me right back to that traditional
between your ears sound that is
characteristic of IMS something else I
noticed was that switching between the
IE 80s and the ER force felt like
changing the lights in a room from from
a warm glow to a cool glow either is
fine once I'm used to it and after 15
minutes I'm completely adjusted but
side-by-side listening tests were
actually a little bit unpleasant because
the sound signatures of these two
products contrast so starkly going from
ie ad to ER for makes the ER for sound
bland and uninteresting while going from
the ER for to the IE 80s make them sound
bass heavy and muddled by comparison so
what's the takeaway from all of this
bottom line they're just not comfortable
enough for me to use them as my daily
drivers during the day the heavy cable
was a bigger
for me then I actually expected and when
they snag on something accidentally
they're very painful even with them
wrapped around my ears and at night not
being able to tell left from right
without turning on a flashlight is a
pain and then the fact that I normally
sleep in my IMS which is not happening
with these is a showstopper there as
well but they weren't designed to be
daily drivers for general consumers just
look at the website I mean it's
functional sure you can get replacement
parts order custom ear molds for a
hundred bucks which is actually really
cool custom ear molds will fit you
perfectly so comfort problem goes away
and you can learn about the product but
it looks like a hearing aid store or
something they're catering to a
different crowd and comfort aside for me
they sound amazing
I could listen to them with zero fatigue
for hours and I have so if the objective
is not to be fashionable but rather to
get precise sound delivered to your
eardrums with as little outside
interference as possible then the ER
fors get a big thumbs up for me
thank you for watching let me know in
the comments or better yet on the Linus
tech tips forum which will be linked in
the video description if you prefer a
flat sound signature or a more fun
signature knowing that you're not
getting you know the music delivered to
you the way that the artists necessarily
intended like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it guys I'm
totally open to your feedback and as
