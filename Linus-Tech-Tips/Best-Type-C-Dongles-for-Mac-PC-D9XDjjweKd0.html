the expense of onboard i/o the writing's
on the wall the future is going to be a
dongle full one so I can either live in
denial or I can make your dongle
shopping whether you self-identify as a
Mac or a PC a little bit easier
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description let's take a quick
look at all the contenders for dongle
King I ordered from Amazon you'll find
links in the video description before
moving on to performance in order of
cheapest to most expensive this ji ting
product may have multiple typos in the
product description but with its promise
of three USB ports and a wired gigabit
network connection for 18 bucks it
definitely needed a closer look the
Moken USBC 2 USB 3 adapter caught my
attention because at only $20 it offers
four USB ports and a female type c to
handle higher draw devices or charging
pass through this vga and USB hub from a
key stood out as a great option for
business since it still has 4 USB 3
ports and adds VGA for the boardroom
projector for only 6 dollars more or
quite a lot more if you want the HDMI
version n HDMI option for less than that
one this qhe trend adapter looks like a
pretty good deal at $28 as long as you
don't expect to add a ton of USB devices
then if you want to add SD card reader
functionality you're looking at stepping
up to this model from LAN bow or hmm I
actually ordered the same product from
two different brands to see if they were
truly identical and they are I also
picked up this unit from who - because
of its solid reviews and availability in
rose gold
even though it seems a little overpriced
on paper and finally there's the dongle
I ordered a couple of months ago for my
blade laptop the tedious shopping
experience for which inspired this video
the juiced systems biz hub so will
are with what all the devices have in
common they are all lower-cost usb3 not
Thunderbolt 3 meaning bandwidth and
power delivery are both limited so don't
expect to plug in multiple high-power
devices and get the full experience
unless you invest in an external power
brick my attempts to get around this
with another port on the laptop my
attempts to get around this with another
port on the laptop like I've seen with
some external drives in the past were
unsuccessful
though your mileage may vary they all
feel reasonably well built with everyone
except Aki and Moken opting to take it a
step further with a metal housing and
every single one of them was completely
driverless on both PC and Mac this is
especially important for network cards
or SD readers where you might be
plugging them in for the first time out
in the field where there's no Wi-Fi to
download a driver from Windows Update
all the dongles have a short
pre-attached cable eliminating one point
of failure and some manufacturing cost
but making them a little bulkier to
store and meaning you can't repurpose
the included cable to charge your phone
in a pinch and all but the cheapest
dongles used a single continuous metal
jacket for the housing of the connector
instead of this less expensive type now
let's talk about the differences for my
USB transfer test
I used angel bird's SSD to go pkt one
terabyte the angel bird folks provided
us with these for video editing when
we're at shows and they are lit AF they
have excellent performance consistency
and gave me easily repeatable results
every hub performed nearly identically
with my 10 gigabyte test file taking
about 30 seconds to transfer from the
SSD to the desktop
curiously Apple's MacBook Pro USB 3
performance was better across the board
than the Razer Blade late 2016 when
transferring between SSDs
the more robust hubs flexed their
muscles a little bit
not necessarily in terms of speed but in
terms of completing the race at all I'll
forgive requiring extra wall power to
handle a couple of SSDs but who to mokan
and qhe trend all failed this test
miserably for a variety of reasons
as for HDMI output all of these hubs are
HDMI 1.4 so up to 4k 30 Hertz and all
but the qhe trend performed exactly as
expected with that one working on the PC
but not on the Mac for some reason all
the hubs with SD card readers were able
to max out our 90 megabyte test card
from Kingston no one was trying to sneak
a USB 2 card reader chip in there which
was nice but the same can't be said for
Ethernet if you were hoping for full
gigabit speeds the Zhi ting is too good
to be true it's faster than 100 megabit
but not nearly as fast as the juiced
systems so conclusion time then I'm
feeling great about the choice I made
with the juiced systems biz hub it runs
a little warm and it's one of the most
expensive but it's a compact one-piece
solution that saves me from carrying
additional dongles for proper full speed
Gigabit Ethernet and reading SD and
micro SD cards the akhi adapters blew me
away with their power efficiency they
were the only ones that could reliably
power two SSDs on both Windows and Mac
OS without external power making the VGA
one a great option even if you pretty
much just want a USB hub and the G ting
gets my value award it doesn't have
charging pass-through or the highest
performance but it's really compact and
cheap if you just want more USB ports
and a wired network connection but what
if what you really want is an easier way
to do your accounting ah yes for that
