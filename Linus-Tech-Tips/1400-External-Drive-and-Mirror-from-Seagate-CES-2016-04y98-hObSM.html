three tiers of products although only
one of them is going to make me cry
let's find out why so we'll start as
always with a huge shout out to
Squarespace for allowing us to be here
at CES 2016 check out the link in the
video description to learn more about
Squarespace as if you don't already know
everything about them already it starts
right here with the backup plus ultra
slim which as you you imagine it if
folks out there might be able to imagine
is ultra slim so it's a seven millimeter
drive inside a 9.6 millimeter plastic
enclosure it's got a standard USB 3 mini
be that sort of goofy dual connector
thing on the back and other than the
fact that it comes with a couple hundred
gigs of cloud storage is not really that
different from other small slim external
drives that Seagate has done in the past
it's available in one and two terabyte
capacities and has got kind of this like
honeycomb design that I'm sure you know
someone at Seagate worked really hard on
and then was like super upset when
Seagate was like well we're gonna do a
more premium one it's gonna have a metal
enclosure but we're gonna turn to
Porsche to design this so you know
Johnny from Johnny from industrial
design you can just kind of maybe take
like a couple month leave of absence we
can have someone else work on this one
but the good news is that Porsche design
actually did do a pretty nice job of it
it's an all aluminum ID it's got kind of
that beveled edge thing going on which I
guess if you're into the looks of
products is kind of cool there's a
relatively thin one and there's also
available on a four terabyte capacity a
much thicker one but if you're like me
and you're all in tooling specs in
megabytes and connectors then the real
cool stuff is actually on the back where
it's got a USB type-c connector and this
is man these standards have gotten
confusing 3.1 Gen 1 so that's five
gigabit that's like what we used to call
USB 3.0 but for some reason they're just
want to make all of our heads explode so
thanks for that there's also a desktop
version of this one available on 4 5 and
8 terabytes also same thing super speed
USB 3.1 gen2
etcetera and this one has external power
a to power the drive and B this is cool
you can power up and charge your MacBook
with it if you connect via that a single
connector that Apple in their infinite
wisdom put on
Macbook retina which leads us to the one
that makes me cry a little bit and
there's different kinds of tears
associated with this as well although
this is definitely the top tier product
so they turn back to anneal Paulton to
design this very mirror like what
they're calling the chrome a because
that is how to achieve true
pretentiousness to put an axial a goo on
the end of a word that would have
otherwise worked simply fine
so the chroma is actually a solid state
based drive even though it's in a three
and a half inch drive like looking
enclosure size it's got this like sick
magnetic base like check this out like
it it's like stuck there you go so it's
got this magnetic base that it like
locks on to like really goes on to this
one uses USB 3.1 gen2 or whatever -
anyway ten gigabit per second
connectivity through a type-c connector
also has external power and there's a
lot of cool stuff under the hood here it
uses two MDOT to SSDs inside for a total
capacity of one terabyte and you're kind
of sitting here going well on a second
like it looks like a hard drive it's got
Seagate on the outside of the blob well
let's see actually Seagate owns let's
see I should have probably clarified
that why does it have an SSD inside well
my friends it's for performance this
puppy is capable of 1 gigabyte per
second read speeds over that type-c
connector pretty freakin amazing right
when can I sign up you probably won't
unless you're the same type of customer
that's heading over to the sennheiser
booth to preorder the $50,000 Orpheus
because this my friends is a $1,300
external hard drive except that it's an
SSD but you know whatever we're not
gonna we're not going to nitpick these
little details yes my friends it is not
cheap but it is beautiful and the
reality of it is is that while the the
tears I cry over the performance are
tears of joy and the tears I cry over
the price are tears if I can't afford
one what I do like
about this is that we at least Seagate
through the Lisi brand has the cojones
to say okay we're gonna build a premium
product and we are gonna price it like a
premium product and sure you can still
buy a plastic hard drive but you also
don't have to you know if your desk
costs as much as someone else's car in
your office you can put this on it and
you can feel like a big shot
I know I would so thanks for watching
