so I'm here for the Samsung Note 8
launch
I forgot my shaving supplies and they
didn't have a budget to send me with a
camera person so I have to figure out
how to put this camera together oh I
wish Brandon was here yeah
the Corsair one features a compact form
factor that is fast quiet and you
guessed it compact check it out through
Amazon or Newegg at the links below ok
well at least the camera will look good
even if the operator doesn't I think
I've got the audio working I'm not sure
the audio level monitoring is here but
I'd love to play around with this but in
my infinite wisdom I didn't bring a
charger for the batteries so I've got
what I've got and besides I've got to be
over at the event in late oh great don't
have a charger for that either
ok so hopefully this sounds ok because
otherwise I'm screwed I still don't know
exactly what today's format will be so
right now I'm just lamenting that I
didn't bring a better way to carry this
stupid camera around with me all day
this thing is very heavy and I'm filled
with regret right now but on a positive
side Ubisoft followed me on Twitter
oh my god
they break my skills but hold on you're
out of focus
oh man I can't even use the phone great
fish kills them how - oh wait wait my
skills on operating the red camera out
of 5 1.2 oh my god there's so many
stairs this thing is so heavy
fortunately for everybody who's with me
I've resolved to suffer in silence all
the silence that's pretty good
I got Austin's approval let's not be
rash here and say approval it's not
throw works like that around also you
can sue men right like you can do like
something oh I could yo rate I do a
little write business a zoom lens yeah
so you can do like that and get actual
proper eek oh there you go there we go
8k Wi-Fi password booyah oh man I
finally pull out the camera and it's
over
and now I get to hold it down all the
stairs it's a good thing I got all that
great footage
presentation
in a que
you've got Thank You rotations 3
watermelon amazed Victorian as you later
hey guys we can just wait here for a bit
drop on the stairs well come on like
this is a concern I'm trying to get me
walking on the crazy water display and I
can't even get my SSD them out come on
red
there's one thing this is an epic epic
fail wow this is a super trippy oh I'm
not apparently allowed to be out here
well everyone else was walking on it it
is a freakin zoo in here try and get
some oh you have gotta be kidding me
Austin's Meg isn't mounting now either
I'm gonna have a new red rant pretty
soon the last one was it's expensive the
next one's gonna be it doesn't work when
you need it to work your Meg's not
detecting dude it's really broken look I
know I'm not even joking it's gonna be
your camera dude well I mean that's not
good news either oh this is like
terrible I'm not using and just shoot it
on the iPhone yeah after four minutes of
detecting we have SSD okay time to get
some flares before I breathe on it too
hard alright so let's get some initial
handling impressions here well Bixby is
still there so if you were hoping that
wasn't then you were hoping wrong in
fact one of the big things they were
talking about is how you can use Bixby
to essentially program like
voice-activated macros which does sound
kind of cool although I'd have to spend
some time with it to evaluate exactly
how well it works like the note 7 the
hold ability is much better than
previous notes for me thanks to the
rounded shape along the edges I don't
know how people do this whole like
filming yourself like I'm back here
trying to hold it up and keep it in
focus this is impossible
Austin you just wrecked my shot again
bro I was trying to show off the Bixby
button Wow what Wow I always get such a
kick out of people who carry around
cleaning cloths for phones because like
I carry around a cleaning cloth it's
called my shirt sucka
look at that okay well it didn't do a
great job
yeah maybe worse wow I think it's is
that scratch oops
I don't even drop it look babe it
installed - drop proof floors this
carpet so we're actually going to lunch
with Samsung back Erik going out bad
lunch ish so I don't really need the
lunch but check this out it's like a
it's like a happy meal you don't really
want the food but it's the goodie that's
that's important it's got a spins inside
okay I can't find my yes pen well one of
them's an S Pei it's got like a little
plastic covered on it but the other two
are just pencils well now I feel like an
idiot for shooting anything back at the
event this place is way cooler check
this out and Ebers here too and we've
got our own phones to run around and
shoot b roll bit so as long as the
cameras working then hopefully i'll get
some more footage here good news the
camera is working and the more serious
setting is gonna bring about a more
serious tone to the rest of the video
let's talk about some actual impressions
here so number one ergonomics a lot of
what was good about the note 7 returns
like the note 7 this is a phablet that
is actually hold a ball even with my
tiny lady hands part of that is due to
the fact that the sides are curved on
both the front and the back and another
part of it is actually due to this flat
part that they've got on both the left
and right side it gives it a little bit
more grip around the edges and I
personally really like the change other
changes the screen it's still the 18 and
a half by 9 aspect ratio that I
personally absolutely loved on the
galaxy s 8 just more of it whether
you're scrolling through you know long
walls of text or your twitter or
instagram feed or watching wide aspect
ratio content like Brandon's recent
review of the red weapon 8k camera
there's just more of it to love I'm a
huge fan I
absolutely love the taller size with
that said it does affect ergonomics a
little bit and I'm probably not the only
one who was really hoping that Samsung
was going to deliver an under screen
fingerprint sensor on this guy rather
than the one at the back because it
takes me a couple shuffles to get up
there to unlock the phone another
improvement on the screen though is the
always-on functionality so I checked
this out on the show floor but now you
can actually create up to a hundred
pages of notes just on your lock screen
in a way that consumes very little power
and allows you to quickly jot down like
a tracking number or phone number or
whatever else the case may be the camera
is already generating some mixed
feedback the telephoto lens which has a
2 X optical zoom does not capture images
that are nearly as sharp as the
wide-angle but for me personally I don't
mind the approach because with dual
capture you've got the option to do the
whole like adjust the background blur
bokeh thing in post which is neat if
you're into that kind of artsy stuff but
it's really not my bag but for me what's
cool about dual capture is the fact that
I don't really have to compromise so I
can try and capture the close-up but if
they kind of look soft or doesn't look
as good or I got the framing kind of
wrong then at least I can fall back to
the wide-angle shot and know that I've
captured the moment which is far more
important for me when it comes to cell
phone cameras on the subject of things
that matter to me styluses generally not
so much the note 7 was my first note
device and I had precious little time
with it before the recall so I never
really have gotten in a habit of using a
stylus but apparently this one's better
than ever with more pressure levels and
lower latency so I look forward to you
know kind of tinkering around with it
over the next couple of weeks while I
work on my flow review and on that
subject Bixby voice has finally launched
in Canada so when I did my s8 review
Bixby seemed pretty freaking pointless
just a regrettably Unruh mapable button
on the side that i would always hit by
accident and that would annoy me
hopefully I'll change my mind
their pitch for it is like pretty
hardcore than like yeah you can change
your Wi-Fi
you can adjust your screen brightness it
to do everything but that remains to be
seen I've been promised that I can talk
naturally to my device and it will
behave in a way that I'd expect a lot of
times and it's never really come through
but one thing that's gotten my attention
is apparently the ability to program
Bixby with like macros so you can tell
it to take a picture save it to a
particular album
and open up a photo editing program or
something like that whether you're
sending a few quick emails from the
airport's free Wi-Fi network er doing
some emergency banking at that random
