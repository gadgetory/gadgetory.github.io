Sabre 255 I and this is yet another
high-end p55 motherboard from asou so
this is not part of their Republic of
gamers brand this is actually a new
gaming brand for masseuse the ultimate
force or tough get it the ultimate yeah
okay so features on this board we've got
a lot of the usual a sous high-end
features but we also have some new ones
first of all is ceramics heatsink design
so basically the okay they're coating
the heat sinks with ceramic which
apparently gives them better heat
dissipation okay cool mem fan frame you
can attach a fan to your memory slots
for better cooling okay efficient
switching design Oh tough caps and
MOSFETs okay so there's more information
on this inside but that means that
they're tough okay we'll get more into
that later temp probes drive expert and
mam okay their technology for making
sure that even high-end memory will post
okay as long as you press this button
it'll set it to a safe setting so this
is a Windows 7 ready board it supports
LGA 1156 CPUs that means core i7 or Core
i5 CPUs so as soon as we get this box
open we see the board itself which we're
going to get to after the accessory
package so inside the accessory package
we have an i/o shield okay there you go
io shield we have one IDE cable so we
can assume based on that that there is
an IV report on this motherboard we have
the Q connectors which are color-coded
with the tough color scheme rather than
the traditional blue and white kind of
nice touch there then we have what is
this oh this is the fan bracket to
attach a fan to your memory modules it
doesn't actually include the fan itself
though then we have an SLI bridge okay
the crossfire bridge should be included
with your video card if you need one
then we have two USB and one eSATA on a
little PCI backplate six SATA cables
three of which are right angle and three
of which are just straight connectors
and then here last but not least we have
a user guide along with your driver CD
and then even Laster but not least err
you have a certificate of reliability
that
kind of cute okay so your capacitors or
thermal shock tested moisture resistance
tested salt spray tested because that'll
be useful solder ability test solder
bath test vibration test mechanical
shock test and the MOSFETs I'll have a
bunch of tests to Wow okay
so let's get this board open now you
know maybe some people like this but the
first thing that comes to my mind is oh
man that is the ugliest color scheme
I've seen under the Seuss board since
they were using that cardboard colored
PCB it is meant to be very military
looking so this is the kind of thing
you'd expect to find like strapped to
the side of a tank I guess okay so let's
go over the basic features of this board
first of all let's do the power
connector so we have our 24-pin power
along the right edge just where it's
supposed to be then we've got an 8 pin
power connector up at the top now mom
here I guess I can check out these heat
sinks so the heat sinks have what looks
like kind of a fine fur and that's the
ceramic coating on them that apparently
really helps with heat dissipation so
for the CPU socket we have one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve plus two phases for the
CPU and then a couple phases for the
memory as well
I bet the talk we have an over volt Ram
button that's kind of cool to see and
then we've got the memo okay button here
as well as an LED indicator for your RAM
this heatsink down here is also ceramics
up okay we got four SATA ports on the
side so force right angle SATA ports and
then we have four more at the top so the
black ones are all controlled by the p55
chipset whereas the orange and white
ones are controlled by aji micron
chipset like many high-end boards we've
got onboard power and reset switches
although not an onboard clear CMOS which
you have to actually set the jumper for
that right here okay so we got two PCI
Express 16x slots which run in 8x8 X
mode if you are using two cards and then
we have three additional PCIe 1x and 2
PCI slots something really cool that I
just noticed about this board is it has
an awful lot of four pin fan connectors
so actually no not really okay it has
two four pin fan connectors so two PWM
fan connectors but it has a lot of other
three pins
okay so let's have a look at the aisle
on the back we got two ps2 ports eight
USB ports one optical audio out eSATA
firewire one gigabit ethernet I'm
surprised to see only one Gigabit
Ethernet although I mean I've never
really understood why you need more than
one on a on a consumer-level board 7.1
audio and something I wanted to observe
about this particular board is that I
have finally found something that
matches the Noctua color scheme thank
