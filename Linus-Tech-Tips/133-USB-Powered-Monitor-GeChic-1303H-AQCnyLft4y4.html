screen for a second or two or for
something like a raspberry pie or
desired a small additional screen for
your laptop while you're on the road or
even just a portable monitor in general
well Kashyyyk sent us there on lap 13
o3h portable monitor so stay tuned to
see how that stacks up and like the
video if you guys are interested in
seeing an exploration kind of video
where we see where the value is and 3d
printing something or just buying it
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors click now to learn
more
the 1303 h portable monitor is a 60
Hertz IPS 1080p 13.3 inch screen powered
by 5 volts running at 2 amps which can
be received by up to 2 different input
ports just in case you're having a hard
time hitting that amperage level off of
one cable it has a built-in speaker
which is really not that great but I
didn't expect much from it considering
the size of the overall package it's
good enough to troubleshoot things which
is cool I guess and if you want to
bypass it you'll be happy to hear that
there's a 3.5 millimeter audio jack on
the side as far as inputs go there's a
surprisingly large range supported all
the way from VGA to HDMI and DisplayPort
which is awesome because this is an
impressive amount of inputs for a little
monitor one actually fairly major gripe
though that I have with this setup
however is that the inputs require a
connector that is the same as a micro
HDMI connector which is the only actual
cable that's included in the box
notice how the VGA input is the same as
the HDMI input this may leave you
wanting instead of satisfied because the
only cable included is for HDMI meaning
that if you want to use a VGA connector
or a DisplayPort connector you need to
go by the cable off of their website
because I don't personally know anywhere
else where you can buy something like a
VGA cable that terminates in VGA and
micro HDMI so I try to do that so I
could tell you guys how expensive it was
but unfortunately their website
currently has a program execution error
so I guess that's not really going to
work out for me looking on Amazon also
showed cables from this company but they
were priced at about 20 bucks each which
is pretty rough considering I found a
VGA cable for literally 36 cents I
appreciate the range of inputs I just
wish they would have either had a better
solution for this or included all the
cables or adapters in the box on the
other side there's a bunch of buttons
like power and random settings changes
that show up on standard monitors as
well like changing the input or
brightness this is standard fare
are no grapes here the buttons aren't
too BIG's they don't often get pressed
when you have the case on and they're
easy enough to press when you really
want to speaking of the case this thing
is freakin awesome I realize that I'm
getting quite excited over what many
people are probably going to think is
the most boring part but seriously it's
great not only does it double as a multi
positional landscape stand by utilizing
and extremely easy to use magnetic arm
thing that's hosed on the back of the
stand but probably the coolest part is
the fact that it will protect the screen
and transport by covering it up and
adding some soft padded areas on the
inside there are other portable screens
on the market but having them break and
transport has been a pretty constant
issue with certain ones of them this
should help alleviate those problems
lastly we have actual visual appearance
which is actually pretty solid the
screen isn't all that big which is
understandable so the 1080p doesn't
actually look horribly stretched out
like it can on like a TV or something
the IPS panel looks quite good even at
wide angles and it's brightness isn't
anything to complain about Brandon even
said that it looks good enough to kind
of use as an editing monitor on the road
which is high praise aesthetics wise the
bezel is pretty huge and it's really not
that thin in terms of the actual unit
itself but I'll give it a pass here due
to the added benefits of durability I
guess so let's run through some usage
scenarios the first two I wanted to try
we're pretty straightforward but
directly related to what we do for work
first I had Brandon hook it up to one of
our filming cameras to use as an
external monitor this could really help
someone who's trying to film things solo
fixing your position or the position of
some object in the shot would be a lot
easier if you can see it in a nice large
frame which could also be much closer to
you but there were some issues here for
some reason the screen would throw a
signal out of range error unless it was
set to 60 P 1080p 60 720p 60 480p 60
didn't matter just as long as it was
running 60 P kind of weird this may be
look into the manual that actually
happens to say read before usage on it
so yep those previously stated working
settings are clearly laid out as the
only supported settings with the
addition of 1080i60 now while I'm sure
the mast
race is like oh well I see literally
zero problems here this isn't a good
thing
this can cause compatibility issues for
a monitor that I really just want to
work all the time and while most things
will work just fine it will actually
narrow the potential list of use cases
including who will use it say what you
will about frame rates in movies and
videos but our camera guys won't
normally film in 60 unless they're
planning on slowing it down which makes
this thing useless for them then we have
the simplest scenario of them all which
is probably the most common use case for
this monitor a travel monitor
unfortunately we can't really test this
but I put it through a baggage handling
scenario and then plug it into a laptop
and it worked so that's a pass in my
condition if it can survive the baggage
scenarios of going through transit then
we have the idea of a troubleshooting
monitor and Raspberry Pi monitor being
able to take this thing around and test
other people's systems and problems
especially if they're having a display
issue could make things a lot easier but
my favorite part is actually you could
just take it around to any of your
randomly deployed raspberry PI's or
other various mini computers you have to
check in on them and perform diagnosis
really easily without having to haul a
monitor around if you can't connect to
them through a network for some reason
in conclusion yeah this thing's cool and
it does have its uses but it's still not
a whimsical purchase at three hundred
and thirty US dollars for a 13.3 inch
1080p 60 Hertz screen that you have to
buy really expensive cables to use
anything but HDMI with you're really
gonna need to justify the portability
aspect to make it worth it which I'm
sure some of you will totally be able to
do so and honestly I'm already pretty
excited about bringing it on trips in
order to help the editors so they can
have a dual monitor setup for their
laptop so I don't know
