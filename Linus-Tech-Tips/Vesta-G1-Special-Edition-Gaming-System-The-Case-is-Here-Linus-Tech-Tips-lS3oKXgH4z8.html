about the vestige e1 so I showed you
guys the test platform before you can
see that it's back there still so
there's more validation to be done
before we can release a system like this
to the public but we have our first case
our our prototype case back from the
painter now so I want to show you guys
we obviously haven't put it back
together properly yet because you can
see there's no latches here there's no
window you know the stock fans aren't
back in it yet but I just wanted to show
you guys the green that we've come out
with here so this is a base coat and a
clear coat and then the clear coat is
polished in order to give us a very very
nice smooth green finish to the case
we've gone with the same color scheme as
last time around and since this is a
actually here I'm just going to take
this off since this is a making-of style
video I just want to show you guys we
did try it the other way around so we
did take your suggestions and tried the
look of it with the black base and the
black mesh and and the green the green
front panel and the reality of it is
first of all this doesn't come off so
it's a bit of a masking nightmare to get
a really clean line around it the reason
for that is that this plastic piece is
actually screwed blued and clipped to
the front metal bezel of the case so
it's very very difficult to remove
especially with the glue in there it was
pretty much impossible so we can't
remove this piece which makes masking a
nightmare plus the fact that it is kind
of oddly shaped shaped makes it
difficult to get good coverage on it and
then we went and put it on we were like
oh that's a little lot of green actually
so we decided to go with the same kind
of color scheme as we did with the best
to our watt one where we're going to
have the green grill at the front but
otherwise black on the front green on
the top and then I'm just
take you guys around to the other side
panel also bright green on the other
side panel so I'm going to tip this up
so you guys can see the color a little
better so it's reflected off the white
ceiling rather than the system next to
it but it looks just gorgeous so I think
whoever ends up with a vestige e1 which
we're looking at right now a production
run of only 20 systems is going to be
very very pleased with it
