yesterday there's been a ton of demand
to do at least a couple benchmarks maybe
some overclocking on the asyou series so
here it is installed in a core i7 test
platform I'm running whoops I'm tripping
all over things I'm running six gigs of
ram over there I'm running a core i7 980
x6 core Extreme Edition processor and
the asou Ares so I've got my three
graphics card PCI Express power
connectors plugged in two of these are
810 one of them is a six pin so the
other two pins are just hanging off the
edge there if you listen you can hear
that the fan is actually quite silent
now I would love to use the asou smart
dr. software and it'll probably fix this
later but you can see right now it comes
up with an error that says cannot find a
C's graphics card so I'm gonna be using
afterburner so that one detects it
properly graphics card issues aries
driver version latest catalyst drivers
so just to give you some idea of how
this card runs where my phone's going
off there we're gonna go ahead and okay
so i'll let you listen to it at at
default auto speeds so this is what the
fan speed at 20% and now I'm gonna turn
the fan speed up to a hundred just to
get you give you some idea how high this
thing can go
pretty impressive I'll be surprised if
you can actually even hear me very well
that's right up there with that GTX 480
levels of noise production there's a
significant amount of airflow coming out
of either side of this charge very very
very significant anyway let's turn that
back to auto there we got Rams right
back down so we're gonna run 3dmark
Vantage see how loud it actually gets
during the benchmark here and what kind
of scores we get out of this particular
card and then we're gonna overclock it
and see how much we can improve it
beyond that during the benchmark run
this is about what it sounds like the
ambient temperatures in my office here
are 26 degrees Celsius and I'm taking
that temp from right in front of the
graphics part so you can easily compare
that sound level to the one that I had
before if with the card running at Auto
at idle at the desktop as well as the
100% load it's not not intrusive ly loud
although it is definitely definitely
audible and this is at a non overclocked
setting ok the benchmarks done so add
stock speeds with a 4 gigahertz core i7
980 X CPU actually it's three point nine
nine something high not Clay four
gigahertz anyway we get about 30,000
marks in 3d marks so that's the
performance preset and let's have a look
at what we're seeing in terms of GPU
temperatures so GPU one peaks at around
67 degrees and my room is running at
about 4 my temp probe back on give it a
minute
my room is running a little oh it's
running a give it a sec running about
the same it's running at about 26
degrees so we see it go as high as about
40 a 40 degree Delta up as high as 68 or
so here GPU 2 runs quite a bit cooler
actually about 10 degrees cooler on GPU
- what I'm guessing is that this is GPU
1 and this is GPU 2 because you can see
the airflow comes out completely
unrestricted from this side of the card
but over here you've got this PCI dock
plate blocking it so you
get as much as much air being vented out
that way
now in terms of everything else you can
see GPU usage is as high as 99% on both
and GPU fan speed well that's
interesting it doesn't seem to detect
fan speed correctly in afterburner here
for some reason
because I know it went up higher than
that let me see if I can well yeah I
know fan speeds just not um I can't even
adjust it now I just did that a minute
ago anyway
I'll be back with more overclocking
benchmarks thank you for checking out my
video blog and I'll be updating you
shortly
actually here I should explain this the
the 1.5 gigahertz is just because of
speed step it goes up to 4 gigahertz as
soon as you do anything there example
