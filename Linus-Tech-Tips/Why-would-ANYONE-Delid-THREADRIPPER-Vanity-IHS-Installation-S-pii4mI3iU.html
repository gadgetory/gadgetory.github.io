the risin thread ripper 1950 x AMD cent
- looks like 250 publications one of the
coolest pieces of swag of all time this
right here in a custom in krill ik
magnetic case is a vanity Rison thread
ripper with an engraving of the name of
the publication so in our case that's
Linus tech tips on the integrated heat
spreader there's only one small problem
this doesn't work so today's objective
is to remove the vanity spreader from
this one and put it back together with a
working 1950 X
Sennheiser's PXE 550 wireless headphones
feature up to 30 hours of battery life
noise guard hybrid adaptive noise
cancellation and more check them out at
the link below so for our experiment
we're gonna need a few things the vanity
processor a working processor with the
carrier plate we're gonna need a thread
Ripper compatible cooler when we fire it
up to find out if it still works so
we're gonna use an NH 214 STR for SP 3
from Noctua we're gonna need a thread
Ripper board so we've got an RG zenith
extreme and finally this piece of
beautiful artwork from the der bauer our
dare bauer okay look my Germans not that
good this is the one prototype that I'm
aware of of a thread Ripper D living
tool I'm also gonna need one of these
because the integrated heat spreader is
soldered we are gonna have to melt the
solder in order to remove it
alright so let's put this baby on here
number thirty-nine of 250 you know I
probably wouldn't be willing to to do
this to it if AMD had given me the
number one that I deserve instead of
number thirty-nine wonder who got number
one where are the heating elements you
know what yeah let's uh fine let's just
put it here so we want to throw this in
because we don't really want to reach
exactly 355 we want to get a little
lower than that about 15 degrees Celsius
less than that that's when the solder on
the CPU is actually going to melt and
that's when we're gonna be able to pop
it off ah hold on wait I just thought of
something there's fingerprints on the
CPU right now I don't know if these
gloves are gonna be good enough but it
shouldn't be that hot yet if we bake
this thing now it's probably gonna like
bake them onto it because of the grease
and oils
shoot okay perfect
okay I heard a little noise but I'm not
a hundred percent sure what it means
unfortunately this oven doesn't have a
readout for what the actual temperature
is inside it's possible that it's about
a hundred degrees Celsius right now what
it's also possible that it's 250 uh-oh
wait what what temperature that I wanted
it okay we might have thoroughly this
thing oh this is Fahrenheit
hold on how could it possibly be oh oh
because of the heating elements right
above it the radiant heat
okay well it's do or die time with this
is this gonna melt
I feel fast enough oh this is making me
nervous go oh my God look at the way
it's mashing the PCB there wow this is
the be-all and end-all of failed
experiments right now yeah I don't think
it shifted it one bit okay so new
developments we broke off the screws
over tightening it last time shear them
right off I drilled them out I put new
ones in those ones sheared off while I
was trying to put them in because I
didn't have quite the right threading
blah blah blah so we've got a new system
I grabbed some leftover pieces of 16k
gaming cool we were just gonna like self
tap this okay speech let's give it the
full heat so we may have to wait another
5 or 10 minutes or so
there it is oh there it is there it is
there it is okay oh it's beautiful oh my
just drop that that was the good side
yeah
so here's our dummy chip so I want to
get the honks off quickly while it's
still soft here remember guys there's
nothing to damage here we're just
practicing this is pure practice what do
you think hellish I do it should I risk
$1,000 processor I mean you only live
once right this is it
the real chip goes in now while I'm
waiting for that actually I can work on
my technique for removing the silicon
glue I really like what AMD has done
they've put like some kind of glue or
resin or something over all of these
inner surface mount components here
means that if you slip a little bit
you're very unlikely to knock one off
I've done that that's a lot of pressure
I'm putting like no bastard oh there it
is there it is theoretically working
chip okay so now come on come up now
it's the optimal time to get that off
but I also don't want to spill it so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna flip it
upside down
oh wow as soon as I touch it it
solidifies oh no that one came off great
see see how easy they come off while
it's nice and warm especially if it's
not good which there's a good chance
it's not so here's kind of a funny idea
I see diamond thermal compound is well
known to be fairly abrasive so I won't
be using it on the top of the IHS but
check this out
look how much it shined up that guy just
like that it's like two seconds so it
takes off this takes off this solder
like nobody's business I don't know
which way this goes on so that's a thing
yes it doesn't really matter no I put a
little more pressure on it than I wanted
we are yoloing this no I wouldn't
recommend this yes it anyway okay we're
getting to the point now where if I
accidentally slip with it you lose the
IHS
[Laughter]
so I forgot about this stage which means
there's some drying time involved let me
just find out how long that takes to dry
this is actually a broken carrier but I
can't find our replacement ones so if
you ask it nicely it won't snow right it
slipped okay
carrier thing is as long as we get the
CPU down it doesn't really matter that
the carrier frame is kind of Ubar I
don't think I'm gonna truth learn moment
of truth does it work does the vanity
CPU work I don't remember the
application method for Red River so
we're gonna do it oh what a mess Oh
terrible here we go memory eight CPU
it's still on CPU oh it's still on CPU
Oh what's updating no shut up not now oh
this is not a good sign
code zero D the post error
okay so what's code 0d it's like the one
thing that i could possibly want in a
motherboard manual plus code zero beyond
rampage extreme blah blah blah
disable ASM storage off brown yeah help
me one thing is that I only have one a
pin CPU connector plugged in and it is
recommended to have two for thread
Ripper shoot is not a good sign
okay why are we getting further before I
forgot to plug in the HDMI connected 0d
poster oh no way it's up 32 gigs round
detected it's up the vicinity cpu works
you have got to be freaking kidding me
oh man okay so with the OS loaded I'm
gonna wait for it to reach equilibrium
