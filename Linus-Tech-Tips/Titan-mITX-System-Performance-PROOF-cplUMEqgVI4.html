Corsair obsidian 350d micro ATX case
exceptional expansion and cooling
flexibility for compact high performance
PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more so we built up this system a
long time ago this is our tiny mini ITX
35 70 K overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz by
the way so 35 70 K overclocked and GTX
Titan
this little mini ITX system now we had a
lot of people questioning us when we did
the original build ok Linus so you put
it in there but Titans great at
dynamically reducing clock speeds in
order to conserve itself thermally and
so you know is it actually gonna boost
up to the same level that you advertised
in your benchmarks and all that stuff if
you put it inside such a small enclosure
so in order to respond to that we built
the system back up we actually had taken
it apart since the GTX Titan launched
other than leaving pretty much I think
there was just the hard drives and
motherboard left in there so I want to
show you guys what we find in terms of
temperatures I've been playing far cry 3
blood dragon here so we're gonna fire up
EVGA precision check this out
so we set our power target to 106
percent as well as our temp I get to 90
degrees which is the same that we used
for our overclocking we turned up our
memory clock offset and our GPU clock
offset check this out so we are running
consistently at anywhere from around
1050 megahertz to as high as 1100
megahertz
on the GTX Titan in a real world gaming
scenario and we're seeing power anywhere
from around 92 to around a hundred and
around a hundred percent so it is
definitely running and our ambient
temperature so we're taking the ambient
temperatures right at the intake for the
case around 23 degrees so it's not balmy
hot but it's also not super chilly in
here either the way that it was when we
did our original video back when Titan
launched so I'm gonna show you guys the
close quarters that you're gonna find
our Titan system in so this is in our
qubit tech oh crap I forget what it's
called I believe it's called the mini
cube or something like that
the ice oh I'm in trouble cube attack
meaning something mini cube yep cube
attack mini cube and I'm gonna go ahead
and open it up so it's got your USB
ports we've got our sweet green lighting
effects going on there so hopefully you
can see that through the USB ports you
can also see a little bit of ground
effects going on over here
my lav mic is apparently an issue so
there we go I'm gonna turn this around
and show you guys at the back so there's
our there's our lighting inside there is
some seriously hot exhaust coming out of
this system although it's not that loud
here I'll put the lab next to it it's
not something I'd call a silent system
by any stretch of the imagination but
it's not like it sounds like a wind
tunnel either which is what happens
sometimes with these small form-factor
systems and that's what I mean system
builders in particular we're really
excited about when it came to NVIDIA
talking about GTX Titan now that's with
the gk110 GPU so I mean any other
graphics cards such as Tesla's that
shared that gk110 GPU sort of heritage
might be similar so there you go there's
our Titan inside we're gonna go ahead
and flip that up so our lighting goes
all the way around up here that's using
BitFenix alchemy strips we've got our 35
70 K clocked at 4.5 gigahertz with this
nock to a cooler on there cool that's
toasty we've got eight gigs of Kingston
HyperX memory although there's no reason
you couldn't put 16 gigs in there you
certainly got ample cooling for it with
this fan blowing air directly down on
top of it RC sonic power supply our GTX
Titan which takes up the bulk of the
inside of the case you can see it's got
the lighting on there and then we've got
another n F f12 so this is really
important to have that nice high static
pressure directed airflow blowing on the
back of the card four SATA cables go
around to the back where you can have up
to I think we had two SSDs and two hard
drives in it when we did our original
build so just absolute craziness so
there you go guys
are proof that not only can you build a
small form-factor machine with a GTX
Titan but it will actually run and it
will actually overclock to over a
gigahertz as long as you allow it to run
within the power thresholds and
temperature thresholds that we specified
when we did our original review very
very cool and I've had a lot of people
ask me after the original video that we
did in this case where can i buy one of
those the answers I have no idea this
was a sample they shipped it to me I
have no idea whatsoever thank you for
checking out this video on the GTX Titan
in a very small form-factor machine
