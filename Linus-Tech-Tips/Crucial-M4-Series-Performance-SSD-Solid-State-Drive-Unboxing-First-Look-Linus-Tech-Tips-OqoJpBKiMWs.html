SSD right now is a time when SSD pricing
is actually coming down in a fairly
significant way and what that means is
that all of a sudden larger capacity
drives are becoming more attainable it
wasn't that long ago that a 256 gig
drive was gonna cost you for a
performance drive like an m4 in the
neighborhood of 500 to 600 dollars
whereas now we're getting down to that
sort of 300 ish range although for
anyone watching this video in any sort
of period of time from now my numbers
are gonna be completely irrelevant which
by the way is why I don't give you guys
pricing when I'm doing videos or as I
going with that right so higher capacity
drives are becoming far more relevant so
what that means is I'm actually planning
a high capacity that is a 256 gig SSD
roundup so in order to do that I will
need to open up and do some testing on a
crucial m4 256 gig so crucial is
actually a company that I haven't looked
at in terms of SSDs on this channel
before and the reason for that is
honestly it was it was a horror Frick of
hor horrible and horrific and terrible
oversight on my part because crucial
actually make some of the most reliable
SSDs on the market and in terms of their
overall responsibilities as a company
and this seems like sort of a weird
thing for me to comment on but they
really impressed me with this particular
product because with the original
firmware there was ok a there was an
issue but they fixed it really quickly
that caused it to to stop working after
a certain number of time on hours and
they fixed it within like a weekend
which is amazing and then there's the
fact that in the original shipping
firmware it had a certain performance
level that was pretty good and the drive
was selling really well and it was
reliable crucial turned around and
instead of tweaking the firmware and
releasing like an m4 s you know who
would I possibly be you know talking
about their an m4 s they just release it
as a free firmware update for everyone
who owns a crucial m4 already and it
dramatically improved the performance of
the existing product
for every customer who buys it now and
every customer who bought it in the past
so they're not withholding features from
something like a genuine drive that did
never bought trim support in spite of
the fact that it could have been added
they're just adding everything to their
drives right as soon as they can and
treating all of their customers with the
same sort of well treat they treat them
all as customers they all pay for the
drive so anyway there that's my whole
spiel on crucial and like I said these
are some of the most reliable drives
that we carry at NCIX we do have the
numbers and they are there's no real
debate to be had about it this is a SATA
3 6 gigabit per second drive which isn't
actually the most important spec because
while that is a factor for the
sequential reads and writes what it
actually comes down to with SSD
performance is the random performance so
that is what it's doing something how
quickly can it do something else than
something else than something else in
something else all at the same time and
they m4 does admirably well on that it's
not the highest performance drive but it
is a high performance drive it comes in
at a reasonable price and it's very very
reliable plus the company stands behind
it so there's not really much more that
you can ask for from a drive it uses a
Marvell controller and it uses micron
and if you guys don't know this crucial
is sort of the retail arm of micron
which is a much larger company so they
actually manufacture the flash that goes
into the drive so like Intel they're one
of the few drive manufacturers that is
actually producing most of the products
in sign of the end users product that
they eventually receive so like I said I
haven't done the performance evaluation
yet so that's gonna be coming on my NCIX
comm channel this is mostly just an
unboxing and sort of my spiel on sorry
for not doing anything on crucial before
and why I think it's awesome now and
this is a two and a half inch drive oh
that's kind of neat check this out
oh they don't really let you do it well
that's too bad look at this because it's
got the spacer in it like some of the
old Intel drives did but it looks like
they they void the warranty if you take
out the screws remove the spacer and try
to install it in one of the notebooks
that said that's more low profile that's
kind of disappointing see because this
piece of metal this piece of plastic
could be removed completely and the
piece of metal would sit exactly flush
with that although that's very very rare
most notebooks
except a standard to standard
two-and-a-half inch drives you got your
mounting holes on the bottom you've got
your mounting holes on the side and this
is really weird their retail labels on
the bottom of the drive you can tell
from the state of three six gigabit per
second connector as well as the SATA
power cable bizarre right that's
actually at the top of the drive where
you can see the firmware revision is
clearly marked as well as the capacity
and the type of SSD you have
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and don't forget to subscribe
