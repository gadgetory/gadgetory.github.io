actually I don't know if by the time
this comes out it's going to be early at
all but that's not really the point the
point is we are checking out the honor
10 and I absolutely love doing stuff for
honor because I get to make this joke
over and over and over again are you
ready to do the shoot for honor
hey which video are you editing right
now is it the one for Oh No
hey Tyler did that product arrive yet
for honor the one for
so the highlight features of this thing
include an octa-core processor a 19 by 9
aspect ratio screen with knotch
and an NP u or neural processing unit
and it's very very shiny does it look as
good on cameras it doesn't person dang
so we'll start with the obligatory
unboxing you get a sim removal tool you
get a bunch of documentation you get it
oh oh that's actually kind of a nice
touch they include a case so that at
least while you wait for you're like you
know nicer one or whatever you're not
going to get that stupid first scratch
on the phone that you're you're
otherwise likely to it actually includes
a screen protector as well so those
kinds of things are always a nice touch
we've got a supercharged power supply
right here with oops
well I'm sure you'll get one that's
compatible with your region and a USB
type-c cable with an adorable purple
inset of course it's no big secret but I
think unboxings are boring so let's have
a look at the phone itself I've actually
got a couple of them I've got that sick
purple and blue iridescent they call it
a roar a gradient or something like that
finish and then I've got a more plain
blue one that quite frankly you should
be able to tell by now but I think this
one looks so much better looking at the
physical layout of the phone there are a
couple of things that I think some folks
are going to find polarizing like it's
really the age of phablets these days
but this is a comfortably one handable
phone like you can actually type well at
least if you got SwiftKey on anyway that
comes pre-loaded which is nice with one
hand on it but I don't know if everyone
is gonna like the duplicated home button
so you've got a software one as well as
a built in one in hardware and that's
actually where the fingerprint sensor is
so it boxed the trend in terms of
fingerprint sensor it bucks the trend in
terms of headphone jack which for me
anyway is a really nice inclusion and
then it sticks with the
for the display knotch I'm happy to see
a more handle balapan though and
personally I'm a really big fan of glass
backs because even though actually this
one I think I've already got some
fingerprints on even though they do tend
to get fingerprinted up pretty easily
what's nice about the glass it's not at
least they're easy to clean then they're
perfect another choice they made that's
gonna be controversial no matter how you
slice it is their use of an IPS display
so right now the main two choices are
OLED or LCD IPS and they've both got
pros and cons with OLED having perfect
blacks and the ability to you know show
the time even when the screen is off for
example with IPS having the advantage of
basically no chance of running into
burnin issues so it's a good IPS they're
boasting 96% coverage of ntsc and it
looks after i turned off the vivid
profile that was loaded by default
subjectively really freakin good but
everyone's gonna have their own feelings
on a decision like this now this is
something really interesting that i
picked up on the way that they've
implemented the knotch is not like pure
knotch
or pure not knotch so you can see that
the display stretches up into the notch
area when you're vertical but check this
out it actually does a little trickery
thing so you watch that change too
curved and then it cuts the notch out
when you put video in landscape mode
which personally I think is a really
nice touch another thing that you can
actually do while I'm on the subject of
cool little software tricks is you can
turn the notch off entirely and there
are actually some nice touches as well
wireless charging isn't supported but it
does support four and a half amp 5 volt
fast charging and their facial
recognition it is shockingly fast so
I've got it open here it's looking for
my face BAM
that's really impressive and this one's
cool there's a feature on here called
smart rotate that lets the screen
rotation follow the direction of your
face
can your phone do this and it's these in
portrait mode cool right anyway the big
feature on the phone is really on the
rear shooter so it's a dual rear shooter
it's got a 16 megapixel F 1.8 color
sensor and then a 24 megapixel
black-and-white and the whole thing is
powered by their neural processing unit
or npu so using their npu they can
actually recognize the subject of a
photo and then adjust the way that it
looks in order to make it more pleasing
let's go try it out on a few things
shall we alright so let's do some test
shots with the AI camera first let's do
with no AI hi James I'm trying to do you
a service here by taking a good picture
of you not easy now let's turn on AI
photography and it has identified that
this is a person and it looks like it
went and applied a background blur
effect so that's an interesting thing
for it to do on its own let's try some
food that is not very photogenic food
but I'm sure it tastes good look at that
it identified food thought it was person
for a second alright a car should be a
pretty easy one yep wow that did not
take long the instant I turned on AI it
was like yep that's a car let's find
some nature bang nature you pretty
yep I get a little flower icon so I want
to talk about what an NP you actually
does well we have a look at the shots
from the AI versus non AI photo
comparison here subjectively I like a
more natural look to my photos so I
would probably have it off in many cases
but the underlying technology here is
really the big story to me we've been at
the point for a while now where a phone
CPU can be expected to do all of the
normal stuff that you'd want from it
really well you know run the UI smoothly
I'll bring up your apps list
open apps whatever the case may be
without a ton of perceptible leg so what
an NP you does is it is a specialized
processor actually get dedicated silicon
that is designed for convoluted neural
networks so this doesn't mean that all
of a sudden you can just turn on AI mode
and run around in the world with you
know pointing your phone's camera at
things and it's just gonna start to have
a broad understanding of the world but
what it does mean is that a neural
network model one that would have to be
trained by a very powerful computer
probably in a data center somewhere can
be more easily understood using this
kind of client-side neural networking
technology so the powerful server trains
the model creates a simplified version
of it that honor will push to your phone
with an update and then your NPU does
what's called inferencing in order to
feed that model some new piece of data
like you're pointing your phone at a cat
and then infer what it's supposed to be
from the model that it has downloaded so
at this point the NPU is being used
primarily to monitor usage patterns and
then optimize the processors use of
power so that you'll get as much battery
life as possible out of the phone and to
recognize photography subjects with the
camera and then adjust the camera
settings accordingly so calling it AI is
a little bit optimistic it's not like
it's got like Jarvis built into your
phone or anything like that so right now
it has the ability to recognize an
animal or a pet but new models that
honor could push via updates could give
it the capability of being able to tell
the difference between a cat and a dog
and a possum that one's unlikely but
like a possum for example meaning that
it can in fact get smarter over time
even if the actual training doesn't take
place on the device itself so that's
pretty much my rundown of the honor 10
