completely new location that you
obviously won't recognize because it's
completely new this is another room in
my eye my new house where I'd set up
some lights and I've got a little table
I'm sitting on the floor it's pretty
good for the moment but it'll improve
anyway today I'm going to be unboxing
the cone gauge or coach age arrow this
is a cpu cooler and it is from the
company that i had actually never heard
of until they approached me about doing
an unboxing and product showcase of Dara
their arrow cooler now basically it's
kind of like an offshoot of thermal
right as far as I can tell and so that's
kind of like what what an a swap used to
be to Anna Seuss but that's different
now either way why don't we have a look
at the basic specs of this guy to start
with so I'm going to get the camera
remote then to zoom in on the box here
so it has support for socket 1366 socket
1156 as well as socket 775 and it
doesn't say anything about support for
oh yeah there it is on the side okay so
there's going to be a little bit more
information on the side I'm going to
zoom in even further I hate not having a
camera person's brutal okay hmm so here
on the side you can see it has four
eight millimeter large centers heat
pipes so those are nice big heat pipes
on their next thing nickel plated basin
heat pipes improves the wooden geminii
of the heatsink by slowing oxidation
okay i'm not sure if it improves the
longevity but what it does do is it
improves the appearance over time
because oxidized copper looks horrible
okay you've got a double fin stack
design provides each are impressive
surface area special arrow thin design
and we'll have a look at that in a
minute soldered heat pipes and copper
basin sure all components maintain the
highest level of thermal efficiency all
right support for multiple platforms so
am too am three are optional then it
includes a quiet 120-millimeter fan and
capable of supporting up to three fans
for the ultimate enthusiast thirty eight
millimeter fan will fit between the two
towers if that's pretty cool you got
your dimensions here and a big one for
coolers is always the weight this is an
eight hundred and twenty-five grand who
so that's almost two pounds so you can
expect this to be a pretty big guy then
you've got pure copper with nickel
plating gen compatibility okay that
pretty much takes care of the outside of
the box so why don't we start getting
this thing opened up here I'm going to
just kind of do that a little bit and
that should be good enough all right
let's get it opened up here so the first
thing we will find inside is a black box
okay not at all like the one on an
airplane much more different black box
thermalright used to never care about
like packaging that you can see that
with this koj gyorko gauge bread and
actually with some other more recent
thermalright products we've actually got
like a nice-looking retail box and then
they're using black cardboard for the
insides instead of just plain jane brown
cardboard I mean packaging is important
whether you like it or not it is so why
don't we figure out how to open this box
and then we'll go from there aha just
like this unless I'm mistaken which I
could be but I only have one tape to
foodies unboxing so I'm just gonna have
to roll with it ah you know what I think
I might've I think i mighta been right
here you go once you've opened that up
all the accessories just kind of fall
out here so yeah let's have a look at
everything that's included with the
arrow first thing I find is the
important before okay so we have two
copies of this and they both appear to
be English um okay so we have a separate
instruction booklet for eleven fifty six
versus four 1366 and I'm trying to
figure out why that would be I'll let
you try and figure it out with me here
if you can look at the front because it
looks like the instructions are actually
the same I mean obviously the back
plates are going to be different sizes
the hold downs are going to be slightly
different sizes but the included
component list is also the same so I'm
going to open these up and
just kind of stare at it myself and see
if I can figure out some way that these
instructions differ from each other I
guess I can also be what I'll do is I'll
hold this one up for you all to look at
while I look at this one and then I'll
talk about all the steps so it's an
eight-step process to install this
particular cooler you put the backplate
on you click the hole there you put the
brackets on top of the motherboard to
put some thermal paste on then you put
the hold down onto the heatsink install
anti-vibration strips on a fan install
the fan clips and install the fan oh
this is a cool feature you can actually
install either a 120-millimeter or a 1
40 millimeter fan which you can see in
this last frame right here so that's
pretty neat alright so why don't we have
a look at the actual hold downs here so
this appears to be one of them and this
appears to be the other one so the 1156
fold down is also 775 compatible
according to the instructions although I
don't see how that's really possible how
does that work ok well you know what
they say it works i'm going to go ahead
and press them on this one ok so we've
got two sets of back plates hold downs
and then brackets and then oh yeah I see
it now so the 7751 the whole town is a
little bit wider so now you can either
go on a 775 or it on 56 and then this is
sort of the more interesting guy because
there's actually different stuff in here
although I can't figure out how to get
it open why don't we do this I'm not
gonna just throw my table here ok so we
have these little anti-vibration rubber
strips I have one to three sets of those
so like they said up to three fans
alright then we have how many sets of
fan pics so we have to kind of thicker
thicker looking ones two sets of those i
should say for total and then we have a
two that are kind of thinner and flimsy
or looking and I'm guessing they're
different sizes based on looking at them
initially and
no they're not they're all for 120
millimeters so I'm guessing one of the
maps to a different spot on the cooler
we've got some thermal paste and then
we've got an included little wrench guy
here so that's for tough this is great
that's for securing this particular
screw so you know what that is worth
zooming in on so I'm just going to bring
you all the way in you can check this
out so when you're putting the screw and
you can actually use the little wrench
or you could just use a screwdriver like
a normal human being and that would also
be quite effective so let's get all of
this so I'm going to clear it away off
to the side and then I can tackle the
cooler itself because we've been
recording for a while now here without
actually even looking at the cooler uh
no more accessories right I forgot
there's a fan oh that's kind of nice
looking okay so it's got like a black
outer shell and it's kind of a shiny
shiny black and then the blades are kind
of a striking yellow color which seems
like something that wouldn't look very
nice but in person is actually pretty is
pretty good it's pretty good looking it
looks kind of like the Gaelic wings so
i'm going to i'm wondering if the hub
comes off looks like it doesn't so i'm
guessing it is not using exactly the
same design as the gelug wing I don't
know what kind of a bearing it uses but
it spins it anywhere from 1,000 to 1800
rpm depending on the input voltage all
right that gives you some idea what's
going on with the fan and then let's
figure out oh oh I'm in trouble I'm in
trouble I have no I have no knife and
I'm encountering zip ties here also I
have one more set of installation
instructions and this is for 775 so i'm
guessing battle l I'm the difference in
the installation between 11
six and seven seven five all right here
we go so let's see if I can figure out
some way to detach these I may just have
to cut this clip off in the middle here
because that is attached really really
well one of these days I'll learn to
keep a knife in a pair of scissors handy
for my unboxings but until then I might
just have to interrupt videos in the
middle some time to time to go get one
it doesn't happen that often so yeah I
might just never learn okay there we go
so I've actually managed to remove the
arrow from the box at this point and
this is one huge cooler okay so I guess
what can I easily use for scale I guess
I'll use my hand for scale and I'll zoom
in a little bit here for you because
you're going to want to see this thing
up a little bit closer alright so as the
outside of the box mentioned you've got
four heat pipes these are absolutely
enormous heat pipes I mean you can look
at them compared to the width of a
finger they are just huge eight
millimeter heat pipes and those go down
to the base of the unit care so you can
see that it is not a heat pipe direct
touch heatsink although it's debatable
whether or not that actually matters the
engineering of the heat sink itself
seems to be far more important I'll do
the obligatory finger shot so you can
see the base of the unit is quite shiny
and I can't feel any machining grooves
in the bottom of it so they've done
quite a nice job of finishing the base
of this particular heatsink now the
bottom piece I don't know if you can see
that or not is soldered together so you
should have pretty good contact there in
terms of your thermals and then you know
what this is something that obviously co
gauge because it's a sister company of
thermal right has borrowed from thermal
right and you can see that the leading
edge of these fins is actually ok I
don't know how I'm going to illustrate
this but the leading edge of these fins
out here we go you can see it more from
the side is actually slanted down and
then the trailing edge is actually
slanted up and they do the same thing on
each one where they they are improving
the turbulence of the air flow through
the heat sink and they're trying to make
better use of the air that moves through
these fins by
causing it to change direction and make
more contact with the actual metal of
the of the fins that are attached to the
heat pipe so that's what they're going
ahead and doing there and you know what
I'm going to just take a brief moment
here and I'm going to grab the fan and
show you sort of all the different
places that can mount so the mounting
system is actually pretty
straightforward it's a something we've
seen a lot of times before so you got a
couple bowls up in the top of the of the
unit so they're here here here here here
here here and here do you use the little
fan clips which are handily included in
ample quantity for you you run those
three little holes and then you click
them on to the fan so I'm not going to
bother doing that on camera but this is
what it will look like with a fan here
okay this is what it will look like with
the fan in the middle so basically you
can't see the fun at all and remember to
the middle is actually quite a bit too
big for a 25 millimeter fan and they've
done that on purpose so you can actually
install your own thirty eight millimeter
thick then if you want this particular
cooler i think that's about all there is
to say about it so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the co gauge
arrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
