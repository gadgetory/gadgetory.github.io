so the good thing about flying in a
plane from the 70s it hasn't fallen
apart yet legend has it that in 1978
MIT professor dr. Aman
was on a transatlantic flight from
Switzerland when the flight attendant
offered him a pair of headphones
shortly afterward as the story goes the
plane was so noisy that Bose could
hardly hear the inflate music at all so
he fetched a pen and a napkin and began
jotting down the first mathematical
calculations for how to remove airplane
noise from his listening experience
fast forward 22 years and boasts
released the first active
noise-cancelling headphones for
consumers followed 18 years later on
this installment of why advertising
friendly content are you guys buying
this the quiet comfort 25 which somehow
are still the best selling headphones on
amazon.com along with like these other
super cheap ones so let's see then what
makes these things so bloody special
thermal takes level 20 cases feature
gaming focused aesthetics on radiator
mounting for water cooling and beautiful
tempered glass panels check them out at
the link below
noise cancelling headphones work by
incorporating a microphone or in this
case microphones uh in each ear cup on
the inside by the users here and on the
outside to measure ambient sound they
take that ambient sound measurement and
they compare it to the desired signal
coming from your device and then they
generate a new waveform that's exactly
equal but opposite to the noise coming
in destroying the unwanted waves by way
of destructive interference so as you
can imagine this technology works better
on frequencies that are consistent which
is why noise cancelling headphones are
awesome at filtering out noise from
airplane engines or HVAC systems but not
so great when it comes to crying babies
and annoying coworkers since the year
2000 release of the original quiet
comfort acoustic noise-canceling
headphones now known as the QC ones Bose
has released a new set in the lineup at
least every three years including the
Google assistant equipped QC 35 series
twos that launched in late 2017 for 350
dollars pretty pricey and out of reach
for a lot of people now the best-selling
headphones on Amazon and therefore the
true subject of this video are these QC
25 originally from 2014 they only cost
about a hundred and eighty bucks on
Amazon today if you go for the Apple
version with the version for Android
devices being twenty dollars more for
some reason but the only difference is
the functionality of the inline controls
so we grabbed the Apple version and gave
it a shot on an Android phone
turns out we were actually still able to
play and pause our music and even skip
tracks but there was no volume control
and when we tried to use it to hang up a
phone call music started playing instead
so if that stuff matters to you then you
should either pay the extra $30 or try
your luck on a cheaper third-party cable
but then hold on a second
as evidenced by my almost entirely faded
eyebrow ring scar it is not the year
2000 anymore there are actually a bunch
of noise cancelling alternatives to Bose
like the super popular cow any sevens
that are a fraction of the price
so how is a $200 product
still on top when every other product in
this appetizer series has been budget AF
well it's because low price doesn't mean
high value and people purchase products
in order to get a job done whether
that's a soundbar whose job is to make
dialogue easier to hear a tablet whose
job is to play netflix in bed and not be
destroyed by your kids or a 4k smart tv
whose job is to be 4k and a TV that's
like maybe smart or something so then
what's the job to get done with noise
cancelling headphones may be comfortable
airline travel or productivity at your
desk well that means that automatically
Bose is targeting a more affluent
clientele people with jobs or who travel
regularly and the bottom line is that
the qc25 s are really good at their job
something that is worth paying a little
extra for not only do they offer
category leading noise cancellation they
are also really comfortable for hours at
a time and they're super portable thanks
to their folding headband and
lightweight rugged carrying case after
all that the fact that they punch way
above their weight in terms of sound
quality is almost just a bonus
now that's the frenzy value that we
expect in this series or at least that's
what I would be saying if the three top
rated customer reviews for this product
weren't all one-star now if you sell
enough headphones you're bound to get a
bad review or two but it's become enough
of a pattern that it appears as though
Bose has been scrimping on the materials
lately a lot of these things seem to
struggle to last longer than a year to a
year and a half so if you're not into
that sort of thing maybe you should save
your money after all especially
considering that the best selling
headphones in the on air and the in-ear
categories are both super cheap the most
popular honors are actually these the
new K 11s I can't quite figure out why
but I do have at least a theory so
they're marketed towards kids with
bright colors a durable braided cable
and a parent friendly price of just 15
dollars but there's a lot of headphones
for kids out there what makes these one
stand out I think is the fact that
they're used
for parents too so the headband expands
from child size to absolute melon the
sound quality isn't complete trash and
they go loud which is unusual since a
lot of kids cans have volume limiters on
them for safety I mean who needs safety
when you got convenience right the
suckiest thing about these as far as I
can tell is the fit so the ear cups
don't articulate which means that at
least with the pair we've got and on my
head they don't quite sit flush against
my ears so they don't seal particularly
well you won't have to worry about that
though with the best-selling IEMs the
Panasonic Peugeot fit earbuds for under
$10 of the 54,000 reviews of these
things 82% of people gave them a 4 or 5
because they fit well
they sound decent and they can last for
years and years I might explain how
they've been around since at least 2012
look at this the box still says iPod on
it they'll still exist from that but
anyway if your phone still has a
headphone jack there's really no reason
not to check out any one of the three
