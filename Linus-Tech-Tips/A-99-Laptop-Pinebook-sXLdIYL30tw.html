laptop then sort by price lowest highest
the cheapest option is a hundred and
forty six dollars then if you go that's
not low enough and you fire up
Aliexpress it's about a hundred and
twenty seven us but what if I told you
that you can get a fully functional
laptop for just 99 US dollars you might
say to me gee Linus surely there's some
kind of catch and you'd be one smart
shopper because while this thing is
truly a fully functional laptop for 99
dollars
it's got one heck of a gotcha let's take
a look at it shall we
after we take a look at this message
from our sponsor Atlanta audio online
audios new mod mic Wireless features a
low latency connection high quality
sampler 8 led status indicators up to 12
hours of battery life and more check it
out at the link in the video description
so this is the pine book it comes from
the single board computer company pine
sixty-four and on first glance looks
like basically every other you know
macbook design ripoff
from 2008 it comes in a couple of
flavors so ours is the 11.6 inch version
that comes with an IPS display and then
there's a separate 14 inch version
that's got a TN panel instead what's
nice about the 14 inch version is that
it does have a bigger trackpad thinner
bezels and pretty much a full size 10
keyless keyboard while this one is
actually quite squished so it's got a
short backspace button it's got these
Pinner little arrow keys you'd probably
get used to that what you won't get used
to is the shifts now this one I think
this short left shift is actually
standard somewhere but this one how are
you supposed to get used to that overall
the the feel of the keyboard is actually
surprisingly good like I've seen laptops
that cost three four five times this
much that have more flex to their
keyboard overall so I'm there is some to
be clear but it's really not that bad
the thing weighs about a kilogram and
then it's got a point three megapixel
camera up here at the top io is actually
pretty reasonable for 2019 standards
microSD expansion headphone microphone
combo 3 1/2 millimeter jack USB type-a
which is nice to have another one of
those DC inputs so no USB type-c come on
guys and then due to the low profile of
the machine we're stuck with a mini HDMI
which in fairness gives us HDMI output
which is good but is very likely to
break this is really not a very robust
connector in terms of the internal specs
should we should we open this thing up
let's have a look at it let's do that
and there it is
Oh
a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core arm cortex a53
64-bit processor 2 gigabytes of lpddr3
RAM 16 gigs of emmc memory I'm just kind
of pointing vaguely at this small board
because it's it's it's all on here and
then we've got wireless n with Bluetooth
4.0 and you can see your antennas are
hooked up over here also of note is our
spectacular stereo speakers and oh yeah
look in this you can kind of see
everything in here so here's our magnet
for the top cover to keep it closed
there's your microphones does have dual
microphones so like an array microphone
and off for play though let's find out
just how much laptop you get for 99
bucks you're second now that we're
booted we're looking at a KDE neon Linux
desktop we see that there's actually no
5 gigahertz Wi-Fi support so just 2.4
gigahertz that's kind of to be expected
on something this low spec we can't I'm
gonna come in a little closer okay whoo
web page loading time is not spectacular
it's hard to say how much of the slow
experience for having right now is
software and how much is hardware though
because the pine 64 guys acknowledge
that this build of KDE neon is quite out
of date like it's got tons of issues
like the fact that it takes forever to
move the cursor across the screen you
can't adjust the display brightness but
then on the other hand the CPU and this
thing has a MIPS core of about around
11,000 which puts it somewhere in the
neighborhood of Sony's PlayStation 3 in
terms of performance with the GPU it's
actually a Mallee 400 MP 2 which gives
it about the performance of the original
Xbox so I'm not even were you expecting
this James I'm not even able to load
youtube.com/ fortunately our journey
doesn't end here though because the good
folks at Manjaro have a specific
build of their OS that you can load up
using etcher on a micro SD card and
boots of that instead which I think we
should probably do right about now
that's still slow yes yes it is so now
that we're in let's see if our
brightness adjustment works now
hey all right so this is already a
better experience but with the better
trackpad and the brighter display let's
see if YouTube even manages to load at
all okay this is a lot better but I
think the question that we need to
answer now is okay let's say that I'm
willing to learn to use Linux is this
usable so I'm gonna get logged into my
gmail maybe get some Libre Office on
here try and watch some YouTube videos
let's see volume out a hundred percent I
can't hear it at all okay so this is
weird after some dinking around in the
audio settings we found that we can
change our maximum volume to a hundred
and fifty percent so why don't we try
that first nothing we can change hey wow
that's really quiet
okay so a couple problems the fact that
it was configured to use the wrong audio
device out of the box not the end of the
world that's the kind of thing that you
can fix pretty quickly but it's got some
other issues so it does technically have
stereo speakers but it figures this is
the front right speaker and this is the
front left speaker you can actually hear
it coming out of this one my press issue
number two is that at a hundred percent
volume in both the application and the
device it's way too quiet and if we
crank it to a hundred and fifty percent
well it sounds like this
in fairness to it though if I was using
headphones the YouTube playback is
actually pretty reasonable although we
aren't at HD yet so let's try 720p we
are dropping a lot of frames here ok
let's go back to 480p even 480p in full
screen mode chugs if your objective is
purely just to watch youtube videos and
absorb the information you can do it
let's fire up email or something then
I'm not gonna lie guys this is not a
great experience even just performing a
search in Gmail so I just clicked an
email let's give her a hot second here
so this is like a cached page let's go
back so at this point I think it's
pretty clear that the hardware in here
is not really daily driver ready and by
the way if you were thinking oh well
maybe I could just play like ancient
games on it or something
unfortunately because it's got a Mallee
GPU and the Mallee drivers are not
open-source well 3d accelerations pretty
much not available on any arch based
images like Manjaro the lima drivers are
like a reverse engineered driver but
they're not complete so you could
install them on the pine book but you'd
have to recompile the kernel first and
it frankly would not be a good
experience at all anyway it's not
something that we'd recommend our final
project for this is to actually try to
install windows now as we mentioned
before this is an ARM based cpu but
Microsoft has been working on arm
versions of Windows for over half a
decade now remember the surface RT has a
long time ago so we're gonna give it a
shot maybe see if Windows can save this
experience
so to do this and this is our first
attempt at this actually this is the one
thing we didn't prep before the video we
used a tool called the windows on arm
deployer and an image that's actually
intended for use with the Raspberry Pi
which is also ARM based but isn't a pine
book so we're really not sure if this is
gonna work only one way to find out so
what we're trying to do right now is
figure out how to get it to boot to this
because when we threw mine djaro on a
micro SD it just automatically booted to
it but now it's not doing that
I tried F - I tried f8 I try to have 10
I actually f11 f11 makes an appearance
once in a while let's try delete come on
baby try f1 it help
given how utterly unsuitable this is for
daily driver use and the fact that our
initial attempts to install a Raspberry
Pi build of windows didn't work we
decided to abandon it because the
reality of it is pine sixty-four
flat-out says what this is not for this
is not a device to use as your current
work or school laptop and if that's what
you're after you probably need to look
elsewhere what it's really intended for
is as a low cost all-in-one solution for
armed Linux and BSD developers that are
looking to mainline the SOC or are
interested in some part of it like the
GPU for example one example is the Lima
project so that's not to say that
there's no potential for something like
this to achieve low-cost daily driver
status in the future in fact the
upcoming pine Book Pro could be a better
daily driver it's going to be 200 rather
than 100 dollars it's based on the RK
$33.99 so at the hexa core SOC six cores
with to a 72 s at two gigahertz four
gigs of ram instead of two 14 inch IPS
panel magnesium alloy body instead of
the plastic one USBC so in summary this
thing isn't what we hoped it was and
that shouldn't be a surprise because
they told us that it wasn't what we
hoped it was but if you clicked into
this and you're disappointed now because
you were like oh I was really kind of
hoping for a $100 laptop option we did
manage to find a couple other things
that look a bit more compelling so this
cheap Windows machine over on Walmart is
just a hundred and forty bucks it's got
a touchscreen it's a convertible
and it's only got 32 gigs of storage so
it's likely that Windows Update will
eventually be the death of it but it
does look fairly usable for the price
and this Chromebook over on new egg is a
bit more expensive it's over $200 and
it's a Chromebook so you're gonna have
software limitations finally the third
option as we always love to bring up
anytime someone's on a budget is picking
up something used a lot of the time you
can get a used laptop somewhere like
eBay or Craigslist or Kijiji let go
wherever for much cheaper than you could
get
something new especially if you're
looking at Windows machines or
Chromebooks as opposed to a MacBook or
something those things hold their value
incredibly well hide your true IP
address with private Internet access

Internet kill switch if your VPN gets
disconnected accidentally it prevents
DNS leaks and it includes Mase P IAS
built-in malware blocker P ia offers
various levels of encryption that can be
