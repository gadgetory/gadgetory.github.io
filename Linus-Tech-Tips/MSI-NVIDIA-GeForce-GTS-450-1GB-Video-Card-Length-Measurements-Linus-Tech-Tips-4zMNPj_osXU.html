the length of the GTS 450 this is a
cyclone one gig GTS 450 and as I said
before this is gonna be a quick video
because there's not a whole lot to say
it is 21 centimeters long and for my
American friends we will also view my
channel it is 8 point hold on let's get
that lined up eight and a quarter inches
long that is how long the GTS 450 is so
if you wanted to measure from the PCI
Plate in your case to the back of the
cart then that would give you a fairly
representative idea but but wait there's
more hold on
actually where's my where's my stupid
adapter I had a six pin adapter around
here somewhere oh I think I'm actually
using it on my test bench right now okay
hold on hold on we're gonna find a way
to make this work I'll be back in the
okay I found a modular cable from
another power supplier that I have lying
around so okay when you're measuring the
space that the car takes up just bear in
mind that even though it's eight and a
quarter inches 20 and I forget 21
centimeters long at the top of the card
you may need a little bit more space so
you see up here when you've actually got
the six pin power connector plugged in
with cable Bend even if you're bending
it at a pretty tight radius you're
probably gonna need about 25 centimeters
of space just at that one point up here
at the top of the card so bear that in
mind if your hard drive cages are like
right up against the card that power
connector is gonna be a bit of a bear to
deal with so there that is my video on
the length of the GTS 450 this is the
cyclone one gig Edition from MSI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
