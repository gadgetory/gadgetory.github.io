XP you d3p from gigabyte this is a very
value oriented motherboard in terms of
the price but a very performance and the
looks and just generally awesome
oriented motherboard when you have a
look at the features that are included
which are all of the z68 features and
let's go through them so the first one
is easy Smart Response which is a
gigabyte exclusive patent-pending
Asterix Asterix cltd whatever the case
may be basically what that means is it
is a really easy way to use Intel SRT or
Smart Response technology which allows
you to take a large affordable hard
drive and cache it improve the
performance of it with a small
affordable SSD it works really well
everyone who can't afford an SSD for
their system because the capacity that
they need is just like oh well then I
can't afford that capacity I just won't
get one do this instead touch BIOS so
hybrid EFI technology allows three
terabyte plus hard drives
ok 60% ok yeah yeah ready for Intel's
next gen 22 nanometer CPUs very cool
okay so that's Ivy Bridge ready for
native PCI Express gen3 so upcoming
graphics cards that won't be around for
a while but there you go supports it
driver MOSFETs three times USB power
which is a great feature allows you to
charge more devices or power more
devices through a hub 12 phase power
design on the board itself and here's
all those e68 features so Intel HD
graphics if you don't want to put in a
dedicated graphics card quick sync which
allows you to use the dedicated graphics
and an integrated graphics card in order
to get great gaming performance and
great video encoding performance lucid
virtu that's the switchable graphics
that allows you to do that and support
for intel's k series overclocking let me
see if I'm missing anything else on this
very complicated and full looking box I
don't think so so let's have a look at
what's included we've got an HDMI to DVI
adapter these are handy we have an i/o
shield which is helpfully color-coded
aha
flexible black SLI bridge my very
favorite kind we have four SATA cables
so to our right angle and two of them
are straight we have a user's manual
including a driver DVD don't use this
download the latest from the gigabyte
website as well as a guide for Smart
Response technology which you probably
won't need a guide for because it's so
easy with the gigabyte utility
multilingual installation guidebook I
actually have a video about that on my
NCIX comm channel so you can feel free
to check that out and I show you how to
install SRT technology using the
gigabyte utility which is basically you
download the exe to your desktop and
then you run it yeah really it's that
easy although I have had people ask me
so do you install the OS initially to
the hard drive and the answer is yes you
do and then you add the SSD later
alright so let's look at the layout of
the board overall it's a very slick
looking all blackboard so we've got
almost nothing on here that's not black
or white or silver or Chrome or some
sort of shade in between we've got yeah
no that's white we've got a little blue
accents on some of the capacitors but
look how nice that looks guys alright so
there's our LGA 1155 socket compatible
at the latest core i3 Core i5 and core
i7 CPUs we've got a nice beefy power
design which I do not expect to see
normally on a UD 3 class board this is
more like what I'd expect to see on a UD
4 or UD 5 class aboard but gigabytes
really gone all out on this one we've
got our 8 pin power connector in its
ideal location and the top left I'll go
through fan headers later we've got
pretty beefy looking cooling but they
are attached by plastic pegs so be a
little bit careful with those when
you're taking them out of the box just
make sure you got good contact between
the MOSFETs and the heat sinks and then
you shouldn't have too much to worry
about we've got four ddr3 dimms slots
supporting dual channel memory we've got
our 24-pin connector in its ideal
location along the right-hand edge
gigabyte SATA ports are right here so
those are powered by a third-party
chipset if you're running SATA 3 drives
I would highly recommend you stick with
the two Intel powered ones which are
right here and then you've also got 4
SATA 2 connectors to go along with those
so total of 8 SATA connectors our
chipset heatsink is right here nice and
low profile so you're not going to have
any problems with graphics cards being
interfered with we've got our front
panel connector our TPM we've got front
USB 3 right about here
front high powered USB - so that's for
charging your iPad or other tablet with
the included utility one two more front
panel USB 2 ports we've got front
firewire front audio and then we've got
what looks like a fairly ideal setup so
three PCIe 1x of which two of them will
be available when you install a dual
slot graphics card to PCI of which one
will be available when you install a
dual slot graphics card so that gives
you room for one two three more devices
in addition to your SLI or crossfire
graphics cards and you can have one PCI
and two PCIe 1x on the back of the board
we find almost nothing except you can
see that that chips that you think may
be due to its size is affixed by screws
so that's nice to see on the back we've
got one two three four five six seven
eight USB 2.0 ports one of those ps2
mouse keyboard combo ports optical audio
out HDMI out that is what gives you the
ability to use lucid virtu and Intel
Quick Sync technology and then we've got
two USB 3.0 ports Gigabit Ethernet and
7.1 audio out don't forget also you know
what I think they even mention this on
the box I can't believe they didn't
mention that what's being here somewhere
yeah there it is
okay dual BIOS yeah don't forget about
dual BIOS dual BIOS is awesome because
it means that if your BIOS gets pooched
you can actually restore to the other
BIOS chip no problem so that's a very
convenient feature makes it so that you
are less likely to brick a gigabyte
board with a BIOS flash than anything
that doesn't have dual BIOS thank you
