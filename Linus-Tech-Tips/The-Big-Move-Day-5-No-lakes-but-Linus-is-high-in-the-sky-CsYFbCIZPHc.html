getting down to the really awful stuff
that you could you know you kind of been
putting off until now so this is
inventory that we moved like three
months ago so it was sitting here
throughout framing drywalling oh it's
thick it has actual thickness on my
finger so we're going to finish that off
today the goal is to finish inventory
today and there's also a secret goal
that I like a bonus objective everything
south of that wall needs to move so that
we can clean this floor and then we can
move inventory stuff over here so we can
clean that side so we want to get this
side clear today they're going to take
away that bin today so uh yeah wish us
luck
Intel's bringing ddr4 to the mainstream
with their all-new core i7 6700 K and
Core i5 6600 K processors check out the
link in the video description to learn
more I think it's the electrical
inspector is actually here so we are
getting very close they still have the
wrong toilet up there but now there's
really not much else to show in here
other than that it's pretty much there
yeah I suppose every guy sorry server
the server died what whoa why did it
turn off okay for some reason the server
just turned off I do not know why right
now it's not super hot in here or
anything so I don't think it's
that is really really bad news oh this
is a french-canadian keyboard look how
awful it is
look at this shift key look at this
Enter key
what is the delete here did it just turn
off again whoa whoa his other stuff off
are they oh they're doing the electrical
inspection Oh a bunch of other stuff
just turned off Oh balls
wait so they're messing with the
breakers yeah and the reason it only
took out the one machine these
individual outlets are each on its
separate breakers well that would be by
the server went down problems all no no
it's still happening
so not solved fortunately we have those
battery backups on our rate cards okay
so over here in fricking stand building
land these damn things are like a
millimeter off some of them are off by
like maybe like a couple millimeters so
when you're setting the whole thing up
you can't really tell and then it's like
skewed so like torqued around yeah so we
have to go through every one of these
that we have and put all the same size
together there's a system everything
large at the bottom I think it's almost
all done except for like knickknacks and
like things I'd still don't have because
we're missing that fast okay if I just I
love the feeling of not knowing where
something like as $700 or more is there
we go service back up yeah they're
taking it away they're taking away the
yellow bin Oh someone put pellets
against the wall
how hard are they to take out just got
an update from Luke apparently all the
copper is off the whole room room so
there you go we're on a really efficient
way to do it just an ax plate bender
from Futurama and we went down awesome
fantastic all right that is that's great
news so will you guys be here maybe in
the next hour or so we have to do the
island okay take all the walls and bring
up the carpet okay so basically we'll be
lucky if he's here in time for when Cho
I'm assuming a bike tire repair kit
belongs to you and that's actually not
mine but I will take it
always wrap your fuzzies ladies and
gentlemen that's actually surprisingly
important are these your mints no I
didn't think so cuz you've probably
never used a breath mint like measure
twice assemble once yeah these are
Genesis resident man ID how are you
actually your HUD or Taiwan whore that's
all gender hacker just nothing beyond
how even when you'll be on to muhabba
the first person to put a hole in the
wall gets a hole in them
ah this is the hardest part of inventory
because all these items need to be
catalogued individually but then we
group them so okay so John yeah I have
two these are black magic okay and the
part number is nine nine five five five
nine gtx 560 TI unicorn fecal matter
okay the horns are valuable single
single through sixty double double 360
triple ahh that's actually better than I
thought it would look it is but the
lighting is wrong it is it's different
so we're gonna pretend to be in the
kitchen for a long time yet I guess
check out all the flies on the coach
okay guys so I if you've got any more
garbage please please please give it to
me or throw it out if you leave it
overnight we're gonna have an
infestation of flies and I'm pretty sure
that's how you get ants we finally found
the refill for the label maker it was in
this bin of dry erase markers felt to
set up when show only got an hour and
fifty minutes so as you can see when you
don't throw away oh no your stuff oh
dear Robert Lee you tend to get the
winged ants barflies enough whatever
that's uh that's a concern actually it's
a lot better okay so we have to get at
an access point that's way up at the top
right for some reason I can't bring up
the the web UI for it so I have to
physically reset them
that's why is it way up there you have
two lips there's a button to reset why
is it all the way up there because win
here I told you not to put them up there
well where else am I gonna put okay hold
on we're through the door that is way
Wi-Fi coverage pretty much the whole
warehouse thanks to its subs a dozen
well let's bail except it's not working
yes what's it doing you there's like
it's just a mechanical thing you just
pull it out oh yeah baby
enjoy watch out that you're getting it
down there you're good there oh there
you go that's not so bad
okay that's not so bad

okay so I'm not freaking out I forgot a
pen you once did you reset it I guess I
have resented this is actually kind of
freaky it's ways way more than I would
like okay now I can come down so now I
have to reverse out all right let's do
this hey we're moving whoa whoa so we
just calm down everyone just calm down
