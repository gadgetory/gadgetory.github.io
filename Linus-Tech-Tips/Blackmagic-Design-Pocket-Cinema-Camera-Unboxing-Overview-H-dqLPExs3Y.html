comm slash Vengeance gaming to learn
more this my friends is a little bit
unusual for us this is the Blackmagic
pocket Cinema Camera and if you're not
familiar with Blackmagic what they've
basically done is they've taken the
camera industry and kind of given it a
wake-up call given it a shake but the
introduction of their two and a half K
Blackmagic Cinema Camera they introduced
like massive dynamic range which
basically amounts to capturing detail in
low-light and highlight at the same time
giving you a lot more flexibility in
post-processing to work with the footage
so they introduced that camera for just
like wicked crazy low pricing then they
turned around and introduced a 4k
version for $4,000 and a 1080p version
for $1000 and dropped the pricing on the
two and a half K to 2500 bucks so
essentially for every line of vertical
resolution you're paying about a dollar
which is you know sounds great on paper
and all that but what do you actually
get and the answer is you get a pretty
wicked looking image we're actually
going to include some test footage that
Brandon b-roll took with this particular
camera because we've already actually
opened it up before at the end of the
video so do check that out but let's
start with what's inside instead of
including stupid discs they include yay
an SD card that has the software and
manuals unlike the two and a half K and
the 4k camera it doesn't come with a
full version of DaVinci Resolve which is
black magics color correction software
so it just comes with the lite version
which it should be noted is actually
free for download for anyone
so it's thousand-dollar software for the
full version so it makes sense that with
a thousand dollar camera they didn't
necessarily include that next inside we
find the power adapter which you may
actually find yourself needing because
the integrated battery is not really
anything special there we go as well as
international plugs so there's our
normal u.s. plug that looks like an e u1
wherever the heck all these things are
from alright so they include those as
well as a carry strap and what's neat
about the fact that they include like a
wrist carry strap forward is that
even though it produces some fantastic
images it is small enough to look like
pretty much a normal point and shoot now
when it comes to cameras hardware is a
thing but it's not actually the only
thing
things like codec licensing make a big
difference to what kind of an image a
camera can produce so for example the
camera we're shooting this on the sony
fs7 hundred records in AVC HD which
isn't a fantastic codec in terms of
retaining color information so what that
means is that the image might look great
to you guys but if we're shooting in the
dark or if we're shooting in non-ideal
conditions we might not be able to play
around as much with how the image looks
in post-processing not so with this
particular camera out of the box it
comes with apples ProRes codec which
means basically well the opposite of
what I just said so there's more that
you're going to be able to work with in
post it's better than h.264 which is
better than AVC HD and coming in a
couple of months with a firmware upgrade
you're actually going to be able to use
lossless cinema DNG which is basically
almost like it's raw but it's not
uncompressed raw so there will be a
little bit less flexibility but you
still should be able to do an absolute
butt ton with it in post
given that you can shoot in RAW and it
has 13 stops of dynamic range so we've
only found a handful of cards that will
work with it without dropping frames
including this Sony UHS one card which
is there 94 megabyte per second card so
that's usually a read speed spec which
is sort of irrelevant when you think
about it because rights are what people
actually care about on these devices so
it comes only with a micro four-thirds
mount unlike the two and a half K which
is also has an EF mount option but
unlike the two and a half K camera this
one has an active micro four-thirds
mount which means you can use lenses
that control the aperture electronically
versus being stuck with manual lenses so
I think for that reason a lot of people
were going with the EF mount on the two
and a half K so now you don't have to be
quite as concerned about the lack of
mounting options
speaking of lack of options there's not
a whole lot in terms of stuff going on
here so on the back you find a large LCD
that quite frankly
it's kind of poopy it's not that great
you're going to want to use an external
viewfinder the good news about it is
it's about as big as they could have
made it and it features a one-to-one
zoom in so you can get your focus right
so at least it has that but color really
doesn't look true to life on it at all
you've also got controls over here so
you can navigate the menu this way the
power button is here and then on the
bottom of the camera you find a simple
tripod screw in you've also got the
battery compartment down here which also
contains the SD card reader and the USB
slot for pulling data off of it
speaking of batteries the battery is
nothing special however already even
though it just launched you can get
cheap batteries so don't worry too much
about it in fact it's recommended to
just carry like a two bakka like you
know strap of batteries if you're going
to shoot with this thing on on an
ongoing basis now this is cool on the
top of the camera you've also got
another tripod mount so this is going to
work with standard accessories like
whether you want to you know put like I
don't know like a hot shoe adapter there
or whether you want to mount whatever it
is you want to mount to it that's really
handy and then you've also got dedicated
playback buttons as well as of course a
record button since this does happen to
be a camera which brings us to the left
hand side of the camera where we really
find the bulk of the the i/o so there's
the power in micro HDMI microphone in
more on that in a moment headphones out
for monitoring as well as a LAN sea
connection which is used for remote
control of the camera it's more of a pro
grade feature now that microphone Ian
yeah right now because the preamp built
into the camera just isn't anything
special levels are very very low so most
people are using external audio
recorders in order to get reasonable
audio with the video that they're
shooting with this camera it's possible
someone will release like you know a
dedicated design for this camera preamp
so you'll actually be able to use the
audio input onboard otherwise it's
really recommended to use a zoom or some
other kind of external audio recorder
now before we dive into the menus here I
just want to talk a little bit about the
overall build quality of the camera it
is absolutely beautiful the soft touch
finish on the front of the camera has
just the right amount of grip that you
never feel like you're going to drop it
or lose it but without feeling like it's
just going to flake off and peel off the
back has a slightly more subtle slightly
more plastic feel to it
and then the middle piece right here so
the top piece that wraps all the way
around the side and to the bottom is
solid aluminum and just feels absolutely
fantastic the camera does get a little
bit warm in your hands so that should be
noted however if you buy a ruggedized
case for it or something like this you
will likely never notice those things so
let's dive into a couple of things in
the menu here so number one is white
balance so if you're evaluating the
temperature so the color of your light
the screen doesn't really help the
profiles it shoots and don't really help
because they tend to be quite flat and
the fact that there's not much
granularity to the white balance
selections and will make this a little
bit challenging for some people however
if you're willing to work around it then
you can and particularly if you're
willing to grade it in post
you can usually compensate for any
inaccuracies in while you were shooting
another thing of note so there's that
there's all the microphone options
although you probably won't use them
unless something sort of dramatic
happens over here we've got our
recording options so ProRes right now is
the only option for recording format
dynamic range you can select either film
or video and then you can go anywhere up
to 30 fps this is really cool so this is
a time-lapse interval you can set frames
seconds or actually up to 10 minutes so
it has dedicated time-lapse built into
the camera and then finally we've got
more kind of similar settings including
HDMI overlays or not overlays I think
that pretty much wraps it up other than
to address the black dot issue so very
very strong light sources have been
actually blacking out you can fix them
in post but Blackmagic has a firmware
fix that'll be coming very very soon for
that and I think thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the Blackmagic pocket

reviews and other computer videos like
the video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it and leave a comment if
you thought we did a reasonably good job
of something that really we don't talk
about that much also last thing guys if
you're looking at this going oh wow it's
like a pro grade camera for like a
thousand bucks and sounds like a great
deal maybe I just won't buy like some
other camera
bear in mind the way that this works the
footage you get out of it will have to
be worked on there's no such thing as
you take a video with this camera
of your kids birthday party and it looks
perfect out of the camera this is a pro
grade equipment they expect that you
know how to use software like premiere
or resolve or etc etc etc so that's just
something to bear in mind here guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
