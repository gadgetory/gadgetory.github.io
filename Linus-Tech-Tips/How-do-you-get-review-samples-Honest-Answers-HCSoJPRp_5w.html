calling honest answers where I take
questions that you guys ask me and
answer them honestly today's question
one that I've received many times is how
do you guys get companies to send you
the samples of computer hardware that
you're always showing off well let's get
started
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so there are
two underlying meanings to this question
whenever people ask me some of them want
to become product reviewers or vloggers
or they just want a sponsor to you know
throw them a free video card or SSD for
their new rig while others are just idly
curious about how it is that we get all
these cool products to review or show
off since most people are astute enough
to figure out that no one is crazy or
wealthy enough to buy all of the stuff
that they need to run a tech review
channel our size let's start with the
folks who want to know how to get review
products for themselves since that's a
simpler answer and here it is sorry but
basically you can't if life works that
way that would be super cool but it
doesn't unfortunately and the odds of a
PR or media relations contact even
replying to you unless you're affiliated
with a significant publication is very
very low software sometimes works on a
different set of rules since there's no
actual bill of materials for emailing
someone a license key but physical items
that have a real cost like money that
had to be paid to a supplier or a
factory associated with them are not
handed out without some kind of benefit
in return this is known as ROI or return
on investment now there are exceptions I
actually had a viewer contact me once
asking for advice on how to review
some SSDs that he had managed to finagle
out of crucial and Intel of all people I
mean - tech tips has never gotten an SSD
sample from crucial to which I replied
well dude you really should have thought
of that before you requested review
samples SSDs are among the most
complicated devices to properly review
than I gave them some homework that
involved reading every SSD article ever
published on a non tech starting with
the X 25m review which he either didn't
do or didn't understand based on the
finished video and that is exactly why
most people never will and probably
never should get a review sample if a PR
agent cares about his or her job because
they've generally given little to no
thought to the ROI I used to handle
sample requests said NCIX by the way
don't bother contacting retailers why
would they have samples and I'd get
presentations that are like hey if you
guys give us eight twenty four port
networks which is we can have a
200-person LAN party and I'd be like
good for you that delete instead of
asking what a hardware manufacturer can
do for you instead of sending a
presentation that outlines the cool
games you plan to play on your free
graphics card figure out what unique and
compelling value that you will provide
in return which doesn't mean that I'm
saying that you should be some kind of a
cheap whore Ribble shill that was close
posting misleading positive reviews in
exchange for a product most brands by
the way will not even be willing to
engage in that kind of marketing because
a it's deceptive to the real customers
and be in America anyway it is outright
illegal so find another way to justify
it I mean maybe a really cool guide
centered around that product or
prominent positioning in a build log
with many posts in the threads across a
bunch of forums online which I guess
leads us pretty well into how we handle
things part two of this how does Linus
tech tips get access to review samples
well it's pretty straightforward the
company thinks that their product is
awesome so they send a unit to us and
hope that we will agree with them and
post a favorable review PR
really doesn't get any cheaper or more
effective than that since sending out a
loaner unit is just the price of a
return label and even a keeper unit is
only the cost of the product itself
which is nothing compared to a decent
sized ad campaign on Facebook or a TV
commercial or whatever they are taking a
risk that the findings we present won't
be positive but with some exceptions
Astro never replied to me again after I
posted a negative review of their a 50
wireless headset most of the brands that
we've ever worked with value our honest
feedback
even if they didn't get the result they
wanted and will work with their product
development team to make it better the
next time around though with that said
we've gotten to the point where sending
us something isn't that risky since I'm
negative review seems to generate a bump
in the sales of a given product for some
reason anyhow so it's gotten pretty easy
for us to request whatever it is that we
need which leads us back to the first
answer again before wrapping this up why
is it easy for you Linus but not for me
the viewer brands love influencers and
they come in many forms influencers who
are really good at something directly
related to the product so like eSports
players gaming and preferably winning
with Logitech or Razer mice would be a
perfect example of this influencers that
are good at something only sort of
related to the product or service being
offered so this is where the good ol
picture of the athlete on the box of
Wheaties comes in or influencers that
are just cool so cool that brands want
their products nearby however untalented
the individuals may be wherever
consumers are directing their eyeballs
that is where brands want to put their
products which is how content like seven
gamers one CPU came to be so that my
friends is what you will need if you
want anyone to reply to your emails
influence or eyeballs which means that
if your plan is to be a phone reviewer
or something and you don't see a way out
of this chicken and egg box where you
can't get any phones until you're an
established phone reviewer and you can't
your phone reviewer until you get phones
then frankly you need to get more
creative I mean
I worked at a computer retailer which is
how I got access to computer hardware
and lots of guys start out making simple
guides that are applicable to any device
to establish themselves before they get
into the more high-end stuff that is
either expensive or you need a media
contact for you'll need to think outside
the box because I can guarantee that
your path to success will be different
from mine or anyone elses I hope this
video clears it up and on that subject
tunnel bear tunnel bear is the easy to
use VPN app for mobile and desktop
it lets you tunnel to 20 different
countries allowing you to browse the
Internet and use online services as
though you are in a different country so
whether it's something as mundane as you
know oh hey I want to watch that online
video but it's region-locked
or something as obscure as like that
time that I wanted to buy a Google glass
and they wouldn't even allow people
outside of the US to access the website
let alone enter payment information and
by the bloody thing Tunnel there has got
you covered
they've got apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac they also have a Chrome extension
and it's super easy to use like
seriously they actually made it like so
easy a toddler could do it the
application just pops out of the system
tray and there's like a little switch
and you just click on the switch and it
goes I am off click I am on and when
it's turned on your connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and your public IP gets switched so that
whatever websites and services you're
accessing look at you and think oh gee
this guy is coming from or gal is coming
from this other place but actually
you're from a completely different place
and they keep it simple there's no port
configuration DNS or any other nonsense
tunneled error handles that in the
background or the underground as it were
they do have tunnels these bears the
best part of tunnel bear is that you can
actually try it for nothing they will
give you 500 Meg's of data for free so
you can figure out if tunnel bears right
for you before you got to plunk down a
few bucks a month for an unlimited plan
and oh by the way you can save 10% on
that by going to tunnel bear comm /l tt
