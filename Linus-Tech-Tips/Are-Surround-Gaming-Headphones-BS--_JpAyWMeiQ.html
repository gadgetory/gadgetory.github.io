okay this should be fine so I'm gonna go
through this door backwards wait shoot
it's behind me before where come on I
mean like I can tell he's like behind me
but I can't tell exactly where he is it
sucks oh what's this
surround sound in a head sack heck yeah
I can get into that hold on a minute you
still only got two speakers I mean is it
even any good
it's like surely you'd need Oh so this
is is full true 7.1 surround sound in a
headset look at look at all this there's
so many drivers in here what is the best
way to get surround sound out of a
headset there's only one way to find out
by comparing them all
are you looking for an affordable and
reliable VPN well private Internet
access has got your back they encrypt
your internet traffic and use a safe
protected IP check it out today at the
link below
surround sound is nothing new I mean
we've had quadrophonic records since the
70s and I mean there's nothing special
right just add more speakers and boom
the sound is all around you'd easy
haha except not really unless the audio
was recorded binaural e with dual
microphones positioned like human ears
they're special processing required in
the studio to convert the mono audio
that's typically recorded in sound
booths and movie sets or in YouTube
videos into stereo or surround and
traditionally this conversion has been a
highly manual and artistic process that
locks down the number of audio channels
that are available but current-gen
surround sound technologies like Dolby
Atmos and DTS X get around this channel
hard lock limitation by actually
processing where a sound should be in 3d
space at the studio allowing your
receiver to take this information and
then approximate that location as best
it can using whatever speakers it has
available this technology is called
object based surround and I'm bringing
it up because it just so happens to be
very similar to how many games have
processed their audio for years so what
nearly all of our surround sound
headsets are doing is taking our game
audio or at minimum a surround audio
stream with this positional data and
using what's called a head related
transfer function or HRT F for short to
process it in such a way as to mimic the
way that your ears perceive the
directionality of sound which is super
complicated by the way and has to do
with like the curvatures of the growths
on the side of your head and like all
that kind of stuff
that's not the only way to do it though
that's right this here is the brute
force method so this headset has five
drivers
her ear to actually provide the front
rear side Center and subwoofer channels
that you'd expect in a straight surround
sound system firing directly into your
ear balls now the question here is which
one of these solutions is better a chart
CF based surround makes a lot of sense
that is as long as your head is roughly
the same size as the head that it was
coated for and meanwhile true 7.1
methods like razors TM at 7.1 are
potentially agnostic to the shape of
your head but all those extra speakers
limit the maximum size of the individual
drivers and they add weight and
complexity to our setup besides we don't
know yet if either these methods
actually work so without further ado
then it's time for some science in order
to test these headsets we're going to
use overwatch thanks to its excellent
surround mix the setup is simple load up
the shooting range
then grab soldier 76 and sprint over
next to these BOTS that you periodically
once here will blindfold our participant
spin the viewport around choose a
headset at random and then have the test
subject point out where they think the
shooting is coming from once that's done
we'll have them take the mouse and
blindly aim at the bots since we only
care about the horizontal accuracy I'll
adjust the vertical axis so we can
measure how far away they are from
hitting the bots and rinse and repeat
then it's on to the next victim
so after tallying the results it seemed
relatively random whether or not most of
the participants picked the right
direction when it came time said to
actually aim but there are at least a
few takeaways here starting with that
dolby atmos for headphones which is a
software solution ended up with more
direct hits than any other combination
while the razer man-of-war came in
second also the clear loser here is the
razer TM at 7.1 we're more often than
not the target was actually completely
off screen
nothing to the true seven-point-one
thing after all now when it comes to
pointing out the source of a sound
though the best results came from the
logitech g930 3 and the asus rog Strix
fusion 700 with an average variation of
only 6% across all of our tests which is
less than half of the overall average
our control stereo headset sat at just
under 12% with every other contender
except for Dolby Atmos for headphones
ending up being actually worse poor
razer
interestingly even with our admittedly
small sample size it quickly became
clear that the people who were more
accustomed to headphone gaming tended to
be the best at zeroing in on where they
thought a sound was coming from which
makes sense given the sweeping pattern
they employ while ironically enough
everybody else seemed to have better
results when pointing out the initial
direction perhaps as a result of the
gamers being very accustomed to their
own setups it's hard to say for certain
for now though let's get back to the
question at hand
our surround gaming headphones BS
according to our testing the answer is
mostly with the exception of Asus
proprietary solution the most successful
things we tried were all either Dolby or
DTS based so done in software which
tells me that there really is no such
thing as a good surround gaming headset
I mean Asus comes with ROG motherboards
and you can even buy Dolby Atmos for
headphones on the Windows Store with a
DTS option coming soon and those can be
applied to any stereo headphones which
means that the real answer is something
that many of you probably already knew
if you want the best gaming audio then
you just get good audio there's no such
thing as gaming headphones just good
headphones paired with the processing
solution that works best for you and the
good news about that is that these
software solutions actually tend to have
free trials or in Razors case are even
actually free outright so then with
audio being such a subjective experience
it's on you guys to try it out with your
own headphone
and your own ears and find your sweet
spot could listening inspire you to
start something new
