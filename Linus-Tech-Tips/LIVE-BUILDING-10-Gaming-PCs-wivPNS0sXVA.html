right prepare to witness the feat the
likes of which you have rarely if ever
seen unless you worked at a company that
assembles pcs so basically what's what's
shakin tonight is we're having our first
ever games night here in the Linus Media
Group lounge and here come on a little
closer nd we see we've got all these
board games over here but like I was
playing some a no eighteen hundred last
night and I was like you know it'd be
really cool is if we could do the actual
LAN party at the games night tomorrow
too and so it was the afternoon and I
was kind of sitting there going you know
I've actually done pretty much all the
videos that I need to do for this week
maybe I could go chip away at some of
the some of the computers that we have
to build and then I got to thinking what
do I even employ all these people for
you do a quick like what why am i gonna
build all the computers myself that's
that's absurd nah dog so I have
recruited 10 helpers so we've got Alex
Clark we've got Enzo Iago
we've got kolten Potter su PP Dean
stride Dennis I don't know what his last
name is I can't pronounce it David go
chair we've got Mateus who you've
actually never met before technically
he's on probation and he's not allowed
but his probations going real good so
it's unlikely he's gonna get like canned
so good job Mateus and also Anthony who
you all know so we're gonna work
together to try and get this entire land
center from piles of parts to completely
finished gaming rigs in time to play
games on them tonight
ah does anybody need a screwdriver okay
I haven't I fixed it kit Jake just for
anyone who doesn't already know what is
the penalty for losing a bit from one of
Linus's screwdriver kids it's death its
death so okay who wants it all right
there you go there you go
and I got
anyone wants one of the it's not the
stats their budget not snap-on but it's
the same thing I would take that they'll
take that one will you lose any bits all
right so this whole thing is brought to
you guys by C sonic so see sonic Oh are
the ones who sent over there completely
overkill from titanium 1000 watt 80 plus
titanium modular power supplies for
these rigs these things are freaking ba
and they're completely overkill for the
specs that we're using but see sonic
sponsoring the project and that's what
they wanted to say man I wasn't gonna be
like oh heck no man I don't want no
thousand watt 80 plus titanium send me
something worse so that's you can check
them out at the link in the video
description let's go ahead and get
started so the main plan is for Alex
Clark to be kind of our caller for for
chair assembly are you ready to rock on
that cuz yeah guys we don't just have to
build the rigs we also have to actually
assemble the desks that they're gonna go
on and the chairs that our butts are
gonna go in so we've got to is this the
one that you just finished matthias
right here so we've got two desks ready
to go one we're using as a staging area
for the chairs and the other one that's
just on standby right now so I guess the
best thing for us to start with is
anyone who's not really doing something
right now raise hands okay David Denis
Eady Anthony and Colton are you you're
doing something alright so the rest of
you Alex is going to get you guys
started on chair assembly so I'm gonna
help you guys get set up with all the
pieces you need oh man
keeping this organized with this motley
crew is not going to be simple so we're
doing our best
so each land PC has a box that all the
boxes for the parts are going to go in
so we can keep everything kind of
organized the problem is that
the thing about systems is that they
tend to take up a lot of space so each
of our chair assemblers needs to find a
spot kind of on the floor here I think
where you're not in Mattias is way and
you're not in the way of the parts that
are over there so David what else do you
need I can bring you everything you need
so you need the rest of one of these
boxes right okay so here's the rest of a
box you also need this piece and the
star bottom right okay I got you fam go
go ahead and get started so Alex yeah
we're getting all the pieces of the
chairs here and then do you guys want to
just use your own instructions or Alex
are you going to guide everyone you kind
of started without them is there only
have one drill oh okay
so is there anything that they can prep
for you though okay
so never mind you guys are not doing
what I said you were doing you're gonna
yeah you're gonna put wheels
okay so Alex needs a helper Anthony
you're Alex's helper and then ed Dennis
and David you guys are putting wheels on
bases and and cylinders on the other end
of the bases all your bases are belong
to got it I can do that is that Phillips
head all right no problem
Anthony you are Alex's helper thank you
what are the two what are the three
tapered screws for
okay got it
so I leave those for now and then now
there's five of these big ones what's
the deal with that
oh okay cool and do we know which way
this goes okay Anthony can you find that
out okay there we go
I'm gonna guess for now and we're gonna
see how that goes for us I actually
think it probably goes the other way
okay cool well that worked out really
well so far so while I'm doing this I
can actually walk you guys through sort
of how this project came to be basically
we expanded into this additional unit
here with the intent of using it all for
storage and then we actually got another
one as you guys probably saw in the
gamers Nexus tour a really good tour you
guys should go check that out for sure
Steve and this team did a great job so
we expanded into another unit that's
going to be storage and now this one we
decided to do something more fun with so
we're turning about half of it into an
employee lounge full of like game stuff
and gaming rigs and all that good stuff
so I think sorry what's that no I don't
think you legally need an employee
lounge after a certain number you do I
don't think so actually James I'm anyway
that's not why we did it so we did it
because we think we should but whatever
so anyway I can use this opportunity
though to walk through with you guys out
what kind of systems we're putting
together for this and also give a
massive shout out to everyone who
so we're starting of course with the
chairs actually Max anomic chairs were
the first chair company that I ever did
a review of and I loved that chair so
much that it is still my daily driver
chair now I absolutely love their chairs
just really really nice construction
especially in just like the C of kind of
crummy gaming chairs that are out there
really a fan of just a nice high quality
foam that they use like you can't feel
the boards or the bars or anything like
that in the seats and they also do a
bunch of really cool stuff now that they
didn't do before like check this out so
we've got LTT logos on all of the chairs
that they did up for the land center
here which is pretty freakin sick
yeah they look really good actually
hey Jake do you remember if the the
pillows are also LPG logoed no they're
not or you don't remember they're not
okay
ah can someone get me a gas cylinder to
put this put this chair on or I guess I
could do it no David can do it remember
we also need the shroud for it though oh
boy this is kind of chaos I believe so
does it go in that way okay cool can you
guys guide me in David hey hey you know
the Chum yeah hey let's try again guide
me in again David okay are we good is it
assembled
okay cuz once I sit on it it's not
coming off okay cool ah excellent I'll
take a handle or I'll take a side thing
yes I'll take a side thing all right
oh yeah so right I said I was gonna go
through everyone who provided hardware
and the specs of all of these rigs cuz
it actually changed a couple of times
funny story we were gonna go with Intel
machines at first and then we had some
trouble getting our hands on chips as
you guys may or may not be aware Intel's
had a bit of a bit of a shortage
situation on their 14 nanometer
processors so they weren't able to get
any of those over to us so AMD stepped
in and we actually did an entire video
talking about the difference in
performance between AMD and Intel for
gaming and while for some games in
particular it was quite noticeable what
we observed was that at the refresh rate
and resolution that we're gonna be
playing at it actually doesn't matter
and that leads me to question Matthias
what happens to the monitors and have
they sent the right ones yet you've got
backup monitors do you now oh that's
awkward we had the old one still oh okay
we might have to we might have to crack
open the old ones did you put that side
piece on oh oh yeah there's a screw
that's fine I've got the screw I thought
maybe it was in so you're putting on the
bottom handle
ah these side ones are kind of hard to
put on - actually that's not the
greatest experience I've ever had but
hey once they're assembled they're great
dang it I got a screw this in well Andy
you can go around and visit other people
you know what I'll run through everyone
who sent over hardware in a little bit
oh man this is this is not going in East
oh you know what that's good any good
enough okay
so is this the is this done no no that's
right that's the other side oh the bat
yeah the back is there yeah there you go
so this is the leg this button okay and
then we just need one more of those
handles for the gas lift boom I also
feel like I don't know how this works
I'll brace you push okay bull what's
that complete chair yeah yeah it's
getting out of here okay
oh this rolls out real nice how many
miles are on this puppy this is audio
level we should reply to you want to
grab my laptop it's in my backpack right
next to me you can use that to monitor
that stream oh it's just that mic oh
okay I'll let you know that's what you
do what you don't hit the chair Dennis -
where's your lap Oh
like I'm gonna take this off now hold on
honey don't hit don't hit I'm not pull
back what do you mean put me on the spot
Colton's got to tell you some more stuff
about Max not oh my gosh dude so max
anomic they're great they've got a
selection guy that helps customers to
find the right chair based on height and
weight Lyonne sorry talk to the
embroidery service and they have bulk
deals available for businesses that you
can check out and you can learn more at
LMG dot GG /
max anomic
we will make a video presenter out of
you yet just kidding Wow hey Colton can
you guide me in here Wow the piston into
the chair first and then the some of the
backwards reverse well is it in turn it
into a one-person job
oh you turn the one-person job into a
two-person and that goes okay so that
these chairs are kind of starting to
come along here I think we're gonna have
three done shortly then we're gonna have
another
oh yeah okay so you need a gas space
Anthony here we go just adjust the angle
towards you a little you can keep going
towards you towards you towards you and
we should be on there and one two three
that's on okay so Holton when you're do
you want to be the guy who does these
side bits and I'm annoyed yeah sure okay
cool
what are you reading instructions from
how to do that yeah was I was trying to
see this said the only thing I don't
have right now
this is me this is you need a friend oh
don't have okay so you take this yeah
yeah but isn't there a okay god yes
alright yeah and then you do the same on
the other side these handles yeah we
just don't just pop them BAM it sounds
good yeah perfect instructions anymore
yeah yeah yeah here that's fine no no no
no no no no no no no no no new new new
okay we want to keep whoops organized
you guys so excited excellent
yep so what
maybe we should streamer stream on the
line of stream on the line is tech
channel after after windchill what
you're doing I'm standing here for now
me at all you're not able to put that
thing in what do you have in trouble
yeah it goes yeah where does the screw
go the screw goes in the hole yeah but
then how does it actually speaker :
it's it's just a sticker there's a hole
there why would you put okay look got it
he's really really good at other stuff
combined you
this one right here behind you no needs
beside this okay I can help them here
all right
we're kind of we're kind of getting this
figured out man needs chairs it's like
the thing about assembling his chair is
it doesn't really take very long but
even a short job times ten takes a long
time you know
know what I'm saying you okay Anthony
you did you have to you have to fill up
the bank it's important everyone be
careful and try not to get cut it's
gonna slow us down also because I care
okay that's not an achievement for this
James I'm just about done with this one
but I actually have a really hard time
putting the bottom handles on meet you I
do you think you can help me with that
it requires a little bit more arm
strength how do you do that where they
go they go on the bottom handle saw in
there yeah on there it's pretty fun I
think
JDate does anyone care about this this
dream 13 thousand people are watching 15
hey guys cool I promise we're gonna get
to the PCs as soon as humanly possible
that's the part that we're looking
forward to to actually once I'm finished
putting this chair together maybe I'll
walk you guys through the three C's what
we're building because they're pretty
sick some pretty sick rigs actually all
right my night so James
oh yeah I'll do this one ah can't see in
the whole dark
we have a mallet you got oh we do okay
guys this is the new way to put the
handles on the chairs new and improved
how many chairs are we done Danny - yes
what feel like parts of this assembly
liner yeah yeah Alex it's easy to point
with others and when you when you point
it someone else
three fingers point back so here's also
the other way they've got like this want
to help me put the finishing touches on
this one you got to do different things
yeah are you a new L Tina are you
pimping the new l TT huh actually I
think that's live on the store right now
so we've got fifty dollars we've got
black
make sure you put your initials in it
though make sure you put your initials
in it though because people will be
wearing these trying to steal yours oh
yeah oh it says the red one if you want
to go check it out Andy oh so that's on
okay people back home right now yeah I
don't know what would you call it yeah
sure it's a burgundy color
you got the mallet right thanks for that
just maybe not when I'm finding the
screw you're gonna have to he've it
leave on it just give her well the other
one did without a mallet no yeah that's
why the tap will do the one I had just
now was really hard I don't need to side
yeah so here if we just turn it around
then I can do my size four years ago I'm
sorry yeah that's fine that's for me
some of these don't pop on real yeah in
Colton's defense when we couldn't figure
this out some of them really are a
little bit its locks are unlocks that
bottom the base tilting gets on this
yeah so that's stupid thing that the
stupid button Karen always presses on
the chair that's the one that one done
what about this one is this one done
yes you don't sound click this together
remember why are there such as cruise I
think the base might not be
guys are killing me here what no girl
there's tears out there that one's
missing wheels okay here's more screws
and I've actually got a few more we
should have a wad of experts to you can
you put them on
I don't think that's no did you build
that other chair that was missing the
foot no I did I build it in hindsight
doing this on the floor within what
yeah no that's still not there I think
he didn't build the one who was amazing
okay just push it computers - I need a
shirt that says I'd rather be building
computers yeah we should do a shirt
versatility building content emerge item
right there that's how it happens ladies
and gentlemen lightning strikes the cam
to him in a dream this is my dream looks
like me and a bunch of guys on our knees
on the floor
I'm sure Anthony are you assemble this
kind of uncomfortably close I'm just
putting screws in a chair oh nothing
super interesting pretty good
okay wonderful cases I have chairside
handles do you want handles - he wants
everything Tennessee's insatiable
he's insatiable ladies and gentlemen
husband now it I need the mallet for
this oh there's the pointy ones yeah
that's really inefficient though we
almost done the chairs for that I don't
know if you're putting the Amazon all
the way genius
we're so close to getting these chairs
done for Matias right Matias your true
friend specifically a trooper we said
that that was Tom's hand are you gonna
catch this victory victory laughs right
here me and David
this is not a great victory lap shooting
his review of the Blackmagic pocket 4k
making too much noise for him oh you
guys are the chairs done are we done
ladies and gentlemen okay when you roll
them out there be quiet because Brendan
will get mad at you otherwise okay
mission accomplished so now I can
finally walk you guys through what we're
gonna be dealing with here for the PCs
after I drink this refreshing water from
this Linus tech tips water bottle hmm
upside down sorry one moment please
gotta get my I gotta get my water
bottles good side here LTTE store.com
ladies and gentlemen oh yeah we've
actually got the limited edition
commemorative Roast t-shirts up there
right now too so we're only making a
couple hundred of these so ya know there
will be no James DNA included with
people of t-shirts okay you know I'm
gonna grab three so NPC three let's go
through and let's uh let's show what
kind of sex we're gonna be dealing with
here so we decided to go micro ATX
because we wanted nice compact machines
but without compromising all of the
upgrade ability by going ITX because
we're gonna need some expansion cards so
we're using coarse hairs crystal 280x
because tempered glass RGB micro ATX
looks really good all that good stuff so
that was our case of choice for this
project in terms of our processors these
are these are kind of loose Matthias how
do you want to handle the CPU
assignments Tyler wants to do that oh
well like we're kind of ready you want
to go get Tyler okay so we're using
Rison 2700 X processors because we
couldn't wait for the upcoming Zen two
based ones which I have a feeling we're
gonna really regret what's really cool
about what AMD is doing these days is
that we're finally back to buyer's
remorse when you buy computer hardware
because you actually get like
generational performance improvements go
figure
so that's neat like sucks to be us but
like pay better than not having
performance improvements so that's cool
we're going with ah yes so here's our
box of memory oh hey this is the
accessory box for a level 20 GT surely
someone's been looking for that cuz
that's not where that's supposed to be
okay so in here we've got our vengeance
RGB pro memory so these are 26 66
megahertz 16 gig kits guys I know I know
that this isn't as fast as we would want
for Rison I know originally we were
going Intel
okay that's why we're using these I mean
we're gonna be like a Corsair we're
gonna change our around hello so that
goes there and then for our boot drives
we're going with MP 300 nvme SSDs these
are 480 gigas and the original plan was
to do these and then obtain acceleration
on our mechanical drives but funny story
the board the the pro board from Asus
the tough pro an ATX board for AMD that
does have two nvme slots is not
available in this region so we couldn't
get it so we're just going with nvme and
then we're gonna use primo cache to
partition off maybe like 80 gigs of this
and use that to accelerate the hard
drive if anyone isn't sure what to do
right now go ahead and grab a max on a
chair box and start loading in the same
things as I am so you can start getting
ready for assembly all right so next
time yes this is gonna be good so we're
going to lift 10 gig Knicks from a
quanta and the reason for this has
nothing to do with gaming this is all
about making sure that when we're
installing games it's going fast so I
you know because we've got like 12 rigs
here so we want a 10 gig network with a
steam cache elsewhere on the network
which we already have so that way when
we're all like hey we're gonna play some
black ops and we all press download at
the same time there's gonna be no
bottleneck and we can download our games
off of our own server and even faster
than gigabit speeds so much faster than
Steam would be able to deliver them to
us so every system gets a 10 gig NIC go
ahead and grab a 10 gig NIC in fact you
guys can load up more than one box if
you go over who's getting ahead of me
here no so far we have a 280x case a 10
gig NIC an MP 300 SSD and a vengence RGB
profile get carried away ladies and
gentlemen here's a bunch of D brand
skins which has nothing to do with
anything other than that D brand
graciously skinned our tables for us and
they look freakin awesome with this true
textured 3m vinyl like honeycomb pattern
I forget what they call it but it looks
amazing
everybody needs a commander Pro because
we're going full RGB for these builds so
everybody grab a commander Pro please
yes all right we're all gonna need a
tough series B 4050 M + gaming
motherboard there's nothing about a
motherboard that makes it particularly
gaming that doesn't matter basically it
had the features we needed in terms of
processor support and it's got 4 RAM
slots we thought it had enough m dot 2
slots but it didn't lol joke's on us
I've has ideal slot spacing for us so
we're gonna do our graphics card right
here it's going to take up these two and
then we're gonna do our 10 gig NIC
right here so it's gonna get pulled and
whit's there so there you go that's what
that looks like is there another
Commander Pro ah okay one of the systems
have two commander pros do now let's get
out ahead and take two commander pros no
you didn't actually I don't think alex
has a commander pro at all okay we'll
get back to you on that okay everybody
needs an RT x 2070 graphics card so
basically we're gonna be gaming at 2560
by 1440 once they soo swaps up the
monitors for us and this was kind of a
without totally break breaking the bank
sweet spot so we're still gonna have
support for RTX but honestly we weren't
that worried about it as a feature
because none of the competitive games
are gonna be playing care about that so
it's got about the performance of a GTX
1080
but with extra features and doesn't
break the bank that's why we went with
that um also we've got these nice dual
fan these nice dual fan so these rigs we
actually have one of them completely
built up they are surprisingly quiet
even under load because hey we've gone
way overkill on the CPU cooling so we're
using h100 i RGB platinum coolers these
are so far overkill for rising 2700 X
but whatever there you go hold RGB baby
if you guys need me to distribute these
what you mean I thought other boards we
ordered what next round we did
you did okay okay all right
everybody needs a lighting node Pro
accept system - oh that may be what
happened with our other RGB thing system
- already has it installed in the case
okay cool so everyone needs a light a
node Pro Dennis you gentle beautiful
human back to the back to roast mode is
you sweet just give me everything okay
so every system gets I think to light
loop fans don't quote me on that one
though it's gonna be interesting who
each - each - each yeah we okay so we're
doing this like old-school
fire fire with fire dept styloid if
there's a lot extras then it's probably
three per system so let's see how that
goes all right power supply time so
everybody needs a see sonic frying
titanium thousand watt 80 plus titanium
power supply not because they actually
need that kind of wattage because but
because see Sonic sponsored this build
and that's what they sent over so we are
yeah we're going with it
so okay I have two pens
everyone got two fans man this is gonna
take us a while I wanna start
distributing power supplies power supply
oh hey guys I have guys I have a whole
mother box of commander pros and
lighting node pros so are we actually
are we actually short on the RGB for any
system ones missing at commander Pro
okay David all right well at any rate
you know those are there so we can put
that with the extra all right now of
course our systems would not be complete
without peripherals and that's where our
friends at logitech came in so
everybody's getting their Brio 4k pro
webcam
here you go sir yeah Ben okay why do I
even hand these things to Dennis he just
turns around and hands them to someone
else box right next to put stuff in
right there no I don't have mess up like
I don't want you to mess up either but
like all right cool are you guys did
anybody notice that's on edge we have an
echo that short of cooler all right wait
is it system - no okay all right all
right nice so we went with Wow Logitech
sent over g9o fries for all of them
those are extras deep for a wireless oh
wow we Reggie Pro is everyone ever you
guys are applauding apparently were
apparently we're really excited about G
pro Wireless
where are the G pro Wireless alright
well we'll get to the keyboards first
you know what and all this new headsets
first so we've got Logitech G Pro
headset so I need one of those and no
I'm not giving it to Marcus no all right
fine so actually distributing this Fred
oh wait these are D 935 okay well I
don't I don't know I guess we have Jake
so we've got oh wow so some of them get
powerplay mousepads
oh so okay we're not gonna worry about
the powerplay mouse pads or 903 s or 703
so these are the ones that have that
perpetual charging technology so we're
gonna see if some of the lucky stations
get those all right now we need
keyboards g5 13 carbons so these are
using their romaji linear switches and
of course RGB up the wazoo all right
these are heavy all right and finally
cheaper wire lessons so wait do we not
have enough G Pro wireless as for all of
the stations there should be 12 yeah all
right well we'll find out cuz there
might be 12 total mice here by my count
we're supposed to use DS and 703 s on
some of the stations I guess we will
find out later finally because we want
this set up to be capable of streaming
as well and no offense to Logitech's
headset but this is a better option they
actually recently acquired blue so
they're sent over 12 of their yeti nanos
and we're gonna have those set up on all
the stations as well so if anyone wants
to stay after work and stream on their
you know channel or do whatever these
stations are all gonna be set up with 4k
webcams and Getti nanos you have I
already took plenty tonight
okay all right I can't be done I need
one more than you need one more than
Elmore that's it for the Eddie nanos I'm
richer how extent it's all absolutely
Alex broke the system okay so guys the
CPUs have all been written down by
Matias over here so what you do is you
take your CPU when you're assembling a
system everybody got that we're just
gonna leave those somewhere safe until
we're ready to actually install them in
the motherboard okay
so um who all is ready to grab a system
and go go just pick a number actually
hold on no before we do that I'm gonna
show you guys system 1 because system 1
is built the way that we expect all of
them to be built at the end I believe
this is system 1 ok so this one was
built by me for better for worse wait no
also the extra mics are just for
preference if people want to use other
mics nice nice you don't get to like
pick them but you don't have an assigned
station like oh there's 12 we have over
20 employees that's not the way it works
okay
the stations are reserved
okay so here we go guys this is the
expectation for the final build so this
is our this is what our finished rigs
are gonna look like alright so I want to
walk you guys through a couple quick
things here everybody gather around okay
so cable management on the back we're
not too concerned about that you're
basically just kind of shoving
everything back there alright that's
that level of expectation we're a bit of
a hurry here all right
the hard drives um oh Jake did we ever
figure out where this hard drive wasn't
showing up we did that ones assigned to
you yeah system one might have may have
one small issue with the hard drive
there so that's the plan there and then
actually I forgot one piece for all the
systems we're using cable mod wire
extensions in order to get that nice
clean that nice clean look there so RGB
strips go nope not top so back bottom
front I don't think I have one on top oh
yeah I do
sorry back bottom front and talk so full
RGB we're doing the tubes towards the
front of the case we're doing these
front ones as an intake and we're
actually doing the top ones as an intake
as well so we're gonna be massively
positive pressure inside
the reason for that is that they're all
filtered so it's not a huge deal and
they look better when we see the front
of the fence so it's purely for looks
not for performance if we were doing it
for performance we'd probably go in and
out okay that would be smarter all right
um
I'm gonna put this over on the rack over
there okay guys yeah I can take off the
panels I'm not gonna drop it so Oh Jake
are you distributing the cables yeah
you're grabbing a system right yeah all
right how long is this gonna take us do
we have anywhere to build systems like
do we have enough tables ready yet or
can we do three people to a table what
do you think all right so Anthony you
okay so I want all the experienced
builders to take a new so Anthony you
get Dennis more assignments Alex you are
taking actually most of the other people
here
all right Oh James okay James you're on
your own
and I guess yeah James you're on your
own actually yeah yeah actually it's
Jeff with James David you're on your own
okay who's with Alex you're over here
hey cold air okay I think I'm ready guys
this is critical to hold all the
accessories and packing material and and
manuals of whatever blows back in your
box everybody got that otherwise poor
Matthias and Tyler will never be able to
figure out where everything goes
everybody got that you can sign it if
you want but you don't have to be fine
dining table over here
oh wow that's gonna be a challenge fun
okay man so I haven't done like a PC
building workshop in a very long time
I actually did one years ago back when I
worked at NCIX the deal was if you
bought your computer within this certain
time period and you were willing to wait
until this one date to get it you could
come in and I would run a classroom and
teach you how to build your own system
as we did it once or twice a lot of fun
not a huge revenue generator so we
weren't able to continue the program but
it was it was definitely fun so
inexperienced builders follow along with
your teacher and now let's don't get too
far ahead of him this is a cool piece I
built seven of them seven that's a lot
of PC's with my job how RGB so the
trickiest part of these builds is gonna
be the RGB you guys because it's not
trivial to wire it up so that's where
you're gonna want to look at the example
computer and have a look at how it all
goes together all right you know we are
having RGB the gentleman number three
all right cool
Wow okay guys can you take your boxes
and put them under your table like old
mentality they went claiming this one
the two of us come back in ketchup sure
okay okay so you guys are probably not
gonna on the side that works
you're weak you're weak yeah I'll just
run off if you're missing a cable
extension guys they're gonna be over on
the rack on the bottom shelf because I
need this table to build on you don't
have to follow me Annie now that
everyone's getting started let's see how
this goes
I'm trying to take something out of a
box it's fun so I want to I started late
and I'm gonna try and beat everybody
else it's totally one hundred and fifty
percent of race I have Raymond already
and next one is MDOT to get Alex all I
gave Jake one oh we're just getting
parts tray so you don't lose your parts
worse about is CPUs are right there
oh just straight up okay yes it's fine
he's coming from the guy that last time
was scratching the forum like hey you
should stop doing that keeps going
giant scratch like a meter luck oh it's
fine just wipes it off
I've never put an AMD chip do you know
which number your system is I can find
out right now facing you before you
start like talking at it in a cohesive
manner basically the way this works is
this socket slides and that applies
pressure on all the pins it holds it in
place
Oh unless it doesn't have enough force
in which case when you take your CPU
cooler off the CPU just rips out it's a
fun okay but for now you're gonna look
at the little gold triangle thing yep
and there is one every board is
different some of them have it printed
on the PCB but in this case it's on
right in that corner right there okay
you're gonna line it up and front you
don't want to put any pressure at all
just drop try and line it up drop it in
place yeah yeah that dropped in there
you know me just give her a little
wiggle make sure she's good yeah OOP and
there you go you've now installed an AM
horsey I'm an expert yeah that was the
best one
line up the triangle yeah you know just
pull right in okay do you wanna do one
oh god please don't watch me you're
making me nervous
oh god I don't have training so Nick
light just messaged me we have an offer
code for LT t store calm
apparently it's we love money all
lowercase all one word
I don't know what it does because my
email is open in that tab and it's
private information could be on there so
maybe if you look away nd for a second
I'm gonna find out it's $10 off it's $10
off an order of $50 or more I think
that's actually our deepest discount yet
I think we've done five dollars off
don't quote me on that I can't remember
that's the Nick
it's a Nick thing but there you go $10
off orders of $50 or more we've got the
roast shirt we've got the the new hats
Alex can you model a half away from oh
this is beautiful
we've got of course like the classic
got that LTTE there and the phone pocket
told us I don't worry about it um yeah I
think that's all the big news now I've
got to catch up on my build here so I'm
sorry guys but I'm gonna fire up some of
these super chats and then I'm also
gonna try and see if I can finish first
not that it's a race it's not a race is
installing the mounting bracket for the
main controller for the desks so
theoretically well it'll just slot right
in Jake's gonna do a little I'm doing
you'll undo it okay so Dick's gonna do a
little workshop to come over here and
watch what Jake's doing um yeah
cuz it's kind of easy to screw that up
also one other pro tip guys grab at
least wanted to say the cables out of
your motherboard box and pre wire it
ideally both of them just pre wire them
over to the hard drive bays as like a
courtesy connector you ever wanna throw
hard drive in we don't have to redo the
cable management alright we doing how
you doing hey Dennis and you promise
it's gonna be really quiet so you
basically you're gonna take your AIO out
of the box take these brackets off they
just pull out kind of a pain I probably
pulling the wrong way pulling the wrong
way I'm gonna break
pull the brackets off it's harder than
it looks
and then
here there's two AMD brackets ignore
that this is what they look like the
coarser just assume our cpu preference
no you get all of its good of course I
just assumed did they put the Intel on
oh I see no that's just how it comes for
the factory right there and then you
want the little hole on the top here
facing down oh so it's not like this
yeah like that up top and put them so
you can mount it with the Corsair logo
facing up make of it nice yeah I was
terrible
it's oriole but they're gonna stents why
did we use a different racket because
different chips has different that was
pretty good he goes up I think you
nailed it I think you know that guys I
almost put it in the wrong way
whoops we're okay though we're okay I
got this yes
I'm slipping up this a camera dude oh my
god no I have it the wrong way again
there you go I have shaky hands I'm
nervous
what madrenas coffee good I don't have
the memory or two module that I need so
I'm just gonna build the rest of the
case here and we'll see who has some
okay so there's a step we missed now
that we got the brackets on the way this
is am for found so it works is we keep
the stalk and the cookie things and
these little loops just go around and
you tighten the nut on top once the
coolers in place super easy maybe not as
easy as like x2 99 but honestly not that
bad sorry we already have pre applied
thermal paste so we don't need to put
any more of that and sorry what do we do
with these so the little hook you have
to hook things to the loops yeah okay so
basically what happened is this loop is
gonna be around this hook and then
you're gonna screw it through that it's
a little oh I see okay I guess yeah
motherboard is first
okay oh we need an IO shield this make
sure it's the right way this way like
that and bazinga we're good you know
what okay relax
these don't like that word all right
Sheldon says offensive - hey I'm just
you know quietly making up ground over
here I've actually built in this case a
few times so I think I mostly know what
to do I always run into trouble with the
with the lighting node Pro and with the
the RGB fans though getting it all wired
up in the right order is a little bit
tricky and if you want your like your
lighting animations to go all in the
right direction and all that stuff then
you've got to be kind of conscientious
about the way that you do it up I'm
gonna have to double-check my reference
machine in order to do that that'll
definitely save time guys I would
strongly recommend guys I would strongly
recommend installing your power supply
and your RGB lighting like base pieces
like the node pro controller before you
start cabling everything up getting your
RGB lights put in as well and getting
those cables run using that machine as a
reference also strongly recommended
because those are the hardest parts to
wire up like all the wiring takes about
as long as like the rest of the wires it
takes about as long as the RGB wiring on
its own
Oh Jake can you do a PSA for that public
safety announcement we have to move one
of the standoffs I'm pretty sure which
one got it easy just kidding which one
little one down here labeled M needs to
move down to M the next thing that one
needs to move to okay cuz otherwise it's
gonna be touching the back of your
motherboard and that is that need to go
down and down we do the next M right
below it oh yeah hello I fix a kit I'm
using otherwise we're gonna
short-circuit a bunch of other words and
that would be really bad shield on this
board but well BAM we're good there's a
little lovin in the middle to line it up
easy peasy
although I don't have my pixie kit to
tighten it anymore
needlenose pliers
all right there we go they just unscrew
Oh beautiful I'm installing my power
supply as soon as I'm done this this is
the most like every time I'm trying to
do something to like to tell Dennis what
to do
you make an announcement so like so
Anthony you're you have two roles though
to kind of proactively instruct him when
you think of it and also to keep an eye
on them and make sure that he actually
what did you do Dennis this thing just
so not very fun um oh well that way
that's the one that came with the case
right yeah oh that comes out anyway how
do I do it how do I take it out
well not like this you'll have to kind
of get something under it and pull it
out oh yeah so we don't need the stock
RGB controller because we just
okay so you got a look at the connectors
that are on it and unclip them they have
a clip on them on the bottom oh okay
it's wired in oh I'm gonna go get some
sighs okay is this thing but whatever we
thought we're gonna have to replace this
so this is fine and it's named up
Brooklyn just look right it's fine don't
overreact
yeah okay what's next so you're gonna
want to actually remove those things so
why this has gotta get side cutters so
I've got the oh that's just
okay so we don't need it right you don't
want to throw them away
okay that's now okay so now you're gonna
walk to if you open up your right Amanda
Pro yes that's this big doesn't come
with any sticky pads that I can see
which is unfortunate but once you have
once you have this ouch
you will want to put it in the bottom of
the case with doing cables facing
towards the front so that way we can run
them up and over yes if you're not sure
how they go the system that - already
has built over there has them already in
so you can see that it's actually done
then you guys like what honestly
happened with this whole thing was I've
been traveling a lot over the last
probably about five weeks I've been in
the office maybe what like half the time
gyms yeah it's been it's been pretty
rough and so you know I've had a lot of
help like the team has as you guys have
noticed shot a lot of videos without me
including Anthony in particular has AB
no offense to anyone else you guys all
did great
but Anthony like really slayed it with
his build guys he managed to get an
entire build guy shot while I was gone
you did another one yesterday which one
which one was that Anthony yeah artsy
excellent GTX or ray tracing on GTX
rather so he did that community
reception has been really great actually
you guys have been amazing about almost
almost everyone you guys have been like
really kind to as people are kind of
starting to learn you know how to host
videos and getting getting the hang of
it so thank you guys for that but it
doesn't change that I've been traveling
a lot and I really really wanted to be
here for the deployment of the land
center but what that means is that for
the last couple of months this shelf of
parts had just been sitting there
staring at me every time I walk past
like hey if only you had found time to
build these computers you could be
staying after work and gaming and it
would be fun if only you had time for
fun - so um I'm so today it just kind of
boiled over and I was talking to add
about when we could find time to put
doing this video on the schedule and we
had a sponsored Friday release that was
supposed to go up today that they asked
for some changes on and I was so I was
frustrated because I was like okay well
I'd really like to do a live stream but
now I didn't really have a
and I walk past here I was like let's
just do it like yeah like we people have
time today and people were like so we
did it so I'm super stoked cuz we
already had a games night planned
tonight
so now we're gonna play some some Vidya
Vidya games as well it's gonna be
awesome at 11:00 I downloaded this
morning on the Xbox and I'm so stoked
I'm social to play some Xbox I mean yeah
this is well play some PC games too it's
the only game I have a fighting chance
at no I'm not giving him props for that
zero-zero props were given for that joke
oh it was super intentional it's James
Jake of course it was intentional
oh yeah is about them go to it do you
need to already just pull it so what I
did here is because this is already
stuck on there but in the example system
it's not like that it has a sticky on it
you can replace it that thing he's not
gonna keep building oh I guess he has to
edit tech linked okay yeah yeah we need
you Dennis I have all the sources on the
timeline alright so Jake did you ever
actually check how many yeah two to four
okay okay everybody got that
so I know modular cables you need one of
the four SATA harnesses and one of the 2
SATA harnesses okay
a GPU that's 2 or you can do two single
GPUs so it's up to you guys what you
want to do there so this is the pro move
plugging in all your modular cables
before you go any further so I've got my
the 2 SATA harnesses that I told
everyone we need so that'll handle our
lighting node Pro our the RGB on our
cooler that's gonna handle our any hard
drives we want to install down the line
and then I've got 2 8 pin PCI Express
although it's gonna be an 8 plus a 2 but
I'm using extension so you won't see
kind of the messy extra bit hanging off
I've got a 4 plus 4 for my CPU and then
of course I've got my 24-pin connector
from the motherboard so that's
everything and that's ready to go into
my case somehow I ended up with an
entire table to myself so that's pretty
sweet
they're not wear white loops of the case
not our coolers yeah so guys the two
extra fans in your box are for your AIO
cooler we're using light loops
everywhere for that little max RGB
effect you're wrong I was wrong wasted
don't use the fan yep but not the ones
included with the cooler understood yeah
this case includes light loops out of
the box when I took my my case out one
of my fans was like on the top for some
reason already settling a little bit to
the front
yeah I was weird I had to move it at
this mountain here oh yeah so what goes
up here is your radio not those not that
man I thought that no radiator closed
last yes what you should do have you
taken up to the central I'm not sure the
see the center posted this yeah oh yeah
we need to move the donuts on underneath
that down to the bottom hold this while
you can use pliers I was going to use my
find out which one is so I just realized
I had grabbed my laptop to do some super
chats for y'all and then I never
actually did it so let me just grab my
mounting screws for my power supply
which should be in the power supply box
yep
along with some cable ties and all that
good stuff remember this stream is
brought to you by icy Sonic there you go
and be real
Bastardo I am sure that's not your real
last name but that's okay I wouldn't put
every last name on the internet if I had
thought of that either um small love
thanks for the help no problem Gabe oh
yeah okay hold on a second I'm gonna
have to get back to these in a minute I
cannot figure out why this power supply
is lining up here
nevermind oh my god what else we got
here some of them mess shows P 5:22
you're gonna show down to home
automation Act says we love the channel
very funny
Oh guys you got the funny vibe from all
of us we were going for very very
serious at all times just kidding
that's a joke yeah what's up - so we
don't forget
okay guys so if you haven't already put
your m2 SSD on your motherboard Thank
You Colton you're my Vanna don't forget
to do that it's a little bit easier to
do while the motherboard is still
outside of the case good job Anthony and
Dennis you guys want a gold star left I
don't have one you don't have a keep
telling you that I don't have an SSD or
rim that was never given SSD error
are we really short an SSD in RAM maybe
check one of the boxes the box of the
yeah maybe oh yeah where yeah okay so
thanks Alex hello installed in order to
install your SSD you see how you've got
these mounting holes here yep so come on
and have a look at this Andy hey you got
these mounting holes here okay the mount
is not actually installed in there Oh
rabbit out of here and while you're at
it you should grab your i/o shield
you're gonna need that yeah but this
right here so there's a little standoff
it goes in the one mark 20 to 80 and
then there's a little screw you're gonna
make an eye fix-it kit in order to screw
that alright if you slide it in put it
on and put the screw in got it so
hopefully that's okay Jake can show you
hello Denmark have enjoyed the channel
for years love the live shows oh yeah
good roast potato says - and your
underlings inspire me to build absurdly
expensive gaming computers can't thank
you enough for that Alexandre Harvey
shoutout Stephen Willis says no flippin
stranger
I'm gonna take some hot birds and stuff
yeah I found RAM and MSSD so there's
there's a yes there is most assuredly a
floatplane stream flow playing time is
blowin up they're like we are fine
someone just wanted to be noticed Thank
You flow plane chat love it you guys
Rock
yeah buddy Wally says return of channel
super-fun and I think the timestamp from
that was probably around the time we
were talking about doing game streams
and stuff yeah I could see that
happening all right so let's walk
through how we need to alter the RGB
setup in this rig in order to make it
work for our light loop fans which are
so first we need our commander Pro
because it's got all them RGB channels
then we need our lighting node Pro kit
here so this has all of our individually
addressable RGB strips Corsair really
does put more Rd money into RGB then
probably the GDP of some very small
nations they like really give many cares
about it so basically we've got four of
these which we can string them all
together there you go that's well within
the limit of how many individually
addressable RGB LEDs you can have on a
single channel for the lighting node Pro
or excuse me for the commander Pro then
in the lighting node we've got this
little hub doodad right here which I
believe we don't actually have to swap
out I believe we can still use the
that's included in the case ah yes
yeah I think we don't have to use that
and then we've also got these extensions
that we use to string these together and
plug them into our commander and then
we've also got this USB connection which
again I don't think we need because it's
pre-wired in the case and finally we've
got another this is a male female this
is two male two males so these are
extensions these are two male two mates
so I just want to double check my
references yeah so we can take the whole
thing out got it okay thank you Jake
needs me going over there and checking
so never mind we can remove all of this
stuff and we swap it all out with the
commander Pro and what's good about the
commander Pro is it does both fan
control and RGB lighting that's right
little rusty it was so long ago that I
actually did the original very quickly
actually forgotten a lot of it okay so
that means we can also pull out this RGB
hub so if you look at this we're gonna
end up putting it back in but it's gonna
be on top of the commander Pro here and
it'll wire up all of our all of our fans
all right don't trip don't trip Andy
okay so I'm just gonna pop this out
oh man the adhesive they use on these
things oh never mind it came off real
easy this time must be the warmer
weather remember how hard it was to
remove them last time
hey it was pretty hard to remove all
right do you guys need a pair of side
cutters I did but I have an extra pair
here if you need it I would like to have
that one back at some point though
because I don't have like another
another one so this thing's ba check
this up so there's our there we go
so these LED channels can go out to a
hob like this one see that so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna stick that to
there boom and then there we go so then
this puppy goes here and that goes into
one of my LED channels there and then
this access kind of like a hub for one
of these pretty good stuff and then of
course it can do it's six fans and oh
that's neat so it also acts as a USB
kind of hub as well so you've got one
USB internal header here a lot of modern
motherboards don't have a ton of USB 2
headers so you can take this plug it
into one of them and then you get two
out of it so that allows you to plug in
like if you've got you know an RGB CPU
cooler or something like that if you
just got a bunch of stuff that needs an
internal header this allows you to split
it and then finally you've got the four
temp sensors so this puppy
right here by the power supply and then
I'm gonna stick it down once I've got
everything wired up are you gonna check
into something I guess if we're using
the commander Pro oh well what's this
one do we need it okay so you take your
commander Pro yeah and you take LED
channel one and you plug that into your
hub so that allows you to take just this
one LED thing here and consider all four
of your fans with it otherwise be let me
have what - oh and we need the other one
then for our four RGB strips that go
around the windowed side of the case
strips guys make sure that you're not
cross pollinating here try to use your
box as your as your staging area for
soon as I say not as I do mister just
look at me I don't know what to tell you
okay so what we need to do is we need to
look at that and see okay does this a
mess I don't understand that no table
manners you just pull it out and then
yeah it's a little tricky it's a little
okay it's a little tricky so sassy trace
all the wires
I'm gonna have to chase these back at
some point
come do exactly the same in your doing
I'm just sizing it up right now you put
it on top right Tess what are you doing
explain waiting for Anthony why are you
always waiting for Anthony just go for
it I haven't used this Wow no you're not
Dennis on I could have been more usable
Oh somewhere I think that's the only
piece of day I actually feel successful
okay you did you probably tape it
already
you got tape that down goes as far over
as you can go well
oh so this site pacing yeah so that's
this basis camera person I'm so sorry it
has a name if you make a parody of it I
mean it's kind of a joke of performance
oh yeah bazinga yeah I is the sort of -
I am magnificent we having trouble I'm
gonna be done before everybody else it's
nice to me to say Colton about it's like
a prime Oh No yeah I was gonna say are
you worried alex is gonna do too good of
a job and make you look bad so because
he's never done it he's gonna do too
good of a job and make you laugh
all right I love the hardware that they
include with these AIO coolers it's just
like it's like they want new users to be
afraid you know it's great here's a
zillion screws go ham honestly though if
you have experience with that it's not a
big deal so I just need everybody so I
just need this little bracket on here
for AMD whoops oh there goes some of my
thermal compound dang it it's more a
question of just like how many hands do
they expect you to have once you know
how it goes together that on there and
then now here you go guys here's the AIO
installation we managed to get the
little girl right-side up that's pretty
sick always love it when it works
what and you just hook these on like
this see that can you see that Andy put
that in like that
yeah easy peasy lemon squeezy I really
don't like it as much as the Intel mount
to be very clear I don't like these
plastic brackets and I'm ashamed of
doing poppers blue board
there's nothing I can do about it I'm
just giving the I'm just giving the
cooler a little bit of a twist a little
bit of a squish here so I can spread up
that thermal compound that I scratch now
it should be fine
so now I just need to grab eight of
these screws for my fans we're not doing
a push-pull configuration or anything
like that so that's all I need and then
I can through the rest of them my baby
and put them back in the box here these
are all just hardware for other sockets
and it's like it's one of those things
where one of the most stressful things I
think for new users is leftover parts
you know once they're done assembling
something well that's okay with an AI oh
you end up with a lot of leftover parts
so that if we ever had to install these
on a different socket we would have the
parts that we need nice 20 new thermal
paste it's not ideal but yeah it's fine
all right
yeah I was trying to take the thing off
and then I just kind of there's a fair
bit of thermal compound on the bottom of
these it'll ill spread out all right all
right I'm honestly kind of falling
behind here because I'm spending so much
time sort of thinking about posting a
video and not enough time focusing on
computer I might be one of the last ones
done which we know you need to help me
really embarrassing what I just got here
all the FS ramming him done - I was
hoping you were gonna finish first I'm
gonna help me catch up oh yeah but yeah
Anthony is probably I'll be the first
one you're not gonna be the first one
done Dennis to count s first one
I can tell you for one thing how tight
do it like is it like this finger tight
it'll feel like it starts to get a lot
more resistance will be much higher no
it's actually pretty I think it's easier
than stopping perfect for AMD's Wow
please crucify Eddie yeah just my fans
out there just obliterate his Twitter
what is your Twitter Yago just go roast
the crap out of him because he doesn't
like AMD okay I actually really like it
uh-huh
now he's backpedaling are you one of
those guys that's like I like AMD
because they forced pricing down on the
Intel CPUs I buy is that where you're
going with that get back to their xp
days but I can be really cheap and
overclocked really high I would make the
argument that they're already back to
the Athlon XP days cuz like Athlon XP
they were like okay I'm talking later
days like bartering for half the next
week they were like good enough like
almost as good but if we're speaking
honestly unless you're an AMD fanboy not
as good but they were definitely cheaper
and you could overclock them a little
bit and get a little bit of extra
performance it was until Apple on 60
they really took the performance crown
so then two could be the Athlon 64 nine
but we're already at the XP don't look
at me Ani this is too much pressure
guys now is the time if you haven't
already to double check the IO of your
motherboard and make sure that none of
the tabs on the back of the i/o shield
are sticking into your slots what ok I
think I actually bump that up on this
one it's really easy to screw up on this
particular board do you have one that
stuck how do you whine crap you guys
both have these throw oh yeah so guys
please double check that and when you're
putting it back in if you did mess it up
make sure you bend back then back the
tabs and locking it before you do it
again
we're gonna use James Dean to hand I got
as an example here I'm just gonna turn
around so and you can see basically some
on some other boards the manufacturer
leaves these tabs kind of flat like this
so what happens is you slide your board
in and you see that the port's actually
covered or it'll have a metal tab stuck
in it which can short out and it can
actually destroy the port so you need to
make sure that you bend these back yes
is that one day individuals need one
more those are mine I think like a chain
one yeah that's got four on it already
got four this guy right there okay nope
that's a molex to SATA adapter you
should have one it's funny yeah you guys
would assume that just because people
work here they build computers like all
the time but it doesn't actually work
that way so James has actually done the
preparation for our build guides before
did an amazing job but the thing is that
and you guys would never know that it
was prepared by someone who actually had
to do some research in order to make it
happen but the thing is that he mostly
focuses on our consumer electronics
videos so yeah like a PC build is not
necessarily the kind of thing that he
does every weekend so he has to like
look things up sometimes that's
something I think a lot of people don't
realize about our jobs is that there's a
lot of kind of researching things as it
becomes time to make a video about for
all of us actually even if you've done
it before
like I will become an expert on juicing
or variable refresh we all know
everything about it it's like cramming
for an exam the script is over it's gone
I come back six months later I have to
research a lot of the stuff again yeah
to get the real details because like
even the best-case scenario everyone on
our writing team is producing one video
per week that is over 50 a year exactly
50 if they take two weeks off it's a lot
usually you don't do one video
it really depends it depends on how much
other people have blown their weight I
think fun times when you just totally
forget something and you like how does
that work and then you're like wait a
second I literally made like the
resource for this and you go back and
watch your own video your own script so
we're having issues with the i/o here
I'm just not doing it right
so what is it like the paint like who's
the type-c is really particularly about
I think it's right have Alex check
headaches but that's I think I had the
same problem with my PC at home and I
was just like I can plug things into it
I'm good which is terrible it's not good
it's on mine here where the things just
bend the wrong way and he just gets old
bulgy so yeah that used to be fixed
we've almost got the motherboard out
here so I told the SP only opens like
two of the boxes properly
well we okay we open them all to put
inventory tags on them but we only use
two of them so uh I'm really sorry NIC
and Gary and Advent we love you guys and
we're really sorry thank you
yeah that's a fishel official LMG stance
right there a suit some love in the chat
guys and maybe like we doubt them and be
like Linus the story I'm sorry I'm sorry
Asus you made them send them back so
yeah you have to say sorry - yeah sorry
guys
so sorry for your sorry yeah in our
defense we had we had said - one in
1440p mug did right and we're being like
choosing beggars at that point we should
be sorry for that
- we're just sorry in general we are
sorry
so Andy do you want to go over there so
does that switch to my mic to them
it's a white round
so I'm not offended out of the way yeah
and then you everything else is fine
it's just that one on you to all of you
there's people on Twitch and low
pressure or anything guys do a good job
with everyone see how everyone's doing
sure oh I guess you're starting with me
okay so I've got my motherboard
installed I've got my I left my front
fans in cuz those ones were fine in my
case Colton's was like one of them now
was in the wrong spot apparently so
that's kind of desire I've got my m2 and
my ramen I've got my CPU cooler mounted
to the motherboard not actually
installed yet I have to go get some side
covers for James apparently David's got
him I've got my power supply in I've got
my motherboard IO shield correctly
installed and I have wired up my fan hub
to my commander Crowe and I'm gonna be
ready to install it probably pretty soon
once I get that cooler in I'm ready to
flip this up and then I can start really
wiring things up so that's where I'm at
I would say I'm about 65% done just
because the RGB wiring takes so freakin
long it took a really long time last
time honestly the RGB wiring was a big
part of the reason that we haven't
tackled this project yet because we were
worried that these systems were going to
be too advanced for novices to build and
then
you were just like well we need to play
video games tonight so I guess we're
just doing it that that's how that's how
it went down oh man I'm just uh I'm just
trying to play catch-up here I was doing
tech link Riley asked me to host so me
and Riley were occupied doing that even
though we're both were supposed to be in
here billing so all I've got so far is
my CPU my RAM and my MDOT two in there
motherboard is still outside of the case
I got my PSU house and the first thing
plugged into it which is the 24 pin
connector for the CPU
wish me luck we're gonna make it we're
gonna play some games built the last
desk so I had to take out my motherboard
to fix my i/o so I've kind of taken a
few steps back fortunately I have done
full RGB actually using a similar stuff
I was using a corsair 1000d so it had a
lot more room but it's essentially the
same I have faith like I know what I am
doing we're all in this together guys
until the games started then there's two
teams
oh gosh oh this is a computer I'm doing
my best trying to learn and surrounded
by people I know so much and its
excellence this competition that isn't
here I want to win it around here I
can't believe her all of these are TV
things I'm like pretty close I haven't
done any wiring though which is gonna be
that's gonna bite me in the butt I hate
these my next build is all knocked to a
no lights anyway so I've got LED RGB
stripe on all connect together routing
all the cable to the back and now I'm
just showing I guess at this point you
could look at installing your
motherboard but have you been have you
connected anything up to your I have an
atom and nothing nyeh
okay so you don't want to connect with
the band slows though is that big
control the fan is controlled here the
fan plugs into the lighting now okay
commander Pro story okay and then what
plug into this thing goes to the yes
which we can route hi
yeah we did we are very close to done I
give 30% okay what what is this for what
is this cable for and the anchor this
was this escape this mini-usb no this is
the one with the bound of cable in the
case the node that we took out so that
can go into the so you've already got
one plugged into it yeah you can take
that out but this one I already have to
defend this worse than this one
yeah so you can just
take it out and just use that what's
what's gone into this so me and Alex
kind of took a different route we didn't
take Linus's advice to do all of the RGB
lighting stuff first so we instead got
our motherboard in we got our RAM we've
got our a i/o mounted I think you've got
actually your plate you got this
actually fully mounted yeah yeah you're
really close and yeah and then after
this it's pretty much just the lighting
strips and then and then cabling cabling
and then graphics card right yeah and
then connect everything which is gonna
take like longer than everything else
combined just do it for dirty we could
have them running
yeah this is the kind of time where it
just makes me want to go to get old
dildo newfoundland and slam some beers
that's a really quite a tradition back
back in the newfoundland anyway yeah
dildo no has a brewery I'm trying to win
sorry I'm trying to learn how to
actually for the South Seas I can tell
what things then the screws for they may
be in here so what you want to do oh I
was just gonna show you great yeah
thanks dude you know how to like loop it
beforehand and then stick it on right
alright so I'm actually starting to come
together here so I just finished up my
front panel I oh so there's my front
audio there's my front usb3 all my front
buttons so that's my power my reset my
power LED and all that good stuff so now
what I need to do is take my fans here
and wire them around to the back that's
how we're gonna keep everything really
clean because I'm certainly not cable
managing the back of the motherboard
tray nicely and then I'm gonna take my
rule let me see oh that's right okay so
this allows us to use our cooler as an
RGB controller but we don't need to do
that because we have a commander Pro so
I'm just gonna go ahead and run this
around back and those probably get rid
of it yeah we don't need that man okay
you're gonna have to pull that out the
friken finish doing cable management
here pain that's okay I can put it back
in later I suspect we're not gonna
bother putting all the hard drives in
these now
actually we've got all those refurbished
3 terabytes from our old server ok I
guess we don't really have to fine fine
fine fine is America oh how many screws
do you need to take this thing out oh I
hope you don't have to take one out from
the other side
oh no there it is there's a thumb screw
back here yep I see it
no I Bram I see to power beforehand I
just need to deal with my RGB eye
cabling for my CPU cooler
yep all right so this guy is gonna come
over here above my 8 pin and then back
here and now that's out of the way you
can actually see over here on the
example system they're just like chillin
here because we don't need them because
of the node Pro so yeah so I just did
that and then now I'm gonna go ahead and
I'm gonna run my USB so my USB 2 over
here and this is gonna go back to the
hub that's built into the node Pro so
that's gonna go back there like that oh
man I got want to run all these together
and right now they're kind of a mess
actually so I'm gonna undo my 8 pin for
the motherboard I'm gonna put all these
up here right and then I'm gonna put it
back in there we go so this is you know
Jenk clean cable management right you
get you get everything just kind of run
over to the back and then it looks clean
from the front and nothing else matters
right right
I don't know yeah thanks dance cable
meddigan bowling your hire doesn't
writer alright so there it is that's all
the RGB and fan control wiring also
power for my CPU cooler man-made CPU
coolers have gotten complicated they
have like five or six wire things coming
into them tour for actually that's no my
point still stands all right so now I
just have to deal with the back oh
actually no I'm gonna run my I'm gonna
run my RGB strips first so I need to
just have how I ran these which way I
win I guess I have to get it which way I
went around looks like Malins yeah so it
goes in here and then it's female end
alright so here's how we're wiring them
in I actually like steel cases for RGB
lighting because some strips have
magnets on them like this one and boom
you just stick them in like that and
then you never have to worry about the
adhesive coming off so I can go ahead
and wire up my next one I'm just gonna
do a little like Chris City cross-city
thing here that'll take up the slack and
hide it run that down this side
there we go okay so those two are in now
go ahead and wire up another one it's
gonna be so much RG being here my
friends I got one more here I just have
to remember it's the top one that wears
up to the back there we go so now we
need to take one of these wires cables I
guess it's a technically a cable and
yeah so that's a male to male RGB
connector do that this was where I got
confused last time okay
it's the male one yes it's the wait what
so it's an extension one that goes into
the top yes
it's an extension so it's a male to
female and then that goes into yes
that's how it works so what is this one
for all right I think this one goes from
the hub to the commander Pro all right
that's where I got confused
okay good have to nail the female in
there and then we can run that over to
the other side above the fans noodle
right this was the heart that I have
thought maybe I should do at the
beginning of the building this is some
advanced cable management techniques
done here so right now I'm trying to
fish this so I'm gonna pre kink though
I'm gonna free kink it so that I can get
around this radiator here there we go
and then I'm gonna push it down there we
go
and then I'm gonna pull it through here
with ideally needlenose this in which
case I would have it already or failing
that my fingers and there it is so now I
just need another extension and I can go
ahead and plug that into there we are my
controller here so that's gonna be
channel - there we are nice getting that
RGB wired up okay now we get to deal
with the fans these are a bit of a
nightmare
man come on so many wires coming out of
these fins okay so this is power for our
this is fan power off the CPU cooler so
that we could power its fans are not
going to and then these good so these
are fan control for our CPU cooler you
know actually yeah but how did we do it
last time cuz we should do them all the
same ideally we did we did go into the
commander last time okay okay so these
two fans here are gonna go into our
commander Pro on channels 1 &amp;amp; 2 doesn't
really matter what channel to go on cuz
we can kind of dink around with it later
it matters far more when you're deciding
which channel which where you plug the
RGB headers into so first though we're
gonna take all our power from our flint
fans and we're gonna plug those into
channels 3 &amp;amp; 4 and then that's all our
system fans now so those are all gonna
be controlled by software through this
USB header here that I'm gonna have to
plug in at some point and then here we
go so here's our RGB leads for the tops
and here's our RGB leads for the whoops
nope
here RGB man well worth it right okay so
here our RGB leads for all of them but
we can't put these in willy-nilly
because we need to know if we want to
have animations run from one to the
other or anything like that then they've
got to be plugged in in a specific order
so I have to go check the reference
machine now and figure out exactly how I
did this last and then I guess I should
probably communicate that to everyone
so first things first we need to find
the RGB lead from a fan that we can
easily identify which one it is so why
don't we go where I'm gonna undo this
twist I gear because I really need to
trace this wire back to where it came
from these two are coming off my bottom
fan it's hard to tell which one's power
and which one this RGB though I have
another cable of tie in here who would
have thought this was to cable manage
all right so here's my bottom fan again
to be powered yeah that's been hard so
this one's RGV okay so that is channel
one okay so guys okay need everyone's
attention real quick here so your bottom
fan on the front of the case goes into
port one of your RGB hub okay two two
three four okay cool so now I can take
all these and trace them back to the
fans that they came from so this is
gonna go into one something like that
this is gonna build into two yes the RGB
strips all daisy chain there's a line
here and your stuff is going over it
like this this could be closer to my
space can we just maybe put this in the
box you had this elaborate system
did I even put that there how did you
you put that there
throwing me under the bus Andy throwing
me under the bus
thank you okay so for better for worse
my RGB is where dub looks like an
octopus
but hey what can you do it's not
possible for one of the systems to not
have our GD colton that the the watchers
of our stream here paid good money to
see us struggling with it
oh speaking of paying good money for the
stream super chats the CUDA says is that
an LT t chair yes it was a Mac sonic
tear with LTTE embroidery oh she's
pretty sick Juan says what's up gamers
tree said - please stop yelling at
everyone and being rude
yeah I'm trying to help Harley says how
much for one of these I have a p4 with
three gigs of RAM ouch
225 perfect sense you guys should send
Lewis one of these chairs he's broken
I'm not would you she'll thrill TT I
don't know man big boss says guys check
out my unfortunately not I don't know
how that will help other people yeah I
San Diego man you're excited you see you
outside a seat yes a belt yes oh okay
apparently they're coming up that's
pretty cool Raymond says any update on
potential sponsors for backyard Wars
actually I don't know
hey Colton do we have an update for a
scrapyard war sponsor no not yet oh okay
look a mature to that never mind
I thought we I thought we had locked in
but we're broke we're doing scrap you're
worse regardless oh yeah okay so there's
the the update ladies and gentlemen
who's here yeah later this year so stay
tuned actually finishing the land center
is a key part of scrapyard wars for this
year because the challenge is going to
be 3v3 gaming setups you have to do the
whole setup desk chair monitor
everything and what no I think I've told
them this ticket so far already
okay so 3v3 gaming setups and then it's
instead of coming down to benchmarks
it's gonna come down to who wins a
tournament so whoever has the best rings
should theoretically have a significant
advantage
they'll also just have to like be kind
of decent though so I'll see how that
goes so we're gonna use the land center
right that's how that figures into it
we're gonna use the land center to
balance the teams and make sure that
they're pretty close before we before we
split off into teams so cuz everyone's
gonna be running on the same hardware
here in the land center for the
commander
and then I've got all the same tower
over here that needs to get plugged in
at some point
I heard the shade I was ignoring the
shade
I uh I'm not I'm not acknowledging the
shade because I don't have to
are you wiring up are you doing your
cable management or something ethany
yeah he it's not that easy in these
small cases now you're gonna have to
wait till we order food tonight and you
ignored actually what time is this
hormone it's 400 I don't think we are I
guess we'll have to do it next week
without James and I were supposed to
shoot a video on the 100 terabyte laptop
because I'm not even done let alone like
Dennis now I'm no updates because I'm in
doing the same thing I I'm watching that
is I'm watching live stream in life okay
watching my Anthony still okay I did say
that you should try and tidy up your
wires I mean that do line is this way
okay well if you're gonna do a live this
way you can start installing your
motherboard motherboard wait I thought
you'd do that what that pulled up the
top thing yes
oh yeah Oh Oh graphics card I can
do graphics car right oh no that goes
after those things I've got everything
then oh no I
Oh put it on now yeah oh I thought you
had to go with radiator so we can do
motherboard now so first thing you have
to have to put this down you should
probably like what I said earlier
thank you talking to this probably what
I would just put it through the case
first case so would I go on the back
what
Susie I'm probably the most busy a most
important person here at Philippi lots
of important stuff to do we saved you
one where is it on the floor yeah all
right so I'm going to put this thing in
to this I guess people think this my
piece is not gonna work
I can tell you you are wrong because you
will work whose get wait
would I get is true for the mother boy
in the king or this will actually one
second once I have and you do more I
need a high more table yeah yours
hanging - okay okay the height that the
others I know cooler bracket on so this
where's my spatula
how do I do this and then you put it in
right I'm working on our GB so is Colton
we're trying to figure out where exactly
it goes it's bad at you yeah yeah it's
just like actually like moving all of
the cables to make everything work now
but I've never actually wired a RGB
lighting hub before so this is new for
me yeah yeah why are lots of RTV before
whenever one of these guys so yeah cool
it seems like it's easy
okay so I am I doing that first yes
before what the motherboard in them I
got a peel for you I gotta peel wait
hold on I gotta actually wait hold on oh
I know I got okay ready
ready ready it's a bad peel but fast
quick this quick well so I'm actually
getting pretty darn close here oh my god
what happened what did you do the
classic came off of this cooler and then
it's smeared all over this table that
there are no paces in this warm we need
some isopropyl stat and I'm gonna use
this plastic bag it just you know this
is kind of like the recycled condom joke
in the row so I'm just gonna put this
back over it
hopefully that keeps their whole case
from getting onto this table it looks no
it doesn't look that nice it's just
objectively bad it's it's not good are
you like getting close I'm like pretty
much it's a shame
I got GPU and Network hard on this bad
girl here yeah look at him he's just
ignoring doing fantastic famously
fantastic that's not true once once pots
already gone I know it's hard to get all
angles think so pal you need some
scratchiness
lucky number nine not many people know
this the most important part of a PC is
the processor B 501 one that's your CPA
who says the heart of your PC is your
power supply let's go see sonic isn't it
remember the Prime 1000 titanium this is
an excellent power supply you should
probably buy one they got s effects
power supplies if you got a smaller bill
than this you got a video featuring
those coming out soon so check them out
it's probably a link in the description
right kaldane and you just got a sip
them up you know just sip sip what
that's it you can you can look away now
so I'm getting real close over here all
I've got to do is put in my GPU and this
work card I've actually got I think
everything else wired up yeah this is
not an ideal box opener but ah this is
always the most fun part you know what
nope I'm making myself wait I'm gonna do
my network card first so these are the
like gaming version of their 10 gig Nick
and I remember asking them I was like
whoa so what's the difference between
the gaming and the non-gaming version
because I think most of us know that
your your Nick is not a huge factor when
it comes to gaming and they were let go
well the gaming one has a slightly more
expensive black PCB so it cost a bit
more and I was like oh what a
refreshingly honest answer that's
tremendous yeah love that love that real
marketing you know just being real about
it so Jake who's gonna be first me or
you you're done all right we'll do you
wonder what the prizes nothing there's
there's actually a prize Jake I have
something for you okay stay away from me
for being first I have to help other
people you have to do system number two
which we didn't assign anyone to what
ah at this time know what a tremendous
please don't make me do this actually
yeah do you want to image machine one
minute that's also a bit of a hassle
it's better than building in this case
again I built my personal rigging this
twice now and then once for work so this
is that would be my fifth build if I did
another one in this case well then
actually it sounds like you should
probably do that cuz I'm most
experienced okay take your on machinery
dammit we're gonna get Anthony to do the
imaging thing or actually we should Lisa
it's probably not even gonna be faster I
think we need the image you want to do
the image certain spelling windows some
things it doesn't take that long yeah
yeah we don't uh I don't know it might
be the thing about imaging them though
is they're MDOT too so it's gonna be a
bit of a hassle it's not like we can
plug in ten drives an image though so
you don't we're doing Windows Riley very
funny
alright alright you guys settle down
settle down so there's our 10 gig Nick
and then now I get to put the last piece
into my system super excite oh not quite
I have my SATA cables that I wanted to
run as courtesy connectors to my hard
drive bays up there GPU time these are
super weird cards so I remembered when I
was doing the unboxing or when I was
dividing everything up earlier that
there was something about the cooler and
so I was trying to remember so I kind of
stuttered while I was being like that
did you do laughs an or something right
I remember what's exceptional about this
thing
the cooler is freaking massive so this
isn't even like a Strix or like an rog
card or anything like that
but it's got this
Oh thick dual fan cooler on it that
takes up three slots and is like just a
hunk it's just a giant hunk of metal
unreal so it's super quiet that's what I
remember being exceptional about it back
when we did the first machine so we're
gonna go ahead we're gonna pop that over
there we're gonna pop that graphics card
right in there and then we can go ahead
and close up this box and the piece just
gotta get this aligned properly and that
should be on there oh so um where did
Matthias go yeah well I was gonna get
him to go get the monitors when he
finished getting to them no he'll come
back he'll come back it's okay yeah all
right so I actually kind of lied I still
have one more thing to do here I've got
to find where my extension cables are
for my graphics card and run my power to
my GPU here we go
Oh Matthias were you already getting the
monitors nice alright thank you sir okay
cool so that's in
your likes of the box labeled that's
8-pin - come on that's the what for the
Rays of the moon box inside that word
there's one nice okay and I'm a little
disappointed we actually miscounted how
many builders we needed here
so we're short one system but that's
okay because jake has graciously
volunteered to be the one to put it
together you are a team player Jake let
it never be said that Jake is Jake is a
team player Jake as a team player no I
am being nice I said let it never be
said all of these things yeah don't say
any of them they're ruse
that's how that's how my dad taught me
good language my mom another rose to a
lot of people have requested another one
but I think they don't really realize
that that's not really how that works
you don't like we don't make it like it
just like an annual roasting of me I
think I could take I would actually be
so much less stressed out if I got to be
a roaster for someone else I was so
nervous
either roaster and I was sitting in your
throne man you're exposed it was all the
lights in your face nothing around you
no one's sitting next to you just you on
a chair in the middle of a stage and the
person in all the podium making fun of
you is actually pretty intense so yeah
yeah it was fun I'm not sure I need to
do it again that's my that's my review
of being roasted don't want the
90-degree one to go to the hard drive or
don't want the straight one
six-ten I have a wager huh no not that
kind of wager I have a different wager
what percentage out of conveniently ten
I guess because one of them was already
built and one of them is gonna be done
by Jake later so let's take let's take
the original ten what percentage of
these machines is gonna power on first
time and just work you say all of them
are gonna just work - I say - don't
okay so dole ready go around again
everyone's take I'll go first
oh yeah RGB matters hold on hold on guys
you gotta wait for Andy to come around
so I'm calling three I think three of
them are going to work a hundred percent
right out of the gate and I will I will
further my wager and say that mine will
be one of them there you go nothing just
honor wait yeah he's just gonna buy
pizza regardless oh I'm next
um I think that any person with
RGB wise I gotta go with seven I think
seven will be good I don't think mine is
going to be one of them I think I
screwed up I think nine out of ten will
post there's gonna be one that has like
an issue just like our unseated Ram or
something and two no three out of ten
we'll have our GB that works I don't
remember what I said I think everyone
here has probably done a pretty good job
I think the system of having a really
experienced person with one or two other
people should solve the issue of
building wrong
I think we're all gonna be good ten out
of ten I think two out of ten are
knocking a post and I think six out of
ten are gonna have your working RGB so
two out of ten are knocking a post and
four out of ten are knocking RGB hey
guys this is called the power supply
light has helped me know I don't I'm
fine oh this is stressful I'm just gonna
keep building pretend you're not there
is that that's not good okay great we
might have made a mistake over here
wasn't me why would you help me like
this okay look at this why would you out
me like this this is such an honest
mistake that everyone no one you can
even tell what's wrong right now
everyone's like this is normal
what's up Oh James that's okay he's
right he's right honest mistake
it's an easy thing to do he put the fans
on the outside of the case because this
case has a bit of a like kind of contour
to it yeah so he's gonna need to pull
this cooler off and put the fans on the
inside that's okay that's okay we all
made mistakes I made one I can't
remember what it was
reading no way okay you can finish
getting people tape oh is this about the
computers I have it feeling that only
three computers will have their RGB
working when they first plug them in I
think it will post I think that'd be my
guess
I feel like three are going to be
totally good to go
one of which is gonna be mine which I
think also might be the best-looking one
I haven't seen anyone else but we've got
zip ties over here and probably two are
going to post had questionable luck with
really any AMD processor before they
always work just maybe not the first
time you got the you got this on here
yeah oh okay yeah so yeah go ahead with
the your 101 I've put the fans it's
gonna be kind of weird it doesn't go in
like that
oh no if you look at that one it's
underneath oh yeah but here's the thing
I don't think Jake forgot to put a spam
filter on so actually oh hold on a
minute hold on a minute
so who's actually first Jake
bring it on day badminton fighers ono
the little rubber grommets for my window
note on it they must have come off in
this true James give me what you worship
take anything you need where'd it go
they slipped off in here danged I didn't
even realize until I got to one that did
have the grommet on it you're okay with
this okay that wire should probably go
too
I missed that wire okay I wasn't
actually like this so this is one of my
front panel connectors then I did a
pretty subpar cable management job on so
I'm gonna go ahead and tuck that back
there hanging out with the guys building
PC easy watching other guys build PC
somewhere else build a PC Oh next to me
BOTS
oiled up half-naked guys
all right so we're gonna call that
yeah we're calling that good enough but
I do need to put these rubber things
back on here dang it I that's the
mistake I always make and that's how you
get children I think most and we're
gonna post I think like I know they're
gonna post about the RGB I think those
look like I would say so
Wow RGB man
and II peel time wait Jake have you
peeled you're waiting I already peeled
my top one but I haven't done the friend
yet so I'm I'm doing something that I
usually really recommend against and I
am closing up my side panel before
actually testing it hey Jake have you
labeled your system okay that's a very
very critical step 12
no no need to sign it in blood thank you
all right so that's it oh are you just
writing on it in sharpie Jake I brought
a label maker okay all right so man one
I think is already labeled tool and two
three four I hate this label maker all
right so the reason I'm doing all of
these cuz it wastes so much label every
time Jake I'm printing labels you're
what I'm making one for you too I'm
making a nice one make thin uniform day
you're killing me here
come on really
it does not look nice how many 12 did
you make anyway so I just did one like
this with all of them oh I see and then
we can print as many copies of this okay
who keeps setting this to have a long
tail on the end of it why would anybody
do that I don't think anyone would
intentionally do that just no one knows
how to use that thing
yeah its margin here not full margin
narrow margin never set it to full
margin thank you ladies and gentlemen
drives me crazy I swear people all right
so I'm Lam three so I'm gonna go ahead
and uh who has all and - oh that's gonna
be Jake Jake you can have land - here 12
I know but you're also land too remember
oh you have to give me those yeah there
you go here's land 12 if you can put
this on your case that would be swell
all right
uh okay I'm gonna do lamb three roll
here so the idea is that we're gonna
label everything that goes in the land
center so that people don't steal it for
like a shoot or a project or whatever
else there it is clean all right news
number four someone should be number
four James what did you you're number
four here's your label I am Number Four
all right there
all right is number five okay where am I
good orient myself this is the top four
baby Wow Dennis you are really far
behind well I'm done
do you have your RGB yes no it just says
LAN nine who's ten oh he's getting food
Oh does he have to like go away for are
getting delivered okay Wow
the food's coming so earlier we had
lunch who's got eleven eleven eleven
Dennis okay here you are
yeah okay okay so here's the plan
Jake is setting up a test station over
there where we are going to take the
finished machines set them up with a
monitor make sure they actually post
check their RGB and wiring and
everything solving those and then seal
them up for good so that's our that's
our current plan what I need to do
though is I'm going to go ahead and box
up in the accessories that I have left
over for my bulb here Junkin packaging
and although here I think I got
everything I think I'm good I'm kind of
afraid to be that confident but yeah I
think I'm gonna unbox my my keyboard and
mouse and everything now so do you want
people to bring their peripherals over
to that station or should I start
setting up peripherals on tables that
are not needed wait right because this
is you know what I could also do though
actually I could go around and I could
label the seats so that could work and
you can and then I can put the right
peripherals in the right spot on the
chairs on the chairs chairs and we're
labeling the chairs - yeah not thinking
the desk that way when we rearrange
everything it'll kind of
sorry I meant label the yeah Matthias
did you bring over all the monitors well
they're nice okay so this is gonna be
seeds three and four then where is this
it check it up windows drive first I
think we just try it ah full RGB heck
yeah look at that rainbow whoo that is
just gorgeous
it's risin you never know DisplayPort so
one one of twelve or one of eleven
because our twelfth one already works
right we're number one already works so
one in twelve are functioning you CPU
installed enter set up I don't have a
keyboard cool
bazinga I need my keyboard yeah you
might as well do that so what number is
yours Jake
yeah just print like a ton of land wall
ah well actually I was thinking I just
printed ton of nobody else is ready it
would be easier for me if he gave me a
bunch of land twelve
well we'll need keyboard and mouse
keyboard mouse webcam monitor headset we
already like our the actual desk sure
desk that's seven okay so I'll give like
five more for now will do not I want to
give you this okay and I need like a
garbage can because I'm gonna have
labels type-c dongles right because if
you don't have enough USB ports that's
annoying
they're already labeled are they yeah
okay cool
hey you gonna be in the back it's fine
this is great oh we need like labels for
the dongles and sir oh yeah those are
different
you mean that's so hard on yourself I
did not choose something number four
like then you can go here sir yes oh
yeah that would have been better I have
to chop this all of it that like three
times yeah that would have been better
it's done now hey lovey I caught this
alright so here we go I'm gonna make I'm
making 13 piles scrap one oh boy - oh
boy three this is gonna take a long time
before no I got this I got this
bye
Oh what time winds Rancho what time is
it 20 minutes it's 4:40 - right now 1 oh
I'm I'm I'm gonna go I'm gonna go no no
we got to do Rancho we got to do Rancho
on time just make this win show sorry
guys this is when show now new Rancho
new and improved yeah I know we are
gonna have to bail on this at some point
here maybe we'll just do like we'll just
stream all day right so we'll just do an
after party after this and finish it off
so we'll come check in with you guys
after a win show does that sound cool is
everyone not everyone watching the
stream cool with that hope so I should
probably do some super chats before we
wrap this that system is working perfect
real close let them see so we got both
sticks of RAM we got 8 gigs and 8 gigs
for total 16 we got our pump is pumping
our 10 gig nick is functional we could
see we could boot from it we're not
going to do that and we have our SSD so
everything is perfecto and I just need a
boot so I'm gonna go get that my box got
for what I have no did someone did
someone not have RAM really dear breath
does anybody not have random their
computer and they realize it so now
what's this about I mean it's really
great but I need to I need to get some
instructions Linus yeah there's a cord
going into the fan and there's a cord
coming out they both come out yeah
gotcha okay that's all that explains
everything
oh there oh I was using this to open the
boxes because I couldn't find I need to
win this otherwise oh wait oh I think
I'm behind
hey I'm just trying to route some cables
in a nice way after the fact so I
probably should have thought about this
first but never having to use this
cooler before many issues occur okay I
have the cooler okay you know I don't
know go all the way back right with one
to the motherboard right one what are
you looking at reading this yeah so all
of these go back this is why I'm so far
behind
I'm not blaming you I'm just saying that
like every time I had to like break my
concentration it's tough to teach and do
at the same time I'm not doing a very
good job teaching okay go all the way
back and talking to the big one yes
those are fans does it need to be like
check minuses yeah I am basically done I
just wanted to look kind of acceptable
before closing it up so we've got like
you know some zip ties this comes along
the back kinda nice it's gonna be a mess
still but it's gonna be less of a mess
just the GPU and we're good to go
now I just need your mouth this bad yes
now do you know how
I cannot know how okay well there are it
doesn't just stick on there is a you
have the bag of screws that came with
the cooler okay so what you want is -
yes so this goes in the bottom and hooks
on to the the hooks that are on the
motherboard
so just okay so what you can do should
we start it off
put the hook down on the bottom and
screw that a little bit okay and do the
same thing on the other side then you
hook them in and your thing just screw
it down
yes and I have a new lease on life
so Dave and I just had lunch we hadn't
had lunch today I'm like Donald is over
that you haven't had lunch yet candy
here you go well there you go Andy so
now I have to catch up because I would
weaken to reach gotta eat yeah normally
you don't eat
Mayo and I'm supposed to have the
extension first you can put it in there
but yeah my piles you ruined my piles
it's okay they're not you get a shot of
the piles I can't see without my files
okay so I'm labeling all the land
freezes the reference system yes system
wise why what about it yeah number one
yeah I get it but look at this come here
this is the reference system this is
what we're supposed to keep aspire
towards it's spaghetti
it's forget and do you not like
spaghetti sir I love spaghetti
exactly that's a lie spaghetti but this
is not the normal color that I'm used to
that's the you know I realized I
realized now why I've been having
trouble with this because I'm a simple
man you know give me some normal
components I'll slap those together even
by normal oh dang you're right take a
hike I need to reframe my my question
Oh what are you we're the cooler this
thing that's good possibly yeah this
going to Mazda nah know that positive
what that one no this the small one that
comes off that one goes to the
motherboard where the CPU cooler just
above the CPU cooler I believe they're
okay at least mine is pretty neat and
tidy on the inside that's all that
matters really
so I am just applying all my little
labels here so this way we'll know if
anyone steals a component where it came
from there we go lam 3c Landry Landry go
ahead and put that there still gotta do
my microphone and I'm not going to
bother with the pad or should I but no I
shouldn't
the plan was to have hard drives in the
systems but we didn't get hard drives so
that's where we're at on that yep
all right so I'm gonna do my pro
Wireless here actually I think I got
exactly the right number of leaders no
I'm one short shoot on one short cuz I
wanted one for the actual spot on the
desk man three gorgeous power that on
before I get confused and then I also
need to there's no dongle in this mouse
why is there not a dongle in this mouse
oh okay
oh man
I was freaking out there guys freaking
out ladies and gentlemen I'm chill I'm
relaxed yeah guys that's not a thing so
okay can you buy them $15 okay so
there's my dongle I'm gonna need to do
up a smaller label for that right now
I'm just gonna throw that in the mouse
so that it's safe grab your labels here
oh oh oh you actually like did it it's
probably fine it's probably gone oh guy
right you do a good job
no not I'm not doubting him or anything
I'm just asking I'm just asking
questions yeah don't go right into the
PCs dongles into the monitors is
probably fine too okay no but we're
getting a different monitor right which
it might have
let's just plug it into the diary fine
you can see where did we decide we were
putting the labels on the headphones
outside or inside okay I'm gonna do it
on the yeah okay you're right okay I'm
gonna put a visible dongle adapter in
the box yeah I left mine in there I
didn't grab the cable out of the box how
much does that matter
need the cable
I'm just tidying up back soon time to
actually write the next thing I'm gonna
do is a shirt that's right oh my god we
should have that here feed you now Andy
here you go here you go Andy when you
label all your peripherals I have done
reference peripherals over on my desk
for where we're going to put all the
labels so please do it exactly the same
way except maybe align them a little
better and that happens to be in exactly
the same spot yeah I put it on the label
that's already there don't forget to do
the wrist rest yeah we only need that I
think one more though
I oh I was just gonna plug it in wired
why do you USB for that all right
oh wait they're not all the same is the
pro is controllers
yeah this isn't Wireless hey my son lady
missing something here yep nope
so yeah there you go this one doesn't
have one so close I just need to put
land 3 on the front of the desk here and
then I'm good
yeah I was gonna put it on the edge no I
want it to be immediately visible it
hurts the aesthetics a little but not
that
it should be like five and a four five
pins and important yeah so the five pins
at the top pin the top which one is that
reset switch yeah that's bottom right
because they're kind of in the whales
alright so all the mics that we have
aren't actually gonna sit on the Jets
we're gonna have like a shelf over there
somewhere and you would just go pick it
up if you want to use it and plug it in
and then you can start screaming because
they're kind of in the way otherwise I'm
trying to take a webcam out of here this
is the sweet Logitech Rio 4k oh look at
that peel gorgeous so it is genuinely
for a webcam like surprisingly good
baller and like as a streamer it allows
you to punch in
are you Johnny ready and when you're
streaming with Logitech Brio 4k because
it's added resolution you can punch in
like 4 times and it's still 1080p you
know you're doing screaming things maybe
you set that up on your stream deck to
again that's a fresh install that
doesn't sound good
maybe that's like a that's an expensive
one that's like a 512 gate okay guys um
couple things first of all everyone
watching the stream thank you for
bearing with us as we've struggled
through building these machines some of
us are done some of us are going to
continue to struggle a little longer
though
while we do bansho so I have to go do an
show but also an announcement for you
guys uh you need to put labels on all
the peripherals and everything that go
with your computer as well as the back
of your tower itself and the seat where
your station will ultimately be so this
is LAN 3 already which means that this
is gonna be 4 so whoever's 4 you're here
all of your labels are here in a pile
there are gonna be some things you can't
label if you have a really small
wireless receiver dongle for example
like the one in the G Pro wireless
you're gonna need to use the paint pen
that jake has to write LAN whatever
number it is we don't want to get let
these get lost because they're expensive
to replace if we can find them at all
everybody cool all right so thanks for
watching guys thanks to everyone who
sent over this hardware hopefully we're
gonna have like a gaming stream or
something later today
let's do oh yeah we can do that and then
thanks to see sonic for sponsoring this
video so they've got their find 180 plus
platinum there it is prime titanium it's
down there somewhere it's modular it's
freaking awesome it's super efficient go
check it out the link in the video
description and that's it goodbye
everybody
thanks man Dennis you'll finish those
and everyone else
all right there's what skip one so we
can skip Blanche away from the tradition
don't worry we'll be live again in like
a couple minutes here don't worry it's
all good yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
