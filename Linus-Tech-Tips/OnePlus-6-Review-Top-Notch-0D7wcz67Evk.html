samsung galaxy s 9 plus but you can
almost buy three next tier phones for
the price of two flagships and with how
slowly Android handset makers provide
operating system updates including
gigantic companies like Samsung this
cost of staying current metric becomes
an important one to consider so is the
s9 plus really $300 better than the one
plus 6 let's figure that out shall we

I already covered the specs of the
oneplus six and my recent sponsored
hands-on video so rather than listing a
bunch of part numbers I'm gonna just
make this PC analogy when it comes to
performance oneplus compromise is
nothing generation after generation
they've crammed the latest enthusiasts
grade CPU Ram graphics card and storage
device into an enclosure then saved a
few bucks by going for a mainstream
level motherboard a good if not
exceptional display and then some less
flashy peripherals so my demo unit here
is an 8 gig Ram 128 gig storage affair
and I could easily use all the same
words as any top-tier phone to describe
the experience of using it snappy flew
it lightning fast but every phone is
fast when it's new and you're all tired
of hearing that stuff so I'm not going
to do that instead I'm going to talk
about software because that's where
oneplus seems to be trying to set
themselves apart it wasn't a perfect
roll out but the oneplus 3 and the 3 T
were among the first older Android
phones to get Android 8.0 Oreo in
November of 2017 that's four months
before the galaxy s 8 and six months
before the s7 another 2016 phone this
kind of investment in software is what
keeps older phones secure and running
smoothly and it's something that I want
to encourage them to keep up especially
because I really like their oxygen OS
variant of Android it manages to not
screw up the light stock Android
experience while adding features and
customization toggles that improve ease
of use rather than adding frustration
and the display knotch
believe it or not is a great example of
this it's there on the phone but you
have to actually go out of your way to
make it do anything stupid
like take a bite out of a full screen
video in landscape mode you have to not
only enable the notch in the first place
but you also have to specifically allow
that
like YouTube to use that space and
oneplus also says that they'll be adding
an option post launch to switch the top
pixels of their AMOLED display off
completely so you will never have to
look at it at all
another big software feature this time
is gesture based navigation now I wasn't
a huge fan of apples removal of the home
button on the iPhone 10 and I still
prefer buttons be they physical or
software that I can click or push on but
I'm also all about user choice
especially when it comes to things that
there's just no good reason to lock down
like the ability to switch the back and
recents buttons Google so you swipe up
the middle for home then you swipe and
hold for recents and when you're inside
an app you just swipe up on the left
side or the right side for back it works
really well and in spite of my worry is
that back would interfere with scrolling
on long webpages the detection for where
the swipe needs to start in order to
register the gesture is good enough that
after 10 minutes I never accidentally
triggered it again
my only real complaint is that I would
like to see a configurable delay on the
recent gesture and while we're at it
maybe edge to edge coverage for the
included screen protector the ridge here
is a little too sharp for comfort but I
can't say the same for the camera we're
long past mega pixel counts meaning
anything so I spent some time in our
studio and on the streets of London to
gather some test images now no
photography buff like Brandon so I'm
sure my composition is amateur hour but
there's a lot of information that we can
glean here compared to the galaxy s 9
almost anything else pales when it comes
to low-light performance and Samsung was
the only one to handle this extremely
challenging high contrast shot correctly
so you see how the inner part of the
petals have some orange to them not one
of the other phones I tested including
the oneplus 6 managed to pick this up
though - oneplus is credit they avoid
the awful over sharpening artifacts that
destroyed pretty much everything
ten Pro spat out this brick right here
looks like a painting if you zoom in
enough and subjectively the six does as
good a job as any other device that I
tested of capturing the scene in front
of me as my I saw it with true ish to
life colors and not a ton of noise in
the image now I'm not into folk
post-processing background blurring
techniques but it does have that if
you're into it and thanks to the nice
wide F 1.7 aperture and larger main
sensor I found myself getting a touch
more real background blur in my shots
compared to other smartphones though in
fairness to the s9 in this one it is
sharper across the board we've reached
the point with oneplus where the camera
launch is so fast snap so quickly and
look so good that as someone who finds
stuff like a fraction of a second 960
fps slow-motion mode pretty impractical
I don't feel like I'm giving anything up
here even the selfie camera seems
adequately suitable with a background
blur update coming shortly after launch
which brings us to the part where we are
giving something up there is a reason
that Samsung moves more than twice as
many phones as their closest Android
competitor and many times more than
scrappy upstart oneplus with a little
bit of tweaking you can get pretty
screen off notifications like ambient
mode and you can get quick access to the
time but that is not as good as an
always-on display the one plus six is
water resistance is unofficial rather
than IP rated the six lacks wireless
charging altogether an awesome feature
these days oneplus is face unlock is
shockingly fast and works in a wide
variety of conditions check this out
boom but it isn't as secure as iris
scanning you give up gimmicky extra
camera modes like the s nines cool
panorama selfie the
six is earphone speaker isn't amplified
for stereo sound in landscape mode which
is a huge bummer for me
and while dual SIM is good a secondary
convo slot for a second sim or a microSD
card is much better the one plus six has
no expandable storage so yeah that is a
pretty significant list but none of
these things have a devastating effect
on day to day use for me like the
removal of the headphone jack on recent
generation iPhones and the pixel to
excel so oneplus gets mad kudos both for
keeping the headphone jack and for
making a great value high performance
device once again
now I'm gonna switch back to the s9 plus
but that's only because I already have
one if it was my money today the oneplus
six with a D brand skin of course
because even the matte version is pretty
darn slippery looks like a better bang
for the buck there we go that's a little
better now I can actually like hold on
to this thing deep brand skins are
available in a wide variety of different
colors and finishes and feature
unrivaled precision they measure many
times to insure a factory fit for your
product and not only do they look great
but they protect against incidental
damage and they make it easier to hold
on to your phone in the first place
their customer service robots are easy
to work with and wonderful on their
products are affordable and shipped
worldwide
check out D brand at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
