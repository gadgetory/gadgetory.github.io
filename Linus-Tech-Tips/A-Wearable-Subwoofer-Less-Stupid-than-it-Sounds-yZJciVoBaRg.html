time when you thought wearable tech was
about to be the next big thing in
consumer electronics then 2017 happened
and now you're just jaded AF because
instead of having a computer in your
contact lens all you've got is an
endless sea of inaccurate fitness
trackers and smart watches that make
Homer Simpson look like a frickin genius
so when I heard about the baselet a
subwoofer wristband that promised to
make you feel like you're surrounded by
sound I pulled in enough internet for
today and went to bed but then I found
out it was $200 and I thought this could
be perfect fodder for useless tech over
a hundred Silvan are their claims
completely baseless or is this little
device about to shake up the way you
listen to music
the Ripjaws km 570 mechanical keyboard
from g.skill features full RGB a simple
design Cherry MX switches and more check
it out now at the link below the
german-engineered baselet requires
hardly any setup plug the sender into
your laptop or phone's headphone jack or
dongle as it were then plug your
headphones into the sender all the audio
leaving your device passes through the
sender which routes the bass frequencies
automatically to the IP 44 rated
bracelet over low-energy Bluetooth know
pairing shenanigans whatsoever
the design is an understated matte black
with a plastic finish that's
subjectively okay and a single LED
indicator light with two buttons for
adjusting the intensity of your
experience but good design is more than
skin deep and low felt the makers of the
bass lit cared enough to make the sender
double as the units charger and so to
attach to the bracelet you just
magnetically snap it on and the buttons
are actually conductive contacts it's an
elegant idea even if it only takes a
slight bump to disrupt the connection
the only part of the bass le'ts design
that stands out as flawed is the
silicone wrist band it's pretty hard to
put on
especially tightly like the instructions
recommend you should pretty much factor
the replacement cost into your purchase
okay then so you've got your beautifully
designed $200 vibrators strapped on to
you ready for the bass lits psycho
acoustic phenomenon to trick your brain
into thinking your whole body is being
accosted by sound waves so with your
favorite tunes cranked what does it
actually feel like well did just about
exactly what you'd expect your wrist and
by extension part of your hand and arm
will vibrate along with the music but
wait hold on don't don't click away yet
it's not like taping a vibrating cell
phone to your arm it's silent to the
people around you and there's
variability in the feel of the bass
notes being pushed out like you can
actually kind of distinguish a plucked
string from a kick drum for example and
per the recommendation of the reviewers
guide we gave it some more time it's
apparently supposed to take a session or
two for your brain to adapt and merge
the sound from your ears and the
vibrations on your arm into a single
experience and I have to admit my
skepticism aside it does in fact happen
if you wear it for a little while
particularly with the intensity kind of
somewhere in the mid level the bass
starts to feel less localized and it
becomes harder to distinguish whether
what you're feeling is coming from the
music or from the little trinket on your
wrist which is pretty cool but that
doesn't mean that the awareness that
you're wearing a little subwoofer on
your arm ever completely melts away and
to expect that might be a little
unrealistic then again there are some
cases where having bass localized
actually made a lot of sense to us
namely gaming so cranking the bass let's
intensity up to max and throwing on a
first-person shooter like doom can
actually leave you pretty shook but we
did find it worked best when it's on the
wrist that's connected to your mouse
hand or thinking completely outside the
box you can strap the chest thumping
beats directly to your thorax to really
get your heart rate up a please bear in
mind though that the baselet is not
recommended for people with pacemakers
and also that duct tape sticks to chest
hair really really well
finally while we did find one guy online
who likes to use his base lid on his
tummy we got our best results with the
device above the waistband although now
that I think about it it does come with
this extra shorter strap anyway the base
lit can also add some value in non
headphone situations like supplementing
your base model car audio or keeping you
immersed in your tunes as you put around
the house and it's not surprisingly
decent range
so then I was ready to tear this thing
apart but as far as jewelry goes it's
neither the most expensive nor the most
useless thing we have ever encountered
and my initial skepticism and annoyance
at needing to carry yet another fricken
dongle aside it does make your music
experience feel a little bigger but with
that said unless you're already rocking
a top-of-the-line audio solution at $200
we just can't help but wonder if your
money wouldn't be better spent on
improved headphones
