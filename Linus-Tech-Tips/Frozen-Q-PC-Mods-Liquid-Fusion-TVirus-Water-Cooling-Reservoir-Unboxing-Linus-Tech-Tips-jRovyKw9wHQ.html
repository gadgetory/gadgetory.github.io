lately guys I've actually had the swine
flu which is not a lot of fun so I
haven't been at work I missed our grand
opening but I got a package in the mail
today so here I am unboxing something
that I bought myself here that it came
in a box that's actually from one of our
competitors here so I you know I'm just
covering up the logos here as a lot of
you know I work at NCIX so I'm not
exactly going to go advertising for
competitors but anyway so the guy packed
it off really really well for me here
it's got packing peanuts inside so what
I bought was a three frozen QT ver t
virus inverse reservoir so first of all
here's the reservoir itself let's see
what we have inside for accessories I
have an inverter okay which has two bare
leads on it and as well as a molex
adapter okay so these appear to be
custom-made very cool alright so all the
wires go in one end rather than having
like a pass-through off to figure out
how that works later okay inside here we
have oh this seems to be the mounting
clips as well as a couple of screws so
these are clear acrylic mounting holders
so these are like a half moon shape is
one of them broken I hope not maybe I
better open these up really quick here
what did I do with my night
here I sure hope everything survived the
shipment because this took a long time
to come let me tell you $150 reservoir
and it must have taken a couple months
to reach me just because of the highly
custom nature of the work this guy does
I don't know these look great okay so
there's my acrylic reservoir holders
there those look awesome let's see what
else you got inside here I have a PCI
bracket oh that's a switch for the light
inside the reservoir so the way this
actually works and I'll explain more
later is there's um aji an acrylic helix
inside so you can see I have a liquid
fusion type with a tube with a 250 ml
tube I mean 150 is a little small and
for hundreds really big so I also have
blue color and there we go that is the
full specs of the t-virus wrasse that I
purchased today you can get in touch
with this guy over at extreme systems
you can actually buy these in a store
right now I mean it's the kind of thing
where I looked at it and went okay well
we could stock this but how would you
account for all the customization that
people want to do and that is gorgeous
so here is how the rez itself works you
have a bits power fill port that he's
populated for me at the top here and you
actually fill the rez via that now it
uses an aluminum housing for the top and
the bottom but the water doesn't
actually make contact with that at all
now you can get optional silver or black
caps I went with the black caps on the
top and the bottom I think it looks
pretty good and then you can get
different finishes on the actual helix
structure itself depending on what you
prefer you can get clear or you can get
kind of a frosted look so that when the
blacklight inside you can see the
blacklight on the inside there glows it
will actually light up your UV fluid as
well as the UV acrylic tube that is
inside now at the bottom of the red
hold on let me just get this back on the
threading seems good actually that's
excellent it's done a good job of that
on the bottom of the res you will find
the lead for my cathode that is inside
seems to be all sealed up there that's
good a couple of screws as well as two G
1/4 ports so I can use that to attach
looks like up to about 3/8 compression
fittings no problem and one can be the
input or intake and one is the outtake
for a water inside the reservoir so
here's a couple shots of it lit up
actually from one of his posts on Xtreme
system so you can get a better idea but
I think in a couple days once I've had a
chance to work on the system this is
going in I should be able to take some
time and show it with some fluid inside
it thank you for checking out my video
blog on the t-virus reservoir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
