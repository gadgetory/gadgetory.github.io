video you probably got a pretty good
idea of what's in this box but hot on my
knife clearly at this point I'm filming
the video I haven't read the title so
you're going to have to humor me as we
come along on a voyage of discovery here
okay so we know it's from Intel
Corporation could this be the plans for
world domination that we ordered I mean
what could be what could be red-hot rush
that sounds dirty oh alright then so
let's pop the side panel on this out
puppy there we go
and get a better look at what's going to
be pretty much the most generic damn
computer I think I've ever seen in my
life but wait maybe this is exactly the
point they're trying to make maybe this
3d crosspoint accelerator octane module
so amazing that it can make even this
mid-2000 style beauty fly well let's see
if it can
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel there the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description
alright we got it we got beaches 50
motherboard the most generic rare
another WD black 4 i5 7500 FK whatever
let's let's get all over that let's get
straight to the octane memory series up
Kade module whatever let's let's skip
over to this thing so this is a
fundamentally new type of computer
memory it's different from both NAND
flash and DRAM offering up a lot of the
benefits of both so lightning-fast
latency and lower cost than system
memory and lower costs and system memory
ok here let's just pull this out with
the ability to retain the data without
being constantly powered on like this
stuff you can actually learn more about
3d crosspoint in a couple of videos that
we've done in the past which you can
check out in the cards up there ok so
the way this is supposed to work on the
holding necessary the way this is
supposed to work is kind of like intel's
srt technology of yesteryear where you
would take a small SSD and you would
like bolt it to a larger hard drive in
order to accelerate your operating
system and frequently use programs the
difference though is that in the last
seven years we've gone from 32 gigs of
nand flash being a reasonable cost to
achieve this functionality to 32 gigs of
octane which intel is boasting at the
cell level is up to a thousand times
better in terms of access latency which
should translate to dramatically
improved system responsiveness
ok so for starters let's get them up
let's get the module back in there get
this baby fired up
get this baby fired up and validate
Intel's claims the way the product is
intended to be used so an octane module
with a mechanical spinning hard drive
probably should have been knocking on
that so in terms of benchmarks we used
pass marks disk mark a doe at a variety
of q-tips route times and Grand Theft
Auto 5 since it's notoriously long
loading times are the bane of the
existence of gamers who really play a
lot of Grand Theft Auto 5 everywhere but
come on you guys this line is tech tips
you don't want to see me test the octane
module the way it's supposed to be used
the way intel expects us to test it we
need a here alright get one of these out
of here ah yes we need an SSD I mean by
my logic if an SSD could accelerate a
hard drive because it's a lot faster
with much lower latency then an octane
module should be able to accelerate an
SSD I asked them about this at the super
embargoed event and they refused to
answer me opting instead to stick to the
marketing message well I'm not going to
accept that I've got the hardware in my
hands there's nothing that would prevent
me from testing this so let's shut this
baby down the manly way that's right and
fire it back up with one of these and
have a look at some numbers here before
we can evaluate whether octane can
accelerate the SSD we need to get a
baseline reading for the SSD in all
those same performance benchmarks so
it's a Kingston SSDs 401 terabyte and
you can see here we've got all of our
numbers run now and Intel octane memory
is disabled now this is really important
we enable it by clicking enable then yes
and then it
takes a couple of seconds here in order
to prepare the system copied some files
whatever the case may be okay there we
go so now what we need to do is run all
of our benchmarks a second time to see
on our clean octane run if there's any
improvement and the numbers are pretty
much the same but we were expecting that
octane like any caching solution works
by watching data access patterns over
time and then using the knowledge that
it gains to predict what data the user
is going to need in the future so then
what we needed to do was run an entirely
new round of testing to get a second run
of data to see what our mods will learn
the first time around and this time now
we are looking at a significant
difference and by significant I do mean
in the scientific sense not in the sense
that in real world applications the
average user would actually notice it
since the octane acceleration of an SSD
was only really noticeable in synthetic
benchmarks okay so it's conclusion time
then that was a lot of fun but I think
we uncovered the reason why Intel
doesn't want people talking about
accelerating an SSD
with an octane module if you want
greater than SSD performance there will
actually be full on obtain SSDs for
enthusiasts coming in the future but for
now I'd recommend at the price that they
come in at so 40 bucks or 77 depending
on the capacity you choose I'd recommend
sticking with the way Intel's marketing
them as a way to accelerate a mechanical
hard drive for a system that otherwise
wouldn't be able to achieve that level
of responsiveness it works
SRT but thanks to the improved
responsiveness we did notice a tangible
difference day to day just launching
applications and navigating the
operating system from having the opt-in
module installed on our drive is it
worth the 77 bucks for the
top-of-the-line one it's hard to say
like so many things in life I guess it
kind of depends on your priorities and
that's where Intel has lost me a little
bit on this one because they are
limiting compatibility with octane
memory to two hundred series chipsets
with KB Lake processors and up so most
of the people that Intel's trying to
sell an accelerator module for a hard
drive to have a brand new system and I
would question why exactly it is that
they don't then have a boot SSD for that
aforementioned system but I'd love to
hear that I'm wrong let me know you guys
based on what you know now that octane
is flipping cool and that it really does
work do you see this as a valid way to
use your system or would you just kind
of go you know what I'll use one of
these until I can get a much bigger one
of these you know what's awesome
home-cooked meals you know what sucks
eventually the worst part is like
thinking about what to make and shopping
for the ingredients if only there was a
solution to all right blue apron blue
apron delivers all the farm-fresh
ingredients you need right to your
doorstep in exactly the right
proportions so there's no trip to the
grocery store and no waste from unused
ingredients they're delivered in a
refrigerated box so everything is fresh
even when you're not at home when your
package arrives and their whole vision
is to develop a more sustainable food
system through sustainable fishing
responsible farming and reducing food
waste they've got two types of plans the
two-person plan and the family plan and
there is no commitment you can skip or
cancel the service at any time and the
first 100 people will get free free
meals on their first blue apron order

scription so thanks for watching guys if
you enjoyed this video then you can
click that like button I mean there is
also the other one but gather and if you
really enjoyed it you can get subscribed
you can check out where to buy the stuff

description and you can check out both
our merch store which has cool shirts

always watching out of the corner of my
eye for the camera person to cringe then
I know I've delivered it just right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
