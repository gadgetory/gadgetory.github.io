active noise-cancelling headphones for
your premium dollar bows or Sennheiser
let's find out shall we
intel skull Canyon Nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the
link in the video description ok so
there's a lot to cover here we're going
to jump right into this both headphones
fold in to an included carrying case
but Bose wins quite decisively here the
QC 35 s case is both smaller and more
durable feeling than Sennheiser's
offering onto the contents being
headphones and ones designed to fit on
the heads of humans the QC 35 and px II
550 are pretty darn similar in many
respects headband ear cups laser-guided
artillery launcher etc so I'll try and
dial in mostly then on the differences
here boses Alcantara covered headband
features noticeably better padding
devoid of internal bumps that can dig
into your head eventually but they're
sizing adjustment mechanism fits
perfectly on my medium motorcycle helmet
sized head at its smallest size and
feels more plasticky compared to
Sennheiser's both of them offer about
three and a half centimeters of total
adjustment though so if your head is on
the smaller side I expect you'll get a
better fit out of the pxc 550 the ear
cups themselves aside from both being
closed back designs with faux leather
covered memory foam for optimal noise
isolation are about as different as they
could be Bose has gone with a more
traditional oval shape for the cups and
angled drivers inside to direct sound
into your ear canals while Sennheiser
has done a couple of more unusual things
here so the transducer has this grille
over the top of it that looks kind of
like an apple slicer perhaps there's a
noise isolation or other acoustic reason
for this and they've gone with a more
ear like shape that fits well but in my
opinion along with the boring black
color choice makes the PXE 550 look
considerably less stylish though some
will find sex appeal in the user
interface
I suppose both headphones thankfully
have the ability to operate with a wire
if you're out of battery or even with
active noise cancellation enabled with a
wire if you just don't want to use the
wireless to make it last longer but
inexplicably they both rely on a two and
a half mil two three and a half
millimeter cable so order an extra or
two now in case you lose the included
one since you probably don't have a ton
of those lying around with that said
Wireless is sort of the point here isn't
it so let's move on to that both of them
will pair with an Android phone using
NFC but while Bose has stuck with a
traditional button based interface power
on pairing mode here with volume
adjustments and a multi-function button
that handles media playback and phone
calls over here sennheiser is using a
fancy touchpad on the right ear cup that
allows play and pause track skipping and
volume adjustments with gestures fancy
though it does still have some hardware
buttons one to toggle the Bluetooth
radio for battery savings during wired
operation with noise canceling enabled
one for toggling movie and speech
optimized EQ profiles and a
three-position slider that lets you pick
0 active noise cancellation fully
enabled active noise cancellation with
the four included microphones or an
adaptive mode that adjusts the level of
noise cancellation depending on ambient
noise levels conspicuously absent though
is a power switch with Sennheiser opting
to build it into the hinge a design
choice that I personally do not prefer
let's get back to noise cancellation
though the QC 35 specs are less
impressive looking than the PX e5 50s
and I really like Sennheiser's easy
access to mix and match combinations of
Bluetooth noise cancellation and wired
or wireless interfaces but boses ANC is
noticeably better in the real world this
is particularly true of unpredictable
sound like nearby
conversation both of our competitors
will cover consistent background noise
like the low rumble of an engine almost
completely at even a quite moderate
listening volume like two to three bars
on an iPhone and both of them managed to
avoid that traditional problem with a
and C products of a painful pressure
sensation on the eardrums so thumbs up
there the with that said a pair of
construction ear protectors with a white
noise generator inside would probably do
the trick if all you wanted was to
ignore the crying kid in the seat behind
you how do they sad well there's no
doubt in my mind on this one if you're
an audiophile the pxc 550 is the better
choice BOCES sound signature as much
less veiled running off of a cable with
the active noise cancellation disabled
but while both products are operating as
intended wirelessly with a and C and it
should be noted with Bose you cannot
turn the anc off if it's powered and
running wirelessly the QC 35 s have a
very one-dimensional sound to their bass
reproduction and such strongly veiled
mids that I found it hard to enjoy my
favorite vocalists to be clear the pxc
550 s aren't exactly on par with
Sennheiser's open backed audiophile
products but they're well balanced with
tight punchy bass fun vocals and the
good ol sennheiser veil on the high-end
that made them less fatiguing to listen
to for long periods at least that would
be entirely true if the PXE 550's were
as comfortable as the QC 35 s I have got
to give Bose though this is a narrow
victory to be very clear here the nod
when it comes to long-term comfort both
of them are lightweight and stay in
place very well but putting on Bose is
offering it feels like your head is
getting a hug from a friend while
Sennheiser needs another few millimeters
of padding on the headband to draw even
here which isn't to say then that the
back and forth trading of winds here is
over bluetooth time
Sennheiser only manages to identify your
devices by numbers like phone one
connected while Bose manages to inform
me that it's connected to Linus's iPhone
when I turn it on with that said I can
probably accept remembering which of my
devices is phone one connected for the
sake of superior range while I was
working on writing this I had to run
downstairs to hit the bathroom and I
left my phone on my desk and it wasn't
until I'd been in there for but law
actually okay never mind how long I was
in there but the point is the PXE 550 s
never missed a beat while my attempt to
repeat my test with the QC 35 resulted
in stuttering the moment I closed the
door on to battery life then I'm going
to call this one a win for Bose though
it is a very narrow victory
partly because Bose advertises about 20
hours of battery life and delivered 24
and Sennheiser puts 30 hours on their
website though that's based on a more
ideal operating scenario and running
more apples to apples against Bose it
actually ended up being very similar but
both of them can handle a full day of
music playback without recharging the
battery which is damn impressive so who
is the winner then this is not an easy
question to answer today Sennheiser is
charging more and offering up more
consistent Bluetooth connectivity and
superior sound quality while bose boasts
boasts better noise cancellation a
better carrying case and a more
comfortable design at a lower price
there so I know this is a bit of a
cop-out but frankly the conclusion is
this you'd have a very hard time going
wrong with either of these so go ahead
and flip a coin I am sure that you will
be happy with your new wireless
headphones and you know what else you'd
have a hard time going wrong with
