CES this year Coursera expected the 250d
to be the star of the show but like many
other members of the press when I walked
into the room my eyes went straight to
the graphite 760 T a stunning case that
fuses smart design with a big departure
from Coursera traditional aesthetic the
box that comes in is huge which would've
been a problem for me of course there
hadn't sent me two of them's and I have
a like a pile of 760 T's for some reason
and the box contains excellent soft foam
packing material to keep your case safe
all the way to your door now normal
people once they get it out might look
at their brand new case and think wow
that looks really sexy but my first
thought was actually Wow
structural integrity must have been a
real challenge here normally the kid the
screws and tightness of the fit of the
metal side panels will add some extra
strength and rigidity to the case but by
its nature a huge piece of plexi like
this is going to have some serious flex
to it even with the engineering that
obviously went into building each side
panel couple that with the chassis
itself having less metal to accommodate
that large window and by extension more
flex than normal and it's a recipe for
disaster right wrong given that they're
only attached with little hinges at the
back and magnets at the front the panels
do more than I would have thought
possible for the strength and rigidity
of the chassis and with them in place it
might well you got to close it I guess
with them in place it actually feels
very solid alright so the next natural
step on our tour of the outside is the
side panels both panels on the 760 T
have acrylic window panels on them even
though the right side is opaque so you
don't actually see the rat's nest of
cables most system builders leave back
there they snap into place with magnets
and a latch and they're opened with a
comfortable solid feeling handle they
swing all the way open to be out of your
way if you need to get into the system
and if you need to do some serious
maintenance on the system you can just
pop them off their posts and remove them
completely
I love the design here functional and
beautiful top marks Corsair front i/o is
nothing groundbreaking power reset power
and drive indicator LEDs are all
accompanied by two USB to ports and two
USB 3 ports and then there's a fan
controller toggle that leads to four
internal three pin fan headers I'm not
really that fond of toggle switches
since it's hard to tell at a glance what
setting it's on and hard to adjust
correctly without looking at it compared
to a more tactile switch type but I
think it is a great inclusion one other
improvement that Corsair could also make
is to hook up the fan leads out of the
factory NZXT does this and it's a really
nice touch when your case arrives and
all your fans and cooling is basically
ready to rock if you plug in one power
connector so with all that said though
I'm really glad to see it there just
watch out if you're buying the
lower-cost 730 T it is not included on
that one a stealth optical at the front
is something that I haven't really seen
that much these days most manufacturers
just keep putting five and a quarter
inch bays in the front and a case but
acting like they don't really expect you
to use them good on course therefore
making the front of my case look good
with or without an optical drive if we
could see the envelope pushed even
further so that that five and a quarter
inch bay cover is completely stealth and
maybe there's just like a
pressure-sensitive bottom corner you
press on or something and it flips down
that would be fantastic but either way
I'm still glad to see that because some
people do still use optical drives the
front fan filter feels solid and is easy
to remove unfortunately one of the clips
did break on mine but I would chalk this
up to bad luck and it's an easy fix if
it happens to you just contact customer
service and they'll ship you a new front
piece every time I've dealt with course
there's our ma department the experience
has been really solid the bottom fan
filter for the power supply is
functional see slides out of the back
but much less impressive to me now that
I've seen the magnetic filter
implementation on the 450d way to make
your own product look bad Corsair
because that one is awesome basically
magic and speaking of magic or magnets
the magnetic plastic cover on the top
is very tastefully done the angled shape
at the front makes it look more like a
futuristic design choice rather than
just a you know practical way of
choosing between a cleaner plane top
versus a more cooling friendly
ventilated top also of note is that the
color matches really really well and
knowing Coursera this is not an accident
they spend a lot of time on color
matching behind the scenes so they
should continue to match not only out of
the box but for years to come
owners of early NZXT phantoms will know
what a problem plastic fading out faster
than the paint on metal can be at the
back we find nine PCI slots which seemed
like an odd choice at first but George
came to the rescue and explained it
allows 3-way SLI with triple slot cards
I was like okay and also said maybe
we'll see some more excel ATX
motherboard designs in the next
generation of products so I got to
George the 140 millimeter fan an ample
cable management room at the back means
that the chassis is quite wide but I see
why they had to put so much cable
management room into it normally with
the metal side panel that really locks
into place and you can kind of like pile
up the cables behind it and then just
like force it down um that'll work but
with this one that panel would bowl like
crazy if you tried to put too many wires
piled up behind it so they just had to
give you a lot of room to make sure that
you didn't end up stuck trying to do
that inside we see that in addition to
the excel ATX compatibility the case
will work with EA TX boards but
full-width enthusiasts dat exports
basically don't exist anymore so I can
see why they didn't bother to do two
full sets of cable management grommets
like on the 800 d even though it is
compatible since I'm talking about these
things grommets here they are well
positioned and use a high quality
material but given that Corsair
popularized what is now basically the
industry standard in cable routing holes
we haven't seen much further innovation
since the 800 D I mean what about making
things even cleaner with like like angle
shaped ones that fit into these little
spaces along the top or something like
that
do
courser that would be absolutely awesome
and I mentioned this before but there is
tons of cable management room in the
back and a metric but ton of wire loops
on the back this is really important
because it helps you keep things nice
and tidy back there I would say the only
place for cable management really needs
a bit of improvement is around the two
and a half inch drive base these mounts
back here are spring-loaded and super
handy but even though the SATA power
implementation on this power supply is
fairly standard it was hard to route the
power connectors from one cage to
another and also while I appreciate that
course I wanted to leave the area pretty
open so I could show off my sexy new
Tron GTX SSDs they didn't give me a good
way to hide the cables that are going
into the SSDs or for the front fans
although those ones are quite small um
it's just a bit of an oversight on a
chassis with an enormous window for a
side panel but it's again it's a very
very minor complaint another thing that
I will leave up to you guys whether I'm
being diva tastic or not is the front
panel connectors internally are covered
with a nice heavy black sleeving but the
wires inside are not black and that's
visible when you plug it into the board
usually Corsairs attention to detail is
what sets them so far apart from the
others but this is something that
they've done in the past that is missing
here black wires alright moving on to
the rest of the drive cages I'm not a
huge fan of course there's three and a
half inch drive cages there tooless and
easy use but I wish they were a little
bit more robust on top of being modular
the 760 t includes two of them that you
can put side-by-side in the bottom you
can hang from the five and a quarter
inch base or you can stack up from the
front and you can add another two for a
total of twelve three and a half inch or
two and a half inch drives to go in
there along with the spring-loaded ones
the 760 T is super roomy inside and
water-cooling support is a very strong
point I would be surprised if it takes
longer than a few weeks for an end-user
to cut up the five and a quarter inch
base to allow a triple 140 millimeter
radiator in the top because the mounting
holes are there but on paper it supports
a 360 or 280 in the top a 240 or 280 in
the front a 120 or 140 in the back out
and a 120 in the bottom
noise it makes me sad though that the
top man / radiator mounts don't get any
airflow with this top magnetic piece in
place a small gap around the outside
edges would allow at least some air
through but I guess it would also ruin
the extremely clean look of the chassis
when it's covered so I don't know what
the right solution is here guys let me
know in the comments if you'd prefer a
gap when it's closed so those fans can
breathe a little bit or if you'd prefer
to just have the choice okay I want
completely clean or completely open and
I'm okay with that
one thing last thing I noticed that
pretty much sums up my feelings on the
700 T is this corner brace right here it
represents the compromises that were
made from a rigidity perspective to
deliver an aggressive and yet not
over-the-top and like you know ricey
looking aesthetic it's part of the
reinforcement solution that they needed
to make this case work at all with the
panels off there's still too much flex
in this case for me to be okay with
course are calling it an obsidian class
product but I'm totally okay with it as
a graphite product and overall the
quality foam packing and the wonderful
aesthetic that couldn't be achieved
without compromising on its ability to
be used as a chair for a hippo is a
trade-off that I'm willing to make I
should mention that the 730 T is also
available but in my opinion it's worth
the extra for the 760 T you get the fan
controller you get the windowed side
panels which to me are what really make
this case work and like that's pretty
much it guys thank you for watching my
video review of the Corsair 760 T don't
forget to like this video and share it
if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment and let me
know your thoughts on the aesthetic of
this case I hope we have some really
good footage in here so you guys can get
a really great idea of what it looks
like in person
I mean sometimes that's the challenge as
things don't look as good in video as
they do in person and this one really
does look fantastic in person also we've
got a support link in the video
description so you can use that to you
know buy t-shirt for exam
we'll give us a kickback when you buy
stuff on Amazon by changing your
bookmark or even give us a monthly
contribution to help us keep making
these videos for you and I think that
pretty much wraps it up guys thank you
for watching and as always don't forget
