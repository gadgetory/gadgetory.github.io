the rabbit-hole method of gaming on
linux showing off some of the well more
involved methods to get your game on
penguin style and in a massive surprise
to no one we got a bunch of angry
comments from Linux people but they're
um actually outrage wasn't entirely
misplaced I can actually definitely see
how the average viewer might watch that
video and think wow gaining on Linux is
really hard when actually many games run
on Linux right out of the box so that is
what today's video is all about simple
gaming on Linux and it's brought to you
by madrenas madrenas coffee blend
specialty cold brew coffee Zin
convenience 16-ounce grabbing yo cans
for everyone's convenience check them
out and use offer code linus to save 40%
today it someone have to comment on one
of our previous videos that these are
clearly fifteen fluid ounces and that
the discount is actually 50% but minor
details right
so we pretty much took it for granted
that because many of them are on Steam
native Linux games don't really need a
how to you you point-and-click and Bob's
your uncle but that was before valve
unveiled some very cool new tech under
the hood that has the potential to
change the gaming industry forever I'm
not even exaggerating it's called the
proton API and as it turns out you know
that arcane stuff that we were showing
off in part one well valve has been
actively supporting developers of
software like wine and D xvk in order to
improve gaming on Linux and proton
actually includes a number of gaming
related fixes and performance
improvements over vanilla wine plus full
controller support so what we want to do
today is see if it lives up to the hype
step one is obviously to install Linux
on your computer now we're not really
gonna go into a ton of detail here
beyond to say that we have gone with
Ubuntu now you might not like Ubuntu but
quite frankly I don't care if you don't
like Ubuntu then go ahead and use
whatever you want
as long as it can run the Steam client
which actually isn't even necessary
since you could just compile proton for
yourself and run it on whatever distro
is your personal jam
step number two is to make sure that
your graphics drivers are up-to-date
now for some distributions you may need
to download the driver from invidious
website like on Windows but on a bunt -
all we need to do is load up a terminal
then type in sudo or su do mu bun -
drivers Auto install enter our password
and wait for the tuxedoed magic to
happen can I get like a magic sound
effect from the editor now using the
Nvidia X server settings program we can
see that we've got driver 390 dot 48
which is perfect and then a quick note
here is if secure boot is enabled on
your computer you
we'll need to follow the prompts to make
sure that everything works afterwards if
you don't care about that then you can
just disable it in the BIOS step 3 then
is to install steam for a bun - that's
as easy as clicking download just like
you would on Windows then running the
dot de Bie package that you get once
we're done we can go ahead and launch
team log in and get a list of all the
games we have available to play step 4
is to just play your games so in the
case of Deus Ex mankind divided and
other steam play titles we actually
don't need to do anything with proton we
can just fire it up and run it just like
on Windows Albee it with usually a
significant performance hit like I don't
want to oversell the Linux experience I
just want to make it clear that Linux is
not to blame for a lot of these
shortcomings it's typically down to poor
driver optimization from the video card
manufacturers this TVs legs not bad like
especially with the G 603 so we're
completely wireless that's not bad at
all actually your dad how is he not dead
I mean bullets you have to put in these
people it's like they're made out of the
same bullet resistant flesh that I am
hip markers are so fun
oops oops oops oops oops yeah so the
gaming experience then is just like on
Windows ok then so far so good but now
we're gonna go a little deeper step 5 is
to install an on Linux game so why don't
we go with doom which actually needs an
update here before we can even start it
it's running really well I mean it's a
1080p ISO like and like it's very
responsive I haven't seen I saw maybe
one thing that I could describe as a
hiccup other than that it's butter
smooth that really is incredible this is
a Windows game and I'm just running it
like Bob's your uncle hey Bob fan how
about a fist of Base Space Marine style
now the current list of so-called white
listed titles is pretty short but you
can expect anything on it to basically
just work like that and that's not even
as far as we can go with the new proton
API which I guess brings us to step 6
experimentation so if we go to the
settings menu in steam we can actually
see that we've got this Steam play
section here where we can enable Steam
play for all titles pretty cool this
opens up the entire library for us to
install though it's worth saying that
here be dragons
while many games may work out of the box
on your particular hardware only games
on the whitelist are guaranteed to work
you can actually tell valve which is
cool which games you want them to work
on or if you have issues or if they work
fine by using their newish platform
specific wishlist function for now let's
experiment and see what we can get
running shall we
won't we start with a pc building
simulator this just trips me the crap
out just seeing a Windows game run on
Linux oh ok this one doesn't run very
well ok well it's I said good I didn't
say has already give them time edie
let's try something else and I didn't
try it in OpenGL yet actually I'm gonna
try and open jail this is Linus tech
tips not Linux tech tips ok we're
separate the spinning fan looks like
it's running a little smoother but no
guarantees it ok that's a lot better
ok let's shut this one down and try
something totally different and now for
something completely different
some of the kids will get the reference
the old kids logout I thought for
squidding stuff is supposed to be easy
in linux turn it all do it in there no I
can't even get the terminal up ctrl alt
functions - oh and she's locked up she's
done she's done it's not a reset button
there it is we did say here be dragons
okay grand theft auto 5 is taking a
little while here should this one launch
no oh ok so you knew this so you knew
this was gonna happen you're just
messing with me
ok so much for that why don't we try
that game duck game I've never heard of
it this one doesn't work either
you're just messing with me oh you're
trying to show different ways of it
failing so it could have a launcher come
up and then fail it could just do
absolutely nothing or we could move on
to Skyrim failed to extract plug-in file
okay speaking of here be dragons Skyrim
might be working that actually even
seems like it's running at an OK
framerate dang Skyrim works buddy my
fist on this rock dad your dad I'm
probably screwing up whoever same game
this is whatever I'm probably a loser
anyway that's a cow fight it with this
axe well let's see if it takes out this
guy whatever this guy sucks let's take
his clothes alright that's probably
enough for that not everything works
that well crisis is a drm fail so it's
actually the the DRM crap that won't run
not necessarily the game itself and then
pub G is a similar story in this case
it's the easy anti cheat that fails to
install wait witcher 3 isn't that a
steam game this one is running pretty
pretty though it should be noted that
this particular game supports hair works
in Windows but not in
and that was true of the xvk - but does
hair works really enhance the experience
that much I mean I guess it depends who
you ask and what they're a fanboy of so
there you have it I guess the real
takeaway here is that we want to give
the less Linux savvy folks out there a
little bit more of a push to give this a
try because it really is simpler now for
the power users out there by the way
you're probably gonna ask proton doesn't
yet support running games outside of
steam like wine does but for the
enormous library of games on Steam you
are completely p.m. covered so then is
the year of the Linux desktop upon us in
my opinion not yet but it does feel a
little different this time
Linux driver support for example
actually seems to be becoming a priority
for AMD and NVIDIA for once so to use
like a train analogy the Train might not
be here yet but I also wouldn't throw on
my noise-canceling headphones and take a
walk along the track that it's
approaching on 3rd will take is
celebrating their 20th anniversary with
their level 20 case series they've got
four styles to choose from the VT the XT
the GT and then an updated version of
their triple chambered full tower case
all of them feature a sleek modern
design with rounded front corners and
tempered glass and all of them have
ample room for cable management and
radiators yes water cooling they also
all feature USB type-c connections on
the io so check out the link below to
get yours now on amazon.com or whatever
other Amazon you prefer so thanks for
