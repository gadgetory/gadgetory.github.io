the NZXT helmet and this is the second
most random thing I've ever received in
the mail this is the NZXT blade okay so
I'm going to assume that by blade they
mean sword and by sword they mean this
thing is probably going to be at least
as cool as that helmet which you can
actually wear so check out my unboxing
of the helmet where you can see I
actually do put on the helmet it fits
and everything has like a little
adjustable plastic piece inside okay so
when we first open up the blade you can
see that there's like a piece of foam oh
okay the foam comes out okay so we got
the foam and then there's okay here is
the sword look at what comes with it in
terms of accessories so they give you a
wall mount for the blade like wall mount
so it's got their logo on the bottom
here it's kind of like a nice wood
looking veneer okay there's a couple of
screw holes so I'm guessing those are
either for mounting probably for
mounting the sword and then there's got
to be some way yeah there we go so
there's where you can attach a hook to
mount it onto your wall okay so then I'm
guessing all that mounting hardware it's
gonna be here somewhere you know what
let's just kind of turn this over and
there's all the mounting hardware that
we need to mount the sword itself okay
so let's get this sword out alright
so it's got a nice uh blunted piece on
the end here so that you don't hurt
yourself okay this is just an NZXT
promotional item so it's not something
they actually sell but there's their
logo they got some like cool-looking
artwork on there it's a plastic handle I
mean it's not gonna be a real functional
sword or anything like that but it's
definitely a cool-looking showpiece you
know if this was on a wall or say for
example I had it in my office because
that's probably little
I'm doing with it so what I'll do for
the benefit of our viewers is I'll you
know give them a demonstration of what
it is to be truly nerdy all right so I
got my helmet going on here I got my
NZXT sword so thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the NZXT sword and and
while the helmet - don't forget to check
out the helmet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
