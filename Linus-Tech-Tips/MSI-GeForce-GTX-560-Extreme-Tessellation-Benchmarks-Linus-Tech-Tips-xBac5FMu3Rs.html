bit of a different take on the gtx 560ti
so I know I included a lot of games with
tessellation as part of the overall
visual package that they include
including hawks to as well as Metro 2033
when i did my full 560ti as well as
tessellation information video review on
my NCIX comm channel which you should
check out but i wanted to take a
slightly different approach and i wanted
to test a couple of the card so i have
the 560 TI here i have the 460 hot which
i'm going to run at stock for 60 speeds
just so that we have a more clear
understanding of where the ti falls in
place with the original 460 or the 560
TI with the 460 i included the 570 GTX
from nvidia as well just to give us a
little bit of perspective for how a
higher-end nvidia card will perform with
heavy tessellate or a rather extreme
tessellation enabled in heaven i also
amusing 4x anti-aliasing and 8x
anisotropic filtering and then i also
threw in some competition from the red
camp so i have the radeon 6950 and then
i also have a radeon 6870 so these are
both positioned well close to a little
under and then within spitting distance
of the pricing of the gtx 560ti so let's
see how these cards compare in an
extreme tessellation benchmark
so for my heavy tessellation test i
actually discovered that while the gtx
560ti performs above where you'd expect
in between the gtx 460 and the gtx 570
that is to say that it's a little bit
closer to the 570 than it is to the 460
it actually outperforms both of the ati
radeon bob rather excuse me and the
radeon cards in my testing so it
outperforms the 6870 as well as the 6950
in the heavily tessellated version of
the heaven benchmark so thanks for
checking out my video and i don't forget
you can also see my real game
tessellation benchmarks in my NCIX com
video on my other channel don't forget
to subscribe not only the lawn
detectives but also NCIX calm to see all
of the unboxings reviews and other
computer videos that i do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
