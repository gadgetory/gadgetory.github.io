brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys we're here
checking out Bitcoin and butterfly labs
and they had something that caught my
eye immediately I'd actually seen a mini
press release about this before I came
to the booth and just wasn't sure where
they were because there's a little bit
of a mix-up it was really excited when I
saw it so what can you tell me generally
about this product so we have our new
monarch product it's our six hundred
Giga hash high-capacity ASIC mining card
and it's actually a dual dual system
where you can use it as a PCI Express
card or you can use it outside of your
computer as a USB device and if we were
going to offer a number of different
options for it from air cooling water
cooling and in both an open loop and a
closed loop version that open loop
version looks absolutely insane you guys
did a really good job with that and I
like that you guys have all the
different variations that someone could
possibly want now how can you go about
connecting this I know there's the USB
version like what what requirements do
you need for that you just minimal
requirements you can use an Android
laptop you can use mac you can use a
Windows and it's it's just standard USB
and you can use just about any mining
program I know Mac miner sports it bit
mint or CG minor B F G minor and of
course our own AZ miner and then for
connectivity sake a USB header can take
crazy amount of these so you just need
PCI Express power to put two sets of six
pins and then USB header of some sort to
go to the card right yeah and for every
single root hub in your show every USB
chip in your computer you can have up to
100 2627 devices connected to it so
that's an absolutely insane amount of
devices I know I've seen quite a few you
guys on the forum purchasing up a bunch
of really cheap power supplies and
running a few cards off it this is a
pretty good idea for that because it's
not going to take a crazy amount of
power to power each one you just have a
couple power supplies powering your
extra cards which is not a bad idea yeah
each unit actually consumes roughly 350
watts yeah the main I've seen is this
like it's a pretty off-brand about 20-25
dollar 450 watt power supply that people
are buying tons of and running a bunch
of cards so that would be perfect now
what can you tell me about this hardware
wallet
so our newest product is called the bit
safe and it is a hardware wallet and it
will basically store your private keys
securely and never expose them to the
host computer so you could take this
hardware wallet out to a public machine
internet cafe it may even be compromised
and have malware on it and we're working
with some of the wallet manufacturers
such as blockchain armory that sort of
thing
we will you'll basically be able to send
a request to sign a transaction and it
will go to the bit safe the bit safe
will sign it internally and send it back
out so the private keys will never be
exposed and you'll never have to worry
about your bitcoins being stolen the
future is here that's freaking cool you
can have a hardware wallet that's
awesome because I've been I've been
wondering about how that goes and it's
interesting because every once in a
while you hear that someone will lose
their wallet yes it's just like thank
God well you also bit when you first in
Stan she ate your wallet you'll be able
to print out a paper backup and store it
in your safe so even if you lose your
hardware wallet you just get a new one
and you reload it onto that wallet it's
a really good idea we've heard some a
few horror stories about that so one of
the features that we're including with
it is actually a solar cell on the back
so you can leave it sitting on your desk
or what have you and it will charge the
battery you can in the screen is a
version of e-ink that is very low power
so it will even operate the screen
directly if you are very low on
batteries you can't charge it via USB
but as long as you let it sit in the
light it'll charge itself I find a lot
of these devices that you're able to
just sit in pretty much any light they
never really die anyways because as long
as you don't keep it in your pocket 24/7
they'll usually have some amount of
charge and you said it's really
low-power - right right yes the the
eating screen just used is just very
minimal amount of power and
it's we're trying to make his low-power
so it'll last as long as possible
without ever having to recharge now can
you explain the different options you
have when going through a transaction
with this thing like what what can it do
in terms of transactions so in addition
to being able to plug it into a host
computer the main feature and probably
the main way people will use it is via
the camera that it will have and you'll
be able to scan QR codes with it it will
also be able we're still debating on
whether or not we're going to have a
Bluetooth module where you can send that
in real-time but the camera will allow
you to use QR codes such as a like a
llama sue ATM or someone's smartphone or
even another bit safe which the bit safe
will be able to display a QR code for
receiving and another bit safe will be
able to send to that one so if you had
if you and a customer or a buddy or
something had two bits a so you could
theoretically just take pictures of each
other's QR codes and transfer bitcoins
that way yes absolutely so if you're out
for dinner one night yeah you owe me the
only quarter Bitcoin you can send it
right there from bit safe to bit safe
that's awesome how much would each one
of these individual units cost and the
hardware wallet each card will run it
right now runs $2,100 for the 600 Giga
hash for the 300 gigs around $1,200 the
hardware wallet we want to make it as
cheap as possible and we keep trying to
get the price down get the price down it
looks like right now it'll be probably
in $150 range I would love to get a some
sort of device maybe not the bit safe
itself but something in the 30 or $40
range something we're looking at I don't
know if we can do it with the at least
with all the features we want but it's
something we definitely want to do I've
got a few people that I know that have
more expensive wallets than that so well
it is a little bit up there and I'd like
to see around 30 for you as well I could
see a few people buying it thanks for
watching our our butterfly labs video if
you want to see all of our CES 2014
