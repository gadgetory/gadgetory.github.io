boxee box okay so it's in the shape of a
box it is another media streamer but
this one is actually pretty unique so
let's go over the overall outside of the
box of the voxi box and then we'll open
it up and talk a little bit more about
some of the cool features so okay let's
start with the front online movie shows
and videos for your TV okay pretty
straightforward
next we have the inside contents which
will actually show you so there's no
real blending for that here we go
so the voxi box gives you on demand TV
hundreds of TV shows available for free
from your favorite networks ready to
watch anytime huge movie library from
the web and watch new releases and
stunning HD from premium movie services
now netflix is rumored to be available
for the Boxee box and within the year or
sometime next year I think it's within
the year next you can play your stuff
too so you can access videos songs or
pictures from your computer or home
network so if you have a home server or
just a home computer you can just throw
up a file share play all of your files
on your TV you can see what your friends
are watching through Facebook and
Twitter and share your favorites and
give your wallet a break with tons of
free entertainment from the internet
with no monthly fee so that's all pretty
cool right let's go ahead and open this
up and find out what is inside the
package for the box TV
first things first we have the unit
itself which is kind of unique looking
we will take this out but then we're
going to show all the accessories before
we really get too far into it there we
are so it sticks out of your table kind
of like that looks like a cube embedded
in the table inside of the packaging is
all black cardboard here and I'm just
sort of taking this out so there's
that's what was housing the boxy box
itself and then next we have a power
adapter right you'll need that next we
have an HDMI cable pretty standard HDMI
cable looks to be six feet long okay
so that's to hook it up to your TV next
we have a GPL code statement include
software code developed by third parties
including software code subject to the
general public license okay remember the
Boxee does use open source software and
there are going to be many third-party
apps in fact there are already many open
source apps available for the voxi which
will allow you to access content that is
not necessarily officially supported so
you didn't hear it from me but you heard
it somewhere so step one is there's your
easy setup guide okay it comes in a
couple of different languages and
finally a little bit more documentation
and then the remote no it's actually
pretty nice oh that's really nice okay
let's have a look at the remote for a
second here look at that so we've got a
full keyboard on the remote including
access to lots of different special
characters and whatnot we've got arrow
keys space this looks like a Menu key of
some sort and then on the other side
very very nice we've got a play button
as well as a menu button and then I
can't tell whether this is gonna be just
a button or a touchpad Wow I'm actually
like flying blind here I'm gonna have to
do some some definite follow up videos
on this guy to show you guys all of the
cool features and to show it to you in
action but just give me a moment and I
will be back so now let's have a look at
the unit itself as you can see it's
quite small now this is actually Intel
Atom based so there's quite a bit of
processing power going on inside the
Boxee now you can kind of see the boxy
logo there and then it says by d-link
right under it I'm sure once it's turned
on and like I said I will be doing some
more content about this particular media
player coming up shortly here's our
power switch here on the top well it's
hard to tell what's the sort of the top
and what's the sides and because it sits
on the table like that so it's kind of
challenging but on this side we're gonna
find our SD / MMC slot and
and this is clearly the back because
that is where all of our connectivity is
so there's our power input as well as
our analog audio out we do have support
for optical audio out as well as audio
over the HDMI cable then we have two USB
ports as well as a LAN port so on the
bottom you have kind of a rubberized
grip II bottom so that it's not going to
move around once you have placed it on
next to your TV or whatever else you
want mean you can use a monitor if you
feel like it doesn't actually matter but
I want to talk a little bit more about
these software features so if you go
into the repository that's where you can
actually access the apps and you can
either install apps individually
depending on your preferences or there
are some app bundles that you can
download and I'll be giving more details
on this in my follow up videos and
that's what's going to give you access
to a lot of the really cool content on
the Boxee another thing that the Boxee
does really well is it sorts your media
you can get all of your album art
downloaded and the way it organizes it
is pretty unique so we'll be doing a
video on that as well mostly this is an
unboxing and a stay tuned message for
all the coverage that we're going to do
about this cool little media player
