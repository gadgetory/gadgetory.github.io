now to learn more external hard drives
are pretty difficult to get excited
about these days especially with SSDs
being so much faster and more rugged so
you can like check them around and all
that stuff but is there still a place
for the hard drive well depends who you
ask a data obviously plays in both the
external hard drive and USB storage
spaces and they've also got SSDs as well
so apparently they still think there's a
place for the hard drive and this one
right here is pretty unique so it has a
three-year warranty it uses super speed
USB 3 however that will be bottlenecked
by the hard drive itself inside and it
uses the new slim form factor hard
drives that are available on the market
so both WD and Seagate have been making
a ton of noise about these slimmer form
factor drives so one terabyte drives are
up to one terabyte drives available in a
7 mil form factor and then up to 500 gig
drives available in a 5 mil form factor
so this guy right here I don't know what
drives in there but it's only eight
point nine millimeters thick which means
it's definitely not a nine and a half
millimeter drive it uses a stainless
steel enclosure so you can actually see
it's got a beautiful brushed finish on
it in addition to the mirror finish that
has the a data a Qi 720 logo in the
middle of it then we can go ahead and
flip it over it actually has some weight
to it which I don't mind for a product
like this where it makes it feel more
quality as opposed to making it feel
heavy it's not the kind of thing that
you'll be carrying around you know like
a phone like hey you know all my arms
are getting tired from holding this up
and it's actually not that much heavier
than a smart phone anyway I love metal
finishes we're gonna go ahead and pop
out my HTC one so we can do a quick size
comparison just to give you guys some
idea how slim this is right again
depending who you ask the hard drive is
very much not dead and they are
determined to keep updating it for
modern devices so there you go there's
that size comparison at the back you
find the OneTouch backup button as well
as the USB 3 interface
and that is pretty much all there is to
say about it physically so I guess it
comes down to software so they include
OneTouch backup software they also
include their OS to go utility which is
I mean honestly it's nothing that
special all it does is it takes an
operating system that you have on a disk
and it converts it to this drive so you
can install over USB ok you can do it
manually but ok if you don't want to
figure out how to do that it's kind of
handy to have that but they also have
their HDD to go which allows you to take
around some of the settings from your
computer plug it in and then use it as
as kind of like a no trace left behind
way of using that computer so it'll
bring over your favorites it'll allow
you to sync the desktop as well as My
Documents folder and then once you
unplug all of that goes away with you so
I think that's pretty neat as well the
stainless steel finish has a nine
hardness scratch resistance so I don't
know I'm kind of tempted to like try it
out now so at least if we take something
like let's take like the end of a let's
take the end of a pen here see if we can
oh yeah we can scratch it it's not that
bad
accessory-wise it includes a simple USB
3 a 2 micro connector as well I'm not a
big fan of micro connectors but I
understand why on a super-slim product
like this it's been used as well as a
little plastic carrying case so you can
there you go keep it safe mind you to me
you'd have to make a pretty strong
argument for taking a nice slim sexy
product that's durable already and
putting a sort of bulky connector like
bulky case on it looks really good this
way thank you for checking out this
unboxing and first look at the 87 24 May
data don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos don't forget to
like the video if you enjoyed it don't
forget to comment on the video let me
know what do you think is there still a
place for hard drives given how much
less expensive they are compared to SSDs
or would you be wanting to switch to
exclusively SSD or flash based storage
moving forward it should be noted that
the finish on here is pretty fingerprint
attracting however it looks like there
you go
you guys had pretty bit of a look at
however they seemed to wipe off
relatively easily which is something
that I would often criticize about other
finishes is that they are difficult to
clean and this one doesn't seem to have
that problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
