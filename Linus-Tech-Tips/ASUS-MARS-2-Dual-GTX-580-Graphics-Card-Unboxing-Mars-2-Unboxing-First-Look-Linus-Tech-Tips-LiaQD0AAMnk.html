a very limited edition card that's right
even more limited edition than the GTX
590 which is very very hard to find
these days
features 2 GTX 580 GPUs but the GTX 590
has those GPUs under clocked in order to
meet the thermal and power targets of
that particular product as well as to
increase the yields on the one that I
have with me here today no such thing
has been done this is not a GTX 590
because unlike the GTX 590 this not only
has all of the CUDA cores enabled but it
is running at full GTX 580 clock speeds
which makes it more of a GeForce GTX 580
sli but it's still on a single card this
is the Mars 2 from a seuss this is a
Republic of gamers branded product and
it better be for the price point it has
physics 3d vision including 3d vision
surround because it has dual GPUs it
supports Nvidia CUDA as well as nvidia
sli yes in theory you could run 2 of
these monsters on a single motherboard
in Quad SLI with 4 GPUs let's open this
bad boy up and have a look at what a
soos has to say for themselves about it
so they're saying it is 22% faster than
the GTX 590 ok with three gigs of gddr5
memory that's 1.5 gigs per GPU it
supports their GPU tweak utility which
allows you to adjust the core memory
clocks core voltage and fan speeds it
features a direct see you tube cooler
which apparently uses 212 centimeter to
120 mil fans for 600 percent more
airflow than a generic GTX 590 it also
has 21 phase of power delivery Wow ok
which allows it to deliver 15 percent
performance boost for
with a 2.5 times longer lifespan and 35
degree cooler operation pretty neat
alright let's go ahead and flip this
over see if there's anything that they
have on the back that they do not have
on the front aha
minimum recommended system power is no
less than 1,000 watts now that's a
little absurd there's no way this car
pulls a thousand watts of power in fact
with two even with two of them in a
system you could probably power it with
a thousand watt power supply so I
wouldn't worry too much about that it
requires two eight pin power cables it
has a maximum resolution okay aha
there's the engine clock so 782
megahertz and then four gigahertz on the
memory with three gigs of RAM let's go
ahead and get this opened up and have a
look at the card you've all been waiting
to see since you press the button to
watch this video
oops
not so good it's just the box if I rip
the card then we'd be having a different
conversation
all right this thing is huge although
I've come to expect that from a suits
republic of gamers graphics cards sure
we're going to do the old iPhone size
comparison you know what why don't we
hold off until just a couple more
minutes until we have a chance to take
the card out so here's a little custom
engraved serial number thing maybe it's
a sticker no it's not a sticker this
document certified that certifies that
the limited edition Mars 2 is a unique
work of art design by the Asuza ROG team
right there so this is number 536 of 999
that is how many of these cards were
produced worldwide so there are not very
many of them in existence adapters
included we've got a couple of dual six
pin two eight pin power adapters
honestly though if you don't have a
proper power supply do not buy this
graphics card or buy this graphics card
and also buy a power supply right here
this exclusive a Sue's PCIe sustainer
for the Mars two ensures a perfect fit
and increased stability to protect the
integrity of your motherboard and PCI
Express 2.0 slot
okay Oh neat
okay so you take this and you put it on
the third one two three the third PCIe
or PCI slot and what it does is it keeps
the update you know what I'll explain it
once I have the card in my hand because
that'll be easier but that's cool
okay we have an sli bridge we have a DVI
to vga adapter although honestly if
you're running a VGA monitor in this
graphics card then let get with the
program okay let's go ahead and did I
say two PCIe eight pin connectors
because I missed three I guess okay
we've got some documentation here okay
we have a Republic of gamers sticker as
well as a driver in manual and a speed
set up to a QuickStart guide I guess is
what they mean by that
and finally the graphics part itself so
first things first let's do the iPhone
size comparison so there's the you know
what it's as thick as an iPhone is wide
so that is a triple slot card alright
we're going to go ahead and lay it down
gently whoa it's heavy okay so there's
the size compared to an iPhone this is a
very very long graphics card alright
it is also significantly taller than a
normal graphics card so I honestly I
don't even know where to start with this
thing yeah let's do the GTX 590 size
comparison so if we take the GTX 590 and
lay it on top of it remember GTX 590 is
a big card actually I'll be back in a
second I want to show you one other one
alright so there it is with the 590 but
I realize the 590 is so much smaller
that it just Dwarfs it so I'm going to
go ahead I'm going to take the largest
graphics card that I have this is a
Radeon 6990 and you can see that it is
even longer than a Radeon 6990 so before
you even consider putting one of these
cards in your system make sure you have
enough oh yeah you know what not just
length but make sure you have enough
height clearance like if you have a side
fan or something like that you might end
up having to move it unless you have a
very very large case so
oh my goodness it's actually really
heavy so why don't we start with the
front of the card so we've got our dual
120 millimeter fence now these are not
wussy 120 20 millimeter fans these are
case fans these are not like slim ones
look at the size of the hubs on them so
these are going to be blowing air
downward onto the heat pipes
okay the heat pipe fins here and then
further down onto the PCB so each GPU is
actually cooled by one two three four
heat pipes can you see those heat pipes
in there all right so those are drawing
heat away from the GPU itself up into
the fins and then you can see there's
actually two separate heat sinks that
are mounted directly onto the GPUs
themselves so here you can see the other
heat pipes right there and then the
other heat pipe fins and then in the
middle there's actually a total
separation between those two units so
the way they're assembling this card is
they're in all likelihood attaching
those talked to and then they're fitting
the shroud overtop of it so the shroud
fits here onto the backplate so the
backplate goes on okay that screws into
those heat sinks okay and then you're
screwing this shroud on and then finally
you're attaching the aluminum this is
just this looks like how many pieces of
aluminum is this okay it's a couple
different pieces but this is basically
one two three four five six pieces of
aluminum all fitted together and then
attached to that shroud just to make it
more of a sort of work of art really
then just a functional graphics card so
let's have a look at the back of it Wow
all right on the back you see we have a
back plate which says Republic of gamers
Mars - it is oriented correctly so that
once the card is installed in your case
you will be able to read it on the top
you've also got your serial number on
there as well you've got most of the
power delivery and some RAM and whatnots
is all located on the back of the card
but you can't really see them because of
the backplate it uses a standard PCI
Express 2.0 16 X slot and also uses a
standard SLI Connect
that's about the only thing about this
card that is standard moving along to
the top actually here I'm going to keep
it oriented this sorry guys this thing's
so heavy it's actually really hard to
hold okay we've got Republic of gamers
Mars - we've got a splitter here so both
of our fans are running off 4 pin pwm
power we've got our limited edition and
then for PCI Express 8 pin connectors
yes 4 we've also got like a turbo fan
speed button here so we can ramp those
fans up to 100% speed just with the
touch of a button if you don't want it
to be automatically managed and you want
to overclock as much as possible let's
move around to let's look at the back of
the card we haven't really done that yet
so at the back we've just got some
awesome holes in the shroud and that's
pretty much it there's not really much
to cool back there because I don't know
if you guys notice this but check this
out
the card actually ends here see that's
the end of the PCB so this extra bit
here doesn't really have much functional
purpose which is interesting ok let's
move around to the bottom so at the
bottom you can see we've got a lot of
room for airflow to come off the card so
it looks like what a soos is intending
is for these 120mm fans to be blowing
air out the top of the card as well as
the bottom of the card in the back of
the card and the other more different
back of the cards I guess that's the
front of the card so that's going to
give your motherboard some cooling okay
just some some incidental airflow coming
off the card you can actually see some
of the RAM chips down here as well and
finally let's move around to the back so
in terms of our display options we have
DVI DVI we have HDMI and we have
DisplayPort now as soos hasn't
specifically called out support for 3d
vision surround so you know what maybe
if someone knows if it supports it go
ahead and post in the comments but my
guess would be that it does support it
but you would probably have to use a DVI
DVI DisplayPort yeah I'm not sure
actually yeah someone post in the
comments let's see let's see what you
guys will you guys know oh here's an
interesting one if you are planning to
use to Mars 2 is for Quad SLI the
rampage
extreme or rampage three extreme black
edition is required this is recommended
for the best performance filed by a dual
16x PCIe and the best cooling operation
because remember with a triple flaw card
you're going to need a fair number of
slots in between your two 16x slots in
order to make both of the cards fit in
your system so other than that you know
what let's just do a couple more shots
of this so you able to take a little bit
more footage of it and actually I forgot
to tell you guys what these little
Stoppers were for so these little
stoppers go on the slots next to the
Mars two so that the weight of the Mars
two doesn't cause unnecessary strain on
the PCI Express slot that it is
installed in so I'll show you how that
would work so you would go ahead and you
would install the stoppers on by this
cart or on this slot right here and then
you install the Mars 2 into this slot
and see how that weight is going to pull
down well that stopper keeps it from
flexing so much so that's that's the
thinking behind those little those
little black strips so I think that's
pretty much it thank you for checking
