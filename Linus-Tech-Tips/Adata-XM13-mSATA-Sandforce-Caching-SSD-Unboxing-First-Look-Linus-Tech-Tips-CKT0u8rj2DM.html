gig em SATA SSD xm1 3 so this is as you
guys can see a bit smaller than a
typical SSD so here's a two and a half
inch SSD for reference the whole box is
like the size of a regular SSD so what
is this for if you don't have an M SATA
slot then it's not real relevant to you
but if you do have an M SATA slot then
it's very relevant to you
it stands to reason am i right there you
go that's the hole size there's a whole
SSD in there M SATA is basically a
standard of SATA that takes the standard
sized connectors and makes them even
smaller so it is actually here we're
gonna go get a SATA cable as well as a
SATA power adapter 10 for pin this is
pretty much the same darn thing a SATA
except that you can clearly see that
that won't fit and then you can clearly
see that this power cable is not going
to fit see how the spacing is much wider
in here can you see that
then here so so cool ok
so M SATA SSDs are great for a very very
small form-factor low-profile notebooks
or netbooks great for using as you know
a low density boot drive because this is
only 60 gig em SATA SSDs can only be so
big because you've got only room for 4
flash chips on the whole Drive itself so
there's two over here as well as the
controller so actually here I'm just
gonna peel that for a second it has a
sand force oh wow this is a sand force
controller Drive cool sf 21:41 and then
you've got four flash chips running off
of it now it is also useful on the
desktop for a certain particular
application most people don't want a 60
gig boot drive these days I think slick
needs to sneeze
we'll just take a break so it's also
useful on the desktop if your
motherboard has an M SATA slot just like
this gigabyte one right here does BAM
I just installed an SSD which is okay
it's neat it's cool it's cool but it's
mostly useful for Intel Smart Response
technology so if you're on a platform
that supports it that is z68 or whatever
platform this is that I don't know what
it is because I might release this video
before the embargo date as long as it
has a mini oops and then say the slot
then you can cache your boot hard drive
or even another hard drive maybe you
have a separate hard drive the storage
drive that you have steam installed with
all of your games on you can set up your
M SATA drive to cache that drive so
whatever games you play most frequently
will be cached in your SSD and the ones
you don't use as much can stay on the
bulk storage of your hard drive so that
is a very cool way to use it as well
things like shuttle bare-bones pcs
Austin include them I know there z68 one
does so you can throw this in on those
as well so this is going to become a
more popular feature moving forward but
if you want to be an early adopter then
a data and gigabyte not this board some
other board that you've never seen
before
might be the way to go don't forget to
