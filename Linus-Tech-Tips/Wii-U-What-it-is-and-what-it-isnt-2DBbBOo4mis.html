guys welcome to my wii u overview if
you're not interested in what's in the
box and you're not really that
interested in faq there'll be a
timestamp in the below in the
description just to jump you towards
more thoughts and conclusions about Wii
U if you are interested in the other
stuff stay tuned we'll jump into that
right away one extremely common
misconception is that this is the Wii U
this is a Wii U gamepad and it's one of
the big very unique things about the Wii
U but it is not the Wii U another thing
is that people think this is the Wii U
this is the Wii Wii U isn't just like a
big way or small way or anything it is
actually not a Wii it is a Wii U this is
a Wii U it is different it looks quite
similar but it is not the same and well
it's not the Wii a lot of accessories
and cables will actually work from a way
to reuse so that we use sensor bar is
the same as the Wii sensor bar so
they're interchangeable the component
cable from your we will work on your Wii
U although I do recommend using the HDMI
cable in the box
many Wii games as long as you have the
disc will work on your Wii U and we
controllers will work on the Wii U as
well you can technically play up to 6
players in different games but finding
games that support that is going to be a
little bit of a pain my favorite over 4
player game that I've played so far is
Super Mario Bros u or might have got
that name slightly wrong but whatever
and what it is is 4 people will be on
screen playing and then you can have a
fifth player in a sort of they call it
boost mode but it's like a god mode
which interacts with the environment in
different ways so you can put blocks
down if some way like if it's this four
players so it actually increases
difficulty because you bump into each
other so much so if someone jumps and
someone jumps on the head and it throws
them down you can kind of catch them
with a block and there's a few other
ways you could interact with the
environment as well which is actually a
pretty cool way of doing it so if you
say you have a bunch of kids and there's
a dad he can kind of play with the Wii U
gamepad and interact with them while
they're playing but he doesn't have to
actually jump in and take over one of
their spots which is absolutely kind of
cool I like that a lot
it also supports many games will also
support off TV play so say your mom is
watching her
favorite TV show you can still play your
Wii U wherever the heck you want because
you can just play it on the gamepad well
as long as you're within vicinity which
is again very cool there was some
foresight into that and there are some
good ideas in the Wii U there's also
some terrible ones another good idea is
that you can actually expand the storage
via USB so external flash drive our hard
drive will work fine you can transfer
things like downloaded games save data
and Mees and more from your old way you
to your new Wii U although this is a
one-way street it can't be transferred
back just don't forget that now for some
things that can't really do it will not
upscale Wii games they will be shown in
standard definition you cannot use your
gamepad for Wii games you have to use we
most which is probably fine because if
you have Wii games you probably had a
Wii you probably have wii modes but
still you cannot watch like Netflix or
do anything like that on your gamepad
while you're playing games because it's
not separated like that it has to be
used for one thing although if the TV is
being used for something else like I
said before you can still play games or
watch Netflix on it somewhere else in
the house many games are going to be
720p upscaled to 1080p although there
will definitely be some games at 1080p
it's not always at 1080p but we've seen
that with next-gen hardware from other
brands as well so this isn't too
surprising
now as PC enthusiasts you guys are not
buying this for it's crazy blazing fast
hardware that's not what's happening
here this thing's hardware is not
specifically impressive at all even a
little bit so why would you possibly be
interested in this and why am i
interested in this because I have a
fairly high powered computer myself I'm
interested in this because of what it
can do not what it is I'm not interested
in the hardware power of Wii U at all
I'm interested in it because it can play
Nintendo games it can play stuff like
Zelda Wind Waker HD Pikmin 3 wonderful
101 Super Mario 3d World and in the
future it'll be able to play stuff like
Mario Kart 8 Hyrule warriors if you
haven't heard of Hyrule warriors look it
up it looks really interesting Super
Smash Bros and like where the hell is
Mario Party 10 there's no news boat at
all but hopefully that in the future
what I'm not interested for Wii U is
stuff like watchdogs and Call of Duty
and Assassin's Creed and much heavier
stuff because I'm just going to go play
that on my computer
especially big multiplayer games the
WiiU online support is very weak so if
I'm going to play something online with
all my friends I see myself doing that
on a computer not a console the console
Wii U console I expect to play when kind
of more friends come over and don't feel
like hauling their PCs at that time so
it's it's an interesting position there
is stuff to be interested about and
there's a lot more exclusives than other
consoles like Xbox one or PlayStation 4
as much other stuff that's kind of
really confusing as well in terms of
what the heck is going on Nintendo is an
interesting company because they're very
locked within their own ecosystem but
like why aren't they more locked within
their own ecosystem in my mind other
people are like no open up Nintendo is
never going to open up they're never
going to release a game on mobile
they've said that more than once what I
don't understand is like why doesn't the
3ds or 2d s work with your Wii U like
why can't I use one of those as a game
pad that's what they essentially are
anyways they're just much smaller why
isn't that a thing
why can't I play pokemon X&amp;amp;Y on my wii u
why isn't there a mainline pokemon game
like pokemon X&amp;amp;Y on my wii u that
doesn't make a ton of sense what will
hopefully make sense is a price point at
some point in time we saw a surge in
popularity with 3ds and to Deus when the
price took a drop now the Wii U has
fairly recently had a price drop down to
three hundred dollars you can get a $300
one with Super Mario Bros u and Luigi u
that price is subjective to ten billion
things that's usually why we don't say
prices and videos but still but I see it
being a lot more attractive at say like
a 200 or 250 dollar range with those
games in it as well I hope these kind of
things happen because I do want intend
to exceed I'm sorry succeed I grew up on
Nintendo and I do still really enjoy
these games I wish there another
platforms but they never will be so
there's a lot to think about Nintendo
stock keeps kind of going like this
lately I know a few days ago it tanked
really hard but then I think last night
it skyrocketed again up like two bucks
or something which is actually a huge
movement the whole industry doesn't
really seem to be decided on the whole
intended thing so what is your thoughts
what do you think about Nintendo post on
the forum posting the comments below
either one also what do you think about
these kind of format videos I recently
did an oculus video that was somewhat
like this one and now there's this one
what do you guys think again
