my composite to four pole three and a
half millimeter adapter that I need to
plug my Super Nintendo into my fancy
OLED TV wish I had a framemeister but
this will do the bad news is five
minutes before we started filming this I
tripped on this cable knock mice nests
off the coffee table and cracked it here
and here and now it makes this noise the
good news is that whether you have
working hardware or not analog is
launching their super NT very very
shortly so it is a great time to be a
retro gaming enthusiast if you're into
this Ness and we have the perfect tool
to make your experience complete this is
exactly what it sounds like the SD to
SNES it takes this and adapts it to this
so tax mech one PC is an ultra slim
desktop built for gaming featuring a
sleek robotic style design check it out
now at the link below so on first glance
there's really not a lot to this guy but
as we dig beneath the surface a lot of
thought was given to the tech that's
gone into it and compatibility so it
should be a complete loam near-complete
one size fits all so on the subject of
size and fit you can see it is shaped
like a Super Famicom cartridge but it
has the tabs for the North American
region version so what that means is
that it will fit universally in any
smash or Super Famicom without any
modification whatsoever this SD card
slot has near universal compatibility so
they don't have support for exFAT yet
but it supports up to SDXC and they've
tested up to 200 gig cards in here so it
should be pretty much format fat32 and
go it can't take full advantage of the
speed of those high-end SD cards mind
you but roms loading at nine megabytes a
second is pretty good and they claim
that menu navigation is snappy on the
high resolution 512 by 224 menu oh yeah
baby it's got real time clock support it
supports ROM size it's up to a hundred
and twenty eight megabit though only 96
is implemented right now because nothing
bigger than that has ever been produced
and they claim it will operate totally
seamlessly regardless of region so 60
Hertz and 50 Hertz and it's got a super
CIC or as I like to call it super sick I
don't know if anyone actually calls it
that but it's got a reverse engineered
super CIC chip inside of it so you don't
have to worry about any anti-piracy you
can run it on a non modded console from
anywhere building out your SD card is
pretty straightforward you just need to
format it fat32 it supports up to
sixteen thousand files per directory and
you have to select compatible roms it is
enhancement chip compatible though it
should be noted that starfox
I know you were gonna ask that starfox
is not supported
not that enhancement chip it's fired up
does it work I don't see the light on oh
that sucks
oh hey lights on okay hold on
Wow that looks terrible thank you thank
you built-in scaler see if there's
anything we can do about that
all right well controller me so whether
you're using an 8 bit DOE wireless
controller or an original one you just
navigate the menu like this and then
what do i what should I go what should I
do
sure dad and I own Super Mario World I
don't know if I could legitimately say
the same about everything we are
scrolling through right now oh wow that
loaded really fast
okay drop light
you know what I'm gonna be a dick and
I'm gonna do level 2 first so that I can
get this which Palace that's right well
okay
Oh input leg oh there is yeah that's
fine that's fine if I'm just gonna show
off my skills that would be on this
level anyway no this is not good not
good
oh come on enough of your bull crap
Anthony Oh gotcha
ah and I'm standing right on oh you like
that timing oh no no hate that oh that's
fine plenty of time for a comeback here
yeah get back get back get back over
here get back over here oh oh oh okay so
that's pretty much the experience with
original roms but we're heading into the
MSU one enhanced folder where there are
actually a few games that we've gotten
here like Legend of Zelda a link to the
past see that that's a 15 Meg Rome
that means CD audio
cool huh you know we treat unskipable
cutscenesthat's and none of the benefits
of emulation because it's not emulation
you're just running the original ones
and zeros that were on the original
cartridges on the original hardware for
basically the original experience unless
you are using modified roms like this
Chrono Trigger one for example but has
this slick animated intro so that's
pretty much it at $200 it's not cheap
plus you provide your own SD card but if
you're an enthusiast let's say for
example you've got a really large
cartridge collection and you hey you
don't want to wear them out or B don't
want a hassle around with finding them
and plugging them in and unplugging them
this is the way to archive your entire
library in one place and get the actual
genuine original experience of the
original software on the original
hardware and don't let the early 2000s
inkjet printed label fool you this is
the real experience let us know actually
in the comments too if you guys would
like to see more of this kind of like
retro emulation type content we haven't
really touched on it much in the past
