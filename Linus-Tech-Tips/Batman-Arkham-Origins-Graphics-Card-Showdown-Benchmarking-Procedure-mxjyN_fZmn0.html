click now to learn more welcome to my
Batman Arkham origins benchmarking video
I know you're probably wondering why is
this so overdue and titanfall should be
this video instead of Batman Arkham
origins
don't worry titanfall is hopefully
coming later on this week and if not
it'll be very early next week so don't
worry about that we'll have a titanfall
benchmarking video coming for you first
and foremost the hardware that we're
running here is a 39 60 X clocked at 4.0
gigahertz along with 16 gigs of 1866
megahertz ram and then various GPUs all
of our DP use our overclocked they are
not running at stock and there's a some
variance here because we're running
reference cards so some coolers are
running hotter than other coolers I know
the some of the AMD coolers on the
higher end are running stock at almost
95 degrees Celsius so pay attention to
that and if you want to see all of our
settings check out the overclocking dock
in the description below the video
four tiers I have my high tier running
at the 400 plus dollar price range
running at 2560 by 1600 P with
everything pretty much maxed out running
8x MSAA and everything else as high as I
can put it not including physics because
that wouldn't run on the AMD side then
when we jump down I only have one more
tier now I only have one more tier
because the lowest tier was actually
able to run the game at the exact same
settings with perfectly fine frame rates
as the medium tier so I just merged them
together so this is about the 400 to
$150 range and that's running at the
same general settings as the high-end
range except at 1080p instead of 1600 P
one thing to note as well is that this
is an Nvidia sponsored title when I
whenever I do these gaming benchmarks I
have to call out who sponsors the game
because things might be skewed in one
way or another and you can see driver
revisions in the future but as arkham
origins has been around for a little
while we've probably already seen those
driver revisions another thing to note
is that I'm not using the in-game
benchmark I know there is an in-game
benchmarking tool for this and there was
one for thief although I didn't address
it just so you guys know we won't be
using in-game benchmarks we will be
creating our own this is because in the
past
and some things in the future mainly
with phones we've seen though lately is
that benchmarking tools can be easily
skewed in one way or another and we
would like to use actual inking
performance to show you guys how your
card will run while you're actually
playing the game as the benchmark
doesn't pertain to you actually playing
the King as you guys can see here I'm
just in the Batcave I'm going to use the
training console for this benchmark once
you get in select a Batman go into
ranked go all the way over to the right
to downloaded maps and then select 100
to 1
once combat starts it's up to you to
survive that it's you versus a hundred
people as the name goes but you might
not get to the very end or you will but
for in two minutes I seriously doubt you
will in this benchmark only lasts for
two minutes
so good luck some pointers that I can
put out there are that your your most
ridiculous enemies are gonna be the ones
with unblockable items so say like a
knife or a machete to counter those guys
I would recommend using your Batarang as
it can take him up from a distance and
you don't have to get close enough to
actually get hit by it to do that you
just have to look at them and spam one
the guys that throw boxes or wooden
chairs or whatever like that you can
actually catch those out of the air so
if you see one flying at you it will
have the counter symbol above it and if
you right-click you'll catch it at the
air throw it back at him and take him
out and that's just pretty awesome the
armored guys will just block your normal
punches and one of the main things that
you can do to make this easier on
yourself is getting rid of people so if
you want to basically drop their guard
if you press middle-click it swings your
cape around and will kind of drop that
guard for a second so you can actually
start punching them and remove them from
the fight big combos will help a lot as
you can string them together and it
helps you knock people out and also if
you can move fast enough you don't have
to waste your time countering and
actually take more people out other than
that good luck I'm sure you'll find
better ways to do this than I did as I
only played the game for a little while
and I'm definitely not particularly
skilled that Batman combat so good luck
try your best feather the benchmark is
it's just fun no matter what so even if
you're not benchmarking it's fun I just
remember go to the training console in
the Batcave and try out one versus 100
that's a good time alright guys thanks
for watching my batman arkham origins
video while you're here on youtube be
sure to subscribe to see
all of our future content and as always
like and dislike the video favorite
share comment below what you think about
the difference between in-game benchmark
and external pre-built benchmark because
that's an ongoing discussion topic that
never really seems to end if you guys
want to jump over to the forum you can
check out the discussion topic on this
which might be a more civil and advanced
version of the comment section down
below sorry YouTube guys but it usually
is and be sure to check out the
