the HP m one-to-one 7 + fw MFP okay the
MFP is actually part of that
ridiculously complicated part number
that stands for multifunction printer so
this is a pretty basic multifunction
printer except for one key fact not only
is it a networked multifunction printer
it supports ePrint which is cool because
you can use not only a computer whether
it's a PC or a Mac you can also use an
Android smartphone or an iOS device or
even just from anywhere you send an
email of the thing you want to print and
as long as you've configurated the
ePrint feature of this printer then
it'll just print it for you which is
pretty cool so let's have a look at okay
we don't need to see the contents
because we're gonna open it here's the
missing minimum system requirements
which are basically like don't have a
prep computer from the 80s start
printing right away with that from the
set up no see the installation required
using HP smart as Beaufort through
virtually anywhere in the office with
wireless connectivity HP so it's
wireless - okay it's the most complete
affordable wireless MFP features an
automatic document feeder with three to
five key page capacity send and receive
documents using the 33.6 kilobit per
second fax yeah alright so pretty much
it so it's like Wireless and like
installs as fast as five minutes and
we're gonna put that to the test because
we're gonna be using this printer for an
upcoming NCIX tech tips showcasing the
ePrint feature and basically finding out
if it's as like bee's knees as HP seems
to think that it is so included is a USB
cable Oh phone cable wire it's only two
wires so is it like a wire or a cable
it's a wires and contract return
checklist okay
else we got here
yet I'm sure there's more stuff in there
don't you get a waistline all right
morph documentation power cable ah trade
receptacle doodad and yeah my field
things that's an emi shielding for the
court okay disks including read iris pro
for HP oh I dropped my lens cap for the
camera the cat away alright so here's
the printer itself tapes which is good
because if they totally fell apart and
shipping them by the time to reach do it
would have totally fallen apart
okay taking off some tapes part of the
unboxing process unpacking taping and it
looks pretty much like a multi-function
printer if I do I do say so so there's a
thing hey is that slick and I've spent a
fair amount of time determining the ins
and outs of this multifunction printer
for the most part paper goes in and
comes out and ink goes in and comes out
so that is the conclusion became - at
the end of it so up here is the theater
tray style paper input for the scanning
copying faxing functionality
down here is the flatbed style so it
goes in here and comes out here and it
goes in here and that also comes out
here because for a flatbed there
actually is no feeder system for the
paper to come out when it's done okay
you can also lift this up completely and
access where the paper comes out for
printing or for copying
but not for scanning because with
scanning paper doesn't come out at all
and you can install this piece right
here which then extends and then extends
again in order to keep the paper from
falling off because you want it to come
out but not off okay we can also access
nothing and the ink cartridge so this is
a mono printer so there's only black and
no color put that down
all the functionality of the
functionality Ness is done through here
so there's your screen there's your
Wi-Fi button there's for dialing numbers
to people so you want to send things to
know ideally not black pages come on
grow up
okay I'll soil your navigation here can
fold that in one step two step step and
then down here you can load paper which
again has that you know transformer
light unraveling this bit so it's a
35-page loader something about no paper
clips or staples cuz they're bad and
really it comes down to apron so we're
not gonna be talking about that right
now because that's for our NCIX tech
tips episode let's put that back on the
back i oh we've got your power in i've
got your Kensington lock
we've got your modem plug as well as
phone line and other than like not quite
phone line but more different phone line
i'm guessing this is plugged for a
reason always probably a pass-through
for the phone
I mean who uses a phone anymore I mean I
haven't seen a phone with a cable coming
out of it in like months USB as well as
Ethernet so you don't have to use
wireless but you can thank you for
checking out my unboxing your first look
at the laser Pro and 12:17 and FW which
is not the same
