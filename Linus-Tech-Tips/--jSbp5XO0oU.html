powering our nab coverage this year
check them out at the links in the video
description so many of you know the
mainstream camera brands like Canon Sony
and Panasonic you may not have heard of
a little company called KITT affinity
there a Chinese camera brand
manufacturer that is up till now focused
on making high quality raw cameras on a
budget this year they unveiled a camera
they are calling the tera now what makes
the terror of such an interesting entry
into the camera market is that it's
available in both a 6k resolution model
and a 5k resolution model each of which
cost six thousand and five thousand
dollars respectively kin affinity has
effectively delivered the most budget
effective 6k camera currently on the
market but there's more to this camera
than simply high resolution the 6k
sensor is drawn from kin affinities
previous skinemax 6k camera but
delivering it in a small form-factor
that solo camera operators like myself
love both models of the HERA will
support standard 2.5 inch SSDs and while
kin affinity will sell their own you
have the option of using fast
third-party SSDs as well the 5k model of
the Tara will support both a rolling
shutter and a global shutter
simultaneously giving you an option to
choose between each mode depending on
your shooting situation while this does
affect your dynamic range on the camera
the rolling shutter mode will have 15
stops of dynamic range and the global
shutter will have 13 stops of dynamic
range both very respectable numbers for
any camera on the market the Tara does
support the typical raw recording they
have been known for however will also be
the first time any can infinity camera
is able to record up to ProRes HQ
internally which makes handling the
files and post-production a much more
streamlined process versus the raw
workflow kin infinity is also mentioned
to me that they're working hard to
enable their high frame rate modes to
also record directly into pro res
internally the high frame rate modes on
the Tara allow up to 225 fps on the 6k
model and up to 200 FPS on the 5k model
giving very solid slow-motion
capabilities to this camera
accessory-wise kenneth anita has the
option to add their own version of what
is essentially a speed booster similar
to the adapter I covered in this video
here the Tara is also fully compatible
with their current kidney back module
that
on dual XLR port SDI out timecode in and
out and DC power outputs I'm glad we
were seeing cameras like the Tara get
released into the current market since
we are now really coming into the time
where previously unthinkable features
are coming into cameras below the 10,000
dollar price point continuing the trend
of accessibility for nearly anyone
working at a professional level thanks
again this time Heiser for sending us to
nab this year make sure to check out all
of their new stuff for NAB in the links
in the video description also thanks to
Kingston for sending us here this year
check out their brand new superfast
micro SD card made for action cameras
like the GoPro also linked in the video
description so thank you guys for
