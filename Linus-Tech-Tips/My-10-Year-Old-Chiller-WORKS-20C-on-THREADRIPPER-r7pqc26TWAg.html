today oh this right here is a relic a PC
cooling solution that I haven't used
since the last time that AMD had a
relevant high-end desktop processor and
so what better way to celebrate
AMD's revival as a bonafide high-end
option thanks to the thread Ripper 1950
X then by resurrecting what I call the
chiller a sub-zero liquid cooling device
that might not look like much but like
the thousand-year bird-of-prey I don't
want to get in trouble with Disney hmmm
has got it where it counts
okay so step number the first and I have
already done this before but it never
hurts to do a sanity check when you're
gonna do something inside is to make
sure that what used to be a window
mounted air-conditioning unit is still
fully functional so here's your hot side
this is called the condenser so this is
where your phase change coolant comes to
have the fans blow through it and change
it from a gas to a liquid this is our
compressor which compresses that fluid
and then right over here this is our
evaporator so this is where the
compressed fluid goes to be exposed to
something hot in our case it'll be our
CPUs heat and evaporate then it gets
moved back around to the condenser full
load and i-264 about 73 degrees on the
cpu okay cool now we know about let's
see how much of a difference we can make
there's that hand mark beautiful while
that's running we're gonna need a few
supplies first up is a care package from
none other than the legendary they're
Bauer funny story
like two months before I decided to
resurrect that thing so since the last
time I went sub-zero for like a 24/7
system there have been some changes to
the conventional wisdom so it used to be
that we used dielectric grease in
anywhere where there were pins around
the socket and kneaded eraser was the
most popular thing for filling in the
bigger gaps around the socket not so
anymore nowadays apparently we're just
using Vaseline anywhere where there are
contacts and then we're using this stuff
paint it on to the board because it
comes off really easily liquid the tape
we're not as concerned about
condensation as guys that are doing like
crazy you know liquid nitrogen
overclocking or anything like that
because we are not going
that low and it should be noted that we
don't have to put this on too heavy
because we're not trying to thermally
insulating anything like that we're just
trying to keep moisture out of
everywhere that the brush touches oh you
know what I can probably just use the
big brush for this whoa here we go
technically removing things like
stickers would probably be a pretty good
idea so again I'm just really not that
concerned about it oh use hardware abuse
yeah I don't think ACS is gonna want
this board back
the other important thing here is that
we've gone with a metal top one so this
is a nickel topped version of the block
and the reason that's important is that
if we were running
oh shoot these these Barb's aren't gonna
fit I'm gonna have to go get different
ones whoops okay then so if we were
running a different version of the block
this plexi here could crack and over the
long term it would be degraded by the
kind of coolant we're using is that my
Vaseline I hear yeah dog okay I'm just
gonna jam that in there and Vaseline it
up I mean the Vaseline is supposed to
make it go in easier but so normally you
would really you know cut around
capacitors and you would do a super
amazing job of getting it all nice and
tight but the idea is that this is the
actual thermal insulation now the key to
any good insulation application is no
air gaps this is literally the worst
insulation of all time not every thermal
compound is suitable for sub-zero
cooling some of them actually perform
worse if you go too low so this one is
that was not what I meant to do stop it
oh this is goopy thermal compound we
also actually have to insulate our block
and the reason for that is that if think
about it metal is quite thermally
conductive right so if we have below
ambient coolant running through it
this block is actually going to sweat
and it's going to drip on to the other
components of our system if we let it
oh one thing we're going to need to do
before we do that though is get our
tubing attached so there are better
tubing's you know what I'm just not even
gonna say what I'm using because there
are definitely better tubing's for
subzero applications but one thing that
we are doing that's a little bit unusual
is I'm using 3/8 inch tubing over a half
inch barb and this is kind of a classic
aka old people water cooling technique I
would actually expect this to do a
reasonably good job like I'm gonna leave
this running while I go down and do an
show later and I do not expect there to
be any condensation on here so that
right there is the CPU area and then
next up you really want some of this
stuff so this is another arm of Flex
product and it's just an insulation to
thing that you can that you can throw on
to the tubing oh okay this is
legitimately kind of a problem maybe it
was that yesterday you do a couple
layers of this guy followed by another
thing that will be different from this
guy is he really putting that graphics
card in there again you knowing what he
knows from last time this is there's
nothing about this project that I
recommend trying at home okay literally
literally dangerous yeah like how was
there enough room for oh this has been
moved like oh look at this
that's been shifted why did I do this
why am i showing other people this like
where's this screw from there we go now
you might be wondering if this is
actually enough airflow and the answer
is yes so the whole cooling system
actually requires three plugs one for
the compressor one for the pump and one
for the cooling fins now what we're
going to do is fire it up for real
Kate why aren't those cooling fans
spinning play on hey there they go okay
dang it Jake
this is what happens when you put Jake
in charge of zip tying the stupid fans
before you start okay so now we need to
figure out our tubing runs we're gonna
go from the outlet of the block and
we're gonna give ourselves a little bit
of slack and then we're gonna come
through this cable management hole here
and then we're gonna go underneath the
evaporator and we're gonna let that kind
of pin it down so that the warm liquid
is as far away from here we go the
outlet of our reservoir as possible so
that it has to travel across the
evaporator before it can be sucked into
the pump so right now it's at 80 degrees
Fahrenheit whatever the hell that is
I don't know Fahrenheit anyone's
wondering no this is not to code and
also no it will not be staying running
for very long there's so many things
that can go wrong here
so many things to go wrong and what can
go right now cold CPU is this really
worth it that's dang it oh I think we're
ready I hope I have enough
I sincerely hope this is enough and here
we go again
and now we don't actually want to run a
sub-zero cooling system without the
system running because then it gets too
cold you get condensation for sure we
need some heat to offset it so let's see
if the system fires up here CPU
initialization is going this thing
better fire up why is CPU initialization
still going system's up cpu fan speed
error that's fine like I had said before
having some airflow around the socket is
definitely a good idea some air flow
around the RAM sticks is good as well
boss let's have a look at our initial
tent a we haven't even had the chiller
running for very long but I'm expecting
them to be pretty good what 52 degrees
how doesn't make sense
got water flow right 52 degrees I'm
finding that very confusing the only
thing I can think of is if it's grabbing
the temperature off of an external
sensor and then just using an offset
because the CPU is probably not that
cold like that coolant is still close to
room temperature okay so for our next
trick I'm dropping a thermal probe into
the liquid and finding out how cold it
is that we're running so far so but
we're at about nine point two degrees
Celsius and let's see what Ida has to
say about our temps here
ah ah that's more like it so yes that
CPU temperature was reporting with some
sort of offset near the socket which as
you guys might remember we insulated so
the CPU diode at somewhere between 10
and 20 degrees that actually makes sense
because you should be a little bit over
the temperature of the coolant while
you're at idle okay man show's over and
whoa it's working fantastic oh there we
go minus 20 degrees on the coolant minus
17 degrees on the CPU freakin fantastic
we're looking at CPU diode temps that
are under the ambient temperature of
this room by seven degrees seven degrees
less than the ambient in this room
freakin unreal
so it's frosted over anywhere where the
evaporator is expose
to the air which makes perfect sense you
guys can actually get a pretty good look
at what our uninsulated tubing would
look like check that out remember this
tubing is black you guys remember that
black tubing it's just completely snowy
and then this stuff insulates better
than that stuff for sure but you see the
pump would also have to be insulated
here check that out
cool right okay so by this point you
guys are probably wondering why why well
believe it or not this was at one point
in time anyway a fairly popular way to
get sub-zero temperatures relatively
speaking and the reason for that is that
compared to direct dye cooling with an
evaporator this doesn't have to be
custom done so you don't need any HVAC
certifications you just go buy a window
AC unit strip it down and do this
compared to that it's much cheaper and
obviously compared to regular water
cooling you are able to get much much
better result so even now that it's been
running for about five minutes we are
still sitting at less than thirty
degrees on the diode something that is
going to get us significantly better
temperatures which could lead to better
overclocking now as for the
disadvantages those I hope are fairly
obvious disadvantage number one is that
to do this properly is extremely time
consuming and yeah very few people end
up doing that everyone kind of does it
pretty Genki disadvantage number two is
it's extraordinarily difficult to
relocate your PC because this thing is
exactly as heavy as it looks
disadvantage number three it's loud like
check this out
putting my mic into the thing here super
loud and disadvantaged number four is it
can in some cases result in dead
hardware if you're not careful about
your insulation now for my part I'm
actually expecting like as quickly as I
did that I'm expecting my insulation job
to have held up just fine I'm gonna shut
this baby down and we'll take
look at it here though so yeah we're
doing just fine here this is barely even
cold to the touch out to the very edges
of our insulation here the problem is
just that it's easy to make a mistake
and anything worth sub-zero cooling is
probably expensive and high-end so
unless you can afford to lose that stuff
you might not want to take the risk and
the last drawbacks a lot of drawbacks
taken a long time is power consumption
and heat so in addition to your system
you have to run an air conditioner that
not only doesn't cool down your room it
actually spits massive amounts of heat
into your room so you can
air-conditioned your air conditioner so
you can air-conditioned while you
air-conditioned so thank you very much
