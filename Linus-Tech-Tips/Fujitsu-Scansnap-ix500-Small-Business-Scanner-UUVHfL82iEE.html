drop your jaw and move your bowels okay
so maybe I oversold it a little bit this
video is of the fujitsu scansnap ix500
and it actually exists not because I
think this is the most exciting product
in the world but rather because we
needed one for the office it's just a
handy thing we use and you lot told me
I'm supposed to make videos about that
kind of stuff so here we go with its
factory tuning and data center DNA and
Intel 730 series SSD is an amazing
choice for gamers and performance
enthusiasts we actually have a network
scanner already one that was a lot
cheaper but our business is growing in
our needs are changing so between
walking back and forth only being able
to scan directly to two PC's maximum its
lack of double-sided scanning and its
inability to handle odd sized paper
without resorting to the flatbed we
wanted something faster and more
flexible so in the box for the ix500 we
find the USB 3 cable Fujitsu software
Adobe Acrobat 11 standard a carrier
sheet more on that later and the scanner
itself resplendent in an improved black
finish that makes it not look straight
out of the 90s like the S 1500 that I
over viewed last time around on NCIX
tech tips software setup is also
improved from last time it's much faster
to install but one big issue that
remains is that if you don't want to use
the included CD you have to jump through
a bunch of Hoops to download the handy
management utilities I really wish
Fujitsu would come up with a different
way of doing this physically Fujitsu is
going for a so easy it only requires a
one-button
approach here so you unfold it from its
compact storage mode and you'll find
well just one button on the front
labeled scan on the back it's got a
Kensington lock a power jack a USB 3
port a Wi-Fi toggle switch and a WPS
button for easily adding it to your
network wirelessly to scan to multiple
pcs or smartphones running iOS or
Android but that's about it so the make
or break feature of this scanner is
going to be how well the software works
let's move on it took me a while to get
used to this one button concept and the
different ways that you can use it so
first up you can have the software
create a scansnap folder on your
computer that temporarily holds stuff so
you can email it out or archive it from
there and then that folder will just
automatically clean everything up after
a set number of days that's good for
certain types of work like
administrative work but the way that I
like to use it better is to have it look
for whatever device or window is active
then target that with the scan file so
if card mined there their business card
manager is up on my screen it'll it'll
go to their if organiser their scan
document organizer is up it goes to
their and if nothing's up this one's
great you press scan it scans to the
computer then prompts you with a whole
bunch of different options for what it
can do with it some of them are useful
like Dropbox and Google Docs scanning
while others are unfortunately less
useful with the email option being bound
to Outlook Express by default in Windows
7 and up and third-party add-ons to
change to Gmail all the one I tried
being a fixa being imperfect at best but
the good news is you can configure
whichever ones you want to appear and
leave the others speaking of
configuration options all the usual ones
are there so dpi settings go from normal
to better to best to excellent I mean
really you can pick color black and
white singular double sided you can
automatically remove blank pages prompt
for more pages when you're done scanning
or not and then we start to get into
some of the more exotic stuff it can use
ultrasonic scanning to detect an
accidental double-page in the auto
feeder it can auto rotate your finished
documents to keep everything easy to
read once it's scanned and there's even
an option to convert everything to
searchable PDFs with the included
acrobat software so then you can use the
organizer to search for any relevant
scanned documents very easily in theory
most of these features work really well
but in practice they're not perfect I
mean on a4 paper auto-rotate I'd say is
95 plus percent accurate but with things
like business cards and receipts that's
probably closer to 75 percent the text
detection for business cards and
searchable PDFs is also a little bit hit
or miss with documents I found that
searching for stuff off the top of my
head
usually yielded the thing that I was
looking for but the mode that lets you
highlight text and then apply those
keywords to documents didn't work that
well for me and business parts were all
over the place whenever they're oriented
wrong by the software text detection it
doesn't actually pick up any of the
pertinent information and organize it
correctly at all and even when they are
oriented correctly it missed a lot of
stuff I mean to be fair the speed and
image quality are good and business
cards don't follow very standard
formatting but I still don't think
that's an excuse for not tracking down
basic stuff like the phone number one
high point here though is that the card
minder application once you've entered
all of the missing data and cleaned
things up a little bit is really great
you can just press a quick hotkey and
bring up business cards extremely
quickly it's a lot better than having
stacks like this just lying around like
I have in the past so since we're on the
subject of good stuff the document
feeder is really great I didn't need the
included carrier sheet which flattens
out and protects fragile documents at
all it does a great job with slightly
ripped or even crinkled paper and on the
other end of the spectrum I accidentally
put in my star citizen card a plastic
card in it when I was scanning business
cards and if I hadn't been constantly
refilling the hopper to do more business
cards in one batch without stopping it
probably wouldn't have even gotten stuck
in the output tray and jammed but even
then the scan ended up looking fine I
was able to pull it out and I was able
to keep going just like that the one
thing I was able to defeat it with
fairly often was very very small
receipts like taxi receipts or weird
shaped business cards other than that I
was really impressed by the document
feeder and the impressiveness keeps
coming last time around the mobile app
experience with terrible I can even get
it working this time it pretty much
couldn't have been better remember that
bit about just scanning at whatever is
open when you press the button after a
short simple setup wizard you can get
Docs on your phone in two ways you can
load a document then press skin in the
app on your phone and boopity presto
it's on your phone or you can use the
quick menu to scan it to the PC like
normal then press mobile when the menu
pops up it will wait for you to launch
the app on your phone then push it to
you over Wi-Fi and
blough seconds without you even
interacting with the app on your phone
then if you want to go back to PC
scanning mode when you're done you just
close or even minimize the app on your
phone and everything is back to normal
within about a second very cool it
completely changes the way we scan
fingers around our office because
usually we just need something
temporarily to email an NDA to someone
or something like that and now anyone
with the password can scan something
directly to their phone by just walking
over to the scanner pressing scan on
their phone and Boop done five stars
right there but of course all of this
comes at a cost
the ix500 is super expensive especially
given that scanners have been commodity
items for like 10 years that makes it a
really tough sell for the average user
but with features like quick paper jam
removal user replaceable parts for a
longer lifetime and a pretty amazing
community building new mods and features
all the time for a business user even a
smallish one it's basically a no-brainer
I mean check out this little hack to use
the highlighting keyword feature to
automatically censor names on a legal
document how much manual crossing out
with that save pretty cool anyway guys
let me know if you care about us talking
about stuff in the future that we're
using on the business side of things or
if you'd prefer that we stick to
consumer grade stuff I really do
