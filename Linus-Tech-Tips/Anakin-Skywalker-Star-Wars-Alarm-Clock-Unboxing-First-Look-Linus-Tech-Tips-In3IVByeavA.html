ludicrous thing that I've ever found in
the NCIX warehouse this is the Anakin
Skywalker alarm clock from the Clone
Wars hit animated series so yes Anakin
keeps the time in his stomach and let's
go ahead and get this opened up because
I think this product is fairly
self-explanatory it's an alarm clock
it is Star Wars it has a number of
options including light or sleep as well
as I'm just going based on the pictures
that I see on the back of the box here
because I had I have no idea how this
alarm clock works I'm gonna have to
actually open it up before I have a
clearer picture of what exactly we're
dealing with here other than just the
fact that I've walked past it in the
warehouse and I was like oh it's Anakin
Skywalker and he's an alarm clock it's
amazing yeah okay yeah and apparently he
is held in with the force
oh no tape the force tape again it's
like horse armor but like adhesive
adhesive force armor okay here we go
so on the back we find some instructions
and whatnot so you can find English
hopefully yeah there we go
push down on the head force news and the
light and then to triple-a batteries are
included with this clock so we're gonna
go ahead and install those for sure the
back of the alarm clock has alarm on and
off set the minutes set the hours set
the time set the alarm ah okay so you
hold that and then press that that's
that's fairly standard you're gonna have
a 12 hour display with the alarm active
just shown and the alarm time set em
p.m. okay cool cool cool so that's odd
let's get this opened up here so we've
got some four strings on the back that
I'm gonna go ahead and just
because this clearly isn't gonna work
for me if I even can cut them which it
would appear that I cannot because they
are held together by the force hey I'm
okay
I'm only bleeding a little bit all right
Anakin that's it it's on now yeah see
just a little bit not too bad my hands
are nice and cold so it's not flowing
too freely here well that was some
pretty good stabbing with my unboxing
hobo knife here you like stabbing people
with nothing beats the unboxing life
okay here we go
oh yeah look at that it is a completely
poseable oh you can't turn the head or
pop it off okay that's okay
so there's your snooze button he's all
like keeping a rhythm there okay so
we're gonna go ahead and pull this out
whoa there goes the alarm cool so
there's the time here's the light oh we
got totally okay so look it's about to
get romantic okay
check that out yeah yeah hold on
all that wait for it to turn off so you
guys can see what it looks like when the
light turns off thank you yeah there you
go okay now let's take a closer look at
all the functionality back here so you
can turn the alarm on and off you can
set the time set the alarm hours and
minutes you can replace the batteries
here I sure wish this plugged into the
wall because then I think it would be
more useful as like a permanent alarm
clock because the last situation in the
world you want to deal with is your
alarm clock running out of batteries in
this it's criminal that it doesn't come
with a Lego lightsaber for him to hold
because that would take this from being
like an a-minus product to like an A+
product right there I mean we could try
and make him a lightsaber but I think it
just really wouldn't be the same besides
everyone knows Anakin has a different
color lightsaber than orange which I
can't remember it's probably blue though
oh yeah it's blue right because he
leaves it for Luke
Wow yeah I'm getting this
from slick like I can't believe you
didn't know that look it's a lot harder
to think about these things when you're
like trying to also talk about some kind
of product or something so here's Anakin
doing the split and being all like Jedi
and whatnot and he's all like landing
and then he's got both of his feet and
he's all like he's all like running over
video cards and he's all like you're a
test bench I will use force lightning
although he doesn't use Force Lightning
cuz he's still on the good side so that
study's all like your test bench I will
protect it and I think we're done here
