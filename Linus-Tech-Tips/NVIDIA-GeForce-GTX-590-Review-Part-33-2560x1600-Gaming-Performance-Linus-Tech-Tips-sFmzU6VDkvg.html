will be needing for my heavy weight GPU
battle that is my P 67 with core i7 2604
clock to 4.7 gigahertz my 8 gigs as much
can redline Ram I've got my 120 gig
Intel SATA 3 5 10 series SSD and I have
a 30-inch monitor supporting a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 so this is
the highest single monitor res that you
will typically find in a PC scenario
although it's fairly atypical most
people do not have 30 inch monitors
however the kinds of people who are
buying these $700 graphics cards often
have 30 inch monitors so that's why this
is fairly relevant now the reason that
these video cards re the reason that a
lot of people who own these video cards
have 30 inch monitors is that they're
very well made for each other
these video cards don't really stretch
their wings until you give them a
30-inch monitor to play in otherwise
they don't really separate themselves
from the rest of the pack and a 30-inch
monitor is not really able to perform
properly without a powerful graphics
card driving it especially if you want
to play the latest 3d games so for this
heavyweight showdown I will be taking
the 6990 and the GTX 590 and they will
be battling out like this no but really
I'll be doing benchmarks
you
so as you guys can clearly see from the
charts and graphs segments of the video
this isn't really a clear-cut decision
so the GTX 590 and the 6990 actually
trade blows depending on which title you
are most interested in running this
holds true at 1920 by 1080 as well as at
2560 by 1600 so it seems to be just
generally how these cards perform with
respect to each other so I mean the best
thing to do would be to find reviews and
find out if either card has a clear
advantage in the games that you do
prefer to play and you can make a
decision based on that but there are
also some other factors so each AMD and
NVIDIA have some advantages that are
unique to their cards that are different
from each other so both of them have a
similar similar cooling solutions in the
sense that they both use a central fan
that exhausts the majority of the heat
into your case so that's something that
you may or may not want to factor in the
mu1 probably exhaust a little bit more
out of the case because the Nvidia card
has this DVI port right here okay so
that's something that probably won't
weigh in on the next thing that I would
probably consider is power consumption
so the power consumption of the AMD card
is significantly higher especially under
load at idle the GTX 590 is a
substantially lower power consumption
card another thing to factor in is
definitely noise the 6990 is a
significantly louder card if you check
out my video I actually have one that is
either uploaded now or will be uploaded
soon depending when you're watching this
where I compare the acoustics of the GTX
590 with the acoustics of the $69.99 I
also look at the temperatures that they
run at you can factor in price price is
definitely something although they
should be priced fairly similar at least
at launch
similarly excuse me and then the other
thing would be unique features so unique
features
these two GPU makers are would be
eyefinity is the big one on the AMD side
so the 6990 actually supports up to five
displays so I've got a video up on my
NCIX comm channel where I actually run
five displays in portrait mode for five
times HD resolution and run some games
on that it looks pretty cool it's a very
neat gaming experience and then on the
nvidia side we've got 3d vision so 3d
vision is long stereoscopic 3d with an
NVIDIA ecosystem so you just have to
have a 3d vision supporting display
their projectors there were monitors out
there you have to have the 3d vision
glasses and then you have to have a
GeForce graphics card so they got 3d
vision they've also got physics so
there's a number of games that support
physics effects and last but not least
they've got CUDA so CUDA will allow you
to use your GPU to offload some compute
style calculations to your GPU no direct
compute is supported on AMD cards and
some some applications do take advantage
of that as well
so thank you for checking out my video
on the you know Babel of the heavy
weight Titan graphics cards and
hopefully you'll excuse me for my
mistakes while filming this after all it
is not very it is not a normal time of
day and I'm very tired
and I would really like to go to sleep
so you can I had everyone don't forget
