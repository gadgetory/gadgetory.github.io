got this there's a bunch of time a
little while ago but not a ton of news
but there is some news oh there is
definitely some news I missed something
all right well enthusiastic I am like
all upset about right to repair crap
right now oh yes so there was there okay
here what is that yeah Apple iOS 11.3
updated and left some repaired iPhones I
believe specifically third-party
repaired iPhones with with no touch
functionality when I first read this I
thought it meant like it wouldn't
fingerprint like oh okay no the screen
is no no much worse than that we're
talking iPhones that worked and were
bricked by software yeah
California is the latest state to
explore net neutrality protection after
the FCC repealed and Google Chat is set
to rival iMessage and displace SMS okay
that I really want to talk about too
because you know Al oh yeah yeah that
whole team was like disbanded now and
moved over to this okay Google just
straight-up cannot make them make up
their mind okay oh this I plan to talk
about for a fair bit so Oppo Oppo
digital to be clear Oppo digital not
Oppo is ceasing development of new
products and a few guys are thinking
what aren't they like a gigantic phone
manufacturer Oppo digital is not yeah
and this is important for a number of
reasons so we're gonna get into that
after the intro which will work maybe
yeah
Oh Oh some people don't like your don't
like your color my color their like it
looks like an Instagram filter oh oh oh
sponsors but it's meaning whatever what
do you think okay so here's the problem
it's hard to tell because this is a
gaming monitor and whoever's watching
might be on I don't know something else
something else but I can't tell you guys
that looking at it on my blade anyway
like kind of look like that in person
maybe it's a little richer maybe it's a
little rich it's not that far off though
like our shirts are actually you know
what it's it's not far off yeah I mean
part of why we look weird might be that
we are really popping out as colorful
against sort of a more have like neutral
set will this work I guess that would do
that either way but there's a light like
like I can almost touch it yeah do that
and there's one on that and I would
almost be able to touch this one if my
arms were long because I wasn't a small
human yeah it's it's a very different
setup than normal
ah I haven't even seen you this week no
I barely this week like what is going on
I've barely slept this week I went to
bed at 5 in the morning last night I
skipped my stream on Wednesday I'm
skipping my stream tonight this has been
a rough rough week we'll make it though
next week is looking good if I get if I
get everything done this weekend next
week is looking good ok sweet so this is
all floatplane stuff yeah yeah so I had
what I thought were some really good
updates for you and then I think I ended
up crapping on you you did towards the
second that was a good little bump
partway through the week so you know
it's okay there is a lot going well just
we're not explaining any of this stuff
yeah I talk about most of it which isn't
very help yeah we're
we're still progressing things are going
well there's the PayPal option on the
new site should be ready fairly soon
there's been a lot of minor fixes that
have coming up there was one that a lot
of people are complaining about which
took us a little while to kind of figure
out but the resolution selection was not
showing up for all the people with ADD
blog yeah it shouldn't matter there's no
ads on flow plane it shouldn't matter
but for some reason that was a thing so
we ended up fixing that which was I
don't think clear that wasn't something
we were doing intentionally no it was
just it was something to do with the
element that is our resolution control
thing looked like a third party thing
being loaded or something like that
yeah so that's now been fixed so that's
good yeah so so and there's been out
there like there's been a lot of
improvement things my like personal week
like doing the stuff that I do was just
rough the platform is doing great this
my like stuff was has been and when
PayPal rolls around by the time by this
time next week by wine show next week I
think we'll have a new creator to
announce yeah
maybe two depending on whether one of
them who I'm just gonna say it who is a
little bit lazy one of them who's a
little bit lazy depending on whether
that one gets back to me with some
paperwork whatever I would tell that
person to their face yeah are you asking
yeah dog he knows what's up hey hey look
look
I wouldn't say everyone's gonna know I
wouldn't say anything about anyone on
wine show that I wouldn't say to their
face because I know that watching wine
show if they weren't too lazy is pretty
straightforward I don't think anyone's
he's probably just got lots of other
important things as well
look I've heard it from this person's
manager I've heard it from this person
directly and I have made I have made my
own observations about okay I like this
person very much
me too Wilbur say disparaging dairy it's
not disparaging has to be untrue okay
very talented creator could probably be
much bigger
if the sleeves got rolled up a little
more often
Wow that's a compliment that's a
compliment
kind of it's a backhanded compliment oh
it's a pat on the back with a spiked
globe it's a subset of compliment can we
agree on that all right
oh my goodness well you guys I want to
hide behind me I'm coming back I'm
coming back I got this oh man um okay
why don't why don't we jump right into
one of our bigger topics of the day
so this Widgeon Allart achill here is
from motherboard vice.com
oh by the way go ahead and pop this up
here sharing in the chat and bringing up
on screen and talking about stuff it's
difficult when you're gone thank you for
coming back oh yeah oh you're very
welcome I was a lot of stuff to do I was
in China last week that was a lot of fun
we had a lot of people ask us if we were
planning a collab with strange parts and
no we weren't planning a collab oh yeah
okay
yeah oh you know what I guess I guess I
better just what no I thought that one
was an accident but the cable management
on my mouse is a little tight here I was
so excited and you made me so sad for
such a short period of time but okay we
were not planning a collab but actually
I had one of the best in flight
experiences I have ever had on my way to
China so I did a daytime flight for a
change instead of a red-eye so I was
awake for the plane ride yeah and my
wife I was banging I was getting one
megabyte per second downloads for like
long stretches of what was a nine or 10
hour flight or whatever it was yeah dog
it was nice to China from here yes sir
Wow and they did warn me that there
would be some
some kind of sketchy spots over Russia
and over China itself but they actually
were very short and speeds were just
slower not bad okay yep so I was really
impressed and so I got a lot of work
done I actually got something like 200
emails done while I was on that flight
including several to Scottie cool so we
actually synched up while I was on my
way over there and we ended up working
out a plan for getting together and what
we ended up doing was exploring the sort
of the electronics market in Shenzhen
yeah because I saw your tweet saying you
were doing that with them so when you
said you you didn't do a thing else
really confused no no we did get
together it's called a kwok-hung day
Hawk Wang Bay whatever okay my Chinese
is not great I made him say it in the
video yeah just like yeah it seems to be
quite good it's okay
I took my favorite thing is when he says
something I'm like wow I'm impressed and
then the person like does a little like
shuffle back slightly and then responds
in English and I'm like come on he tried
so hard that sounded so good ouch
yeah so so we got together and we
started out just kind of like poking
around but what I realized was that
place is so fast and there is so much
stuff in it that it is like it's
overwhelming yeah like it's completely
overwhelming like it if you want laser
pointers that can burn stuff you can
find that if you want what are
apparently really cool microscopes I'm
not much of a microscope nerd but what
are apparently like super cool
microscopes you couldn't you can get
that stuff I know Lou from unbox therapy
ended up like going on a shopping spree
ultimately but I'm not much of a shopper
I actually buy very little stuff other
than like yeah you too yeah oh I thought
you were gesturing
you know something okay yeah but like
we're both kind of cheap
so I'm not the kind of person who just
like walks into a mall and it's like oh
wow I need to buy all the thing my mom
bought me this shirt thank you mom
so what I realized is I needed an
objective so what I found out was that
his editor is actually based in Mexico
okay and is running like a very very
like very run-of-the-mill and not
current-gen editing system so I was like
how about this let's see if we can build
a system here a video editing system for
cheaper than if we just ordered it off
newegg.com okay so certain parts like
graphics cards for example mining by the
way huge in Foshan Bay I know I said it
wrong I'm sorry but whatever huge that
huge in China in general so if we had
wanted mining stuff then there's lots of
selection but mining pricing and then
the effect that mining has on pricing of
components like GPUs is pretty much sort
of what it is it's like it's like people
who travel expecting to get a deal on a
gold bracelet yeah it's like Gold's a
commodity it costs what it costs and you
can pay in whatever sort of rupees or
shekels or or dong or whatever you can
pay in whatever currency you want you're
still ultimately paying what you're
paying so certain components like
graphics cards there were not deals to
be fair but then there there are other
things like I found this like 1600 watt
power supply that was like 80 bucks oh I
didn't buy that one cuz I picked it up
and I was like oh wow that's far too
late for what you think there is nothing
in there but like cases you think given
that they're probably manufactured up
the road that cases would be pretty
cheap so it turns out cases are actually
well okay the case is a cool part of the
video okay you're gonna enjoy them so
anyway I was like okay let's build an
editing workstation for his editor and
then halfway through he's like you know
what screw my editor I'm gonna give the
system away to my viewers
so what I think what's actually gonna
happen is he's got a video of kind of
his side of this whole interaction and
he filmed so stealthily I even asked him
at the end I was like did you film
anything he's like oh yeah I felt like
most of it I'm like wow you know he's
always doing that stuff for us he's like
puts his camera on the counter he's got
those like that guy is stealthy here
like a tall white dude in China so he's
got his side and we've got our side and
then he's going to be doing a giveaway
of the system that we built to one of
his viewers because I don't know I don't
know if people know this in general but
he's trying to go full-time youtuber I
didn't know that yeah like that has been
his intent okay so what looked like just
sort of a weird side project was
actually just a pretty focused pretty
smart dude making some super explosive
videos to get his channel kick-started
okay yeah yeah if you guys don't somehow
know who we're talking about it's Scotty
from strange parts you trigger the
strange parts YouTube channel yeah so
he's more likely to be recognized as the
guy who built his own iPhone out of
parts or the guy who invented a iPhone
jack or a headphone jack do it iPhone
all right
people are gonna be like people are
gonna be flipping their crap okay one
spoiler we end up with a Rison system oh
cool cool yeah all right so uh let's go
back to what I was planning to talk
about which is the new iOS update that
right right this this is what got me
talking about him because his whole
thing is like hacking phones apparently
so anyway new iOS at iOS update killed
touch functionality on iPhone 8
motherboard got vice.com you guys got to
be careful cuz that looks like iPhone
8's that does that does quite directly
look like iPhone 8 it I know it is
technically not grammatically correct
but if you throw an apostrophe in there
people will know sort of inherently that
you mean iPhone 8 oh it's a comment
that's not what they mean wow yeah
there's no iPhone 8's yeah
I know so yeah if you if you put the
apostrophe in there like little pro tip
it's incorrect but people will know what
you mean at least yeah or you can do
iPhone 8 phones or something like that
but I don't know if that's good for SEO
but then they don't have that Nash's
weird yes sort of a bad idea anyway so
what went down here was Apple rolled out
iOS eleven point three and if you've if
you've ever sort of looked into write to
repair and apples reputation around this
whole movement this probably won't
surprise you that much because they've
been known to do things like not provide
third-party repair shops with the with
the tools that they need in order to
retain touch ID functionality on iPhones
with replaced home buttons and this was
far more of an issue with a phone like
the iPhone 6s which had a hardware touch
button or excuse me a hardware home
button that was not solid-state so they
switched to the solid state button with
the seven which is much harder to break
whereas those those clicky buttons no
that was a pretty common piece to end up
damaged on the iPhone leading up to that
time so so what would happen was people
would take it into a third-party repair
shop and they would have a perfectly
authentic button and a perfectly
authentic phone and they would put them
together but without Apple's special
sauce they wouldn't be able to make it
work even though that has nothing to do
with the secure Enclave that actually
holds the fingerprint information this
was just Apple being restrictive because
they can be restrictive so anyway the
issue affected phones that had their
screens replaced with aftermarket
displays ie not repaired by an Apple
Authorized facility and it is believed
to be because of an incompatibility
between a small chip that controls the
screen and the aftermarket displays so
it's possible this is an accident it is
possible that it is something Apple did
on purpose but either way one is saying
that our ' thing thing is not incorrect
it's an exception and you can put it
after a number if it's a single-digit oh
well thank
John Martin appreciate that okay so my
confusion there though would be if it
was an iPhone 10 yeah you would say
iPhone tens yeah but in text yeah but
you would say so
oh X because it's a single digit oh
right it's an X yeah that's still not a
digit yeah so in this case yeah our
little thing works for yeah
grammatically correct hooray
attends gonna wreck everything so I
guess this whole this whole reaching the
topic of broaching reaching broaching
whatever on the topic of right to repair
yes I will have a response I don't know
if you've been following this drama but
we did a video on how our I Mac Pro is
still broken and Wow
pretty much everyone and their dog has
made a response one of the news articles
about it on an Apple sort of centric
news site has a thousand comments on it
yeah Wow like this when this went viral
and sort of very general sentiment the
general consensus depends on who you ask
if people are more of like if they're
more in sort of the techie PC DIY crowd
they're like wow this is ridiculous yeah
if they're in the not that crowd
Cupertino crowd let's let's call it that
if they're in the Cupertino crowd then
it's my fault for not reading the terms
and conditions that stipulate that Apple
doesn't have to repair something that
has been modified by a third party so
okay I actually have a lot of notes made
for this video already will be
addressing the vast majority of the
comments that people have made deciding
we don't do that that of articles that
have been written well the actually we
wouldn't be doing it except that we
still need to fix the freaking iMac Pro
so that's in progress we are working on
a solution that will allow us to get
parts and fix
okay uh it's gonna be a weird solution
and we're gonna be talking about the
hoops that we've had to jump through in
order to get there some of the hoops
that were available that we chose not to
jump through whether because they were
too expensive or too sketchy or whatever
else the case may be but this this saga
is far from over
well there is one thing that I
absolutely want to address now and tell
you what I haven't screen shot at
anything yet so if you're one of the
tool sheds out there who posted that
this was the reason that they denied the
repair and go back and edit your comment
and you won't end up in the video okay a
shocking number of people said that even
though Apple never said this and it's
nowhere in the screenshots and it's
nowhere in the policy and it's certainly
not in the video a number of people have
concluded that Apple didn't repair it
because the cost of the parts I mean you
guys totaled this thing the cost of the
parts is so high that it's more than
just buying a new machine anyway so you
should just buy a new machine what are
you stupid okay even if all of the parts
that we listed in the video the display
the mainboard and the power supply even
if they're all dead which they may very
well not be you can actually have a
component short out and be protected by
the on-board circuitry that does exist
in some cases if you get lucky you can
actually have sparks fly off the board
and have it live for years even if all
of the components that we think could
possibly be dead are in fact dead that
is a $5,000 machine you got to be
drinking some pretty freakin amazing
kool-aid to think that a monitor a
motherboard and a power supply are worth
$5,000 it's at least a $3,000 powers for
$3,000 power supply is out you get off
my show never get off my show you don't
even work here
that's fair the CPU alone is like five
seven hundred dollars yeah the 32 gigs
of DDR for ECC Ram yeah that has the
value it's expensive the chassis
remember this is an Apple chassis it's a
special chassis that costs money the SSD
the dual SSDs those are still good so
people are running in going well I mean
you broke this stuff total write-off
total write-off that that's why they
wouldn't replace it the cost was too
high and I had one I had one guy being
luck that's like you know it's gonna be
$300 of labor plus the cost of these
parts is more than the cost of the
system pretty drunk oh man like the
amount of like the amount of worship
that goes on here just boggles my mind
it baffles me anyway there will be a
video I promise it will be epic and I
don't know if I'm ready to promise this
yet but we are definitely working on
flying mr. lewis Rossmann out here Oh
help me put this thing back together
okay that would be awesome so I have
nothing else to say about it until the
video comes out but it's gonna be fun
we're gonna have some fun we're gonna
really cool you know I don't drink but
well well well figuratively pop some
brewskis and fix an iMac Pro and talk
about how that's going and it's gonna
it's gonna be a good thing it's gonna be
a good thing for you yes a tournament
brewskis for me oh my that bat have you
already started turn that that bullet
alright
speaking of drinking hey by the way what
time do we start tomorrow okay I'm just
making sure
I said I've been very busy are you

some savage Turkey okay and then I'm
going to change I'm gonna leave that
Savage tricky went on for a bit I'm just
gonna have a time delay it's like
rooting through like a treasure chest
I know right they sent so much maple
buffalo bacon and I'm so excited I'm
gonna have some but I'm gonna have some
of the sriracha bacon first I mean I
meant no I'm not no I'm not sharing that
kind though it's for me they sent it
because they know I liked it they didn't
send it because they know you like it
edie maybe if they send even more next
time I will consider sharing the maple
muff buffalo bacon yeah actually yeah
well I'm gonna put this over here you
know what I'm gonna put it right next to
me okay so it's not being hidden it's
being put in like a high threat area
that's right you got close you're gonna
get swatted yo no not that
I don't know we're on the platform that
that is like popular on savage jerky is
made with that was pretty savage without
nitrates or preservatives their goal was
to create snack that's full of flavor
and not bad for you mmm I've got 13
different flavors of jerky some of the
favorites are sriracha Bacon's was
actually really good I don't know if
I've tried this one before this is
really good their maple buffalo bacon
the traditional Moho Mohawk flavors are
fantastic
aside from Turkey they make barbecue
sauce hot sauce and a spice rub their
Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of
the hottest peppers in the world the
bell haha I think I've made that joke
before but whatever it's the Carolina
Reaper it's right in the name and you
can use offer code LTTE to save 10% over
at Savage jerky dot-com not move really
good
dang through out your bacon that's right
yes uh-huh
technically only claims the maple
buffalo bacon uh-huh huh only one piece
I might claim this in the future though
really nice all right so the original
article here is from Ars Technica calm
but it would appear as though California
is the latest in a number of states that
are exploring net neutrality bills to
protect net neutrality in spite of
what's going on with the federal
government so basically they're
attempting to restore net neutrality
provisions that are similar to the ones
that were used by the FCC before their
recent repeal however in addition to
prohibiting fast lanes throttling
blocking and paid prioritization they
want to go a step further to prohibit
zero-rating which is when the use of a
certain site such as Netflix doesn't
count against a user's data cap now I
have mixed feelings about zero rating
it sounds cool like at first the issue
with it the big the big issue with it is
say one of these ISPs owns a service
which is really common they could zero
rate their own service so that you
subscribe to them instead of someone
else so John's coming but in the
meantime I want to present my he's
deleted all his notes I wanna I wanna
okay I want to present my sort of dumb
consumer who's very selfish sort of
point of view and go well I can see
things about this that I would really
like because zero rating can be applied
in that way where someone like a Comcast
might say that okay you know watching
watching shows from Comcast who owns
Comcast again or who does Comcast own or
NBC okay so you know NBC streams don't
count against your data usage but there
are cases of zero rating where they
aren't implementing it on their own
services like for example t-mobile yeah
allows I think it's a YouTube streaming
doesn't count against your data plan
well I mean Google doesn't own t-mobile
and vice versa this is just a handshake
deal which again on the surface can look
really good for consumers because hey
you can watch all the YouTube you want
if you're a t-mobile copy erratically
that hurts like twitch and whatever else
but or some you know young upstart video
streaming platform
hey and that doesn't have a chance to
talk to t-mobile about such an
arrangement so Jordans gonna tag in for
me and talk in a little bit more detail
about oh that was why you're here right
yeah feel free to explain it in better
detail than one okay so we're looking at
we're looking at the California bill on
neutrality right yeah though okay so um
which way which bullet point early on
because the last bullet point is here we
we've we've only gone through a few of
them but we've talked about this kind of
thing on the show before so I think a
lot of people kind of know okay
especially what's going on okay so um
so you talked about your writing already
right yeah so okay so right now the bill
is that it got passed by like this
little subcommittee or something in
their estate house okay um so it still
has to be passed by both chambers signed
into law and all that but both chambers
and the governor's mansion they're
currently controlled by Democrats who
traditionally have been more friendly
towards net neutrality so we'll see what
happens with it um right now ISPs are
unsurprisingly opposing the bill and
they also might challenge it in court if
it does indeed become law there are a
number of legal arguments they could use
to try to get this scrapped and this is
interesting not only because California
is such a huge state but since the FCC
repeal a few months ago I think they've
gone so far they've gone further than
any other states have and trying to have
like a real sort of like comprehensive
neutrality law right so what I put down
here was they might argue on federal
preemption or that the bill unduly
burdens what is federal preemption so
that is when a federal law and a state
law come into conflict okay and there's
a number of ways that can happen
obviously there are very clear cases
where the federal law says one thing and
the state law says exactly the opposite
so you don't need to be a lawyer to
understand that but there's also cases
where it's a little more subtle this
being one of them so what happened when
the FCC repealed the net neutrality
protections a few months back they they
specifically said we need to return to
the light touch regulation of the
internet and this is exactly what we're
doing so is it really actually
pre-empting anything if in lines I'm
going to reach over the desk here and
steal some more sriracha bacon jerky I
don't blame them that stuff is delicious
but but it's good yeah it's okay anyway
so um well federal back in you like
bacon grab okay so do we just right yes
okay well so they're trying to the sec
is saying they're trying to regulate the
internet less give the ISPs a little
more leeway yeah but the question here
then becomes is there does that mean the
federal government is intending to in
law they call it occupying the fields
does does the federal government in
and to regulate this area so heavily
that the states can't do anything about
it but in their own order they said
we're trying to regulate this less
heavily and scrap these net neutrality
regulations so that that would be a very
interesting like battle in court yeah
okay yeah so they're saying like we we
we don't want to regulate this as much
but they're aggressively not regulating
and trying to make sure that no one else
can either well I don't know if they're
consciously trying to do that but what
I'm saying is like when when a big like
ISP takes the state of California to
court and says they can't do this they
might try to argue that the federal
government has tried to occupy the fuel
somehow it might not be a great argument
but I expect them to try it the other
thing they might argue is which they
might be more successful with is saying
the bill unduly burdens interstate
commerce which is which is a which is a
constitutional argument but basically
it's so I know right yeah so but the
idea is that one state can't um can't
meddle in the affairs of how other
states only conduct commerce between
them so okay so like if you're if you're
importing like what let's use a simpler
example let's say you're importing a
bunch of bacon jerky let's say the state
of North Carolina is importing a bunch
of bacon jerky um like from another
state or from another country from
another state okay um so they're
actually that would make sense because I
think savage jerky is based out of
Georgia so it will be a quick trip
anyway so let's say they're reporting a
bunch of bacon jerky and they have
regulations on bacon jerky without makin
turkey bacon turkey bacon jerky bacon
jerky talk about a summon lioness so
anyway so let's say there's regulations
that the state of NC has on bacon jerky
let's saying that they can't have but so
many preservatives they have to be at
least 95 percent beef or whatever else
right this is just a random made-up
example yes it's a hypothetical decision
it's Friday it's been a long week okay
anyway every good thing to regulate then
so so let's say they have one set of
regulations for bacon jerky produced in
state and another set for bacon jerky
they're importing from Georgia so that
would be that would be against the
Constitution you can't do that but if
the same rules apply to everybody will
be okay okay
this is a little more complicated
because I could see AT&amp;amp;T Verizon Comcast
whoever else walking into court and
saying that even though the law because
I actually read the law a little bit and
it applies to any ISP that has customers
in California which makes sense but they
could argue something about oh the
Internet is so decentralized and because
of that this isn't like just importing a
product or whatever and this is placing
an undue burden on Interstate Commerce
whether that would win I have no idea
but I do expect a lengthy court battle
so okay so there you have it the
internet is not like bacon jerky well
thank you John if this is the legal
corner with John yes thanks John yep man
the states are weird yeah I know it's
trippy I've never fully understand how
life works 52 or like maybe but not 52
because there are also like territories
or something and then 50 50 states but
then like what is it
yeah what are the ones that aren't
states because there's yeah Guam Puerto
Rico what are those like home but there
and they're all kind of like little
countries except that they're one
country sort of except when they like
want to do things that the ones running
the one country don't like them or that
they don't like and then I don't know
and they can like actually fight about
that whereas in most other countries
it's just like no this how it works
since hours it's interesting it's
confusing for someone who's isn't from
there and didn't like grow up in the
system
I think it's confusing for the people
there to google chat yeah the original
article here is from Tom's guide Wow
okay you had a comment that all the the
alo team was dissolved and brought over
here apparently yes this is not the
first time this has happened
do you think this is the last time man
I don't know what to tell you because
the article that I was reading about
this basically had like a timeline of
the whole experience of Google and chat
applications going all the way back to I
think Google Talk was the first one so
to give people a little bit of
google chat is a newly proposed thing
from Google as a set to rival iMessage
and displace SMS which is probably the
exact same lines that we've had with
previous chat applications from Google
but they are taking a different approach
this time so to be clear this is not
Google Talk turning into g chat turning
into was then integrated with hey with
google+ and then turning into hangouts
and then ello hello and the other one in
there was there another one what was the
other one at least like two I remember
last time the most confusing thing was
that they released two at basically the
same time and they were only marginally
different yeah and like something else
I've had a hard time keeping track of
exactly what's been going on and yet
like I just I find the whole experience
of both SMS and chat on Android very
frustrating because the feature sets are
divergent in like little stupid ways so
for example the messages team like you
know just the default vanilla stock
Android I shouldn't say vanilla because
that might be an Android it's like the
stock Android messages app it's like so
back ass words in some ways we're like
like it doesn't have cloud backup I'm
gonna sound wise around YouTube
demoralization saying it that way
bass-ackwards so it's like it's so
backwards it doesn't even have cloud
backup which just blows me away but
that's not completely automatic when I
switch from one Android phone to another
one all my SMS messages are gone but
that team apparently still exists
because it must I don't think it was
that long ago that they looked at how
well a lot of people are busy using
facebook messenger because SMS is sort
of trashed by today's standards and
basically the only thing they're using
SMS for is verification codes so when
you get your notification for messages
it has mark as read
we're just like awesome so you never
have to touch it again you don't have to
click through it to mark it as read you
don't have to if you swipe it away it
doesn't stay unread Oh some
that is pretty great hey yo this doesn't
have that Gmail doesn't have that and
pretty much I mean pretty much any app
now it's just notification spam as far
as I can tell and so the ability to mark
a notification is red when it comes in
without actually opening the
notification very nice if I can the more
I can do in the notification tray the
better because I could just do
everything I need to without even
opening anything that's fantastic so
also the the app I was thinking of was
duo which was their video chat thing so
they launched a low-end duo and pretty
much the same time and they were both
for communicating yeah okay but this is
not this is not like like a new app
that's just another hangouts or a low
replacement or whatever the case may be
this is more of a back-end
upgrade yeah so they're calling a
patient services what what is this yeah
rich communication services so unlike
SMS it'll support video it'll have read
receipts it'll support higher res images
and the mobile networks will have to
opt-in but the idea is that and you know
the funny thing to me why do people even
care about iMessage that much iMessage
is great what are you talking about
what's great about it I don't know it
just feels nice it goes quick you can
tell what phone they have which is cool
I don't know every time I've had an
iPhone I like that message right but did
it really make a difference to you one
way or the other if the bubble was blue
or green I mean as some SMS sucks as you
know mm-hmm how much better really is
facebook chat it's not it's not the only
reason i use facebook chat is so i
message is great because it's fine
yeah but facebook chat has a built-in
phonebook I don't that's what's useful
about facebook chat yeah I don't have
everyone on Facebook right but if you
wanted to find someone that's the point
of a phonebook yeah I don't want to add
Facebook to having access to all my
stuff though you don't have to you just
you just search Facebook for a person
when you're like oh right that person
and you contact them like that's what I
mean by a phonebook not an address book
okay like you'd like a directory
that's the only reason I give any apps
whatsoever about Facebook contact that
way on Facebook I don't like people that
I like met at badminton once and like
want to play with again sometime but I
didn't exchange phone numbers with them
but I remember their name because it'll
come up automatically because they'll be
friends with a bunch of other badminton
people okay so it'll know like if I'm
searching for Andy it'll be like oh yeah
probably this Andy even though you don't
have them in your contacts I've never
used that yeah it's like super useful or
like if there was someone that you'd go
aside you ran into at a LAN party or
something it might no aren't cool
anymore I know and I wish they were I
would love this
so it might know from their association
with other gamers that that's the you
know Tom Smith that you were most likely
to be looking for so it's just it's
that's why I use that that's the only
reason I care about that iMessage other
than an emojis which is a completely
artificial lockdown Thank You Apple
there's no reason why you couldn't send
an emojis as a video clip in hangouts
for example I just don't want you to I
don't really get it what's so amazing
about it maybe people are telling you in
twitch chat what's really there isn't
much else though group messages on
iMessage and whatsapp are much better
than SMS okay that's fine but whatsapp
has that and you can do that on Facebook
Messenger I messages end-to-end
encrypted SMS is open to snooping my age
is much less creepy okay so if you care
about that then you can be using a
third-party messaging service in general
because I message is just automatically
turned on and turned off depending on
who the what kind of film the other
person has so it's like it's it's like
only like sometimes running your VPN
when you talk to like some people so I
don't really get that either I don't use
desk discord that we're talking about
privacy so okay yes integration with the
desktop experience that is a good one
facebook Messenger same thing let's app
same thing hangout same thing people are
like it just works it kind of does yeah
it kind of does but like and I know it's
a funny tagline but it kind of does just
sort of work it just sort of works the
way you would expect SMS to but it
doesn't okay I mean
so then in a nutshell chat it's like a
back-end upgrade to SMS that other
messaging apps this is cool like
Samsung's messaging app will support
Google actually has a fair number of
partners sign didn't sign on for this
thing so like I mean I guess I'm excited
and that's cool
but I just yeah I guess that's cool I
don't know I just I don't feel like I
message needed to be something that had
to be competed with apparently it does
I do and I guess maybe what I'm
forgetting is that a lot of people like
when I messaged my mom she doesn't have
whatsapp or Facebook Messenger even or
anything like to her text messages text
message and so if this upgrades the text
message experience that normies are
probably just using by default because
they don't know anything else then I
guess that's good but even then we're
still not gonna have perfect coverage
because we're gonna be relying on iOS to
Android and vice versa to kind of
translate to each other but maybe Apple
and Google will find a way to cooperate
on that I'm not sure I haven't looked
into it carefully enough to know if
that's yeah oh yeah right right here in
Tom's article there's no clue as to
whether or not Apple will support chat
so there you go it's apparently less
secure than Apple's own service so might
be unlikely
it seems pretty secure it does
everything you really need it to do and
it works all the time and it feels
smooth and nice I don't know
I like that message it was one of the
saddest things about leaving an iPhone
was I was like oh I have to go back to
like this weird junk it's just so weird
cause like when Lou did that video at
CES where he asked a bunch of creators
what phone they're actually using a
couple people I think might maybe was
just one I don't know at least one
person brought up iMessage and like all
my friends are on I message and so I
asked off-camera I was like why does
that matter I mean yeah yeah I'm not
sure yeah I'm like okay I didn't use it
enough to actually you know have an
iPhone is just really excellent branding
because even at attack
content creator and I'm not gonna name
who they were but tech content creator
tech tuber didn't know why he cared
about iMessage it's just my my whole
thing was it was very smooth it's I'd
like the idea of text messages I like
the idea of default apps I've always
liked the idea of default apps I like
default experiences I like a pixel
because it is stock Android I would love
to use the stock Android SMS thing but
it's Garbo I still have to use it kind
of because like my upstairs neighbors
bless their wonderful Souls use
old-school text messages and it's kind
of jank for that and there are a few
other people in my life that I have to
use that for I use Facebook Messenger
for a lot of my stuff but that sucks not
only is it like scraping everything it
uses a really odd amount of battery life
it's terrible in a lot of other ways
I've got people saying that it's a
status symbol yes okay that's not why I
like it but some people do see it that
way
if you pop up in the iMessage would be
like I have an iPhone color like a
positive thing I didn't even remember
which one it was
I use it for very short periods like I
did know that I really liked my iMessage
experience I texted more people when I
was on an iPhone because I had iMessage
and I texted less people when I was on
an Android because I didn't have my
message because the stock texting things
sucks so bad I used to have something
called go SMS Pro like a long time ago
when texting was still really popular
because the default Android messaging
thing was so garbage that I gotta go SMS
Pro but then something happened there I
don't know what it was and they were bad
I think I just hate everyone who has
these problems because they clearly have
social lives and I don't you know you're
the one that wants you're the one that
needs the like I know at those people
the address-book
know I know in in freaking messengers
well I didn't say it's been often so
many people okay it was so many but you
need to look them up I can prove to you
that it's like three ever actually
well I'm at zero okay so you're winning
by a lot
speaking of zero that's how many new
products will be developed by Oppo
digital so this was posted on the forum
by someone Nick the Majin Nick the major
man whatever that is my gene very sad
day op oh and this is Nick's editorial
Oppel made the best video players on the
market with superb build quality and
fantastic customer support guess the
market just wasn't there for the higher
end product I love my UDP 203 and I hate
to think that my next player will have
to be made of cheap plastic from the
likes of Sony or Samsung so for those of
you not familiar Apple was a brand that
I already couldn't understand why they
existed back in like 2012 2011 so this
when I was a product manager back in
NCIX and one of my fellow product
managers was gonna bring in these
high-end DVD players and blu-ray players
with the argument being that they had
sort of fancy upscaling technology and
and stuff and they were they were very
expensive and I kind of went are you are
you effing kidding me like DB like
high-end DVD players that's that's kind
of like that's kind of like trying to
sell premium cassette tapes as far as
I'm concerned for which I'm sure there's
a market but oh they're totally in the
okay let me come up with something
better true wave how about like I think
it's called retro how about like stylish
dad sandals like okay I would you know
and okay um working on this okay so
there's a niche for almost anything but
not for this apparently anymore synth
wave or new retro wave they like
cassette tapes okay
so we've gotten past the point where
anyone or at least enough people to
sustain this company care enough about
fancy upscaling features and better
build quality on their physical media
players now I do still buy blu-rays
periodically because it
is it does look a lot better than
streaming but man is blu-ray ever going
to get replaced like will there be a
successor or are we just done I think
we're done huh
I mean it's at the point now where it's
just people have kind of voted with
their vault well it's they they want
cheaper they don't want higher quality
and it's gotten to the point where I
think the cheaper option is so much
cheaper that a lot of people don't think
it's worth it so they're still going to
be providing support and doing updates
but I mean to be fair like a high-end
blu-ray player I think is a little bit
harder to explain the value of a lot of
people are gonna yeah go with like their
PlayStation yeah or whatever I sure
would build a box 1s yeah exactly that's
what I'm saying that a PlayStation
doesn't
oh no blu-ray player and the ps4 pro
right didn't brilliant yeah but like
yeah they I feel like they would go with
what held on I might be I might have
that wrong yeah I played a blu-ray and a
ps4 Pro like a lot even a probe that run
what is the stupid thing Ultra HD
sorry that was the stupid thing that I
had that it didn't have Xbox 1s has
support for 4k blu-ray the ps4 Pro does
and I was like wait a minute no no ps3
had blu-ray yeah that's pretty confused
for that but yeah I think people use an
existing device or they would rather go
buy something that I can do a bunch of
other stuff and play blu-rays instead of
something that just plays blu-rays
speaking of other things dead Intel's
smart glasses group gone the glasses
they were working on called vaunt looked
kind of like normal glasses and used a
low powered laser beam to be nuages into
the eye
so either intel is giving up on AR for a
while or they figured they were never
gonna get laser beams into your eye past
the regulatory bodies that pay attention
to that sort of thing which i think
honestly both of those options are
totally valid
because I think how is this not a much
more major topic well we're talking
about this okay g4s partner program is
well we kind of talked about it a little
bit last week but it looks like it's
official asus has announced the original
article years from hot hardware you
weren't here last week a week before I
don't know okay areas Ares there is
video cards no I read the article where
it was rumored and I talked about it on
wine show at some point okay but this is
it it's official ROG is out for a
Seuss's high-end gaming products that
feature AMD processors so this is Ares
which is a play on a Seuss's Ares with
an S not as ed high-end like dual GPU
and II Radeon cards that were like a
limited edition similar to their Mars
ones for Nvidia so just a summary for
those of you who aren't familiar the
program rewards partners with perks
including marketing funds special
promotions and extra engineering support
and Asus has not gone on the record
saying it joined the program but with
the release of Ares it is fairly clear
that Republic of gamers will only be
used on geforce cards and other products
containing an Nvidia processor
duh-duh-duh intense have you seen this I
have no idea what this is yeah it's just
stupid marketing um so yeah speaking of
stupid marketing junk that's it for the
ranch oh yeah the marketing junk show no
there's more to it than that
I ate turkey for half of the show yeah I
was gonna say we eat stuff they don't
pay extra for that though and drinks and
water it's just yummy yep cool till I
see you again next week same bat-time
same bat-channel
bye
I don't know what it is but like I
didn't even check the time but it's been
like exactly an hour and it's just
something about the land show that takes
exactly an hour I think part of it
honestly is James has written it so many
dogs now know John helped me this week
oh yeah forgot floatplane dang it
know what come back we're not--we're
going back yeah back coming back like
that after party but not after it's like
a post party but no I'm gonna I'm gonna
say that we didn't because we
technically talked what at beginning the
show but we didn't highlight the cool
things that are on it so we also did
here we go oh dang it I would probably
yep just sec there we go hey I'm still
here don't even I stop and start right
like we're just still going nice my
fingers are really mmm jerky though oh
I'm not making it much better by licking
them and then wiping them on my pants oh
yeah yes AJ you completely saved the day
good job all right let's see fi also I
noticed that you logged on to
battlegrounds at 258 local time so we're
gonna need to talk on Monday but thank
you for saving the day I appreciate it
okay then ah screen sharing with - let's
go ahead and put that there so what do
we have up there oh this is a tech
quickie that is actually a very unusual
looking thumbnail for a tech quickie
video interesting that's an unusual
looking host for a tech quickie video
actually John's done a lot of the
hosting on tech wiki lately and the
reception's been really good let's go
ahead and go back see how that ico
snappy that site isn't that beautiful
hey here's how we're hiring video in
case Colton gets fired you can't really
tell but he's like cowering it's great
okay yeah it's pretty wonderful ah this
went up simultaneously because there was
an embargo super no one cared hey about
rising - really yeah it was
it was not only not like a big momentum
spike for the channel but it was like
devastating yeah it like crushed the
channel this one is gonna blow up on
YouTube faster internet for free in 30
seconds and it works do you know about
cloud flares DNS yes yeah yeah so we
basically just show people how to change
their DNS to a faster okay no that's
cool I might say snappier well you know
you know you know what um I won't I
won't destroy my principles but I won't
compromise my principles but I might I
might be flexible technically you might
be I direct I don't think it's too
brutal I don't think this is far yeah
that's fine
self-driving car levels explain that to
know they're fast as possible that's
cool
it's really cool because a lot of people
don't realize that there's I think six
levels something like that six levels
like level four is not actually the end
yeah so that's really cool the ThinkPad
x1 carbon review is up oh I don't know I
don't know how much Intel's gonna like
this video Zeon W is basically that's
fun core I nine with ECC and by the way
here is pay another $700 please but it's
it's still worth watching the video we
go into it in more detail this video
ended up being like pretty brutal I was
thinking it was just gonna be me and
Dennis kind of like racing to build a PC
instead it was Dennis trying to build a
PC at all this video is actually
fantastic also AJ I know I'm just
yanking your chain
we we really mix things up a little bit
oh my so we kind of work so I'm baking
I'm baking a laptop cake that's kind of
the idea behind it
oh and these are all the things you want
in a you know yeah okay and so the point
that we're making is they went really
far with this just cuz you have the
right ingredients doesn't mean that you
actually make a delicious cake Wow
you might get a couple things wrong you
know
brutal so we've got the magic transition
they're not beaten that beautiful Alex
actually went and had a custom cake made
for this video Dell XPS 2018 and we're
gonna leave it there okay I haven't seen
that I need to see that that's pretty
good we've got the wearable keyboard and
mouse yes so it's a both a keyboard and
a mouse and it just fits on your hand
like that I think we're getting into our
that's I think yeah that's getting into
the stuff that's already released
matting yeah
well also Kyle's on the platform yeah
so he's got that probably went up on the
embargo oh wow oh yeah okay I that's not
fake no it's not that's real coolant it
is that's a problem yeah so at some
point we're gonna get this new button
fixed so that you can tell the
difference between stuff that's just
everything everything is new everything
ever upload is new everything is new the
new website um new thumbnail genuinely
there are some new things over
absolutely no new comment slow playing
