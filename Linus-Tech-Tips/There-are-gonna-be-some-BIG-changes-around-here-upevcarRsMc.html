the dankest cooling and PC modding
projects on the internet and it was my
hope that hiring Alex who actually has
some engineering background would result
in a significant improvement to the
quality of the aforementioned projects
but every time I ask him to do something
he's like well I could do that if only I
had the proper equipment why don't you
just ask for better tools instead of
just making me use crappy ones I don't
think you need that so is this the last
thing on your wish list because this is
one of the things you've been trying to
get me to get since what you started so
this is it Alex
whoo yeah no more excuses we have
officially procured everything you've
asked for so today's video is all about
setting up the brand-new Linus tech tips
workshop complete with CNC mill CNC
router laser cutter lathe I think we
have a sandblaster the mills not CNC but
whatever yeah and this video is brought
to you by pulse wave with pulse way you
can remotely monitor and manage your
Windows Mac or Linux machines from one
app create your free account today at
the link in the video description
now this video can't start without a
massive shout-out to Oh Canada supply
these guys have absolutely freaking
everything and they have hooked us up
with a fair bit of the gear that we're
gonna be using to kid out pretty much a
thousand square feet of this warehouse
unit so this is gonna be the workshop
which is crazy because I think it makes
you officially our most expensive
employee not compared to Brandon second
most expensive employee so here I was
trying to figure out where to start and
they did all the work for us
yeah oh I see why they want us to open
this first it's the storage cabinet that
everything goes in that way we're not
just opening things up and just
spreading them out on the floor they've
clearly watched our videos so we can
keep everything kind of organized
systems is that they tend to take up a
lot of space yeah this is like Christmas
except my parents never loved me this
much I don't know about yours
oh the envelope first to the Linus video
group teams applying your team with the
equipment you need for your workshop 2.0
video series has been a pleasure from
our 100% Canadian owned company to our
new friends at LG we want to recognize
the impression you made in the online
world that's nice oh and a packing slip
Oh
so that's everything you ordered yeah
spoilers holy crap coveralls and variety
of sizes blade feeler gage welding
gloves in everything from Excel down to
my size oh nice oh that's cute it's on
like a little pallet wood or something
you know there's a shocking amount of
our viewers that don't know that we're
Canadian so I guess we're setting the
record straight about that once and for
all yeah nothing no this is incredible
once we get all this set up we are gonna
have like a kiddo shop oh yeah we have
like almost everything that we need
besides all the other stuff we need to
buy what other stuff I don't know like
end mills lathe cutter chums that sort
of stuff
so although we got a lot of tools the
storage for those tools actually was the
most expensive bit no way really
yeah we tip it back up or does it say on
there how heavy those things are 125
kilos hey hey we did not bet yeah that's
like wow that's like 270 pounds yeah we
can fit a lot of stuff in those and it's
nice because like in the old workshop we
had those like cutouts on that board if
people at least tried a little bit okay
goggles
okay goggles caulk construction adhesive
let's not hate on the old workshop too
much let's just say this one's better
not that the old one was bad what even
is this that is a huge air compressor
why do we need such a big air compressor
that's the one that they recommended for
the idea is that is just going to sit in
the closet and we're going to have
airlines around the whole thing but we
compressed air at all of the different
machines and stuff neat this we probably
shouldn't ya know that can just stay
cool Miller lathe well no no damn don't
include that so why you talk us through
what this is I don't think this one's
from Oh Canada supply no this is a
classic Bridgeport mill it's a two
horsepower one and it comes with the Dro
so what's at the RO exactly digital
readout so that'll allow you to have
down to I think it's a tenth of a
thousandth of an inch in accuracy does
it say how old it is on there
nope just Lou but you figure it's from
sixties seventies sometime in there oh
my gosh so how much did we pay for this
guy this was about five grand Canadian
and it's from the 60s or 70s yep
I guess the good news about that is that
it's probably gonna continue to hold its
value reasonably well yeah these things
don't depreciate at this point so the
thing that a mill gives us is the
precision and power to work with metal
in a way that's not really possible with
our CNC router well it's basically just
like a huge drill press so you put
whatever your cutter is in right here
yeah and then you attach whatever your
work is to a vise yeah you put a water
block and then you're able to accurately
move back and forth like this so if you
were to build a make a water block out
of this thing are you like are you're
standing here for two hours yep and I
pay for that it would you probably
wouldn't be standing here for two hours
because it can remove a lot of material
at a time like yeah it can just like get
right in there you could come in with
like a big cutter like that and just go
right across the whole top at once so
this right here when I talk to a canada
tool supply i actually put in the
document as something that we don't
really need but would be super sweet and
this is a sandblaster yes this is the
sandblaster holy crap weighs 264 pounds
exactly does it come preloaded with sand
or is that just the weight of the actual
machine no I'm pretty sure that the like
57 kilos on top here is the sand I'm not
an idiot I know it well Miller length
will no no damn don't include that music
home tree filled with sand it's like
buying a water bottle gonna come with
water oh oh rip off rip off by the way
by a water bottle ltte store calm no
water included what the heck is this why
is it so heavy yeah this says 24 kills
this is 50 pounds but it's not much
bigger than a poster is it just a big
piece of steel it's a giant steel plate
you know what it probably is it's
probably a backsplash Wow
that is freaking heavy
I think I know what those are for now I
think it's literally a steel table
to weld on Oh which is why it's beside
this guy right here I'm unsure if the
arcs decay yep the arc station this is
just a station for welding what are you
gonna weld things I don't know whatever
we want yeah we're gonna weld things and
search really you have no idea
you requested a welder without holding
anything planned for it I have lots of
things that we could weld and slowly
we'll work out so fun facts you guys
Alex before he worked here one of the
things that made his resume stand out is
that he was heavily involved in
competitive like dune buggie building
there's actually some great footage of
him surviving some pretty spectacular
crashes so I figured either he's really
good at building safe dirt buggies or
his head is really solid either way I
want a net - behaviour I thought that it
was a bit ambitious yeah okay so are we
just gonna like leave this as it is for
now yeah that seems like a lot of my
problem hi I've straight-up never
unboxed a crate like this before yeah
maybe we can open that once we have more
things over here
sure like there must be something that
will open it you would think that no no
no that's gonna bend that don't do that
no I wasn't going to do that I was gonna
move on Oh
while you do that can I have some
buckets right here you sure can I think
that this is supposed to go on top of
the other ones what I want to know is
who are they're trying to keep out of
this thing like I feel like I'm
unpacking a dangerous caged animal or
something there it is boys
this is a lot bigger than it looked in
the pictures yeah do we have space for
this yeah are you sure yeah over there
well okay then I think I remember what
happened here I wanted to get the like
smaller one but they didn't have it in
stock at the time so there's like we
have this bigger one and like really if
I was buying them I think this one
wasn't a whole lot more expensive anyway
okay yep
this is like the Shelf inator five
thousand so this is more storage yeah so
you know how right now all of our like
blues and epoxies and like well does
this not seem a little overkill for
storing glue oh wow
see you just like oh yeah wow it can
hold all the things yeah like all of the
things so this guy right here I believe
us from 1974 and it's a Colchester I
think that one's three horsepower lathe
so this one is a bit larger than what we
would have needed but the reason that I
decided on it is that it has a lot more
safety features than some of the other
ones I don't know exactly what a lathe
does I don't think the last time I used
a lathe I was in wood shop so very
similar you just put your metal in here
or whatever you want and then instead of
a chisel you'll have like a lathe
cutting piece that comes in right here
and then you just
movies yeah maybe this you move that and
then this is able to move all around in
the different directions and then you
just kind of bring it into your piece of
metal and give a little County cut
things I never knew I needed I like this
one okay what next I don't know what the
heck is this thing
oh it's another storage cabinet okay why
don't we do that later yeah I've got
something more interesting back here
though I think this appears to be a 14
inch wood band saw so what do we need
this for we never do woodworking that
one will also do aluminum Oh which also
we do have storage for flammable goods
now which is pretty sweet oh that's cool
sorry now we just have like caution
explody stuff so having an actual like
legit cabinet for flammable goods it's
going to be really great
yeah people know if and sauce look like
actually it's like this one right here
it's a bigger and better okay so then I
guess this pallet here yeah but I feel
like that a lot of the fun stuff is on
this pallet right here says threaded rod
why do we have so much of it it's a and
mill folder okay so this is all the
cutting bits for the Melvin yep they
just kind of go in here and then yeah it
goes next top mode and cool oh nice our
uniforms for these projects are here
shop coats no more getting dirty super
rugged gloves coveralls I guess it's
just a bunch of coveralls nice in all
sizes including mine right yo smoke
actually I wear a medium coat just small
gloves can I see the small gloves this
is probably like small for like rugged
manly men yeah did we get any extra
small we didn't it's okay
what is this it's blue I like blue
oh this might be like one of those water
bottles that actually comes with water
look can you stop hating on our merch
yeah great
just uh so it's just a screwdriver bid
organizer with a nice handy legend at
the top so we can buy more of them or we
can lose some or whatever no matter what
you know where they go back no I wash
station Safety's important kids
screwdriver set what's in here okay yeah
thanks thanks screwdriver set I give it
20 minutes before one of these is lost
like we can't we can't lose our stuff
this time
what is here I'm there's one yes
haha oh we finally have a proper tap and
I set with your missing pieces and does
it have a handle for the tap oh it does
oh it has it we have everything so many
people have been complaining I've been
complaining thirsty
Wow and they've been complaining always
had this just in our workshop how long
has this been sitting here like two or
three months and here we have 20
kilograms of sand Oh first aid kit we
could meet it at any moment around here
biohazard dispose a little vinyl gloves
cool I have got some good stuff here oh
there we go
cordless high torque impact wrench
cordless drill slash driver corded
performance what is this it's like an
angle grinder but smaller oh so a dremel
it's like a dremel but with balls
plastic pipe shear yeah I wonder if that
will just be like we wanted to hard
light tubing it's like cordless angle
grinder giant charging station I knew
you'd think of everything more batteries
more batteries more batteries you be
careful with these new soldering iron
18 gauge metal shear I really use this
for well if you get a sheet of metal and
you want like a smaller piece you slurm
are cool and finally a little cute
compact vacuum there's still a lot of
stuff that we haven't seen yet well crap
 oh that's just welding accessories
so we have a bunch of different torch
heads for different sizes of wire that
you might use like in here tests
indicate test of what test of like how
far away you are from something so this
is a super duper precise instrument okay
so be careful with it so what you can do
is you mapped it to either like the mill
or the lathe and then you can measure
that's to a thousandth of an inch one of
the problems with our router right now
is that it isn't quite flat to the table
right and with that right there we'll be
able to trim it in to within a
thousandth of an inch whereas right now
we can just like bipolar danger do not
operate tags this is really important
because there's only a couple of people
in this building that should be in this
building this better be like a
congratulations for making it this far
nope it's a lot of time favorite Oh
screw extractor yay
these are kind of like your last hope if
you get one of these out you're probably
done already so I guess is this our last
one this is it this is all awesome so
this looks like your air hose nonsense
what no this is for welding oh this is
the actual welder oh so this is like a
pretty ballin welder ideally we would
have got like a MIG welder or something
but we have to do a lot of aluminum
stuff like that of PCs are hurt so I
figured that it was worth getting
something that can actually do aluminum
I'm with a TIG welder you hold the
filler rod with your hand and with a MIG
welder it does it automatically I
personally like take a lot more Oh
though it takes a bit more finesse
speaking of finesse the way I transition
into these sponsor spots this plate
makes magnet mounted metal prints that
are durable and don't require any power
tools in order to hang them they've got
over a quarter million different artwork
spanning a bunch of different styles and
influences and with their easy magnetic
mounting there's no holes in the wall
and you can easily replace them we plant
10 trees for every display purchased and
you can use code Ltd to save 15% through

our merch store which has cool shirts
like this one and that one in cool hats
like that one and our community forum
which you guys should totally join it's
gonna be a lot of work to set up yeah
see ya yeah okay have fun finding people
yes this way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
