the web show
it's a joke
what was look that's that bit there that
I just didn't oh I mean no going to
answer no no there it is the land show
and we are welcome there just aren't any
ladies oh we've got a great show for you
guys today
Intel is rumoured to be working on core
i9 processors so wow that's been what
seven years in the work since the
original rumors maybe this will finally
be over four cores on a consumer done
Nvidia announces the first well what do
we call it we can't call it a video card
because won't even have like video
output but but it's a it's a GPU okay
first Volta GPU it's the biggest they've
ever made and what else you got here I
don't know where it went but maybe
that's part of the whole deal there's
all here it is there's a NSA derived
ransomware worm but it's just going
everywhere and screwing huge companies
over and it's it's scary and bad and
we'll talk about that also where did it
go the UK police start using Minority
Report SK I to help decide the fate of
inmates
really apparently all right so let's
roll that intro and hopefully the world
is still here when we come back no
guarantees though horn huh
forecaster there longer than you
oh yeah LTX 2017 tech carnival pray get
conned on Saturday July 29th 2017
tickets on sale now that Wow
really what a good link we decided not
to shorten that at all what is ticket
rocket dotco slash event slash detail
slash nine seven two four six /l TX -
2017 if you can remember that heck yeah
yeah cuz it's gone Squarespace
what is dot co I mean I know don co dot
uk' but what oh wait hold on alright
oh wait no no everything for the show is
over now you played it twice oh crap
okay well thanks for tuning in see you
again next week
okay but in all seriousness we have some
huge news now that James underscore
gravity but at James underscore gravity
on Twitter is off probation he will
reply to all emoji sentences with an
emoji sentence only tweets from now till
Sunday count I guess this has been
creating problems for him actually
getting too many people sending nonsense
with with his at tag added also in other
very under anything to do with being on
probation he just as excited I get it
okay I get it I mean were you excited
when you were off probation
you didn't have to check in with your
officer anymore I don't think I you know
officially had well did your mom even
know about that she watches the show
doesn't she
oh yeah I know she I didn't tell her
about that sorry mom we'll talk about
that later I had other important news -
I forget what it was though I guess it
couldn't have been that important oh yes
brandon has brought the world's most
horrendous snack into this office oh he
brought so he pulls me over onto a set
to do like a and this is okay this is
not a sponsored bit no this stuff is
trash complete and absolute trash
nongshim you should never produce no now
get out of here
Rasch okay sorry I'm covering you out so
fresh no trash cover it up haha Oh rude
so he brings me over there to to do like
a like a bit Furby roll he's like look
relaxed look lazy so I'm sitting on the
couch it's Mike my bag of what is
presumably actually food on my on my
tummy I go and I grab one I throw it in
my mouth I'm just like but I swear just
about tossed it
these are disgusting okay so there's a
concept there's a concept that I call
here why don't you want you want you
grab a couple for throw in your mouth
will get your your dressing area okay
okay so there's a concept that I call I
actually learned this from my old boss
at NCIX I don't smell as bad as they
taste called calorie worthy hold on can
I have the back there's some nutritional
facts on these things so it's one thing
for something to have 20% of your daily
fat intake per 50 grams and there's
another thing altogether for it to taste
like absolute garbage at the same time
okay to be fair like they don't taste
great but they just don't taste like
anything or know how you had a strong
reaction you don't taste like I can look
like rotting ocean I got and your breath
is gonna be like I think I smell like
that Haitian Savage I'm not going to
have any more because I don't want to
scare people away from a block away but
like I can smell it really strongly now
that off yeah but like it tastes like
like really really really thin Airy rice
crispy or not rice crispy uh what are
those called it's made out of rice
crispy stuff I think like rice crackers
yeah yeah
so tastes like rice crackers with an
infusion of rotting shrimp yeah a little
bit absolutely disgust but it's not
super strong did you gag on it almost
almost gagged definitely had to spit it
out I didn't try to swallow it like I
didn't I didn't have that reaction oh I
cannot eat that trash that
horrible all right the smell the smell
the smell turns me off victim oh that is
not a good smell okay um this was
originally posted by kamesh SS on the
forum Intel is rumored to be working on
wait what but for mrs. so this is a non
tech form okay right Intel is rumored to
be working on core i9 processors so
let's go ahead and pull up this
exclusive post in the anon tech forum by
sweeper the Diamonds member and oh
whoops it helps if I plug in my laptop
dang it
No Go Diamond member do you have a
diamond members down card yeah rock hard
Diamond hard the hardest no there we go
okay that's better
um so this is the rumored skylake X
lineup Koro 979 20x whatever that means
karai 970 900 X so apparently all have a
nexus that's 12 cores and oh oh oh all
extreme it are they all like so
everything core I 9 is extreme setting
sense to you know you know what though
what I'll say is these specs actually
look like they make a fair bit of sense
I don't know about the names but 12 core
24 thread based on what we know about
skylake and its improved power profile
versus Broadwell that probably makes
sense for a new Extreme Edition and then
this generation they went okay two cores
down and otherwise mostly unaffected
with really good you know turbo speeds
or whatever so as a as a so we've got a
69 50 X and we've got a 69 hundred K
right now so these look like the
replacements there we got a 12 and a 10
core which is cool more cores I'm never
going to say no to that then moving down
this is where I don't like it but it
starts to make again a lot of sex core
that's an X though yeah so it looks like
they're changing it so that anything h
EDT high-end desktop so that's LGA is
1366
11 2011 3 and then I forget what this
one is going to be but it's the one
that's coming it looks like those are
all going to be X and all going to be
core I 9 now so these next two down
which will probably be like the the $700
and the like 500 450 $500 one look like
they're going to be eight and six core
with only 28 PCIe lanes and with the six
core really getting kicked in the teeth
as far as turbo boost goes so it's not
getting a job
go 3.0 this is all rumored though and
then this is a fairly weld substantiated
rumor that we're going to get a like a
KD Lake X on the high-end desktop
platform that and I don't get these
skews at all like at all but they're
basically going to be higher TDP core i7
7700 KS at 70 Core i5 7600 K that are
called 7740 that you have to have a much
more expensive motherboard in order to
install same PCIe lanes same size cache
4 cores 4 threads for the i5 or I guess
it's an i7 it's an i7 with no hyper
threading but I'm finally going to
measure it what I'm finally going to
have even notice that on the bottom one
I'm gonna have to redo that video now
and then for course 8 threads on the on
the ice on the actual i7 that's that
yeah I don't get this so I don't know if
you remember this but back when Intel
split the lineups
so LGA 775 was the last time we had
Extreme Edition all the way down to
Celeron on the same socket yeah then
what happened was Intel launched LGA
1156 so that was Linfield and what
happened with the LGA 1156 was that all
of a sudden we got this
wait hold on let me think for a second
was in 1156 first or did they launch
1366 first oh I might be getting myself
into trouble here sorry what's that
it was 1366 first and then what happened
was they launched 1156 and then they we
said we got Linfield and then we got
what what was it Ivy Bridge after
Linfield no Sandy Bridge Sandy Bridge
was the first one who switched on the
Sandy Bridge switched it up right and
Sandy Bridge was on the same platform as
Linfield ah dang it I'm getting my Intel
history mixed up you know what why don't
you do another topic well I double-check
this stuff okay and then we'll we'll get
back to I'm pretty sure everything John
de Soto's right though I am I am too but
I also just want to I couldn't really
hear them very well anyway and if I just
put it in front of me and then I will
feel better sure a lot of these are like
either big topic yeah okay very Nvidia
releases GeForce experience 3.6 that's
news apparently posted by the dark
potato shadow play now supports
additional rendering API is including
OpenGL and Vulcan and the usability has
been streamlined apparently allowing
easy uploads to Facebook if you wanted
to do that twitch and Google from an
improved
overlay but probably still is taking
telemetry data to a certain degree and
still requires a full login to use so I
will still continue to not have it on
any of my computers so it's not going to
help me at all okay okay here we go
yeah so L so LGA 1366 here we go so we
had 775 everything was unified we got
LGA 1113 66 which was this bonafide
higher end platform it had triple
channel memory it had more PCIe Lane my
dad still runs it at some point later on
it ended up getting up to six core
processors which was pretty
earn dope AF as the kids say
in fact the core i7 980 X I believe it
was called here we go
that one launched q1 2010 so I believe
that came out right with the platform
launch as I recall anyway so bonafide
higher end platform then we got
Clarkdale and Lynnfield on LGA 1156 then
what Intel did was they gave us the
consumer upgrade to that which was Sandy
Bridge first before giving us sandy
bridge-e on LGA 2011 if I recall
correctly again oh wow I really hope I'm
not making another mistake did we get
sandy bridge-e on 1366 this is terrible
this is the worst when show segments
that I have ever done I have very to
care about these ever done no time well
it was my job to sell it so so it
definitely yeah so we got time we got in
a hail um and then did it that it did it
- that is it wow this is this is
incredibly unhelpful Microsoft unveiled
a Windows mixed reality controller thing
Microsoft has announced controllers to
support new mixed reality and VR
headsets coming from the likes of Acer
and HP the controllers will rely on
inside-out tracking technology so you
won't need to setup any special sensors
around your room in order to actually
use them they have a thumb stick like
the oculus touch a touchpad like the
Vives and a1 like design with a tracking
ring on the end
I don't think gonna be able to get this
on stream Acer will offer them bundled
together with its Windows VR headset for
a $100 premium ya know I do I have you
oh I see give me a second
yes we got this there
so they look kind of like a hybrid
almost I'm sting okay they sort of look
like someone was like hey were the new
players maybe if we just wedge ourselves
exactly in between we'll see if we can
do okay because they look they look like
vibe controllers that someone tried to
like wrench and octaves controller on -
yeah if they're light they could be
pretty comfortable they gotta get the
weighting right and it's hard to say
like if the base of the handle would had
kind of some heft to it like if that's
where the battery is yeah and I could I
could kind of see this I could kind of
see this being okay okay so anyway yes
um go back for one quick second oh yes
and here's pictured the Acer VR headband
oh so I've talked to Acer about this
right now dev kits only they are not
seating them to press but we are
definitely interested in getting our
hands on one of these can check out at
the Acer event that I was at in New York
Microsoft like head AR guy came on and
was talking about how this headset is
apparently actually pretty fantastic
yeah so I don't know I mean it's a
keynote so like who knows yeah it could
be nonsense but there you go there's
someone somewhat credible who came
instead of thing that might be
believable yeah um okay okay okay so yes
I was right so sandy bridge-e went on to
socket 2011 and that happened after we
had gotten Sandy Bridge architecture on
the mainstream platform anyway the whole
point of all of that was the rumor the
word on the street was that for LGA 1366
it was rumoured that in addition to the
core i7 9:20 9:30 and oh I don't want to
get this wrong I don't remember if the
950 came later whatever whatever the
launch lineup was they were all core i7
the
rumour was that there was going to be a
higher end core i9 okay and that never
did materialize we did get extreme
edition dual socket platforms but Intel
never formally called those core i9
those ended up with names like I think
was core i7 97 75 was the end of QX no
QX 97 75 was the end of actually that
was on LGA 771 so what was what was what
was the one after after Skull trail I
think it was just window trying to find
a new gap so after that so you were
basically just expected to put Zeon's in
them as I recall correctly so EVGA SR 2
so they had the classified SR 2 it was
dual 1366 but people basically just put
Zeon's in them so there you go that's
what that's what went down there um
so finally core I 9 is raising its head
again and maybe we will see a core I 9
but maybe not I've also seen other
rumors that have suggested that it's
just going to be more core i7 but I
think that would man that the lineup is
getting so confusing here yes if there's
any truth to this rumor whatsoever it's
gonna be like what is a core i5 you know
what though there's another way to look
into this uh-huh this is very good for
us this is fantastic for us it is
terrible for like almost everyone else
but like us and Paul and Khalid Demetri
and other like tech YouTube people
fantastic written article people great
so everybody wins xx that for all of the
consumers okay well I guess I'm okay
with that because we're gonna have to
make videos explaining what the hell is
going on is probably going to be a tech
rookie video explaining what the heck
and i9 is I'm gonna have everything I'm
gonna have to completely redo that video
jon is going to have to completely redo
that video a big explanation of
the technical overview of these
processors when it comes out is going to
have to be like okay what the heck even
is this you can check out the tech
rookie video but here's a short
explanation Bill Dubois alright let's
get into we actually don't always talk
about you know the security exploit du
jour on the land show just because you
know there are other publications that I
think handle that kind of security stuff
a little bit more in depth than we don't
with than we do yeah we're not going to
dive into it but this posted originally
on the forum by master disaster the
original article here is from ARS
technica is sort of a big deal okay
jappa knowledge bomb Luke here we go so
there's a bunch of different things
going on with this I actually don't know
enough about it to be completely on it
but if you want like springboard points
wanna crypt or it was spotted a few
weeks ago the ransomware was not really
distributed that much and then suddenly
wanna crypt door exploded and began
spreading like wildfire through an
export called eternal blue one thing
that's freaky with all this kind of
stuff is a lot of it's derived from NSA
tech and it's ransomware so big
companies are getting hit their servers
getting locks down encrypted and the key
is being sold to them for I believe it's
like three hundred dollars but then who
the heck knows if that even works
yep that's like the core concept of the
whole issue and it's being distributed
like a worm
so it's spreading extremely fast hitting
a ton I think it's one you saying he'll
learn more countries for the viewers who
don't know that's a really kind of a big
topic okay that's why I mean thirty
second sort of a worm versus like
opening an attachment on your computer
it's going to try to grow itself and
it's going to try to travel around and
expand by itself it's not it's not like
a targeted attack they're not going we
want Linus tech tips servers I'm going
to try to hit this dude with it
why are letting it try to crawl around
on its own got it
so organizations in at least 74
countries have been affected with Russia
being disproportionately affected
followed by Ukraine India and Taiwan it
is spreading at a rate of about a
hundred IPs
per minute now there is an insane amount
of IPS out there but that is really fast
they're demanding like I said about 300
to 600 dollars paid in Bitcoin
unsurprisingly by May 15th or if you
miss that deadline they're all
apparently be a higher fee by May 19th
and the message is left on the screen
say files will remain encrypted it's not
clear if there are flaws in the
encryption scheme that might allow the
victims to restore the files without
paying the ransom little unlikely I'd
say according to an article posted by
Madrid based El Mundo 85% of computers
at telefónica Spain's dominant telecom
are affected by the worm although that
has not been confirmed rua Wow
so basically um I set up snapshotting
yesterday I hadn't gotten around to it
yet on the vault yeah um so that's a
thing so actually I guess this leads us
to a pretty good discussion I guess
around how to protect yourself against
ransomware yeah so one of the ways we
just dos the pathway is what what a shot
snapshot is good but you it would be
very helpful if you saved snapshots on a
service that wasn't always connected
there because it's a worm so it could
just potentially encrypt both of them
then you have two ransomware machines um
okay so the way okay so okay okay okay
so let's back up a little bit
snapshotting what it does is without
without creating a completely separate
copy like snapshotting a 70 let's see
how big is the vault right now 160
terabytes is how much data we're
actually using right now snapshotting a
160 terabyte share
by duplicating it would be super dumb
yeah
like using up 320 terabytes of space do
you want to have another copy would be
bad yeah but that's not how it works the
way it works is it actually only logs
changes so you have the original one and
then you have logged changes after that
that's right so let's say I deleted a
one terabyte folder from my 160
terabytes that means then ok apparently
the National Health Service was affected
and lots of data has been lost Wow lots
of patient data Wow ok ok so back to
back to how to protect yourself okay so
what snapshotting does is let's say I
deleted what a one terabyte folder from
my 160 until I reach the end of how long
I want to keep my snapshots so you set
up a profile like say for example you
snapshot every hour for 24 hours and
then every day for 7 days and every week
for 4 weeks that would be a pretty
typical sort of load out and then every
month for 12 months people might do
something along those lines so until
that terabyte folder that I deleted
reaches the end of all of my retention
sort of setup that reaches all the ha1
big thing to pay attention to here is if
your snapshotting everything yes you
want to make sure that whatever you're
putting it on I was going to explain
that but my brain is dumb ok ok ok ok so
total space on disk if you don't get to
get rid of stuff you've deleted until
after it's like falling off the end of
how long you retain your snapshots there
that's what I was going for well I did
send clearly unqualified Thursday so
basically the way that it works on our
servers is that the snapshotting is done
on the ZFS pool level and then the way
that the data is actually visible over
our network is through a Samba share so
we are snapshotting the pool so the
snapshots themselves are never actually
visit
of all - anything that is connected to
our server via the network so that's one
way that you can be couple your
snapshotting solution from computers on
the network that because it's a worm and
it spreads over the network could
otherwise infect it and encrypt it
because if you think that you're keeping
your data safe just by having it on an
as that is not the case at all something
that gets actually not right now
something that gets on to your computer
if that computer and that user that's
logged in on your computer has write
access to that share it can do whatever
it wants to it including encrypting the
data that I get there eventually I think
so and one of the mods in the forum
thank you very much I'm not going to say
your name because it's like actually
your full name on here and I don't know
if that's okay or not
has said that depending on how your
snapshots are set up it may be useless
against something like this worm because
it is designed to delete windows file
history backups shadow volume copies etc
so it's it's a little little aggressive
if you want to be like SuperDuper sure
one of the things that you could do is
back up onto a device like an external
hard drive or something gotta just
unplug it yep the easiest way to defend
against something that is spreading over
a network is to not be on the network
there you go so I'm parent if we want to
keep on diving into this I can go
through like the point-to-point of how
it works yeah I would actually love to
hear about that this is actually in our
notes but the the installer creates an
encrypted zip with all of the malware
files the now our files are extracted
with ransom notes in all popular
languages wanna crypt or will then
download a tor client tor is used to
communicate with ransomware servers at
dot Onion addresses it gives everyone
permissions to all files and folders all
database and mail server processes are
stopped as data used by these will be
encrypted to all files are encrypted
when encrypted the dot WN cry extension
is added it stores the following in
every folder that
ass please read me at txt ransom note at
wanna crypto at exe decrypter it
requests admin privileges from the user
with UAC prompts to do the following
clear the shadow volume copies disabled
windows startup recovery and clear
Windows Server backup history the
computer background is changed and
wanted decrypter 2.0 launches with the
ransom note in your local language well
that's convenient actually rather
sophisticated wow it's a little
aggressive
so like if you like store your super
important might get audited tax
information or something unlike an ass
that's like USB plugged into your
computer so maybe unplug it or something
an encrypted file container could sit
there and you might think that that's
safe but this could actually take your
encrypted file container and encrypt
that and encrypt that yeah there's a lot
of layers of encryption just you started
mentioning things like tax returns and I
know like I'm I was I was actually like
I'm just I'm thinking about it from a
not linus Media Group perspective I was
like okay hold on a second where's that
container that contains all of linus
media groups that stuff right yeah
that's not that's not safe unless it's
on so so the way that i set up is okay
though right
i think so yeah okay we can go over to
after more and I'm pretty sure I'm
pretty sure um
yeah has changed since I've been like
integral to the server stuff right so I
don't know but we can go alright and
Vidya this was posted by Doc swag on the
forum the original article here we have
is from PC world.com and vidya announces
a Volta GPU I did not see this one
coming I didn't think both of was coming
for a bit actually so for those of you
who aren't aware this is the update to
Nvidia a lot of gal architecture a lot
of people are saying like oh this is
already patched in March a lot of people
running servers don't automatically
download every patch that comes out and
there updates disabled which is why it's
sort of a big deal that's like a super
big deal and that's why people are very
widely talking about companies that are
getting affected a lot of companies that
be running servers that don't have
Windows Update enabled or they might
have they might have a domain controller
that has a policy that you know tells
they had the entire fleet of deployed
laptops not to install updates except
when they decide to roll them out like
there's a lot of there's a lot more to
the world than just like the way that an
individual uses a computer every single
person having Windows Update on
automatic is not a reality that we exist
I mean that's what we do but not not no
servers all servers no but I like ok
yeah I'm also a big stupid nerd though
and I'm like often in the server room at
the end of the day and when no one else
is here I'll be like oh good no one else
is here and I'll like install updates
and reboot the servers so ours are
probably actually fine I've done them
pretty recently yeah but like there is a
lot of people that might not have that
update is what I'm trying to get across
I just you know I do kind of wish that
Microsoft would make it clear when it's
actually that important instead of like
trying to force you to update the
Windows 10 with that said you know what
our Active Directory domain server did
completely restart on its own and that
was about three weeks ago I think so I'm
actually kind of wondering three four
weeks ago I'm wondering if that was an
update getting rolled out and exactly
like if that was the like hey you
actually really need to do this stage
and it just didn't because I tried to
log into it and it was it was hung on
the like Windows is restarting please
don't turn off your computer I'm saying
you're going really really all right
back to volta so this is in videos
update to the Pascal architecture but if
you are wondering what relevance this
has to your gaming experience in the
immediate future the answer is very
little
none at all this thing is an absolute
monster this could be it's not the
biggest it is one of the biggest pieces
of silicon ever made it has a ridiculous
look at that yeah.he this article even
called it ridiculous ridiculous 815
millimeter squared die to put that in
perspective the biggest GPUs we've ever
seen we actually just finished and
NVIDIA GPUs through the ages bit the
biggest ones we've ever seen things like
r9 290x from AMD so our 600 I'm trying
to remember which ones from Nvidia that
have crept up near that 600 millimeter
squared size actually the outgoing P 100
was around 600 plus millimeter squared
this is like 30% bigger then it's it's
like it's like it's like building it's
like the canyon arrow of GPUs and I
guess that reference is a little bit
dated now but it's it's like 30% bigger
than any other plane that flew that day
unbelievable it's using HP m2 memory and
it has over 5,000 CUDA cores with 21
billion transistors this thing is unreal
so this will be this will be the GPU
that's the heart of the Tesla V 100
which is like man I was so bummed
because I went earlier this week I went
down to Simon Fraser University to do an
unboxing of their new supercomputer
it hasn't been formally benchmarked yet
actually like they're so very much
installing it the the storage servers
haven't been spun up yet like it's
woeful it's in progress so I went down
to to get hands-on with it and pretty
much as I was sliding out a shelf
of P 100's and I was like nerding out
over it I got a notification on my phone
that Nvidia drop the V 100 sounds like
this is how it feels to be a computer
and that's pretty rude I literally just
touched this for the first time to talk
to Lee so not only is this a huge die
but it's actually using a new process
technology as well so instead of being
16 nanometer this one is 14 nanometer as
I recall 12 nanometer in his 12
nanometer what the balls and I think
Pascal is yeah Pascal was 14 nanometer
sorry so I had I was off by 2 they're
freaking crazy
apparently the R&amp;amp;D budget was over 3
billion dollars so if you had some hope
that Vega was going to show up and take
the wind out of Nvidia sales why okay I
don't know how many people are gonna be
buying for y100
no but this like in terms of calculators
a three billion dollar R&amp;amp;D budget goes
into the our venture yeah that gets you
the architecture that NVIDIA has
demonstrated they've been very good at
scaling up and scaling down for more and
less performance and power consumption
so AMD already had no answer to Pascal
yeah
poor MD and if you imagine for a moment
that AMD had three billion dollars to
blow on Vega you've got another thing
coming
I did yeah I'm holding out hope I
believe they have negative three billion
dollars too long Vega I I hope that Andy
can do something you know crazy here and
and just kind of blindside everybody but
this is this is a real shot across the
bow not even giving AMD a chance to show
off Vegas performance before they're
like yep we have like working Hardware
here it is we're ready to rock holy crap
alright then um sponsors sure yeah we
got some sponsors for the show today
this episode is brought to you by
Squarespace Squarespace is the way to
build your own beautiful website whether
it's a you know all about nuts and you
just want to tell everybody everything
you know whether you're running the you
know the local peewee soccer team
football football sorry if I say
football in any way people can interpret
that word to me okay local football team
and you just want people to be able to
find out your your game schedule and how
do you know how to join the team or
whatever it is you want to build a
website you want it to look Pro even if
you don't know jack squat all about
building a website Squarespace is the
way to do it with seriously in like a
few hours you can go from zero to
picking out a template even like writing
from scratch all the copy you want for
your page putting in all of your images
and having it makes it much more like
making a really cool document it's sort
of like me need to know how to code and
all kind of exactly yeah so you can go
in just a few hours from only knowing
like photos and text to having a working
website that's rock-solid stable and
looks great on any device because all of
their templates use responsive design I
mean what am what else can i really say
about it I like that they have commerce
modules yeah like if you do want to sell
stuff through your site maybe maybe
maybe you know how to code and you can
make your own website but you don't
really want to manage this other website
but like maybe your mom is making small
trinkets and doesn't want to use Etsy or
whatever and wants to have our own
little store you could set her up with
Squarespace so that you don't have to
manage it you know it'll always work
with all the browser's all the time
would you hypothetically do that yes yes
this is this maybe happen
um so head over to Squarespace calm
/when and use offer code when to save
10% you know what actually speaking of
which my brother breeds aquatic lizards
and stuff
actually I didn't I don't know what I'm
talking about yes that knots been like a
passion for him and I actually my my
contribution to his entrepreneurial
spirit and action I have officially
actually paid for Squarespace now oh I
bought him a year of Squarespace there
you go
it was that's a good like here push
start your business yeah I just like
like it I mean to be clear it's not free
like it does cost money but compared to
the time that's involved in trying to
set up something scratch-built or even
something that's a kit but more
complicated it's been totally hands-off
even though my brother's not super techy
I was just like here here's your login
account drag-and-drop move things around
and he's stoked on it that's alright
just helping improve discoverability for
your business I can't believe I've never
told that anecdote before not like
Christmastime yeah weird that's cool
anyway speaking of your small business
if you're looking for an accounting so
why haven't I up them up with fresh
books yet haha you went 50 percent of
the way okay did you have a birthday
coming up this Christmas right you know
what August there you go yeah why don't
I just put my brother up with fresh
books for his birthday
okay so fresh books is the super simple
way to handle the backend of managing
your business so logging hours tracking
expenses sending out invoices to people
you can send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds I think
that's the 30
second one hour less than the day
whatever it's really fast their app has
a feature that lets you see when your
clients look at the invoice for the
first time one of my favorite things and
will probably be helpful for your
brother is that if you get receipts or
something because you buy like say yeah
aquatic lizard food you can take a
picture of it with your phone and it
will automatically take care of all your
expenses yeah it's actually it's pretty
it's pretty lit for a quadric lizard
tanks the mobile app has all the
functionality of the desktop version so
you can take it with you on the go and
if you have any questions you can reach
out to their support staff where you
will speak to a real human immediately
no phone tree no escalations no return
call it's really funny because this
tagline sounds so bad there is no phone
trees no escalations no return calls and
then they're like just answers oh oh so
it's good it's in a good way so head to
FreshBooks comm slash when and try it
out for free today enter when and how
did you hear about us section when you
sign up for your free trial and all I
can forget to mention they've got a
mobile card reader as well so you can
even accept payments directly through
the platform I have one more ad
technically but this is more of like us
just talking about our thing wow that
banner looks terrible yeah rudos that is
the worst looking banner that we have
ever made it's looking it looks awful
what happened to it I mean I think they
just took the logo and just put it on
the gray background and then never
looked at it and we're just like cool
it's done I bet tell us to blame for
this because he he did a lot of the work
on the logo way to go way to go Pella
anyways anyway we're having a tech
conneautville yes is like a weird
mixture between Khan and carnival some
of the ideas that that is like it's
going to be tech based and we're all
going to be there there will be cool fun
activities but there will also be like a
nerf shooting range maybe maybe you know
the activities are very much up in the
air I don't know if you're see seed on
the emails but depending on how many
people sign up what the event actually
is might change Oh
but the whole team will be there and
will be it'll be cool and they'll be fun
okay and there'll be stuff to do and you
basically hang out with us for a day
yeah and if that sounds appealing to you
then great head over to ticket Rocket
dotco slash event slash details holy
crap this is a horrible URL I'm Jordan
that I'm going to go ahead and drop that
in the thing here and if it sounds
horrible then don't come a few people
from my stream have bought tickets from
your stream people from your stream are
they born yet ha ha it's not really a
stream so much as a and in fairness I
didn't tell them don't come yeah I'm
good
I'm always done the know well with me um
anyways Wow uh yeah so that would be
cool I haven't actually met a ton of
them at different like conventions of
stuff but that might have been the worst
bid I ever did that was pretty those
those pretty heavy yeah yeah um all
right
Harvick's let's get in just let's get
back to the back just get back into it
yeah okay so some are a big news
Andy is pushing another microcode update
to improve Rison so the original article
here is from tweak downs go ahead and
pop that up here basically improved ddr4
support which is good because they don't
support ddr3 at all so if they can't
improve the DD of course important them
we're in a lot of trouble the info was
leaked by a gigabyte reps forum post
indicating AMD is pushing out the
microcode update it will add over 20 new
registers for the summit ridge
integrated memory controllers to improve
compatibility with Intel optimized ddr4
memory brands it will be deployed to
your motherboard vendors as motherboard
BIOS updates this is crazy this is
supposed to buy random HK kid on the
forum and the original article is from
the BBC UK police to start using mine or
30 report esque means to help with
custody decisions what what it has been
tested for 3 years and is now being
readied for a live pilot apparently it's
98% I can't even fight on here but I
remember it's 98% accurate with low-risk
offenders
yeah with low with a suspect of low risk
it was accurate 98% of the time and for
tasks for high-risk suspects were
accurate 88% of the time so basically
it's designed to classify individuals
based on a low medium or high risk of
them committing a future offense and
then to decide whether they should be
kept in custody the system was made so
using data so the tool is called the
harm assessment risk tool or Hart and
the data was taken from Durham police
records between 2008 and 2012 it was
then tested in 2013 and the results were
monitored over the following two years
so forecasts Wow so that's so basically
those numbers are based on real
forecasts that they made over the last
half a decade or so I'm actually almost
a decade
isn't that incredible I'd like to know
what they were using for forecasting in
this data well they're using whether
they caught them doing something again
no like because they're guessing if
they're going to be doing something or
not so how are they guessing that ah
let's have a look okay yeah I think it's
Wow here we go so the system includes
data beyond but also including a
suspects offending history including
their postal code and gender to some
extent what learning models do is bring
out into the foreground hidden and tacit
assumptions that have been made all
along by human beings so pretty much
they're using machine learning to
stereotype accurately yeah
ah like we would I think the giant
conversation and like four or five years
is going to be bad yeah it's like how
much is this becoming a self-fulfilling
prophecy yeah it's like and I don't I'm
not I'm not going to I don't want this
to become like one of those things where
I where I fell into the trap where I
said I'm not going to say that someone
whose name starts with H anything very
poorly I'm not gonna I'm I'm not going
to do that again so we're yeah but like
what I do what I really saying like you
know skin colors and genders and you
know backgrounds and jobs basically
we're going to be making these arguments
five years from now that this system is
creating this self-fulfilling prophecy
of suspicion that that goes beyond sort
of the you're racist grandpa or whatever
we're like the computer thinks I can't
do this right yes which is the system
objectively empirically has decided that
I am a high risk individual to be a
criminal and then like does this start
becoming public data can that be seen on
employment records like if you're going
to hire someone can you see the risk
profile that would stop anyone from
having the chance of being able to rise
above yes which is like really brutal
that's terrifying I'm super not cool
with that now to be clear not all the
decisions that it is helping or that is
helping with seem like that big of a
deal like one of the things is to decide
whether to keep a suspect in custody for
a few more hours whether to really lease
them on bail before a charge or after a
charge has been made whether to
reprimand them in custody now that one
doesn't sound very good but about the
preview or a few more hours or yeah
that's probably fine huh he's like
saving a little bit of someone's time
instead of like so the forecasting
models output is advisory yeah
and should not remove discretion from
the police officer using a bit coming up
if the police officers job on easy
because of this yeah edifying music and
and it becomes an ass covering measure
yeah well it told me yeah if I'm a cop
I'm you know if I know that even eighty
eight percent of the time I'm going to
get it right if I just do what the
computer tells me I'm like it might it
might come to the point where like yeah
it's advisory but if you go against the
advisory well you might against the
advice that will raise a flag and you
don't have to go talk to your boss
that's right why you went against the
best advice that you could you created
extra paperwork and headache for
yourself your boss is gonna be pissed
off because why do I have to have this
stupid meaning you could you should have
just gone with the computer whatever Wow
terrifying um oh cool Microsoft confirms
keyboard for Xbox one for sure and also
some mice and in the future they plan on
having all mice working now it's going
to have to be supported by developers so
rip everyone but as we already know
there's a lot of like emulation stuff
that can happen now console gamers can
put up with crappy console port UI ma
nonsense yeah that's great
like the grand theft auto options for
changing your graphical settings that
are just broken a yes for no reason
oh yeah I loaded it again with a minor
hardware change time for those to be all
related press a to continue you're like
[Laughter]
what is the word Oh answer all you mean
enter or sometimes spacebar yeah as it
works uh that's still pretty cool I love
that they are finally getting this like
convergence thing going why did why did
we treat the Xbox one like not a
computer for so long hung like
absolutely as a computer it makes it's
so frustrating
so it says initially most models of mice
won't be compatible however a handful of
mice will be and Microsoft hopes to add
support for all mice over time but even
then developers lost a code support for
this new control system into their games
that could be easy for games that are
already developed for Windows with uwp
porting in mind but it might be a bigger
lift for
or more control centric delivered
developers certain games that are
multiplayer I'm so stoked on that yeah
it's going to be really interesting
because for a while we've had like these
weird
we had one in office for a little while
and it was just so Genki and broken and
we decided not to do a video on it yeah
but it was they were like so butthurt
over that they were emailing me for like
six months after won't make a better
product when is the review going up one
of the review going up and remember me
following up with you'd be like hey
when's that review going up and you're
just like eventually just like never I
don't remember what company it was from
but we had this little box we could plug
a keyboard a mouse into an Xbox and it
was just it was just kind of garbage so
we never made a video on it but now that
it has like official support it could be
really good yeah in videos new
headquarters will be liquid-cooled with
a triple fan solution the original
article here is game debate calm and it
actually looks yeah I think it looks
kind of dumb but it's a big triangle
made up of like tessellated triangles
and it's going to have two floors and
capacity for up to 2500 employees there
will be a large central courtyard which
every department feeds into and this is
an effort to quote-unquote
capture the energy and buzz of the
company ray okay so that's neat Jensen
does not have an office here another
weird ran a bit of information he does
not have an office in the big new
headquarters really yep so he's just
gonna like walk around and check on
people I or like be somewhere else I
don't know interesting oh yeah I'm sure
there's no offices under the floor
there's a giant garage and the building
has a snaking system of pipes that feed
into a hidden water tower sunk into the
roof of the building the recycled water
is then filtered through an evaporation
system utilizing three giant fans to
keep the building cool so that's that is
that is pretty cool actually SSU
supercomputer is using evaporative
cooling
well oh cool yeah and it the way that
they did it is really neat I want to
know now you would imagine evaporative
cooling so on the most basic level
evaporative cooling would be you've got
cooling tubes you've exposed the water
to air flow so that it some of the water
molecules evaporate and you effectively
cool down the remaining droplets to sub
ambient temperatures and then that gets
circulated but the problem with an open
system is that you long term you get
contaminants in it so at all right and
the other thing you would probably
assume is that the water being pumped
around the data center goes to the heat
generating components like say for
example CPUs and GPUs and then there's a
hot side that carries that water back
out to be cooled so two things that are
going to blow your mind
there's the water cooling system for the
building but there are no blocks
installed on anything and they're using
evaporative cooling but the actual
coolant being recirculated is not
exposed to the elements former so the
radiators outside the building there's
an automated system that when the
coolant temperature goes above a certain
threshold they basically have a big fire
hose Wow that sprays them down and I was
like that is so cool so they can
maintain their 17 degree coolant target
in up to 30 degree weather Wow
yes what and then they have they have an
extra chiller that can kick in I'm going
to get like up really high and and you
know boost the now now back to the
server's they're all air cool how are
they doing so they're ambien both
evaporative cooling so by spraying water
on the fins it cools the fins wow that's
so magical so it's not going to be just
sometimes they're going to spray it yeah
early often yes okay yeah and they were
saying that in hot I thought you were
just saying like in particularly know it
would spray so in high temperature low
humidity
the water evaporates nearly instantly so
they can just keep blasting it it gets
super cold well that's why really neat
and then in the server's get this they
are drawing in air from the room versus
from the room and they're just air
cooled servers so they've got ducting so
there is all taped up and sealed up
every cabinet so all the air goes in one
way there's no there's there's no kind
of like in efficiency from our back
pressure forcing air to be recirculated
within the cabinet and then what they've
got is massive radiators on the back of
every rack that are so thick and so
dense that when you scan so if you open
up the door and stand behind it it feels
like a server rack it's like freaking
hot like 30 degrees Celsius you close
the door and it's like a cool breeze oh
it's incredible it's amazing oh and it's
super efficient cool
so a typical data center I forget what
the video is called cuz you're making
your video on this right oh it's already
yeah this is in production already I
filmed yep cool it's it's lit it's
amazing um so a typical data center in a
perfect I forget what those the scale is
you think it's lit now yeah I know in a
personal world you in a perfect world
the scale is one would be like ideal you
can never achieve that yeah a3 fishin
see ya on whatever the scale is yeah
typical data center is one and a half to
two there at 1.07 because their cooling
system is so efficient because pumping a
little bit of water especially in rain
Coover yeah yeah yeah no not a real
hydro up here like doesn't matter yeah I
like you like I think I get a water bill
but I don't know how much it costs
because it's not a big deal and like
even power because our powers like
water-based
yeah like BC is one of the worst places
for solar power I'm like so interested
in solar power but it's so useless for
me because power is relatively cheap and
we have an extremely low amount of like
natural sunlight because we have so many
clouds
there's like other places in Canada that
are way more effective for solar power
than PC is okay did you talk about this
before okay cool this is old news but
I'm mad so we're going to talk about it
anyway Intel Reber
do Intel rebrand there's the online
announces new chips based on skylake so
the original article here's from extreme
tech we've gone is Xeon e3 e5 etc here
is platinum gold silver and bronze
because apparently Intel's naming scheme
folks while they the old system was near
indecipherable at least it had like some
years of continuity so it was somewhat
easy to keep track of what was going on
generation by generation now they don't
want us to be able to understand what's
going on and they also completely lack
creativity unbelievable I don't really
have any redeeming stuff for that I
think you found another tech cookie
video to make oh yeah technology like
half the videos on tech wiki should just
be explaining naming schemes yeah and
then we should just encourage more
companies to have really long co naming
schemes because like what I don't like
about this is in a lot of situations
maybe a silver is exactly what you want
and having a platinum one might
literally be worse
yeah because we've definitely run into
that yeah so it's not absolutely like oh
it's just it's actually better if it's
in a higher tier and it'll cost more
that's not actually true this is
fantastic this was originally posted by
n Tony on the forum and open bench table
seemingly as a direct response to us
dropping our test benches now has a 3d
printable vertical stand I was wondering
why they sent this to me because the guy
emailed me directly being like hey by
the way there
now 3d printable stands and I was like
ok ha ha ha and that actually makes a
lotta sense that oh man yeah we should
probably put some of this yeah I guess
that's pretty much in is there anything
else you really wanted to hit today uh
full plane uh worse oh oh yeah ok so
people have been hounding us when is
scrapyard wars actually coming because
the the the the teaser just said may
soonish because II D is a gigantic troll
yeah scrapyard wars does have a firm
release date the first episode is coming
to floatplane club this weekend have a
like a night specifically uh it's I
don't yet we do but I don't remember
what a dinner yet Yvonne was actually
like stoked she was like hey do you want
to watch scrapyard wars with me tonight
and I was like yeah that's the trailer
she's like what no wait what well when's
it coming I wanna watch it yeah watch it
for real Oh spoiler weather was like
what is it being uploaded so it is first
episode coming this weekend to
floatplane so the following weekend to
YouTube so there will be episodes will
be coming one week apart we've we've got
the production process streamlined
enough now that we can we can commit to
that and then there will be a one-week
delay between floatplane Club and
YouTube so if you guys are wondering how
to be the first to get your hands on
scrapyard Wars basically what you do is
you head over to the store on the Linus
tech tips forum there will be a better
system for this in the future I promise
you know but you head over to the store
and you buy a subscription to floatplane
Club which gives you access don't worry
I know I got this which gives you access
- hold on no no it's it's fine I think
we're good now actually we're going
supposed to be using a lapped
I I prime L the admin team on the for I
know I know but I'm I they were trying
to take your admin account away okay
about that it was like put to a vote in
you boss okay I like tried to veto it
because I said you would use a different
laptop and then you told me that you I
will get it died well I'm not today but
you can see how aware of it okay
approval to share my screen sure okay
finances screen don't click on anything
I'm not clicking on anything I'm not
clicking on anything so you will get
access to a hidden sub forum on the
forum there's a button up here to go to
it floatplane club and then you'll see
all the stuff that is out on
slow-playing but isn't out yet on
YouTube so we've got the world's
smallest video drone we've got channel
super fun I think on YouTube we're going
to call this video this game was banned
yeah we have to because it was yeah we
have best desktop graphics for your
laptop so we take a proprietary solution
versus Thunderbolt over E and benchmark
the snot out of it that's really an
affectionate little video we've got
removing thermal compound the best way
we test I think it's over over a dozen
different liquids I drank some of them
yeah we were done LTP is bigger worse
the Alienware 15 gaming laptop review ah
this one was a simultaneous release
we've got the most bizarre keyboard that
one's going to be fine there's also like
little bits that you're doing from every
now I don't do that very often though
that's like the post but theoretically
there's some more sort of discussion in
there yeah so there you go this is the
one that went up on what that went up on
YouTube just do it hello in a couple
days sky 4 doors will be there yes it
will just so exciting I know I'm so
interested in what happened do you know
how many episodes there are you want to
talk ok I believe held on you know what
I don't want to say something wrong so
do you want to talk about some of the
beefing up that you've done the beauty
in
and that's all you don't like okay nope
got it all oh I might make it might make
a post on the floatplane subform but I
don't want to talk about it hopefully
everything will be fine
even people let me let me give me one
second I have an idea
nope nope not going to work seven
okay hold on hold on a minute beam seven
episodes because the feedback people
told me was too long really how long
were episodes before 25 minutes 45
minutes I could have told you that what
I won't really know 45 minutes
what what what what hold on seven
episodes for the season hate you are
they are they a totally 45 minutes 45
minute episode went along the last ones
were I don't remember he keeps creeping
up the runtime he's going to be doing
three hour episodes but he's just going
to start releasing the whole thing uncut
at some point and see if I notice she's
gonna be like yeah you know what it was
easier this way okay okay okay so four
episodes 45 minutes each coming over the
next month I'm going to drop that link
in the chat again because you guys
should really get signed up for flow
plane club
it actually is pretty awesome i I mean
do you want to talk about any of the
cool stuff you're doing not really ah
you're such a killjoy right now
hell I test it more the thing with
Oakland Club is if it works really well
most people won't notice and that's like
the point yeah I guess but that's like
yep that's fine just just keep me posted
and everything will be fine
oh okay hold on I just want to can we
try a live demo again yeah okay because
I think last time we tried one Italy
like that's what I like that I just
don't want to okay yeah I'll make a post
about more stuff and I'll I'll figure
out things that I want to talk about I
just I don't really like talking about
things a ton before they've matured a
little bit and I'm like sure that there
fine alright alright and like if
something fails with it or something
weird I don't want people to do it water
it alright okay so let's have a look at
the world's smallest video drone video
here yes the cancerous thumbnails are
still there a lot of the time look at
that did you see that play okay but hold
on hold on cuz we're going easy on it
ammonia
okay so 1080p Wow look at that look at
that preview look at how fast that loads
in baby
oh yeah yeah it wasn't too bad look at
that performance hey do you remember
when YouTube buffered so that you could
skip ahead like nearly instantly like
that do you remember the good old days
that's how every video player should
work I think anyway the point is to
those wandering floatplane is working we
are we are it is more successful by the
week which is one of the reasons that
we've been talking about it more on when
show there have been sort of less and
less issues yeah week by week so yeah we
definitely recommend joining if you want
the scrapyard wars experience I'm very
exciting things happened in the lad I
don't necessarily want to talk about
them yet maybe next week we'll see how
well it goes and we'll see how much more
like buffing up of it we do here because
there might be more expansion that we do
with it and make cetera et cetera cetera
but some really exciting things have
happened recently that I thought we're
going to take like months to do because
boilers a genius and things went really
well contrary to the haters did we get
enough good applicants that you feel
pretty good about our chances of yeah so
we actually have a lot of really good
applicants the coding challenge is
finishing up this Sunday at midnight and
some people have already started
submitting their projects I don't know
why because they have the whole weekend
but I guess they're busy over the
weekend and some of the projects that
I've seen already so far are like pretty
good yeah good I'm even more excited to
like see what people take the whole we
ken's to finish up polishing and all
that kind of stuff but I'm not going to
grade anybody any different depending on
when they handed in I've got to address
this the same thing was said about
vessel how successful it was and it was
an epic failure in the end so eat it
Linus the thing is is that vessel had a
very different model vessel was a start
up with like over a hundred million
dollars we think a venture capital that
they managed to burn through in eighteen
months now I've never had any outside
investment so that is not the way that I
personally run the businesses that I own
and/or am a stakeholder in it is not the
way that I believe in doing business
having a really high burn rate and just
kind of hoping that well I don't know
what they were hoping for to be
perfectly honest now that we know how
their infrastructure worked it was way
too expensive I don't know how they
could have ever possibly hoped to make a
profit I feel like the goal the whole
time was just to try to get eaten and
bought out by somebody because like it
seems insane so remember to though the
people saying what a great huge success
that vessel was were the people that
were trying to talk other people into
joining it or complete Outsiders from
like an investor relations standpoint
yeah we don't need investors and we are
not recruiting anybody to join
floatplane club at this time we are just
really happy that an internal project is
going really really well and to be fair
if we were saying that vessel was going
well we were probably talking about like
well our or not our production schedule
is working and it's and our fans seem to
be happy and that kind of stuff we
weren't talking about like profit
structures and whatever else yeah
so yeah no hotkeys and stuff that is the
thing that will happen eventually yeah
so I'm not going to work on that yet ah
what if we don't have a credit card to
use on PayPal for floatplane that is
something that we are working on can we
give any progress update on that the the
final site that is being developed on
will be using stripe and PayPal so if
you can't use PayPal for whatever reason
there's various reasons why you might
not be able to use PayPal we can accept
whatever cards through stripe and stripe
has a lot of different things that they
can assemble except they're pretty good
system yeah so it won't be tied to just
PayPal forever while it's on the forum
it will be just PayPal yeah yeah um you
know what there's a lot of actually
pretty decent questions in here why
don't we stop the land show and do a
short afterparty
sure okay so thanks for watching same
bat-time same bat-channel bye go back to
the second
how dare you tell me to go away how dare
you I know you would dare to do far more
than that's me
I still still streaming oh and we're
also doing a short after party so OH</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
