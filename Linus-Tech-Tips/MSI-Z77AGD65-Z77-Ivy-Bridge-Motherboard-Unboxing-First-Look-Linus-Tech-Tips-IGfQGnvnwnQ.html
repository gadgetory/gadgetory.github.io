the z7 sense that does e77 a GD 65 this
is Emma thighs first board that I've had
a look at on the brand-new Zed 77
platform from Intel so this is using a
new chipset supporting Intel 3rd
generation Core i5 and core i7
processors on LGA 1155 so yes 22
nanometer CPU ready it is also sli ready
and crossfire ready compatible with
Windows 7 it better be and supports
Intel Core Series processes which it had
better
alright PCI Express generation 3 is also
supported it should be noted of course
of course yeah MSI brought this up that
they were the first with a PCI Express
generation 3 ready motherboard and that
was on the z68 platform as well as
virtue MVP so a little bit more on that
in a moment it comes with a three year
warranty in USA canada and mexico
includes there one second overclocking
OC Genie 2 OC Genie now overclocks more
than just the cpu which is a very cool
thing as well as click BIOS 2 which is
their graphical UEFI BIOS click BIOS 2
is 10 times better than click BIOS 1 and
I would say the best UEFI implementation
that I have used so far I love click
BIOS 2 it's very easy to navigate we're
gonna switch spots here change places
all right OC Genie overclocked in one
second it probably takes less than a
second actually and provides an instant
performance boost to CPU memory and
integrated graphics an apparently
storage device performance cool at least
36 percent boost in 3d gaming
performance that's probably assuming
you're using the onboard GPU
alright military class three so they are
excusing their that they're using their
dr moss - so this is their
next-generation there dr moss the
concept was originally introduced on
their p55 boards and was one of the
things that drove msi p55 boards at
least here at NCIX where i work to be
one of the most popular ones out there
so this is a next generation of that
proven technology we've also got hi-c
caps super ferrite chokes as well as
solid caps built into this board let's
go ahead and open it up yes ok super
charger is awesome because you can
charge your iPad iPhone / mobile at high
speed even when your PC is shut down so
that is even when your CPU is in the
lowest possible resting state which is
powered game certificate of quality and
stability okay sure
you guys won't need this that's for me
drive that won't be in the retail box
drivers and utilities DVD download the
latest
off of the MSI website quick
installation guide oh this looks really
big actually we got to show you all the
different components with little
diagrams and stuff handy next software
an application exclusive user friendly
feature collection okay
so shows you how to use their various
software applications who teaming geni
provides traffic load balancing and
redundant NIC operation if network
connection fails cool
haha we have Oh neat even on a GT 65
level board we've got the little cables
for measuring the voltage directly off
the board as opposed to through the BIOS
that's very cool
alright next we've got four SATA three
six gigabit per second right angle
cables and yes based on my testing it
doesn't matter that there's SATA 3 but
that's what they are so I'm gonna call
them what they are we've also got an i/o
shield ha
flexible black SLI bridge my very
favorite kind the users guide lots of
accessories here guys we've also got
their M connectors which allow you to
more easily connect your front panel
connectors including USB 2 as well as
your you know power switch reset switch
and all that good stuff and finally the
board itself I'm really looking forward
to checking out this board because MSI
in the last few generations has done
such a good job on the aesthetics and as
you guys know if you watched my video
where are you standing really close to
me for a reason
no no I don't want the shadow so sorry
about that guys there's a bit of a
miscommunication where you know I was
uncomfortable too slick was standing too
close but he deemed it necessary so you
know I got over it anyway here we go so
we've got our LGA 1155 processor as well
as all of our built in military class
PWM here you can see their military
class three branding and this is this is
okay so yes the gun thing is a little
bit played out but the good news is that
on the MSI board you can kind of ignore
it you know if you're looking at it from
a normal angle which would be above it a
little bit and at least it's tastefully
implemented guys that's all I'm saying
here so we've got blue and black
anodized with silver accents heat sinks
I am definitely big into the aesthetics
of my motherboards because they make a
difference to how your entire system
looks and these ones look really really
sharp alright we've got our 8 pin CPU
power connector in its ideal location up
at the top left we have support for dual
channel ddr3 memory this is in line with
the CPU remember this supports either
Ivy Bridge CPUs or last generation Sandy
Bridge processors so you can install any
LGA 1155 processor that you want in this
motherboard you're just gonna get the
best performance out of a new Ivy Bridge
chip up here we've got some LEDs
we've got our OC Genie button which I've
featured in the past although we haven't
tried OC Genie 2 so I'm looking forward
to trying that also our power and reset
buttons V checkpoints for a wide variety
of different motherboard components
including the onboard graphics on the
CPU which to my understanding can be
overclocked especially since OC Genie
doesn't hurt to my understanding our 24
pin connectors at its ideal location
along the right hand edge of the board
we also have a front USB 3 header here
so this is running off of the Intel USB
3 so there are 4 Intel USB 3 ports that
are running directly off of the Intel
chipset here we have the intel SE 2 3 6
gigabit per second ports which are going
to be the highest performance one we've
got Intel say 2 to 3 gigabit per second
parts as well as third-party say 2 3 6
gigabit per second ports here is a
little post meter so you can diagnose
easily any posting issues as well as
they're super just a sec sorry guys
here's the supercharger red-coated which
means you can charge things faster off
of this port here's a regular USB 2
header as well as another one here's our
multi BIOS switch so it has dual BIOS
integrated on the board and you can
easily switch between them so this is
helpful if you have a dialed in
overclock you really don't want to screw
it up and then you want to try something
else you can also flash different
revisions of the BIOS so that you can
find out is the new BIOS you know
perfect for my needs or is it not and if
you don't like it you can go back to the
old one just like that very cool
world's first PCI Express gen3 we can
take that sticker off there we are and
moving along we've got trusted platform
module we've got some LED guys aha
there's our front panel connectors as
well as our front audio so I was looking
for those guys next we have the slot
layout so we have no legacy PCI on this
board one two three PCIe 16 although
I'll get into why they're not quite PCIe
16 in just a moment as well as four PCIe
one so this guy runs at 16x if you put a
single graphics card in up to 16x pcie
3.0 then if you put in two PCI Express
3.0 ready graphics cards these two are
going to run at 8 X + 8 X remember PCIe
3/8 X is equivalent to PCIe - 16 X so
even with high-end graphics cards you
shouldn't get any
necking as long as you're using a PCIe
three ready CPU that is Ivybridge two
PCIe three ready slots and PCIe three
ready graphics cards this last guy right
here due to bandwidth limitations so
that is how many PCIe three lanes are
running off of the CPU
it's recommended to only use this one if
you're running an Ivy Bridge CPU next
moving on to the back panel control our
back panel IO we've got four USB 2.0
ports the ps2 port which I still do like
to see guys clear CMOS switch optical
and coaxial audio out HDMI Gigabit
Ethernet two USB 3.0 ports running off
the Intel chipset VGA DVI and 7.1 audio
out here's another thing that you guys
may or may not have seen just yet
actually hold on a second yeah yeah here
we go so you see that little I felt you
see that little virtual logo right there
this board uses virtue MVP which is a
more flexible updated version of the
original lucid virtu which was on the
Azis did z68 platform i think hold on
sorry guys age 67 and so what this
allows you to do is you can use your
user you can use your integrated GPU to
do quick sync which is your quick video
encoding that's running off of the
graphics core on the CPU itself and with
virtue MVP you can also use your
integrated CPU to boost the performance
of even a high powered dedicated
graphics card as long as the game
supports it so that's a pretty neat
thing I haven't tested this out yet
though but I'm very excited to check it
out don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos sorry guys I
forgot the fan headers we've got one two
three I saw another one three PWM fan
headers as well as two three pin fan
headers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
