premium product from masseuse so you can
tell from the deluxe moniker that this
is a high-end board
this is their p8p 67 so I'm gonna go
ahead and interpret that for you
p8 means it is the current generation of
Intel CPUs so that means we have full
support for Intel's LGA 1155 socket
processors P 67 is the chipset Deluxe is
what this board is all about so you're
gonna find pretty much every feature
that you could possibly want we have
dual Gigabit LAN we have USB 3.0 we have
a Bluetooth okay we'll have to figure
out what that is in a minute bluetooth
enjoyment all right we have full digital
vrm which is the most precise and this
this one's actually the big one for me
EF I BIOS so that means that you have a
full Mouse interface with your bios
including support for things like a
scroll wheel like imagine that Mouse
would scroll wheel support in the BIOS
okay so moving over here to the
right-hand side of the front of the box
haywire oh hold on I'll turn it off for
a second okay so full support for the
Intel Core series of processors on 1155
you got the P 67 chipset and that's
pretty much everything that's there up
here this is interesting so they have
their digital VRM EPU so that's there
I think it's efficiency processing unit
or it's basically for making things more
energy-efficient and then they also have
their TPU ok those are dedicated
processors moving over to this side we
have the world's first okay so the
ultimate turbo processor TPU is a chip
for their auto turning tuning and turbo
B functions so that is their automated
overclocking if also about the EFI BIOS
which I talked about already
AI suite 2 is their Windows software so
it consolidates all of their sous
features into one software package okay
we've got their EP u which is as I said
before is for energy efficiency and we
have support for all that this isn't
quad GPU SLI and quad GPU crossfire X
okay DTS surround and let's move along
to the back
I like this box I love it when there's a
window to see the boardroom big fan of
that actually ok so let's find out what
beat ego is ok bluetooth mono it just
means it has bluetooth oh that's simple
then ok digital power design the new
standards so they're new generation and
intelligent processors with the G+ VRM
control and that's 16 plus 2 wow that's
a lot of phases so they have a 16 plus 2
phase power design on this particular
board basically that's to deliver
cleaner power to your CPU it should
allow in theory for better overclocking
so that's a good thing
complete USB 3.0 solution including back
panel as well as front panel USB and
they've called out the front panel USB
again here extra SATA 6 gigabits per
second support so you actually have 4
ports on this board
whereas with all of the previous
generation watch say almost all of the
previous generation Intel boards that is
on the p55 chipset we'd only see two USB
2.0 or 3.0 ports and 2 SATA 6 gigabits
per second ports so let's have a look at
what we have in terms of accessory
package we've got an i/o shield we have
4 SATA 6 gigabits per second ports and
to say the 3 gigabit per second ports
please note these are identical other
than the colors on the cables there is
no reason that you can't use one for the
other and vice versa we have an SLI
bridge we have their two connectors so
that allows you to easily plug in your
front panel connectors and then plug the
whole brick into your motherboard we
have a front panel USB this thing's
heavy
ok so here it is so front panel USB 3.0
box it's got a nice sort of finish on
the top of it here that is quite quite
classy it plugs into our rather slots
into a three and a half inch drive bay
and then this cable is going to run over
to your motherboard where they have a
USB 3.0 front panel header
I hope standing oh yeah there's what it
looks like from the front as well ok so
that's a great
feature especially because most cases
these days don't have USB 3.0 integrated
in may in a head with a header on them
like that in the front
so did you plz show there's a little
user guide and here is your full user
guide for this motherboard including a
powered by su sticker and a DVD that you
don't need because you can download the
latest drivers and utilities off of the
assist website let's pull this guy out
and have a look at what there is to see
on the PAP 67 deluxe so first of all
tell you guys I really like the
aesthetic of this particular board it's
pretty much in line with what they were
doing on their p55 boards other than the
Republic of gamers series board so we've
got kind of a pale and dark blue and
white and black color scheme which
actually goes together a lot better than
it might initially sound like as you
guys can obviously see I love what a
soos has been doing lately with their
PWM heatsink designs my personal
favorite was their what I call their
fortress of solitude one where it was
kind of like a spiky thing but I like
this too this is kind of like could be
waves or it could be grass could be kind
of anything actually very abstract I
like it you can see the 16 phase power
design under these heat sinks ok so
there's probably gonna yep there's a
couple more going around the corner over
here and then they've also got some of
their key issues branding on the board
as well so they've got their dual
intelligent processors 2 over here as
well as a sous logos sprinkled liberally
along the board ok so let's have a look
at the layout then and I'm just gonna
lift this up so we can start in the
middle where we have our LGA 1155 socket
so as I mentioned before that has full
support for Intel's new core series
processors on the 1155 socket and here
in the top left corner we have our 8 pin
connector exactly where it belongs in
its optimal ideal and preferred location
over on the right side of the board we
have our four ddr3 slots supporting dual
channel operation as well as our 24-pin
connector
it's ideal location along the right hand
edge of the board we have our memo pay
button here as well as their TPU
processor switch so bear in mind that is
there okay let's keep moving down the
board we're going to find our USB 3.0
header this might seem like an odd
location for it but when you look at how
short the cable is on the front panel
connector that is probably the reason
for the header to be located there so
when you plug this in in the front of
your case right you're going to only
have to run it this far to get to the
USB 3 header so you can pretty much
reach anywhere in front of a typical
case without any hassle okay in terms of
storage we have SATA 6 gigabits per
second so those are color coded dark
blue and white and then we have 4 SATA 3
gigabit per second parts which are
color-coded pale blue here's our chipset
heatsink ok wrong you take this off you
can see it a little bit like that
check that out so it actually has a bit
of texture to the suits logo on there it
looks really really sharp aesthetics
matter to me guys I I actually do care
when I'm shopping for a motherboard I
want to I have a windowed case and the
cameraman is looking at my Star Wars
t-shirt again I have a windowed case and
I do like to see a nice looking board
because really that the largest thing in
your case so it's gonna be kind of
overwhelming if it's ugly so here we
have a LED post indicator so that will
give you any error codes if you're
having problems getting your system to
boot up and next over here we have our
USB 2.0 front panel headers we have a
reset and power switch both built in
there's our epu switch so that's for the
other intelligent processor and then
moving up to our PCI slot layouts so we
have one two PCIe 1x slots we have two
PCIe 16x slots but please note the p67
chipset alright yea p67 chipset much
like the p55 chipset has support for a
single card in 16x mode two cards in 8x
mode and not two cards in 16x mode ok it
doesn't matter in terms of performance
but it is a distinction that you should
be aware of if you want duel 16x slots
you're gonna have to move up to X 58 so
we've got 2 PCIe 2 PCI slots if you have
any legacy devices and then down here
this is a physical PCIe 16x slot but
this one operates only at 4x so you can
either put a 1 X card down here or you
can put in a 4 X card like a RAID
controller or something else like that
really high-end Nick whatever the case
may be moving along to the back of the
board we have all of these options so
let's oh yeah there's our Bluetooth ok
so we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 USB 2.0 ports
we have one of those ps2 mouse keyboard
combo ports that I'm so fond of we have
optical audio out as well as coaxial
audio out to eSATA ports and then we've
also got like I said before our
Bluetooth we have one firewire port we
have two gigabit ethernet ports and I
should mention these are running off of
the Intel built in land rather than a
third party controller and that's one of
the things that is seuss actually calls
out write on their board Intel Ethernet
great capability ok we have a clear CMOS
which as well as 7.1 analog audio on the
back of the motherboard that pretty much
covers everything I wanted to say about
the p8 p67 deluxe thank you for checking
