powered by HyperX check out their cloud
tube headset in the video description
down below also thank you to a soos and
Corsair alright guys welcome to the
HyperX booth we're gonna be checking out
two headsets here today the first one is
the cloud core now that is very very
similar to the cloud one to the point
that it's a cloud one except it comes
with slightly less accessories and is at
a lower MSRP so it cost seventy dollars
which is ten dollars cheaper than a
cloud one and doesn't come with a travel
carrying couch a airplane adapter and
interchangeable ear cuffs so if you're
not gonna be traveling on an airplane or
traveling kind of at all with this
headset and you don't want to
interchange your ear cups probably we're
saving that ten bucks which makes this a
very aggressively priced headset pretty
interesting now if you guys want to step
it up a notch you can go to the cloud -
I know you guys already know all about
the cloud - but I have two interesting
tidbits of information regardless first
off is if you act quickly
you can get them on Amazon for a fairly
actually heavily reduced price at $79.99
that's only a $9 and $0.99 Delta
compared to the cloud course if you want
to get the more premium experience this
is a little bit tagged on compared to
normally it would be a $30 Delta over
the cloud core for that minor increase
in price you get a few nice features
like an active noise cancelling
microphone which will sound better for
your buddies and a USB sound card and
7.1 surround sound virtual surround
sound set up which may or may not sound
better for you depending on what kind of
styles you like also if you're running a
gaming rig like my mom which is all
white and a keyboard like my mom which
is white and pink you might have been
waiting for more headset options now we
have a cloud 2 in exactly that white and
pink I'm sure the two people that I know
that will be excited about it are my mom
and Linus alright guys that's it thank
you to HyperX for sending us here this
year and check out their YouTube channel

soos and Corsair if you guys want to see
