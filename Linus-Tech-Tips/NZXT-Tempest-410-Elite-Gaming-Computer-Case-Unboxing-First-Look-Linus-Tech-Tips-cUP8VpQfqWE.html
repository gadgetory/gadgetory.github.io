the tempest 410 elite so the elite
version has a side panel window this is
a crafted mid tower
according to NZXT and what do we have to
say for ourselves on the front so it has
a two year warranty although that's
pretty much completely irrelevant
because if the case isn't DOA it
probably will maintain its core
functionality over the course of its
lifetime I guess maybe the fans might
matter okay they expect out their
clearances they expect out the cooling
what's included what's not included bays
and expansions so seven expansion slots
so this is a standard ATX case on the
back let's see what NZXT
blurb is I always enjoy these blurbs an
aggressive cooling solution forged for
your ring the tempest 410 Elite mid
tower completes your fine-tuned machine
by taking advantage of the air flow
required for the enthusiasts
overclocking needs the tempest legacy
expands it's maximized ventilation
through the extra-large honeycomb mesh
design so my understanding is this kit
actually uses honeycomb mesh for all of
its openings that are designed for
airflow that's kind of neat gives you
better airflow cool dual radiator
support and dual touch powered front
fans oh okay I lost my borrow was in the
sentence there it's okay in addition to
the basics the elite includes USB 3 in
an acrylic side panel for interior
viewing if you're looking for a new
cooling edge for your gameplay the
temperature for 10 will bring you the
results of epic win well alright then I
am going to go ahead and break the seals
on this epic win result and we will have
a look at this case and see what we
think of it so let's go ahead it's like
in heavy I've done a few case unboxings
here and I'm like getting warm so just
gonna go ahead and get rid of that
before I start sweating all over camera
here okay we've got our packing
materials these are very very thick
the real ow these are very very stiff
very thick foam - look at that they've
actually see this
the kind of consideration that I really
like to see check this out so you've got
kind of standard one inch on the sides
you've got kind of thin on the front
okay why did they do that I'll show you
why they did that because they thickened
it up at the back to prevent weight up
front okay Oh cuz it's smaller no but
here's something they have done is they
recessed the screws so many companies
forget to do this that's what I was
looking at when I was thinking of that
they put a recess into here you can see
the same thing at the bottom so even
though it uses a stiff foam the screws
are not going to break it I've seen so
many cases come with broken packing
materials these screws pressing into it
and cracking the foam as soon as this
foam is cracked it loses its integrity
because it's not a closed cell phone
which you'll see in the higher-end cases
it is a like more of a stiff a hard foam
so what happens is as soon as it's
cracked it's pretty much useless it's
designed like a helmet for one major
impact and then beyond that you don't
expect too much this actually looks
really nice it has a good overall feel
to it good weight so it's not super
light but it's not super heavy and very
very sort of okay it's not clean lines
because it's more of a gaming styled
case as we've come to expect from NZXT
but it's not over-the-top either to the
point where it's very polarizing like
like some of their competitors gaming
lines of cases where people either love
them or they just hate the look of them
I don't think there's anything to really
hate about the look of this case so why
don't we start with the front so on the
front we find lots of honeycomb mesh so
you can see this not only has honeycomb
mesh but also like a fine mesh behind it
for dust filtration presumably these
come out very easily this is a feature
that I love on NZXT cases because I hate
around with these things it's a pain if
you just feel like that comes in comes
out you don't have to like math it out
from the from the back or anything like
that also in the front oh and these are
my these are my favorite okay this is
something that I first saw introduced I
believe with the h2 there we go
how's it going there we go so both sides
check this out oh no fan cabling what do
you think of that so you see these
contacts right here that's your four pin
PWM that's just a simple pass through so
then on here you see the contacts for
power and then you can actually adapt
any fan for use with this with this LED
here that goes our sled cage whatever
you want to call it that goes into the
front or rather three pin just by
plugging this in here and then by taking
the whole thing and clicking it into the
front love that I think that's a great
feature because wiring up the front the
front fans on a given case can be a
total nightmare and as often it just
really really clumsy the way it's done
this is very very elegant I'm gonna go
ahead and pull these out just so that we
have access to the front loaded three
and a half inch hard drive trays and
check out how many there are yes that is
eight three and a half inch hard drive
cages also with support for two and a
half inch SSDs so you can see the holes
are here and then here okay that is not
how that is meant to work and don't
worry that should not reflect poorly on
the case itself let me show you how that
is intended to work if you put it in
straight and it clips in if you put it
in had an angle and it falls right
through so ah be careful when mounting
hard drives in this case because if you
put it into a random angle you're gonna
drop a hard drive into the back of your
computer it's gonna break your video
card you're gonna have a bad day alright
front panel connectors we've got front
panel oh these aren't labeled okay well
it's not the end of the world I guess
you just have to try and remember one of
them is Mike one of them is headphone
front USB three front USB two times
three and we've got our front hard ride
and power LEDs power switch is acts
from here from the top and then we have
a reset switch all in addition to that
here we find a little storage
compartment which is kind of neat and
what's also neat about this is check
this out okay we've got a cable routing
channel here so what happens is I've got
a pair of headphones that have about oh
man they must have like a three meter
cable on them
typically my gaming Tower sits sort of
next to me right about here do I need
three meters if I'm plugged into the
front panel audio I don't think so so
what you can do is you can plug in your
front panel audio run the cable just up
here into this channel coil it up in
here run it out this channel and then
you can take it sort of down here and
over to where it needs to go without
interfering with your optical drives or
anything like that so that's pretty cool
and then finally there's a little bit
storage Cheryl look at that it stays
where you put it smart alright also on
the top of the case I realize I'm
spending a lot of time on the top of
this case but there's a lot of stuff
here we have honeycomb mesh once again
and we have a dedicated spot for a dual
120 millimeter water cooling radiator
and fans so the whole thing just clips
in like that covers it up or doesn't
cover it up whatever you prefer so you
can either take your radiator and put it
on the top actually yeah yeah so you've
got space for they've given you all the
flexibility in the world here you can
either run your tubing down this side or
you can run your tubing down this side
so you can have the radiator on top for
a nice clean clean aesthetic because
you'll just see radiator fins through
here or you can put your fans on the top
and mount the radiator directly to the
case and you can see like your LEDs or
whatever else like that so that's that's
also a pretty cool thing that they've
thought of with this case let's look at
the back so at the back we find a 120
millimeter cooling fan these things
which I'm not a huge fan of especially
when you have like a dedicated place to
mount a dual rad in the top so I don't
see why you'd do an external water
cooling setup IO
seven PCI slots bottom-mounted power
supply and look at this a hard drive
sled alright let's open this baby up
these thumb screws are pretty tight I'm
gonna go ahead and got my screwdriver so
just for a change of pace we're gonna do
the back panel first I've removed the
screws now so remember they're not
always tight if you put them in finger
tight you'll be able to get them out
with your fingers so it's not like oh
these are magic thumb screws that only
work with a screwdriver guess they might
as well not abuse some screws it's not
like that it's just a matter of them
being tightened a little bit too much at
the factory so it was hard to get off
all right on the back here we have lots
of room for cable management check that
out
in fact 23 millimeters of clearance is
what they are specking out here and I
believe it that looks very good we've
also got lots of room for cables to come
through here come up through here up
through here up through here so there's
your eight pin connector that's where
that one's gonna go and then this is
this is also something I really love to
see lots of little loops see these
little loops these are all four zip ties
so you can take all of your cables that
you're managing zip tie them so that
they stay nice and flat and so it
doesn't interfere with each other and
make it difficult to close the other
panel of the case they've also
reinforced the strength of their
motherboard back panel by putting in
these bumps like this they are actually
significantly adding to the rigidity of
the motherboard backplane this can be
important when shipping a system
particularly so if you're ordering a
system online you can be pretty
confident going with something like a
tempest 410 Elite other than that I see
places to put screws into your optical
drives I see places - I don't know what
those are for do you guys know what
these are for let me know because I
don't I see places to plug in the fan
leads to those front fan connectors and
other than that I think we're pretty
much done with the back panel let's move
over to the other side where we have a
nice
side window design all right which gives
you a view of your hard drive cables
okay that I could sort of maybe going
this way might have been a little bit
better but that wouldn't have looked as
good with the overall slant of the case
and the overall design but either way
you're gonna be able to see your
graphics card your CPU all your
fancy-pants hardware and I'm just gonna
lay it down to make my life a little bit
easier here guys so here are all of your
internal connectors so there's power
that's gonna power those fans in all
likelihood we've also got front USB
three front USB two HD audio other more
different front USB two front panel
connectors so your power switch your
reset switch all that good stuff and
these are all black cables love it even
the USB 3 cable is black up to the point
where it plugs into the motherboard but
it has to be color-coded very nice love
to see it
in terms of included accessories and
documentation it's all in here so 17
different languages good on you ends at
XT you clearly intend to sell these
worldwide or have really sort of strange
policies about selling only in the US if
I really don't know how many people
speak oh no oh no these are seventeen
hahaha seventeen things that are labeled
in this picture in only one two three
four five six seven eight different
languages so I was wrong
alright so that gives you the steps for
how to install most of the stuff in the
unit 410 I'd rather the tempest 410
elite here we've got some zip ties very
nice we've got some look at the bags are
all labeled so you got standoffs you got
m35 flats
you've got some 632 screws flat and six
thirty two screws hexagons very nice
so we got here
we have thumbscrews so I guess that's
somewhere to store additional
thumbscrews or what actually it looks
like that may be the case
these look like optical drive bay screws
you know what give me a second I'm gonna
find out what these are so figured out
what it is it's in the manual go figure
read the blank manual so I'm gonna go
ahead I'm gonna show you guys what you
do you install the hard drive you take
this out it's a really long screw so
then you go ahead and put it here and
you secure your hard drive in place that
is what you do with it
all right so let's look more closely at
the inside of the case as a whole so in
the front we've got our two 120mm fans
we can put one more 120mm fan here we
have a filtered see there's a fan filter
on there there's a mesh we have a
filtered gap for the power supply to get
fresh air from the bottom of the case we
also have rubber fen or rubber case feet
that will keep it off the ground or
table or wherever you're keeping it so
you're going to get some airflow to your
power supply no big deal power supply
you can have almost any length of power
supply even up to like here so you're
not going to have any clearance issues
with your drives in terms of video cards
though I'm not sure but I'm gonna go
ahead and grab a 69 90 since I happen to
have one handy here I guess I'll have to
do a GTX 590 first on account of I can't
get the hold on oh sure whatever lab
count I can't get the 6990 out without
taking these first so one 590 move Apple
590 okay let's try that one so the Apple
590 is gonna go right about here so
you're gonna have to be yeah you're
probably gonna have to take out a couple
of hard drive cages if you want to put a
69 90 in here although I mean very few
people actually buy 69 90s it's just the
kind of thing I like to mention if it
comes up so as soon as I as I take these
out I should have enough room for that
particular
Pathak's card that that and yeah so that
would fit so it will fit up to a sixty
nine ninety which at this time is the
longest most power-hungry graphics card
out there all right on the top we've got
those dual 120 s or dual 140 s in the
back we've got that 120 and I think that
pretty much covers everything I wanted
to say about the tempest 410 elite this
is actually a really nice looking case
great quality to the paint finish I love
the finish of the paint on here and it
matches between the metal and plastic
parts very very well which is difficult
to do so the inside looks very similar
to the plastic top here you actually
can't really see much difference here at
all that should not be taken for granted
like I said very very difficult don't
