of a board from a soos this is the P 6 X
58 d e so let's get quickly zoomed in
here
yeah I've got my camera propped on my
makeshift cardboard cat tree which my
cat is now exploring this may end badly
if I do not end the video no no please
leaving the camera alone that works okay
so this is part of their updated x58
board so you can tell because there's a
D at the end that stands for USB 3.0
which they're calling out here as true
USB 3.0 as well as true SATA 6 gigabit
per second so then we've also got
support for 16 plus 2 phase power as
well as SLI and crossfire it is an LGA
1366 motherboard so that means you've
got support for all intel core i7 and
core i7 extreme CPUs on that socket and
then you can see this is also an extreme
design board so that means the deceased
is going for number one reliability
performance and safety here let's move
around to the back of the board now true
USB 3.0 and Troost and six gigabit per
second as soos is calling that out
because of the unique way that they have
been able to deliver the bandwidth
required by those technologies now Isuzu
uses a chip to split the PCIe lanes to
make sure if you're running SLI or
crossfire they will get all the
bandwidth that they need so 3-way SLI
quad GPU crossfire X that's all good and
fine a hundred percent long like solid
capacitors they've also got their stack
cool three-plus technologies that cool
just means lots of copper in the PCB
allows it to dissipate heat more easily
and they're calling it a unique layout I
guess we'll have to have a look and see
what I think of their unique layout as
well as precision Tweaker to software so
let's get the board open up here and you
can see that once I remove the outer
sleeve it looks exactly the same okay
up here let's get this board open up and
have a look at the accessories that are
included the cat is eating Johnathan
fatality Wendell's rim so I'm gonna go
ahead and move that way okay first of
all we have an IO shield it gives us a
Seuss's puppy shiny back but it is not
color coded next we have the user's
guide which also has a driver and
utilities DVD in here don't use this
download the lead to stop the assist
website there's also a little powered by
a su sticker very nice ok the manual
itself is in all English so it's quite a
thick manual gives you some details on
the BIOS some details on the physical
layout of your board all of that good
stuff now I may have actually made a
mistake when I said that they needed a
bridge chip to get full USB 3.0 and SATA
6 gigabit per second so I'm gonna
correct myself now that's only honest
thesis p55 boards not on their x58
boards with x58 there are more PCIe
lanes and it is not necessary so in the
as far as the SATA cables go as Seuss's
included four SATA 2 cables ok so two of
them are right angle and two of them are
straight connector and then they've also
included 2 SATA 6 gigabits per second
cables now I use the finger quotes
because really they're exactly the same
thing but these ones are white and black
in old cool-lookin so I would use those
if it was up to me next we have a 3-way
SLI bridge as well as a regular flexible
SLI bridge then we've also got an empty
baggie which probably contained a 3-way
SLI bridge at some point that I guess it
came out during shipping just goes to
show you shipping link anything can
happen in shipping I've seen some weird
stuff ok and then we have their cute
connector so if you can you can hook up
your front panel connectors as well as
your USB 2 doubles and then plug those
right into the motherboard now let's get
the board out and see what we have in
store here so I'm just going to close
this box so that I can get a good look
at this
all right Betty Betty open I love
motherboards because the way they
package it makes it really easy for me
to remove it from the box it's very nice
there's no seals no nothing it's all
very very simple that way okay so let's
have a look at the layout of this board
first of all in the very center I'm just
going to zoom in a touch here for you so
that you can see a little bit better on
this as well as I can alright there we
go so in the center we will find our LGA
1366 socket it is a load socket not a
Foxconn socket for those of you who care
unless you know what I'm referring to
you probably don't care so don't worry
about it we've got nice beefy looking
vrm coolers here I mean they're not huge
but what they are is they're efficient
looking so they're just a simple fin
design on both sides okay so you can see
this one's actually attached via a heat
pipe to the Northbridge cooler here and
then there is no heat pipe moving over
to the Southbridge but that's not really
necessary the Southbridge here the
ich10r does not put out a whole lot of
heat next of all we have the eight pin
CPU power connector up in its ideal
location at the top left then we have
support for triple channel ddr3 memory
populating the blue slots first now this
is actually something that i've never
mentioned before although its present on
as far as I know every x58 board the
primary channels that you're gonna
populate are always the ones that are
further away from the CPU and the reason
for that is because there are many large
CPU coolers these days and most
customers only buy one triple channel
kit in the lifetime of the board so the
manufacturers have cleverly made the
primary channels the ones further away
so it gives you that one extra slot if
you have high profile memory that you
can use to populate that space with your
cooler so there you go there's your
tidbit for the day we have a memo k
button here so that means that it'll set
any memory in here - very very default
timings so that you can make sure you
can post even with high performance Stix
here we've got this oh we've got
standard round clips that's interesting
so normally on a Seuss's boards they
have only a one sided Ram clip but it
looks like we've actually got clips on
both sides on this board not sure why
they've made that
we've got a 24-pin power connector in
its ideal location along the right-hand
edge of the board and moving down the
board we have the Southbridge streaming
things then we okay here we go here it
gets to gets more interesting again so
the top one is the two great ports here
those are SATA 6 gigabits per second
running off of a Marvel chipset here
these two right here the powder blue
ones are a say that sorry my cats are
playing with the bag and they're
probably gonna destroy it anyway okay so
these are SATA 2 next we have over volt
dram bus and overall qpi dram jumpers so
I wish I knew exactly what those are
please leave a comment if you know
exactly what those jumpers are for then
down here at the bottom we've got two
more SATA 2 ports here we have our front
panel connectors and then we've got a
couple of USB 2.0 front headers and then
moving on right along we've got an
onboard power switch that's the biggest
one I need a lot of manufacturers
include like onboard power onboard
speaker on board reset but the power is
the big one I do like seeing an on board
see mostly player but that one's
actually on the back i/o shield in this
board so that's even better
okay so PCI Express slot layout first of
all we've got our two PCIe 16x slots
these are going to be our two blue
primary ones and if you populate both of
those with a dual slot graphics card you
will be left with one PCIe 16x slot and
one PCIe 1x slot I don't mind seeing
both of the PCI slots covered on a board
like this because let's face it you're
if you're buying a high-end x58 board
you're living in two graphics cards you
don't need PCI slots you should probably
have a PCIe updated PCIe add-in cards so
that brings us right around to the very
back of the board where we've got our
i/o shield so you've got two ps2 ports
you know I'm still not done with ps2
personally I find that when you're
trying to get into the BIOS or sometimes
when you're installing applications USB
keyboards don't always get recognized
I love having ps2 ports available to me
then we have a clear CMOS switch right
here two USB 3.0 ports optical audio out
coaxial audio out digital both then we
have four USB 2.0 ports one FireWire
port Gigabit Ethernet
and 7.1 audio so thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the P
6 X 58 d e motherboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
