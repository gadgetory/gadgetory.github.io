the sallman
z11 plus h f1 or hellfire one this is
pretty similar to the Zalman z11 plus
that we took a look at before so we're
not going to go too much into the
details of the case itself but more into
what separates the hf 1 edition from the
regular case you can also check out my
previous unboxing of the Zalman z11 plus
just by searching for it on the youtubes
let's go ahead and open this up you've
got your hard foam packaging not my
favorite but the corners are well
protected so I wouldn't expect you to
run into any issues with this particular
one now what's special about the hf
sorry yeah hf 1 edition of the case is
the fact that it has a pretty color
scheme that if you're into you know you
know garden demonic games like ah you
know dungeon crawlers that involve like
hell and fire that might be a pretty
good match if you wanted to do a PV
system around something like that go
ahead and check this out so be it right
so the z11 plus is pretty much what
we've come to expect good cooling so the
whole front is got excellent ventilation
it's just go ahead and oh oh it's so
close so close to getting in one piece
so at the front we've got our 120
millimeter cooling fan we've also got
ample ventilation the hard drives again
again ample cooling from the additional
ventilation that's available here the
side window is actually very very unique
so it kind of pops out which might seem
like kind of an odd design choice at the
beginning but then if you go oh wait
what if the end user wanted a huge tower
cooler on their CPU that would be a way
to achieve it because there's lots and
lots of room for that at the top you got
a little tray for storing things you've
also got your front USB 2 for an audio
front USB 3 power switch reset switch
and your hard drive indicator LED but I
actually kind of like
designs as long as the manufacturer
leaves enough space for ventilation
where it looks clean from the front and
you've got lots of cooling from the back
so you know business in the front party
in the back
um this one like the design I've seen
ones in the last of a while that I
didn't like it as much because there's
like this much of a gap and like no
actual room for airflow but this is this
is fun ok from the back you got your i/o
you've got your 120 millimeter fan you
got 7 PCI slots and your standard
standard these days I guess it didn't
used to be standard not that long ago
but bought a mounted power supply so
let's go ahead and open this baby up so
you guys can whoops it's okay talk about
if you can if you haven't seen this up
in place yet you can have a look at it
from the inside so there's an 80
millimeter cooling fan that's going to
take care of your drive cooling also got
a black sleeve Kaiba let's get little
details like that do count you guys and
then in the front you've got your red
LED fan in the back you've got another
red LED fan in terms of included
accessories you've got on look at that
they include an 8 pin power quick
extension see again details details they
count all of your included hardware goes
PCI brackets and then you can mount this
is actually actually neat as well
because a lot of the time the the back
of your PCIe slots can get extremely hot
because graphic cards are hot and they
blow heat down on them so you can throw
a little 60ml fan in there to take care
of that we've also got another 120
millimeter red LED fan up here in the
top and these are all using silver
cables I don't mind silver cables I'd
prefer black but it's not the end of the
world got your cable management holes
you've got your motherboard CPU cut out
for easy installation of large
aftermarket coolers ah this is kind of
disappointing you've got a USB 3 pass
through so you'll plug these into the
back of the board would have preferred
to see an internal header in this day
and age we've got another 80 millimeter
fan on the other side not might come in
handy again for drive cooling and all of
your drive rails are included where
exactly wholeness that yeah so
apparently that's the same mistake I
made last time that's an SS
now I mean if fact you could put a fan
there it's up to you as for the hard
drive mounts you just use these rubber
isolation grommets and screws slide them
in here it's pretty much toolless
although you have the option I guess of
installing a screw no probably not yeah
I don't see your favorite okay so there
tool is um all black interior which is a
must these days in my opinion and ample
room for cable management see I can even
like Jam my hand back there should I
should I see fit so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and stay tuned
we're going to show you guys what this
will look like with like a red food
color dulled inside it alright so we did
a quick build
it's not a complete build or anything
like that but we've got a maximus 5
formula in there we've got the Zalman
CMPs 9900 and that's the red LED version
so you can see the red LED fan that
comes on the top the red LED fan that
comes in the back you got a very cool
glowing effect going on inside this
system because it's got like a frosted
or a smoked a smoked side panel you can
see through the top it's about my kind
of a neat sort of you know hellish glow
the front again you've got a bit of a
glow so overall would I say that the red
hf1 Edition is cooler than the regular
as the 11 plus yeah actually it looks
great we've got a fatality 1000 watt
power supply in there so that's why
you've got some additional red glow
coming from the bottom and there's the
it's very quiet - actually it's kind of
surprised at those usually you get those
sort of I mean it's almond so that
should have been my expectation but
usually you get those like performance
Edition parts and they tend to be like
really really loud that's what it looks
like the side panel off looking good
actually
okay so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the Zalman
