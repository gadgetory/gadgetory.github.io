Coolermaster mobile featuring the jazz
pro notebook stand check it out at
mobile cooler master - USA calm so hard
drives aren't really allowed to just be
a hard drive anymore it seems this is
the wireless plus 4c Gaiden yeah it's an
external hard drive and i mean i guess
that yes still makes it a hard drive
comes with a three-year warranty just
like Seagate drives tend to come with
has a fully recyclable package with a QR
code on it so that's very exciting as
well fully recyclable very very cool and
we're just gonna open it up before we
actually tell you anything about the
wireless plus so the first thing that we
can tell you once it's open I could get
it open and I've ruined the package
that's okay is that it's kind of similar
except more advanced to this one that is
the gold flex satellite the go flex
branding has been abandoned but the
concept of taking your media with you
wherever you want to go has not been
abandoned so this is the all new
wireless plus it has a more sort of
modern looking industrial design so
instead of those rounded corners it has
sort of a sharper top and bottom to it
there you go there's holding up the
older drive just for comparison there it
has a bit of a different color scheme
going on to it so it's sort of a a
textured looking grey that looks very
industrial has a bit of a different feel
to it it's not so glossy so it's not
gonna get all finger printing and ugly
as quickly as the older one did the
bottom is soft touch which I love the
bottom of the old one was not soft touch
so soft touch which I love there's your
power in alright there's a friend of the
drive there's the other side of the
drive there's your power button which is
actually located pretty similarly to the
old one in fact it's about power ins in
the same place as well although the plug
is different and then the bottom turn
out here this is the new unit soft touch
feel as well as four little rubber feet
so it's not going to go anywhere and
that's pretty much it for the
physicality of it there's an indicator
for Wireless which brings us to why it's
called the wireless plus as well as
charging and in terms of other
accessories you've got a Quick Start
Guide you've got a nod called go flex
cable apparently anymore but you've
bought one of there
sort of flexible interface cables there
you go so it plugs into the drive like
that the particular one that's included
is USB three although you could plug in
different ones if you wanted to access
it via firewire or SATA or anything else
that might actually matter USB three is
going to be the most important one so it
could even use Thunderbolt if you wanted
it also comes with a USB 2 power adapter
so you don't have to plug it into a
computer just to power it and finally a
wall wart that allows you to not plug it
into a computer just to charge it so
let's talk about what makes it special
it is a wireless Drive so you can store
up to it's a one terabyte drive for this
particular model here so you could store
up to 500 HD videos on it which is kind
of cool so you can take that around with
you has a ten-hour battery life it comes
with Seagate's
own completely upgraded app and the one
for the eye I keep forgetting one it's
called the one for the gold flex
satellite was actually not bad but the
wireless plus adds a different form of
UI so it allows you to not only browse
by folder structure but also to browse
with media thumbnails and things like
that it also adds uploading so now you
can backup full-size pictures or videos
or whatever else from your iOS Android
or Kindle Fire device this is not either
of any of those things this is a Windows
device but there you go so you can
instead of you know being forced to
downsample something when you email to
yourself you can connect up to three
devices to it at a time streaming in HD
or up to eight devices at a time if
you're just looking at photos or or
browsing it or doing whatever else it is
airplay compatible which I personally
think is one of the coolest things about
it because if you have an Apple TV or
whatever else you can actually beam
thing x' to your big screen using this
little guy and it is DLNA compliant as
well so we're actually going to have
some more coverage of this on the tech
quickie Channel upcoming where we sort
of dive into a bit more in depth but I
think that pretty much wraps up for
unboxing thank you for checking out this

plus from Seagate don't forget to
