ground yeah yeah yeah no doubt no doubt
dude uh-uh I'm what you want
hey gran 17th LG gram 17 the world's
lightest laptop now with the 17 inch
display that's a gram
that's a grab dude okay thanks I guess
yeah no doubt yeah cool cool cool
like I didn't pay me but you know who
did our sponsor for today's episode Mack
Weldon Mack Weldon silver line of
underwear t-shirts and socks are
naturally antimicrobial which means you
won't smell quite so bad that's great
news offer code text when t at the link
below to get 20% off as with every gram
notebook ii you pick up the LG gram 17
for the first time it is shocking how
light it feels like it's gram cousins it
ends up feeling a little like those
plastic device replicas that they have
in retail stores so that they're real
ones don't get stolen now with that said
this gram is much bigger than the
previous ones at 17 inches and tips the
scales at two point nine five pounds for
about 1.3 kilograms so they're really
pushing the limits of the Grand category
here but it's still closer to one than
it is to two kilograms and regardless of
the numbers most of the big screen
laptops that we deal with are gaming
machines so being able to carry around a
notebook this size without having to
remember Nick V's lifting tips it's just
great unfortunately one of the things
that comes along with lightness in a
machine this large is some loss of the
stiffness and the sturdiness that we
were so impressed by on the most recent
13-inch Graham now to be clear it's
still made out of the same metal alloys
nano carbon with magnesium which sounds
really fancy and high-tech but it feels
a lot like plastic and that means it's
still pretty fingerprint resistant and
durable enough from my experience daily
driving previous grams but the display
in particular is definitely wobblier
than I'd like and like
if you press on it in certain spots it
kind of feels hollow which I guess makes
sense since it does have hollow spots to
save on weight
design-wise the gram 17 is still great
if you like your notebooks plain and
gray but to be clear I'm not knocking
that it's clean looking so it'll
perfectly match your boring briefcase
and it's highly functional while the
webcam still kind of sucks the i/o is a
great mix including full-sized HDMI and
Thunderbolt free with charging support
there's a fingerprint sensor in the
power button you get a full if slightly
squished number pad and the super thin
bezels frame what is in my mind the most
potent feature of the gram 17 it's
utterly massive display well what can I
say about this it doesn't have HDR just
sort of a drag and touch support is gone
unfortunately but it's still got great
color accuracy and viewing angles thanks
to its IPS panel and the resolution has
been boosted from 1080p to 2560 by 1600
which yes is a sixteen by ten aspect
ratio for those of you keeping score at
home this gives both professionals and
creatives a little extra real estate to
work with and while the pixel density is
a bit lower than some other high end
laptops in my opinion 4k screens on
portable devices are mostly wasted
anyway everything from a premiere time
line to an Excel spreadsheet looked nice
and crisp
not to mention big on the gram 17s
display on the subject of premiere
internally the gram 17 is a little more
ultra than LG's previous ultrabooks
the processor got bumped up to an Intel
Core i7 85 65 you with four cores and
eight threads running at 1.8 gigahertz
which means that combined with its 16
gigs of DDR for memory and 512 gig and
the 2 SATA SSD this machine packs way
beefier guts than its weight would seem
to indicate easily powering through
regular office use and even holding its
own for photo and light video editing
now one of the three
18 inches main strengths in fact it's
the feature we liked most in our review
last year is its battery life so then
how does the larger display and faster
processor affect things on the 17-inch
well the last time I checked eight is
not equal to or greater than ten so
there was definitely an impact but
honestly that's still a really solid
result and other features that continue
to rock on mcgrann include the keyboard
with a nice tactile feel and despite the
short travel distance and the trackpad
which is quite good even if there's
still room to make it bigger opening up
the bottom by removing the rubber feet
and these annoying little plastic
sticker things we find the reason for
the reduction in battery life this seems
to be the same 72 watt hour battery as
the 15-inch we wouldn't have minded
seeing that bumped up a little bit in
here we've also got an extra m2 slot for
expansion and then that's about it
you think LG might have added another
Ram slot larger speakers or even more
cooling to fill out the extra space a
bit but then again I guess if it ain't
broke you don't fix it and the Graham
neither thermal throttled nor got loud
throughout our testing so should you
upgrade to the latest and largest Graham
well for the same price as this thing or
even less actually you could make any
number of compromises on internal specs
build quality and most of all wait if
you were to go with something else but
the fact remains that this notebook is
the lightest and most portable 17 inch
are ever so for people who take their
laptop anywhere and everywhere it's a
winner as long as that anywhere isn't an
alley fight it won't make much of a
makeshift self-defense weapon
