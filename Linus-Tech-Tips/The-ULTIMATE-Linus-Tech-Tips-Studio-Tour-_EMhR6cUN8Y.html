notebook and it adds a four port USB hub
click now to learn more so you guys have
been asking me for a studio tour since
forever ago I'm finally doing it this is
the Linus Media Group studio this is
behind the scenes this is where all of
the videos we make times gonna say we're
all your favorite videos except they're
probably not your favorites but this is
where all the videos we make are made so
this is the storage rack this is where
the queue of upcoming content kind of
sits as well as stuff that we haven't or
that we have already done so this is
here this thing keeps getting opened
this is the Lummi I'm pretty sure it's
tarin who keeps opening it because he's
all like book of spells like going all
LARP on it and I'm just like no that's
not what it's for it's a lamp not alarm
anyway this is a rubber mallet that we
used to recently assemble all these
shelves this is where I store my
personal crap that I don't have room for
at my house because that's what being a
boss is all about yeah yeah exactly
right so this is the regular unboxing
set so you guys normally see it from
this angle so why don't we why we do it
from the other angle instead right so
this is our special table that's
actually called a vert desk we we told
vert desk
they sent us not only this one which
they sent us quite some time ago but
they sent us another one if we promise
to explain how we use it for shooting
this makes our lives so much easier
because instead of adjusting a tripod or
adjusting a slider which I think
Brandon's actually setting up right now
you know where it's like undo this
stupid thing and then undo this other
stupid ridiculous thing they are stupid
compared to the vert disc so now we have
vert dust instead so we used to be like
oh yeah okay we need to slightly adjust
the height depending on the size of the
product or the size of the host for
example and
boom down they hold like 300 pounds over
here is some some more pending stuff so
this is stuff that I'm expecting to have
to deal with pretty much immediately
stuff like Corsairs upcoming TX 1500 a
video and like oh yeah pretty stoked on
this one
this is WS c 97 board all about dem WS
boards this is my car bitch can that I
made out of a cardboard box these are
our fancy lights that we've actually had
for a long time this is the Brandon
shelf so Howard's up there and then
things like his extra cameras that he
insists that we have just in case he
needs them not actually it's for like
commercial shoots and stuff this is a
Blackmagic Cinema Camera so I know it's
funny I've lost all perspective for how
much things cost I would have looked at
a Blackmagic Cinema Camera back when we
started this whole enterprise and gone
holy balls that's way too expensive and
then now with how expensive all the
other production equipment we have is I
just kind of go okay that's like an
extra camera here so okay so to put this
in perspective this is our main camera
rig so this is a Sony fs700 which is
about a seven and a half thousand dollar
camera now I think this lens is another
800 or so that's some Tamron thing that
Brandon has a hard-on for he owns one
himself and still insisted that I buy
one so he could use it this is a
convergent design odyssey 7q so this
will allow us to record 4k ProRes or
even 4k raw in the future but right now
we're able to record 4k but downsampled
to 1080p pro res so that's the improved
sharpness that you've seen in our videos
over the last little while it's a few
grand for one of those including the
proprietary SSDs that go on it says just
all this stuff is like so unbelievably
expensive but like you guys just have no
idea what it takes to make like really
high quality videos well I guess you do
now because you're watching this is our
green screen so this is where we shoot
fast as possible it used to be on like a
self-constructed
white wall that I built in my garage but
we found an actual green screen is much
more effective these lights are our old
lights so we just use them to illuminate
the green screen they actually have
these check out these like janky plastic
color chip well whatever they're in
their blood janky plastic color
change your things in there I want to
get new lights and I want to have them
ceiling mounted so the idea will be that
you wire them all up to one switch just
kind of go boom and then we're ready to
shoot as fast as possible because the
amount of time that we waste dinking
around with getting the lights
positioned and then fixing it in
post-production is just not worth it
here's where the storm trooper lives
until I get around to dressing up the
mannequin and then this is the
networking hub which I probably
shouldn't even show anyone because of
how brutal it is so here's the fiber box
here's the cable box here's like all the
routers that we were using to diagnose
on here if we were going to build a PSS
machine with this but then we just we
just bailed so there you go this is what
we use for our voiceovers so I've
actually done an unboxing of this this
is the editors Keys SL 300 mic and then
the little vocal studio booth thing is
absolutely fantastic over in the kitchen
here Brandon is you I guess you're
you're seeing what the process is for
b-roll so you know a lot of work goes
into getting things all you know set up
and shot it's funny if you come over
here behind you can see that things
aren't quite as tidy as they it first
appeared to be so here's like saw Slade
and gaff tape and Brandon's like you
know panini maker because like whatever
that's the thing normal people bring to
work and then I keep telling people
please do why are there dishes in the
sink if you have dishes at work you
clean them and you take them home but
for some reason we end up with dishes
here I don't quite understand it back
here we've got all the stuff for a build
guide that we're working on filming
right in here this is the cardboard pile
there's actually a real problem around
here is what to do with all of the
cardboard that things come shipped in
like we don't know how to address this
problem because we don't exactly have
like a commercial size dumpster out in
the back yard or anything I think that's
mostly it for the for the oh yes right
the bathroom and here it is the most
frustrating room in the entire building
because I'm the only one who cleans it
and as you can tell it's not like that
often and people just do the most the
most sort of strange things like why do
people put toilet paper in a
and that is literally right next to a
toilet where they would have the
opportunity to flush it instead of me
having to deal with it well they should
blow their nose and put it in there yes
yes well anyway the point of this is
Dollar Shave Club our sponsor for this
video Dollar Shave Club ships you
high-quality razors handles and other
bathroom supplies directly to your door
to save you the hassle and money
involved with going to the store
fighting with someone to go and unlock
the safe to pull out some more razors
and then waiting in line or going
through the self checkout which if
you've ever gone to the one at Home
Depot it never actually works like have
you ever successfully made it through
the self checkout at Home Depot I swear
you scan one thing and it's like boot
please wait for attendant anyway Home
Depot self checkout aside Dollar Shave
Club razors are high-quality and cost a
fraction as much as the ones that you
buy at the store because they don't
include any of the unnecessary BS frills
and gimmicks that those ones do like
vibrating handles that have actually
been demonstrated to not actually do
anything in any way they can actually be
proven they are available in the United
States Canada and Australia and for an
under ten dollars a month you can even
get their executive deluxe six blade
razor shipped to you at once every month
so that you're gonna have a fresh blade
one for every week of the month so you
don't have to choose between the options
of dragging a rusty nail across your
face like he was doing before we got
some taller shave club supplies way to
go man or you know fighting with traffic
to go and get some razors when you just
want to get a nice clean shave they've
also got other products as well
including dr. Carver's easy shave butter
which goes on clear so you can actually
see what you're doing softens up the
hair just basically does what it's
supposed to do and smells nice which I
consider to be an excellent bonus and
another thing that also smells nice and
has additional functionality is one wide
charli's you can see where these were
positioned in the bathroom right next to
the toilet which should give you some
idea what
one wipe Charlies are used for punishing
employees actually for wiping your butt
anyway let's continue with our tour and
head on upstairs thank you to Dollar
Shave Club for sponsoring this video on
Linus tech tips guys head over to
dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus and join
the club if you want to start saving
your time and saving your money actually
we missed a couple things on the stairs
here that's the water cooling supplies
for an upcoming build guide there's a
Quadro for some reason and actually not
sure why that's there there I don't know
what those are alright so up here is the
legendary okay so here's the stuff from
last week's garage sale that I'm gonna
ship out this is the executive bathroom
that no one uses because no one here is
an executive I believe in a very flat
you know organizational structure this
is the water cooling closet so this is
the this is the container that we use
for spraying gaudy employee I mean this
is the container we used for filling up
reservoirs and stuff like sorry it was
tempting I don't know how long that
wires been in there we've got a whole
whack ton of radiators up here so many
that this thing is actually flexing
here's the tubing bucket so we got all
the tubing and the crabs in that bucket
then we've also got fittings a bunch of
like really old water cooling crap from
like my house more radiators more like
random widgets and like blocks and pumps
and stuff and then down here is all the
supplies from my old chiller so this
could be used to make a subzero cooler
you can get a CPU down to around minus
25 or so with that but you got to
actually put it together and then the
when showroom so actually this oh that's
how it's gonna be alright I guess I
deserved that
so this room I have already set up my
whole system with the one button Boop
and the wind show room is lit just like
that so easy also in the wind show room
is our steel series set so this is where
we shoot our steel series tech tech
quickie videos and then over here is the
random pile of stuff that has gradually
reduced in size I mean some of its like
collapsed like if you look back here
I don't even know what's up with some of
this stuff like there's toilet paper
rolls back here probably because I
switched to one wipe Charlies there's
also like you know guns and stuff you
know these are just BB guns by the way
they're not actually they're not
actually weapons so don't worry too much
about it uh let's see what else we got
in here this is the CRT that we used to
play games on the after party on back
when we had one of those and then that's
another Blackmagic Cinema Camera so
that's why the land show went from
looking like kind of poop to looking
freakin pretty good and then the
lighting was what made a big difference
in terms of the consistency of the show
because I would look at the thumbnails
and I'd be like okay it looks good and
it looks good but they're completely
different types of goods so this is our
sound setup that unfortunately no one
here other than Ed zhilie knows how to
use so this is a compressor this is a
mixer and then the problem is that we
don't have the cables to something
anyway that's why it's always quiet but
that's also why when I talk really loud
it doesn't just peek immediately a clip
or whichever one is the one for sound
not video this is the wardrobe closet so
this is where a slender man lives until
I dress them in his stormtrooper armor
this is a Gil's outfit from the funk
commercials here's our ninja suits from
that be quiet commercial here's a NCIX
pc t-shirt for some reason I don't know
man
I'm not sure what to say and then this
is where most of the real work gets done
so our team members in order of
appearance are Ed's leagoo Brandon Lee
Taryn van Hebert and then finally
someone you've never met before this is
mr. Nick light so he is the one who was
responsible for that recent fast as
possible that had no ad integration on
it this is our sales and advertising
coordinator whereas Taryn does some
script writing some producing some video
editing and even some on screen hosting
Brandon you guys and Ed's Lee you guys
are probably mostly familiar with but
they specialize in filming editing Edie
actually doesn't do much filming anymore
I'm not even sure if he still remembers
how to
use a camera but he does most of our
color sound and post-production work and
all that good stuff and then I'm not
sure what I do around here this is the
old gear closet which has now because
Nick's desk is in the way of it has been
turned into kind of long-term storage so
boxes for things that we might need to
return at some point if it's you know
broken or whatever my monitor that I
really want to switch back to this is
that LG twenty one by nine monitor but
I'm reviewing a monitor right now that's
on my desk so I need to like deal with
that actually here I guess I might as
well show you guys my desk while I'm at
it so this is my office with a window
you know got my window here I share the
window mind you but I share the office
too but whatever is my computer that has
no side panel as some people observed in
a picture I took a little while ago this
is a BenQ 32 inch 2560 by 1440 monitor
that I'm taking for a test drive right
now this is my water bottle this is huh
this is kind of funny this is the random
raid card and 10 gig Ethernet or not
Ethernet LAN card that I've had on my
desk I don't really know what to do with
for a while it's like funny this is my
phone stand check it out it's from
Coolermaster Boop Luke thinks they're
stupid but I disagree because now I can
see my notifications without even
without even glancing at my SmartWatch
before I glanced at my SmartWatch I can
see things this I probably don't even
want to show you guys but this is sort
of the server room I guess it's also
sort of a bathroom no one is allowed to
use this bathroom so I can walk you guys
through a little bit of how the workflow
goes in here so we have our scanner and
printer we have storage that goes in the
bathtub this is our fireproof nass down
here that I haven't actually deployed
but I should probably do something with
at some point this is our archive so
this is where anything that's no longer
being stored on the raid array and the
NASS goes on WD sorry
yeah very safe following all the best
practices it's like there's it do as I
say not as I do this room no-one should
do any nor my favorite part is like this
the waters on I'm not going to turn it
yeah but like I should turn it he didn't
cut the water to No
both the toilet and the sink actually
work right now so like if something
bumps the faucet
well you shouldn't bump that I should be
the only one allowed in this room anyway
also he thinks that is a proper way to
archive drives I don't look at this
operate look at this not proper I know
it isn't proper the point is that's
where they are no one touch them okay so
here's our switch this is mostly gigabit
but also 10 gigabit so there's a 10
gigabit link to our server that also
runs to Ed's oisin since he's the one
who Beck when we set this up who was
doing most of the very high bitrate
content editing this is our net gear
storage appliance that we use as a nice
cozy drive so that Luke can install all
of his games on a network drive whenever
he's benchmarking rather than install
them locally and have to reimage those
all the time down here is the main
server so this is running a Xeon
processor with some Intel board that has
Thunderbolt we are using a
consumer-grade board so that we can use
Thunderbolt for ingesting footage
it's got like 10 or 11 drives in it that
are running in a raid 6 right now so
those are all three terabyte drives now
that we're shooting ProRes I'm having to
archive things a lot more often and it's
getting kind of crazy in terms of our
storage needs we're going to need to
redress this sometime soon whether it's
with FreeNAS or another solution but for
the time being that's how everything
runs we copy footage off of it here's
those proprietary SSDs I was talking to
you guys about these things are so
expensive like unbelievable so we use
this Thunderbolt dock right here for
copying very very large files and then
we have this one right here for copying
anything that's like moving moving
archival footage onto greens for example
or just if the funderbolt dock is in use
for whatever reason now let's move over
into Luke's area so this is where most
of the benchmarking happens there's the
closet here which is overflow storage
for things like the copious amounts of
RAM hey there's your stick no it's just
one the other two are in this system and
you missed an opportunity I said there's
your stick and you didn't know sue me
for harassment so this is a recent
addition
finally got a nice rack for where most
of the storage is done it used to be
kind of all over the floor but things
are much much tidier now it's kind of
easier for everyone to work lately so
this is where all the graphics cards or
anything that he's about to be working
on go this is for an upcoming case
review I know we're a little late on the
2:30 tee from Coursera but we're finally
getting around to it now so Luke just
did the build on that I got a script it
still and we're probably gonna film that
a little bit later this is where the
test benches go we've actually got oh
you put the new leg in so this is fine
no it's not okay no because it has
different screws the new leg in it has
different springs
that's a problem anyway oh it doesn't
matter you just they're not threaded you
just I know I know oh well at any rate
ah so this is so here you should go back
so that they can see the curve of this
table like the bowing that's going on
with this table so we finally got a
fifth leg to kind of prop up the middle
of it and then we want to get a thing
down here that's actually going to be
built on this piece of wood so that we
can so we can put the test benches down
here and free up some more space on the
top so there's lots more things to
continue to do which I guess leads us to
the overflow storage where we have
things like city combs what do you know
about this why do you talk cable tie I
have no idea no no anyway so like Leafs
for like a table that's here because I
don't have room for it at my house the
couch master because that's where I
think most bulky stuff like this that
people buy on an impulse and then can't
figure out where to put ends up and then
this most of these boxes are actually
empty so there you go read into that
whatever you will but this is where all
the cases or the boxes for cases that we
don't know like that we have deployed
but we still want to have the boxes just
in case our and like this mini-fridge
and that table that's hiding under a
bunch of the boxes so this is where all
the overflow storage is and I think
that's pretty much it thank you for
coming along for our little into
active tour of the Linus media group
studio I hope you guys enjoyed it like
the video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it share it if you know
someone who also cares about what goes
on behind the scenes over here and then
