an outright swinging abyss either their
creators underestimate the difficulty of
their task they make too many
compromises in pursuit of a singular
design goal or in the case of this
rolling projector their idea was just
terrible and something that nobody could
possibly want to begin with in the case
of the Helios 500 from Acer well it's
actually kind of the opposite problem
they actually created something awesome
here but then they totally whiffed on
who might want to buy it since it's
dressed for a land party with a skill
set that's better suited for the kind of
place you'd typically wear a suit that's
right
you'd never know it from its appearance
but you are looking at the best laptop
for content creators that we've ever
seen and we're gonna explain what makes
it so great after the best sponsor segue
you've ever seen blasts wire allows you
to instantly see your current and past
network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device

let's cut right to the chase here
the eight core rise in seven 2700 CPU
that's at the heart of the Helios 500 is
the fastest processor we have ever seen
in a laptop without tweaking anything we
were able to get a score of 1547 in
Cinebench and to put that number in
context the only laptop we've ever seen
go faster was the Asus G 703 G at 1569
and that was with liquid metal on it and
one of the most ghetto cooling solutions
that even we have ever attempted I mean
it wasn't usable like that by contrast
with just a touch of overclocking the
Helios 500 was able to do 3.9 gigahertz
on all cores at one point 4 volts meting
it a laptop record-shattering 1730 in
Cinebench these are full blown desktop
numbers like if you took the new six
core razor blade and the four core razor
blade stealth that I use as my daily
driver and and somehow combined them
there ten processing cores still
wouldn't be as fast as the Helios 500
and it's equipped with a Vega 56 GPU
that's the same one that ships by
default in Apple's $5,000 iMac pro
workstation so this means but if you
wanted to roll in somewhere park your
car and do some hardcore video editing
or rendering or engineering work in the
parking lot this is currently the
fastest productivity laptop on the
market and somehow it manages to do that
while staying relatively cool and even
quiet and it doesn't just perform well
for content creators either
thanks to that Vega 56 GPU I mentioned
before the Helios 500 has some pretty
mean gaming chops as well now it'll get
handily but whopped by anything equipped
with a gtx 1080 but it beat the gtx 1070
max-q
in all of our tests by a comfortable
margin and made excellent use of its 144
Hertz freesync display delivering smooth
frame rates that were regularly well
of the 60 FPS threshold making matters
even better the screen is IPS has great
colors an awesome response time and
solid brightness too for a gaming
display for content creators were given
it a B+ and suggesting that a certain
factory calibrate it to improve matters
here though
maybe the 4k 60 Hertz option is better
in this regard so this is all very
positive so far isn't it and you're
probably waiting for the other shoe to
drop
well that's true around here somewhere
ah yes wait no longer because for any
laptop size performance or noise has to
be sacrificed and here Acer clearly
sacrificed size it's sturdy and it packs
some great speakers but at over 11
pounds with the power brick the Helios
500 as an everyday carry makes about as
much sense as an RPG launcher as it
everyday carry you could but ask your
buddy in the force if you should lots of
space though does mean lots of upgrade
potential two screws reveal two
completely free sodium slots a free m2
slot and a two and a half inch drive bay
with the mounting hardware included in
the box if you want to go deeper 32 more
screws gets you the subwoofer drives
battery fans and heatsink after which
you'll be greeted by the real stars of
the show the Vega 56 GPU with its high
bandwidth memory proudly on display and
the reason that this thing is so darn
thick the Rison 7 2700 in a desktop CPU
socket so the performance is great but
there are plenty of other ways to goof
up a laptop let's start with the
trackpad shall we it's not great it's
small there's some really funky
acceleration going on and the way that
it's recessed into the chassis maybe
this is to help with its mediocre palm
rejection can make it pretty difficult
to use now I personal
generally to hand my trackpads so I
didn't even notice it I on the other
hand don't use my other hand so when I'm
trying to click I have to kind of move
my hand so that my thumb can get down
between and I just can't click
accurately while I'm doing that there
really need to improve it for the next
version moving up from there the
keyboard feels very similar to the one
in the Eastern I trow five and it was
fine there long keystroke and some
tactile feedback but mushy at the bottom
and not terribly satisfying to use but
the issue here is that the Helios 500
costs over twice as much so I think
there's room for improvement which I
guess brings us perfectly to the price
starting at $2,200 the Helios 500 with
the risin 7 processor is $200 more than
a similarly kid at asu's efforts and
about the same as a razor blade 20 18
and while in rendering the Helios does
destroy both of them if you're mostly
looking to game it's really hard to
recommend like the blade performs close
enough in games has doubled the battery
life and still manages to be a perfectly
competent work computer on top of being
half the weight and therefore much more
pleasant to carry around the Helios by
contrast is most at home on your desk in
your home which is why we think that a
Tsar screwed up when they marketed the
Helios 500 for gamers instead of trying
to compete with the zephyrus blade and
many other much more practical gaming
laptops we think they should have
doubled down on it as a mobile
workstation including a calibrated
screen an option for ECC Ram more subtle
styling and some professional features
and a much better webcam with all those
changes Acer would be looking at a
recommendation to buy as it stands right
now they're looking at a recommendation
to admire it from afar because it's not
a bad machine it's just a little weird
speaking of weird if we were to ever do
a good segue sound Kors Liberty light
earphones are so small light you'll
forget that you are
barring them they use graphene enhanced
drivers to provide exceptional sound
clarity with deep resonating bass they
use an LDS antenna to keep you connected
via bluetooth at up to 33 feet they
offer three and a half hours of play
time from a single charge and the
carrying case doubles as a charger that
offers an additional nine hours of
battery life their IP x5 rated meaning
that they are protected from water and
sweat and you guys can check them out at
the link in the video description not
only to buy them but even for a chance
to win these earphones or other sound
court products go check it out so thanks
for watching guys if you disliked this
video you can hit that button
let's light that but you know what that
would be great if YouTube replaced their
look like a raspberry like a sticking
out tongue if you liked it though hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description mostly if you're a
workstation user or a hardcore AMD
fanboy please also while you're down
