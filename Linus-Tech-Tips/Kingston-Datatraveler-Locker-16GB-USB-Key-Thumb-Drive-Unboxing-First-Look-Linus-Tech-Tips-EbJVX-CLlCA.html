unboxing of the Kingston DataTraveler
Locker plus this is a 100% encrypted
that means no public zone hardware-based
data encryption USB key here on the back
you can see there are some more
specifications USB 2.0 compliant some of
the listed capacities used for
formatting another function that is not
available for storage for more
information go to Kingston flash memory
guide at Kingston comm slash about flash
underscore memory underscore guide so
I'm gonna go ahead this packaging open
as we have a lot of USB keys I mean the
things that you really care about are
how much storage it has you know that's
the reason that's the price scales
directly with storage what it looks like
because believe it or not like you know
Penda shaped USB keys and all kinds of
other things and I mean really I keep my
USB key on my on my keychain so I can
totally understand why people would care
about the overall look of it features
like being topless so you can see right
here the data traveler Locker plus is
entirely capless so that means that all
you do is flip it out in order to plug
it into something and then you just flip
it back around to protect the USB
interface here you can actually run a
little string you know one of those
little things that you can use to hang
stuff off your phone or a little string
like a little camera holder run one of
those through there and you can use that
to attach it to whatever it is that you
want to attach it to we've got a little
Kingston logo here with their little guy
I can't quite figure out who that guy is
supposed to be you know what please
leave a comment on this video and tell
me who you think this guy is and the
best answer wins ok in here let's see if
you've got some more information i've
actually got a few of these to give away
oh hey there we go it even comes with
that so it's got a little keychain on it
and then a little string to loop through
the casing so that you can carry around
your dad traveller 16-week so I have a
few of these to give away so the answer
that I like the most in the next week or
two or however long it takes me to give
this away will receive a data traveller
Locker 16 gig and I'm also opening up
one of them to Esther NCIX Esther on
Facebook so just search for NCIX
Wester she's over there I caught her on
her way out of the office and I told you
that she can give one of these away on
Facebook as well so I have no idea what
the terms of that are going to be so you
should check out the NCIX Facebook page
and figure out how exactly that's going
to work don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips and thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the data
traveller Locker plus which is a safe
way to store your data on the go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
