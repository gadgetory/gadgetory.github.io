something pretty cool today from Intel
it's not a new product but it is a new
software application that they've just
released it is a Windows gadget which
basically means it's a little
application that runs either in the
windows sidebar which is over here on
the right of side of the cameras reach
that's in Windows Vista or on windows 7
you can actually move them around
wherever you want so it's the Intel
turbo boost gadgets you can see right
here
this is an Intel Core i7 Xtreme 965
processor 3.2 gigahertz there's nothing
in the turbo boost bar right now
now our CPU temperatures are around 50
degrees which is a very comfortable CPU
temperature maybe a little high for the
CPU but we're going to go create an
artificial workload and I'm going to
show you what the turbo boost gadget
does so here is the workload we've
created a 1 thread so that means it is a
CPU workload that only takes advantage
of one CPU out of this quad core so
something like a game or an older
application might only make use of a
single thread now we're going to run it
on CPU 1 which is what a single threaded
application would typically run on here
we go now if you just cruise right on
over here you can see that poor 0 to the
left to the left everything you own in a
box to the most yea core 0 right there
is running at 70 degrees and all the
other cores are much cooler that's
because this is a single threaded
application now if you go over to the
turbo boost widget that is all sorry
it's a gadget-gadget not a widget it is
3.47 gigahertz now and the blue bar is
all the way to the top so that's a 3.2
gigahertz processor all the way up to
3.4 7 gigahertz now if I change my
workload so if I run a 4 threaded
workload and if I change it around so
that I assign it to any CPU it wants to
be on it if I click the right thing it
goes a lot better
okay so CPU affinity run on any CPU
torture test and run we can go back over
to my core temp monitoring you can see
that all CPUs are now being stressed and
turbo boost only goes up to three point
three three gigahertz that's because
it's over
clocking all four course now this is an
older i7 CPU and the newer i5 and i7 is
on socket 1156 actually have better
turbo boost that can provide up to a
twenty percent performance improvement
according to the hardware connects
review on these CPUs
so this one that goes up a couple of
speed bins one for our multi-threaded
application and to speed bins for a
single threaded application whereas the
i7 860 and 870 can go up to five speed
bins for a single threaded application
with the i5 750 going up for speed bim's
for a single threaded application so
thank you for checking out my - tech

gadget widget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
