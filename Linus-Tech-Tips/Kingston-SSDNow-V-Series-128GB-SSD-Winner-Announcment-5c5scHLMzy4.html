milestone so in response to give away
the SSD hahaha from all for fun 3 4 5 as
well as all the other guys who r minus
if you don't give away the SSD the
second we will eat your cats come on
it's 25,000 congratulations for 25,000
yes we are finally there so i am going
to give away a kingston 128 gig SSD no v
plus SSD drive so what I have done
because the requirement was you had to
leave a comment under the videos I've
copy/pasted all the comments into an
excel sheet and I'm going to generate a
random number between one and eighteen
thousand five so it's probably going to
take a few shots to actually come up
with a name and something to be aware of
is if you've come into multiple times
like falou bi here then yeah you can't
really qualify because it should be
pretty much common sense that is one
entry per person okay so here we go oh
that's not how it works hold on exactly
a sec yes it appears I forgot how to use
that function so here we go I'm going to
press ENTER and oh for crying out loud
equal sign hopefully that is the secret
yes there we go okay 14,000 974 so why
don't we scroll hold on i'm just going
to use this is a cool feature on the g9
mouse by the way you just press this
button on the bottom and then you can
just freewheel scroll so i can scroll
quite quickly now I forget the number so
we'll go back down
ok it was fourteen thousand nine hundred
seventy-four come on fourteen thousand
974 so let's see if that's a name two
thousand is not a name ok let's do have
the draw so we calculate no hold on I
have to oh I don't have to take it again
that sucks all right here we go control
so 8634 this might take a little while I
apologize for the suspense I guess you
can always skip forward the video if you
don't want to wait anymore 8674 keep
going keep scrolling 8674 all right
where are you not a name ok so will
control paste again 13,000 119 here yo
13,000 119 Oh is one month ago control
the 2505 2505 is very close to here 2506
4505 aha such a comic so ctrl f such a
comic ok
you
hmm I'll be back in a moment once I
figure out what all of this means okay
so it's just the formatting of the way
that the copy paste works such a comment
only made comic comment such a comic
only made one comment saying whoa this
guy should get it and he did so there
you have it our draw came up with the
random number 2505 and such a comic is
the big winner please contact me via my
youtube channel p.m. for your SSD thank
you everyone for playing and we are
going to have more giveaways shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
