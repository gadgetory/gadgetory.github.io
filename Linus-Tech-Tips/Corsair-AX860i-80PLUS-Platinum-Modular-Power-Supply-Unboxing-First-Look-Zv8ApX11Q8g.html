the Corsair ax iSeries ax 860 I so I had
the funniest conversation with the
Russian the other day and he was asking
me if he could borrow my H 100 I and I
was like Oh what do you need it for and
he's like oh well we got to do like a
system build video and you know blah
blah blah our shipment of Isis is is
late so I need to borrow one and I'm
like oh well how do you see then and he
kind of stared at me for
must've been must have been a good like
30 seconds like like not even
exaggerating like 30 seconds he just
kind of stared at me and I was like wait
for it wait for it and then he never
actually got it so that was what led me
to believe that actually that joke
probably wasn't very good so here we go
we've got a power supply that's part of
the ax I series this we've already
looked at the 1200 eye which we threw
out of a moving vehicle if you want to
check out that unboxing it was kind of
fun and this one we're not going to do
the same thing but this is the first
video we're doing in our new unboxing
set which has been worked on very hard
by yours truly so what does the ax I
series bring to the table that the ax
series did not so number one is full
integration with Corsair link so Corsair
link is their hardware kit that they
have produced for controlling and
monitoring all kinds of cool things
about your systems so if you load up to
the nines with Corsair components
including you know memory and coolers
you can monitor all kinds of crazy stuff
like the voltages on your power supply
the coolant temperature of your coolers
your your fan RPMs you can control all
kinds of cool stuff so Corsair link is
pretty freakin sweet
another thing that ax eye upgrades over
the previous generation product is it
upgrades from 80 plus gold certification
for efficiency to 80 plus platinum so
that means it's basically 90 plus if you
have a look at the curve here even at
115 volts that's 90% efficiency does not
dip below 80 + Platinum is as high as it
gets right now for any kind of consume
level power supply they've also you're
they're using a digital signal processor
for tighter voltage regulation and lower
electrical ripple and noise which
improves overall system stability and
component reliability and they're
guaranteeing this thing for seven years
which is basically like saying it's not
going to die I mean think about the kind
of computer you were running seven years
ago that was 2005 at the time of filming
this video so in 2005 I mean a 600 700
watt power supply was a lot and the
standards for connecting them to things
were completely different so like
they're basically saying for the useful
life of this component it will not die
warranty guide to download the link
software for the courser link dashboard
to monitor cool stuff so remember guys
you don't need the courser link hardware
in order to take advantage of some of
the aspects of link and I'll show you
the pieces that it comes with but if you
do get the kit then obviously it gives
you a more integrated overall experience
of course sir I've been doing this since
pretty much day one of their power
supply business back when they had only
the the HX 520 and HX 620 I had myself a
520 slick had a 620 in his oil cooled
machine I think he still has it is still
working not still working those are old
power supplies now no wonder Corsair
doesn't mind warranting the thing for
seven years
all right included accessories we got
empowered by Corsair badge we've got
four screws for mounting it to your case
and a whole wacked load of black zip
ties for cable managing that combined
with you know what they usually provide
what their cases means you should have
pretty much everything you need to cable
manage your system if you go with a
Corsair power supply and of course our
case open up the velvet package here
find out what's inside you know at least
it's not the at least it's not the 70s
anymore so we don't have to worry about
finding anything bad inside a velvet
package I mean velvet huh alright so the
power supply itself this is a short
power supply unlike the 1200 I which is
quite long and this so this will have
just complete compatibility with pretty
much any case that accepts an ATX power
supply it's got a 120 millimeter cooling
fan it should be noted however that that
120 millimeter fan only actually turns
on dent in it that
at 20% load so when your system is idle
that is to say that it's consuming less
than about 175 to 200 225 whatever the
math is once from the wall so less than
about a quarter of its capacity from the
wall and 90% 95% of systems out there
will be below that at idle your fan will
turn off which mean you won't have to
listen to your power supply until you
actually turn on a game or some other
kind of intensive application that's
awesome because it means that when your
computers not doing anything you don't
have to listen to it doing stuff because
it's not doing anything
fans turn off awesome love to see that
they've got specs on the side here so
because of you know the digital nests of
it and all of that good stuff you can
see it's capable of delivering the full
71 point 6 amps or 850 9.2 watts on the
12 volt rail so it's using its using
converters actually excusing voltage
step-down components inside in order to
actually achieve the 5 volt and 3.3
volts that it needs for other components
inside your system here is the core Sara
Lee
okay assuming we can open this give me a
sec guys and we figured it out so this
guy right here plugs into the power
supply through a custom lead and then
plugs into a USB header on your board
and it should communicate with other
Corsair link components as well so
that's how the whole corsair link thing
works it actually interfaces directly
with the hardware in your system through
a software interface in the OS to allow
you to control all kinds of cool stuff
and I mean hey it's about time the power
supply started getting a little bit
smarter so let's go ahead and hold on
where is the thing yeah comm port that's
going to be in here somewhere yeah there
she is so this plugs into the comm port
on the back of the power supply exceeds
fully modular even including courser
link you don't have to use it if you
don't want to but that plugs in there
and then that goes into the dongle here
which plugs into USB and is sort of
generally a good thing all right it has
a self-test button which is sort of neat
and a wide variety of different modular
cable connectors so you can plug in up
to four PCIe 6 pins and two CPU eight
pins plus a 24 pin plus six additional
peripheral and SATA K
so let's have a look at what they've
included in terms of modular cables
Corsair has really led the charge in
terms of beautiful cabling so you can
see they're using a very high quality
sleeve here and on top of that you can't
see any color through this leading
because they're using all black wires
for every single cable this should not
be overlooked in terms of how difficult
it is to achieve because power supply
manufacturers don't want to deal with
this they want to have everything color
coded so that it's easy to manufacture
so Corsair is paying extra to bring this
kind of stuff to you guys so I hope you
appreciate it
so there's your 24 pin we've also got
where's my 8 pin 8 pin 8 pin - okay so
that's a 6 plus no way hold on ok so
that's a 6 plus 2 this guy right here
there's your 8 pin let's have a look at
the length of the 8 pin because this is
a big factor if you're using a case that
has a bottom mounted power supply such
as course there's only 800 D that's a
little bit on the short side if you want
to get all the way to the top of an 800
d you might need an extension cable
though there are pretty neat sort of
individually sleeved extension cables
out there so let's go ahead and tuck
that guy aside for now there is ok so
that's a single 6 plus 2 interesting
whereas this is a dual 6 plus 2 yes dual
6 plus 2 which is great if you're
running 2 connectors to a single card
here's another dual 6 plus 2 so that's a
total of 5 so far here's a single 6 plus
2 so that's a total of 6 so far and then
another CPU connector this is a 4 plus 4
so you can break it apart and use it as
a 4 pin should you so desire so that's a
really unique way of doing that so
they've got two harnesses that each have
two and then two more that each have one
giving you the ability to not only run 6
pin PCI II connectors to video cards
because really most people are only
going to be running sort of 4 PCIe
connectors Macs on their video cards in
SLI or crossfire but many components are
starting to use PCIe connectors as
auxilary power even motherboards so
that's why Corsair has included two that
are optimized for graphics card plugging
in and then two that are optimized for
running somewhere else empowering
something else should you so desire so
very cool very smart way of doing that
and it also again gives you the option
to run things like triple PCIe connector
video cards like there's a light
580 that uses three and stuff like that
so great stuff good flexibility that
they are giving you so we've got a four
SATA connector harness we have another
four SATA connector harness we have
another four SATA connector harness and
that is it for the four SATA connector
harnesses so that's a total of 12 SATA
drives that you can plug in natively
plus you remember you can always adapt
molex connectors because quite frankly
who needs eight molex connectors anymore
that would be ridiculous and then
finally to molex to floppy connectors
included just in case you still have
something that actually uses that
archaic standard I think that pretty
much covers it I don't think we've
looked closely enough necessarily at the
end of itself so you got your standard
honeycomb mesh on the back got your
on/off switch you got your I mean course
are so good at this stuff so you've got
your gorgeous sort of labels and
stickers and branding and all that that
looks amazing in your system
everything's right side up no matter
which way you turn it so it's not going
to look stupid which I've seen a number
of times in the past you can plug in
pretty much every connector it comes
with right out of the box actually you
can okay so they have two six plus the
two yep you can plug in everything
should you so desire so while that
doesn't necessarily give you the
flexibility of the approaches I've seen
in the past on some other power supplies
by the time you plug in everything to
this power supply you've got eight
molexes twelve SATA connectors six PCIe
connectors to eight pins under twenty
four pins so you're probably pretty much
at the end of that eight hundred and
sixty watt capacity thank you for
