Dell's ultra short throw laser projector
the s7 18 QL known affectionately around
the office as kylo red then you already
know that it's a badass 4k HDR projector
with insane brightness that works just
about anywhere but what you didn't know
is that we actually have not one not
even two but three kylo ren's and today
we're gonna do something big with them
something big and wide
okay so the first thing we need
aside from projectors is a rig powerful
enough to run three 4k displays in games
at once so what we're using is three
Quadro P five thousand GPUs then we
needed a platform that could not only
support all three of these quad rows but
that would also have space for an
additional expansion card so we're using
an x 99 EWS from a soos a core i7 6900
k-8 core processor with a hundred and
twenty eight gigs of g.skill trident zr
gb ram because why not and then because
our goal isn't to display the same image
from three projectors no no we want to
make one big image we need an nvidia
sync two expansion card this is the same
one from our 16 K gaming build which you
can check out right over there
powering the whole thing we've got a
platter max D F Platinum 1200 watt power
supply with sleeve cables right out of
the box we've got an equal int tempered
glass case although the glasses off
right now so I can put it all this stuff
with high-density soundproofing
insulation in the front top and side
we're using a lick max to 240 millimeter
a IO cooler that can handle up to a 350
watt processor and we're using Lipa
chopper advanced LED fans all courtesy
of enter max who get a big shout out for
sponsoring this video so then yeah we've
got three projectors we've got a PC to
power them now's the big reveal we are
going on a little field trip outside
where we're gonna be creating one
gigantic image on the side of our
neighbors building mm hey I think I
solved the network problem
we had a network cable running over to
the laser cutter so I throw a switch
here I think for I think we're actually
pretty close to the 100 meter limit
though for Ethernet on that subject I
think we've got every extension cord in
the entire building daisy chained
together we've had enough power out here
because we're running three five
thousand lumen projectors projectors
it's called sorry projectors so yeah
they're laser very efficient but still
so there are a number of challenges that
we have to address before we're gonna be
able to game on this number one is that
all these projectors need to be level
off the ground so the innovative
strategy that we've come up with is a
combination of these rocks these rubber
tape it and then we got some printer
paper to kind of do the fine adjustments
at the end problem number two that we
have to solve is that they all have to
be exactly the same distance away from
the wall although what's cool is that
they don't have to be the same distance
away from each other because the Quadro
sync card in our configuration here
allows us to fine tune in videos mosaic
settings on a pixel-by-pixel basis so
that we can get them to butt up right
against each other problem number three
is that each one of them has to be key
stone because we can make all the
pixel-by-pixel adjustments in the world
that we want
but ultimately
at the bottom the mouse movements are
going to be really unnatural problem
number four is that our office is right
next to a train obviously we couldn't do
this inside because we wanted to project
you know like a freaking 80 inch
diagonal screen I just need an 80 foot
80 foot sorry Imperials not my
strongpoint
okay I'm not quite sure how you intended
these runs James one for bean bag maybe
one per feed bag doing me to help you
help make a spot in it for you okay so
we've got them good enough because we're
not gonna stay out here all night
now it's time to make some fine
adjustments so with monitors you bezel
correction to make it so that when
something passes over a bezel you don't
end up with it misaligned like this but
now we want overlap I feel like I'm
giving a presentation or something so
now we're just gonna you know click the
mouse over there it took a lot of
tweaking but once we got it working
it was absolutely freaking sick Rick
James jeez you are actually
like 40 feet from the start menu
right here what's wrong with one of the
things we learned is that just because
it's awesome doesn't mean that it is
actually usable no there no there's
trees in the way
clearly some games operate better in 48
by 9 aspect ratio than others do looks
like system so it turns out that just
because you're using three $2,500
graphics cards that doesn't mean that
you can actually gain at 60fps three
times 4k is a lot of pixels
and enter max for allowing us to come
out here in the middle of the night in
the cold and have utterly unique if not
particularly advantageous queueing
