DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts hey there guys
welcome to my fief benchmarking overview
video we're going to be testing things
today on the standard test bench of 49
60 X clocked at four-point-oh gigahertz
but at 16 gigs of RAM clocked at
eighteen sixty six megahertz and the
variance of GPUs who's overclocking
settings you can find in the GPU
overclocking dock linked below this
video so I broke up the graphics cards
into three tiers there's the extreme
tier with five hundred dollar plus
graphics cards which is running on very
high preset with one thing changed so
that it goes to custom which is
anisotropic filtering at 16x running at
1600 p that's the crazy tier then one
step down we've got around 300 to 400
dollar tier where we're running just on
the very high preset at 16x anisotropic
filtering but at 1080p not 1600 p like
the tier above and then one step down
which is where we're running at 1080p
again but just on the hype reset and no
custom values at all and that's at about
the 150 hundred seventy dollar range two
things guys these numbers are very
subject to change Nvidia and AMD will
assuredly be releasing drivers in the
future as they always do and they will
probably be including optimizations for
thief so both of these numbers for
either teams could go up in varying
amounts we're not entirely sure but for
now you can just use it as kind of a
educated guess on how well this card
will perform in the future if you do buy
one or if you have one already also
another thing is these numbers were
pulled from newegg.com which is an
american website and especially AMD
cards pricing on this website is very
skewed because in the States especially
pricing for AMD cards has gone a little
bit nuts because of coin mining so if
you're someone who's not in the States
looking at this video maybe a card falls
into another bracket so it would highly
suggest checking out and comparing the
dollar value of these cards on your own
especially if you're outside of the
states
alright guys so here's the benchmarking
run so you guys can either replicate it
on your own or just see generally what
I'm doing we start just outside of the
main hideout in thief and then well this
isn't a crazy action game or is it it's
supposed to be played as a crazy action
game so I like a lot of my benchmarks
I'm not going to run around killing as
many people as I can within the two
minutes I'm actually just gonna kind of
go around and do some things that you
might do in tea for two minutes and
you'll notice that not a fair amount of
it is actually just looking in different
places or like coaching at certain times
and approaching through certain areas
that's mainly for timings that I can
actually easily replicate this run as
you can see here I've actually already
looted this house on a previous play
through but I knew exactly where the
house was and I knew I could navigate
through it quite easily so I went back
there for this playthrough stay alert
once I get through this window here I
had to save a few times to find a proper
safe for this as there's two guards in
this courtyard I can't waste a ton of
time trying to sneak around the guards
because that's not going to be the
easiest thing to replicate so I tried to
find a save file where I could actually
do this properly so if you're trying to
replicate this on your own you might
have to save a couple times to try and
make sure that the guards are in the
right spot but it's not too bad
Ron's the teeth
one thing I use is the sweep of mechanic
as you saw right there which was built
into the game to actually traverse
hoping you seem to easily I try to get
light late areas dark areas sweeping
mechanics crouching running walking all
that kind of stuff in its benchmark to
try and show all the different things
that you'll probably be doing a thief
quite actively we're nearing the end now
if we climb down this ladder
and as we run up the stairs we're coming
right to the end we're going to crouch
here and then shift through the light
and then the benchmark should end right
about here agree alright guys thanks for
watching my fief video if you want to
see all of our videos be sure to
subscribe to the channel like and
dislike while you're down there based on
whether or not you liked thief this is a
very controversial game and speaking of
liking thief comment in this comments
