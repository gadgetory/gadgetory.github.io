DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts hey there guys
welcome to my feet benchmarking overview
video we're gonna be testing things
today on the standard test bench of 40
960 X clocked at 4.0 gigahertz but at 16
gigs of ram clocked at 1866 megahertz
and a variance of GPUs who's
overclocking settings you can find in
the GPU overclocking dock linked below
this video so I broke up the graphics
cards into three tiers there's the
extreme tier with $500 plus graphics
cards which is running on very high
preset with one thing changed so that
goes to custom which is anisotropic
filtering at 16 X running at 1600 P
that's the crazy tier then one step down
we've got around 300 to $400 tier where
we're running just on the very high
preset at 16x anisotropic filtering but
at 1080 P not 1600 P like the tier above
and then one step down which is where
we're running at 1080p again but just on
the high preset and no custom values at
all and that's at about the 150 hundred
seventy dollar range two things guys
these numbers are very subject to change
Nvidia and AMD will assuredly be
releasing drivers in the future as they
always do and they will probably be
including optimizations for theif so
both of these numbers for either teams
could go up in varying amounts we're not
entirely sure but for now you can just
use it as kind of a educated guess on
how well this card will perform in the
future if you do buy one or if you have
one already also another thing is these
numbers were pulled from newegg.com
which is an American website and
especially AMD cards pricing on this
website is very skewed because in the
States especially pricing for AMD cards
has gone a little bit nuts because of
coin mining so if you're someone who's
not in the States looking at this video
maybe a card falls into another bracket
so it would highly suggest checking out
and comparing the dollar value of these
cards on your own especially if you're
outside of the States
alright guys so here's the benchmarking
run so you guys can either replicate it
on your own or just see generally what
I'm doing we start just outside of the
main hideout in theif and then well this
isn't a crazy action game or is it it's
supposed to be played as a crazy action
game so unlike a lot of my benchmarks
I'm not gonna run around killing as many
people as I can within the two minutes
I'm actually just gonna kind of go
around and do some things that you might
do in theif for two minutes
and you'll notice that not a fair amount
of it is actually just looking in
different places or like coaching at
certain times and coaching through
certain areas that's mainly for timing
so that I can actually easily replicate
this run as you can see here I've
actually already looted this house on a
previous playthrough but I knew exactly
where the house was and I knew I could
navigate through it quite easily so I
went back there for this playthrough
stay alert once I get to this window
here I had to save a few times to find a
proper safe for this as there's two
guards in this courtyard I can't waste a
ton of time trying to sneak around the
guards because that's not gonna be the
easiest thing to replicate so I tried to
find a safe file where I could actually
do this properly so if you're trying to
replicate this on your own you might
have to save a couple times to try and
make sure that the guards are in the
right spot but it's not too bad
to the teeth
one thing I use is the sweep of mechanic
as you saw right there because built
into the game to actually Traverse hope
you've seen too easily I try to get
light late areas dark areas sweeping
mechanics crouching running walking all
that kind of stuff in its benchmark to
try and show all the different things
that you'll probably be doing a thief
quite actively we're nearing the end now
if we climb down this ladder
and as we run up the stairs we're coming
right to the end we're gonna crouch here
and then shift through the light and the
benchmark should end right about here
alright guys thanks for watching my
video if you want to see all of our
videos be sure to subscribe to the
channel like and dislike while you're
down there based on whether or not you
liked theif this is a very controversial
game and speaking of liking thief's
comment in the comment section below
visit us on the forum favorite and share
this video as normal while you're on the
forum be sure to check out the thread
for this video as I'll more likely see
your comment there is the youtube
comment section just gets insane
sometimes and I can't even reply to
people and ridiculous well here on the
forum if you get tired of the ads be
sure to check out the contributor thing
in the store if you contribute at any
level you can get rid of all the
advertisements on the website so no
worries about that and we are now
selling shirts there's some pretty cool
ones coming on the way
I know Linus has a holy balls shirt
coming out with cats all over it playing
with cat toys of course that's exactly
what he means by that but anyways guys

you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
