at this time is pretty difficult to get
in North America this is a big quiet no
that's not how you say this is a be
quiet dark Power Pro ten high-end see
they helpfully call that up for you
high-end power supply this is an 80 plus
platinum power supply this is what they
consider to be a no compromises product
so that means even everything down to
spending war on the fan that's cooling
it they are using their own very
well-regarded silent wing fan see right
there you can see they're using a custom
fan they're using a custom enclosure
they're using custom pretty much
everything because again no compromises
so the highest efficiency the fully
modular interface let's just lemon we'll
get it open but no compromise silence
and performance so using virtually
inaudible silent wings fan world-class
efficiency up to 94% top performance
overclocking key for multi or single
rail use that's cool actually so you can
actually switch professional cable
management five-year warranty let's go
ahead and have a look at what else they
have to say for themselves here so 80
plus platinum versus 80 plus I guess
those graphs look more impressive if
your graph starts at 75% but trust me it
does make a difference dark power Pro
certification allows you to save up to
34 euros and electricity versus a
standard 80 plus per year per annum
that's sort of a more European so this
is a European brand actually that's
something you guys should be aware of
this is a German brand and you know
there's my car to give you some idea
what I think of German brands um it is a
little different and you know what it's
not it's not racism it's not like you
know it's just different I mean it's
it's the kinds of details that matter to
Germans versus the kinds of details that
matter to for example the Japanese like
Japanese why they're known for their
capacitors whereas that car for example
is just it feels really solid it's kind
of heavy it doesn't perform that great
it
by the way in case you guys can't tell
but little things like when you close
the doors like it just look it feels
like really solid the car actually has a
completely welded frame so there aren't
any seams there are no bolts in terms of
the of the outer shell of the car which
is which is kind of neat
so anyway okay so the car is not related
to the power supply other than the fact
that they are both designed in Germany
and I have a bit of a sort of
german-engineered bias let's just put it
that way
speaking of engineering be quiet is not
a rebrand er so if they I mean power
supplies it's no secret that every power
supply is made in Asia somewhere so no
it's not manufactured in Germany I'm
sorry
however be quiet unlike many other
companies out there is not simply taking
a design that someone else worked on and
rebranding it so what they're doing is
they are designing the power supply they
are designing the specification if
somehow you know someone can produce
something where they've already got a
kitted thing that's ready to go that
meets their spec then that's one thing
but otherwise they are actually having
it fully built from the ground up
according to their own spec so what that
means is little things like if you guys
have paid any attention to my videos
over the years you'll know I hate coil
line
be quiet does not accept coil one they
don't accept electrical noise because
the worst thing in the world is a great
power supply with a quiet fan that goes
when it's under load because there's
some coil somewhere or some component
inside that's making electrical noise
totally unacceptable so we're going to
fire this guy up just to make sure that
what I'm saying is accurate but from
what I understand about this brand about
what they're about is that they would
not accept that in any way shape or form
so let's go ahead and have a look at the
English so multi CPU based okay
virtually inaudible thanks to the silent
wings fan long will I spend up to three
hundred thousand hours thanks to a fluid
dynamic bearing with copper core and
individually balanced fan wheel yes
their fans are serious business guys
very well regarded worldwide like right
up there what they're not too is of the
world so bear that in mind you are
getting a good fan with your power
supply and you don't have to you know do
a dangerous fan swap in your PSU and
to make it happen so the a POC key for
either multi rail or single rail and
actually here we can have a look so if
you decide to go multi rail it'll be
four rails and if you decide to go
single rail then it'll be a single 70
amp rail capable of providing almost the
entire maximum output of the power
supply on the single rail tremely energy
efficient and the street parking optimal
cooling system and ok let's go ahead and
actually that's really cool check this
out has direct connectors for up to four
fins so the fan control can actually be
done by your power supply which is
actually like the smartest thing ever
because I would trust these guys to
manage my fans correctly versus a lot of
the tools that I've seen Valenta
motherboards and other things like that
I mean personally I'm using a t balancer
so it's a known factor for me but not
everyone has that luxury
pretty decent sleeving not the best I've
seen it's certainly not the worst I've
seen you can see it's even though
they're using fully colored cables
underneath it is looks pretty good even
when you bend it like that okay and this
is kind of neat got like a rubberized
like thing going on here for where the
24 pin comes out of the power supply so
it's not fully modular but it is almost
fully modular and since every system
needs a 24 pin and someone's going to be
a smartass and sort of make some comment
about a system that wouldn't need a 24
pin but you're wrong they'll need 24
pins if they're real systems these are
the 10 connectors so you can this is
kind of neat because even molex fans can
now be managed by your power supply or
you can plug in a 3 pin very good stuff
ok so it comes with four of those would
have liked to see those black but at the
end of the world they're fairly easy to
sleeve for what it's worth because
they've got these nice small connectors
on the ends this is cool so this is the
the OC key evidently so you can go ahead
you plug that in there you can actually
you can actually change it no way I
thought it was something where it's like
you know you set up your system you like
put it in or don't put it in but oh wait
no no hold on yeah no you can okay so
you can either just jumper it front look
at all these options hilarious so you
can
either jump for it permanently or you
can go well I might want to switch
between multi rail or single rail
sometime in the future just like that
okay you can tell this is a sample unit
from Europe because this won't be useful
to me but okay comes with manual so it's
available in a variety of different
wattages 850 1000 and 1200 for the dark
power Pro 10 Dutch English safety
instructions stuff like that and is it
very nice I love matte black boxes with
silver writing that's just the best
thing ever these look very nice too
actually these feel good you can often
tell are they using high quality wires
inside or are they not just by taking
the cables and feeling them again
actually this might be better sleeping
than what's on here mmm no it's the same
okay maybe I just sort of maybe I was
judging this too harshly because the
sleeving looks and feels really good
very flexible very difficult to see even
no matter what I do to it you can't
really see through it very well very
nice cable sleeping and lots of included
logical tables let's see what we've got
going on here okay give me a second oh
I'll just plug things in and then we'll
have a look now this is actually one of
the most flexible and smartest modular
cable packages that I've ever seen yeah
I'm not going to not going to mince
words about it because this is
outstanding so a couple things okay
number one yes 850 watt power supply so
why would you need six PCIe 8 pin
connectors I will tell you why you need
that because it's not necessarily for
triple GPU setup it could be for a dual
GPU setup where for example you know not
that cards like this exist a single card
might have three PCIe connectors on it
then they give you an additional single
PCIe 6 pin that can also plug in which
you know not that not that these exist
but you know I heard that there is a
rumour that there might be like
motherboards coming in the future that
have an auxilary 6 pin PCI e connector
so you see these configurations on the
motherboards and on the video cards and
you kind of go what power supply is
actually designed to run a couple of
in SLI with a 6-10 auxiliary connector
plugged into the board the Sealy power
supply I've ever seen where you won't
have to do something goofy like plug in
sort of too many connectors or too few
connectors depending on your config very
smart the way they've done the PCIe so
there you go
and each harness gives you two 6 plus
2's ok moving right along so the 24 pin
goes over there ah yes the CPU connector
so you can see the modular cable
includes a 4 plus 4 or an 8 pin and
they're both attached and I've seen this
a lot of times where modular power
supplies will not really give you any
flexibility like for example the Cougar
SX 850 the modular or not module I don't
remember whatever the cable for the CPU
power connector has like 2 8 pins on a 4
pin on one harness I'm looking at this
going are you kidding me how many boards
need that well be quite I thought of
that so they include that one or they
include a single a pin or they include a
single 4 pin totally up to you what you
want to plug into that slot since you
can configure it as a single rail power
supply anyway it doesn't matter if
you're doing two connectors off one port
or one connector off one port or
whatever else the case may be
now again it's like yeah cardinal sin
number one on power supplies is making a
modular interface with five plugs and
including five cables that are just you
know like there's two molex harnesses
and then like three say darkness and
you're like okay so I put them all in
now it's not modular anymore because
everything you plugged in is everything
that you could possibly need and you get
like and every harness looks like this
now you might have a system that needs
you to Saito's and then a couple molexes
and then a floppy or you might not so
they've included a lot of smart
harnesses this one for example I only
have a single molex connector that I
need in my system on the battle actually
now I have two now well at any rate I
used to only have a single one end I
could just use two of these see two so I
have two that I need one plugs into the
back of my zone or since soundcard and
the other one plugs into my MCP six five
five pump that's it so why do I have to
it's a huge harness with four connectors
when I have a modular power supply
why aren't they including options that I
care about so you've got two single
molex ones you've also got this one a
single SATA one you've got a multi SATA
one so this guy you have would be the
three SATA connectors this guy's got
three SATA connectors you've got a three
molex one you've got a two molex one and
a floppy you've got that one I showed
you before with the couple say days and
a few molex and two molexes and a floppy
so you've actually got flexibility
you've actually got options in terms of
what you're plugging into your modular
interface now we haven't taken a close
look at the overall fit and finish of
the power supply yet and that is again
where the whole you know German
engineering etcetra etcetra thing that
Volkswagen would have you believe really
starts to come in so everything looks
really good you know you got your silver
and your maybe plus platinum and your
warranty void okay that doesn't look
very good but other than that this is
unique haven't seen anything like this
before so it's got a fan girl that you
know you're not gonna be a problem
you're not going to be able to
accidentally like touch the fan but I
guess if you wanted to touch the fan you
could looks very slick anyway that's for
sure especially with that fan spinning
in there that looks great they've got
everything oriented correctly so as long
as you've got a sort of 99.9 percent of
cases out there that mount the power
that the window on this side the text
will be right side up no matter what you
do and add this is smart to that
warranty void if removed is on the side
where you're less likely to have it
facing because this on most cases these
days will dryer and right from the
bottom of the case through a filter and
you will see just this looks good check
this out as well see this rubber noise
dampening so that will keep vibrations
from passing from the power supply to
the case just another you know nice
little touch that I haven't seen before
and makes sense this a little bit apart
from the competition that does not
include noise isolated on the power
supply so whether your case includes it
or not you will have a noise dampened
vibration isolating power supply no
matter what because the Germans have
deemed it to be Leslie so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and terrible
German accent I'm just never going to do
that again of the dark power
ten from be quiet bad joke too and don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
from on boxing's reviews and other
computer videos and we've is something
check this out
so they actually include cable
management's velcro's which is not
unique at all lots of guys include these
however normally when you see these
included they include like two or three
be quiet has included a whack of them I
mean we could count them if we wanted
one two three four five six ten of them
which is actually enough to help cable
manage your system because it's one
thing when they're just making a gesture
of you know yeah we included cable
management velcro's but it's another
thing when they actually include enough
that you can actually cable manage your
whole system with the very cool stuff
also some zip ties okay just a few of
those and this is what I'm actually
excited about oh yes sexy thumb screws I
mean it does not get any better than
that that is your power supply mounting
screw that is beastly way to go be quiet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
