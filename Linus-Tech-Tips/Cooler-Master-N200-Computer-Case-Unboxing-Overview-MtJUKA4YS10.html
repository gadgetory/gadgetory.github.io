for more details welcome to my unboxing
and first look at the N 200 it's about
time micro-atx started really getting
the attention it deserves as a
performance computing platform because
there have been motherboards for a long
time but there haven't really been any
great case options or you know liquid
cooled high performance micro ATX
systems and this is all changing very
quickly so the end 200 is cooler masters
sort of kick at the can here with
support for up to three hundred and
fifty five millimeter graphics cards I
think that's the number yeah three
hundred fifty five millimeter or up to
14 inch graphics cards dual 120
millimeter radiator in the front single
120 mil radiator in the back removable
hard drive cage mesh front for optimal
cooling all that good stuff and add a
price that I think you folks will find
pretty attractive let's go ahead and
flip this bad boy over ah here we go
pop these out because otherwise they get
caught on things I drove me crazy whoops
I'm sorry I bumped the mic there my bad
my bad guys oh and it's apt me with
static see this is why you want to
ground yourself before actually building
a computer in a case so it uses a hard
foam but again I did an unboxing
recently on another case where I kind of
gave it a pass anyway because these em
ATX cases aren't that heavy even once
they're loaded up so they don't need as
much protection and shipping and cruder
minister has been doing this for a while
so i'm sure that they've done some kind
of a validation on the foam before
shipping a bunch of cases all over the
world using it because it's really just
not worth it to recall products it's
better to just do the validation in the
first place
so here my friends is the end 200 we're
going to do something unusual we're
going to start on the bottom here is the
removable fan filter for the rear
mounted bottom mounted power supply it
comes off a little something like that
and slips back in a little something
like that it locks into place so you
won't
accidentally pull it out although I
don't think that's really an issue there
are rubber feet on the bottom on the
plastic feet that are also on the bottom
so it's not going to slip and slide all
over the place and let's go ahead and
flip this bad boy
oh yeah on the front we find some mesh
okay
we also find some glossy plastic so
we're going to go ahead and take the
cover off of that very very shiny if you
guys wanted to catch a glimpse of what
be role the intern looks like I'm sure I
just caught him there so there you go
there's some some glossy plastic this is
an interesting IO combination on the
front so you got your reset switch your
power switch your presumably activity
led of some sort oh that's yeah that's
activity led your power LEDs in there
headphone microphone USB 2 and a single
USB 3 port and I personally like still
having USB 2 ports on the front of my
case in fact on my own personal system I
have only two USB 3 ports in the front
and it kind of drives me crazy because
there's a particular device that I have
and every time I'm plug it in a blue
screens because USB 3 compatibility
isn't always quite to the same level as
USB 2 and a lot of the time what you
want is you just want to plug something
into the front for convenience not
necessarily for maximum performance so I
do still like to see that looks like the
front bezel pops off just like this and
you can get some additional ventilation
in the front there just like that
oh there you go it came right off no big
deal ok so inside here what do we find
um ventilation ok there you go that's
what it looks like not attached to the
case we can also see what the front of
the case looks like so check this out
you can do a 2 by 120 millimeter cooler
in the front regardless of the spacing
this is really smart I like this
approach or what they've done is they've
given you slots instead of holes for one
of the 120 millimeter fans that goes in
the front so regardless of how the
spacing works you can go ahead and mount
it in there I also like when the front
bezel pops off easily
it looks like coolermaster might intend
for you to install things this way so
you can pop out your Bay cover so it's
got a single 5 and a quarter and single
three and a half inch front Bay you can
install them and then you can pop the
whole thing back on but it's uh it's
it's it's kind of obnoxious when they
attach all the wires to the front piece
and then you pull it off and then it's
all
attached with wires and stuff so I like
it when it comes off cleanly we're going
to go ahead and put that back on though
so we can stop harping on the front
bezel and move on so on the side we've
got a single 120 millimeter fed that is
positioned correctly for your graphics
card if you're using an internal exhaust
graphics card slip can you hand me one
of those maybe that XFX one right there
rather than a blower style card that
sends all of the air out of the back of
the case I would generally recommend
using this as an exhaust so the graphics
card is going to sit right around here
on the inside of the case and you can
see that it's going to be bringing in
air here and then blowing it out the top
of the card a lot so in order to not
fight with that natural process you're
going to want to go ahead and use that
as an exhaust intake is perfect though
for a blower style card which most
reference cards usually are with the
notable exception being AMD is all new
7990 which uses a triple fan cooler on
the top you find room for either a 120
millimeter or 140 millimeter fan and
they've got a little little rubber
pieces here that have a little fan
filter attached to them so that's sort
of unique I hadn't seen that before the
120 millimeter fan is offset that's
going to give you better compatibility
with motherboards that have beefy
cooling components up at the top of them
this side has a little bit of extra
space punched out for cable management
we've seen this before and I actually
don't mind that approach because it
keeps the overall case nice and slim but
gives you enough room for the cable
management that you need in the back
this is a fairly value conscious case so
I'm not expecting anything exceptional
in terms of like huge you know
thick steel side panels but it's solid
enough I mean it's the same thing I said
before Coolermaster has been doing this
a while so it's not like they don't know
how to make a side panel and a case not
fall apart when you're trying to build
your computer in it on the inside we
find our internal connectors as well as
a fairly unique layout so this is kind
of that is kind of neat okay so check
this up we've got where are the included
pieces for these this is interesting so
the three and a half inch drive mounts
here there are two of them look like
they are intended to be removed so you
can go ahead and take these screws out
take out the bottom screws and then it's
not riveted in in any way you can go
ahead this nice
solid though so you can take that out
and that gives you more flexibility in
terms of cooling options up here and it
also allows you to utilize the
rear-mounted SSD mounts so here you go
they include little grommets which are
in here look a little something like
that
there's your grommets don't worry too
much about it B roll it's okay
and so you use those and you can
actually mount two SSDs here on the back
of the motherboard trace look could I
get an SSD preferably an on Coolermaster
conflicting brand one that one's fine
top of the pile bam thank you sir
alright so here's a samsung 830 so you'd
go ahead and pop that on there the
screws I personally love SSDs I think
everyone should love SSDs the same
amount that I do and I like having more
options for mounting them on the back of
things as opposed to on the front of
things so if you're not using hard
drives in your system and you're using
an as for your mass storage then this is
a perfect perfect option for the case
just pull that out get more cooling
awesome ok huge CPU cutout is right here
not that much flex to the motherboard
tray considering again the enormous CPU
cutout and the fact that once you put a
motherboard on it it won't be that bad
and cable routing options so this is
where that popped outside comes in
because if it wasn't for that you can
see where it lines up right here is
right where this is in order to get any
sort of cables from the power supply up
here you're going to want to be
utilizing that however it should be
noted guys you will not be routing your
24-pin connector behind the motherboard
tray in this case that is not going to
be happening your power supplies going
to go hmm right here and you're going to
mount that or you're going to take that
right directly up to the 24 pin
connector on the motherboard which is
probably going to be right around here
there's more SSD mounting options as far
as I can tell they're just kind of all
over the place this is kind of neat so
it looks like there's another one here
yeah so you pop that in there and go
like that so there's another one there
it looks like if you pull really it
looks like if you pull this three and a
half inch bay out there's a No
I can't be raped no no okay okay no
nevermind but it looks like there's
another one here on the back could it be
I don't know maybe it's not intended as
a mouth but you could certainly Chuck
one there without much difficulty so you
can kind of put SSDs sort of anywhere
you want I wonder what that's for I'm
gonna find out what that's for
okay so it looks like that's probably
intended for just cable management so
you can check your power supply cables
back there however I'm I would be likely
to sort of hide an SSD back there but
anyway so there there's SSD mount here
here here and here so there's four sort
of proper ones that are me sort of
ghetto rigging things for expansion
slots which is pretty normal for em ATX
single 120 millimeter cooling fan in the
back but you could put in an 80 or a 92
if you so desired and I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the N 200 from cooler master it
should be noted that the advanced
version comes with two USB 3.0 ports in
a single USB 2.0 port don't forget to
