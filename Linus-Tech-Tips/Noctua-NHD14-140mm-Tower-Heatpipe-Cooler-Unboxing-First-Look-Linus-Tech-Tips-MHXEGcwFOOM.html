product from Noctua actually there are
two new products from Noctua that I'm
gonna unbox this is one of them and the
other one is here so you can check out
the other video and probably a day or
two but this is the nhd 14 this is their
largest heat pipe cooler today to give
you some idea of the scale of this thing
here it is next to my head okay this is
a huge huge box so as you may or may not
have figured out based on the 14 in the
name this cooler uses a 140 millimeter
or 14 centimeter fan so let's start
getting this opened up we first have the
accessory package inside here now we've
just gotten these in stock these were
actually just released very recently by
oculus so let's see what we've got
first of all we have a screwdriver okay
so they include a screwdriver for you to
mount whatever it is you need to mount
then inside here we have a metal knock
to a case badge very shiny very nice
quality for fan screws we have two low
noise adapters and then two ultra-low
noise adapters we have a tube of nth one
thermal compound and we also have last
but not least four of their rubber
isolating fan nose so four screws and
four rubber fan mounts then we have and
Noctis manuals are exceptional always
they've actually this oh this is cool
okay so they got a little package here
then there's the intel side and the AMD
side so it comes with separate
instructions depending where you're
going to mount it their manuals are
always excellent and include all of the
steps it's all color-coded very nice I
really appreciate that when I'm trying
to mount something okay then we have the
AMD mounting hardware and next is the
Intel mounting hardware now the way they
have updated their new SEC you firm to
mounting hardware is such that you can
use it on LGA 775 1156
and 1366 without any sorts of
modifications or anything like that now
let's get down into the next layer this
is a box it is empty
actually it is full of another box which
is here okay and then down in the bottom
there's more come out okay
so there's nothing in there this is just
a box wow this is really well packed
actually that's awesome because there's
I can't see any conceivable way this
thing could be damaged in shipment it
has like so much packing around it so
that's another box alright let's get to
the actual cooler itself now finally now
what I didn't tell you I did say this
was a 140 millimeter cooler but what I
didn't tell you is that it is also a 120
millimeter cooler the nhd 14 i'm gonna
double-check yet d 14 okay here is our
nickel plated copper base with six heat
pipe coolers okay but this is not only a
one 40 mil fan it is also a 120mm fan
cooler so you can see it in actually got
two sandwiched heat pipe towers each
with six heat pipes because they're
doing the u-shape at the bottom where it
runs up through both and then they've
actually got a 120mm fan on the one side
and then a 140 millimeter fan in the
middle now I want to turn this around
this way so you can see why they made
the design decision the way they did the
140 millimeter fan the way it's mounted
here you can see it actually goes like
way down close towards the motherboard
if they had actually used a 140
millimeter fan on the other side then
you would have had clearance problems
potentially with RAM or with the mosfet
coolers or whatever else so they've made
this decision in order to maintain
compatibility at a very high level
now Noctua engineers everything for
silence everything they do from the
little notches in the edges of the fan
blades to the way that they sorry I'm
turning this around really fast to the
way that they do the ridges on the
leading edge of the heat pipe coolers
now one thing I'll talk about really
quickly before I wrap this up I mean
this thing is a monster here's that
here's the head shot for scale again
this thing is huge
and it's actually quite heavy as well is
I just want to talk a little bit about
the the 14 140 millimeter fan 14
centimeter fan itself this is compatible
with both 12 centimeter or 120
millimeter fan mounts or 140 millimeter
fan mounts you can buy it separately so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and product overview of the Noctua
and I've gotten forgotten NHD 14</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
