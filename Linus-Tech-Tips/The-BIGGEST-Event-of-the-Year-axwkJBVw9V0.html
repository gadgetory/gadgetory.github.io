are we doing we're doing an LTI Xtreme
we're talking about LTI X coz LTX
tickets are on sale right now we
actually went on sale an hour ago so in
typical linus media group fashion we are
fashionably late yeah we are they tell
you guys that tickets are on sale so
there's some really good news but
there's also a little bit of news that
might be somewhat disappointing to some
of you so I'll let you go through your
first your first bit I mean my first
bits just talking about TX case you know
l TX is Linus tech Expo tickets are on
sale right now it's an event that we're
hosting here in Vancouver with Dreamhack
it's gonna be on July 27 28 I am so
excited for this okay that last bit that
he said okay there's actually two of
those last bits okay so one of them was
Dreamhack did that register I just want
to make sure yeah and the other one was
July 27th and 28th - did that register
it is a two-day event and there's no
break Wow
so Dreamhack is helping us out with both
a BYOC and free Playland gaming set up
there and the vancouver convention
center somehow that's where it's gonna
be we are stepping up like we're going
big league this time we're not at like
an ice rink or whatever like we did the
first year what yeah it seemed like a
strong idea I'm trying
it's just everyone chill okay I'm sore
at the Vancouver conventions that are
somehow Dreamhack has been like actually
amazing to partner with so far here they
talked them into keeping it open all
night
so people with b-y-o-see tickets you
guys are hanging out at LTX for the day
you are gaming all night and then you
are walking around like a zombie the
next day because yeah and just to be
clear the BYOC you can be in it during
while LTX is oh yeah so the LTX hours
are gonna be 11:00 to 6:00 that's for
both days and any time during LTX or
overnight between the two days you can
go chill to BYOC if you get a ticket
their in-game and I think quite a few of
us will be here I'll be there like it'll
be buy a ticket no did you buy one no
yeah you got one dude yeah you can go
you should stream
I don't even care I'm just got I'm just
gonna bring like a card table house put
my laptop side it like you know what you
know what yeah kick me out go for
tyranny security some guy won't know who
you are who but get out of here you
don't have a ticket like You Know Who I
am this is my event no I don't yeah oh
man this is praveen hack turf perfect
perfect okay so what else you got
I mean I was just gonna talk about LTX
yeah cool no I mean so it started with a
dream a dream of seeing that pax made a
lot of money
and thinking gee maybe we could do the
same thing actually you know it's funny
it actually did start with us trying to
make it a profitable event and then so
the first year we were like okay let's
like let's like try and break even and
then the next year we'll make a profit
and did we break even the first year I
don't I think we were close though yeah
sure so we were like okay you know what
that was really fun and we didn't lose
much money so we should be able to be
profitable next year let's do it again
so the second year we we actually had a
bigger venue we we spent more on the
prep and once again if I recall
correctly we lost a little bit of money
right yeah but it was a lot of fun so
you're number three okay that's what
we're on this year we threw out the goal
of making money cuz we were just like
the reason we keep doing this is because
it's a total blast cuz clearly the
making money part is not working so
let's just blow all the money so our
budget for LTX this year is somewhere in
the neighborhood of about a quarter
million dollars and you know what if we
make it back spectacular but if we don't
the idea is that what LTX has kind of
become whether by on purpose or by
accident is just like a giant
get-together for not just Linus tech tip
staff and fans but last year was the
year that it really like changed and it
became oh well hold on a second well now
there's other like tech personalities
there Steve from gamers Nexus showed up
James $0.02 showed up
showed up Barney Cleese showed up Bob
and rod from BS mods showed up all of a
sudden we had like this
Barney of way yeah there's a crew that
was there and it was really cool not
just for us because some of the other
like influencers and tech personalities
that they showed up they were like I was
blown away by how many people at L you
know the else for Linus I guess at LTX
we're like here to see me
and just like swarming me so we're like
okay okay no no this is this is good
this is different so this year it's all
about just throwing a gigantic bash with
cool stuff to do great stuff to see
hopefully a lot of cool influencers are
showing up is there anyone that has
confirmed to the point where we can say
they'll be there I mean I was just gonna
kind of go through the list of people
that we've like actively reached out to
I don't think like people have you know
all of these people who expressed
interest in coming we don't have people
hundred percent booked the last thing we
want to do is say so and so I was gonna
be there then they're not there yeah
these are super busy people their
schedules can change absolutely at the
last possible minute and we totally get
it but there's the list that I have do
we want do we want to say who is who has
expressed interest at the very least or
who we've actively like start Odin
let's put it that way these are people
that we have talked to about Cummings
yep we're not gonna put any words in
their mouths they're gonna be like what
all right so Jake Jays two cents Steve
gamers Nexus Barnack Lee's a postbox I'm
sorry I don't know how to pronounce aqua
CooCoo
how do I pronounce your YouTube channel
I'm sorry I'm probably Ruta lysing that
tech deals hardware connects low spec
gamer Staci Roy I just seen Wendell
level one Tech's Austin Evans Kyle from
bit Lal I don't know if we've Rebecca I
don't know worries anyway anyway also if
there's anybody else that you guys want
to see it LTX make sure to hit them up
on Twitter Facebook wherever and get
them to contact us and they should they
should come hang out cuz it's gonna be
it see me a lot of fun so as part of the
whole just like you know what it's gonna
be expensive but who cares we're just
throwing like a party
we have agreed for a lot of like
influencers and personalities to help
what I'm not gonna say okay I will say
this not everyone is necessarily getting
exactly the same offer like if there's
someone that has like 50 million
subscribers like if PewDiePie was like
yeah I want to show up at LTX like dude
flight hotel you want to bring a crew
like like well we'll do what we can to
make it happen you're inviting PewDiePie
what we if PewDiePie showed up I'd be
pretty stupid
yeah yeah I'd love to meet him
not a huge fan of the content
necessarily but I that's fine yeah I'd
be PewDiePie right anyway so the point
is like we are we're doing we're not
gonna pay people to show up people are
only gonna come to LTX
if they like want to be there but we're
definitely trying to help people out to
make it possible for them to be here
especially some of the smaller channels
that the I like paying for a flight in a
hotel is just not you know feasible on
top of taking three to four days out of
their busy schedule to come to an event
like this so we are we are we are we are
like dumping dumping moolah into making
this thing as awesome as we can make it
yeah we're really trying to bring the
community together we're trying to get
everybody to experience tech hardware
like firsthand obviously we got the
Dreamhack partnership which is which is
huge ice gaming PC gaming you know
what's really I I have actually had like
so I used to be somewhat involved in the
Vancouver like LAN gaming scene you know
I used to go to the old Kaplan's that
were just in like a student utility room
at half college yeah
Vancouver I went to a couple of those
Lower Mainland was like I think that was
like an effort to rejuvenate it or maybe
land Coover was the effort to rejuvenate
it Lower Mainland was the old one
I don't remember anyway like I used to
attend these things and the whole scene
just kind of died it fizzled out no one
had the passion to bring land gaming to
Vancouver and no event ever really got
the kind of momentum that
PDX land or like Fraga Palooza over in
edmonton god and and we just kind of
gave up and you know what's really cool
is that i've been out of the scene for
like eight or nine years at this point
like i haven't attended a land party in
that long but there's still guys that
are still doing like small grassroots
tile lands and over the last couple of
months since we announced LTX whiffle
and party people like hey partner with
dreamhack people have been crawling out
of the woodwork that i haven't talked to
in nearly a decade like man this is
great
you guys were perfectly positioned to do
this I was just waiting for you guys to
pull the freaking trigger and the
partnership with Dreamhack unreal match
made in heaven so stoked imma be there
thanks Dreamhack and like these are
people that like to put it in to put it
in perspective these guys are like on my
Steam friends list or whatever which I
literally haven't looked at in years
because they've got filled with like
span invites and stuff and I was just I
got forget it so I like never sign into
it but these are people that I was like
buddies with before I ever uploaded a
YouTube video like these are just people
who like og holy crap
hey dude you know haven't talked to him
forever but like guess I'm coming to
your event like haha famous guy like
they're just like like buds like there's
one guy that I just hung around in like
the they converted their garage it's
like they they insulated it ran some
power over there and converted into like
a gaming no seems like that's what I was
in school like I'm so exciting to just
see the Vancouver land community again
and of course there's gonna be a lot of
people coming from as far as all over
North America and even overseas we've
had people show up from literally the
other side of the globe at previous LT
X's so yeah we're gonna be offering a
reward I think I think we're gonna do
like just random Awards like little like
little things on the main stage and
it'll be like whoever has flown out here
from the car that about to get surprised
oh I just ruined the surprise
there'll be there will be something to
be lots of stuff like that there will be
some weird prizes and one of them will
probably be whoever
has proof of address for the location
that is farthest according to Google
Maps from the Vancouver Convention
Center I'm expecting it to be like it's
literally draw a line through the center
of the earth and like something's right
there yeah yeah yeah hundred percent
yeah
yeah no it's gonna be sick
so Dreamhack I'm just gonna go over kind
of what Dreamhack is doing with us so
obviously as we've mentioned multiple
times we're parting with Dreamhack so
we're gonna be offering a 500 PC BYOC
100 PC free play area and an indie zone
so those who will be those who purchase
would be yoc ticket will be sent an
email for you to choose your seats at
like a later time so if you buy your
ticket now don't worry like oh like me
and a friend bought a ticket do we get
to sit next to each other like they will
send an email oh and you guys can select
your seats so BYOC ticket holders will
be provided with a table space chair
Ethernet port and two power sockets you
must provide everything else for the PC
setup so tower monitor peripherals
cables no speakers allowed so just
headphones obviously big crowded space
you got your boombox LAN party at your
yeah yeah exactly
um as we've already mentioned the BYOC
be open all night between the Saturday
and Sunday so you won't be kicked out
that's so cool they'll be hosting get
casual gaming casual tournaments for
small prizes and trophies games are TBA
obviously like as we get close to the
damn sure we'll figure that out or even
at the event it might just be yeah this
might end up being kind of ran I haven't
been to a dreamhack DLC so I'm pretty
stoked me neither yeah like I am super
stoked you can't sleep at the venue
don't don't sleep at the venue okay
please guys you can stay there in game
oh yeah just like pass out yeah you
can't just like yeah hold on this is a
you can take a nap on your keyboard
really you just can't lay on the floor
chair so you give us like prop yourself
up at your gaming station you'll be okay
Wow yeah hold on a sec side yeah you
could get like what like a bag you know
and you just unplug your keyboard so
it's not gonna like mash it but you just
you push your monitor back a little bit
you take that thing you put it right on
your desk and you just go like this boom
you just everyone's just we should kind
of defeats the purpose
we should make that product the land
sleeper the landslide the land sleeper
it's just a beanbag small beanbag and
you just you just face you just yeah
office workers plane I'd use that in the
plane screw the neck pillow try the neck
pillow sucks sucks is terrible no no
okay geez item safety yeah yeah okay so
the BYOC will be badge restricted so
obviously have to have a PFC badge to
get in yeah
Dreamhack won't be registering your
equipment so keep an eye on your own
stuff make friends of your neighbor keep
an eye on their stuff yeah
they have never had a tower stolen only
small things like wallets and phones so
just don't leave small stuff out
obviously if you're walking away if you
want to go to LTX for a bit you want to
leave come back just grab all your small
stuff and go and then come back so heck
yeah
all right free play free play so that
will be the free play area will have a
hundred pcs with all peripherals
included so you can just walk up in-game
each will have a steam account with
about 50 games installed sit down play
whatever you want for 45 minutes at a
time when your time is up you can jump
right back in line as many times as you
want so that's just to keep the things
moving in case it fills up and people
are waiting constantly they're also
gonna be running a stream zone so eight
powerful PC stations set up so you can
stream directly from the show floor
applications will be released next week
actually I think you can actually sign
up the applications are in the video
description okay preference given to
people who have like larger presences on
Twitch for example for these streams
though I think yes I don't know exactly
how they do it but I don't know exactly
how they do it but like you know I would
assume so I wonder if all I want to save
a spot for me Cal tain you stations will
be a few stations will be reserved for
walk up learn how to stream sessions so
that's really cool so if you've always
been interested in learning how to
stream there will be a few stations for
you to walk up and somebody will be
there to actually teach you how to set
up and do a stream which is really cool
so because I find streaming can be hard
to get into if you've never done
anything like it Thomas says me and my
friends are all bought and ready to come
out to us from New York yeah yeah and I
guess the biggest thing that'd be while
seeing like we obviously can't guarantee
this because we'll be working all day
during the day and all day the day after
but I know me myself I'm gonna be the
BYOC and I'm sure lots of other element
so we get to hang out with
as well so Daniels fishing says in the
10-year live stream you and Yvonne
explained why you can't just like
constantly do meetups says made sense to
him so the trip tailed TX is booked he's
coming to the official need up good
stuff tickets bought excitements real
nice what's the picture with his
daughter sure I mean that is what it's
all about
like I I don't plan to hide away in fact
LTX has been like the most exhausting
day of the year for the last two years
in a row like in a really fun like
fulfilling amazing way but like really
tiring it's I'm lucky if I managed to
find time to take a couple bites of food
which it's a two day event this year so
I might allow myself to take a lunch
break but we have more time we're being
a lot more organized - yeah setup and
stuff so I think you'll mean a lot
better so I want to be I want to be out
there like I've had people walk up to me
adults he acts like hey do you mind if I
take a picture like yeah dog get your
phone out do it do it like oh my gosh
he's just like he is in the videos yes I
was expecting this yeah I mean that's
the whole point of the event right yes
and I think that's one thing that we did
better in 2018 but we need to improve on
is having more volunteers to help out
with the booths themselves so the lmg
folk can hang out mingle and like play
games so like if you're not much of a
Linus fan cuz he's like a jerk to his
staff or whatever hang out with Steve
hang out with Alex or whatever get a
picture get them signed stuff like it's
cool yeah do we want to talk about some
of the booths that we're gonna have
there we can talk about some of the
booths yep okay do you want to do our
booths first or do you want to do I
didn't write down all the booths
actually well I had brands that we've
same thing as the creator list brands
that we reached out to who are
interested in coming to have been
hundred percent confirmed so I'm just
gonna run through the list apologies
everybody's watching and I miss your
name okay you can just send me an email
and yell at me later okay so MSI
verdaguer razer gigabyte logitech Leon
Lee LG g.skill Sennheiser iBUYPOWER
alpha cool rock at so tech Mossback
madrenas mass drop and I'm sure there's
more than we're missing I can already
think of a couple seriously I didn't
like half of these yeah I mean these are
people that were in talks with and who
are interested
helping with the event in some way
doesn't mean that they're necessary have
a booth but they are interested in
partnering with us for part of the event
so it should be cool so some of these
though will just be to help us set up
our own booth so some of them are gonna
be things like the CPU D Living booth
where you can learn how to delete a CPU
that was way more popular last year than
we thought the VR booth Alex super
stoked on the VR booth so last year we
had I think three headsets yeah this
year the goal is a dozen if I think it
dozen but then we also have other VR
experiences too so I know right now you
guys are working on the VR RC car thing
yes we're trying to do and we're also
partnering with escape VR so we're gonna
be doing like a six person yeah our
escape room which is pretty cool if you
come with your friends or if you meet
people at the show or whatever you want
to go try and do a VR escape room
together we're gonna have that there
that's that's gonna be free for people
to do right yeah yeah to be clear some
stuff is gonna cost money like merch or
whatever else but we want the
experiences to be things that once you
got your ticket you're in you're doing
stuff because the tickets honestly
aren't that cheap this was an
extraordinarily expensive event to put
on between the much larger venue trying
to get creators there we actually are
we're not doing like like an elementary
school science fair style approach to
our booth design this year no we're not
we got a real company to help us this
age no I don't think it's been like a
hundred percent okay alright we're still
twice and also like productions to the
main stage we're actually gonna have two
big screens and a few remote viewing
screens for people if they're like
interested in what's going on on the
main stage while you're walking through
the LTX event so that'll be a lot better
I know in the past the stage has been
very just a little stage oops that's a
good term yeah I'll take that I'll take
that but yeah we're going legit like
we've had fun with it
but the technical details could have
been a lot yeah and then another thing
that we're doing is if you can't make it
so just to be clear this is millage it
if you can make it make it but if you
can't we will be live-streaming parts of
the event we haven't figured out exactly
what the schedule is going to be yeah
but we will be live-streaming a
floatplane so if you're a floatplane
member
don't know what to call it yeah cuz we
were gonna call it Virtual Ticket there
was some discussion about this virtual
ticket includes like oh yeah you've got
behind the scenes this and you've got
that and you've got every single panel
and every honestly where we're doing our
best but we think it's very unlikely
we're gonna be organized enough to put
together like a gigantic package like
that so it's gonna include some key
panels it'll include
if we can pull off like a wireless
streaming thing it'll include like a
walkthrough of the floor you know just
kind of some-some men in the crowd or
lady in the crowd is it were just like
watching things going on but it's not
gonna be the whole experience but it's
also not gonna cost that much it's gonna
be included for anyone who has a
floatplane subscription so a floatplane
subscription will probably by that time
be five dollars a month it's three right
now so if you're into saving two dollars
a month and you care at all about early
access to Linus tech tips content and
that's cool I haven't talked to Luke
about the technical nitty-gritty of
getting this working but I would love
for it to be available to anyone who is
subscribed to any creator on floatplane
who is there
so there's already someone that we're in
talks with about being there Kyle who is
on flow plane also tech deals actually
for that matter so the idea is that
while it's not going to be a
full-fledged Virtual Ticket experience
it will be something and it will be a
lot cheaper than getting in a plane and
going to LTX so there you go that says
that's as firm as we have it the good
news though is like guys even though
there's a lot of stuff that's still
moving parts right now we are still four
months away from this event and we
actually have time to to get the stuff
together like honestly four months from
the event we were still at the lake I
think we hadn't even and I think the
first year and we have announced the
event what booths are we gonna have you
had no idea whereas we actually have for
better for worse you know concept art of
all of the booths in fact we have some
renders now don't we
I don't have any renders that I can
share right now okay and they're like
not they're not great renders we're
gonna get real renders and pay for plans
and stuff like that so that'll be good
so there's gonna be lots more details
coming but what I would
is that okay you know what I'll let you
talk about the urgency of buying tickets
you're just you didn't want me to say
certain stuff so I'm just gonna check
what urgency if I okay if you are coming
LTX just buy your ticket right now so we
are doing tiered ticket pricing this
year so that means if you don't buy your
ticket now and you wait like I'm there
I'll be tears if you wait six weeks I
think tears yeah they'll be tears yeah
like exactly it will be more expensive
yeah essentially assuming that are we so
are we holding in reserve some tickets
for the future cuz I know some stuff is
outright sold out already yes like VIP
is possibly VIPs out VIPs VIP sold out
my two minutes it's done yeah yeah but
sorry about that anyone who was waiting
for the stream instead of where did we
even announce the tickets we're going on
so how did that social fast social we
did all the social yeah great okay so
basically tickets will be more expensive
the longer you wait okay that's all we
can save there you go
yes essentially you're coming oh my god
ticket also another thing too is that we
need volunteers for the event so if
you're interested in volunteering
there's a forum down in the video
description as well so fill that out
we'll probably be going through it
through it in March so we will follow up
and yeah we need definitely need a lot
more volunteers this year to make this
happen okay so on both the LTX and
Dreamhack side so okay yeah cool wasn't
me sick is that it I mean that's all
there is to say I mean we can get into
like the nitty-gritty like details like
like the exact booths and stuff but I
think it's changing quite a bit I mean
okay ten years of PCs that's gonna be
pretty cool display that we're gonna
have mainstage I mean we're gonna be
doing LAN show we're gonna push the win
show to a Saturday so if people want to
see what the windshields like IRL I
wonder if we'll be late I wonder if we
schedule for five it will probably be
late yeah exactly
we've done when show IRL once before
haven't we we did it the first meetup I
think that's right I'm just like four
years ago that was the week that I got
hired that's like the whole thing with
out with LTX is like I got hired in
August of 2015
I think and it was the day we moved to
this new office and I remember you guys
be like here we have a little Meetup and
then the Friday came I started on the
Monday at the Friday came I think 500
people show up in the people yeah the
parking lot people see like my name on a
nametag we were like can I get your
signature I was like you don't know who
I am they're like I don't care it was
really cool though it was awesome to see
everybody here so I mean that's kind of
where it started I guess there's just no
way we know ever do it here again no
like and this was around the time that
Ellen G moved in so our neighbors were
like parking lots just full of people
because we couldn't let them all into
the building for obvious security
reasons like it was such a hot day it
was very very poorly organized it was it
was and that's why this is gonna be a
lot better in four years so learned a
lot there we go exactly but I'm just
gonna see if there's any any like
questions in the chat yeah for sure if
you guys have any questions feel free
maybe even a tweet us if you go at Linus
tech I'm talking what's up
Oh tours are also so that's another
thing to the office to wrist thing I
know that's it's actually completely
separate from LTX but every year that we
have LTX people like oh man can I like
come by the office and like have a tour
and it's like we're not really equipped
for that so this is the one time of year
where if you have an office to her
ticket somebody is going to be here
they're going to guide you through the
office it'll be very organized we can
get more people through the building
without crowding things up and hopefully
completely dismantling all the videos
and stuff that I'm sure we'll need to do
but everyone will be here so if you do
have a ticket you'll get to see kind of
the whole shebang so and hopefully the
Landsteiner will be done by then so you
can take a look at the land center I've
been really cool it'll be done yeah the
Lanson will be done by then oh yeah
well we're just waiting on CPUs right
now basically there we go cool so people
are asking about volunteers how does
that work do they get a free ticket or
what so we're still trying to figure out
the compensation things there's some
like legality things that we're trying
to figure out for volunteers here in
Canada but you will get something so
that will be predetermined it's not like
you'll volunteer and then we'll figure
it out that is part of when I it'll
probably be me follow up with the
volunteers that fill out the form below
we will figure that
before anything so yeah the volunteer
form is restricted at the moment
oh it's restricted that's cool I wish I
could fix that right now Matthew Denton
asks how are we receiving shirts and
lanyards shirts and lanyards yes that'll
be out there that'll be out the event
yeah so there will be a check in there
will be a check-in where you'll go and
you'll pick up your bag I'll be very
clearly marked to flow when you come
into the event of where to go to pick up
the different things so right I was
gonna check Twitter ok tronic asks is
there an ultra membership for full plane
where I can watch all the channels there
no sorry no I can explain in more detail
some other time actually flow plane is
getting pretty close to having like a
launch video like this I mean I
shouldn't say pretty close Luke's gonna
freak out if I use that word but it will
happen eventually and we will explain
how flow plane works everyone's just
inviting pewdiepie Delta XS all their
Twitter feed is right now lots of
questions about volunteers guys guys
will will fix that right after this if
you're interested in it go fill out the
form which will fix right after the
stream and then we will get you guys all
the details perfect
all right cool oh yeah how much your
tickets right now how much your tickets
tickets are did you did you do do do I
just want to make sure I'm actually
correct here okay so for a Saturday one
day pass is thirty bucks that's us
Sunday past 30 bucks two day pass is $50
a b-y-o-see pass which includes a two
day admission LTX is $80 and then the
these are lower than they're gonna be
where's the merch where's the merch one
oh it's an add-on
I think the merch pack is $30 don't
quote like 90% sure on that so you get a
shirt with that you get a lanyard in a
pin I believe so dynami asks will there
be an option for people with VR to join
in with a VR stream I don't want to
promise anything like that right now
interesting yeah we'll see yeah
mr. Pokemon says just bought a
floatplane subscription sweet Adam says
VIPs tickets hold on to minutes yeah we
know like yeah it's one of those things
we're like honestly the only way for us
to keep VI pick VIP tickets from selling
out in a couple of minutes because it's
happened every time would be to charge
like five thousand dollars for them but
that's that stupid seems like then we're
just Skrillex
yeah cuz part of the thing is like this
is all we can do
yeah and we don't want to open up more
tickets because then you're not VIP yes
then you're just at the event in a big
group yeah exactly
so alright buy ticket guys go buy
tickets now and if you guys have any
questions we have any questions at all
hit us up on the forum Twitter Facebook
discourse sorry I have one more question
yeah what's up
if tickets sell out yes in this wave yes
is it gonna show like sold out or is it
gonna say come back later it'll show
that it'll show sold out like all the
tours already say sold out so yeah okay
so you're good but then if people see
sold out in like a week or two from now
yeah they shouldn't panic they should
just wait for the next wave essentially
yes okay okay well we just will we just
open up the next wave early what's
Johnno saying over there well okay yeah
and the number of tickets yeah we will
cross that bridge when we get there okay
all right okay bye guys bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
