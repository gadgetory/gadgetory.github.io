assembled the first case for our Vesta
our one series of systems now like I
said guys they're not perfect and just
to be sort of full disclosure about
everything I'm going to point out all of
the imperfections so there's a little
bit of imperfection in terms of the
overall surface of the case so there's a
little bit of that as a whole I mean
it's a project that the shop were
working with had never approached before
and so I mean when you consider the the
rate that these systems are going for
comparable I guess I haven't talked
about the price yet but we'll do that
later when you consider the rate these
are going for versus on their custom
painted systems I'm sure you guys it'll
be plenty excited about them let's yeah
see so you can see when it's taken apart
it's fairly visible there's you know
like overspray on the insides and things
like this line you know where they're
not going to look great when the case is
disassembled we also have a little bit
of red somehow end up on the drive cages
of this particular one but we haven't
really seen if they're all like that
there's nothing that will be visible or
noticeable when the case is actually
assembled though okay so let's have
let's let's look at it close up so you
can see here we did these side panels
the front grille the top you can see
when you open this up it's actually red
down to the insides here it's like that
way you can really see the reflection on
the glossy finish on this on this case
here here come and have a close look at
the front so we actually took the
Corsair badges off before painting the
case so we could put them back on and
it'd be nice and tidy this side looks
great just a nice straight read side
panel the latches are a nice little
black accent I've seen people complain
about the latches on the Corsair 650d
but in this context they actually look
pretty sharp just being a bit of a black
accent even on this side I'd say the
even better because they're a bit of a
black accent to go along with the trim
around the window to the to the
otherwise stark red finish another case
now I did mention we were going to use
the custom NCIX edition Gatling fans in
the system so you can see up here we've
got our red and black fans installed in
them we're going to be installing more
in the back once we've got the coarser
h7t installed there so thank you for
checking out our pickup and finished
case showcase don't forget to subscribe
to Linus Texas for more videos and stay
tuned for the final pricing and the
final bill that we're going to do of the
vesta r1 system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
