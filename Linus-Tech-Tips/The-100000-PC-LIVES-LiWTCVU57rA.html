we fired 69 part four okay section four
okay try to be less annoying you had a
lot of comments how I saw them here so
here's what went down six workstations
one CPU was a project that I invested
many many many hours of my time into
trying to figure out what it was was it
software was it hardware was it firmware
was it drivers what was causing the
crashes whenever we tried to load up
certain virtual machines in our latest
crazy virtualization project and the
answer it was the hardware I love a soos
loved them very dearly but what I don't
love is this slot and this slot because
they are dirty little slots basically
either they just outright don't work or
they're bifurcation which means taking
sixteen PCI Express lanes and splitting
them out into to 8x lanes so you can
have two separate devices running at 8x
doesn't work but that's okay thank you
Jake you can pack that backup for me
because we have this so back when I
started the project this board didn't
exist this is a dual LGA 3647 socket
motherboard from Ty an it also has
support for 12 memory sticks so we can
put the same 384 gigs of ram on it it
also has 10 gig networking onboard and a
bunch of it's got you dot two connectors
and this one oh look at this is that is
that is it is that 1111 PCI Express
slots so this is gonna be fun because
today we are gonna get it working for
real hopefully
thermal takes a 500 has a modern
minimalistic design brushed aluminum
panels and dual hinge wing tempered
glass doors check it out today at the
link in the video description so to be
clear asu's is actually still working on
a fix for their board by the way massive
shout out to Wendell for helping us
figure out the the bifurcation issue but
in the mean time we did want to try
something else because we want this
project done and tie an claimed when we
contacted them that it would be no
problem in fact they actually had a
couple of words that could work this one
that I showed you which was kind of a
lie because we're not going to use this
one because it doesn't fit in any case
and the one that's actually on the test
bench right behind me here so this is a
standard SSI EE B form factor board just
like that one with the main differences
being that it's only got seven PCI
Express slots just like the Asus port
that we were using it's got three of
these u dot two looking connectors over
there more on that in a moment it's got
its two m dot twos and I mean yeah it
just doesn't have 11 slots like it's
still got six slots for memory and all
of that good stuff so we're basically
ready to rock and I want to walk you
guys through what I have set up here for
those of you who haven't seen this
madness before so in our top slot here
we've got an external PCI Express like
sort of riser card with an extender
cable that runs over to this daughter
board here the reason we want this is
that we want each one of our VMs to have
its own dedicated USB 3 controller so
that if we had to do say for example a
high speed ingest of footage for editing
or whatever else everyone could do that
without running into a system bottleneck
so right now all of these cards if we
were to pin them all at the same time it
might be a little borderline because
this is a PCIe ATX link right here but
if we went 16x which we may be able to
do in the finished one I don't imagine
that would actually be a problem
the last thing over here is a 10 gigabit
networking card but we'd like to go 100
gigabit for the final project so we're
running the same Thermaltake PCI Express
extensions that we were using before
except Jake actually had the ingenious
idea of instead of just stacking the
cards next to the
bench on the table grabbing this old DIY
mining rig that he had lying around and
putting all of our Titan v's on that so
at least something good came out of that
whole mining craze for the rest of the
hardware we've got to ax 1500 i power
supplies just because of the way that
this whole thing hooks up we'll come up
with a better way to do that later and
then we've got the octane 905 PS that we
were planning to use as our boot drives
with these adapters from Utah to to PCI
Express 4x now one small problem and
that is that these while they are
physically the same connector as nvme
you got to it's actually called
sssomething crazy it's a mini SAS HD
yeah that's me SAS HD so this is meant
to be used as a breakout into just for
like SATA connections or a bunch of so
there's no actual PCI Express backing
for this so that's where these MDOT 2
drives come in and maybe we'll do use
adapters to go to these to go to the
other whatever but cross that bridge
when we get to it
the last change is that we're running
Zeon gold cpus because I actually
dropped one of our 8180 Platinum's and
it's got a dead memory channel and so
just for troubleshooting purposes we
wanted stuff that definitely works cool
but there's good news check this out
so here's workstation 1 we're gonna grab
our top Titan v it's a companying sound
card we had to apply the same fixes for
PCI stubbing so that we can get all
these USB cards showing up here as well
as ACS override downstream multifunction
so all that's done just like last time
we're gonna go ahead and fire this up
now this should work and it should show
up over here mind you we had a single V
I'm working just fine on the other one
also we need to make sure that our
daughter board which is some weird weird
friggin hardware is working correctly as
well so it was one of the Renaissance it
must be this one it's this one of this
one
our mouth should light up there's a
50/50 chance that our mouths will light
up it did not but that's okay because
there is still a 50/50 chance just
kidding it should be a hundred percent
actually it's probably less than a
hundred percent it's just a chance it
won't work but it's setting up a device
is it oh I couldn't see that cute device
is ready The Sentinel 3 is ready to go
come on baby anytime mr. Sentinel or
miss Sentinel okay hold on no no we
thought there was a chance this might
happen well it's working
Oh working ha oh hell yeah I was like
less than fifty fifty that this was
gonna work well that's great so then now
we just proceed right anymore
yeah should we just like fire up like a
game or something so here's what we're
gonna do for each one we're gonna name
it we're gonna go ahead and I think
that'll do giving it each one of them a
three core CPU because we don't have a
lot of CPU cores right no I need to
either buy a new one or beg and plead
with Intel to send me a new one which I
strongly suspect they are not going to
want to do because that team and I are
not on the best of terms right now so I
saw in there the CPU mode isn't hosts
pass-through mode so we're using that to
hide the virtualization from the Nvidia
drivers that's yes so they don't give
you that weird error and that's right
because they want you to buy Quadros
yeah so they specifically bacon a
specific error just as a nephew it's not
like we cheaped out you know gb 100's
they're only like 10 grand right you
think they'd send us six of those no
touch me what wait what is that
Oh what the hell was that another VM
well which one is that what's going on
here which one did you just turn up
turn on yeah you just turned one on wait
what does Windows 10 what is this one
I don't know so this is great it's
actually Wendell to the rest region or
at least his community over on level one
Tech's forum so what it is is that we
had assigned the USB device to one of
the VMS then booted that up shut that
down tried to assign it to another one
and then boot that up and some devices
have an issue where they'd like they
don't get fully let go of we had this
problem with the Radeon r9 nanos or
whatever those things were called from
the original seven gamers one CPU where
if we had a crash in one of the VMS we
would actually have to completely reset
the entire host in order to reboot the
VM because of just the way that AMD's I
believe it was a firmware issue in that
particular card was implemented so we're
just gonna go one at a time we're gonna
take it slow baby slow hands snow chance
okay there's one got my pointing finger
ready wait there it is I had my boss
that didn't have my pointing finger
ready anymore okay
two three
there comes number four oh I want to
back up I don't want to get in the way
of that too much horsepower as you can
see the graphics drivers are loaded like
that was our problem we were able to
light up lots of VMs before but now like
but they're not crashing and the
graphics drivers are loaded like they're
running at the right resolution it's
working device manager uh display
adapters yeah okay
all right all right it's got a table oh
wow that's my toe okay so this is not a
great table it's like three quarters of
a desk that's a budget cuts you know
it's January
you know how the YouTube ad revenue
that's everything gets slashed in all
seriousness though
we're just using these like hobby board
pieces we're making our own tabletops we
think this is gonna be for the upcoming
land center so this is like the first
prototype we've got these raising desk
sheep what well relatively look at the
Lord I mean they were inexpensive yeah
that's a that's a yeah bad use of words
isn't this crazy why would you ever need
a desk this tall maybe if you're like
seven feet tall
yeah yeah okay okay I'm putting it
because we're gonna cover this in
keyboards and mice where all the
keyboards and mice for this project also
how are we gonna plug into USB it's way
over there so I'm saying we unplug all
the power things because we could just
leave that power supply there and just
move our board over there yeah hell yeah
stop all kill everything with fire shut
her down
use your pointy finger how do you do
that so well there you go that was a
little better getting the hang of it
it's not as easy as it looks okay are
they all doing it I mean presumably
they're all running on the same image
this board is so trippy like it takes a
24 pin 5 and then 5 8 pins are they all
EPS yeah who the hell has five EPS
connect like what servers see that's the
thing though what server has a modular
power supply and know what server has
five EPS connectors on I don't know but
I think have to be purposeful the Tesla
V 100's have EPS connectors they don't
have PCH I know they do it's a single 8
pin and then you can adapt to PCIe 8
pins into one EPS a pin that's madness
yeah ok there you go so you need all
your power connectors in there and it's
like very professionally mounted
top-quality I know how much you love
these fans that are just literally in
here as spacers and not even plugged in
yeah man
got to use noctua for everything I can't
wait to order the cable mod kit for this
build
ha ha Thomas is gonna be like what do
you need $1,200 of cables for ok ah hit
it with my best shot I love it this
these tie on boards they have onboard
power buttons for like bench operation
so 250 times 6 is 1500 Wow I think these
aren't these more than 250 you don't
sound very certain about any of this at
this man so I'm not really listening
anywhere I'm googling here let's ask
Google why don't we go get the keyboards
in nice that mean how many watts is a
Titan V we have 110 teraflops of watts
how many key parts do we need o 4 5 5
where did all the keyboards bill you
can't even hear him it doesn't matter if
they're racks
this is just for testing karat all right
I'm coming what is this you said grab
random ones oh I can't type on this
chair okay this doesn't work oh why is
it still a thing that's like I don't
know it's sentimental
there was me grabbing actual keyboards
no Jake you don't need to grab actually
reversal on these are broken Oh doesn't
matter it doesn't matter
looks like the budget cuts are really
hurting us here we're short on space so
I I don't know which is which right now
so what I look kind of thinking are they
actually plugged in properly no hello
Dennis
wild Venice appears so I don't know how
but we somehow made this more jank than
your setup I think so hold on a second
which ones one okay so one is the top
let's go one two three four five six
oh god let's just group them all
together just screw it or just let's
make sure we have two on each oash I
plug in the 10k babe
hell yeah let's do it oh yeah somebody's
walking past the basketball hoop a
little confused what what's that for it
okay is this in like some kind of a mode
where for whatever reason H is volume
down do you not have enough disk space
oh god how big are these disks uh uh oh
no not huge try just uninstall premier
you can do whatever you want it's a free
country
yeah wait what no don't run the stuff
from you as a pain in the ass so
theoretically all we have to do is pop
open Disk Management now and extend
volume boom boom boom and bippity
Boppity we're steam big volume it's open
it's beautiful so what are we using
Cisco cache right so this is why the
steam catch it's pretty great right so
we've got that one going at 40 that one
going at 40 there's some other ones
presumably that's the only one pulling
off the steam cash but how do you know
well cuz that's the only one I
configured to pull up the steam cash why
do you need to configure it I thought
our DNS settings are just I don't think
we did in the rotor I thought you did
yes I wasn't me it wasn't me
hey there we go see it was using the
cache 40 40 40 40 nice
oh my back is back this one's at 70 50
that's looking hot if you're into that
sort of thing
so when we do put the land center over
there we'll be able to all download
games that like Cisco hell yeah hell
yeah so now we have like updates all
these people does Windows Update - right
you play origin or you know I don't I
don't know people got to have a bad time
okay guys come on over I have a primo
primo gaming experience for you guys six
workstations one CPU is officially
working we haven't quite worked out the
logistics of the keyboards and mice
these are all bought matches so everyone
feel free to find a keyboard and mouse
and figure out what the crap screen
you're running on oh and that one
you said it's premium we're we're
actually marketing people so if we don't
know yeah we're primo this is primo
we're gonna kill ya and the audio is a
little bit messed up because we don't
know which source this monitor in
particular is pulling audio from we can
actually have a look at our CPU usage
here so you can see the course that I
have assigned I left a core one alone so
cores 2 to 18 or a sign and you can see
we're sucking up anywhere from 70 50 to
as high as 90% usage on these cores
playing cs:go so this is good enough but
there would be games that would be more
demanding where we'd run into trouble so
it's working this is crazy exciting but
the next stage is productivity so we
need higher-end networking we need
faster boot drives we're gonna move to
op teen and we're gonna try to edit 8k
video on all six of these workstations
at once but this is a good start master
ops sennheiser HD 6 xx headphones are
some of their best selling of all time
with over 60,000 units sold and I can
see why because they have an unchanged
driver and sound structure compared to
the HD 650 s meaning that you get a nice
balanced mid-range and natural sounding
bass they've added a detachable 6 foot
cable instead of a 10 foot cable based
on community feedback and they come with
an 8 inch plug that's versatile for
everyday use and a quarter inch adapter
you also get long-term support from
Sennheiser so check out the link today
to join the drop now so thanks to Jake
forgetting this working tie-in for
having a motherboard that works properly
and you guys for watching and we dislike
this video oh and Wendell hey if you
guys dislike this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description
also down there is our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join this is clearly the most ergonomic
gaming setup of all time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
