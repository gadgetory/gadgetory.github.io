custom water cooler click now to learn
more latency or leg is the delay between
an action and the resulting reaction
such as in gaming the pressing of a
button on a controller and the
corresponding animation of a character
on the screen this latency is an enemy
of gamers it makes controls feel less
responsive and makes it more difficult
to among other things time jumps and
land headshots there are many smaller
contributors that make up the total
latency in the example I just gave
ranging from one's small enough to not
matter such as the delay between
pressing a button on your wired keyboard
and that action being registered by your
computer all the way up to image
processing delays as high as sixty eight
milliseconds or at three to four frames
of action on a sixty Hertz TV today's
investigation is not a detailed look
into the contribution of every single
one of these leg factors but rather a
look at the current state of local game
streaming technology and whether it's a
feasible alternative to plugging
directly into a PC or game console now
when I say local game streaming I am NOT
referring to subscription-based cloud
services like online that's internet
game streaming and has a whole different
set of challenges because it relies on
your internet connection that means
latency is higher and beyond your
control and it also means that like
Netflix it will use your monthly
bandwidth quota if your internet service
provider has one local game streaming by
contrast uses only your own networking
equipment which can be as cheap or as
fancy as you want does not require a
subscription since your games belong to
you already and does not use your
internet connection because both the
games serving PC and the client PC or
device are within your own network so
here's our setup our streaming computer
for all the tests is using a core i7
3770k CPU with eight gigs of RAM and a
GTX 780 Ti so the very high-end machine
but in order to reduce the variables in
our test it was important to use a
gaming computer that is easily capable
of powering these in-home streaming
solutions for networking we're using an
Asus RTN 66u which is the best consumer
grade router that i've personally used
for game stream and of course it has
gigabit connectivity for our wired
examples for our clients we're using a
steam OS machine as well as an Nvidia
shield to show off those two different
streaming solutions so to get started
we're going to plug both a CRT monitor
and an Asus PB 270 Q into a PC in chrome
display mode for a local gaming session
we're using counter-strike sources in
game benchmark to simulate our local
gaming session because it's really quick
to launch and it has an explosion that
changes the color of the whole frame
very suddenly and predictably we were
able to consistently measure a 10 to 11
frame difference when filming at 480
frames per second between the first
bright flash of fire on the CRT and the
first appearance of it on the LCD that
gives us about a 22 millisecond delay
this methodology unfortunately doesn't
give us the exact input lag of the
monitor but since most people won't
notice the difference between a CRT and
an LCD it does allow us to make relative
comparisons between the contenders while
giving us some context for the following
numbers first up we're going to test
steams in-home streaming you can find
more details about in-home streaming in
the link in the video description and to
do that we're going to take our LCD and
run it off of our steam machine a normal
PC that is connected via a wired Gigabit
Ethernet connection to the same network
as our gaming PC the gaming PC keeps the
CRT so that we can measure the
additional delay that is caused by the
h.264 video encoding being done by the
server PC the network transfer and then
the decoding being done by the client PC
it looks like it adds about 74
milliseconds compared to a CRT monitor
which is about equivalent
seeing your game with a four and a half
frame delay on a sixty Hertz monitor not
bad when you consider that there are TVs
that can add as much as sixty eight
milliseconds or about three to four
frames but you also need to remember
guys a leggy display will further
increase the perceived latency so while
it's playable in this situation there's
still a lot of room for improvement and
one to two frames would be ideal just in
case you hook it up to one of those
extremely laggy TVs in scenario two
we're going to use Nvidia's proprietary
game stream technology with a shield
handheld Android gaming system to see
how close it comes to valves more open
solution
Nvidia's advantage is that due to its
closed ecosystem they can keep tight
control over the data chain and fully
leverage their own technologies such as
the built-in hardware h.264 video
encoders and decoders on their graphics
processors however in videos
disadvantage here is that they're
running wirelessly that's how they
advertise games dream Nvidia also has
the benefit of tightly controlling the
settings at which games can run and they
allow only a maximum of 720p 60fps
compared to the 1080p 60fps that we were
able to run with a wired connection on a
steam in-home streaming setup so game
stream adds about well about the same 74
milliseconds compared to our CRT which
seems pretty good considering that it's
Wireless because it's wireless though it
is subject to interference and you won't
get that 74 millisecond delay
consistently since you won't always be
right next to the router the way that we
are for our controlled testing scenario
three addresses and imbalance in the
previous two examples by taking our
steam machine and turning it down to
720p 60fps then running it wirelessly so
it's more equivalent to the shield
the ACC 87 I deluxe motherboard that's
running in here has onboard dual band AC
Wi-Fi which should be mad basically
equivalent to the dual band n Wi-Fi on
the shield because we're connecting to
an N access point going Wireless with
steam in-home streaming ads about
there's that number again 74
milliseconds compared to our CRT
so performance was pretty much the same
as the shield in terms of leg eNOS and
very playable but not something that I
would actually recommend doing shield
runs on a small built-in display we only
used the HDMI output to go to our bigger
one to control the variable of the
displays input legs so that we got
comparable results so compressed 720p
images will normally still look really
good and really sharp on that time
little display but for something bigger
like you'd be running on a steam machine
like a TV or a monitor I would really
recommend a wired connection so you can
gain at 1080p scenario four is an open
source streaming app called
limelight that keeps getting brought up
to me whenever I talk about in-home
streaming solutions it works yes but I
hope this video serves as a
demonstration of why I don't talk about
it much yet and why I don't care about
it much yet it works on pretty much any
reasonably powerful Android device which
is really cool but it's just not even in
the same ballpark as the others and in
my experience does not provide a
playable experience on either of the
supported devices I own an Nvidia shield
and an HTC One our measured latency was
about 98 milliseconds but unfortunately
the image quality was lower than any of
the other solutions with more frequent
unplayable stutters in my testing so in
summary the best streaming solutions we
have are tripling the delay that you
experienced when you upgraded from a CRT
to a good-quality LCD but in that time
their encoding an image sending it over
a network then decoding it 74
milliseconds of display leg is
noticeable but it's definitely playable
for most John reserved games I actually
beat the first couple worlds of super
meatboy streaming on my shield I'll be
it not as easily as I can when hooked up
directly with a wired controller but I
was able to do it a hundred milliseconds
becomes too much to deliver a
satisfactory game experience for
anything but slow-paced perhaps
turn-based gaming for me and while
you're sensitive
a very the takeaway today is that gaming
on the machine you're directly attached
to is still better we're talking 22
milliseconds compared to about 75 so
we're talking about a 3x betterness
improvement even with an LCD monitor
compared to a CRT vs. streaming it's
still the best but quality local game
streaming solutions are adding about
another 50 milliseconds of leg which
means that we can achieve very playable
results today if we control the
additional latency introduced by other
parts of the chain such as wireless
gaming controllers or leggy TVs and in a
generation or two if encoder and decoder
Hardware can be improved we could be
able to get pretty close to the
performance of sitting in front of the
device which is extremely exciting the
future is going to be awesome folks I
hope you enjoyed this video like it if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it leave a comment and let me know
what's your sensitivity like did you
really notice when you went from CRT to
LCD do you notice the difference from
one LCD to another because I certainly
do and have you tried in-home streaming
or Nvidia shield with its game stream
technology and did you find it very
playable would love to hear from you
guys and I'm sure I have a standard
intro but I've completely forgotten it
now don't forget to subscribe peace
