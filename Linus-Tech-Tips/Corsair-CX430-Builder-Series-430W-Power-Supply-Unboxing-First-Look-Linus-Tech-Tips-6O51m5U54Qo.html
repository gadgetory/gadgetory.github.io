supply from Corsairs builder series
which I have never had a look at in the
past this is the CX 430 and by Builder
series what I'm assuming they mean is
that it is ideal for building a system
around it okay so there it's a nope no
frills no gimmicks just straight this is
a decent power supply go ahead and use
it to power a system that you need to
run for a long time sort of approach to
things so let's see what Corsair has to
say for themselves on the back it is
ideal for home and office use okay and
worryfree compatibility for your home
desktop for your upgrading all that good
stuff Quick Start Guide build a series
with more than 15 years of building and
50 it's a single rail power supply which
is pretty nice to see because it's a 430
watt range you do send tend to start
seeing dual rail power supplies now
while I'm not a huge fan of a single
rail power supply all the way up until
like the kilowatt ranges I do like to
see single watt power supplies on the
low end units and the reason for that is
because a low end unit with two split
12-volt rails with a very low overall
rating on the 12 volts overall low
overall rating overall yeah with a low
overall reading on 12-volt rails as soon
as you split them you're gonna run into
trouble where if you have even like a
decent graphics card or you want to put
like a high-end graphics card in it even
though the 430 you want would be enough
to power it sometimes you might run into
trouble where one of the rails is
getting overloaded so that was a long
and drawn-out way of saying I'm really
glad to see it has a single 12 volt rail
in here we find some Quick Start Guide
ish type stuff and that's pretty much it
and then yeah yeah this is pretty much
no frills although they do include
sleeve cables which is really nice to
see on a value unit like this we've got
a power cord we've got to us and do not
eat presumably some screws yet we've
bought screws and even some zip ties so
four screws to a fix to the case zip
ties as well as a powered by Corsair
sticker in there so that's pretty nice
and then
and here we'll untether the cables and
find out exactly what kind of
connections we have because if you're
talking about a power supply that's just
kind of for your value builder they're
going to be concerned with things like
well exactly what can i hook up to this
thing as you can see right away it's
quite small so even though it does have
a 120 millimeter fan it still it still
even looks kind of like like it looks
even more huge than normal on this
particular unit because it's actually
shorter than it is why most power
supplies are sort of more square so you
can see right here the warranty is void
if you remove this sticker and open up
the casing you should never open up a
power supply unless you're a qualified
professional
here we see some course our branding on
the side the general specs of the psu
itself are here so we've got 28 amps on
the single 12 volt rail it's capable of
providing 336 Watts of the overall 430
Watts that this power supply can support
now you see high-end systems or high end
power supplies that really lean heavily
towards the 12 volt rail where they'll
be able to provide almost their entire
power through the 12 volt rail that kind
of thing is not really necessary on the
low end PSU like this because you're not
going to be running high-end graphics
cards which are really the ones that
suck up a lot of 12-volt juice so on the
back we find the power switch as well as
a power plug you can see inside some of
the coils some of the heat sinks all of
that good stuff actually if I flip it
over this way you'll be able to see
inside a lot better yeah that's way
better okay so let's have a look at what
connectors we have on this guy first of
all we have your standard 24 pin power
connector we do have a breakaway 4 pin
here so you can plug it into a 20 pin
board whether you're using an ITX board
or an older board because that's really
what this is targeted at if you have an
older system you need to replace the
power supply you want something good
reliable and go with something like this
here is a
yes success we have four plus four pin
so that's an eight pin or a four pin
power connector for the motherboard and
then we have a single PCI Express and
this is kind of nice to see look at that
we've got a PCI Express six plus two so
not only can you power a single
mid-range graphics card if they ever do
change the standard to a single eight
pin on on like mid-range graphics cards
we're going to be ready for that as well
now in terms of other connectors we've
got a hot so we have three molex four
pins as well as one floppy connector and
then on two separate cables and this is
smart because most of the time when
you're building a new system you're
going to have your optical drive
somewhere and then your hard drives like
kind of somewhere else so this allows
you to plug in two optical drives
together and then two hard drives
together which is really on like a 430
watt powered system going to be pretty
much all you're going to see so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
CX 430 don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips and that's it this whole
time I was trying to find the warranty
for the thing because I mean Corsairs
big thing with their power supplies is
they're super reliable they have their
legendary customer and technical support
which I can personally vouch for because
I have used it anyway this particular
unit unlike the high-end units which
carry five and even seven year
warranties has a two year warranty so
that was just something I wanted to add</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
