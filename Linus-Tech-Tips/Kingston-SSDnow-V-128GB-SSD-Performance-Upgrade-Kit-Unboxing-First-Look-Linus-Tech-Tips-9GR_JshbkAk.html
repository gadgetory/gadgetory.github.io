i unboxed their SSD navi series notebook
upgrade kit drive very recently and now
I have the SSD now v+ series 128
gigabyte performance upgrade kit so this
is intended for a desktop computer
whereas this one it is intended for a
notebook computer so there are some key
differences first of all the v+ series
is slightly faster as the plus would
indicate and next of all it includes
slightly different accessories so rather
than including say for example an
external hard drive enclosure and
cloning software the desktop performance
upgrade drive includes I don't know
actually we're about to find out what it
includes though it does include an
enclosure cone it does include cloning
software Wow so it actually just
includes more it also includes a three
two and a half to three and a half inch
hard drive mounting adapter bracket it
includes the USB cable that you'll need
for the enclosure it includes a SATA
cable which you will need to install the
new SSD in your system unless you're
replacing an SSD or rather a SATA drive
and then you've got the kingston
enclosure which is just a simple simple
external us being closer so you just
kind of throw your drive in there and
then you close it up and you slide that
on there yeah you lock it up and then
you've got just a basic USB 2.0 external
hard drive enclosure so if you're
upgrading well if you are upgrading a
laptop you can throw your old drive in
here and use it as a storage drive and
then leave the SSD in your laptop
because there's no reason you couldn't
use this in a laptop too now the main
advantages of an SSD that kingston has
asked me to mention are the silence the
reliability and the performance I mean
does it do is there really anything else
yeah the capacities aren't as big as a
typical two and a half inch hard drive
which is available and up to about 500
gigs these days but I mean at 128 gigs
you've got enough space to store pretty
much whatever you'd need and it's much
much faster like an SSD just smokes even
any desktop drive even in a raid
configuration the
it's all about the little bits of data
that you're accessing frequently that's
why they're so useful as an OS drive
because whenever you do anything it's
gonna be much snappier I actually did a
long convoluted video on SSD versus hard
drive if you put SSD space vs space HDD
into the YouTube search it should bring
up my video under my NCIX comm channel
pretty pretty high up and I show real
world an SSD vs. a hard drive and it
just flies so this is like I said there
V plus series actually why don't we have
a quick look at some what kind of specs
we've got on this particular drive
they're not gonna let me cheat they have
nothing on the box you know what why
don't we find out in real time the
actual difference between the SSD now V
Series and the SSD now V plus series
will cite and we'll just keep them in
and find out what the differences so
Kingston calm okay today we're gonna be
learning how to do important product
research okay so you can see there's the
e series so that's basically irrelevant
these days this is the old based on the
Intel X 25 II then you got the M series
which is based on the Intel X 25 M and
then the V and V plus series these are
both using Toshiba controllers as I
recall so why don't we have a look at
the V Series first so you got the
datasheet here and what is it going to
tell us about it
well my a scroll wheel is not working
okay here we go so the sequential speed
on the 128 gig is 200 megabytes per
second read and 160 megabytes per second
write I do they have any random Oh this
is kind of a neat they give you the PC
mark hard drive hard drive score from
2005 so it looks like the 64 gig is the
best control it's the best performer out
of these the V Series drives so why do
we have a look at the V Plus series
drives so you've got slightly higher
sequential read as well as slightly
higher sequential write that's actually
very impressive for writes and then you
vac
Julie got dramatically higher
performance this I was not aware of so
it looks like the v+ is pretty much the
way to go if you are looking for the
maximum performance whereas the V is
more of a value or into drive why don't
we have a look at what these two drives
actually cost on NCIX I get a lot of
questions about this where I work I work
at NCIX it's a computer store in Canada
some Kingston 128 gigabyte all right
let's see what we bring up so we've got
the V Series Gen 2 128 gig so that is at
2 49.99
and then the V + 128 gig so you're
paying almost an extra hundred bucks for
that performance but if you're looking
for the maximum possible
well performance then you're gonna want
to go with the plus series drive and if
you're not then you're gonna want to go
with the regular V Series Drive so I
think that pretty much covers everything
I wanted to say and why don't I just
sort of briefly show you the difference
in the in the package for the notebook
upgrade kit versus the death kit so
you've got the same enclosure you've got
the same cloning software and the
cloning software is intended for you to
easily take either a desktop or laptop
hard drive so they've included a SATA
cable as well as their their little
basic two and a half inch enclosure you
clone all of your data over to the SSD
drive and then just swap it in you don't
even have to reformat your OS so this
will this is weird this one comes with a
SATA power cable and this one comes with
a SATA data cable
I guess the assumption I don't know what
the assumption is here but they both got
the USB cable they both come with a hard
drive and it looks like there's no hard
drive in here anymore I musta also done
something with it maybe I left it in
here okay that almost freaked me out
there but yeah it's just in there
so here's the v-series drive ah next to
the v+ series drive and they look pretty
much the same all the differences are
gonna be under the hood although this
one has a black label the v+ so that
probably means it goes faster because
anything with a black like sticker on it
automatically goes faster I mean
especially black and red like black and
red those are performance colors so
it's hard to go wrong performance like
black and red thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the Kingston SSDs the
plus series performance upgrade kit SSD
drive oh yeah don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
