immediately assumed that it's a gimmick
like for example this brush buddy's
Justin Bieber singing toothbrush I mean
it's only fun
but if ultimately when I'm finished my
teeth are no cleaner than if I had saved
seven dollars and gotten a regular one
well when I first heard that a Seuss put
a touchscreen in the touchpad of their
new Zen Book Pro I have to confess that
it triggered my gimmick detector at
least before I used it for a while as
for now well I'll say this it's a lot
better than a worthless gimmick but then
also kind of worse you know what's not a
gimmick though glass wire glass wire is
a firewall that displays your pc's
incoming and outgoing network
connections in real time use offer code
Linus to get 25% off glass wire 2.0
through the link below
the overall design of the Suzanne book
Pro UX 580 GE is a solid b-plus the
brushed aluminum and relatively small
bezels are nice but I just can't shake
the nagging feeling that it looks kind
of like an Inspiron but made from better
materials and making matters worse
compared to Dells professional XPS 15 it
is a fingerprint magnet and the reduced
chassis rigidity makes it feel
significantly cheaper which I mean
fortunately for it it actually is with
that said I can't think of a situation
where I'd be embarrassed to be seen with
the Zen Book Pro I mean whether it's in
an office or a studio or a library it
does a great job of blending in
seamlessly that is at least until your
study mates notice the second display so
there's a standard one up top though it
might not be fair to call it standard
because between its 4k resolution touch
support and factory calibration
everything from consuming to creating
content is a joy as long as you don't
care about HDR and then there's the one
where the trackpad would normally be a
soos is calling their little creation
here the screen pad most of the time it
just acts like a normal trackpad and
actually quite a good one you'd think it
would feel weird but it has a nice soft
touch and a satisfying click in fact
even without a screen under it it would
already be getting a pretty positive
review and then it's got extra
functionality like contextual shortcut
keys and the ability to use it as an
extended display well that should get it
right into a plus territory right hold
on
in some situations it's actually great
the YouTube integration on Chrome puts
ad skipping and a full screen toggle
right at your fingertips quite literally
and it even lets you scrub along the
timeline and this is while keeping most
of the screen free to be used as a
regular trackpad then by contrast
Spotify shouldn't even be list
as compatible I mean you know how most
keyboards have media hotkeys up here at
the top making play pause and track
control a single action well for some
inexplicable reason a soos has removed
those functions and replaced them with
nothing so you can have the pleasure of
executing three actions instead of
pressing one button and then making
matters worse once the Spotify app is
open the touch pad no longer works
meaning that it is literally always
faster and more convenient to just click
on the actual Spotify app and this
problem of not being able to use the
touch pad when in certain apps hampers
the usefulness further for things that
would otherwise be great like the numpad
or calculator which is particularly
annoying given that these are issues
that were solved in the word numpad like
in office programs the numpad works
freakin fantastic but also reveals its
limitations only the numpad + symbol
inserter actually really save you time
and then for power users keyboard
shortcuts like control asks are going to
be the way to go for a very long time
and then finally the lack of features
like macros and equations on the screen
pad meant that we really just didn't get
many opportunities to use it overall
then I don't think the screen pad is a
huge selling point at this moment but at
least if you don't like it there's still
a perfectly usable touchpad like normal
and so I like where asus is going with
this and I hope we continue to see
development on the apps something that
should speed up when they release the
SDK which is coming soon now this is
kind of a funny thing because we're
halfway through this video and I haven't
even gotten to the specs of this machine
on paper the Zen Book Pro is an absolute
beast with a core i-96 core processor a
gtx 1050 TI graphics card 16 gigs of ram
and 512 gigs of nvme storage and at that
price
unfortunately it doesn't touch the
maximum performance of the core I nine
and you know what I'm just gonna come
out and say it
I blame Apple for this a very
unfortunate industry trend like a core
i9 MacBook Pro the Zenbook pro pro right
almost immediately overheats under heavy
load dropping the frequency even below
the base clock of the processor and even
though the temps do get a bit better
when the fans kick in it's still running
well under base clock realistically you
could be better off with a cheaper core
i7 if you want a chassis that's this
slim and the heat problems don't stop
there while you're gaming or even in
some cases while performing mundane
tasks like installing programs the
bottom of this machine would regularly
get uncomfortably hot sometimes close to
50 degrees Celsius making the Zen Book
Pro less of a laptop and more of a desk
tough well yeah I mean not like a
desktop but like the point is it works
better sitting on a on a desk you get
with you guys get what I mean also the
battery life isn't that great that was
supposed to tie into the desk thing desk
top desk okay forget it
so continuing on the dislike train only
the storage is upgradable the webcam is
softer than soft camembert cheese and
the keyboard leaves a fair bit to be
desired it's pretty similar to the one
found on the Dell g3 which is alright in
a budget gaming machine and overall
pretty good but when you compare it to
professional machines from Microsoft
Lenovo and Dell the keyboard on the
Zenbook lacks key stabilization chassis
rigidity and tactile feel which I guess
nicely leads into our conclusion besides
the thermals nothing about the Zen book
is bad in fact the speakers which I
couldn't find another place to talk
about are pretty good but at $2,300 for
our build the only thing that really
stands out against the competitors is
the top-of-the-line Korra
CPU and the screen pad but since the
thermals don't allow the i9 to stretch
its legs and the screen pad needs a lot
of work on the software side before I
would consider it a selling point at
this time the Zen book would probably
need to be more than a couple hundred
dollars less than a surface book - for
me to recommend it
