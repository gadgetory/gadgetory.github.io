brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries we're here at the Nvidia
booth PAX Prime 2013 as you guys may or
may not be able to you know Devine based
on your ultimate powers of whatever you
have Nvidia shield is a huge huge focus
for them here at the show as well as of
course a whole whack load of upcoming
and current titles that feature NVIDIA
GeForce technologies so we're here in
the Nvidia booth they've got a wack ton
of cool stuff that they're showing off
this year but as you guys probably know
if you watch the win show on a fairly
regular basis one of the things I'm
really excited about for the future is
invidious grid technology maybe not
necessarily from the cloud gaming
perspective because I'm in Canada where
internet connections are still basically
Stone Age but from a what this
technology enables perspective so I've
got Andrew fear with me here from Nvidia
to talk to us about this device which is
being shown off here in the public and
I'm just gonna oh yes ok so tell me
about it what is this so this is grid
and so for grid for us is we built
custom-made cloud graphics cards so
instead of putting one chip on a board
we put four and then we put up to three
of those cards in a server so any one of
these servers can have 12 GPUs all
running at once if you imagine a full
rack of this it's about 360 GPUs it can
stream about 720 concurrent users from a
single server Rajko grid and the whole
idea is that we render a game like
normal just rendering a game and then in
real time very very fast we encoded as a
video stream and then you can send it
out to any device you want you can set
it to a tablet a phone a laptop a TV a
shield device so it may enables you to
get gaming pretty much wherever you want
so that's what you guys are showing off
here right all of these shields are
actually legitimately being powered off
of the grid behind me is that correct
that's correct so what we're doing is
we're running a couple servers in the
back here we didn't bring a full rack we
only needed a couple servers but we're
actually streaming the games in real
time so you can walk up to our shield
device we have some of our software
running on there to demonstrate the
technology but you can instantly start
playing one of these games just click a
button and in the back the servers
sit up starts playing the game rendering
and sent it directly to you and so in
terms of frame rates we're not even
going to be talking necessarily about
about paying for a particular graphics
card from a cloud gaming perspective
we're gonna be talking about you almost
walk into well I want it I want sixty I
want a 60 FPS experience period and then
the provider will be able to add more
grids and scale their operation
according to the demand from their users
we kind of think of it as like renting a
Geforce right so some people out there
want to go buy achieve course they want
to go buy in a computer they want to go
buy it in a laptop wherever they want to
do it other people don't have a Geforce
maybe they're not a PC user maybe they
just have a tablet
Grigg let get some the ability to almost
by a chief Brenda chief horse in the
cloud if you say I want to I want to
play dishonored or I want to play you
know I wanna play Assassin's Creed 4 or
I wanna play whatever it is you can now
go rent to GeForce with the cloud get
access all those games played on devices
you would never be playing it before now
let's talk prehistoric Internet again
for a second now something that I
personally get really excited about is
more like a local installation of grid
now I'm not a general consumer I have a
16 terabyte storage server in my house
that has a two thousand dollar rate card
in it so to put that in perspective if I
was the kind of person who was crazy
enough to buy something like a second or
a third or a fourth generation grid and
deploy that or if a land center were to
technically were to deploy that it's
technologically possible correct yeah I
mean there's nothing stopping us right
now for going like a game Saturday I
could easily imagine a game center
buying a couple of servers putting in
their server room and then they don't
need to have you know sixteen computers
lying around they gonna have just
sixteen monitors is very very simple
you know $50 device that was decoding
the video playing cloud gaming obviously
it's possible you know we're talking to
me all about it I think the initial
deployment without gaming receipt
probably more than the national level
for more service providers but it's
certainly I think a couple years down
the road you can see it showing up the
game centers speaking of showing up I
mean is this really that different from
the technology you guys have been able
with the GeForce PC streaming to shield
that we're already I mean it's already
at the consumer then right well in some
ways it is I mean we have you know we
virtualized graphics across solver
different business units so we have a
grid team that focuses
on streaming out high-end professional
applications so if you're a light wave
used your adobe use or whatever you are
we can now stream that we can stream an
entire desktop as a Windows high quality
graphics you know in the home we have
our PC to shield streaming which gives
you basically a virtualized game
streaming your shield device we're
trying to take similar technology we
developed for all those for cloud gaming
and be able to give that an enterprise
level to a service provider so they can
deliver cloud gaming to again any device
you want now my understanding is NVIDIA
has for years
had had a device that is capable of
emulating any OS any geforce card in any
game in order to help you guys optimize
the GeForce experience and in order to
help you guys diagnose drivers is this
sort of an evolutionary step that came
from well if we can build this for
ourselves maybe we can build it for
everyone or was this the goal in the
first place well you know a lot of it is
as you said is we have a lot of
technology that's custom build in-house
to be able to emulate ships before they
go into production I mean in fact the
engineers can tell you that there they
don't make themselves as a hardware
engineer their software engineers right
III create a software program that
emulates my GPU I load it into a giant
datacenter and I run doom it may only
run it one frame per second but at least
I can know that it works
so we developed technology from that
learning how to remote into debug
drivers because we you know what is the
same needs to say the Sun never sets on
the British Empire I mean if you look at
the Nvidia software team the Sun never
sets we've got engineers in the US we
got them in India China Russia Europe
wherever you name it and so the problem
is you have we have these clusters of
data centers where an engineer may need
to say I need to debug this problem over
here right and so some of the technology
that we use to look out how do we do
that we decided you know what we get
real if we can deliver a pretty good
experience for us maybe we could deliver
for consumers and then some of it was
kind of born out about in-house
development and tools we were using just
to build our products phenomenally cool
I'm personally very very excited about
it thank you so much for chatting with
us about this and it's good to see you
again good to see you again too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
