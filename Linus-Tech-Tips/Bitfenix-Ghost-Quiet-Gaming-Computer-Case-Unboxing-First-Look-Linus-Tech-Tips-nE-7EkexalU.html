ghost the funny thing about this ghost
is that you can see it whoa hmm
anyway let's let's have a look at what
BitFenix has to say for themselves about
the ghost need a steel in plastic it's
an ATX form factor case includes some
cooling fans which happen to be Specter
fans and it fits a 240 millimeter
radiator on top uses a nano chrome
surface treatment I'm very excited to
see that as for hot swap ins torch cool
okay
2 USB 3 SuperSpeed ports silencing
material ultra silent 120 millimeter
specter fans included pre modded for
alchemy LED strips now that's cool fits
long graphics cards and has a dual
hinged door design now alchemy LED
strips are actually like the balling
outis
a sliding that you can get these days
because unlike cathodes which have bulky
inverters that go with them and they're
heavy they're hard to mount they fall
off all the time unlike those solutions
LED strips spectres namely are out of
Spectre stuff those are the fans
Alchemy's namely are lightweight they
come with a really high quality 3m
adhesive on them so they don't fall off
and they don't need an inverter they can
plug directly into your power supply and
you can even daisy chain multiple ones
together in order to get very even
lighting throughout your case now uses a
hard foam which I'm going to criticize
right off the bat because things like
this happen however it remains to be
seen if the case managed to survive its
transport or whether it did not so if it
didn't manage to survive then I guess
I'll have to find another one and redo
this unboxing but
okay Oh custom foam though so let's go
ahead and peel off the plastic I'm not
sure if you guys are even going to be
able to hear me because we're using the
we're using the NCIX tech tip camera
today with the microphone so I don't
know how much interference it's picking
up from things like the dub this is this
is kind of funny
one of them's popped out and one of
them's in so when I push on it oh
nevermind it came came this time last
time the dowon's swapped which one was
engaged in which one wasn't so this is
what the heck it oh cool so there's hot
swap here for hold on a sec let's cool
so you can put a two and a half inch or
three and a half inch drive in here and
it has little rubber strips on the
bottom which will protect the PCB on the
bottom of the hard drive and B it will
actually reduce vibrations which can
again cause damage to the hard drive or
the data on it and will cause it to be
loud so I've gone and retrieved a hard
drive which I will put in here like this
and then I will slide like this and
that's it so it's a totally stealthy way
to add an extra three and a half inch or
two and a half inch drive to your system
okay - seal of approval on that idea
because I've seen implementations and
hot swaps on cases that are terrible see
the DFAT five-o just awful okay so let's
have a look at this filter good less
relevant though for a top top intake our
exhaust because usually you want that to
be exhaust heat does tend to rise you've
got lots of different options for fans
here so you can do one for idiot this
looks like almost this looks like either
a 160 or a 140 or something I don't know
what this is but it's bigger it's bigger
than normal it looks like they've
actually put in mounting holes for
house.if okay so they've given you a lot
of different options but the 120s are
offset and this is really smart because
it allows you to install a dual radiator
start up here and then the fans on the
bottom so it doesn't actually take up
any space away from where you need you
know your motherboard or your or your
CPU three or your CPU block to be and
that's important because a lot of cases
have roomful dupe for duel fans but as
soon as you try to stack a radiator and
fans it gets pretty thick and it'll
interfere with things like the MOSFET
coolers on your motherboard or your CPU
heatsink or whatever else you have there
so they've got this compartment up here
so you can store the radiator way you
can see they've cut out the ends here
which leaves room for the barbs and the
tubing to come out of the radiator
although usually I'd probably orient it
the other way because otherwise this fan
might get in the way depending on I
might be might fit it might just make it
okay so let's go ahead and okay it looks
like it didn't quite make the air
shipment unscathed all the way from Asia
to here so it looks like one of these
one of these thumb screws got whacked
and dented the back of the side panel a
little bit I'd say that's fairly minor
as far as things being air shop air
shipped across the ocean go so yeah I've
seen I've seen much worse
there's our sound dampening material on
the inside gives some rigidity to the
side panel that it otherwise wouldn't
necessarily have and looks good sounds
good neat okay so side panels off side
panel is pretty plain no ventilation
holes or anything like that with the
ghosts they're going for more of well
silence as you may or may not have
figured out based on the sound deadening
material and the fact that it doesn't
have you know room for a bunch of
blowing fans over top of the video cards
or anything like that on the inside
speaking of the inside um I haven't
actually seen the inside yet so let's go
ahead no no we're not done with the
outside yet right
here at the front we've got our LEDs so
there's your power and your hard drive
your front audio your two USB two two
USB three power and reset switches nice
and recessed so you won't accidentally
hit that one and the front features a
dual hinge design you got your BitFenix
logo which i think looks pretty nice so
you can actually open it this way to
find the three five and a quarter inch
and one three and a half inch Bay the
filtered front intake quite solidly
built to actually very nice and a bit
Phoenix Spectre 120 millimeter fan with
room for another one this is smart haha
check this out
perforations in the hard drive cage I
have actually not seen this before
but you hear people complain that you
know oh well there's a fan here but by
the
time you put hard drives in here you're
not even going to be able to push any
air through it now I mean it might not
be a lot but it'll be more than most
cases smart yo you can also see the
ventilation so from this angle I hope
you can see through here where some of
the air flow will actually be coming in
to feed these front fans because
otherwise they wouldn't be getting
anything because the front of the case
again more perforations here is using
sound deadening material and is
completely flat what you're trying to
see something I don't know what he's
trying to see probably the fan check
this out though
BAM I don't know what just knows that
give me a sec so cameraman is not sure
why you would want to be able to open
either side of the case and personally
I'm not a huge fan of the whole double
hinge design although it's oh yeah right
I put the little thing back in here so
it's fine now but it's implemented
better here than I've seen in the past
and more durably in fact as well but I
still a couple things that I don't have
hold on oh it locks or something okay
hold on okay I get it now actually this
is smarter than I thought okay so the
other main case is the Corsair 550d that
one has a double hinge front panel and
it's not that durable because it's
permanently double hinged this one is
smarter because it allows you to put the
case on either side you want and then
these pieces are actually for locking it
to the particular orientation you want
so you can hear so without these pieces
in it can be double hinged okay and then
if you take these pieces here and put
them in then they are a lock and it will
no longer whoops if you can actually get
them in there we go
and it will no longer open on that side
unless you force it like I did before
thinking that it was just a double
hinged case so there you go you guys
won't make the same mistake as me and
let's just slide this back in so you can
see some stuff did come unseated in
shipping but by and large the case did
make it to us so alright so that's
that's pretty good okay one two three
four five six seven PCI slots so you're
not going to be fitting any XL ATX
motherboards but you will fit you know
your normal full-size ATX micro ATX MITx
should you want to put one of those in
here but I don't see the point of that
if you have mitx you should get a bit
Fenix prodigy instead just like the
coolest case that everyone's excited
about okay on the bottom you've got lots
I didn't take options so you can have to
do 120 mil or 140 mm meter fan from the
bottom using a filtered intake that
apparently goes in from I have no idea
how this how this gets in or out of here
oh it's magnetic baller okay cool there
you go
filtered intake BAM and then lots of
room for your power supply to take air
supports for your power supply if you
have a longer power supply you've got
one two three four three and a half inch
bays there one two three dedicated two
and a half inch SSD bays tool is five
and a quarter inch bays lots of cable
management holes and enough cable
management room now this isn't the most
ample space I've seen in the back of a
motherboard tray before but it's about
an inch so there is sufficient room to
run a 24 pin cable without actually not
being able to close the side panel which
is one of those things you run into it's
very very frustrating so I'm going to go
ahead and have a look at what they've
got for internal connectors you can see
most of them are black however the front
panel connectors are color-coded I'm a
big fan of all black internal connectors
but I'll give it a pass if most of them
are black and then there's just a couple
that aren't so you can see the SATA
connector as well as the SATA power
connector for that front SATA dock are
both black it's got proper internal USB
three pins pin header out whatever plug
okay for the internal header plug for
the internal header as well as a USB to
lead that comes off of it so you can
even just cut this off if you're not
going to use it no big deal alright
we've got a dedicated USB to lead for
those USB 2 ports front panel audio as
well as your front panel whoops your
front panel connectors which are all red
and black now that's odd if you're going
to
color codes and color code them and then
if you're not going to color code them
make them black so that would be my
feedback to Specter fans are included
the one in the front and the one in the
back although there is space for one two
three four five six fans natively
without any changes whatsoever
huge CPU cutout tray so you'll be able
to install your CPU cooler without
removing the board from the case and
that will save you some time lots of
cable management holes let's have a look
at what they've included in terms of the
accessories here so here's your rubber
grommets as well as all your screws
bunch of thumb screws manual okay here
are your two and a half inch hard drive
sleds for SSD whichever you prefer I
mean you could you can use Momentis X
T's in a desktop system no reason you
can't very high performance solution
alright and then there's your three and
a half inch drive sleds
it's an odd I wonder if the production
cases are going to come with these not
pre-installed like this I guess if it
saves them a little bit of labour and
doesn't actually take the end user very
long to install then it could be a
benefit to everybody but there you go
so those slide in just like that and
these ones can also support two and a
half inch devices as well so you can see
there's two and a half inch holes there
and lots of room with the honeycomb
design for cooling for the hard drives
that are installed in them as well so
