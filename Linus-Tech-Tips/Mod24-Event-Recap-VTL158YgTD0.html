a 24 hour like live PC modding yeah
building extravaganza yeah spectacular
event event yeah that's what it was and
we actually had a number of you reach
out asking us to do some kind of a recap
of the event now we don't have all the
footage from it so uploading the 24-hour
archive isn't really an option but what
we do have is some footage of the
finished systems so we were thinking
we'd do a quick overview of the third
second and first place systems and kind
of talk about the event as a whole
yeah or as an event because it wasn't a
whole yeah like not a literal whole
corsair gaming RGB keyboards feature
precision cherry on X RGB key switches
for sixteen point eight million color
perky backlighting for virtually
unlimited customization click now to
learn more mod 24 for me was at least at
the start co-hosting with Linus and then
by the time we were most of the way
through it turned into like just
clearing the way for Linus's zombie walk
to be able to be successful so I had to
just make sure that I could manage where
cameras were gonna be so that by the
time he got somewhere he could just
continuously talk and it would be fine
so that he could go and pass out for
short little like 20 minute windows
regain a tiny amount of energy and then
keep going
well I think it would have been easier
if because I thought the original
concept was we were gonna kind of be
sitting in chairs yeah and then we'd be
looking at footage just coming from
elsewhere commentating on it that's what
I thought it was too but instead we
ended up running all over the place you
know coordinating a lot of it I mean the
team there was great oh yeah they were
awesome but we were kind of going okay I
think they're doing this out in the in
the atrium so you camera guy come with
me let's go Luke you do this rock here
and then we'll talk about the security
thing in fear when we're gonna flip
and something will happen and it'll work
and when we were really organized Luke
and I would go to two different places
and then we would we would tagged him
off and we'd throw the camera to each
other and that only happened a couple
times yeah no way too much I think the
coolest thing about it was being there
with all these people who's builds I've
seen on the Internet
and it's actually seeing them work in
person even if you know the quality of
what they could do in 24 hours it's
obviously not going to be the same as
what they could do in months which is
what a lot of them are doing outside of
this event yeah so I guess we'll start
with team kill ninja this is rich Sora's
and Travis jank rich probably better
known by his alias Darth Beavis lots of
famous builds for him I had really high
expectations for these guys but I really
wasn't sure about their choice of an
open-air flow test bench style case I
think that came because they have very
very recently done a build in that exact
same test bench with a very similar
style IQ to external reservoirs the same
radiator placement all that kind of
stuff so if they were coming into a 24
hour build being able to build on a
platform that they knew probably helped
quite a bit but then they did throw in a
bit of a monkey wrench in terms of
things that they know and my
understanding is that that laser cutting
machine that they were using to make
their decals they had only had for about
a week about a week yep yeah they had
not had it for very long at all they
were while we were there they were
learning how to work with different
types of acrylics in terms of different
colors and different densities and
everything and like how something would
react if it was reflective you'll notice
a lot of the decals on the side of the
case are actually the kind of a
reflective metal look yeah instead of
like a clear blue and I think it worked
really well for some of them I think you
and I both agree that the tighten the
main tighten the centerpiece of the
system worked really well yeah and the
pilot worked pretty well but I think
some of them either didn't come out as
clearly I think the ships are a good
example of this yeah and then some of
them it was more of a placement issue
the guns under the reservoirs are kind
of hard to see and the middle of both of
them is basically entirely chopped off
from most angles because of that
reservoir so it just kind of looks odd
and I mean I think that if they'd had
more time if they had
had to spend so much time working on the
decals themselves they could have come
up with a more polished build I mean the
thing that really hurt them was they had
planned a bunch of lighting effects for
the main Titan the centerpiece that was
supposed to tie in the you know favorite
gaming experiences theme and then they
never actually managed to eliminate him
so they had tried but I don't think they
had kind of enough time and this was
also kind of a newer thing for them just
like the laser cutter they hadn't done
it a ton in the past and speaking of
time they also had the problem with
their coolant coloring yeah this was
right near the end right as everything
was winding down and Darth Beavis tried
to mix colors together to make a
cool-looking Orange which probably
actually would have played together with
the build a lot better but didn't have
enough time to squirt anything in other
than pink right so it made his
previously white which looked kind of
fine coolant turned to this crazy
vibrant pink which well some people
liked it was pretty polarizing and
didn't work super great with the judges
well I think that whoever gets this
system when they've had more time to
polish it and finish it up before
sending it out is gonna end up with
something that's a pretty different
looking experience than what they live
to do in 24 hours definitely I think
that's gonna be a fairly common theme
for all the builds but this one
especially mainly due to the color of
the coolant and possibly the elimination
of the Titan team Mongoose made up of
Lee Harrington and Ron Lee Christiansen
had a kind of uh I'd say they had the
simplest overall game plan yeah they
were the only ones that took a real case
and then they picked a theme that would
fall kind of sort of into any of the
three that Nvidia might throw at them at
the time of the competition and they had
that white board that had their entire
plan every half an hour little half an
hour slots and everything so they knew
exactly what they had to be done by
different parts of the contest and
everyone smiled we check up with them
they say yeah we've we've now cut all of
our was that styrene yeah we've cut all
of our styrene so we know we know we're
ahead of schedule now or whatever they
they always seems like they're ahead of
schedule speaking of cutting styrene I
really didn't have much hope for this
build
the beginning it looked like Lee didn't
seem to really have much to do until the
liquid cooling started and it seemed
like Ron was spending a lot of time
cutting out little white pieces of
styrene and it was hard shaving them in
different ways and was hard for me to
visualize what that was gonna turn into
but once he started painting them end up
looking absolutely fantastic he's
obviously very skilled with an airbrush
and this this case just looks really
sharp especially for how much time they
had to get it done and there were thumbs
some things I didn't expect like the
fact that that vibrant top panel ties in
so well to the rack yeah the fact that
it actually works with the rest of the
build is is kind of interesting
especially because he even described the
side panels as being muted yeah they
were they were it was a muted style and
then the top was very in-your-face which
is interesting and other than a couple
stencils for words here and there one of
which got waned yeah during the build
process but it ended up kind of working
yes he basically free-handed the whole
thing which is actually very impressive
something interesting talking about
free-handing they had to move the
reservoir because invidia kind of
changed the game on them with how many
graphics cards they're gonna have that
to move the reservoir into where I
believe the harddrive cages would
originally go
yeah and that ended up screwing a whole
bunch of stuff up like they had to
custom cut the power supply cover that
comes in that empty case and I think
that is what ultimately cost them the
competition because theirs was the one
that should have been done like they
could have installed Windows on it by
the end of the competition but making
those last-minute alterations ended up
causing them to not even be able to post
their system at the very end of the
competition which to my understanding
was actually the tiebreaker I think
that's actually where their extensive
planning ended up hurting them because
they planned so much that they didn't
plan for anything not going according to
plan so when something miss mixed up
their plan they didn't have any time
allotment left for it and it kind of
threw them over honestly I think losing
points for not posting might not have
been entirely fair because looking at
the other systems particularly the
winner and how functional those actually
are in spite of whether they date or
didn't post they all had post code
errors so
you can say whatever you want about that
which leads us to the project that
turned out to be the eventual winner the
team BS mods ancient IBM server machine
that Bob Stuart and rod Rosenberg chose
to tackle I think they had by far the
most ambitious project in terms of
leaving no time to spare taking
something that they could have worked
frantically at for 48 hours and trying
to do it in 24 well we would see we
would see the other teams go for smoke
breaks or like stop lunch breathe just
generally like necessity kind of things
and these guys would completely ignore
it anytime that we were wondering where
they were at for interviews just okay go
to the courtyard they'll be there
working on their case they'll be sanding
something yeah yeah for the first 20
hours they will be sanding something
yeah they had to completely build whole
day to completely fabricate and tire new
parts of their case including a whole
new back they had to add in they didn't
fabricate this but they had to add an
entirely new motherboard tray yeah it to
cover up a whole bunch of venting on the
inside of the case with I thought they
weren't gonna make it
me neither I flat out thought they were
not going to have a finished system they
at the end of the project wouldn't have
though right that brings in the 30
minute extension we were chosen to cap
off the stream because mod 24 was
freaking awesome
so they decided to let us kind of finish
it off and that gave all the teams in
extra 30 minutes which was fine because
they didn't actually have 24 hours
anyways so we allow them to have a
little bit more and get close to the 24
hour cap but with all that 30 minutes I
do not think they would have finished
and you know what I think that even if
the judges had had a little bit more
time to look at the systems or if the
judges had been a bit more technical it
might have gone to team Mongoose because
frankly it wasn't really done the
stencil behind the door was not that
great I mean I even heard them calling
it a quote-unquote 30-footer
when they were working on the paint job
because they saw how little time they
had left yeah after the fabrication and
metalworking that was involved in
getting the case to even house the
hardware that they had
yeah their fans weren't plugged in i
believe that radiator is just glued to
the back panel well they cut holes for
the radiator there's a triple radiator
whole series cut but the the tubing
doesn't reach and they had not planned
to do custom water cooling because they
knew coming into the competition
wouldn't have time but they would have
no time for that maybe spending all
their time building the case yeah so
while I don't necessarily know if the
eventual winning spot was entirely
deserved especially because they mostly
went with an NVIDIA theme not a gaming
no your favorite moment in gaming it was
very specifically your favorite moment
in gaming which I guess none of them
does kind of tie into to fill and I
don't know the others really did it
anybody yes actually that's a good point
because Phil attaches to them through
PDX land that's right and you could
definitely say that their favorite
moment in gaming was attached to PDX
land but their system also just
plain-old wasn't finished i mean the
front fans were just not plugged in yeah
even though they did manage to post
which ended up being what pushed them
over the edge although we did find that
the two systems that quote-unquote
posted were hitting post code errors and
the same post good air that actually
team Mongoose was posting on but for
some reason wasn't getting a display
output yes
so overall though with all of that said
I was cheering for Team BS mods I told
them that I told you that I thought
their project their concept was the
coolest I think they actually probably
had the most amount of people cheering
for them including myself as well
because it was so ambitious I loved what
they were doing crazy and the fact that
they pulled it off to the extent that
they did is amazing I just wouldn't want
to be them cleaning that system up the
eventual prize winner because I mean
those panels don't even go back on no
it's gonna take them an incredibly long
amount of time to finish this build
outside of the event and much more time
than any of the other two bills
especially team mongooses but it surely
was a cool concept definitely and
whoever wins it is gonna be super stoked
alright so guys that was our recap of
