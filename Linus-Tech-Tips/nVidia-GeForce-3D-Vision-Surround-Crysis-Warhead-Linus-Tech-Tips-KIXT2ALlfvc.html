always seems to be but can it play
crisis so I've actually got crisis
running on the Nvidia surround gaming
setup here and the answer is definitely
yes I'm going to try and find some bad
guys to kill or something here without
accidentally running off the cliff like
I did last time I did one ah okay so the
3d vision surround rather I'm not
running 3d vision right now we'll try 3d
vision in a minute but the surrounding
experience definitely adds to a game
like Crysis where being able to see all
around you I mean yeah you got your
radar but it's pretty helpful being able
to see oh you know hey look there's a
guy over on my left there out of your
peripheral vision whereas normally you'd
have to rely on looking directly at the
guy in order to find himself that's
pretty cool I think there's someone in
one of these well this might be an
objective oh cool I actually managed to
a good objective good work Linus okay so
here I'm going to try and turn on the 3d
vision glasses and we'll have a look at
what performance is like in terms of
framerate la better clear glitters in
this truck out first Wow my shooting is
terrible this is just unreal can I throw
a grenade inside the truck no that'll do
the trick
okay so here let's put on the 3d vision
and press this button see how it does so
frame rates a little choppy I still have
the details up pretty high so it's
possible that turning them down a little
bit would would give us a bit of an
improvement on that front but the 3d
experience with Crysis is pretty cool
it's not perfect you can actually see
over on the right side of the screen and
I'm just going to pick up the camera and
go zoom in on that for you so you can
see how Nvidia rates this particular
game this is Crysis warhead so they're
saying it's good there's a couple of
problems there's a couple in game
settings which I have already adjusted
that they recommend in order to to make
the gameplay experience a little bit
smoother overall with 3d but the focus
of this video is not only on the 3d
aspect
but also on the surround gaming aspect
so performance is acceptable even in 3d
mode which is pretty cool thank you for
checking out my video blog and that
there's a guy behind me let's see if we
can figure out where he is
oh I don't know that's oh he's in front
of me see it won't help you like be not
a noob at gaming if you're not very good
but it'll definitely make your
experience more immersive if you are not
actually trying to be good you're just
trying to like enjoy the game die die
die I need my pistol mm mm round I'm
playing on easy for those of you who are
like how is he not dead yet well that's
why for the sake of wow look at this how
many times I shoot that guy that's
ridiculous
mind you how many times did they shoot
me with that truck yeah there we go all
right thank you for checking out my
video and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
