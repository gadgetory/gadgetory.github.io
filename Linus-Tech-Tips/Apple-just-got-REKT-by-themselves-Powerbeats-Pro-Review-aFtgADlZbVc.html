been slapped on so many overpriced
headphones that were just too heavy on
the base but we were genuinely surprised
when the power beats pro turned out to
be good and not just a little good like
these might be the most recommendable
product from beats since they were
acquired by Apple in 2014 now they are
still on the expensive side at two
hundred and forty nine US dollars but
given how well these perform that might
not be unreasonable now I'm not ready to
say these are the best wireless earbuds
on the market but I'm also not going to
say that they aren't especially if
you're a particular kind of person
honey is a free web browser extension
that will find you the best promo codes
on most shopping websites like Amazon
eBay and more get it today at join
honeycomb slash LTTE so let's talk
design right off the bat you'll notice
that the case for these earbuds is huge
like I mean if other wireless earbuds
cases are meant to be small enough to
fit in your pocket this thing is meant
to be used as a as a self-defense weapon
to make your speedy escape like I mean
we get it the case has to be big enough
to accommodate the powerbeats ear hooks
but the end result is still something
that will fit more comfortably in a gym
bag than in a pocket that is to say
unless you're keeping the cargo pants
dream alive the case has a Lightning
port for charging in the back no USB C
or wireless charging here despite its
heft and a single battery indicator LED
on the front then inside there's a
pairing button and the power beats
themselves nestled in the cradle like a
pair of adorable little babies waiting
to get their trust funds so they can
afford power beats pros now if you're
familiar with the original power beats
you'll notice that these look much more
streamlined and Apple II but unlike a
lot of Apple products the power beats
Pro do not sacrifice function for form
the beats logo itself even is actually a
clickable multifunction button there's a
sensor accelerometer combo to determine
when you're wearing them and there's
even a volume rocker on both earbuds
which personally I think is pretty
freakin awesome as for the fit the ear
hooks are adjustable and they work
completely as advertised Riley who wrote
this episode could not get them off no
matter how hard he tried and believe me
she tried I'm trying to oh my head hurts
and the power beats include four sizes
of interchangeable rubber ear tips
that's one more than the Samsung Galaxy
buds and four more than the air pods and
they also have an IP X for sweat and
splash resistance rating which should
come in handy for the sweaty boys out
there
like Riley apparently and get sweaty you
will because the powerbeats pros have
enough battery to feel an impressive 9
hours of music listening time that's
nearly double the air pods battery life
with an extra 15 hours in the charging
case if you need a quick top-up five
minutes of charging will get to one and
a half hours of listening time while 15
minutes will get to four and a half
hours and if you happen to put down the
power beats pros outside of the charging
case they will actually very slowly
drain over the course of about 30 hours
and that amazing battery efficiency is
made possible partially thanks to the
same Apple h1 chip found in the new air
pods also partially due to the fact that
they're just bigger
I guess size does matter but what are
they like to use
well the pairing process is the same as
the air pods so you crack them open
within a few inches of nioh s device and
on screen prompts to connect will
automatically appear along with the
battery percentage for both the case and
the earbuds themselves also like the air
pods the process pairs the power beats
to every device assigned to your Apple
account pretty sweet as for non Apple
devices well the process is the same as
it would be for connecting any other
Bluetooth accessory but sadly and this
is again like the air pods there doesn't
appear to be any way to check battery
life on android without downloading a
third-party app even though the
percentage of literally every other
modern pair of bluetooth earphones
displays directly in the Bluetooth
settings I guess that's just apples
little way of saying should've bought an
iPhone after pairing putting the power
beats pros in your ears is a touch more
complicated than other wireless earbuds
because of the ear hooks but I think you
guys are clever enough that you
shouldn't have too much trouble after
the first couple of times and these
hooks also save you from having to push
the ear tips super deep into your ear
canals to prevent them from falling out
something that you can feel the need to
do with non hooked wireless earbuds if
you don't have an absolutely perfect fit
once they're in the multifunction button
can pause and play music with a single
skip forward and backwards with double
and triple clicks respectively and
summon your voice assistant of choice
with a long press bt-dubs like the new
air pods the power beats pros also have
a theory support so far so good then but
what about audio quality actually
they're really good true two beats
tradition the power beats pros pack a
lot of bass and arguably too much bass
and it does end up taking some character
out of the sound with the mids and highs
sounding a bit tinny especially when
compared directly to the sennheiser
momentum true Wireless but for speaking
honestly that really says more about the
quality of the Momentum's than it does
about these not to mention that the
Momentum's are $50 more we'll have a
harder time staying in your ears during
strenuous exercise and suffer from a
weird battery drain issue at idle now
let's move on to sound isolation the
power beats pros are better than the air
pods in this regard but not as good as
other wireless earbuds that we've tested
and this seems to be at least partially
due to the very air pods like bulbous
head that they have that sits in the
Concha of your ear so it's a bit of a
double-edged sword because on the one
hand this should make them more
comfortable for people who don't like
that deep ear penetration but it means
that a lot of outside noises do manage
to get in particularly in noisy
situations like riding the bus so they
still sound pretty darn good but don't
be surprised if you have to turn the
volume up a little bit to drown out the
grunts of the loudest cave people in the
gym which I guess segues us perfectly
into some other trade-offs as we said
the on device controls are awesome and
like the air pods the music will pause
when you take one ear bud out but the
power beats pros lack an ambient sound
mode like the one on the Galaxy buds and
Sennheiser Momentum's now you could
argue that they don't need it thanks to
their poor sound isolation
sure but I'm not sure that I entirely
agree with that also there's no
dedicated app with options like EQ
customization or a find my earbuds
feature and they don't show up in the
Find My iPhone app like the air pods do
in fact the only customization options
available are in the Bluetooth settings
on iOS where you can toggle automatic
ear detection and whether the onboard
mic defaults to the left or right earbud
or switches automatically honestly this
lack of customization really makes me
wish that the Sennheiser momentum true
Wireless a great sounding
platform-agnostic option didn't have
their fatal battery drain flaw though
with that said they're actually sending
us a new pair to see if that improves so
let me know in the comments if you want
to see a full review of those in the
meantime the power beats pros even at
249 are an excellent option particularly
for use while exercising
they are truly wireless so no tether
they won't fall out of your ears there's
sweat resistant the sound quality is
solid and the on device controls and
great battery life for truly wireless
earbuds are sweet bonuses so if you're
on that daily gym grind you'll be happy
with the power beats pros but that said
if you're more of a daily walking to the
bus end eating in the food court grind
kind of person you'll probably be
happier with a different pair of
wireless earbuds and a bit more money in
