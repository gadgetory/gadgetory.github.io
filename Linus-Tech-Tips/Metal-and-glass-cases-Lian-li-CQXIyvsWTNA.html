to copy text 2016 this year to get the
lap dog should be in the description
down below it allows you to use a
full-size mouse and mechanical keyboard
on your couch to play video games super
cool also thank you to MSI we're here at
the Leon Lee booth checking out the PC
cue 37 it pulls a lot of inspiration
obviously from its older brother the PC
o 9 it has that kind of two-faced look
on the front with part of it being glass
and part of it being solid brushed
aluminum and then the left hand side has
glass as well all the glass on this
computer or this case by the way is all
tempered glass which is beautiful it is
a compact ITX rig it's not the smallest
one ever but it is fairly compact so in
terms of CPU cooler you're probably
going to get about 80 millimetres if
you're going with an air cooler graphics
card fairly standard length and high
graphics cards will work much more in
the height or length Department maybe no
but I don't see a ton of those coming
out lately so it's probably fine if you
want a water cool however it is equipped
and ready to go for that in the bottom
right hand corner you have a pump mount
which is really nice then in the top
they have this accessory which I don't
think actually comes with this case
but will be available separately there's
no name for it so far but what it does
is it pulls all of your water cooling
kit together obviously other than the
blocks and the tubing it allows you to
have your pump your reservoir and your
radiator all nicely tucked in as if it
looked like an all-in-one but it's all
custom components which is pretty sweet
and then moving into the back you have
their SFX L power supply mounting area
two three and a half inch bays and a two
and a half inch Bay for a storage
expansion in terms of i/o on the front
we have a power button a USB 3.1 type-c
connector to USB 3.0 connectors a
headphone and microphone jack then we
come to the PC 10 which is extremely
similar to the PC o 9 but not in every
detail it is much smaller it's still an
ATX motherboard it still has the nice
tempered glass on the left-hand side and
the blocked off to face aluminum thing
on the right hand side and it still
zones everything off for power and
storage on the right and processing and
graphics and all that kind of stuff on
the left but it has a smaller glass off
area so you don't have quite as much
room in there and it has a much much
smaller storage and power area limiting
you down to an S
Excel power supply that might sound
terrible at first but hear me out for a
second I actually think it's pretty cool
we've done testing on Pascal very
recently and found that even on load
with a new full system you're only
pulling in the one or in the two to
three hundred range in terms of wattage
with ten 80s or ten 70s not that much
power and people like silverstone and
very specifically right here Lian Li are
showing off sfx l power supplies that
are up to like 750 watts so more than
you need so I think that's actually cool
they're cutting down the fat of the
things that you don't need and giving
you an extremely beautiful system for
what you do need in the top you have a
240 millimeter radiator in the back you
of seven expansion slots in the front
you have a power button USB 3.1 type-c
connector to USB 3.0 ports and a
headphone port and a microphone port so
yeah PC 10 I think a cool answer to the
people who maybe didn't want the boxy
design of the PC o8 or PC o9 and want
more of a standard mid-tower size
computer but still want the beautiful
sectioned off design and tempered glass
good answer to those people thanks it
into a Corsair for bringing us to copy
decks 2016 this year you can use a full
sized k70 mechanical keyboard and a full
sized Mouse to game on your couch which
is pretty cool also thanks to MSI with
their aigis X desktop and their GT X
1080 gaming x 8g graphics card we'll be
checking those out later on in the show
if you want to see that and all the rest
