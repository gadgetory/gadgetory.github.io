r3 and thought that it was a fantastic
little machine but it has a bigger
batter more bloated brother that's
coming to take all your lunch money but
in a world that is trending towards
thinner and lighter can bigger be better
let's find out
the Vitesse from Phoenix features a
lightweight design and in a vago 3310
optical sensor check it out and enter
for a chance to win one at the link in
the video description the first thing
you'll notice about the Alienware 15 is
wow this is an oh wow holy crap this
thing is heavy
coming in at almost 50% heavier then the
13-inch model I think it's fair to say
most people wouldn't want to carry it
around in a backpack everyday which
actually got us thinking both are very
similar and there's less than a 100
dollar difference between the two that
we have so then which one would we
rather have so what started as a
standalone review morphed into also a
comparison so the Alienware 15 straddles
the line between tasteful industrial
design and over-the-top leat gamer I
think the RGB lights on the sides of the
frame kind of push it overboard but
those can be disabled through alien
wares alien effects software and the
beauty of this thing is more than
skin-deep on a desk or in your bag the
laptop has a solid premium feel that
comes from its magnesium and reinforced
steel chassis the quality feeling
plastics of the outer shell especially
around the keyboard and trackpad and the
overbuilt screen hinge it really doesn't
seem like Dell cut any corners in the
construction of these machines spec wise
the Alienware 15 is available in
everything from low-end configs that
cost more than the dell inspiron gaming
for no tangible performance improvement
all the way up to our beast that sports
a gtx 1070 for graphics a quad core Core
i7 and 16 gigs of DDR 4 RAM yielding
performance that was consistently
breaking through the
60 FPS barrier and often cracking three
digits in triple-a titles and all of
this is with no worries about thermal
issues the CPU settled in at a somewhat
toasty 87 degrees in our synthetic tests
and the GPU landed at a breezy 74
degrees Celsius
neither of them were in danger of
overheating or throttling at any time
and this is unusual for a laptop we have
no complaints about acoustics either the
cooling fans are nearly silent while the
speaker's pack a really nice punch Dell
has gotten serious about audio on their
devices lately but does the screen live
up to the rest of the specs I mean sure
the horizontal viewing angles and
brightness are good the windows hello
enabled webcam is a nice touch but
compared to the OLED display on the
Alienware 13 colors look flat there's a
lack of depth to the blacks and adding
insult to injury
it isn't even available with touch
support meaning that you might be fooled
into thinking that it's outright
terrible by comparison until you move
the cursor running at a hundred and
twenty Hertz with g-sync
this thing is buttery smooth and once
you try high refresh rate gaming you'll
be hooked going back to the 60 Hertz on
the 13 feels like putting on skate shoes
for a basketball game but if the higher
refresh rate is worth it depends heavily
on your use case for csgo or overwatch
sure but if you're a filthy casual like
me playing sightseeing games like rise
of the Tomb Raider or Witcher 3 the OLED
panel along with its crispy higher
resolution compared to all but the top
tier 15 inch model not to mention it's
better out of the box calibration and 95
percent coverage of the Adobe RGB color
space
contributes more to the experience both
gaming and otherwise the
keyboard and trackpad on the Alienware
15 other than some macro keys are
identical to the 13 it's kind of weird
when you think about it considering how
much more space we have I mean come on
Dell this move feels a little bit like
you had bad leftovers and you needed
some laptops to put them on how about a
number pad maybe here and a much larger
trackpad let's say I don't know up here
I mean to be clear I'm not saying that
this reuse is a terrible thing the RGB
trackpad looks dank AF and behaved well
in our testing outside of a couple
glitches with two finger scrolling and
as for the keyboard the backlit keys
still have a nice long action to them
that avoids being mushy gaming was a
pleasure and getting up to full speed
and accuracy while typing was no problem
as long as that accuracy is near-perfect
backspace and actually the indent on the
S key instead of the W where everybody
else puts it are both small skid marks
on what is otherwise a really solid
keyboard now let's say you were to save
some costs up front how easy is it to
upgrade this thing down the road well
after removing the seven screws from the
bottom panel I was pleasantly surprised
although one MDOT - and the hard drive
bay are occupied there are actually two
more MDOT two slots making it super
simple to upgrade your speedy storage
ram is easily accessed and the battery
which held up about like you'd expect
for something so powerful so not amazing
is a quick swap making the Alienware 15
about as simple to upgrade as a laptop
can be so bottom line then both are
fantastic notebooks and if you have the
money either of them will probably make
you happy but you came here for a winner
and for once we're actually going to
give you one if you plan on gaming four
hours everyday the Alienware 15 is a
pretty easy choice with more power and
the 120 Hertz display option this thing
is wicked - game on but for anything
other than gaming the better Portability
and the
utterly unique and amazing screen of the
Alienware 13 helped it take home the
