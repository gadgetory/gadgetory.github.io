we're going to be having a look at a
very very small motherboard this is Ana
sous a t3 and 7a - I and what it is is
well why don't we just start by reading
off the front of the box it is Windows 7
ready it features the Intel Atom
processor and it has the Nvidia ion
chipset so that means that it has full
HD 1080p support which is accelerated by
the ion chipset because the atom is not
powerful enough for that it also
features bluetooth something about
perfectly suit your digital lifestyle
and let's see this feature zod has the
ion 330 so this is the dual-core atom
sorry ion 330 it is the dual-core atom
which is the one that it seems most
people are more interested in so the
first thing we find inside is a
motherboard user guides with the ion
support DVD read whatever DVD inside I
don't use that download the latest
drivers and utilities offices comm here
is the i/o shield and there's a funny
label here so that's the Bluetooth logo
right there so we'll see exactly how
they've gone an implemented bluetooth on
this particular motherboard it includes
two SATA cables and that is pretty much
it now this is one tiny board I love ITX
boards I think they're just hilarious
you know they're so small yeah they
featured you know really most of the
same functionality of a larger PC ok so
here is what we've got why don't we
actually start with just the basic
feature set so we've got support for
ddr2 RAM ok and you can support I
believe it's up to make sure before I
say anything stupid that I believe it
should support up to four gigs of RAM ok
don't quote me on that one I think it's
up to four gigs of RAM ok and then we've
got a couple of fan headers spread out
around the board we've got one two three
including the one that the little tiny
CPU fan is attached to so you can see
this probably doesn't give off a whole
lot of heat our power connectors are in
their ideal locations with the four pin
up at the top left you definitely don't
need an eight pin for this guy and then
with a 24 pin overall over here on the
right-hand edge in terms of SATA
connectors now this is something I'm a
little bit disappointed in it's only
three SATA connectors so they're using
one of the SATA one of the SATA
connections from the chipset for eSATA
but I'd really like to see more ITX
boards with between four and six
connectors because otherwise they'd be
great for use as unlike a home server or
as the storage server because they don't
use up a whole lot of power and they're
plenty fast enough for just storing data
on them you've got one PCI slot so that
allows you to add whatever it is you
need one off and you have one USB header
here so that would be for your front USB
on your case or for a card reader or for
whatever else ok one one little little
niggle I've got here is I hate little
tiny fans I would have rather they put a
bigger heatsink on it or put like a
wider heatsink on it so that they could
put a larger fan because these little
fans tend to be the first thing that
dies on anything that they're attached
to so let's have a look at the back of
the board so you got kind of a black
brown sort of PCB you can see almost all
of the traces lead back to that chipset
right there which is the atom and the
plate what hold on a minute
just a moment huh no I think the atoms
actually here I believe that's actually
the Northbridge
although I'm just guessing right now so
why don't we just move on yeah there we
go
okay so let's have a look at the i/o on
the back so we start with a standard ps2
keyboard part then we have eight USB
ports and given that something like this
would typically be deployed and
somewhere where you're you're not going
to be plugging in a whole lot to the
front you're just gonna put it somewhere
tuck it away lots of USB ports is very
optimal we've got an HDMI port then we
have two digital audio ports which makes
it very well suited for something like
like a home theater sort of box where
all you're really doing is playing back
media you got VGA just to complete the
the output options right there you have
one eSATA this is your bluetooth adapter
which I believe is probably just plugged
into okay it wouldn't surprise me if
this is just something that's plugged
into like a USB port or something or
maybe it's oh you know what I bet it's
running off what would have been your
other USB header okay
so then we've got Gigabit Ethernet and
7.1 audio thank you for checking out my
quick unboxing of the eight
three and seven a - I</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
