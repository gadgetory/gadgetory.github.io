upgraded version of the eco which is
economical and the Vantage is not as
economical so what do you get for your
less economical well first of all you
get to fans okay so you have to fans and
mounted in push-pull on the radiator
second of all you get an LCD interface
on the cpu cooler itself which gives you
error alerts as well as being
customizable with different colors so
that's pretty neat you get a universal
retention system which you also get with
the eco and you get fully upgradeable
and we'll get into more of that but you
get fully upgradeable compliance with
cool it's maestro software control
platform wireless software control
platform so that's pretty cool let's
start getting this opened up and we will
have a look at the event it advanced
liquid cooling solution for CPUs alright
here we go so cool its packaging has
evolved a lot over the years it's gotten
a lot better here's the instruction
manual it is available in a number of
different languages shows you how to
attach your back plate how to install
the Vantage in your case because it does
use a 120-millimeter fan it's look at
this this is a color manual I the
numerical is phenomenal actually because
it does use a 120-millimeter fan it is
compatible with most cases that feature
a 120-millimeter cooling fan at the back
this is your unique hardware ID number
that's kind of neat ok you have
different performance modes extreme
performance and quiet which will
actually ramp up the fan speed
differently based on the temperature and
which mode you select so that's kind of
cool else do we have in here we've got
an installed unit we've bought it's
completely configurable via the built-in
LCD screen so here's all the different
stuff that you can change and there we
go I guess the folder is really like
this I hope that maestro is still the
same the same wireless control thing
that they showed at
yes you can actually see the CES sticker
on the box so they want to design an
engineering showcase honor at CES 2010
here's all our different back plates I'm
actually not going to go too far into
that because back plates are not very
interesting and then here we have hold
downs so you go ahead and loosen that
and you can pull these apart there you
go so that's the AMD hold down all right
there if you Vantage itself curled up in
the fetal position hiding from my
unboxing oh this is interesting it's not
actually dual fan that's a shroud so
cool it has gone ahead and done a
shrouded cooler now what impact that has
on performance I'm not sure but
something that I can promise you is I
will be testing it against the corsair
h70 in the coming in the coming week or
so and then I will let you guys know
exactly what kind of a difference this
shroud makes and as well as letting you
know if it's possible to install an
additional fan because what I do see
here is an additional fen amount unless
this is a okay hold on I don't get it
this doesn't happen for me well it
happens to me once in a while during my
unboxings but now I like to think not
too often well we'll figure out exactly
what all of this means in a month but
let's take a look at the vantage itself
so here you can see this is kind of like
a fan frame that's why I mistook it for
a push-pull radiator but yeah it's just
a little mounting brackets you go ahead
and screw that into your case no problem
it uses quite a thin low a profile
radiator and then you can see it is
completely sealed so this is the fill
port right here and then there is an
inlet and an outlet port into the
radiator which runs right over to your
cpu block now this is one thing that's
really cool that cool it's done with
their coolers as you can see they do use
rotating post Barb's so what that means
is if you're installing the vented
radiator in your case like this and your
CPU socket is most comfortable like that
or like that or wherever it is that you
need to mount it you have that
flexibility and you can
mount it however you need to so here on
the cpu block or rather the cpu block
and pump because it's an integrated unit
you've got one power input m1 power
output so yeah here we go so this plugs
in here and powers the fan so it looks
like we don't have built-in support for
an additional fan and it is meant to be
used as like a shrouded setup ok and
then this one plugs into your CPU socket
here is the LCD screen itself which you
can see will look right side up
regardless of which way you install it
in your case although I don't know if it
has some way of knowing whether it's
right side up or not you can see this is
the universal mounting system here so
you can slide this in and out depending
on what kind of an Intel setup you are
using and then you can install the AMD
brackets if you are using an AMD setup
so here you just lift it up and then I
believe you push it over hold on see if
I can figure this out I don't help that
wire wasn't there yeah there we go and
then you just pull it in like that so
you just put it in the position it
belongs in put the appropriate back
plate on the back your motherboard and
boom it's mounted just like that here is
the bottom of the Vantage so you can see
they actually label which holes you need
to move the mounting kit over to in
order to have it fit on socket 775 1156
or 1366 you can see it does have pre
applied thermal compound on the bottom
of the copper CPU water block and I
think that's pretty much all there is to
say about it actually that's not all
there is to say I want to talk a little
bit about bullets maestro software I
don't know if they'd actually release
this yet by the way here the mounting
screws for the radiator but maestro
allows you to monitor and control your
system via software from like a
convenient software interface and you
can actually set all the different
things like fan profiles as well as even
lighting effects I believe you can
change with maestro there's a bunch of
really cool
stuff they showed up at CES but I think
one of the reasons they're not talking
about it too much yet is that it's not a
hundred percent ready yet I mean
software stuff like that often takes a
long time to develop and debug if you
want it to work right and if there's one
thing cool it has demonstrated again and
again is that they don't like to release
a product until it's actually ready so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the cool advantage and stay tuned for
some performance testing thank you for
