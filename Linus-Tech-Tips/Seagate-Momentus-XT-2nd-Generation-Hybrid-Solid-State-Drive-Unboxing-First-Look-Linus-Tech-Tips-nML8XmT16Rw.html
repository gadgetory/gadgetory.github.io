xt now this is not your father's or your
grandfather's or your slightly older
brothers momentus xt this is the new
second-generation momentus xt so this is
a 750 gig drive if you guys remember the
original momentus xt only went up to 500
gigs it also had instead of four gigs of
slc flash built-in it has eight gigs of
slc flash which is in terms of write
speeds is almost double the speed of the
original momentus xt which makes a huge
difference in write operations and in
terms of read operations it is about
seventy percent faster and really most
of what you're going to be doing with a
momentus xt from the flash side of
things is going to be reads so it will
be in short significantly faster than
the original momentus xt it's still a
7200 RPM drive in spite of the two and a
half inch slim notebook form factor so
this is all about use in notebooks what
other improvements have they made well
they have okay fast technology which i
think is actually kind of clever flash
assisted storage technology they have
upgraded the I can't really call it
software it's more of a firmware because
it's part of the the drives inner
workings but they have upgraded their
fast technology their flash assisted
storage to be more efficient including a
really cool thing called fast factor
boot which the very first time you use
the momentus xt second-generation
product to boot up your notebook it will
cash all of your boot files into the
eight gig SSD then it will leave them
there forever well not be not not
forever if you you know you have a
different OS you'll eventually overwrite
them but the point is that if you have
it booted up for a long time you use a
bunch of different programs even over
and over and over again it will not
flush those boob files out of the SSD
what that gives you is compared to the
original momentus xt significantly
better performance when booting or when
resuming from sleep or doing anything
that involves bringing your OS from a
non operational state to an operational
state in practice it performs similar
early to an SSD but not quite there in
terms of its boot performance because
it's pretty much running it entirely off
the SSD but not a hundred percent so
this wouldn't be an unboxing unless I
went through the mounting options so
we've got our hard drive screw mounts
here and here and finally here this is a
say 236 gigabit per second drive so they
have also upgraded the interface from
say two to three gigabit per second
although I would speculate that on a
drive like this it's not going to make
that much of a difference in fact most
drives on the market don't benefit from
say 23 but it's there in case you want
SATA power is also here and I want you
guys to stay tuned to my NCIX comm
channel because I'm going to be doing
more of a performance evaluation of this
drive versus aceite three SSD vs a
regular desktop 7200 RPM drive and also
going through all of the technologies
that are involved in it in more detail
