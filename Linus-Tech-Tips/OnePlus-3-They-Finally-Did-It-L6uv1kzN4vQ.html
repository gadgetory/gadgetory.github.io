been kind of like watching a kid girl up
in high school he was the kid who got
caught picking his nose and eating it
but like he had this sick home theater
setup for his xbox so we all pretended
it never happened
in college he blossomed into this wicked
athlete who ended up getting cut from
the team for blazing up behind the
portables and now he's back to show me
what he can do now that he's all grown
up this is the 1+2
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours through the link
down below so why couldn't one Plus
repeat what they did with the 1+1 their
first flagship class phone at an
impossibly low price of 299 US dollars
well because it's easier to do that when
you piggyback off of your parent company
as an experimental startup project with
no expectations of profitability you
can't actually do the marketing customer
service and both software and hardware
are D necessary to compete as a global
brand on margins that thin so some
compromises got made on the oneplus 2
including its lack of NFC and its
pricing was still higher even for the
base 16 gig model at 329 US dollars but
our users really that sensitive to a few
bucks what if we didn't have to make any
compromises and the device could still
be a couple of hundred dollars cheaper
than its flagship competitors well that
seems to be the formula this time and I
think it worked let's have a look at
this puppy the one plus three is thinner
than the Samsung Galaxy s7 at seven
point three five millimeters though it's
hard to say just how much of how great
it feels in the hand is due to this and
how much is due to the excellent weight
distribution and very similar overall
weight in spite of the significantly
larger screen 5.5 inches that's still
too big for my hands but the aluminum
alloy construction is very
confidence-inspiring
and I can say confidently that it's the
most comfortable five-and-a-half inches
that I have ever held thanks to the
rounded rear edges reasonable sized chin
bar and super slim bezels around it's
1080p display which okay so there's one
compromise oneplus has opted for a 1080
screen again but I didn't disagree with
their choice last time and I don't
disagree with
this time and there are some upgrades to
it too the three gets this wonderfully
high contrast non-reflective and
miraculously not oversaturated AMOLED
panel with white point adjustments built
right into the operating system so you
can tune it according to your
preferences direct sunlight performance
is not quite there with the galaxy s7
and 1080p is not ideal for VR so
residents of the planet mercury who are
really into Google cardboard need not
apply
but it is a great display above it next
to the eight colour notification LED is
an 8 megapixel 1080p video selfie camera
that falls comfortably into good enough
for front-facing if you need better turn
your damn phone around territory and
then below the screen is one of my
favorite things about the op3
Samsung's marriage to ripping off the
iPhones physical home button is becoming
more and more out of place and the 1
plus 3 is in my mind the golden standard
for how to handle Android buttons you
can choose to use the capacitive
Hardware buttons with a very fast
fingerprint sensor embedded in the
middle one or you can choose to disable
them outright and offer on-screen
buttons and in either configuration you
can set back and recent apps to
whichever side you prefer and oxygen OS
as clean and stock Android like as it is
includes a number of these small but
actually meaningful customizations some
like the invert color mode or the night
mode I didn't really care for but others
drawing on-screen long press and double
press gestures for launching apps and
they're easy memo taking and shelf when
you swipe to the left of the homescreen
sucked me right in
on the left of the device you'll find a
button I didn't really use much that
lets you allow all some or no
notifications through a one button
feeder mode if you will and one of one
pluses few missteps the volume rocker
which is directly opposing the lock
button making it hard to especially
adjust volume up without mashing the
lock over on the right side that sits
below the sim and only SIM no microSD
expansion that's last real flaw
I'm going to point out tray on the
bottom the good stuff continues the
built-in speaker is downward-facing but
it is surprisingly loud with only a
little bit of distortion creeping in at
the top two volume settings and this is
really smart if they did it on purpose
the grill is on the opposite side
compared to the iPhone 6s and the galaxy
s7 which means that while you do have to
do the palm cupping thing it works way
better than usual because it fires right
into the rounded part of your palm cool
between the grill and the headphone jack
which by the way I prefer on top so I
don't mash capacitive buttons trying to
take my phone out of my pocket in case
anyone from oneplus is actually watching
this is a USB type-c port with support
for another solid feature up to 4 amp
charging at 5 volts that allows the 3000
milliamp hour battery to reach 60% in
about half an hour and this they claim
is without generating as much heat in
the phone itself as other quick charging
solutions for less thermal throttling
while gaming on wall power for example
here's a thermal camera shot versus the
HTC 10 which uses Qualcomm quick charge
3.0 for comparison but without the right
horses you wouldn't be gaming much
anyway I haven't been avoiding that on
purpose the three packs of Snapdragon
820 6 gigs of lpddr4 ram 64 gigs in the
base configuration of u FS 2.0 storage
which makes the lack of microSD quite a
bit more forgivable IMO dual sims NFC
Gorilla Glass 4 great call quality and a
16 megapixel front camera so on par with
pretty much anything else out there in
theory all at its 399 price point
however we know cameras are a critical
feature and we know that megapixels do
not a camera make but there's more good
news the camera on the oneplus 3 kicks
ass it launches lightning fast it
focuses very quickly it shoots 4k video
and Raw photos it features ample manual
controls in its stock app
it's image quality is competitive enough
with flagship phones like the galaxy s7
and the iPhone 6s that when Brandon took
his test shots around to folks here at
the office even if they could pick out a
winner and it wasn't the one plus three
it took a while and they had to look at
it pretty closely and remember that
these are much more expensive devices
compared to my pre-production axon 7 a
more comfortably priced device there is
no contest
whatsoever I am a little salty that it
can't snap a photo or start shooting
video from the same initial screen
instead requiring a swipe but hopefully
one plus are you listening that can be
fixed in software and then I wouldn't
feel like I was missing out on really
any part of the s7 s camera experience
by switching I don't actually know
what's more remarkable here the way
oneplus has grown so much in such a
short span from a weird offshoot from a
Chinese brand to a bonafide sustainable
competitor in the high-end smartphone
market did I mention by the way the
deplorable invite system is gone or the
way that through all of it they have
proven to be the only high-tech company
in the mobile space or otherwise who
actually knows how to count
so I'll just congratulate them on both
and say good work on the oneplus 3 keep
it up you know who else did a good job D
brand cuz D brand made a skin for the
oneplus 3 already and you can head over
to D brand comm we've got a link in the
video description and check out the wide
variety of skins they have not just for
the oneplus 3 but also for a huge
variety of other devices including
phones game consoles game controllers
and even laptop computers the best part
about deep brand site has got to be
their configurator which lets you take
all the different skins wood grain
carbon fiber solid color and preview
what they look like as a precision
fitted skin on your device including
combining different colors with other
colors like I did in my iPhone se review
to great effect that is one eye catching
phone so check it out at the link in the
video description that's deep
and skins makers of the high quality
vinyl skins that you'll see on pretty
much every phone that we review over
