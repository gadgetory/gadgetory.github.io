this on my test bench and assume that
this is going to be a video about 3-way
SLI scaling on the GTX 670 that is not
actually the topic of this video that
will be a separate video where I'm gonna
do GTX 670 3-way vs. radeon HD 6970
3-way because the performance of these
cards is pretty close so I am very
interested to see who scales better at
large at a high resolution like 2560 by
1600 but know this video is about
temperatures power consumption and noise
yes those three things of the GTX 670
compared to its immediate competition
that is the GTX 680 this 7970 the 7950
the 7870 and the card that it replaces
the GTX 570 so one of the points that I
just wanted to make to open this one up
that's why I have three cards on the
bench right now is that even with these
three cards we are drawing less than 100
watts from the wall at idle this is with
an overclocked 4.4 gigahertz 39 30 36 30
K 39 30 sorry guys it's like 4:00 in the
morning and I'm really tired so that's a
3930k at 4.4 gigahertz with all the
power saving features turned off 16 gigs
of ram SSD boot drive big ol XL ATX
motherboard 3 GTX 670 s and this is
running off of a 1250 watt 80 plus gold
power supply so what that means is
because this is a 1250 watt power supply
is extremely inefficient at only 10
percent load so in terms of actual power
consumption this system is probably in
the neighborhood of about 80 watts at
idle which means these cards are pulling
next to nothing at idle this GTX 670 is
very power efficient I'm going to show
you some graphs and charts as well as
some audio clips comparing it's cooler
and it's cooling characteristics as well
as its power draw to its competition now
I showed you guys in the introduction
the system is drawing less than a
hundred watts at the wall so what that
means is that when we have a single card
drawing 70 watts from the wall those two
additional cards running in 3-way SLI
when they're idling are basically almost
completely shut down which is very very
cool it makes for a much more efficient
computing experience because you're not
always going to be loading up all three
cards with the latest 3d games sometimes
you have to check your email and it's
great if you're not sucking a ton of
power back in paying an immense
electricity bill on account of your your
massive gaming rig and this is this is
totally labeled incorrectly so I
apologize for that this is power in
watts and then less is better in case
you guys didn't know that okay so what
else we got here so you can see that the
GTX 670 is very competitive in terms of
its performance per watt because it does
outperform the HD 7950 and it performs a
little bit less than the 7970 so it
falls right into where it's supposed to
be the idle power is very very very
exciting as well and you can see it
draws just a little bit less power than
its older brother the GTX 680 which
stands to reason when you compare it to
the previous generation product it
smokes it not only in terms of
performance but also in terms of both
gaming load power as well as idle power
so how did I measure gaming load power
using this guy right here and then I
would stand next to a particular car in
battlefield 3 in the in the underground
parkade where I was getting very
consistent power readings from all the
cards that were pretty near the peak
that I was seeing during gaming just
glancing at my power meter the whole
time so that's how I'm measuring the
maximum power no it's not 100%
scientific but it does give you a pretty
good idea of what you're going to be
able to expect from any of these given
cards and the way I was measuring idle
power was just with my spreadsheet here
open and nothing else happening so all
of these newfangled cards are so
efficient at idle that we only really
start to see some separation once they
really get loaded up now let's talk
temperatures now these are going to be a
little bit tough to compare because the
7950 data especially
is not going to be very similar to the
other data because this is not using a
reference cooler this is using a
sapphire dual fan cooler that does a as
you can clearly see significantly better
job than the than the reference cooler
that's on the 7970 right there even
accounting for the fact that the 7950
does not run as hot so bear that in mind
these numbers are not directly
comparable between the 670 and the 79 50
so the 670 runs pretty much the same
temps as its older brother I measured
these using pretty much the same method
so I'm taking the idle temperatures once
it's idled at the desktop for you know
five minutes or whatever and it's pretty
much settled into a very flat line and
low temps are taken when I'm looking at
that same car so that's after I've been
benchmarking for about 15 minutes
already with the games beforehand and
then I get on to battlefield 3 and I'm
seeing at that point as well a very very
flat line so that's when the
temperatures have completely equalized
so this gives you some idea what to
expect from a reference card however
even if at launch for GTX 670 there are
non reference cards available already
and I'm having trouble finding it right
now but I have them lying around here
somewhere there you go galaxy has a
pretty sweet non reference card at
launch that has like a glowing GeForce
GTX 670 logo thing going on and dual 92
millimeter cooling fans and it looks
just like beastly and everything so so
bear that in mind guys this is just
based on reference cards based on a non
overclocked card and I guess that's
pretty much all there is to it they run
about what you would expect compared to
similar competition like the HD 7970 a
little bit cooler at idle a little bit
hotter under load now guys you're gonna
see some clips of just you know
close-ups of the video cards like this
these are once again not scientific
these are not meant to evaluate the
exact you know decibel level noise level
of these cards they are meant to give
you an idea of the idle and load
signature of the noise so whether it's a
low growl or whether it's kind of a
high-pitched squeal that is what you
guys can evaluate with these clips it
should give you some idea
of the of the loudness of the cards but
it's not you know it's not scientific so
just bear that in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
