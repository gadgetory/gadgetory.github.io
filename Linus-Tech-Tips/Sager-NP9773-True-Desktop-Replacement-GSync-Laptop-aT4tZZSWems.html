development to anyone who wasn't paying
attention four months ago when our bros
over at pc perspective did an in-depth
analysis of the rumored hacked g-sync
driver including a physical teardown to
find out if there was secretly a g-sync
module inside making it work
spoiler alert there wasn't so then how
does mobile g-sync work and is it even
any good stay tuned because we'll be
using the Sager and p90 773 gaming
laptop to find out oh and mash the
thumbs up button below if you'd like to
see us take a closer look at how 128
gigs of quad-channel ddr4 FX performance
with an 18 core CPU
freshbooks is the online accounting
service for small business owners that
gives you the tools to make you feel
like the boss you are click on my face
to learn more about it so let's start
with a tour of the laptop we're checking
out today the word of the day is
incredible the Sager np97 73 is
incredible it's incredibly fast has an
incredible amount of i/o
is incredibly large and heavy and this
is really incredible features a desktop
processor for incredible mobile
performance that's right the np97 73
puts the desktop in desktop replacement
with a full LGA 1150 Core i7 4790k quad
core hyper threaded processor at its
heart one that impressively managed to
run for me at full 4.2 gigahertz turbo
under a multi threaded CPU only workload
even on a soft surface like a bed al
biet at a slightly uncomfortable 90
degree CPU temperature our model is
equipped with 16 gigs of dual-channel
Rama 128 gig m2 SSD and a one terabyte
hard drive but it can be configured with
up to 32 gigs of RAM up to 2 m dot 2
SSDs and up to 2 2 and a half inch hard
drives or SSDs and pretty much any
capacity it's got an Intel 72 65 2 by 2
AC wireless card and a gtx 980m 8 gig
graphics card the best GPU you can get
for a laptop the rest of the specs
aren't configurable so on the left
you've got Gigabit Ethernet 3 USB 3.0
ports an SD card reader in any SATA
ports that also doubles as a USB 2.0
port by the way on the right is a final
USB 3.0 port headphone line in
microphone and optical out audio ports
then on the back is power in HDMI 1.4 a
and a pair of DisplayPort 1.2 ports on
the bottom is a subwoofer and a couple
of air intakes to feed the rear exhaust
ports along with some easy access
hatches for drive or memory upgrades and
on top of the device is a simple logo
with a soft touch finish that I found
pleasing to the eye and to the hand
since we find it when we open up the lid
on the wrist rest as well also down here
we find a full-size keyboard include
number pad with RGB backlighting that
supports a number of lighting modes my
impressions of the keyboard are
something along lines of it's okay
nothing stood out to me is really bad or
good about it I'll touch stiff the right
shift is a little short but the arrow
key layout is good and the breathing or
color cycling effects are cool if you're
into that sort of thing there's also an
off-center touchpad with separated
buttons and a fingerprint reader in the
middle something I didn't know that I
cared about until I checked out the
Lenovo x1 carbon recently and absolutely
loved it I actually really liked the
touch pad too and I can't quite put my
finger on why ironically but it just
felt super responsive and accurate even
if it doesn't have the glass-top feel
that I like so much
moving up are the speakers that don't
suck something that deserves a mention
even though it's a lot less challenging
on devices this size and on something
like the MacBook 2015 I reviewed
recently and finally this screen this is
what this laptop is really about for me
not because it's 17 inch size or 1920 by
1080 Full HD resolution is particularly
groundbreaking or even because it's
unusual anymore to see IPS monitors and
gaming laptops but because it runs at 75
Hertz out of the box when 60 Hertz is
much more typical and because it
features g-sync at some point I'm gonna
get sick of rehashing g-sync and you're
all going to get sick of hearing about
it but it is not this day
g-sync and other variable refresh rate
technologies improve animation
smoothness and games by refreshing the
display whenever the graphics card
outputs a frame instead of that even
intervals which can cause lag or screen
tearing whenever the graphics card on
the monitor are out of sync with each
other so now we've got it on a notebook
and all we can really do is well talk
about the gaming experience first I
wanted to find out how it felt out of
the box so at 75 Hertz I loaded up a
couple of games that I enjoy
benchmarking Crysis 3 and Grand Theft
Auto 5 to see how they did
for starters IPS gaming really is the
way forward that much is very clear to
me now that I've gone that route on my
desktop as well as my daily
her notebook the slight difference in
pixel response times IMO is worth the
improved image quality and for number
two G sync is awesome on a laptop just
like it is on a desktop at least for now
and Vidya has already said that they can
enable some additional functionality
with the g-sync module in the desktop
displays which presumably on these
notebook displays that are running on
embedded DisplayPort directly to the
panel scaler without an nvidia module
won't be able to do but just like what I
said in my Ben qxl 27:30 Z video
recently I don't mind a slightly worse
handling of some edge cases outside of
the you know sort of optimal operation
window frame rates since this is the PC
so you can just tweak your settings to
get everything perfect in 95 or 99% of
cases so I'll say the same thing here a
quick hop into the game menu to balance
your frame rates in that 45 to 75 range
is gonna make for a great g-sync gaming
experience but it actually gets better
panel refresh rate overclocking is
definitely a thing on this particular
IPS monitor and I got ours up to a
hundred Hertz with no hassle whatsoever
so now we're really flying and perhaps
even getting some kind of small benefit
out of our core i7 4790k however tiny
that might be since it does actually
turbo a little higher than a notebook
CPU in not very threaded workloads like
games allowing us to get slightly higher
maximum frame rates which I guess just
leads to the conclusion of this video
how is the Sager np97 73 well if you
want great battery life go buy a MacBook
because between the desktop CPU and the
fact that mobile g-sync precludes the
use of Optimus onboard graphics sharing
to save battery and light workloads
battery life is pretty much a
non-starter here but if you want a
mobile workstation that's quiet under
light workloads reasonably quiet still
under heavy ones and is truly as
powerful as your desktop even in heavy
multi-threaded workloads it looks
darn good and you can cancel your gym
membership too since moving your
computer around it's gonna be one heck
of a workout
