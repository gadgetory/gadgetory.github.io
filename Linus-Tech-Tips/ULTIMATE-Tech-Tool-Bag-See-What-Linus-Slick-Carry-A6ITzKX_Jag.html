for more details now I've been asked a
ton of times to show what I think is
sort of a an ultimate tech bag what do I
carry around with me what does slick
carry around with him when working on
computers are just generally doing tech
things so we're going to do that episode
today and we're going to start with the
big stuff I always carry a laptop these
days with such small laptops available I
use an ultrabook just because it's
really convenient and it doesn't take up
much space in my bag which is otherwise
very very full I'm one of those hopeless
obsessives who actually carries a mouse
pad around just because I can't stand
using a mouse without one a tablet is
great to have just for looking up
something next to you or sitting and
watching videos while you're otherwise
working on something so do carry a
tablet with a nice durable case on it in
this case I use my iPad for that alright
next pocket we've got a webcam never
know when one of those is going to come
in handy we've got an SSD never know
when one of those is going to come in
handy
yep this I'll keep an OS on so that
gives me a nice fast platform in order
to boot up too and sort of do any
diagnostics if they have you know a slow
virus a written hard drive that I
otherwise basically can't use I always
carry a spare Mouse to go with my spare
mouse pad so in this case it's a
Logitech g9x it's an older Mouse but I
really really like it so business cards
no self-respecting text should go
anywhere without their business cards
because you never know when there's
going to be a PC in need copy of
antivirus these days it's less necessary
so that's more of a figurative thing
because you can download them
anti-static bag somewhere safe to put
stuff that you take out of the system
sometimes customers will go oh well I
don't really need that RAM anymore now
that you put the new stuff in there you
can have it want somewhere safe
might be able to take that home with you
that's good stuff notepad little notepad
for sticky notes SATA cables never go
anywhere without those
spare router sometimes when you're
diagnosing a network problem the problem
is the network so you can use your
router either as a wireless access point
in router or you can just use it as a
switch if you need to wire up a few
different computers spare cooling fan
can be great for diagnosing cooling
related issues so you can take this
strap it next to something that's
overheating and find out if that's
what's actually causing the problem
multimeter this is great for even just
basic stuff like diagnosing power
supplies is this is this extension cable
even working all right
USB hub especially when you're working
on modern computers if it's a laptop for
example a lot of them don't have more
than a couple of USB ports and it's
great to be able to plug in a keyboard
mouse and a USB Drive or and many of the
other things that you might need wire
strippers these I carry maybe not
necessary for everyone but power
adapters for my laptop as well zip ties
use those all the time
notepad bigger notepad this is great for
doing things like overclocking let's
face it it's not always the most
convenient and fastest thing in the
world to have two computers going and be
documenting things in Excel and I
personally find myself jotting things
down with pen and paper all the time
even these days isopropyl alcohol you
don't have to carry around a whole
bottle of it but I still find it's very
useful for removing thermal compound
which is also in here you can usually
borrow toilet paper wherever you happen
to be so I keep a three and a half
millimeter
extension cable just because I find that
comes in handy for me every very so
rarely once in a while USB cables a to
mini B so this is great for digital
cameras and stuff like that
82 micro B so this is great for
cellphones charging up your phone
whatever else and this one's attached to
something a 2 or did I say a 2 mini B
that was A to B A to B so that's for
printers and a 2 mini B so in this case
it's pre attached to my external optical
drive which i also carry around with me
again because if you're working on a
laptop that doesn't have one and you
happen to need to I actually need to use
a CD then you'll be pulling your hair
out
have that power bar is great to set up
at your temporary workstation so you can
make sure you have all this stuff
plugged in while you work I recommend
getting one that has a fairly long cord
so that you can run it from somewhere
inconvenient if you need to alternately
you can carry an extension cable as well
electricians tape never know when that
will come in handy keep Oller for
mechanical keyboards this is a slick
special I don't actually carry one of
these but he does ah Apple cable even if
you don't own any Apple products you
know many times I've been asked if
someone can borrow one of those it's
just nice to have it on hand okay
apparently we had more than I thought
for those USB cables that was a USB a to
be a little mini heatsink this is
another one that's good for diagnosing
weird just weird issues is it heat
related is it not and then carrying
around some double-sided thermal
adhesive is another good one so you can
actually stick it to stuff this is my
iFixit tool kit it contains a whole
bunch of really cool stuff so number one
is an anti-static wrist strap right
there number two is a bunch of cool like
tweezers and pry tools that I can use to
take stuff apart or get stuff out of
hard-to-reach places huge set of
precision screwdrivers including some
security bits and things that you can
use for taking apart stuff that they
don't want you to take apart so that's
that's really great and then left but
not least some more pry tools and
measuring tools and all that kind of
good stuff
not that impressed with the build
quality of the kit overall to be
perfectly honest I bought it a little
while ago and I was trying to remove a
screw for my fs700 camera and now my one
of my Phillips heads looks like this
because I am apparently super beast bent
way too easily okay
always carry a pen never know when that
will come in handy my Windows seven pen
to go with my Windows Vista backpack
awesome side cutters these are great for
cutting off cable ties that your wire
managing with or cutting wires that are
in your way for example I'll use these
to cut off the AC ninety seven header
block and my ovens going off I'll use
these to cut off the AC ninety seven
header block so that it's not ugly and
in the way and I'll just plug in the HD
audio needle nose pliers
holy crap you can use these for almost
anything I used to carry vice grips with
me but I'd stopped doing that now that I
don't water cool as much because what I
do is I would use vice grips to tighten
compression fittings with a cloth or or
some you know paper towel to keep them
from getting damaged screwdriver multi
head screwdriver the bits that I use are
slot small Phillips so that's I think
that's a number set a zero remember what
this is but it's a it's a little little
tiny one and then a big Phillips I think
that's a number two can't remember for
the life of me I'm sorry guys I'm not
really good tools but big Phillips small
Phillips and medium Phillips and then I
also carry a slot and that stand
standard size Roberts Robertson whatever
it is like I said not a tool guy that's
used for almost everything so those are
the bits that I carry this is a snap-on
ratcheting screwdriver so it's great for
working extremely quickly electric
screwdrivers you go as fast as they go
so especially when you're threading in a
screw and you need that fine touch it's
nice to be able to do this with your
fingers it has a knurled portion here so
you can do that and then wrench it tight
when you get to the end it's also great
for going quickly because you can move
as fast as your fingers can move or you
can wrench it like that so I love this
screwdriver I've had a lot of people ask
me about my screwdriver there you go
I've been using it for years now I've
had that for about eight nine years all
right
always carry headphones in fact those
are a headset those there's a
SteelSeries flux in ear pros and this is
a weird one but I actually carry two USB
sound cards because you never know when
some weird issue like premiere was
crashing the other day on diesels
workstation problem ended up being the
onboard video or the onboard sound on
the motherboard we were using this one
didn't fix it but this one did so I have
a steel series one and I have a zone are
you three from a soos which has been
very handy video adapters I'm missing my
DVI to VGA adapter that should be here
but I also always carry mini DisplayPort
to full sized DisplayPort DisplayPort to
DVI and just in case I have an active
powered this mini DisplayPort to dual
link DVI
that will only come up in very rare
scenarios but you never know molex to
SATA you never know when you're going to
have to install a harddrive in someone's
computer and they don't have any spare
SATA connectors so I carry a one two to
one so that I can plug in my SSD plug in
the new hard drive do whatever it is
that I need to do a wall work for your
USB charging just in case you're sitting
somewhere a while you need to charge up
your phone while you're waiting and then
I personally carry a bunch of fan
adapters so some splitters one to two so
you can take only one available header
and plug in two fans lots of computers
won't have extra headers and maybe they
got a cheapo oam fan that doesn't come
with an adapter and then I also carry a
fan speed controller this is more for my
personal use or it's not a controller
this is just a molex that splits out to
5 volt 7 full and 12 volt so this will
give you a good idea of the startup
voltage of a fan if you're just curious
and you want to know ah this
three-and-a-half millimeter to RCA super
handy use it all the time
three-and-a-half millimeter to whatever
that bigger one is and then the other
way around the bigger one to
three-and-a-half millimeter keep those
together keep them with you at all times
never know when you're going to need
those full set of allen keys super handy
again I carry one water cooling barb
with me because you never know when
you're going to be one short but that's
kind of a holdover from what I used to
water cool a lot more once again
external hard drive so USB drives aren't
always enough and this one right here
has a modular USB through our 3-2 SATA
adapter that comes with it so I could
plug this into some other drive and use
it like this as a USB Drive if I needed
to this is one of Seagate's go flex
things awesome
like that's a must-have for any tech
toolkit love it battery bank so USB
charger this one charges out of a little
thing that comes out of the bottom this
isn't a particularly big one but these
are so handy SD card reader and SD card
never know when you'll need one of those
USB drives galore so I usually carry a
USB Drive in my back out there this USB
Drive in my back pocket that's my main
one it's a 64 gig Patriot supersonic and
then I always carry at least one or two
backups
so in this case we've got a survivor as
well as a flash voyager these are I
think a 64 and a 16-gauge and 32 or
something like that
more screwdrivers what's great about
these screwdrivers versus the ones that
come in the iFixit toolkit is they're
fantastic for putting fans and radiators
for example because they're just over 25
millimeters long so you can get right in
there and they're you know you can
torque them enough in fact you can use
the vice grips that I used to carry
around with me or even the needlenose
pliers which now I can't find anymore to
grab on to the grips here and tighten
things even in really hard-to-reach
places so I carry a full set of small
slots as well as a full set of small
Phillips and this is a special one this
actually came with a leanly case so this
is a hex on the top here this is the
size of motherboard standoffs highly
recommend carrying around one of these
it allows you to tighten them in so that
when you go to remove the motherboard it
doesn't undo the stand off from the
backplate rather than undoing the screw
from the stand off which can be a real
pain yet another screwdriver you can
never have enough screwdrivers a USB
wireless adapter always carry a USB
wireless adapter just in case you're
trying to diagnose a networking issue
and they're wireless dies for example my
wife calling but it's okay we're almost
done here extra sanyo eneloop
always always always extra double-a
batteries in handy are in yeah comes in
handy all the time and what's great
about Anna loops is you can leave them
in your bag and they don't just charge
that quickly microSD to SD adapter so
that you can use the card reader where's
our card reader is our card reader in
order to read them and then we've got
hot car power to USB never know when
that will come in handy and finally
we've got a couple of Ethernet cables so
guys what I'd like you to do if you made
it all the way through this video is
leave your own suggestions for things
that you feel like we missed in the
comments under the video or in the forum
thread linked in the description I'm
going to show you a few more things that
didn't make it into my bag but are
things that could come in handy carrying
around one of these little one of these
little battery powered speakers can be
useful if you don't have
phone that you know has great speakers
built into it like mine does kimchi bowl
noodle never know when you're going to
be working for a long time this was
slick suggestion he actually carries an
extra kimchi bowl noodle and a fork in
his bag at all times so there you go
USB number pad okay this is a useful one
and I personally
oops I personally am more of a mouse and
mouse pad diva but slick carries the
number pad as well as a ten keyless
keyboard around with him in his bag when
he feels like it'll come in handy this
is his limited edition one that I think
he just wanted to show off because it's
limited edition but this is not the
actual one who carries a smart guy but
he does actually carry one I've seen him
do it
also in here we've got the cable for
that as well as a measuring tape and
this this one's me I actually carry a
calculator in my bag at all times I
don't like the touchscreen interface and
I like being able to see I carry this
instead of the number pad so if I need
to add something up or whatever else I
use this so thank you guys for checking
