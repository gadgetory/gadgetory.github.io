these forms and put it in the old fish
bowl in order to qualify here's the
Samsung booth never one to be upstaged
when it comes to awesome demo so we're
going to take a closer look at a couple
of things they have inside here at the
samsung blue there's tons of cool stuff
including their new series nine central
station monitor so this reduces the
cable clutter at your desk as well as
delivering their latest pls panel
technology in a super high resolution
last sleek-looking front panel format
this looks like a beautiful monitor as
you guys know I'm a huge fan of their
existing pls monitors so it can only get
better with time we've also got a couple
of series 7 tablets this one's running
Windows 7 but they're actually going to
have one set up running Windows 8
preview as well so you can take full
advantage of the touchscreen
capabilities all miss tablet we've got a
wide variety of other stuff including
their latest TV technique
even some printer about six notebook so
you can try out whatever you want just
check it out so see you there gigabyte
boots pretty blinged up I saw antec sort
of swing by here earlier putting their
little LEDs on the table in order to
dress things up a little bit as well as
tidying up the cable management you know
not celebrating our gigabyte guy here at
the toe on is tidy cabling but you can
see it looks pretty slick with
everything all tied up nicely is a nice
cable extensions as well as the antec
nine 20 cooler h2o with the sweet LED
lighting effect and no I Kisho be
complete without AMD they're showing off
a nice running our gaming machines here
and they also have a bunch of others
really cool so you can shape sir where
we've come from in terms of video card
technology and how much more advances
these days with the 7900 series and they
also have one thing that I think is
pretty cool is a bit of a Museum of AMD
CPUs going all the way back to some
pretty ancient stuff from back when AMD
used to even share a socket with Intel
now they've they definitely come a long
way from that as well they've also got
wafer here showing how the CPUs actually
come out of the manufacturing facility
before they're packaged up like this
Corsair's got there a wide portfolio of
products on demo including their
peripherals mice keyboards headsets as
well as cooling products including my
personal favourite pre-done liquid
cooling unit the h100 was about one of
their newer cases
so you can actually touch it feel it see
how you like it and don't see any ram
but I think we're all pretty familiar
with corsair ran at this point benq
projectors and monitors don't forget
they do both they've got the GP to hear
their little pocket projector this is
one of the show deals where you can get
it with the battery pack that runs for
about four hours which is pretty cool it
also about a three division light boost
ready monitor powered by hem an NCIX pc
one that we actually did a video about a
little while ago and sony really brought
everything they brought they pulled out
all the stops with their PS vita boot so
you can come here check out the vita
they built this whole thing in a matter
of like an hour so i didn't even manage
to get footage of the actual setup so
they're just putting the finishing
touches on it now this is their latest
handheld gaming system I haven't
actually used one yet but hopefully I'll
be able to sort of say something more
intelligent about it a little bit later
apparently i'm partying now msi an ocz
are back-to-back here they're both going
to have really cool demos of their
respective technologies to msi we're
going to be putting together their test
bench showing their one button o see
Jeanie overclocking or you can try it
see how easy it is in real time and o
TVs has a live number where they have
two identical notebooks each with a
different storage set up one with a
vertex for SSD in the other with a hard
drive so you can do the pets you
challenge so to speak and try it to see
whether you can tell the difference for
yourself and last minute set up is the
definitely the domain of the NCIX PC
team we get things done no matter what
you can see we've got our flagship I one
system here at the intel booth with
the gtx 690 running inside looks
absolutely amazing what's going to get
back so remember guys this is the carbon
fiber wrap system that is pretty much
balls to the walls pre overclocked core
i7 3770k gtx 690 and it doesn't get much
faster than that and last but not least
we don't believe an event like this
would be complete without some pretty
sweet deals so we've got like sort of
dim sum menu style a bunch of the show
deals that are available there's
actually a second page as well so just
going to pan through this really quick
can always pause if you really want to
read them don't forget you have to be
here at the aberdeen mall location in
order to take advantage of these deals
and you can see quite a few people have
decided that they are interested in the
deals and they want to come check out
the fair as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
