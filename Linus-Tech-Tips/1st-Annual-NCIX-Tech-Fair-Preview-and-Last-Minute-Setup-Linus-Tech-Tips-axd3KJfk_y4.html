x-pac fair we're just doing like some
last-minute preparation before
everything gets started you can see the
pages set up we're in Aberdeen centre
here and we're going to take you around
and show you some of the booths that are
in the process of getting ready to go
remember in Aberdeen Centre Mall in
Richmond Saturday Sunday May the 12th
and 13th come check it out during the
day
for more information you can visit
www.sap.com/learnbi tech fair or NCIX
dot e OT comm on facebook for more
information
a soos is here is one of our cotton
sponsors so they're showing off a wide
variety of different things and hidden
gaming systems monitors motherboards
networking and soos makes almost
everything so definitely you want to
check that out we're here at the galaxy
in didya joint booth they kind of pulls
together and a few tables so that they
could set up together so they're gonna
have a couple really cool gaming setup
so going to show 3d and large format as
well as what they've got some heaven
benchmarks running here on a
so that's another thing you're gonna
want to make sure that you definitely
come and check out and there's also
great prizes you can win
we've got tablets TVs Xbox and a variety
of other things over $10,000 and prizes
to give away but you do have to come out
to the show and fill out one of these
forms and put it in the old fishbowl in
order to qualify here's the Samsung
booth never one to be upstaged when it
comes to awesome demo so we're gonna
take a closer look at a couple of things
they have inside here at the Samsung
booth there's tons of cool stuff
including their new series 9 central
station monitor so this reduces the
cable clutter at your desk as well as
delivering their latest pls panel
technology in a super high resolution
last sleek looking front panel format
this looks like a beautiful monitor as
you guys know I'm a huge fan of their
existing pls monitors so it could only
get better with time we've also got a
couple of series 7 tablets this one's
running Windows 7 but they're actually
gonna have one set up running Windows 8
preview as well so you can take full
advantage of the touchscreen
capabilities we've got a wide variety of
other stuff including their latest TV
tech
even some printer about six notebooks
that you can try out whatever you want
just check it out so see you there oops
pretty blinged up I saw an Peck sort of
swing by here earlier putting their
little LEDs on the table in order to
dress things up a little bit as well as
tidying up the cable management you know
not celebrating our Giga Byte guy here
at the tone is tidy cabling but you can
see it looks pretty slick with
everything all tied up nicely is a nice
cable extensions as well as the antec
920 cooler h2o with the sweet LED
lighting effect where we've come from in
terms of video card technology and how
much more advances these days with the
70 900 series and they also have one
thing that I think is pretty cool is a
bit of a Museum of AMD CPUs going all
the way back to some pretty ancient
stuff from back when AMD used to even
share a socket with Intel now they've
they've definitely come a long way from
that as well they've also got wafer here
showing how these CPUs actually come out
of the manufacturing facility before
they're packaged up like this Corsairs
got there a wide portfolio of products
on demo including their peripherals mice
keyboards headsets as well as cooling
products including my personal favorite
pre-done liquid cooling unit the h1 so
you can actually touch it feel it see
how you like it
don't say they ran but I think we're all
pretty familiar with Corsair around at
this point BenQ projectors and monitors
don't forget they do both they've got
the gp2 here they're a little pocket
projector this is one of the show deals
where you can get it with the battery
pack that runs for about four hours
which is pretty cool I've also got a 3d
vision light boost ready monitor powered
by him an NCI X PC one that we actually
did a video about a little while ago and
Sony really brought everything they
brought they pulled out all the stops
with their PS Vita Bootsy come here
check out the Vita they built this whole
thing in a matter of like an hour so I
didn't even manage to get footage of the
actual setup so they're just putting the
finishing it now this is their latest
handheld gaming system I haven't
actually used one yet but hopefully I'll
be able to sort of say something more
intelligent about it a little bit later
apparently I'm partying now MSI and OCC
are back to back here they're both gonna
have really cool demos of their
respective technologies so MSI we're
going to be putting together their test
bench showing there one button OC Genie
overclocking where you can try it and
see how easy it is in real time
as alive no more they have two identical
notebooks each with a different storage
setup one with a vertex for SSD and the
other with a hard drive so you can do
the Pennsy challenge so to speak and try
it to see whether you can tell the
difference for yourself and last minute
set up is the decimally the domain of
the NCA HPC team we get things done no
matter what you can see we've got our
flagship eye one system here at the
Intel booth with the GTX 690 running
inside looks absolutely amazing let's go
again so you remember guys this is the
carbon fiber wrap system that is pretty
much balls to the walls pre overclocked
for i7 3770k gtx 690 and it doesn't get
much faster than that and last but not
least we don't believe an event like
this would be complete without some
pretty sweet deals so we've got like
sort of dim sum menu style a bunch of
the show deals that are available
there's actually a second page as well
so just gonna pan through these really
quick you can always pause if you really
want to read them don't forget you have
to be here at the Aberdeen mall location
in order to take advantage of these
deals and you can see quite a few people
have decided that they are interested in
the deals and they want to come check
out the fair as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
