this video from CES 2017 learn more
about their rise and processors at the
link in the video description so here in
the Sony booth they've got actually a
wack ton of cool display tech behind me
is Cletus which stands for crystal LED
integrated structure and the main
difference between this and the like
huge display wall or tunnel that every
other TV guy does every year is that you
can buy one of these today so a Cletus
display is made up of a whole bunch this
one's somewhere in the neighborhood of
300 a whole bunch of modular 16 inch by
18 inch panels that can be seamlessly
assembled and then be driven by what
they call a Cletus brain which I think
costs like $20,000 or something like
that anyway the one behind me is driven
by - Cletus brains this display
technology is utterly unique in that it
achieves its fantastic black levels in
part by having almost 98% of the entire
display area be black but looking at it
from here it doesn't make any sense when
you get in close you realize that every
pixel is made up of a tiny red green and
blue LED and the entire rest of the
space is black it's trippy as hell I've
jumped up on the stage and managed to
get within about six to eight inches of
it and the image completely disappears
you move back and it appears it's
actually quite disorienting though I
don't consider it a knock against the
technology because you would obviously
never watch it from that range on Sony's
blog they said it's capable of up to a
hundred and twenty Hertz refresh rates
and it looks absolutely incredible it is
nearly impossible to see the seams with
many types of content now let's talk
things you'd be more likely to actually
put in your living room this is the a1
series bravia tv and it is absolutely
mind-boggling for a number of reasons so
this is Sony's second
OLED TV the first one to actually make
any sense it's available in 65 and 77
inches and they've done a lot of stuff
in here that may
a ton of sense so the first is they're
going for no compromises on the viewing
experience so it uses an OLED panel it
uses their x1 extreme processor which by
the way is completely separate from the
processor that runs Android so it's
exclusively for processing the image and
analyzing the individual panel remember
their manufacturing variances in real
time to get the best possible image
number two is they've gone bezel-less
all the way around even the sony logo is
tiny
how many brands like this have the
stones to pretty much take the logo off
their product and let it speak for
themselves almost none of them won their
one additionally they have instead of
chasing thinness distance from the wall
at all costs gone you know what we're
going to have all the inputs and outputs
and the base amount and everything still
attached to the TV it's okay to be four
inches off the wall which I personally
really don't mind except that hold on a
second how can you call it no
compromises if there isn't even an
integrated speaker have to go by
speakers no this is where stuff gets
like crazy bananas they have turned the
entire glass surface of the TV into a
speaker not just one speaker there's two
vibrating actuators on each side of the
TV so the entire pane of glass and
there's a subwoofer in the base too but
the entire pane of glass actually
vibrates vibrating actuators it actually
vibrates and you might be thinking well
hold on a second Linus you vibrate a
piece of glass sure that'll create a
sound wave but are we talking about mono
sound absolutely not so they have this
demo where a bird goes across cheep
cheep cheep cheep cheep back and forth
you can't go yeah that's working pretty
well and then this crow comes in he's
like God like holy crap it actually
sounds like it's coming from exactly
where the image is no like algorithmic
we got the speaker's over here but it
sounds like it's coming from over there
it's really freaking cool and in terms
of the sound quality I mean that's a big
question mark right so we did a
side-by-side demo in the secret black
room that
apparently very few people have been
going into with a well-respected very
high-end TV they wouldn't let me name
who it is out of respect but let's say
it's an integrated soundbar TV with
which I am intimately familiar and the
difference was astonishing and again I'm
intimately familiar with the TV I asked
for the remote I was like fooling around
it making sure there was no funny
business going on image quality sound
quality this thing is the cat's pajamas
so a huge shout out again to AMD for
sponsoring our coverage of CES 2017
check out the new Vega GPU architecture
which supports a high bandwidth cache at
the link in the video description but
we're going to make that easy for you
it's vega v e dot g a and also be sure
to check out after the uprising on
youtube which we're going to have linked
in the top right corner right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
