coverage over the next little while so
the first one that I'm going to be
looking at besides my so unpopular ipad
2 unboxing is the motorola xoom now
every tablet manufacturer on the Android
side has to find different ways to
differentiate themselves because
remember it's all running on the same
platform Apple has the hardware and the
software to differentiate themselves
from the rest of the market but these
guys actually have to work a little
harder for it so the motorola xoom
features the Tegra 2 processor so that
is a dual-core processor with an
advanced graphics chip built in so this
is an nvidia an nvidia initiative that
they've worked very hard to bring to
market now one of the ways that Motorola
differentiates themselves actually
there's a couple different ways one is
battery life the zoom actually has
exceptional battery life even from my
personal experience with it and the
other is the accessories so there's a
ton of actual Motorola official
accessories you don't have to rely on
keepo third parties to necessarily make
the accessories that go with it so i'm
going to show you guys the zoom up close
as well as some select accessories here
including a bluetooth keyboard the
protective portfolio case the speaker HD
dock these are all motorola accessories
as well as the regular doc which i have
it mounted on right now so let's have a
closer look at the unit itself it uses a
dual core tegra 2 as i mentioned before
it has a 10.1 inch that is a 1280 x 800
resolution screen so it is capable of
displaying 720p content on it ok let's
chitchat let's check out what we got in
terms of physical attributes here so we
have our power in this is an HDMI output
we've also got USB okay so moving around
that appears to be a microphone on the
other side pretty much nothing very
clean overall look we've got a headphone
port as well as in micro SD slot now at
the time of doing this video see there's
your microSD placeholder the microSD
slot is not yet enabled but there is
some
functionality that's coming very very
soon so I've note is the fact that right
here on the back we have a 5 megapixel
as well as HD video camera so that is 5
megapixel still images and 720p video we
have a flash we also have stereo
speakers and there is your power and
unlock key you got a little motorola
logo there okay on the other side we
find volume buttons now one of the
things to note about this tablet is
clearly meant to be used in portrait
mode because you can tell this the
volume buttons are here the camera is
here so when you compare that to the
ipad 2 for example which has the camera
here and has your volume control here
that's meant to be used more in portrait
mode because it's widescreen this is
what's going to deliver the most
satisfying overall experience so one of
the things like I said that really sets
the zoom apart is the fact that here
what's a good example why don't we use
actually you know what no this one's not
as impressive let's do let's do this one
right here we're going to run Riptide on
the hdmi output so it is as simple as
plugging this this is actually a
motorola hdmi cable into the although
its standard kadavo you can just buy one
and then you can you can use it into any
monitor or television and you can play
games from your tablet on the big screen
whether it's a monitor or a TV so here
we are we're getting started you want to
watch you want to watch the screen there
so so check this out Tegra 2 allows us
to play way way more graphically
intensive games then the then the
processor on the iPad to our iPad one
especially but even the ipad 2 so you
can see here that this is running very
you know 3d lots of water effects and
all that good stuff it looks much more
impressive actually when you put it up
on the bigger screen versus on the
smaller screen just because you can
really see the amount of detail that
goes into it and
we can cut off thats ok so next let's
have a quick look at the protective
portfolio case which I have not actually
yet seen so it actually has like a
rubberized feel to the outside it be
very very difficult to accidentally drop
it the outsides are hard plastic so
that's going to protect you from above a
small incidental fall but nothing major
ok how do you use your motorola xoom
portfolio comes with a little
instruction thing so you know what let
me let me get mount this in then I'll be
back took me only a couple seconds to
mount it you basically just snap the
unit in and now I have it in its
carrying case it's actually a little bit
smarter than apples carrying case now
the device does not wake when you open
it but personally have no problem
pressing a button at the back to turn on
the device when I'm going to use it so
I'm not too worried about that
particular functionality but it does do
a few things that are kind of cool first
of all you want snap the bottom half of
it just like that not turned off ok
maybe that would be a handy feature ok
and then you just go like this so you
want to use it flat you fold it on
itself just like that hook it in there
now you are able to use the tablet flat
you're able to access all of your
buttons and you are ready to go ok
couple of things you want to use a high
viewing angles so this would be ideal
for watching movies for example if
you're putting it in front of you on a
plane on your tray in the upright
position or whatever the case may be sit
and watch movie or if you want to use it
in a more a laptop s kind of environment
then what you can do is you can go ahead
and you can mount it like that now all
of a sudden you can type on it using a
wireless keyboard and with the upcoming
firmware update to 3.1 we are not only
going to get that micro SD slot enabled
but we're also going to get support for
not only a keyboard but also a mouse at
the same time
did you turn off yeah are you sure oh
all right so pairing up the keyboard was
just a matter of okay well now the
device is going to stand by but pairing
up the keyboard was just a matter of
turning on Bluetooth and now I can
navigate around inside the menus I mean
if I didn't wanna use the touchscreen
which is actually a little easier I mean
what the keyboard is actually for is for
typing so this okay will accidentally
hit a cute the beginning but this
keyboard is actually pretty comfortable
okay go on talking while i type so it
makes it lots more difficult but the
responsiveness is good the the comfort
is quite nice it's very very low profile
so you can actually pack it around with
you and it takes standard double A
batteries so you don't have to worry
about recharging it if you run into
trouble you can just buy some double A's
and you are good to go it also has all
of the usual Android short key shortcut
keys so you got your home button you've
got chat you've got the market you've
got your gmail music internet volume
play so media controls all of that good
stuff actually don't know what this
button does okay so that brings out the
context menus so when you have the most
functionality that's going to come in
3.1 update then I think we're going to
be in a situation where the
functionality is dramatically improved
because now all of a sudden just by
carrying a little mouse little bluetooth
mouse and this skinny keyboard you can
have all of those extra input options so
the last thing I'm going to look at is
the HD speaker dock now our last big
accessory here is the HD speaker dock
and what this allows us to do is doc it
the same way we would on the normal doc
which is weighted in powers and charges
the device this has all of that
functionality as well but this one adds
external speakers to the zoom which are
actually quite loud distortion-free
and definitely make for a satisfying
gaming experience okay let's also have a
look at the other functionality of the
HD speaker dock though check this out so
you got your your speaker here you can
see it's substantially larger than the
regular doc it is also powered by a an
inline power brick like this and you
also have support for the HDMI out
whereas the regular doc actually blocks
the HDMI port you do not have support
for HDMI out using that one the HD
speaker dock is also compatible not only
with the zoom by itself but you can also
take it off and you can switch the
mounting piece so that instead it is
compatible with the zoom in its case so
it adds a little bit of extra buffer
space around the back so you can put it
in on the carrying case so thank you for
checking out my overview of the Motorola
Xoom don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from unboxings reviews and
other computer videos actually this is
more of an overview of the zoom
accessories i'll be looking more in
depth at the zoom itself on NCIX tech
tips in the near future as part of a
tablet roundup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
