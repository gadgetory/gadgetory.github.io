powering our our nab coverage this year
check them both out at the links in the
video description it's not often that a
camera support company really grabs my
attention from the rest in the same way
edelkrone has this year at nab so let's
take a look at what they had to offer
starting off with their products that
caught my eye the most the edelkrone jib
plus add-on to small camera cranes now
you might be thinking brandon jibs are
difficult and complicated to set up and
use especially for someone just starting
out and while I typically agree with
this point the jib plus aims to make
operating a jib exceptionally easy the
system is made up of three main
components the controller the sensor
module and the 2xs camera head with an
integrated focus motor and I'll chrome
designed the system for basically anyone
to just pick up and start shooting
essentially what you do is to first
manually aim the camera at your subject
and set your first target point then you
move the entire jib arm to a drastically
different location and manually aim the
camera at your subject up again and set
your second target point once you have
those two points set it can then figure
out the entire 3d space around your
subject allowing you to move the jib
wherever you'd like while the head
automatically adjusts pan tilt and focus
to perfectly hold your subject position
in the frame if the focus is not correct
you can manually adjust it using the
controller allowing the unit to learn
the necessary focus points and pull
focus for you throughout your move
freeing you from the daunting task of
both operating the jib and automatically
pulling focused simultaneously to be
clear this is not using any form of
in-camera auto focus the camera is set
to manual focus leaving all the focus
pulling to the jibs to access head
moving on to ll Crone's newsstand plus
which is a friction based camera stand
that allows you to easily set your
camera at various Heights quickly the
system is not made to make pans or tilts
but to very quickly get static or
overhead shots of your subject with ease
I see the stand plus being very useful
for product shots like demonstrating
features of a smart
or forgetting wide static landscape
shots with the flexibilities to get
different perspectives
without fiddling with tripod legs you
are able to adjust the friction of each
joint to fit your needs for both the
amount of force you want to put on and
the cameras weight the stand plus folds
up fairly compact Li and includes three
wheels for easy movement great for
studio situations just like we have back
at the office
the last product for metal cone that we
saw was a product they're calling the
Povey which aims to make shooting your
point of view super easy with a
smartphone you simply attach the
included adhesive magnet to the back of
your smartphone and stick it to the PO V
giving you this really interesting
first-person perspective to whatever you
might be doing I could see this being an
interesting tool for live-streaming
while keeping your hands-free to
continue working on whatever you want to
share whether it's showing a relative
what you're cooking for dinner that
evening or using periscope to work on a
DIY project the Povey also allows tilt
to change the camera's position to find
what best suits your situation I simple
but very nice touch thanks again to
Sennheiser for sending us here to nab
this year make sure to check out all of
their new stuff for nab at the link in
the video description also thanks to
Kingston for sending us here this year
check out their brand new superfast
micro SD card made for action cameras
like the GoPro also linked in the video
description so thank you guys for
watching let me know in the comments
down below what you think of these three
very simple pieces of gear and how you
might use them personally and for all
the rest of our NAB 2016 coverage don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
