telling us for years that thanks to
features like portrait mode they are
good enough to replace a standalone
camera well I think that is a load of
crap but I do realize that even if I
gave up these stylish belt holsters for
free convincing everyone they should
carry around a proper camera like my
Fuji xc2 isn't uphill battle so since
you guys are going to use whatever is
already in your pocket I guess I need to
spend some time figuring out which one
of these is closest to good enough and
speaking of good is no tax Magnus en
1070 mini gaming PC comes VR and
triple-a game ready check it out in the
link in the video description
I want to start off by saying what this
video is not it's not a scientific
analysis it doesn't cover every aspect
of the performance of every one of these
phones and I didn't even touch on video
and it is not even a representative of
the best work I could do with them as an
imaging professional what it is is a
collection of my thoughts from using
these cameras in a wide variety of
different scenarios as most people would
use them no third-party apps full auto
mode with tap for me doing and focus as
my only manual controls and yes before
all of you go storming into the comments
section I know the v30 has a very
flexible manual mode within their camera
app however with enough time and
tweaking in manual settings nearly any
camera can look great and what I wanted
to see here was an average users use
case for a camera on their phone in auto
mode we also chose to include the iPhone
8 plus in this roundup instead of the
iPhone 10 because our 10 had
unfortunately not arrived yet during the
making of this video let's start by
tackling color in the first shot with
the pink flower the node 8 and the V 30
are both boosting saturation
significantly with the pixel 2 in the
iPhone 8 plus both leaning more neutral
and the pixel 2 being the least
saturated of the bunch
overall the note it captured what most
people would probably describe as the
most pleasing image without editing but
the iPhone wins with the most
true-to-life representation of color in
this second set of images the iPhone 8
and the p30 both went for a slightly
warmer white balance on a blueish
overcast day while surprisingly the node
8 has a cooler more neutral white
balance with the pixel 2 being again the
most neutral and d saturated of the 4
here the V 30 gives the sky and the
white part of the wall art a greenish
tint while the noted and the pixel 2
gave fairly similar results though I
give the edge to the pixel to thanks to
its more balanced exposure and color
saturation and truer to life color
reproduction then the iPhone 8 by
comparison looks like someone
intentionally D saturated the image
color wise it's hard to declare a clear
winner that's head and shoulders above
the rest but we do have a loser
the LG v 30 then if pressed I would say
the pixel 2 comes out on top thanks to
its consistent delivery of true to life
color followed closely by the iPhone
then if you prefer a more saturated look
the note 8 performed admirably
here let's compare dynamic range and
overall detail this image was taken from
under the Vancouver Convention Center
with HDR disabled we are evaluating the
sensor here not software stitching
sophistication what separates the men
from the boys here is the detail in the
bottom of the overhang it registers
black on the V 30 with the iPhone 8 and
the node 8 picking up the roof
structural supports but only the pixel
two shows what they're made of wood
zooming in for a closer look the iPhone
8 plus gets the edge in overall detail
but apples denoising looks subjectively
worse than Google or Samsung's to LG's
credit the image has almost no noise but
it also contains almost no detail and an
overall aggressive post-processing
sharpening effect this shot of downtown
Vancouver confirmed a trend for me with
each camera the V 30 and the node 8 on
top of adding much more sharpening in
their processing also both tend to under
expose the image with the V 30 being the
more aggressive of the two looking at
the detail in the bottom of the stairs
here it registers nearly black on the V
thirties image with the note 8 faring
better overall but still underexposing
compared to the iPhone and the pixel to
the iPhone image here while brighter and
holding more detail in the bottom of the
stairs also has some noisy artifacts
under the stairway the pixel 2 strikes a
good balance and overall exposure and
contrast it doesn't retain as much
detail as the note 8 under the stairs
but the rest of the image in the pixel 2
shot has more neutral and true-to-life
colors let's look at low-light in this
test image the V 3 turns in the worst
performance by far not even registering
the tree behind the lamppost then things
get a little interesting the images from
both the iPhone and Note cameras seem to
have compensated for the greenish hue of
the park lighting while the pixel 2 did
not not everyone will appreciate
Google's approach here line has
preferred the artificial composition and
better detail rendition in the tree and
the iPhone image but from a technical
standpoint the pixel 2 lost less detail
in the highlights and once again was
more true to life
I prefer Google's interpretation of this
scene this shot of a pile of tree
branches shows again that the V 30 just
doesn't compare to the other phones in
this round of the pixel 2 and the iPhone
both have a similar overall exposure but
the iPhones cleaner blocks are quite
noticeable in the sky then the node 8
pulls off surprisingly good performance
here there a touch over sharper but
there's a
a lot of detail on those branches I
found the iPhone image most pleasing but
once again the pixel too was the closest
to actually being there I'm going to get
into portrait bro next but first I want
to talk about a couple of things we've
seen so far as I mentioned before the V
30 tends to heavily underexpose the
image of the same scene compared to the
pixel 2 and the iPhone with the note 8
only going about half as far typically
and it's also pretty clear that both LG
and Samsung bump up the saturation of
their cameras to deliver what they
consider to be more pleasing photos at
the cost of some accuracy but the
biggest trend that stood out to me was
the iPhones inconsistent metering of
exposure take this low-light HDR shot of
the LMG studio for example the node 8
pixel 2 XL and even the V 30 all
outperformed the iPhone in terms of
holding detail in both the sky and our
office building in the foreground the
iPhone in nearly every comparison I did
tended to be the brightest image of the
4 sometimes to its detriment in a quick
studio test I shot the photo with the
iPhone last and no matter where I tried
to meter the image I couldn't get the
exposure correct without manually combis
hitting in the iPhones app and
surprisingly changing the model didn't
help us get any more usable as someone
who uses manual camera controls
literally every day I'm not saying this
is an unreasonable burden it's just that
every other camera and the roundup
managed to do it better now let's get
into portrait mode the V 30 doesn't have
one at this time so I subbed it out for
the XT 2 to act as a reference point for
how close we're getting to a two
thousand dollar investment in two
dedicated hardware this first shot shows
while the no dates dynamic range really
falls apart in their live focus portrait
mode they did a reasonably good job of
blurring the background but cropping in
on Max's face the image is pretty soft
and noise is heavy the iPhone outdid the
note 8 pretty handily doing a great job
with its artificial bokeh effect and
retaining more detail when we zoom in
the pixel 2 fared best in overall
exposure and detail but Google's
algorithmic single lens processing
technique completely missed the mark on
its def map leaving out the blur effect
on the majority of the right of the
image this second shot has the note 8
coming out really soft in the detail of
the image with a huge loss of
information in the highlights the iPhone
performed better but still feels soft
overall with the pixel 2 missing it's a
blur effect on the bench here but
otherwise really impressing with its
overall exposure and sharp
as a bonus it had the most accurate
color to my eye this third shot in a
field shows yet again that the no date
really can't hold up against the pixels
who in the iPhone with its portrait mode
the skies completely blown out with
Max's skin starting to lose detail in
the highlights again the pixel to
struggles here to blur both sides of the
image with the iPhone doing a slightly
better job there but cropping into the
center of the image it's clear that the
pixel two handles detail and noise much
better than the iPhone does even though
the depth mapping failed on this shot so
conclusion time the pixel two while not
the best in every situation it never
came in third place making it the most
consistent at producing an image that
with some editing or Instagram filters
would likely please anyone using it the
iPhone has the clear edge when it comes
to believable fake blurred backgrounds
and most close to the pixel - and
basically every other way and I'm
awarding it second place unless you're a
portrait mode fanatic but I don't want
to make it seem like the nobody has a
bad camera it doesn't Google Apple and
Samsung have all done a fantastic job
this generation as for the V 30 what can
I say we love the folks at LG they're
very nice people but at this price their
camera leaves a lot to be desired but
