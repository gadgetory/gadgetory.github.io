bang for the buck PC but they have to do
it without internet they've got three
days to do it and on the fourth day we
find out who the winner is in this
edition of scrapyard Wars brought to you
by D brand day - first order of business
is to make our sponsor facepalm and
cringe at the same time by attempting to
remove the D brand skin that's on my
daily driver blade stealth and remove
the skin that's on the unit they sent
with their new camo pattern for me to
use and then put this back on there
without destroying anything oh wait my
justification for this I'm demonstrating
how D brand skins can be removed from
your device's without leaving any
residue because I don't want to
reinstall all my crap on another laptop
this is not this is not going well this
is not gonna be reusable okay okay fresh
idea just everybody oh wow yeah fresh
idea swap the boot drive I just wasted
15 minutes but possibly gained myself
back 20 that my friends is time
management please turn on no I don't
regret it
this was theoretically a good way to
save time it just didn't work out that
way and you can't regret things that you
could only have known in hindsight I had
no way of knowing this would happen and
it worked initially it wasn't till I put
the cover on what why did putting the
cover on briquette crap we got to build
a computer so let's just let's just go
I'm just gonna use this one and the
brand will never work with us again
maybe I deserve it I don't I don't want
to buy stuff from Best Buy but one of
the computers there the a10 7800 for
under 200 bucks he's a pretty good deal
it's not like it's not exactly a crazy
processor but at that price point I
think it's pretty damn good for price to
performance kind of stuff that the
difficult part right now is I can't
check they've got a complete tower with
and APU eight gigs ram two gigs or oh
wait I need an SSD okay anyway they've
got like open box and then they've got
final clearance and when it's on final
clearance it looks like if it's final
clearance and an open box there is some
room to negotiate 269 for CPU
motherboard Ram case power supply that's
not bad a parts store let's go to a
memory express or something and see what
they have to say the interesting thing
about this challenge is that it's making
us try new strategies and ones that you
might not think of like it's crazy how
different Best Buy looks and walking
around in that store there's nothing to
indicate that there's a deal to be had
in anyway you have to go and talk to
somebody actually we might not have to
go all the way to memory express I think
Canada computers took over all of NCIX
as old leases so theoretically there's a
Canada computers here
it would appear that this lease was
legitimately so terrible that nobody
wanted it nope this NCIX still holy crap
wow these guys just straight-up came
over here my god well they're closed
let's just put our sign on that you know
what let's go they're very interesting
store almost zero overlap with what NCIX
used to sell and the first thing they
told me when I walked in the door was no
if you're looking for a computer
hardware go to Memex ok do you have any
used power spice what size like 500 600
that's maybe not a bad idea but I'm
trying to see I don't see the other
cable harnesses so let's do one graphics
card 875 yeah yeah I might uh I might go
for that thirty bucks okay 875 Watts
thirty bucks probably gonna end up
coming back and getting that but I want
to make sure that I get the rest of my
build before I start actually buying
things and he said he can hold on to it
for me it looks like it's been sitting
about for a while it's probably okay if
you go down the rep beside us behind us
there's a store you'll see lots of
graphics cars ok hi there I know you
guys are more cellphone focused but I'm
trying to ask around to see if anyone
has spare computer parts um I know this
is more cell phone based but hi I know
this is more cell phone based but I'm
looking for individual components for a
computer it's only Tuesday so I'm not at
this point yet but there's still time
okay so they've got a pretty clever
strategy for dealing with open box stuff
here basically because they're a system
builder as well they negotiate with
people who are buying systems to include
their open box hardware inside the
system that way whoever buys the system
gets a small this
count but they don't have to discount it
as much as they would have to if they
were just selling open box hardware
because they would have to open
something for a system and they would
have to test it to make sure it's
working anyway so that's great for
memory expresses business but it does
nothing for us because they have
literally no open box video cards or
power supplies which means we'd be
paying full retail and it turns out even
a gtx 1050 at full retail price is
freaking expensive I don't know how
we're gonna find a good deal on a
graphics card oh I left my water bottle
in there someone's following me oh thank
you I appreciate that
whatever system I'm gonna end up with is
probably not gonna have an SSD and it
just occurred to me that AMD has a
software called sin semi or something
like that that lets you use an SSD to
accelerate your boot hard drive ten
bucks
ok is that how much you would charge
anyone who came in and wanted to buy it
ok well I'll pay you ten dollars then so
for better or for worse we've got a 64
gig SSD this definitely gives us enough
to install an OS install for at night
and run the whole thing off SSD or in
the event that we get a system that
already has a hard drive in it I think I
can use it to accelerate the hard drive
so one way or another we were gonna need
an SSD and at ten bucks the price is
right right thank you good sir pleasure
doing business with you and take care
you're gonna need that ten dollars just
leave that there okay
excuse me do you know this is a maybe a
slightly offensive question to ask east
what do you know where memory expresses
No okay I just moved yet recently so
okay I know we're in snow but it might
not be but she lives the other yeah okay
where's that the one that the whole
games yeah it's a movie it's like a very
good
okay okay okay sweet okay thank you duh
okay so I'll go there do you know where
MMX is though as well go to both memory
Express number three Road okay good
enough perfect thank you very much sweet
key squad just forever helpful this
season of scrapyard wars if you haven't
figured it out already is brought to you
by D brand their new Nintendo switch
skins are available now and you can also
order tempered glass screen protectors
these things look great and they're
scratch resistant to keep you from
damaging your device
learn more at the link below uh hi a
question for you do you guys deal in
secondhand Hardware at all really oh
okay um do you have anything that's kind
of like older gaming system me you know
what I'm really close I might just pop
in I'm just gonna part we're just gonna
have to get out and look for it oh hey
there Deb what's a computer den
interesting this isn't the same place
but we could pop our heads in oh oh no
this is it
they just must have changed their name
from Cloverdale computers to computer
den alright okay so this power supply is
nothing special it's it's an Acer it's
an Acer special that's what I would call
it no PCI Express power connector the
2600 nada K so we wouldn't be doing any
overclocking and how firm are you on the
599 price for this guy I don't want to
be like I don't want to be rude or
anything but like that's not worth
anywhere near
the sticker like not even close a
fraction of it yeah like 500 gig hard
drive worthless okay we're getting
that's closer okay good we aren't
speaking the same language then yeah
okay okay because I said tonight can I
poke Mike can I poke my head around it
any of these other things like what like
what do you what do you got going on
here I mean some of this stuff is pretty
pretty bad yes yes oh let's go with that
word all right okay so tell you what we
will I'm gonna go I'm gonna go Scout a
bit more but there's there's potential
here okay all right you guys have been
fantastic thank you very much we will we
will talk again okay sounds good okay
take care
so the situation there is they've
actually got a couple of v2z on like
pretty old but it's got a pretty high
clock speed so it turbos 23.7 I think
they had it labeled but I'd have to
double-check that and then they've also
got a second gen core i7 so that would
be it's a 2600 and the labeled prices
are way off like way off like they
wanted like $900 for the Xeon thing and
like $600 for the core i7 box and these
are without graphics cards or without
useful ones but when I was like Gotham
and all of a sudden things got quite a
bit more reasonable we might we might
have a lead here I do want to scout
around a little bit more though if we
can get a good deal on a tower then the
next order of business is finding a
graphics card and on the surface this
seems simple but in practice it turns
out it's actually really hard if you
know anybody who knows anybody who has
something that that would be super cool
thank you okay sounds good thanks hi do
you guys deal in used parts at all
rather than making me feel old though
this whole experience makes me feel a
lot closer to the younger generation
with their snapchats and their Twitter
Grahams and all that then to the older
generation that you know actually does
look for information in here
hey do you or anyone you know have a
graphics card you're looking to sell a
530 that's not worth $50 sorry
thanks anyway so we're on our way to
Surrey micro net and I just realized I
left my water bottle like my nice vacuum
insulated water bottle at the computer
den so one way or another we have to go
back there it'll either be to make a
purchase or it'll be for like the walk
of shame hey I said I might buy
something I'm not going to buy the way I
need my water bottle back peace oh wow
someone's calling who's this oh wow this
might actually be something hello is
that like a second hand Carter is that
brand new
uh-oh okay so um would there be a
discount because it's not new
okay what's your address so I tell Eddie
look we're in Central City which is a
lot better than it used to be but like
don't leave anything valuable in the car
a walking away I'm like sorr anything
valuable Macari goes well you know that
battery is worth a few hundred dollars
nothing of value in the car
even my DualShock 2 controllers
borderline here okay so in summary he's
got a gtx 570 and a radeon 6870 each for
under a hundred dollars plus tax so 95
bucks unfortunately at least according
to the shopkeep because I can't verify
this online he figures that the 6870 is
about equivalent to a modern 750
unfortunately I haven't heard back from
buddy with the used 1070 since I told
him that I really need a price before I
drive all the way out there but it is
used so there's at least some haggling
to be done but like if he makes me drive
all the way out there just to find out
that he wants a Dornier retail for this
thing that's gonna be a real waste of
time okay so if bro who won't give me
pricing over the phone needs me to go
there we've got to go all the way to
43rd and Fraser which oh no yeah that's
really far that's like 45 minutes at
least
Canada computers now open we made it to
be weird walking into an old ncx
location looking for SSD power supply
and graphics card probably just SSD
Goff's card though
Perez's d don't get too excited I want
your worst thing that you have our main
leads right now are the computer that
was forgotten in the back of the
warehouse in Best Buy that we're getting
a ludicrous deal on a power supply from
some random dude that got pulled out of
an alien we're in Crystal mall the
derpiest least-expensive SSD I've like
ever seen from Canada Computers 44 888
dollars yeah dude that's awesome ly
horrible this looks like the worst SSD
I've ever seen we have with no that's
perfect that's absolutely perfect okay
so Canada computers we found a 128
gigabyte muskan SSD looks like it's
probably not very good but that is
perfect for me and it's $44 and 88 cents
which is actually a really good deal so
far out of all the different places I've
been to also we found a 1063 gig again
really junky 1063 gig but it's only 320
bucks so those two things put together
is quite cheap and a 1060 should easily
be able to handle fortnight and
everything else that were throwing at it
in this competition because we're just
doing 1080p so that's not too bad that
put together with the $30.00 power
supply that we found in Crystal wall and
the platform from Best Buy with the a-10
is a pretty cheap pretty good setup
because we're looking at like so 4430
we've had the 600 ish dollars so we were
just leaving Canada computers and we
accidentally found a memory express
which is like right this way so memory
express was super helpful they had
really similar prices to Canada
computers which is not surprising I was
able to find a 500 watt power supply for
fifty-five dollars so probably gonna go
with that 875 that we found at that a
place in crystal ball and a 1066 gig for
400 bucks it might be worth going with
the six gig versions again I'm gonna
have to try to wrack my brain on these
things and kind of figure out which one
I go I don't want to go with more and I
have no idea I like I don't
so maybe to SFU Surrey I talked to the
IT Help Desk which was the plan and he
didn't have anything or have any leads
but he directed me to the computer
science lounge which also didn't end up
working out super well turns out they
kind of semi closed the lounge at like
4:00 we got here at like 4:40
so most people were gone people that
were there didn't have anything it
didn't have any leads and all thought we
were crazy so for us we're gonna end up
buying everything from stores I don't
feel like that is in the spirit of
scrapyard wars but maybe I'm just
failing and Linus is doing really well
I'm kind of hoping that Linus has found
some random person that was walking down
the street and is like yeah I'll give
you a gaming computer for 35 bucks I'm
kidding we are gonna go back to the
computer den and I'm just gonna
negotiate a deal on one of those towers
and I get get my water bottle back
that's so that's that's where I'm in a
bit of a tough place and it's hard to
negotiate when you're sort of far away I
can't ask you to take a loss on it
because maybe someone else that come in
and pay more but we'll buy that for a
lot more money and I don't want to take
away that opportunity but I'm I'm not
I'm not a doofus so I can't pay I can't
overpay for it
so I'll tell you what you you use you
sound like you need a good night's sleep
so why don't we talk to more tired yeah
no she told me she was sick already -
all right
yeah all right so we'll we'll talk we'll
talk tomorrow see if see if you guys can
can help me out here all right you two
thank you I had really hoped those were
just like Salvage machines I don't want
these guys to like lose money on it to
sell it to me but like it's if that
markup is based on what they paid that's
pretty rough I don't think they're gonna
sell it for that either so everyone's
sort of in a rough position right now I
thought we were gonna close out today
with the tower we're going back to the
office after another full day of
shopping having yielded nothing with

description
next time on scrapyard wars and at this
point I have pretty much accepted that
there is a most excellent chance that
I'm gonna lose this thing honestly I'm
thinking of just showing up there but
that's a super pushy dick move I don't
like literally two dollars is gonna
break the bank and this one's on a three
dollar sale I'm probably gonna go with
this one yeah can we Ania grab sky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
