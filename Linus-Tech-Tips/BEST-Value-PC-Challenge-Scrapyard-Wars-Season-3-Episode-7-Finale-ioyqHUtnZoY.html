brought to you by D brand I can run now
I hope got based on Nick coming in and
asking if we're supposed to be done I'm
thinking Austin is not done he walked
over to me and was like how did you
install windows 7 with 20 minutes left I
was like pretty sure he was trolling I
don't mind that like the system's done
like the thing is is like the first time
we did scrapyard wars the benchmark
period included like installing software
yo yo yo yo hold on hold on
pause everything what's going on right
now with install ah well Luke's not
letting me put my front bezel back on
because it's after 4 o'clock what else
software uh we were just talking I don't
even have a way of installing all the
benchmarks I do not know your logins or
anything so I can't do that that's a
good point so I think we should the
software should be fight my computer is
a hundred percent done hardware wise
uh-huh ok
I love how both the other contestants
are taking more time to do yo the can
you put the camera down it's fine I
didn't totally just accidentally install
32-bit windows so I'm currently
installing 64-bit windows did not
realize that there was a 32-bit windows
thing on that key so I think the troll
system deserves to see the light of day
so who's gonna put all this in here
there's nobody look we're not coming
through with any kind of monster
computer or anything
the car's not helping much so we've
decided to do the unveil in two stages
stage one we unveil the hardware stage
two we all run our benchmark scores
there for unveiling the performance
stage three we unveil the prices that we
paid so Austin you're up first
alright so introducing
the greatest system I've ever built
that's not saying much
Oh what I doesn't have a power supply on
the top it has a cars flying top because
it has two power supplies okay so
basically you guys just seem shocked and
amazed you know what I get it I was
going to do that oh really
if I had gotten that graphics card oh
that was the component that I knew you
had Rui I called the guy and I was like
can I come get it first and the guy's
like no I already told him I'll give it
to him so unless he doesn't show up you
can't have it but I'll tell you what if
he doesn't show up by 2 you can have it
so is it and he goes and he goes but I
don't think he's gonna show up he's got
a California number you totally got me
all right so this needs some serious
power this power supply is purely for
the graphics card yeah which is it is a
69 9 I saw that I actually almost went
for that that's 60 90 so we got talking
dual GPUs we also have a core i7 2609
other boards not overclockable either so
it's pretty much like if it works at
stock I'm gonna be really happy with it
that is the scrap inator there you go
all right intro alright well alright
this looks awesome
this oh this my machine is called the
scrap hole because it's where I buried
all the extra hardware that I ended up
with
Wow so I'll start right now I'll start
at the top this is an IP IB LLB LGA 775
motherboard ddr2 my friends
unfortunately it doesn't support the
Pentium 4 processor this works by the
way at least it did before I did that to
it this is a vintage USB 2.0 expansion
card this is a broken Audigy - this is
the most disgusting piece of hardware
that I have ever laid eyes on
it smells the computer we pulled this
from literally had a used crack pipe
inside it nice VV it's awesome litora
that's good that's a good thing this is
a working 9500 GS this is a working 6850
this is a sound blaster live also dead
this is a heatsink
so you found some way the army of hard
drives you found some way to go to an
actual scrapyard and get all this stuff
for basically the hard drives may or may
not work I'm not sure under there is a
Pentium 4 processor really this Ram
I borrowed so this actually is not I did
not obtain the RAM and that Foxconn
Board I don't know it made those beeping
sounds you heard earlier but you don't
have RAM in your system now because but
no you can't add anything now what oh he
has another computer what is this I
think this is all just a waste BC and 16
it looks like a fairly decent card I
think he has a whole nother
because I think he went to a scrapyard
and like actually got all this done for
like basically this is the leaning tower
of scraps uh why do you have two full
computers this is my actual computer why
don't you just lay it on its side
why do you lean it I like it this way so
there's yeah there's no reason okay
oh this this is my Q 6600
yes I went Q 6600 again four gigs of
ddr2 memory there okay
my 7970 ghost that was actually modded
by the original owner believe it or not
this commando rog motherboard was
literally pulled out of a scrap pile of
motherboard this is what i'm saying he
found somewhere he says like $18 on this
entire rig literally well I have a 7970
I mean come on okay so 25 yeah so that
my friends is the leaning tower of
scraps so can I just ask a question rip
what's the deal with all this stuff if
you have this computer we can't ask you
what price right now but you get to some
crap jump place and gone with a bunch of
this and you said this is a Radeon 1650
that's a 1650 it works but I'm factoring
all this into my price
okay so I'll get the scrap whole out of
the way it does actually really sting
Rose I knew it oh I knew it
yes legally told you there must be some
stupid-ass question on the first day
basically this isn't why is there
fishing line on it so handsome
I like this immediately so it's it's a
queue 6,600 I wasn't supposed to have
one of those I was supposed to have a
different processor then that guy bailed
on me so I like scrambled and was able
to get this this is a BFG tech fox but
yeah scrap yard wars we'll be right back
after these messages
this episode of scrap yard wars is
brought to you by D brand makers of the
precision cut vinyl skins that you'll
see on the phones and notebooks of our
contestants they offer a wide variety of
styles and colors and support for the
coolest devices including the
PlayStation 4 galaxy note 5 and iPhone
6s protect the body of your devices and
make them look great at be brand calm
slash scrapyard Wars here we go
benchmark number one Cinebench r15 three
two one go
and I think we all know who is winning
this one yeah maybe this possibly oh
yeah we have eight threads which is sort
of an issue isn't Austin so this is I
spent a fair chunk more on this i7
almost entirely for this test so
hopefully I beat you guys by a lot cuz I
I'm feeling pretty good I'm crushing
Luke yeah actually what's going on I
think don't you guys have the same CPU
yeah mine has some issues 615 and to
John's 316 almost double 316 for Linus
here that likes 267
367 that's not bad alright so our first
benchmark scores are in shall we run PC
mark next yes that's good
ready three two one go
okay I'm counting on Austin's like
crashing or something because he's gonna
crush the PC mark score as well
has crashed so what do we do now I don't
know do I get to try one more time
because I've had it run I think it's
fair
technically says he has to immediately
talk to you I think I'm gonna I'm gonna
be able to leave me on this one mostly
cuz I also want a little lenient if I
have some issues in a minute so that was
mainly your rule I heard you're the one
that was hard for I know I just I don't
think that's why it crashed yeah so
what's what's the deal with this doesn't
that look great yeah yours the students
that might be because of your Georgie do
you think it's just like nah no that's
part of the image manipulation
benchmarking no is it's not doing that
this is what mine looks like yeah
li-ming's super screwy look at that yep
I guess I gotta I guess I got a dial
back to my overclock Wow turn it off yep
which is food yeah which is really chewy
smoothie duty just in general it's a
good life skill to be able to turn that
off so do I get to keep my Cinebench
then yeah I think because it works it
completed that test but his system isn't
stable so I failed my PC mark run which
means I had to reset my CPU overclock
taking me from 3.2 to 2.4 gigahertz
which in Cinebench basically amounted to
about two-thirds of the score that I got
now we're gonna have a look at our PC
mark results how are we gonna submit
results are we just saving yeah click
Submit results and let's find out how
much it affected me in PC mark my score
2-0 that does not sound up particularly
right oh okay so Austin's machine
straight up dirt and I apparently
crushed Luke but that's
how is your CPU image manipulation hard
drive importing pictures of windows
photo gallery yes I just all the SSD
paid off hard core you just got creamed
alright 3dmark fire strike time let's do
it go now
we decided that unless Austin's actually
in contention which I don't think either
of us really thinks it's gonna happen on
this side table here unless Austin's
actually in contention we're just gonna
throw out his PC mark score
it just wouldn't finish so we'll see how
the rest of it goes if he's in
contention it's likely we'll assign him
a similar score to what Luke asked your
C for you is probably nothing when
crossbars all right I guess it is that
it's easy yeah okay so
Oh like Luke's crushing us both
don't worry about there's the CPU
opposing it was in my second testing
launch water turning burgers go Jordan
hope not it says running system info
though what does that even mean you're
on is this a physics one so you're
probably oh wow that's really good
that's super good that's gonna crush
your score yep let alone now it's a lot
slower uh Wow yes you just crash dude
yeah oh wow rip what does how to reset
your graphics no no oh I'm running at
stock settings
alright I'm in the second test hmm yeah
I get but it's always happy there was no
lower enthusiasts yeah the reenactment
was flawless
okay so let's put Astin scoring five 46
55 80 hi are you barely baby
I beat Austin by higher strike 55:46
sources 5588 that's pretty close alright
watch your ears so uh looks a little
behind be fair away do you
which is exactly where I like him so
let's go ahead and Austin and I are
gonna start the Tomb Raider benchmark
right hmm well that's lower than woah
that's lower than I thought it would be
okay no that's on average 109 that's
yeah okay so Austin comes in at 109 even
with me coming in at eighty four point
nine okay all right let's run far cry 4
okay so here's the update we are
swapping out Austin's graphics card with
an r9 270 to rerun PC mark and give us
approximately the equivalent of if this
card were to run with a single GPU what
his PC mark score would be we know it's
an approximation but the cold hard truth
is nobody actually runs PC mark Vantage
so who cares we're gonna live with the
approximation on Luke system we are
running him off of an uninterruptible
power supply to condition the power
because I've seen this before we're
cheap power supplies we'll actually be
able to handle a system but won't be
able to handle crummy power coming off
the wall which with all these systems
running off the same outlet may in fact
be the case here we don't want to
penalize him for bad wall power for my
system we are apparently rerunning my
Sinha bitch I was doing it so there was
I was doing it so that there was
something running but otherwise I have
completed all of my benchmarks 67 11 he
got a score okay do I get my OC back I
don't know man
it's cuz the UPS is dirty wall power is
that fair it had nothing I think at this
point we always need to take a week do I
get another crack with my overclock yes
like that's just like a spiral maybe
that is the dirty wall power okay so
you're gonna ups but 300 yeah come on
we're done here I don't know like what
it's I don't care okay well there's oh
my score wasn't that bad
242 so I'm doing my last test in Far Cry
4 right now yeah it's not running very
well
I don't know why it's not running very
well I think low 40s but I don't know uh
so I'm good these guys hey it's done
it's done and 97-80
oh so even with added SSD I was almost
able to feel mine's just really low on
that one yeah oh man
but you crushed the graphics you do
crush the graphic I think we should let
Luke just use his old benchmark score so
the final scores are Austin with four
hundred and fifty five out of five
hundred points
Linus with 362 out of 500 points and
Luke with 386 out of 500 points so now
all that's left is the cash count
I don't know what any of these coins are
this is a dollar five 989 I just used my
calculator first yeah let me let me do
that real quick I said I spent three ten
I spent two hundred and eighteen dollars
final price per dollar course really
high wait score per dollar higher is
better good job hmm officially rekt
minus one by 40% oh yeah yeah okay let's
go let's go let's go
I had actually this is kind of a funny
story if I had lost by forty dollars I
would have been so mad because the guy
with the Q 6600 offered it to me for 40
and I was like nah man
here's another 20 bucks I'm gonna fleece
you slightly less now I was betting
heavy on my SSD I
I paid $38 for my SSD Wow which is a
good deal still yeah yeah but when you
consider my 238 dollar budget
dude I paid $25 for my 102 gig hard
drive 25 bucks I paid $10 for mine you
got rectangle so okay my motherboard and
CPU I supposed to have a 95 50 and some
other board that guy I showed you I had
18 emails back and forth and stuff just
as useful to bring it to work oh I
forgot it so I had to scramble and find
some other solution this was on the
second day so like there's basically no
way I'm gonna be able to set an
appointment and have that appointment in
the same day I ended up going to free
geek Vancouver which we've been talking
about doing a thing
I got a Q 6600 for 17 bucks what that
motherboards 35 that hard drive was 10
all that Ram was 40 I should have got 4
gigs I think I would have been way more
competitive I got 4 gigs all that ran
was only 40 bucks and that power supply
which actually murdered me and I should
have bought the other one that I was
going to buy from Kevin's stupid website
but it it was 30 bucks ok so
we close this out Austin it was your
first scrapyard wars you came in on
unfamiliar turf how do you feel about
your result I feel like I spent way too
much money
that was the big problem I way misjudge
the budget and I to be totally honest my
build publishing to work like how close
I cut it to actually getting everything
working at the last second like it
should really should not have worked
like the second to reduce my build
shouldn't have worked either the
motherboard would you see how that
motherboard was packed my Paris might
barely works we were all yeah we that
happens every time you it's scrap yard
work don't worry about I was like an
hour and a half out like I don't have a
working system I might just like be
disqualified and like just not having
anything to show oh man that was that
was brutal but do you feel good about
not getting disqualify feel so good like
the second I finish the bills like you
know what I don't even care if I come
dead last I just built the system this
crazy contraption it actually works so
happy I'm still happy which is good
because you did come dead last I did all
right how do you feel about your
performance today honestly pretty good
I'm happy with the freaking Vancouver
stuff um I think I actually did quite
well you just got a crazy deal which is
that scrapyard Wars that's totally fair
I just wish I actually bought that
Corsair power supply that's the only
regret I have I would have had pretty
good over clocks and everything he still
would have won I just would've been
happy with my system overall but yeah I
wouldn't have changed much just power
supply so what I would have changed is I
wouldn't have bought an extra $20
graphics card so I'm just gonna for the
sake of running numbers I'm gonna drop
20 bucks off my score here I wouldn't
have tipped the guy 20 bucks that's
crazy I wanna see and my FPS per dollar
score would have been literally more
than double Austin's and would have been
ah about 25% better than Luke's so I
feel really great about my performance
overall did you good job dude yeah as a
purist I really would have liked to find
a working sound device I would have
spent another five bucks to get a
working sound card it is like it's 100
fair because there was no sound
benchmarks but that is if it was a
system you are using this little brew
only everything right yeah um and I
would have liked to spend time properly
on my case I would have liked to present
a more finished build if I'd had a full
another day I also would have built
mitral system cuz it was awesome part of
the problem was I didn't even have time
to install windows on yeah what overall
had fun I've had a blast
it was so much me too interesting
because you don't know what they okay
yeah that was the hardest was honestly I
was getting pretty close to guessing
near the end but the whole time
iteration yeah you had no idea what you
were competing against it was of price
yeah right
why do you were spending what you're
spending oh you're confusing elephants
so thanks for watching guys I hope you
enjoyed scrapyard Wars season 3 we'll
see you again next time
drop a like on the video and subscribe
you know like hey guys alright
awkward new high fives yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
