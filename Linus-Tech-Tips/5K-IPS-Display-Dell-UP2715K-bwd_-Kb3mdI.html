can I actually spent well over a month
with the 5k Retina iMac and while I did
at one point install windows on the Mac
using bootcamp thanks to the IMAX let's
say lack of upgrade ability there were
some experiences that I couldn't
properly evaluate the first time around
the most important of which being gain
performance on enthusiast grade hardware
at 5k something that won't be an issue
in today's video about the Dell u p27
15k monitor the 5k display you may plug
in in any way as long as you can afford
to pay sounds ok let's get started
Corsair h adi GT and h100 IG TX all in
one liquid coolers improve both the
appearance and cooling of your PC click
my face now to learn more we'll start
with the physical overview it comes
packed in an environmentally conscious
cardboard packaging with the panel the
stand and a metric wack ton of cables
two mini DP 2 DP 2 DP 2 DP 1 mini DP
although that's 4k only more on that
later and one USB 3 a 2 B also a power
cable assembly is simple just click the
confidence-inspiring ly well-built metal
stand onto the back of the monitor where
you'll also find the option to use a
standard base amount if you want and
then you're good to go good to go with
what you might ask good question let's
do the physical tour inspect stuff now
starting at the front the u p27 15k is a
27-inch 16 by 9 aspect ratio display
that runs at the other-worldly
resolution of 50-120 by 2880 the 218
pixel per inch IPS panel sits behind an
edge-to-edge sheet of glass that helps
distract from the monitors relatively
large bezels in a world where the mantra
seems to be slimmer is better but then I
doubt most folks will be distracted by
the bezels when they've got that screen
to look at it boasts a contrast ratio of
a thousand to one a hundred percent sRGB
color space
and 99% Adobe RGB coverage with a true
10 bit panel and a 12 bit 3d lookup
table to back it up
oh and on top of all that it features
the full gamut of adjustments tilt
height swivel and auto rotating pivot
hmm
moving to the left we find a Harman
Kardon logo that by itself is completely
meaningless but combined with the
surprisingly decent onboard speakers
built into the bottom of the display
impressed me then further around an SD
card reader whose type is not specified
in spite of the amusing amount of detail
in the Dell manual about completely
irrelevant things like the pin outs of
DisplayPort and USB 3 ports but I have
to assume it's SDXC since they do say
it'll handle up to 1 terabyte cards
either way it's a welcome addition which
brings us around to the back where there
are some simple things like the charging
only USB port here on its own power in
the uplink and for data USB 3 ports one
with a bit more clearance for larger
connectors and a very unusual input
configuration the first thing you'll
likely notice is the absence of anything
but DisplayPort ports with the next
probably being the weird color coding on
one of the full-size ones here's how
this works
if you're insane or just doing it
temporarily I guess then you can plug a
single DP cable into the big blue port
or the mini one but you'll be limited to
4k 60 Hertz
hence the insanity if that's your
long-term plan for this monitor if you
value your money at all and you realize
that if you'd wanted to run 4k you'd
have been better served by a native 4k
display then you're going to want to
plug 2 DisplayPort 1.2 compatible ports
off your AMD Nvidia or Intel graphics
card into both of the full sized ports
make sure you've got the latest drivers
with 5k support and you're going to be
ready to rock my gtx 980 sli test bench
required no extra configuration
plug-and-play baby which I legitimately
wasn't expecting my early experiences
with tiled displays you may have guessed
by now that there are effectively two
separate monitors in here with two
side-by-side tiles since unlike Apple
Dell couldn't create their own t-con and
display interface since I had to work
with standard video cards was not to
positive with the U P 2715 K other than
an occasional half-width bio screen and
longer than normal delay when all
tabbing out of applications I didn't
notice any issues yeh but at this price
not noticing issues isn't good enough it
has to knock your socks off I'll start
by saying I was pretty impressed by the
on-screen menu
lots of modes including a low blue light
reading mode and adjustments including
sixaxis color sliders for the custom
calibration modes although if the
included calibration report is anything
to go by most people likely won't need
them since my monitor managed Delta ease
of less than 2 pretty much across the
board indicating excellent color
accuracy and I didn't notice any
backlight bleed either which was pretty
nice and while I was disappointed that
dynamic contrast ratio cannot be turned
off the built-in dead pixel checker
absolutely blew me away I noticed while
I was digging around in there that the
only options for pixel response time are
normal and fast although I couldn't tell
the difference between them at all
anyway but I actually don't mind that
for a couple of reasons first I never
really recommend cranking overdrive
since I personally find the artefacts on
the leading edge much more distracting
than motion blur behind a moving object
and second because the motion blur on
this monitor is surprisingly good for an
IPS monitor and while I couldn't test
input legs since my tester relies on
HDMI the gaming experience as far as
either of those things are concerned is
great mate but what about trying to game
at that 5k resolution Linus well great
question one word rekt actually okay not
quite that bad it's it's not that bad
but forget about running games at max
details our Tomb Raider 2013 was run at
Ultra with no motion blur ultimate with
tress-fx was a stutter ii mess Crysis 3
managed very high textures and medium
settings across the board and shadow of
Mordor did ok
and very high without motion blur and at
medium textures it should be noted that
in all of these games I turned
anti-aliasing off manually if it wasn't
already for two reasons number one are
you in
my 9 80s were already suffering and
number two is that while at 4k I like
two times anti aliasing at 5k I really
don't see the point at all I seriously
cannot tell the difference and I guess
the word seriously is a great segue into
this conclusion this monitor is a
serious piece of gear for serious users
at least the ones who are serious about
accepting the limitations of it that
come along with its astonishingly sharp
pixel density at 32 inches on the Acer
b32 6hk
I found 4k barely usable but usable
without scaling so you will need scaling
on this one 150 percent was borderline
and 200 percent was great for me and in
Windows I feel like that single-handedly
defeats the purpose of the upgrade in
the old days we upgraded monitors to get
more pixels to put stuff on it made our
virtual workspace is bigger but with
200% scaling there is no advantage in
this regard over a 1440p 27-inch monitor
so when steams game list looks like it's
full of you know titles about 14 4k
warfare it feels like a bit of a poor
investment for such a steep asking price
when you consider that Apple includes a
computer in the package for a few
hundred more bucks if you're willing to
give up some flexibility in terms of
upgrades and that by the time scaling is
pretty much fixed across the board maybe
another couple of years much more
affordable options will be available so
this one professionals only need apply
which can't necessarily be said about
