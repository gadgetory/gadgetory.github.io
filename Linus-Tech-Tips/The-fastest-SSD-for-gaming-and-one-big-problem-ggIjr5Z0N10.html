call it probably for sex appeal reasons
octane now we had a hands-on look at
this technology back in april with these
tiny low capacity models that were
designed to make a hard drive that they
accompanied performed more like a
traditional SSD and it worked pretty
well so since then we've been itching to
get our hands on one of the full fat
obtained drives that intel has been
promising for years and get our hands on
one we did but what does the real-world
performance of a storage medium whose
raw performance is claimed to be up to a
thousand times faster than man flash
look like well let's find out after I
tell you today's video is brought to you
by be quiet the dark bass 700 is
extremely versatile and features RGB LED
lighting plus a tempered glass side
panel window and more check it out at
the link below
the octane 900p is a four lane PCI
Express 3.0 card with an all-metal
heatsink and an easily removable
backplate that's full of helpful
information about the drive on a sticker
but what's more interesting is actually
what's underneath so here we see our
first indication that there is more to
this card than just a PCI Express 2 m
dot 2 converter board like you might
expect then when we flip it over and
gently spudge off the heatsink proper it
reveals more of the same this is
absolutely a purpose-built card and the
comparably immense cooler and beefy
onboard processor should tell you this
SSD means business
which is kind of strange considering the
star citizen promo on the box now you
can learn more about obtained here but
for now the TL DR is this the exact
details of obtains arrangement are a
trade secret but the end result is a
storage latency of a theoretical
thousand times faster than traditional
mend making it only 10 times slower than
in that sense then D Ram
so while Intel's rated sequential read
and write speeds don't even get us fast
as a fast SSD like a samsung 960 pro it
handles significantly more operations
per second with seven times the write
endurance on this consumer product and a
mind splitting 34 times the write
endurance for the data center oriented
obtain P 4800 X making the finite
lifespans of NAND based products a
concern that we can bury in the past so
the high-end video editors and data
scientists out there are salivating
right now because this kind of speed and
endurance makes these larger drives
amazing for use as scratch disks as for
what that means for gamers well intel
says that load times will be
significantly reduced and
suddenly that star citizen promo makes
more sense because this game recommends
a 200 gig SSD so to test this thing we
need a CPU and a platform capable of
taking full advantage of it we chose our
x2 99 bench with a mix of synthetic and
real-world benchmarks our SSDs by the
way were secured raced in preparation
for testing in Crystal disc mark we see
more or less as advertised speeds across
our drives with octane scoring quite a
bit higher on the 4k randoms at a Q
depth of 1 than the others hinting at
its capability for much higher
responsiveness moving on to performance
tests we can see that octane managed
much more consistent latency that edges
closer to but not quite Ram disk levels
of responsiveness this is super
impressive and it's at this point then
that we wondered whether or not obtained
would make a difference for some of the
heavy tasks that we deal with around the
office like editing 8k red video footage
and premiere or rendering with
SolidWorks but as it turns out no no it
does not SolidWorks finished its i/o
test about 4 seconds faster on obtain so
loading or saving would be your primary
benefit here unless you run out of RAM
during a simulation that could be a very
different story and as for premiere well
in a gigantic surprise to no one it is
so poorly optimized for this that when
we simulated a low memory situation with
a 24 gig ram drive it just choked no
matter which drive we had our swap file
or the footage on so then we secured
erase the drives again and copied over
our Steam library to see if we could
spot any differences in game load times
which unfortunately due to the massive
install sizes of many modern games means
that we say goodbye to our RAM disk in
our testing from here on out rebooting
between runs we ended up with well
honestly pretty underwhelming results
compared to the sound song 960 Pro
biggest Delta between them was only a
little over half a second and even our
aging Kingston KC 400 and fashioned SATA
SSD really doesn't do poorly here though
this is another non surprise to people
who pay closer attention to benchmarks
than they do to marketing
one last secure race and an install of
Ubuntu later our final test is Houdini a
piece of software by side effects that
handles physics simulations for the high
end rendering used by big blockbuster
film and game companies our test file
will be a rendering of a maelstrom that
has 1.1 billion particles interacting
with each other so just one frame is
gonna eat our RAM for breakfast meaning
that our RAM disk again is not coming
back as for the rest well to generate 8
frames our 960 Pro Kover an hour of i/o
thrashing while our octane killed it in
just under 29 minutes
as for the KC 400 while we gave it a
participation trophy so then should you
go out and spend $600 on an only 480 gig
octane drive if you're a normal user I'm
gonna come right out and say no because
the chances are pretty slim that you
would ever notice a difference compared
to a traditional nvme SSD and even a
SATA one is probably fine for you in
most cases as for heavier workloads well
maybe if you must have the best of the
best but I'm gonna come out and tell you
again that you are not going to feel a
difference like you did when you went
from a hard drive to a conventional SSD
it's not like that with that said if you
have a real workload that can benefit
from obtains versatility as not just
hyper fast storage like running many
virtual machines off of a single Drive
but also its low latency and lower cost
compared to system memory where you can
use it as an overflow for your RAM like
in our Maelstrom demo well then while
the price of
entry is steep the benefits may just
outweigh the costs
speaking of a very high benefit to cost
ratio tunnel Bayer VPN is the simple to
use VPN app that makes it easy to browse
