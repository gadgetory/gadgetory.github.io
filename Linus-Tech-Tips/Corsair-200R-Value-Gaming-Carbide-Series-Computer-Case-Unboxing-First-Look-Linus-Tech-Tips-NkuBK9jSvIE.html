the corsair carbide 200 R this is nel d
oh you know I shouldn't say lowest end
case although it is the most value
oriented and Corsairs lineup coming in
at a pretty wicked price well under 200
well under a hundred bucks but trying to
still continue to deliver Corsairs
trademark gaming oriented features so
we're going to go ahead and spend a
little bit of time on the outside of the
case by peeling away all of the
information that I am able to find about
the case so easy builds the only time
you'll need a screwdrivers to install
the motherboard something something is
out here yes if we remove the shipping
information then we can read it like yes
haha oh man this something tower form
factor is compact and USB three and no
this is just an awful awful experience
of trying to operate the packaging so
we're just going to jump right into it
and open this bad boy up I've been asked
a number of times in the past why I
insist on flipping the box over to get
back the case from it rather than just
cutting open the bottom of the box and
the reason for that is actually that I
usually store the cases in a big pile so
if I can't keep track of which ones have
the top cut open and which ones have the
bottom cut open at some point I will
open up or I'll pick up a box and the
thing will fall out at the bottom and
that'll be a bad experience for everyone
now this case is a low in case it is
lighter but I'd say Corsair probably
could stand to use a little bit thicker
a little bit more rugged foam on this
one I love to see soft foam but with
these value oriented products I
understand why we're using a molded hard
foam because it is a lot less expensive
on the packaging side now it looks like
I've got the case upside down right now
which is okay because the plastic wrap
it looks like it's also on upside down
so I don't know if that's something that
happens just with the sample cases or
something that happens with all of them
but there you go what we start at the
bottom of the case since that's what
we're doing anyway we have a mount for
120 or 140 millimeter fan rubber feet
keep it from slip
and you've got a fan filter that is
easily we whoops today's is easily
removable for the bottom mounting power
supply fan let's go ahead and flip the
case back around to the orientation that
it's supposed to live in and we'll go
have a look at the front of the case two
USB 3.0 front panel ports headphone
microphone reset switch and power switch
as well as a power indicator LED
wouldn't mind seeing this reset switch a
little bit further away from the power
switch but as long as you're careful you
shouldn't have too much trouble with
that three five and a quarter inch bays
and looks like not a removable front
piece here however the ventilation is
going to come from these holes on the
side and on the side of well the other
side on the side panel huh
it's a good thing we have video to go
along with this because if I was a radio
personality explaining this
I'd be like they'd be like what well
what are their vents on the side are
their fans on the side are there like
children on the side anyway so there's
two 120 millimeter or 140 millimeter fan
mounts above the CPU area and the GPU
area on the top of the case you find ah
this is pretty much the most practical
configuration for these holes so you can
do two 140 s and they'll be right up
against each other and then what
Corsairs done is they've moved the two
120 s a little bit away from the
motherboard tray to give you clearance
for the vrm cooler the CPU block or
heatsink or whatever else is going on in
order to make it so that you can install
an H 100 dual radiator in here without
interfering with any of the other
components inside your system so while
it looks a little bit sort of off-center
because it is when you have dual 120 s
in there it's again very very practical
as as far as ways to approach that goes
this is actually surprisingly
surprisingly thick type panel material
for a value oriented case like this and
the entire interior of the case is a
black painted which is awesome so I'm
just going to take off both side panels
here
and get a really good look at things
they've also got these awesome little
rubber grommets these are great for
noise isolation and what those do is
they easily remove and then they can be
installed in the different holes if
those are the ones that you'd prefer to
use so you see that if you want to use
140 mm your friends you just move all
those around and you'll get that same
noise dampening yeah no matter what size
of fan you decide to use now that we're
inside we can see oh this is convenient
look at that they've actually they're
assuming you're going to install ITX
em ATX which I believe is sort of over
to here or yes these two are removable
actually you see are they yeah some of
them are removable this is removable
this is removable and this is removable
you better remove this one unless you're
installing an m-80 export I wish they
hadn't pre-installed that so be really
careful guys
that'll short out an ATX board but
they've pre-installed the whole the the
standoffs you need in order to install
your motherboard you got a nice big CPU
cutout 120 millimeter rear fan which is
as compatible with a water cooler as
these top 100 and as these top 120 fent
mounts and you can see the way they've
oriented the top 120 s actually leaves
room for a radiator here as well so you
could potentially do a single 120 a dual
120 and then an additional single 120
down here if you've actually wanted to
you could put a pretty beast water
cooling setup in this case in spite of
its price the tool is five and a quarter
inch bays are handled just with simple
tension mounted there's little clips in
there that are going to clip into the
side of the drive so you just pull those
up when you want to slide the drive out
no problems whatsoever the front cooling
is done by a single 120 millimeter fan
so it should get ample airflow from
these from these vents on either side of
it you've got a couple of SSD mounts
actually for SSD vents lots of standing
for SSD mounts here that are just kind
of pressure mounted as well so they
shouldn't yes they clip in from the back
right there so they're not going
anywhere even in shipping and then
you've got four three-and-a-half inch
drives actually a very smart internal
layout this is completely custom chassis
here so I'm going to lay it down for a
second or just a little bit and show you
guys the cable management
and so cable management is going to be
done here for actually for nothing
because the power supply will be there
here for everything that you're going to
run up here 24-pin power for your
optical drives all the power for your
hard drives and all that good stuff and
then well I think that's pretty
self-explanatory here's all your front
panel connectors including something
that I am NOT a hundred percent sure I
guess okay so they've got a nice flat
ribbon cable for the front USB 3 that's
actually the first time I've seen that
that looks really sharp and is going to
be able to bend much tighter do that
then USB 3 cables on other motherboards
that I've seen in the past what's cool
about that is it's going to make your
cable management look quite a bit tidier
again in spite of the fact that this is
a very value oriented case now let's go
ahead and pop out this sorry for being
in my living room here guys but I really
don't have much of a choice right now I
got to get this case unbox immolated so
here we go some cable ties for cable
management some mounting screws for fans
and what not radiators more likely
mounting screws for motherboard in all
likelihood and mounting screws for
optical drives in all likelihood
mounting screws for fans
oh one more rubber grommets in case you
lose some I guess cool
good thinking Corsair and it looks like
yeah these are clippings too so see
there's a there's clipping pieces right
here the way they've done that yeah if
you stand there it's still good there we
go ah the way they've done the coolest
on this case is actually outstanding so
this will clip in and then if you want
more security you can screw it in here
without much difficulty so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at what may be the new sort of
lightweight lightweight champ for for
