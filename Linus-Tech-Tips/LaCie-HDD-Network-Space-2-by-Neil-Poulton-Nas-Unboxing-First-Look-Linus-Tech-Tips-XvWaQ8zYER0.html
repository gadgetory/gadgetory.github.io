mass units lately but this is one from
Lissy which is unique in the fact that
it is designed by Neil Bolton I like to
zoom in on that right there this is the
network space - and Anil Bolton has gone
ahead and designed a black glossy square
box that features torrent downloads
media streaming and up to 65 megabytes
per second Ethernet speed you can see
they've got an aggregate Isis Gigabit
Ethernet and USB 2.0 although I'm not
sure if it works as a USB 2.0 drive
right off your computer yes it does
there you go all right right on the side
it answers that question
so it has USB to connect to a disk key
or printer and then it also has like a
USB B connector there so you can connect
it directly to a computer and use it as
a USB Drive instead of an ass should you
so desire there's a power button as well
as a power input plug Spock all right so
they show you how to connect it how to
access all of your data anywhere using
it and easy set up access download file
even with your computer off centralized
share and backup files at home create
private accounts for everyone in your
household which has like four stars on
it for some reason I'm not sure why
maybe they're just saying that you need
to you know know how to do it or
something
all right so backup iTunes server remote
access eco friendly it has a two year
warranty okay and then on the other side
you've got the box contents which we
will find out in just a moment when we
open cuz that's what we do on this
channel the open boxes or unboxed
product whichever you prefer there we go
spicy spicy whoo very very well tacked
congratulations let's see you have
shipped a very well packaged product
here
I like this closed cell foam that
they're using because it is pretty much
indestructible look at that you can take
it and like drop it and you can tell
there's just there's no there's no give
to it and yet there is it's a very nice
so you're after your heart the last
thing you want to see is a hard drive
that ships from something that's not
sturdy all right
Network space - quick install guide this
is the guide you will want to use to
install it quickly now that's the French
section already so that was it it was
like four pages then we have a network
space to be 1.0 will see utilities CD or
dvd you might want to go ahead and try
that find out if there's anything useful
on it and if there are newer versions on
the Luci website then go ahead and
download them and use those instead
included we have a very fancy looking
Ethernet cable see that mirrored finish
on the side very nice very nice black
pages alright then we have a USB a to b
cable so that's for connecting it
directly to your computer with a USB
drive here we have what appears to be an
adapter although I don't know if I've
seen that standard before
alright then there's another adapter and
then there's the one that I need the
u.s. adapter okay so hey look at that
much money it ships like international
ready already so you just go ahead and
I'm gonna flip that on there well that's
great if you're you're planning to
travel with it or if you're planning to
live in another country other than the
US or Canada and buy one of these it
already comes with other dusters
although I don't recognize either of
these that's ones with with the
cylindrical prongs I've seen some other
one doesn't recognize either of those
maybe you can tell me what country those
are for if you're watching this video
alright here is the network space - so
you can see clearly right here there's a
PCB and connected to all of your inputs
and outputs oh there's your Gigabit
Ethernet there's your USB 2.0 there's a
DC power in alright and then on the
bottom you've got which is kind of a
neat way to do this all of your
certifications and branding and whatnot
is on little rubberized feet which will
prevent the network space too
from moving when you put it down on the
table you can see it is quite sturdy
that's not going to move at all go ahead
and take the plastic off
it is extremely shiny so you can see my
chest mounted tripod cam quite easily
will do the obligatory finger shot here
so you can see just how shiny it is
it is very square and very black well
not really square it's more of a
rectangular prism
so you've caught me on like a holiday so
my hair is like Messier than usual even
and here at the front we find the USB
port which we can use to plug in a USB
thumb drive a printer because it does
act as a print server and then on the
other side we find the Lissy branding so
I guess we might as well do a quick test
with it to find out if their claims of
65 megabytes per second are true or
false
and other than that that's all there is
to really say about the network space
too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
