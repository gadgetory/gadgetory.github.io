West 2016 this year
check out the new blade stealth in the
video description down below so we're
here after the show after everyone has
left to check out the AMD seventh
generation apu processors and am4
motherboards super interesting super
cool but we don't have them here and we
have no videos of them either so we'll
be putting up what slides we can and
other than that it's just me random
footage of us at PAX now the new AM for
platform supports seventh generation AMD
a-series OEM desktops that's mainly what
we're going to be talking about today
although they didn't have information on
what OMS or where you'd be able to buy
them all I was able to figure out was
that at the very least HP is going to
support this at Costco as of right now
they will support seventh generation
processors with a 35 watt and 65 watt
TDP with the 65 watt TDP matching up to
the performance of previous generation
95 watt TDP processors they will also
support new ddr4 memory with up to 2400
megahertz of speed this 35 watt and 65
watt TDP split enables you to go for a
performance angle or a cool and quiet
angle on the platform now this is
currently OEM only support and
theoretically you would be able to
install a Zen processor into this a m4
motherboard I was confirmed with that
from AMD the problem here is that it
might not happen because BIOS support
would have to be given to you by the
OEMs so it's actually rather unlikely
now aim for motherboards will come with
a stack of different chipsets for a
small form factor you'll have AMD xB or
a 300 chipsets
for the essential like workstation PCs
you'll have AMD a 320 chipsets and then
once you start getting into mainstream a
little bit higher performance stuff
they'll have AMD b3 50s now for
enthusiast chipsets we don't actually
have the name of the chipset yet we'll
have to wait till probably the Zen
launch to get that other features that
they're currently calling out our PCIe
gen3 USB 3.1 gen2 nvme support and SATA
Express there is also a huge list of
processors that support a m4
motherboards and they range from about 2
cores to 4 cores loose costs of 3 point
or gigahertz - 4.2 gigahertz on the
graphics out of things you got Radeon r5
upto radeon r7 with GPU see use from six
all the way up to eight and clock speeds
of about eight hundred and forty seven
up to eleven hundred and eight now for
those of you that have been excited for
Zen this is very interesting this is the
groundwork that is being laid out for
the Zen architecture we need that a.m.
for platform support and what's cool is
that these OEMs are going to be rolling
this out and sort of beta testing it for
us any problems that come up with the
aim for platform will be found before is
then launches and that's really cool if
you thought this was interesting and
have anything to comment about it let me
know in the comments down below or on
twitter at Linus tech also thanks to
Razer for sending us to pax OS 2016 this
year we're doing a huge giveaway with
them because we just passed three
million freaking subscribers we're
giving a new razor blade and a new razor
blade stealth to awesome super high
performance ultra books so click that
video description link down below
Ed's a Yago made custom art to be etched
into the laptops looks amazing
check it out stay subscribed Linus tech
tips to see all the rest of our paxos
2016 content and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
