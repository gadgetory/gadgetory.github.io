processor the machine in my hands is not
only more powerful than the impressively
compact msi trident that we reviewed
before it is less than half of the size
the msi vortex g25 is a totally
different kind of beast is it a desktop
is it a gaming laptop with the screen
ripped off and also no keyboard and
hopefully no noise or heating issues I
mean is anyone really expecting us to
answer these questions before we tell
you that today's video is brought to you
by Dunnell Bear tunnel bear makes it
easy to privately and securely browse a
more open Internet to try toddle bear
for free go to Tunnel bear comm /l tt
at a total internal volume of two and a
half liters and a weight of 2 and a half
kilograms the vortex g25 is a strikingly
slim machine it is so tiny that you
could easily hide it on the back of your
TV or monitor using the included vase
amount if you didn't want to see it
though honestly if you aren't totally
turned off by the gamer aesthetic it
actually looked pretty good both
horizontally in a TV console or
vertically on the included stand though
I would recommend fine-tuning the RGB
lighting a little bit for the latter to
keep things classy IO is curious it's
got two HDMI 2.0 ports that will handle
4k 60 Hertz so it's VR ready but there's
no freaking DisplayPort port I mean ok
yes there is a Thunderbolt 3 on the back
that can be used for that purpose but
would even a mini DP or an included
dongle have been too much to ask MSI out
of the box there was no way for Alex to
hook the g25 up to the older HDMI 1.4 4k
monitor on his desk while he was working
on this review that said the rest of the
i/o is pretty solid a good mix of USB
and networking and a couple of strong
indications that MSI thinks that one of
these would go great in your living room
a digital audio out and a 12-volt DC out
so that you can power a room scale VR
headset like the HTC vive without an
additional wall adapter nice inside this
thing is a monster
it features Intel's Core i7 8700 with 6
cores of up to 4.6 gigahertz turbo
Madness and a gtx 1070 GPU so i'm
expecting some phenomenal gaming
performance in our benchmarks if that is
msi can stop that hardware from getting
hotter than the seat of my pants after
evening of dining at Taco Bell gross and
good news I wouldn't quite call the g25
silent but from an arm's length away
it's hardly noticeable with a sound
quality that is easily forgotten and our
CPU leveled out in the mid 70s while
maintaining a respectable 4 gigahertz on
all six course and when it comes to
gaming our gtx 1070 ended up at a
comfortable nineteen hundred megahertz
at 70 degrees Celsius that is right up
there with a desktop card though it
should be noted that when the vortex is
placed horizontally you can expect your
temps to rise by about 10 degrees now we
didn't see any performance drop due to
that in our 24 degree office but this
could be a problem if you don't have air
conditioning now it should come as no
surprise that when you combine
impressive hardware with impressive
cooling you get impressive gaming
performance and the g25 hung right in
there with our standard desktop hardware
test bench and while it did actually
lose out to the ass rock desk many
another impressively small gaming system
it should be noted that that one costs a
lot more due to its more expensive GT X
1080 graphics card and it wasn't even
able to take full advantage of that card
due to its thermal throttling so let's
rip this thing open and have a look at
the secret sauce that MSI calls cooler
boost Titan it's a dumb name sure but I
can't argue with the results I mean look
at this eight heat pipes like huh MSI's
system team clearly took some
inspiration from the trident threes
notebook like cooling system and
improved on it before cramming it in
here it's just that instead of a regular
full-size PCIe 16x GPU we get a notebook
GPU on an MXM module so that is what
allows the vortex to be so slim but it
also brings along the
of making future upgrades of more
difficult or even impossible if nvidia
decides to stop supporting this form
factor while we were poking around
inside we noticed that our 16 gig ram
model had an empty slot making an
upgrade to 32 gigs easy nice then with
the back screws out the top also comes
off with a bit of love from a prying
tool to give us access to the other side
of the motherboard where you can upgrade
the two and a half inch drive add
another m2 or even no way there's two
more empty sodium slots for up to 64
gigs of ram I mean badass book sized
workstation anyone badass yes
cheap no as we learned from the ass rock
desk mini video
MXM cards cost significantly more than
their standard counterparts and this
hurts
the vortex g25 s value proposition the
good news is that compared to similar
small form-factor solutions it's not
that far off but the bad news is that
for the 1070 model with an i7 you're
looking at a cool two thousand dollars
bringing us back to the original
question is this a tiny high performance
desktop or is it a bulky laptop without
a screen and a keyboard well with this
kind of performance I'm inclined to go
with the former and it gets a solid
recommendation if you're willing to
spend the extra to save a little space
on your desk speaking of spending a
little extra Skillshare is an online
learning community with more than 17,000
classes InDesign photo editing and more
if you're looking for a way to pick up
some new skills so you can afford a
fancy vortex g25 Premium Membership
gives you unlimited access to
high-quality classes from experts
working in their fields and Skillshare
is also more affordable than most
learning platforms out there with an
annual subscription coming in at less
than $10 a month now since Skillshare is
sponsoring this video the first 200
people to use the promo link in the
we'll get there first two months for
free to try it out totally risk-free so
go check it out so thanks for watching
