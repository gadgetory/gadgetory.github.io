then you were get alright so this is
gonna be fun today now okay I lied a
little bit yeah yeah apparently I'm
still tuned into the stream from when
she last Friday and one of my many many
tabs okay so I lied a little bit this is
not a surprise in the sense that like we
didn't know that this computer was
coming we did know that digital storm
was sending us a machine but because
they actually sponsored this video they
got such a love hug from the last video
that we did where we were unboxing their
event to max which I know I still owe
you guys the review of but trust me it's
gonna be worth the wait we've got this
whole like cinematic intro planned where
I like roll up in a supercar or like a
rolls or something and then like my
Butler has my PC ready for me because
it's like a ten thousand dollar computer
anyway so they sponsored this video
because they wanted to demonstrate
something that I was actually surprised
to find out because a lot of people got
the impression on that other video the
digital storm only makes like mad
computers for lads who are mad and have
way too much money like more money than
sense they just they burn it for fun
just to like annoy their friends who are
poppers and they don't so this right
here is actually a brand new system from
them called the Lynx and it starts at
eight hundred US dollars now some
there's goes my chapstick wow that
really note for a rip they're going
around the corner there so uh I'm gonna
pretend to open this plastic see that
cuz Anthony actually already opened it
up so we could load some games on it and
stuff because I figured hey why don't we
find out what you can get from digital
storm for eight hundred bucks now
this is not secret shopper digital storm
ow well I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna have to
go report that to the Safety Committee
that's actually a thing even though you
know what I I don't think I do I can't
if I can't find it I'm pretty sure it's
not a thing so this isn't secret shopper
digital storm knew exactly who they were
sending this to so that means that you
know they could have potentially put a
little extra splash of cable management
here and there and all that kind of
stuff
but I'd actually love to hear from you
guys in the comments on this video if
you've ever bought a digital storm
machine do you think that your
experience was on par with what we're
unboxing today because that really tells
us the entire story now I think that's
pretty much everything that I had
prepped for myself other than the
product page so that I can have a look
at the different configurations that are
available but I can at least comment on
the shipping materials these are really
nice I love this type of foam this is
that super stiff but like also squishy
closed cell foam this is pretty much the
best thing that you can ship a system in
oh this one is so much less heavy than
the Aventa max I am absolutely thrilled
right now moving that thing around on my
own was not a good time let's go through
our accessory box here one of the things
about the boutique builders versus the
tier ones that I really like is that
while they don't give you the actual
retail boxes of the components that they
use they usually do at least give you
because a lot of the time like here so
we can already figure out that this
system has an R MX series power supply
from Corsair so there is no reason that
you wouldn't be able to take advantage
of Corsairs full I believe it's a is it
a three year or a five year warranty on
this particular series there's no reason
you wouldn't be able to take advantage
of that so having the packaging is
actually pretty nice because if you've
ever had to RMA just the power supply
then
you could potentially need that but at
least they do provide you with the
accessories and that's something that
you often don't get with like Tier one
systems as like oh I'm need to put in a
bunch of hard drives or if you start
with a pre-built system which a lot of
people do and then you go DIY in the
future
well maybe you find yourself in a
situation where you want to carry
forward the power supply from your
pre-built into like your new DIY rig
that's in a bigger case or whatever and
you want to put eight or twelve hard
drives in it it's nice to have all those
modular cables that would have
originally come with your power supply
in the future what else we got here so
we've got their RGB controller this is
something something plus fan controller
is this fans only one way to find out
got some cable ties those also came with
the power supply we've got a nice little
recovery USB that's a nice thing to
include not because I would necessarily
use a recovery USB but because I can
just have a free USB Drive I treat them
this like sort of disposable these days
not disposable in that I throw them away
disposable in that I often lose them so
it's nice to just have a supply of them
lying around we apparently got an MSI
graphics card and blah blah blah blah ok
this is adorable
lucky the dragon computer workshop
they're really going all in on this
dragon first make sure you have
installed in video geforce experience oh
lucky we don't need GeForce experience
it's highly optional alright let's take
a look at the machine
interesting not too many guys do like a
double layer of wrapping material
usually they do either that kind of
cloth II feeling paper or they do a
plastic cover again I'd like to know in
the comments if they like double wrap
everything so they're still doing
customized chassis even on their lower
end stuff that's actually pretty nice to
see although I believe this is hey
Anthony do you recognize the the bear
the bass case here I actually don't
either
fun fact a lot of the time so I looked
into this back when I was working at
NCIX a lot of the time what you'll see
is that a customized case only has a
couple of pieces that are customized you
can actually save a lot of money it
costs anywhere from half a million to a
million dollars to do the full tooling
including like plastic molding and all
that kind of crazy stuff for a
completely ground-up chassis whereas if
you go to you know someone like a comp
you case that's just an example I don't
think that digital storm was probably
using comp you case here but if you go
to someone like a comp you case and you
go oh yeah like these metal internals
look good I just want a custom bezel
then that's a lot easier to do and it's
a lot cheaper so that's what you'll see
a lot of the time is on a customized
chassis from someone like a system
integrator where they don't have the
kind of volume of sales that someone
who's dedicated to selling cases has
you'll see them customized just a couple
of small pieces so that they can still
get like they're nice branding on there
this is probably RGB I would guess but
they don't have to necessarily spend a
million dollars tempered-glass side
panel it's nice to see I'm so glad that
this has made its way down into I
wouldn't necessarily call you know eight
hundred dollars like mainstream like
it's not a you know $2.99 special at
Best Buy or whatever
but it's down into sort of what I would
consider to be the entry level for
decent gaming systems because acrylic
panels look great in pictures and they
look great out of the box but whoopsie
daisies but beyond that they get all
scratched up they attract fingerprints
and dust they attract hair like that
honestly that's the biggest problem that
I have with acrylic side panels because
if you could just keep them completely
clear you wouldn't have an issue but you
can't because they end up like
statically charged so just any dust or
hair floating around in the room just
get sucked on to them it's horrible all
right let's critique their cable
management here and I'm not going easy
on them just because this is a sponsored
video there's a couple of things so
there's a few things that are good
everything in here is nice and tight
it's routed out of the way I have a
feeling I actually haven't looked at it
from the other side yet but I have a
feeling it's gonna look pretty darn good
they've done a good job of utilizing
these these hold downs here to keep
things from kind of drifting out in
front of these holes so you're not going
to be able to see them through the gaps
from the other side one thing that can
be a concern actually we ran into this
again this is from back from my NCIX PC
building experience is if you strap
everything down too tight you can run
into cables coming out during shipping
now one thing did get a little jostled
during shipping here and that's this
empty hard drive cage but I'm not gonna
take any marks off for that because the
way that these are designed to stay in
is when the drive is inserted in them
they wouldn't be able to flex in like
this but when it's not it's easy for it
to kind of come loose and just any any
bump from the courier could easily have
made that happen but anyway so back to
back to things being overly tightened
what we'd run into is like you know one
of our tax would go and put you know one
two three four five six you know seven
cable ties onto something like this and
it would end up being so tight that it
would like pull the power connector out
of the hard drive next to it or
something like that and it doesn't
appear as though they've put any strain
here they've also left a courtesy
connector for both SATA power and SATA
this is a really nice thing to see
because if you it's one of the most
common upgrades is just adding a little
bit more storage to your system so it's
nice to make that easy a one thing I'm
not a fan of is this digital storm
that's one thing I think you guys could
do a little bit better in your efforts
to make everything nice and tightly
bound you have kinked actually what
appears to be the front audio USB 3 and
USB 3 can be quite a sensitive cable
especially USB 3.1 now these are 3.0
realistically this is probably fine I'm
going to plug something into it but
that's not something that I would have
personally done um everything else here
actually looks like really clean looking
really good
all right I'm 750 X that's not bad I
actually don't know exactly what
configuration all the links we have so
we're gonna find that out once we go
ahead and fire it up so this is one
other a relatively affordable
customization that you can do on an
off-the-shelf case I wonder if someone
in the youtube comments has actually
told me already
which chassis this is based off of we
don't - we actually don't do any case
reviews around here anymore so I'll like
run into a case and I'm like oh yeah
this is this is cool and it's like yeah
it's been up for like a year
ok I know alright that's clean that's
clean that's looking good again ok so
I'm I'm gonna check I'm gonna check I'm
gonna check the comments on the stream
now because I have a hard time believing
that they put this many cable ties in
every one of their systems they've got a
couple here keeping the extra 2 pin in
place as well as the extra loop from the
8 pin to the 6 pin or the sorry the 6 +
2 pin I personally do like this approach
especially if you get it nice and tight
like this otherwise you end up with kind
of this weird loop and there's a lot of
different ways that people cable
management manage them I do like this
approach they've got another one here
they've got one here grabbing the power
and it looks like the that might be an
RGB connector for the the pump
block combo unit here they've got
another one going back there yep more
cable ties on the fan over here so this
is plugged in here but then it's cable
tied here and here in order to keep the
wire back here now I have to confess
that was something that I always used to
cheap out on on my builds my technique
for plugging in the rear fan was to take
the cable and like twist it up so that
it would kind of curl around on itself
and then I would take the whole thing
and just jam it in there
usually wouldn't come out but this is
actually a more a more professional way
to do this now this is weird I assumed
we had an MSI graphics card but we don't
in fact we don't have an MSI anything
what hold on just a minute here lucky
the dragon MSI graphics card quick users
guide msi geforce drivers and utilities
digital storm did you send me these cute
stickers just to suck up
they must have they must have gotten the
accessory package mixed up because this
is an asus graphics card i'm actually
not a hundred percent sure what the
model is oh looks like it's an RT x 27 t
and this is also a nice motherboard this
is a z3 9 DP prime or a prime z3 9 DP
this is actually a pretty high-end
config overall so we've got a 2 terabyte
hard drive 500 gigs of 970 Evo nvme
storage I don't know what processor
we're looking at but this is probably 16
yep this is 16 gigs of DDR 4 memory at
3200 megahertz and let's go ahead and
fire it up so maybe I can figure out
exactly what let's have a look at the
super chad's here
oh this is awesome is this from today
oh no it's from the last web show
someone sent a super chat congratulating
Luke on his doctor disrespect joke
that's so good
it was so funny alright sorry David
there's nothing really that fascinating
to look at back here just standard power
cord this is where we judge their
ability to make sure that things work
right out of the box although again
Anthony did fire it up so you could
throw some games on it I do want to find
out how much this config costs now that
I know exactly which one I have I'll
need to know what processor it is first
though uh no I don't want any of the
surprises foot okay my chapstick fell
out again how did that happen
I'm probably gonna want what now
oh yes Ethernet cable Thank You Anthony
are you hanging around just to help me
alright power on
Wow that is RGB AF I guess I shouldn't
be that surprised I don't know I just
like with the event 'im I fully expected
it because it's like at the ten thousand
dollar system then you kind of you reach
a point where you can't really spend
more money on the hardware and you just
have to start spending more money on
flash rather than - but this is this is
pretty pretty RGB doubt as well let's go
ahead and have a look at what they've
what they've managed to implement here
here come on over here so first we've
got three of digital storms RGB fans in
the front so those are taking care of
the illumination of this logo here it
doesn't actually seem as though it's
independently what oh no it is - so
that's awesome so the logo itself has
its own RGB lighting and then there's
three RGB fans behind it that are just
glowing through the perforations in the
front of the case all right we've got to
make sure that in the event of an RGB
fan failure or an RGB light dimming you
know your logo is always taken care of
then we've got a couple of what appeared
to be individually addressable RGB
strips we've got one along the top and
then we've got one along the front can
you see that all right David yeah the
top ones really hiding up there like
it's the kind of thing that you'd
probably only really see in the dark
we've got one small RGB lighting element
on our graphics card we've got RGB on
the CPU cooler we've got RGB on the logo
down here and we've got RGB on the back
if we rated our gaming systems you know
out of how many RG B's they have this
would be a one two three four five six
seven eight this would be nine out of
ten now we do have one small potential
snag that we hit and that's that I am
not getting an output right now this is
always fun this is why I love doing
things live instead of pretty Oh what
what even just happened to dumped us all
the way at the desktop okay hold on a
second I wanted to see if they tuned
anything in the BIOS dang it we're
getting some requests in the YouTube
chat for some ASMR is that like a very
current meme right now because wasn't
there some weird commercial with a ton
of ASMR in it or something you know what
I don't think this monitor review is up
on YouTube yet you guys are gonna want
to check this out this is a or s is
active noise-cancelling monitor and we
brought it in for review thinking well
that's going to be super stupid alright
something we can basically
make fun of and have nobody really
defend it and it actually ended up
working quite a lot better than we
expected but then not in the ways that
we expected the active noise-cancelling
is man I don't know that that many
people will use it but there are other
aspects of it that are really good how's
the glare off the screen that's fine
cool so we've got a 9700 K 16 gigs of
RAM as we knew I'm gonna go ahead and
I'm going to just do mic my sort of
quick change load optimise defaults yes
and then f10 and changed oh so it looks
like they have actually done some tuning
in here so they set the AI overclocked
tuner to XMP too they set the AVX
instruction and core ratio negative
offset from 1 to auto interesting so hey
Anthony can you think of a reason they
would change the AVX instruction core
ratio negative offset from 1 to auto
does AC ship it at one no no I changed
it to auto I set optimized defaults so
they said oh they set it to one Oh
interesting so it's Auto more than one
it's on a 9700 K Oh they've changed more
than I thought here whoa okay so we've
got there overclocking service running
on here alright so they changed the RAM
frequency to thirty-two hundred
megahertz they've set it to sync all
cores which might actually be all
they've done in terms of overclocking
because it doesn't look like they've
adjusted the CPU multiplier so all
they've done is tune the DRAM voltage
the timings the frequency they've set it
to all core turbo and then they've set
the cue fan control the PWM elbe that's
good so that means that we're using a
PWM either fan or pump depending
whatever they've plugged into it they've
set CPU fan speed to ignore that's an
interesting one I wonder if they're
customized a Sutekh cooler here doesn't
have an RPM sand
yes it does it's right here ha that's a
weird thing yeah you could be right
because you can actually I think you can
adjust the threshold in a Seuss's bios
but it might be that you can't adjust it
low enough it's a power phase control
extreme power duty control load line
calibration level 3 ok so basically they
haven't really overclocked it in the
sense that they have adjusted the CPU
multiplier they have just set it to take
all of the cores to the multiplier of
the max turbo that it otherwise would
have been able to achieve except under
demanding AVX loads they've set an
offset of 1 so you would run 100
megahertz lower in a really really heavy
workload so we're gonna discard our
changes and exit so we can actually keep
the tuning that they've done on here
I'll be interested to see if it's stable
because a lot of the reason we dabbled
very little in overclocking back in the
NCIX days is that you can't really count
on it and I've seen a lot of people
complain about pre overclocked systems
saying that you know that's stupid I
don't want to pay $100 for someone to
press a couple dials because
theoretically now you could order the
same system just go through that list of
everything I showed in boom you've
applied the digital storm pre overclock
but it's not necessarily quite that
simple because what we would run into
back from we were building these systems
is you'd have Hardware be it the CPU the
course themselves the memory controller
the motherboard whatever it is you'd run
into hardware that can't handle the
overclock that you validated with you
know the engineering sample chips that
Intel sent over while you were designing
your new lineup or whatever else and
then all of a sudden you've got like
these CPUs that you can't sell in
overclocked systems unless you go and
spend a bunch more time like figuring
out what exactly you need to tune about
this one
so there can be some there can be some
overhead in terms of making sure that
whatever you're shipping out actually
runs at those speeds so you can see here
even though we're barely doing anything
we're basically sitting at the desktop
this puppy's running at 4
point six six four point six seven
gigahertz not too shabby
I am logged into another computer
playing 3dmark
mm-hm Bob why it's probably Alex does
someone want to send him a quick message
and let him know that not to kick me
back off that would be swell if you
could not do that why don't we have a
look at some of our super chats here
it's an MB 500 apparently the case okay
finally caught a live stream says keys
thanks for all the fun videos you are
totally welcome oh that's weird
I think I need to reload this page it
doesn't say it doesn't say how many
people are watching maybe nobody's
watching it's entirely possible I don't
think Jake would tell me I think he
would actually just let me sit here
there's 20,000 people watching my things
not working oh all right cool all right
really actually quite like this monitor
so it's 144 Hertz its 1440p it's got
some kind of interesting features here
I'm not sure how much digital storm is
gonna like this but you know what can i
what can I say it might just be too bad
let me just see if I can find here we go
I'm just gonna put on a crosshair here
David if you want to come maybe we can
let the chat decide which crosshair I
should put into my built-in crosshair
monitor thing so we got style 1 it's a
pretty standard crosshair what do you
think what do you think David you like
this one no boring okay
maybe well I'll let David decide Allah
David decided ok custom too so we drew
we drew our own crosshair what do you
think it's disgusting it's gross you
don't like it
okay custom - you're in you're in what
custom 3 ok so so really it's between
custom 2 and custom 3 then it's alright
custom 3 alright I want I want
floatplane
floatplane to decide I'm just gonna fire
up the fire up the floatplane chat here
oh did you change the title on
floatplane Jake oh okay it's probably
just because I need to reload reload oh
shoot
it went away okay so game assist okay
custom to or custom three no mine
I the chat yeah it's not showing there
we go whoa whoa the overwhelming
overwhelming majority they want they
want the two the people the people have
told us oh floatplane doesn't have any
spam mitigation a lot of these are the
same people you guys alright alright
alright alright alright we're going with
200 and it's pink by the way alright so
where do I want to keep these settings
absolutely I do
let's do it so I actually don't know
exactly what configuration of the system
this is and how much this one costs why
don't we find that out in a little bit
but first let's wait oh no I wanted to
go in arcade mode well that's okay at
least I have this wonderful crosshair to
stare at okay I know this is sponsored
by digital storm but I have to take this
opportunity to say you gotta respect
companies that know their audience that
right there and I'm not pointing to the
person I'm just pointing to his neck
that is a neckbeard you know cuz you got
to be you got to be a little bit you got
to be a little bit realistic you know
like I don't think you can okay
generalizations are bad and they hurt us
all but I think it's fair to say that
the people who are like really into the
look of their computer fall into
different general demographics than the
people who are just into sort of like
playing games and you know what I
personally like it's like a campaign for
real beauty kind of thing to me just
going you know what the people who are
gaming
our systems you know some of them might
actually look like gamers like I'm sure
digital storm employees like you know
you know really gorgeous models for some
of their marketing collateral or
whatever else but I also think it's cool
that they just have like people who just
look like you and me and Anthony and
Jake just like gaming on the system and
I like I respect that
that's good that's probably a digital
storm employee to be perfectly honest
with you what's a good doom arcade mode
run where you can just like run around
and kill stuff okay too late you're out
see Anthony shoot I think we're no no no
man there we go
start round I'm just gonna double check
make sure we're at 144 Hertz here come
on video d bloody resolution off looks
right apparently you can't set that I
don't know it's just weird it's this FPS
is showing 60 for some reason I just
want to make sure that what's up I have
wait oh I recognized the Hat more than
well okay in my defense he's like in
profile what's his name again
shoot yeah no yeah alright that's he's
the booth babe okay uh no actually this
does look fine so I'm not too worried
shut up Jake I am so bad with names and
faces this is like so embarrassing right
now this is the problem with doing
things live this you know what I'm not
doing videos live anymore
this is officially our last live stream
ever last live stream
nope no and show anymore when shows dead
I mean let's face it when show was dead
to a lot of our viewers already anyway
oh man that's so bad Jake do you mind
doing me a favor and finding out how
much this configures so we're at 2560 by
1440 g-sync on actually no this is a
free sinc monitor so ooh interesting I
haven't actually tried it on this
monitor yet but we should be able to
enable g-sync oh no it's not showing up
in here that's interesting I wonder if
we actually don't have the the latest
driver that driver only dropped like a
week or so ago mmm that's kind of a
bummer we're on for 17.7 teen so we're
running at anywhere from actually David
you wanted to come check out our frame
right here Jake are you working on that
the website so did we love hug the
website again man so anyway we're
running it anywhere from around 170 to
200 FPS this is 2560 by 1440 it's a 9700
K it's got an r/t X 27 T so this isn't
like a like a crazy over the top or
anything this is to grand us all right
500 gig and viennese storage so it's 970
honestly I loved Samsung's Evo lineup of
SSDs because you look at sort of
synthetic benchmarks like if you go and
you throw like data center workloads out
them or whatever there's definitely a
difference between the Evo's and the
pros but in terms of actual desktop use
and what's realistic for a typical gamer
or even like a media professional just
as a boot drive it's the performance is
just fantastic and the price is so much
lower than the pro ones so 2 grand
so you're basically paying about 10
bucks per FPS in doom at 1440p and then
what details are we running out here
we've got FXAA on and we're running oh
this looks like our hold on that was on
high
so I'm gonna let's go ahead and see how
she handles ultra there's just a couple
things I want to adjust here motion blur
yeah
yes I want to keep these advanced
settings I hate how hard it is to just
adjust settings and games these days
it's a pain in the butt yeah motion blur
off that's good
vsync off all right so 1440p ultra let's
try again and she couldn't even tell the
difference well isn't that just
fantastic you want to come check that
out we are still getting 200 frames per
second on this puppy love it something
else is do you want to let me know if
anyone like wants to see anything in
particular in chat you don't know if you
want to let me know I could do that but
I'm kind of playing video games right
now I'm sort of on lunch no I don't want
to do Mucho today I brought a lunch my
my in-laws made curry and it is
fantastic it is like the greatest like I
don't even know what kind of curry it is
it's some kind of like Asian style curry
that is the most amazing thing ever I
don't think we have that loaded
we have minecraft
we're not playing Minecraft look at
these headshots look at these headshots
Oh
headshot oh I messed 16 gig download you
know what all right do we even have
origin on here we do we do all right all
right you know what I'm here for nothing
if not to entertain the people so I have
never played apex legends it's a shooter
right okay basically point-and-click
adventure game then no problem I'm sure
I can figure this out
add to library download with origin yes
all right people let's do this yeah I'm
pretty sure this isn't a ten hundred
port let's just double-check that before
we're fully committed here that data yes
we are gigging it's all over the desktop
and everything it's beautiful it's
beautiful I have read and agree to this
and this will be playable at 39% how's
this coming down wow this is coming down
real nice oh this is it definitely
cached because we're oh oh look how
beautiful that is we are downloading a
game from origin at 950 megabit per
second and that's not entirely just
because of our caching server because
you can actually see what happens to our
CPU this is an unexpected benefit of
having a super fast CPU like on a per
core basis so this overclocked 9700 K
means that with 30% utilization on this
thing because there's only so many
threads that you can make use of when
you are when you're unpacking a game
that you're downloading we can basically
saturate our gigabit network connection
off of our Steam cache server so when
Jake set it up what did you set it up to
cache off I'm gonna walk over here so
they can actually hear you steam origin
I thought you did like windows update
and stuff do windows update yeah okay
why do I even ask you if I'm gonna be
the one telling the people what all
right thank you thank you thank you you
don't get any points for ego stroking
though what's also good yeah it's not
that much for the SSD though that's only
like 100 megabytes a second and there
might be a random element to it yeah
like if it's unpacking it as it goes man
that's fantastic so we actually did
discover when we did our steam cache
video that we were highly
single-threaded CPU performance
bottlenecks on many
there were only a handful of them call
of duty black ops 2 black ops 1 was one
that we could get like 300 plus
megabytes a second of download just
because it's not that compressed so now
we're we're back at it again with the
900 plus ok are other people less
impressed by this than I am because I I
can move on like I can move on I'm just
so happy so we're already at 70 percent
on this thing let's go ahead and play do
we do we own this game it's free oh
right because gullible people buy skins
that's basically the model right well
what I what do you what do you want from
me I mean what should we blow it on
skins I don't think I can do it you know
what I I have to say I have never paid
for an in-game item that's not like
actual like quest material so Dragon Age
Origins I I bought like some more quests
or something like yeah I've paid for
well no to me that's an expansion pack
basically and it might be a micro
expansion pack or whatever the case may
be but in terms of like a cosmetic item
or like the privilege of playing a
particular character I am proud to have
never paid for that what's the super
chat avila Avalon says want to see some
alien where area 51 m and rog mothership
full reviews can't decide which one to
go with who okay so i can comment a
little bit on it we will have full
reviews coming but we don't have our
review units yet of either but i had
been hands on with them so rog
mothership is a great option if you
realistically think you are going to
it on a desk any time you use it if
there's ever gonna be like a desperation
situation where you might need to like
sit with it on your lap on like a a bus
or something then the the del I forget
what the model is 51m sorry the
Alienware 51m might work out better for
you but there's gonna be so many factors
in that like we're gonna have to when
you're separating like two companies
completely different takes on best of
the best or whatever it's really tough
because they're both gonna go all out
and then in certain ways and they make
compromises and others there's nothing
you can really do about it no I lied I
did I got swept up in the star citizen
hype all right Thank You Nick yes I was
nope okay gullible people so I mean okay
I haven't done it since then I learned
from my mistake no I bought a
constellation like I have that like
Ballwin like multi person crude ship
yeah it's probably worth absolutely
nothing now I've flown it once oh yeah
that's that's a real wolf that's a real
shame alright let's just open this game
yeah yeah I got I got ripped I got
ripped full rip I can skip this hold
space to skip cool hey at least they got
that right attempting connection
retrieving match making list
alright so someone someone filming in
I'm not up on my apex legends what's
this stick here hub G crossed with
overwatch so so there's like classes
then pub G but classes are Katie okay
alright alright
thanks for playing our game and joining
us in on this new journey oh you're very
welcome to you must play apex right how
long is the training
five minutes all right let's do it Kings
Canyon you know we should have set up
the stream so that people could actually
like see the game and stuff okay so
that's a slow punch oh oh I would
probably Audio would be nice okay so it
just wants me to move crouch and then
slide okay cool so I did those things
completely okay it seems pretty easy
okay
now what I'm I'm certain there's audio
right now go loot go leader look bloody
hell yeah okay open the thing I'm gonna
take all the stuff and I don't know what
any of it is I'm gonna throw it left
click to throw a grenade okay so I'm
gonna swap it I'm gonna try and blow up
this guy you know I'm gonna go oh I was
gonna go hurt myself so that when I use
the health kit there I'll actually be a
point to it and then I'm gonna hold G to
use the Ordnance menu arc star thermite
grenade frag grenade I'm sure click oh
now I open it up man games are so
complicated I missed the days of like
quake you just grab all the things and
then just throw them at other people
this guy's probably saying something
Jake do you remember the tutorial where
do I go I'm gonna shoot those things all
right cool and a one and A two and A one
two three
sorry what's I need a second weapon well
it looks like there's some stuff over
here well no I want this stuff I want mo
missions ammunitions I'm full okay pick
up the second weapon alright alright I'm
working on it I'm working up into the
left what this big monster what are you

what do i what do I know about whatever
not want an SMG there you like that yeah
I don't want to okay
hold you to replace the weapon with
another all right there's a handgun
there like that
Derrick tutorial what is this an
automatic handgun no it's stupid
you guys are hard to watch you want to
know why cuz you're not live on YouTube
right now so how am I supposed to watch
you okay i pinged a location i pinged an
enemy location i pinged a weapon where's
a weapon oh I know I gotta get around to
the other side of this again ping a
weapon alright paying some a low paying
all the things hold to use the ping menu
blah blah watching here alright cool
good for me oh man are we close yet two
more parts holster weapons to run faster
I should be able to pull it a knife
everyone runs faster with the knife
talked to Pathfinder who the hell is
Pathfinder how do I get up there or
there stairs
I need stairs I don't want to jump up
there climb alright let's climb that
climb the rocks all good right over
there and slide or something I know I
don't know what you're saying
my ultimate my abilities yeah we all
know that's not happening unless my
ultimate is like punch really hard and
really slowly I do like that though
there's so many all I have to use it
okay how do you ultimate oh okay cool I
don't know maybe it's possible use your
tactical ability okay what did I do
I don't know I could be just as soon as
I was terrible at the game oh wow ouch
that's that hurts that hurts that hurts
me we have a new membership perk for
YouTube oh yeah community posts so we
have to do community posts and then
people who are members will see them
know oh right I think we were gonna do
coupon codes for the merch store no okay
I don't remember then my the microphone
is on my chest so you're gonna have to
come a little closer it's very slow and
inefficient to do it that way once a
month we're going to do a Members Only
community post which is a pole for which
livestream we should do on a Friday oh
so they get to pick the programming okay
cool I'm gonna use my I'm gonna use my
ultimate ability here Z call in a care
package boop boop oh I can't I can't
like drop it on him Jake had enough of
your crap okay where is it okay if I
stand under it will I die in the real
game that would kill me
okay well let's find out if it kills you
in the tutorial I moves me totally move
me out of the way all right so I get
that hey hey I'm doing the tutorial here
okay did I pass yet I got this are we
good nice what is this countdown for
sure that's fine whatever the guns can't
they can't be that hard
I mean if it's like CAUTI then it should
be fine yes yes I'm a winner
Oh I have no idea how the games running
I mean origin has an FPS counter
built-in I actually did not know that
origin
what like settings application settings
Diagnostics origin in in-game logging
yeah I don't know what this is talking
about it's like clearly running higher
than that so it's fine I'm not worried
about it
notifications yeah do you have any idea
how to uh how to show fps
okay well we'll turn that off in the
game oh come on back maybe you can do it
you can do it come on settings okay
video triple buffer no wonder it looks
so smooth and he aliasing tsaa
texture filtering the blah blah blah hi
hi hi everything hi is there hire nope
no hire there is
gameplay obituaries convert damaged
numbers shift f1 it's probably gonna
it's probably gonna close the game or
something you you guys are all such
trolls all of you I did I did yeah that
makes sense

worry about it there let's just play the
game

that's not my team okay so freedom is
the jumpmaster cool so anytime okay so
where are we going now okay and landing

someone hi are you here still but I saw
you there you are what are you doing
I don't understand this you have a
shield you for finisher nice cool I was
easy
point click yeah I told you I was gonna
kill someone I don't know this seems
like a lot of work yeah okay okay I
don't know I just I deployed a thing do
you know what look this is embarrassing
for that person not me
I'm drawing too much attention to myself
right now I'm just gonna I'm gonna wait
here this seems like a good place to
wait this isn't that hard no problem
that guy did kind of suck though yeah
shut up David don't be a kiss-ass that
was it
hey I still consider it a success I
killed one person
so speaking of success I think that's
pretty much gonna be the end of our
stream that's about as that's about as
well as that could have possibly gone
guys you're gonna want to check out the
digital storm links they sponsored this
epic demonstration of fail gaming with
their RGB powered actually very powerful
gaming machine here it's got a three
year warranty I think there were a
couple of other things I was supposed to
mention about it it's available with
overclocking which even if you're
completely GPU bound in every game you
play if you were to set up a steam
caching server could result in faster
downloads off of your steam caching
server look I'm so excited about that
it's so cool I love it when the system
works because there's there's no real
load on the server itself it's just
serving up files so it's the clients so
if you had like a 10 gigabit team
caching server and then you had lots of
really fast clients they could pull down
games like nobody's business anyway
so thanks for watching guys if you
dislike this video you can hit that
button if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description
also down there is our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join Alex totally called when I was
gonna be ready for script review she was
like one and I was like twelve thirty
twelve forty and it's like quarter after
one yeah I was playing video games I was
doing very important things wow I
actually did less damage than one of the
other people on my team but I survived
for far longer
I killed someone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
