2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is Corsair
Vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCI XCOM guys it's still Computex
2013 for some reason I guess it's
because it's not over yet and we are
here in the asrock booth where I am
holding a motherboard that looks pretty
much like any other motherboard except
for the very outrageous color scheme as
well as some you know water cooling
Barb's here on the vrm cooling solution
and all that kind of cool stuff you got
four PCI Express 16x graphics cards
oh wait what's that hold on a minute
come over here I can have a closer look
what is this alright now I have long
said that every motherboard needs to
have a matte black PCB I now officially
have to take that back because the
glossy black PCB on the ass rock OC
formula z87 board enables it to actually
be waterproof they have a live demo here
with this system running this video demo
right here of the board receiving its
conformal coating so you check that out
and they have that demo running on a
computer that has water running over it
this is absolutely freaking unbelievable
and what you might think to yourself is
well why do I need a liquid proof
motherboard I can think of a couple
reason number one is extreme
overclocking so this board actually
comes with a little a little nick sheet
right there little Nick she's signature
so he is a very famous overclocker he's
got his designed by badge on this board
when you are extreme overclocking it is
incredibly important to avoid
condensation condensation can destroy
your motherboard
if you're not using as the 87 OC formula
because wetness can become conductive
very very quickly boom zap it's dead so
for extreme overclocking where
condensations an issue then this is very
beneficial now I can even think of
applications that this might be awesome
that aren't extreme overclocking such as
liquid cooling if you're worried about
Oh a pipe burst somewhere and you get
some water on your board don't worry
about it with this board you can
actually I mean I don't I still don't
really recommend it
you know firing it right up because the
water might have gotten on
thing else but you won't have to worry
about your motherboard at all it's got a
bunch of other cool features including
check this out a status o LED display
gone are the days evidently of just like
two little sort of you know single-digit
things next to each other now you can
monitor things like temperature as well
as base clock and all that kind of cool
stuff right on the motherboard itself
you've also got onboard switches dual
BIOS dual USB 3 ports over there at the
front onboard overclocking switches as
well as voltage check points right there
at the back behind the 24 pin connector
and check this out this is a feature
that's going to be very beneficial for
guys like gamers guys who have a
secondary gaming system that they want
to hook up to their monitor so for a
long time companies like BenQ have been
releasing monitors that have multiple
inputs such as DVI and HDMI or dual HDMI
so you can easily run both your computer
and your game console through your
monitor but what as rocks done is
they've added an HDMI pass-through that
allows you to use your computer to
switch what is displayed on your monitor
making it a more seamless experience
than reaching around to the back ear
computer and unplugging or plugging
something in or even reaching up to your
monitor to change the source input so if
running water over a motherboard while
its operating wasn't ridiculous enough
for you this right here is the z87
extreme 11 AC it has wireless AC it's
got overclocking features it supports up
to 4-way crossfire so you can see that
running right there and it actually gets
more ludicrous than that so check out
this this is an SSD array a massive
number of SSDs 22 SSDs count them four
wide by five deep and then an extra two
that are sitting back there at the back
and I have something to share with you
guys these are all connected to the z87
extreme 11 AC right over here so this is
using the six SATA three six gigabit per
second connectors that are provided by
Intel's chipset you actually can't
really see them all unless you get right
in there at that angle so there are six
coming straight out of the board and
there are another 16 sas3
connectors running off of an LSI sas3
chip
that is built into this motherboard if
you have a serious need for storage
don't think that you're limited to just
SSDs if you want to run 22 SATA 3 or 6
SATA 3 with 16 SAS 3 devices off of your
board at the same time for whatever
reason this is the only board that is
even remotely capable of doing that but
if you don't feel like building your own
computer and pouring water all over it
then check out the m8 series right here
this is a new thing from asrock it's a
DIY bare-bones unit that is going to
allow you to get that same ridiculously
ludicrously fast gaming experience that
we've seen with some sort of you know
some boutique builders doing with
something like the ibuypower revolt for
example except that it's something that
you can acquire yourself and you have
the flexibility of choosing your own
components and building it yourself as
well now you might have noticed that
this is not exactly your standard
run-of-the-mill
bare-bones unit it uses an aluminum
chassis that was actually designed by
BMWs design group much like the level
10m mouse that's right here and the
level 10m headset that are sitting right
next to it so wouldn't these make a
stunning combination the construction as
I said before is aluminum and
ventilation is handled by 260 millimeter
fans up here in the top is quite rugged
feeling as well I can actually pick the
thing up by one of the handles and I
don't have to worry too much about it
breaking making it extremely portable
and they've added some unique features
as well so here on the front you've got
USB 3 SuperSpeed and a slot load optical
drive as well as this is kind of neat
check this out so you can monitor things
like your CPU clock speed as well as
your time and then you can interface
with it with a simple push button
interface as well as a rotating rubber
knob with an LED backlight now let's go
ahead and see how the magic works inside
so I'm going to turn it around the wrong
way first as if I don't know how this
works check this out magnets which are
basically magic as far as I can tell so
there's a window on the back how do you
get away with putting a window on the
back of the computer case well I'll tell
you how by having extremely clean cable
management so the case comes cable
managed for you pretty much you don't
have to worry about that and you can
actually see the reinforcement that's on
the motherboard tray here I mean it's
one of Steve Jobs as design philosophies
that
a great device should look great not
only on the outside but also on the
inside so having clean cable management
really does show that attention to
detail that not all things achieve the
side window also has kind of a unique
octagon based concentric octagons design
that you either like or you'll dislike
personally I really like it moving on to
the inside we see very short cable runs
which again is a desirable feature and
we also see check this out that is a
full size graphics card you could fairly
easily run pretty much any graphics card
you wanted in here with the exception of
sort of ludicrous stuff like our Radeon
7990 but you could easily get a GTX 780
in here
it uses an SFX power supply but don't
worry that won't matter to you because
it comes with that it also uses an ITX
motherboard that has onboard Wi-Fi as
well as support for up to to 8 gig dims
of ddr3 and support for pretty much any
Intel CPU you'd want as long as it's has
well so that's an LGA 1150 socket so
you're going to want to put the latest
46 70 K or 4770k CPU into the unit so I
can never remember this so I'm going to
get my lovely assistant to come and tell
me this what do you actually have to add
to this system in order to make it
functional ok users who buy this m8
series motherboard can have the freedom
of choosing their own CPU and graphics
card or if they need more stars then
they can add more storage into the
motherboard so three things three things
so why couldn't I remember that maybe
because it's appearances is too stunning
yeah I'm certainly stunned right now so
