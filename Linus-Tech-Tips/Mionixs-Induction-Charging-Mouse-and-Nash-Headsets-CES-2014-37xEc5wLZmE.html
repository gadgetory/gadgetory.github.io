brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital I was excited to come to
the me onyx suite because I use their
mice quite often I like how big it is
and it fits quite nicely in my hand
not very many mice do and when I came
here I was hoping they'd have another
Mouse because I do really like their
mice what was here was not what I
expected they have a wireless inducting
charging Mouse which is actually really
interesting the cable goes to the mouse
pad not the mouse which is actually
pretty cool
Wireless mice are cool because there's
no cable tag if you ever try and pull it
away it's not going to get stuck on
anything but then they're not cool
because they die while you're playing so
this is a really nice happy medium of
the in-between because you won't have
your cable tugging on anything but then
you also don't have to dock it or charge
or change out batteries or die in the
middle of a game because you can't aim
anymore which is incredibly frustrating
what they did for the body of this mouse
is they flared it out a little bit on
the sides pinkies no longer drag your
thumb no longer drags and it's actually
just a greater overall experience in my
opinion I do really like the form factor
although that is up for you to decide
the Munich's nash 20s are a whole nother
beast they're quite large which I like a
lot because they actually fit me
properly
and they're really really comfortable
with memory foam ear cups and a memory
foam top there mic is pretty cool
because you there's a very easily
audible noticeable click as you boom it
down which will mute it if you put it up
which is very nice it has a braided
cable and gold-plated tips on their
connectors which will help you plug it
in but it doesn't do a ton else other
than that again extremely comfortable
headset it has dact custom drivers which
are pretty awesome and that's about all
I can say about the audio right now I'm
sure we'll get a better review from
Linus once we actually get these back in
the office it's hard to test them while
we're on the road because you can't
really compare them against other
headsets and we don't have our source
audio proper and all that kind of stuff
so I'm sure we'll get something from
Linus later on on the other side of the
room we have something that looks
similar but isn't this is the Nash 71
it's not going to be up for a really
long time so get your hopes up but not
too much because you might have to wait
a little while it has a detachable USB
cable and environmental noise cancelling
mic so that's on the outside of them it
takes environmental noise outside so
your mic doesn't get too much random
fuzz in it and it is Dolby 7.1 unlike
the analogue headset the Nash 20 that we
just tucked out thank you for watching
