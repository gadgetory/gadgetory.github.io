traditional outdoor unboxing location of
the NFF 12 pwm from Noctua now this is a
pressure centric fan and this goes with
not to as long-standing proud tradition
of delivering excellent performance at a
quiet noise level however not every fan
is suitable for every purpose so now
they had before ok before they had the
s12 and they had the p12 the s12 was for
open airflow environments like a case
exhaust fan and the p12 was for more
restrictive environments such as a heat
sink or a radiator now the f12 arts yes
sorry the f12 doesn't replace either
those fans but it is even better at
pushing air through more densely
populated areas that is to say more
dense heat sinks and more dense
radiators than the previous p12 so the
p12 is the balanced fan whereas the s12
is the open airflow fan and the f12 is
going to be the restrictive airflow
forcing miss fan now these are all quiet
fans so don't get don't let that get out
of your mind
so it includes a lot of new technology
including their hecta perfume teller
which works in tandem with the stator
guide vanes we'll talk about those after
as well as the focus flow frame ok
perfect balance between power and
quietness that's what knocked was all
about so if it didn't do that I'd be
surprised to reduce noise you can see
here they've actually got a little
diagram of the way the airflow gets
broken up by their new stepped Inlet
design so once again more technology
built into the fan to reduce noise noise
the SS o2 bearing is an upgrade from the
SSL version 1 so you can actually see
here they've drawn a little diagram to
them both for us however I am NOT a fan
engineer so I'm afraid I don't know
exactly what they mean by all this but
they say it's even better than the
time-tested SSL bearing which means it's
pretty darn good because I can tell you
guys now the SSL version 1 bearing is
awesome
focus flow frame so designed for
pressure demanding applications such as
heat sinks and radiators got that 11
stator vanes that straighten channel and
focus the airflow so we'll talk about
that in just a moment
actually okay so here's the diagram of
the fan itself this is actually neat
more on these in a moment okay so number
five is the metal bearing shell shell so
in order to guarantee the highest
possible degree of manufacturing
position right there it actually has a
metal shell for the bearing next we've
got integrated anti-vibration pad so
I'll show you those on the fan itself
custom-designed pwm IC with SC D so that
is their new technology to reduce PWM
switching noises and make the fan even
quieter at low speeds varying angular
distance and vortex control notches okay
so we're pretty familiar with these but
with a uniform distribution of the state
of aims the relative geometrical
constellation of the rotor blades and
the stator guide vanes is identical each
time the rotor moves over the next
stator vane so pretty much what they've
done here is they've made everything as
close to being 100% I can't even say
well but yeah they've tried to make it
as symmetrical in as many different ways
as possible
inner surface micro structures so when
the tips of the blades plowing through
the boundary layer created by the inner
surface micro structures flow separation
from the suction side of the blades is
significantly suppressed ultra low power
consumption this I think is less of a
factor for most users the low noise
adaptors that knock to include that
their fans are very very handy I'll show
you that when we open it up extensive
cabling options huh look at that comes
with an extension neat seekeen and a six
year manufacturer warranty
you can't put a six year manufacturer
warranty on anything with moving parts
unless you are prepared for users to
either arm a them or if unless you are
prepared to build a darn good product so
hopefully Noctua has gone actually not
hopefully so Noctua has gone with the
ladder as opposed to the former here are
some fan screws in case you want to
mount your fan that way
here are some rubber fan mounts I would
definitely recommend mounting your fans
that way as it is quieter reduces the
vibration that gets passed to the case
although mind you with the here these
are the integrated grommets with these
integrated grommets even if you screw it
in with
a screw the only vibration that can be
passed would be from this bit of plastic
here to the screw to the case because
right here you're going to be rubber
isolated so these will make it even
better because they go through like that
and they envelop the case on the fan
itself and keep them actually slightly
separated alright so here are the this
is how not to achieves the directed
airflow so you can see the fan blades
pass over the Fen like this and what
these are here for is to actually keep
all of the air moving in one direction
in one tunnel away from the fan frame
itself so that may is part of what makes
it more effective for heat sinks there's
less wasted energy because instead of
blowing the air around in all these
directions you are blowing it in exactly
the direction of exactly what you want
to cool so this would be great for other
applications such as for a front intake
fan where you want to direct that
airflow to your graphics card rather
than just sort of dumping air into the
case you want to take that air directly
to the thing you want to cool use one of
these other included accessories include
the extension cable there you go as well
as oh this is kind of neat it includes a
Wye cable that's outstanding and these
are all pwm cables which actually aren't
that easy to find and aren't that cheap
so that's that's handy as well so you
have a wide variety of different
mounting options you can even mount two
of them off you know one header and you
can put one there and one there and I
love that they've included a nice short
cable because if you're using it as a
CPU fan the last thing you want is a
bunch of extra cable cluttering up your
flowering after case so here's the
stepped Inlet design right there just
want to show you guys some of these
technologies that we talked about before
these are the see these little dimples
inside here whoops can you see them
right there alright so that was one of
the things we talked about before the
blade design actually looks very similar
to the p12 but I'm sure that it's not
because knowing not to uh oh yeah look
at that so the notches are now here and
traditionally we see notches on the
trailing edges of the fans on here so I
think that's pretty much it I think
we've covered most of the technology
we've covered the look of the fan itself
not to his signature brown and cream
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos
sorry guys I forgot the low-noise
adapter which they've now started
sleeving this looks fantastic compared
to the older ones and there we go so you
could mount it way at the end of like
something and then make it low noise in
addition to everything that you're
already doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
