Boxee Box from d-link so if you haven't
seen it already this is the boxy it's a
little cube guy that sits preferably
somewhere near your TV so that you can
stream media from the Internet as well
as from your home network so I know I
had complained initially about some well
a lot of the content being more for us
customers and not really much of it
working in Canada but what I was not
aware of at the time is that yeah that
might may be true for the repositories
bearing in mind that the repositories
that I was looking at are primarily
third-party apps okay but that is
actually not the case for a lot of the
stuff under the show's menu so here's
the perfect example is South Park where
it's listing all of the episodes of
South Park and you can either access
them oh and this is cool check this out
so it actually integrates the ones that
you can access from the Comedy Network
with the ones that you have stored on
your own local server so check this out
so you can play by a local file
apparently I have two copies of this
episode by accident or you can actually
use the ad-supported Comedy Network link
to stream it online so it goes ahead and
sorts all of your media which I don't
have named in any particularly proper
way and and sorts at all according to
the season the episode the show and then
which here here's one I think that I
actually don't have yeah so there you go
that's what I don't have on my home
server so it gives you whatever options
you have available to watch that content
which is pretty cool and boxey's
committed to doing updates as often as
every week or two until they get the
Canadian content situation down to down
to the point where they can actually
filter out most of the stuff that's not
actually available in Canada so I
haven't actually tried any other ones
yet I just went with the South Park
example because I knew it would I knew
it'd be a good example because of
the fact that I have a lot of the South
Park media on my home server but here we
go why don't we try something else why
don't we try The Apprentice a show I
have heard much about but never actually
watched now the loading times for the
web content are not ideal yet although I
believe that is something that they're
working on and they're also working on
the integrated browser to make it to
make it easier to go straight into
full-screen mode to play the media
instead of going to a browser where you
where you actually use the Boxee
controller to maximize to fullscreen and
make any changes that you want to so far
this is what I'd consider a pretty
typical loading time for a show I am
running on a power line home network so
I am NOT on Wi-Fi in case you're
wondering by the way the color of the
TV's just because I did white balance
wrong and so I was showing up kind of
bluey I guess while we wait we can see
my cats who are playing in my Christmas
tree thanks guys that's really useful
Livia
I'm sure glad that you're there to
destroy things and knock down the the
baubles on the tree fortunately I got
the unbreakable kind so I don't have to
worry too much about them you know
getting glass all over the floor well
yeah why don't I fix my light down oh
there we go
hey hey global TV just right now I got
to find the remote which I put down I
love the remote for the block see it's
so awesome
keyboard on one side just general
navigation on the other side it's
awesome so what I'm gonna want to do
when it's done searching for the video
is I can actually use the the d-pad here
to move the mouse around and then I can
I can manually maximize the movie myself
and watch it in full-screen mode just
like that
there we go so I just have to wait for
it to buffer and then it should start
playing here we go video quality is
actually surprisingly good considering
well hold on are you sure you want to
leave this video yeah I want to leave
this video video quality is actually
surprisingly good given that you're
streaming on the Internet but I guess
compared to watching on your computer
you're sitting a lot further away from
the TV so that helps a lot anyway so
that I wanted to show the shows part of
the Boxee menu and demonstrate that that
is content that is ready for Canada so
that's that's pretty cool I don't know
about movies actually but yeah here well
since we're since we're working on this
why don't we just like do that okay so
what movies do we have dragon hunter
legend of the hidden city March
astronauts other people's parties Hitman
Hart NFB that's a quarter so there it is
it was a streamed movie I'm not gonna
wait for this to load right now so I'll
just let you guys know if it was a
similar time I'm gonna just turn the
camera off for now yeah okay that one
didn't work for me and neither did
project grizzly they both sort of tried
to load forever and didn't really work
but they were both hosted on the same
site so maybe supports gonna be improved
for that one in the upcoming firmware
updates but this one worked really well
and actually this is a perfect example
of how this whole thing should work so
it opens up extremely quickly and it's
ready to go just like that so I can
pause it as well who can I fast-forward
even though I can skip ahead
what about fast-forward oh I can skip
ahead a little bit
okay not sure what they're up to but
apparently this is some kind of
psychological adventure movie yeah the
psychological adventure that breaks and
distorts the rules of reality
interesting okay anyway thank you for
checking out my video on I guess both
the shows as well as the movies tabs
within the Boxee Box I think we had a
look at apps already as well as files
files is excellent by the way
and oh yeah I guess I never really
showed the home screen there you go hey
here you go it's gonna show us some cool
stuff that just kind of works oh yeah
YouTube of course is very well supported
by the Boxee so why don't we have a look
at the Angry Birds peace treaty and end
on that note by the way I quite enjoyed
Angry Birds for my iPhone it was
excellent
