boxee box from d-link so if you haven't
seen it already this is the boxee it's a
little cube guy that sits preferably
somewhere near your TV so that you can
stream media from the internet as well
as from your home network so I know I
had complained initially about some well
a lot of the content being more for us
customers and not really much of it
working in Canada but what I was not
aware of at the time is that yeah that
might may be true for the repositories
bearing in mind that the repositories
that i was looking at are primarily
third-party apps okay but that is
actually not the case for a lot of the
stuff under the show's menu so here's
the perfect example is South Park where
it's listing all of the episodes of
south park and you can either access
them oh and this is cool check this out
so it actually integrates the ones that
you can access from the comedy network
with the ones that you have stored on
your own local server so check this out
so you can play by a local file
apparently I have two copies of this
episode by accident or you can actually
use the ad-supported comedy network link
to stream it online so it goes ahead and
sorts all of your media which I don't
have named in any particularly proper
way and and sorts at all according to
the season the episode the show and then
which here here's what I think that I
actually don't have yet so there you go
that's when I don't have on my home
server so it gives you whatever options
you have available to watch that content
which is pretty cool and boxey's
committed to doing updates as often as
every week or two until they get the
Canadian content situation down to down
to the point where they can actually
filter out most of the stuff that's not
actually available in Canada so I
haven't actually tried any other ones
yet I just went with the South Park
example because I knew it would I knew
it'd be a good example because of
the fact that I have a lot of the South
Park media on my home server but here we
go why don't we try something else why
don't we try the apprentice a show i
have heard much about but never actually
watched now the loading times for the
web content are not ideal yet although i
believe that is something that they're
working on and they're also working on
the integrated browser to make it to
make it easier to go straight into
full-screen mode to play the media
instead of going to a browser where you
where you actually use the boxee
controller to maximize to full screen
and make any changes that you want to so
far this is what I'd consider a pretty
typical loading time for a show I am
running on a power line home network so
i am not on Wi-Fi in case you're
wondering by the way the color of the
tvs just because i did white balance
wrong and so is showing up kind of bluey
I guess while we wait we can see my cats
who are playing in my christmas tree
thanks guys that's really useful livia
I'm sure glad that you're there to
destroy things and knock down the the
baubles on the tree fortunately I got
the unbreakable kind so I don't have to
worry too much about them you know
getting glass all over the floor well
here why don't I fix my leg down up
there we go hey hey Global TV I just all
right now I got to find the remote which
I put down i love the remote for the
block see it's so awesome keyboard on
one side just general navigation on the
other side it's awesome so what I'm
going to want to do when it's done
searching for the video is I can
actually use the the d-pad here to move
the mouse around and then I can I can
manually maximize the movie myself and
watch it in full screen mode just like
that
there we go so I just have to wait for
it to buffer and then it should start
playing here we go flexible mortgage oh
well we have one that lets you put extra
money in take it out anytime and skip a
payment once a year it's our video
quality is actually surprisingly good
considering well hold on are you sure
you want to leave this video yeah I want
to leave this video video quality is
actually surprisingly good given that
you're streaming on the internet but I
guess compared to watching on your
computer you're sitting a lot further
away from the TV so that helps a lot
anyway so that I wanted to show the
show's part of the boxee menu and I
demonstrate that that is content that is
ready for Canada so that's that's pretty
cool I don't know about movies actually
but yeah here well since we're since
we're working on this why don't we just
like do that okay so what movies do we
have dragon hunter legend to the hidden
city march astronauts other people's
parties hitman Hart an FBI at Sakura so
there it is it was a streamed movie I'm
not going to wait for this to load right
now so I'll just let you guys know if it
was a similar time I'm gonna just turn
the camera off for now yeah okay that
one didn't work for me and neither did
project grizzly they both sort of tried
to load forever and didn't really work
but they were both hosted on the same
site so maybe supports going to be
improved for that one in the upcoming
firmware updates but this one worked
really well and actually this is a
perfect example of how this whole thing
should work so it opens up extremely
quickly and it's ready to go just like
that so I can pause it as well who can I
fast forward even oh I can skip ahead
what about fast forward oh I can skip
ahead a little bit
okay not sure what they're up to but
apparently this is some kind of
psychological adventure movie yeah the
psychological adventure that breaks and
distorts the rules of reality
interesting okay anyway thank you for
checking out my video on I guess both
the shows as well as the movies tabs
within the boxee box I think we had a
look at apps already as well as files
files is excellent by the way and oh
yeah I guess I never really showed the
home screen there you go here you go
it's going to show us some cool stuff
that just kind of work so yeah YouTube
of course is very well supported by the
boxee so why don't we have a look at the
angry birds peace treaty and end on that
note by the way I quite enjoyed angry
birds for my iphone it was excellent
