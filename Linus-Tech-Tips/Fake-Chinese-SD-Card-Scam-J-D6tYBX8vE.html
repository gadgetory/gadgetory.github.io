all this time we've been paying hundreds
of dollars for big microSD cards but the
greedy corporations have been hiding the
good stuff from us they just pretend
there's a difference between small ones
and big ones so we'll pay more for this
kind of cheap plastic then they unlock
the functionality well you know what
thank you
eBay thank you for helping me see the
light with this one terabyte micro SD
card for $32.99 by the way guys just so
that you don't have any doubt to prove
that these are real
I've actually been buying these things
for all of our cameras we are gonna save
a fortune or maybe not but you could
save a fortune with Mac well Mac well
makes great underwear t-shirts socks
wallets and more and they last for a
long time they believed in simple
shopping if you use code tech tips
you'll get 20% off at the link below
in all seriousness though guys I did
actually buy a couple of these cards but
only for the purpose of shedding some
light on these fake capacity scans and
showing you how they work so um let's
rip this open and take a closer look at
what arrived in the mail so our card in
particular here looks like a verbatim
card on the outside down to even the
little little v logo in the corner let's
get this this baby opened up or at least
it would mostly look like it if it
weren't for this like weird serif font
here that you often find on cheap
Chinese devices what's actually sorry
side note here like if you think about
it it's so ridiculous like obviously
they weren't gonna pay for an expensive
fun but it's not like they paid verbatim
to rip off their logo either why can't
they pirate a decent-looking front and
then the weirdest thing is like if you
look really close the letters are fine
it's just the numbers like they didn't
have numbers and their font pack and
while we're at it why is the Year on
here
Chinese pirates it's like you're not
even trying so moving back to our
packaging here for a second and there's
some claims here high-speed
high-performance waterproof shockproof
those are pretty dubious claims and oh
this is interesting
wow that's funny so it claims 2,000
songs in the mp3 format that's actually
probably our first hint and then our
second hint is gonna be this EAN code
down here so it's eight four three eight
six oh five six three six zero one zero
and if you put that into Google first
hit here is oh the plot thickens a 32
gig micro SDHC that happens to look well
similar it's got the same outer
packaging here as the one that we got
but then
and our card has the rip-off verbatim
markings and then actually this looks
the same - hmm
now there's also apparently a listing
for like a SanDisk USB Drive or
something like that but either way it's
not looking good for this card but you
know what though I'm gonna keep an open
mind so let's go ahead and give it a
shot
all right so showed up and boom look at
that check this capacity out nine
hundred and seventy six gigs and Anthony
has actually already pre-loaded a couple
files on here just to show that it does
in fact work I might need my tinfoil hat
back after all it's a conspiracy the
corporation's look at this where it's
just fine so far so let's go ahead and
grab maybe a bigger file pop this on
here Oh woof oh that is that is not an
impressive speed what how fast is this
thing supposed to be I believe it says
class 10 class 10 that 10 plus or is
that class 10 and a free adapter best
class tanana free afraid out there all
right Lana you know height speed that's
higher than high you know high height -
um actually knows - class 10 is 10
megabytes per second sustained okay in
fairness for them this is indeed ish 10
10 ish I mean not really but I'm gonna
close up I see in class 10 cards that
are held up
yes the minimum right speed so like
class 10 in 2006 I mean it must be legit
right like these guys have got 93
percent positive feedback like they've
actually got positive reviews here and
more and they've got they've got reviews
going back like a year
very good seller delivers what promises
best new one terabyte micro SD I'm happy
with the end of my I was ordered I can
recommend this seller this seems that
shopping cost too high
positive feedback okay buy all your
codes here who that sounds legit
awesome price sell are very helpful
would recommend and buy all your codes
here counselor door instead of have to
pay more for taxes that's the negative
review Anthony thinks it's over writing
existing data and what did I say I
thought it was oh yeah I thought it
might just be like some weird like
caching thing because we were copying
off in the network drive that clearly
isn't it so okay yeah you're probably
right then so oh crap and naturally the
file that I copied is one that we're not
going to be able to play back it's an
MOV I mean I didn't think okay so that
works oh wow when you copy from the oh
it's even worse how because we can't
check these VMs
I really I feel like I'm just watching
paint dry right now I can watching files
transfer but like it's fascinating and I
just I can't look away from it because I
don't know what wizardry this is is this
like a lot of thing some of them are
fake every once in a while they ship for
real ones so they get a positive review
I don't they don't exist what is going
on here okay
so as we can see if you open up all the
files we copy them originally there yeah
cuz it's 47 points for gigs yeah and if
we open up one of those files yeah go
there so it didn't overwrite it so that
was that's my my theory out the window
and obviously we still have 920 games so
all looks good right yeah yeah but these
copies that we made everything you can't
transfer over after 32 gigs whoa it's
fake its fake
okay so then what what why all right so
let's explain what's going on here the
highest capacity legit micro SD card at
the time of writing actually huh that's
convenient
I have one right here is this 512 Giga
what are they called integral that's
right and one of these is gonna run you
a few hundred dollars so obviously those
$30 SD cards that we bought off eBay are
scams but here's the thing if the cards
arrived and they were just completely
non-functioning plastic dummies or if
they showed up in people's computers as
32 gigs well they would immediately
leave negative feedback and file for a
return through eBay's buyer
leading the scammers with no money for
their effort in fact they would lose
money because they would have had to
send something like even a plastic you
know empty junk cost something so that
is why they designed them to misreport
he pulled the capacity thing again and
it's like very convincing but how are
they doing this so this gun is as old as
SD cards themselves be they full-sized
ones or micro ones inside every SD card
as you might expect is flash memory
along with a micro controller so there
at least two chips even on one of these
tiny little guys and that micro
controller is really really small it
manages communication with a host device
like a PC or camera and it has
information like the total size the
physical layout the vendor ID the
Product ID the serial number the date of
manufacture and all of this gets
reported to the host device and the
micro controller acts as a go-between to
fetch / store data from the flash memory
on the SD card it's not unlike an SSD
controller in its overall functionality
but it's much simpler in design and much
lower in both power consumption and
performance so then if you know how to
program or that is reprogram the micro
controller you're able to modify what it
reports to the host including the
capacity and the vendor ID making some
well made fakes these aren't
particularly well made very difficult to
identify or discover the problem with
before your return window is up
so our ei encode investigation likely
revealed the true nature of this beast
which raises the question then I mean
now that we're out our $30.00 anyway is
there a way for us to at least restore
it to a working 32 gig model so we can
at least get some use out of it in a
word no in more words sort of actually
so the card as it is will always report
that it is one terabyte in size unless
we had the expertise and the time to
reprogram its microcontroller again but
what we can do is we can create a small
partition on it that we can then use
normally though there are still some
stumbling blocks that we could hit here
so there are only a handful of factories
in the world that make NAND flash which
means that there's a chance that this
thing is slow but perfectly functional
the issue is that we don't know where it
came from so it could be from like a
small Chinese fab it could be from a
reject bin and a legitimate one or it's
even possible that it was produced
during a so-called third shift when a
legitimate factory that makes authorized
Goods starts up again at night without
the brand owners authorization and
produces more of the same goods to sell
out the back door often without the same
degree of quality control so to figure
out where exactly the flash is there are
a couple of tools that we can use so
there's age to test W by pice high
sensitivity high sir
okay probably that one is by far the
most useful but F three is an open
source Linux alternative and HDD low
level format tool by HD guru is also a
pretty good bet now any partition
creation tool that allows you to specify
where the partition is placed on the
card is gonna help you do this but first
there's a couple things you got to do
you got to get anything important off of
your fake SD card I mean it's just in
general get everything off it as fast as
you can but this whole process is gonna
wipe it anyway if you aren't sure how
much useable space you have by the way H
to test W is the way to go takes a long
time to run though
so naturally we didn't run it but
Anthony actually did some poking around
and figuring out where it should be so
we're just gonna kind of Yolo it and
make a 32 gigabyte partition on the end
of the card since earlier testing
revealed that the beginning was unusable
so how are we doing here so well
actually here
you've done in disc manager so actually
it ended up being the beginning of the
card I thought I was getting yeah
because as it turns out the higher
sector counts that were giving me the
good rights yeah we're actually the
beginning of the drive oh okay
so that's cool I guess we'll see if that
works out and so this is just
unallocated and it doesn't even show up
in any way and this is now a 32 gig SD
card basically I guess that leads us
pretty tightly into our conclusion
should you buy an SD card that you think
might be fake in a word no in more words
hell no in still more words yes but only
for people that you really really don't
like so be on the lookout guys for deals
that look too good to be true from
vendors that you don't recognize because
remember even names that you know and
trust like eBay Aliexpress or even
Amazon mean nothing in cases where the
brand that's actually shipping and
selling the product is not affiliated
with them and remember these guys allow
pretty much anyone to sell their
platforms and not every scam may even be
as obvious as the one we outlined today
some of them for example might have half
of their advertised capacity so you
would have to write a lot of data to
them before you would pick up on it or
they might use slower flash meaning that
your UHS two-class card wouldn't be able
to record 4k video properly in some
cases the capacity and the performance
might even be the same but then when you
go and clean warranty service turns out
it was a counterfeit or reject that's
why we always recommend Linus brand

being a complete and utter scam you can
