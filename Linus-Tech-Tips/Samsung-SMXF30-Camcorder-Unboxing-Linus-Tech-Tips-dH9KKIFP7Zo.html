be checking out the Samsung flash cam
SMX f30
so this is a small small holding
point-and-shoot shoot and share a memory
camcorder their shoot and share that's
what I was looking for so it is YouTube
friendly which is one of the only things
they actually list on the box here it
has a three hour long time battery face
detection focus and time-lapse recording
and then again they tell you okay it's
YouTube friendly so let's get this thing
open
I actually know very little about this
but I'm looking for a camera that can
focus a little bit better close-up on
we're shooting this video with the g7
but I'm actually going to shoot the next
one with this camera just to see how
well it performs when you upload
directly to YouTube which as you can
tell from the box is one of the features
that they're saying is very important
about it so let's start our unboxing
here we've got the samsung user's manual
disc inside so there you go I think this
might actually be two discs no no it's
not it's just a thick heavy one or
something
okay so then you've got a what's
included so you want to make sure that
all the stuff that's on here is actually
in there so this seems to be kind of
like yeah it's a QuickStart guide there
we go comes out some more oh that's a
very long Qwikster Quick Start Guide
awesome so it tells you what's included
selecting the operating mode how to
prepare it for functioning before
recording and then getting the data
actually off it okay so that's great
Quick Start Guide like that and then
we've got what's next here dear valued
customer Oh how to contact their tech
support okay that's good too you know we
usually do sort of more computer
oriented stuff rather than consumer
electronics so this is there's a lot
more hand-holding in here so here's why
to register your product and pre prepaid
sort of thing to register your product
that's great okay so inside we will find
the power adapter there you go
you'll need that third power and you'll
also find an adapter for composite
output so you can plug that into the
camera so you can actually monitor what
you do
right off the camera and I'm assuming
you can also play it back on your TV and
then in here we've got a USB cable so
this is for transferring data off the
camera and then here we've got our
battery this is passed okay it didn't
fail awesome that's good and then here
is oh one of those stupid little things
for the USB cable that you'll probably
not install ok so let's bring out the
camera itself now in terms of general
specs this camera shoots in a widescreen
format so it's a 720 by 4 no sorry it's
480 720 by 480 yep so that's not 720p
it's actually 480p
and it has according to our specs it
okay it has a 42 X Intel assume here so
here is listing the specs again okay
it's YouTube friendly thanks for that
it's got a Schneider cruise nock lens
and then you've got like a handy little
plenary hand strap here this is
adjustable there we go then at the back
you'll find your record button your
power button so you hold that to turn it
on just right here there's a little open
thing so that's where you'll find your
power in there's your your a/v out so
that was the composite video and audio
and then a USB cable here you can change
your mode from camcorder to camera to
playback and then here I guess you can
know you can take a photo and then
here's your zoom and inside you will
find the reasonably large LCD it's not a
touchscreen so you're all your
functionality is going to be over here
accessing the menu and everything over
here is your eye check brightness and
contrast and easy cute so thank you for
checking out my video blog on the
Samsung flash can SMX f30</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
