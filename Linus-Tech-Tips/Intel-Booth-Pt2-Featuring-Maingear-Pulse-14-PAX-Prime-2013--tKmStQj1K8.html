brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steel series so we're here in the
intel booth at pax 2013 there is a ton
of stuff on display here gaming desktops
tablets all kinds of great stuff they're
giving away over forty thousand dollars
worth of processors throughout the show
but behind me here I have the main gear
pulse 14 this is a bit of a unique
notebook because it takes what you would
call a more traditional DIY approach
because obviously main gears roots are
from sort of the custom desktop
background that they started up with and
they've taken a lot of those principles
and applied them to this notebook right
here so let's go through the general
specs it's got a quad-core 4702
processor so that's about as good as you
can get within a 35 watt TDP it's got a
gtx 760m which from a pure performance
standpoint it should give you about
double what you're going to get with a
660m so it's a huge generational
improvement it still maintains a very
slim overall form factor doesn't
compromise on Io so on the left hand
side here you got your power in you got
your ventilation hdmi vga a high yes
still hardwired gigabit ethernet to
super speed USB 3 ports then on the
other side you find another USB 2.0 port
card reader headphone and microphone
jacks the screen runs at 1600 x 900
although a little bird told me it might
be available in even higher resolutions
moving forward the keyboard is a chiclet
type unfortunately not backlit but this
is where things start to get really
interesting the pricing is extremely
aggressive starting at 12 49 and check
this out on the back unfortunately the
base model doesn't include the sexy
paint job for the back of the notebook
so you can see that is a premium
automotive finish main gear figures
their own shop is better than most of
the shops in the jersey area and it is
dedicated to painting not only your pc
but also potentially the accessories
that you acquire with it so check this
out here's a logitech gaming mouse that
has also had the same finish applied to
it now that DIY spirit is back guys
because the storage configuration of the
notebook is extremely flexible in spite
of its small size so 14 inches and very
slim it can accept a two and a half inch
drive so whether it's an SSD or hard
drive doesn't really seem to matter and
to msata ssds all at the same time so
you could actually run two SSDs for boot
and then throw a two and a half inch
hard drive in there for storage giving
you an extremely flexible little system
guys don't miss any of our packs 2013
