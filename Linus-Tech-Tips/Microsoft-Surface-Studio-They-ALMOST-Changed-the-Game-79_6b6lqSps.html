okay so that wasn't an ad this video
isn't sponsored by Microsoft it's just a
fun little skit that we decided to do
but the Microsoft studio is a huge
departure from the spreadsheets and word
processors image that Microsoft has had
and even embraced in the past as a
company whose bread and butter has
pretty much always been businesses one
of the most immediately
attention-grabbing features of the
surface studio is its aptly named studio
mode where the display moves with
incredible ease on the zero-gravity
hinge from a vertical position down to
just 20 degrees an angle that was
specifically chosen because it perfectly
matches a standard drafting table in
this position it is not only stable but
it is optimized for natural interactions
with the surface pen and the surface
dial which we will check out in more
detail later on for now let's take a
moment to talk about it's impressive 28
inch 3 by 2 aspect ratio 4500 by 3000
resolution pixel sense display this
aspect ratio will naturally give you a
lot more actual surface area than a
similar widescreen monitor in the more
cinematic 16 by 9 aspect ratio that has
become standard on modern devices but
that's not it's only interesting feature
it has 13.5 million pixels at a density
of 192 PPI which
may not seem earth-shattering at first
but consider this Windows since the
1980s has been written for 96 dpi
meaning that at 192 you can run Windows
10 at exactly 200% scaling and avoid the
text is ring and visual artifacts that
show up at other scaling percentages or
with other dpi counts in Windows with
the surface studio at 200% scaling you
get the great image clarity of the
higher resolution but the usability of
larger icons and for those of you still
printing documents 12-point font on the
display is identical to 12-point font on
a printed page and if you hold up a
piece of paper to the screen one inch on
the paper is 1 inch on the screen just
like the old days and that's not the
only thing that makes it look amazing
each and every display is color
calibrated at the factory to guarantee
color accuracy and precision which are
not the same thing by the way it's the
thinnest LCD monitor ever built at this
size with color profiles of srgb DCI p3
and vivid and they even threw in
10-point multi-touch for those who after
seeing it for the first time want to get
the hands-on experience moving on to the
base of the surface Studios display we
have the entire computer actually they
fit everything in here that runs the
screen and I do mean to say it that way
it almost feels like there's been a role
reversal here where the computer feels
like an accessory to the display instead
of the other way around to help you
understand what I mean by this we'll
need to take a look at the specs our
unit comes equipped with the mobile
intel core i7 6820 HQ processor and a
mobile graphics card last generations
nvidia gtx 980m along with 32 gigs of
DDR 4 RAM and a 2 terabyte hybrid drives
rocking 128 gigs of solid-state storage
at $4,200 this is unsurprisingly the
highest end model but don't imagine that
the base version is particularly
affordable either it costs $3,000 and
drops down to a core i5
eight gigs of RAM an anemic gtx 960 5m
and hacked the storage and no it's not
user upgradeable iFixit gave it a 5 out
of 10
due to its soldered ram cpu and GPU and
you can't buy the screen by itself and
you can't even use the screen once the
hardware becomes outdated by just
plugging in another computer there are
no video inputs just a singular video
output in the form of mini DisplayPort
on the back also the back is an Ethernet
jack a full sized SD card reader for
type a USB 3 5 gigabit ports and a
headphone and microphone jack that's it
so pretty bare-bones for a desktop
computer but there is actually a rather
cool grip release AC power cable that
won't give way to random tugs that's
what kind of interesting back to the
hardware let's talk about performance
the surface studio is using not just
mobile technology but last gen mobile
tech from both Intel and NVIDIA which
means that while using it is smooth and
the vast majority of still art
applications like Adobe Photoshop or
Microsoft own fresh paint and of course
you can edit videos on it it's limited
expandability and unexceptional specs i
mean it doesn't feel like a high-end
video editing workstation which was
really disappointing to our editors here
who were amped about using the dial for
Timeline scrubbing and other cool stuff
on the surface and whatever it is those
guys do all day and then that excitement
was kind of lost Microsoft's response to
this criticism was that they were
limited due to their design window
making the surface studio work with
these new technologies would have
involved reengineering the thermal
design but I can think of other
solutions
why don't allow people to buy the screen
and run their own more powerful
computers like Wacom does with their
Cintiq line products which I guess
actually leads us into that comparison
can the surface to do penetrate Wacom
stranglehold on the professional digital
writing
this market well it holds up find the
screen looks great and the huge surface
area is awesome but artists including
our neighbors Steve who's pretty great
at things have issues with the surface
pen not being as accurate in terms of
pressure when compared to offerings from
the other side in the box you get a
surface to do a surface pen a surface
keyboard a surface Mouse a fancy surface
power cord and that's it no surface dial
but before you go back to Microsoft in a
Haasan purchase the dial that you
assumed was included in the box
considering how prominently they
featured it and like all of its
advertising you might want to keep a few
things in mind one it works with all
Bluetooth equipped Windows 10 pcs which
is nice it's not just a surface device -
there is a relatively simple Windows
wheel API for application developers to
integrate its functionality with their
programs but outside of developers
developers developers it is not user
programmable in the same way it's
something like a Lodge Dekker razor
keyboard would be sorry Tarin no fancy
custom macros at least not yet
and three you're probably just going to
be using this thing on your desk not on
the screen and if you want to use it
that way you'll be constantly moving it
on and off of the display that whole
thing looked super cool in their video
but if you just leave it on your screen
it will ever so slowly slide downwards
unfortunate as it almost hangs on even
at relatively high angles the dial is
very cool with its 3,600 points of
precision and this beautiful modern
design but it feels like it's more
something that will be used because it's
nice and it's easy rather than because
it's useful for hardcore professional
use so in conclusion the surface studio
is one of the most interesting product
releases in my opinion of 2016 hands
down and I mean that about all aspects
of the experience from just opening the
box and seeing how they designed their
uniquely elegant product
dodging all the way to the specs of the
computer itself and these truly
courageous and unapologetically artistic
screen this is a new direction for
Microsoft and one that I'm excited to
see them continue to explore it's
expensive but for high-end consumers
it's a very cohesive experience and as
for professionals I don't expect to see
sin peaks in the garbage behind all the
local design houses just yet
but if the circus Pro is anything to go
by give it a generation or two and we
could be looking at a very different
landscape

launch of a new version of their cloud
