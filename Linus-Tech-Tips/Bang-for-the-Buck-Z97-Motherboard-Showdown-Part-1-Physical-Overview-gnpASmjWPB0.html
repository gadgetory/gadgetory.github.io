100 ish dollars ed 97 motherboard
showdown
now we normally focus on really
expensive top to your motherboards which
are essentially made out of unobtainium
and as we've actually demonstrated
before on this very channel they don't
really have a huge impact in performance
in a negative or positive way
it's the 100 ish dollar motherboards
that the majority of people are actually
going to buy and that's why we decided
to make this series to help people
understand the pros cons and trade-offs
that they're going to be making when
shopping for a value motherboard and in
this episode we will be focusing on the
physical features of the boards
themselves the beginning and the end of
what many people are shopping for on
motherboards but as you'll see in the
rest of videos in this series there's a
lot more to it than that so stay tuned
ensure swift victory with Corsairs
highly responsive lightweight Gaming
Mouse the Sabre RGB click now to learn
more one of the big sales pitches from
other boards is the F Fraser
future-proof and that's how a lot of
people end up paying 300 plus dollars
for a motherboard so they have room to
upgrade and I guess there's something to
be said for having a bazillion SATA
ports USB ports and headers and PCI
Express slots but if you give your
future plans some real thought you might
realize that you're more likely than not
to add a standalone ass than 18 freaking
internal hard drives and if you really
need that storage space I mean where are
you gonna find a case for all that
anyways and you're unlikely to need 10
USB 3.0 ports as well because by the
time you do it might be time for a new
motherboard with USB 3.1 anyways so the
only real problem future-proof wise for
a value board is that you need to look a
bit more closely before you pull the
trigger something I could save you so
much money that you could literally buy
two motherboards one now and one later
when you want to upgrade for the same
price some stuff is less obvious
than hard drives or USB ports though and
while people that end up buying high-end
motherboards will often have room in the
budget for a fancy fan controller the
value builder will want to make sure
that their motherboard can actually
support all the fans that they want to
put in their case otherwise they'll be
stuck running fans at full speed
connected to the power supply or leaving
fan slots on their case
empty to save some money speaking of
fans and cooling our physical overview
included a look at the cooling
capabilities of the motherboard this was
interesting because while we expected
the dramatically different looking
heatsink and vrm designs to yield
significant differences in vrm and
motherboard temperatures especially
based on the fancy heat camera imagery
we've seen in motherboard a versus
competitor screenshots over the years
and what we really got was a couple
degrees here there which is pretty much
within the margin of error of our
infrared thermometer the good news is
that while all of these value boards had
slightly different temperatures they all
stayed within the operating temperatures
of the boards but please note our CPU is
not overclocked so your mileage may vary
if you decide to crank things up a bit
now with super high-end boards you could
assume that they'll support at least
two-way crossfire and two-way SLI
but with value boards you might discover
that the board has multiple PCI Express
slots but lacks the certification or
appropriate bandwidth allocation for
some multi-gpu configurations so while
these boards all support an AM B
crossfire they did not all support SLI
of course a ton of you will not be
running SLI on 100-ish dollar
motherboards but it is a nice feature if
you are an Nvidia user and plan to be
picking up a cheap used graphics card
sometime in the future to breathe life
back into your build may be something to
keep in mind for the long run some
general build quality observations we
made were things like the heat sinks on
the board if and if they were secured by
screws or pushpins I personally prefer
screws as they're less likely to become
dislodged in chipping or deteriorate as
the board heats and cools over its
lifespan we also checked how the locking
mechanism worked for the PCIe 16x slots
Alliance and I both prefer when the wing
design has an included notch for the
screwdriver so that if we need to push
it down in that way we won't risk a slip
which could result in us stabbing the
motherboard the normal wing design is
fine in the top slot because you can
more easily get at it with a finger and
neither of us are a fan of the pull-tab
design which is resulted in scraped
knuckles for both of us at some point in
time or another in the past and last but
not least in our speeds and feeds run
down here is the warranty while this
isn't a physical feature it will ensure
that you have physical features to talk
about for a specified amount of time
warranties are important at all levels
of purchasing decisions but especially
when you're purchasing a value computer
because you probably don't have the
spare cash to just be swapping out dead
boards all the time although warranty
can probably be ignored entirely if you
plan on doing something silly like
dunking all your computer components in
mineral oil one other point here is that
checking with buddies especially ones
who live in the same part of the world
as you is a great idea and a good due
diligence best practice kind of thing to
do because the quality of warranty
services for a given brand can vary
dramatically from from one region to
another
so in summary again this video was
essentially just a physical feature
comparison with the main point being
that at any given price point you won't
actually find many huge differences that
show up on a spec sheet and that by
shopping by specifications alone you
could lead to the conclusion that it
doesn't really matter what you buy but
that's not the case and in our future
videos we'll cover things like how easy
the board is to build with how finely
tuned the UEFI BIOS is to navigate and
the finish system experience of each
motherboard now this might feel a bit
counterintuitive but because
motherboards all perform an overclock
basically the same these days thanks to
Intel moving most of the features that
affect those characteristics on to the
CPU itself throughout this series we
will continue to focus on features
usability build quality and quality of
life differences on these motherboards
instead so with that in mind let us know
if you have any suggestions for things
you'd like us to touch on and put those
