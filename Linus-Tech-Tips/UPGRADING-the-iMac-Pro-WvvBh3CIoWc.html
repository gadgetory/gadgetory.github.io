even I run into some kind of an issue
where the only viable solution is to use
a Mac in my case it was that I was
trying to work on a review of this
archival tape storage backup system and
the Windows software experience was to
put it as politically correctly as I can
awful so my solution some kind of Mac
machine with 10 gigabit networking and
getting that going on the MacBook Pro
wasn't gonna be a thing because even
though I found a network card with
literally the exact same chipset that is
in the iMac Pro and plugged it into an
external enclosure
Nach OS just wouldn't pick it up because
whatever you Linus so I dug the iMac Pro
boat and then I went alright the whole
reason we were opening this stupid thing
up in the first place was that I fix it
sponsored us to do a video on how to
upgrade it so I guess that's what we're
gonna do we're gonna go from 8 cores and
32 gigs of ram to theoretically a
hundred and twenty eight gigs of ram and
18 cores all while saving $1,000 sounds
pretty good right let's hope it works
oh you cut audio as well I did not cut
out um but he did cut the audio so it's
not gonna sound very good sorry about
that
step one of any upgrade is to run some
benchmarks to establish a baseline
okay it's done all right so this gives
us some idea of where we're starting
here's our 32 gigs of ram we've got as
yon w 21 4 TB so this is fairly similar
although not exactly the same as the
21:45 that's worth about $1,100 so our
base imac pro upgraded compared to
buying a top-of-the-line model from
apple in the first place gives us a
difference of about two hundred and
fifty dollars and we're still gonna have
an eight core processor and 32 gigs
around to flip on Craigslist we'll be
using our iFixit kit along with one of
their guides to complete our upgrade
starting with cutting the adhesive
around the edge of the display and
disconnecting the three ribbon cables
before carefully putting it aside and
all without breaking it
take not after me that's okay he knows
what he did first order of business is
we remove the fan you just need to turn
them counterclockwise until they start
making that noise and they're gonna be
retained by the little rubber washers
that are in there
now there's two little connectors here
one right there one right there
those power of the fans you can just
pull these out be very careful around
this power supply no touchy
you could actually die next we're gonna
pull out Apple is excellent what I find
hard and we're gonna stash those screws
along with this handy-dandy little
shield right about there
is that it now all we got to do is pull
some of these other cables out and
they're covers and we can go ahead and
pull this board out and all these little
antenna connectors these guys are gonna
come off - these are really fragile RF
shield or something no no no that's
getting in my way I don't I could make
my life easier by making it temporarily
much harder it's old its peak bro it's
kind of new as I say not as I do moment
we're having right now high boards out
and I didn't get that
so now that we've got this opened up for
our upgrade we can talk about what
exactly in the iMac pro is upgradeable
because frankly it's not much over the
years Apple has gone from with the
original Mac Pro being very upgradable
PCI Express cards CPUs GPUs RAM storage
pretty much everything just like the
normal Tower to the new Mac Pro the
trashcan Mac Pro that theoretically had
upgradable GPUs but I don't know if they
ever actually followed up with anything
newer pad upgradeable ran and had
upgradeable CPU and storage if you were
willing to put a lot of work into it to
this iMac Pro we're even so the GPU is
actually baked right into the
motherboard here so that's where our
Vega 56 is so that will not be
upgradeable to the storage so the
storage theoretically can be pulled off
and replaced but because of this t 2
encryption chip is actually tied into
the motherboard in such a way that if
you swap them out it wouldn't work and
pretty much only the CPU and RAM are
upgradable and I mean the CPU is even a
theoretical one I don't know if anyone
has actually done a CPU swap on it yet
it's possible that they've even locked
out the BIOS so I'm not a hundred
percent certain if that aspect of this
upgrade is going to work
so let's find out shall we we have to
take off these stickers here that were
the problem and the reason that Apple
refused to give us their replacement
pricing on the logic board so
technically it's not that they're
denying us warranty service but they
were definitely treating us differently
whether it is legal for them to treat us
differently because of a sticker having
been broken or not is something that is
very much an ongoing debate and
something that if you're done in the US
you should probably contact your local
congressman old representative about so
there's eight screws that we're gonna
have to pull off wow there's a lot of
tension on those mounds I'm having fun
you never fun oh yeah good times
it was right metal on PCB how
interesting so you might not think that
we'd have to remove the screws from the
GPU here but the reason that we do is
actually because the entire cooling unit
is one piece so it's connected by heat
pipes between both CPU and GPU to these
metal cooling fins here holy crap okay I
did not see that one coming
what the heck Apple so they don't use
the retention mechanism for the CPU that
is normally part of the socket design I
guess to save some space on the board
which means that when you take the
heatsink off just shoot Rip's the CPU
right out of the board fortunately that
came out clean so I don't think we're
gonna run into any trouble and Apple
expects even their authorized service
providers to get boards with CPUs ran
and SSDs pre-installed on them as a
single unit even though they are
socketed and they are not soldered so I
guess this isn't supposed to be a
problem for the end user but I'm still
not a fan of designs like this
the thermal paste it pulls the CPU out
of the socket what good guy kidding
anyway enough about that this is upgrade
guide not complain about the process
guide so right here around the CPU
socket area is pretty much everything we
can do so we're gonna pull out our eight
gig sticks of RAM so we're gonna be
careful here not to have them pop out of
the slot because if they did they could
accidentally bend the pins in the CPU
socket then we're gonna go ahead and
take our 18 cores
currently Intel's highest end
workstation chip there we go so they
haven't done anything funky with the
spec of the socket just goes in a little
something like that now we get to crack
open the seals on two grand worth of
memory look at all the do you RAM
packages on this thing find that bad boy
up one foois the only thing I regret is
using a green PCB so now we get to
Pipitea pop our cooling solution back on
I'm gonna have to I'm probably just
gonna reuse the thermal compound for the
GPU but this CPU situation might need a
little bit of help I gotta like pry this
baby out of here oh okay well I was
easier than it looked like it was going
to be ready
so we're gonna put on some new thermal
compound here what just pop that on just
like that oh oh okay we made one small
mistake we're gonna have to put in these
two RAM sticks afterward hey don't blame
me
you guys subscribed to this mess pop
that back in there alright let's go
ahead and turn this over
I'll get that bolted down now with our
upgrades done we're gonna flip the
machine back over now it is really
important because of the way that CPU is
just gonna pop out of the socket if we
move the heat pipe cooler we're gonna
make sure we hold that in place oh boy
oh boy
yep hold that in place against the board
oh good our CPU didn't pop up then we're
gonna go ahead and put our mounting
bracket on the back back on now this is
a little bit tricky here because there
are two different kinds of screws you
need to make sure you put the right ones
in the right holes so the ones with the
kind of built-in standoff on them those
go the orientation we were looking at
the board here top left and bottom right
ones with the much shorter posts those
go top right bottom left if you screw
this up best-case scenario you've got
kind of wonky mounting pressure worst
case scenario you will damage your board
boy this is a lot more pressure and I'm
comfortable putting on a motherboard I
hate these mounts okay go on yes
now the GPU is not nearly as scary
because there's no pins that you can
accidentally rip the CPU out of and then
accidentally put it in sideways and
mangle them up or anything oh by the way
I'm sorry off-camera I did wipe the
thermal compound off the GPU and I did
reapply but I'm not gonna pull this back
off to show you guys that so to put our
GPU cooler back on see these little
cutouts right here so just look at these
two holes here and then the shape of the
components underneath them and you won't
be able to screw up which one goes which
way
in this case all the screws are the same
so we just go ahead and position these
bad boys and then screw em down once
again applying far more pressure than I
am super comfortable with yeah beautiful
that is our upgraded logic board and
they said it couldn't be done now to put
it together and find out if it works one
thing we're gonna do to make our lives a
little bit easier compared to when Lewis
and I did this is we're gonna pull out
the speaker's put those back in after
we've installed the logic board there we
go actually that should be fine all
right
one of the keys at this stage is making
sure that you don't accidentally cover
up some of the connectors that you're
going to need to plug back into your
motherboard now the last thing we want
to do is accidentally scratch the PCB
with one of these standoffs here while
we're inserting the board this is one
nice thing about the design they've got
this rubber stopper here so you can't
let it fall down anything now let's go
around and do our motherboard screws I'm
gonna arbitrarily pick this one to start
with
I want those as centered as possible
because it can affect the alignment of
your rear ports if you don't have the
board in perfectly we're gonna need to
lift up this side of the board here a
little bit perfect I'm gonna do these
power ones now there we go
Oh beautiful okay one little trick guys
this speaker connector right here has
this little loop here so we're gonna go
ahead and put that on just partway we're
gonna plug it in shoot
then we're gonna tighten it down while
we're at it we can start connecting some
of the back rub in cables go alright
we're gonna check our rear port
alignment at this point looking pretty
slick alright now we're gonna throw in
our other two power screws tighten those
up you don't want to lose connection
here there we go
and we can start connecting the rest of
the connectors on the back of our board
okay we can go ahead and put our speaker
back in at this point to house that
cable managed feeling good now now we're
gonna hook up all the antennas these are
really fragile connectors please be
careful now we're just gonna stick this
shield into its little cable management
slot here there we go it should sit on
kind of a little hinge like that then
we're gonna adjust these antenna wires
and screw it in now this motherboard
mounting screw we're gonna have to take
out temporarily we're gonna put this
little shield in place screw it back in
part way screw in the other side being
very careful not to drop it I'm doing
all of the work we just did and we can
go ahead and tighten down our
motherboard screw all right now we're
gonna throw the speakers in and we are
almost home free where did this go yep
now we've got a somewhat obnoxious task
ahead of us because the display is glued
on it means we've got to remove all of
the old adhesive so this will take a
little while dumb alcohol in there - all
right so now that that's all off let
stretch up my arm a little bit here all
that is left is for us to put on new
adhesive strips and put on the screen be
really careful with these you don't get
two cracks at them so you can see they
got this little hole up here for
alignment or whatever it's for nailed
that one next these last two along the
bottom are the trickiest just because
this kit was designed as far as I can
tell with the original retina iMac in
mind and there might be just some slight
ever so slight differences so you're
gonna have like this little tab doodad
here that kind of doesn't really go
anywhere it's not a big deal I don't
know maybe it goes along this thing here
that really doesn't matter there boom
minor detail guess I better put the
cooler back in hello well and also these
two screws right there now the trickiest
part removing the adhesive strips
putting the display back on we're gonna
put on these three cables first though
Apple's gonna be watching this video
they're gonna be like we want to recruit
- to be an Apple authorized service
provider looks like it goes right there
yep and then the latch down boom
looks like that one went in super easy
miss Kay Boop never a problem no no this
is not attached this is very scary
but I want to know if this thing powers
on before I waste my adhesive and an
hour of my life peeling it all back off
and reapplying it again so let's go
ahead and get this plugged in and see
how she goes there we go ha okay Jesus
had me going for a minute there I don't
use Mac's much I don't know how long
they take - good huh
whatever let's get this keyboard mouse
up let's see how much performance we got
well now we're not out of the woods yet
there is a distinct possibility that
some of our stuff might not have been
detected so okay nevermind that ruins
the
the suspense and anticipation because
there it is Intel Xeon w21 95 that's our
18 core processor with 128 gigs of DDR 4
memories so let's run our benchmark
shall we so a quick google search online
tells me it should be in the
neighborhood of 50,000 come on show me
the big score there it is so we just
crushed our old performance we are right
up there with the regular factory Apple
iMac Pro with the 18 core but we saved
ourselves a bunch of money and of course
the expense of our time fantastic this
thing is now officially tricked right
out and of course this video wouldn't
have been possible without iFixit
sponsoring it so a massive thank you to
