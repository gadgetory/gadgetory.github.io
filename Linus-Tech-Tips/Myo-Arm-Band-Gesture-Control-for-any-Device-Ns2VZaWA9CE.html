to interact with my computer I was very
early adopter of the oculus rift and I
am what seems to be one of the like 30
people that actually bought an OC zinnia
also known as the OC Zed neural impulse
actuator so when I saw that the meal
from thalmic labs has arrived I got
pretty excited this device will
theoretically allow me to control tons
of things on my computer and on my phone
through the use of my arm muscles and
movements awesome but does it live up to
the hype or will it largely be forgotten

during Valentine's week February 14th to
21st 2015
click now to learn more to start off
we'll take a closer look at the physical
unit along with a small teal Bluetooth
adapter and teal micro USB cable you
have the Myo itself it looks very sci-fi
inspired overall and comes in either
white or a black design the band is
expandable between 7.5 and 13 inches
depending on your forearm circumference
using the sizing clips and it weighs
about 93 grams overall on the inside is
packing an arm cortex-m for processor a
bunch of stainless steel EMG sensors and
a 9 axis IMU containing a 3-axis
gyroscope a three axis accelerometer and
a three XS magnetometer for feedback for
the user it also has dual indicator LEDs
and a haptic feedback vibration which
has modes for short medium and extended
sensation duration as I call it or just
long for normal people the setup process
for the device is pretty straightforward
download the software off the maya
website load up the getting started
guide pull everything in run the
firmware update which you'll probably
have named your device and follow the
instructions on how to put it on which
is essentially just put it around the
widest part of your forearm
once you're done getting your Myo
properly situated at the wait a few
minutes for it to heat up literally the
sensors will heat up from your body heat
and once you've done all that you'll
have to do the sink gesture and then
you're good to go
right off the bat Miele is ready and
able to work with a variety of apps
including things from PowerPoint and
Adobe Reader to Netflix and VLC but you
can download hooks for other apps from
the Miele market well the market already
has some good additions like Windows
Media Player and a multi browser control
hook there are some issues as well for
some applications there are multiple
hooks some of which clearly don't work
and it would be nice if this was cleaned
up in the future also some of the gaming
hooks like Minecraft are a little silly
in my opinion I was excited at first but
make a fist to attack I'm really not
excited to make a fist over and over and
over again for hours while I dig a
tunnel under my buddy's castle to fill
up with TNT which brings us to actually
using the device
the controls are each app are usually
independent but there are some
similarities between them wave left is
usually just rewind or back waving right
is usually fast forward or next
spreading your fingers is usually a
start or stop signal making a fist and
using it for a dial light control like
possibly volume or making a fist and
doing something serious like attack in
Minecraft now you might be asking
yourself a lot it's like it one of all
the things I do throughout the day with
my hands like chopping vegetables or
using a mouse or do you know no problem
usually the mile will be locked so
random gestures and your day-to-day
movements won't be sending inputs to
your it's a computer phone or maybe
tablet and unlocking the Myo is as
simple as tapping your index finger and
thumb together this is where you may
have already guessed it that trouble
starts for much of my testing I used
music players because the effects of the
miles input would be easily apparent
even if I wasn't sitting at my computer
if I use speakers and the biggest issue
with the mile in my opinion and the
reason why I had to stop using it in the
first place is the poorly implemented
unlock feature to put this into
perspective I'll start off with using my
Maya on my desktop computer I'll pour
myself some cereal about ten feet away
from my computer be active opening the
box and pouring the actual cereal first
unlocked the device and changed the
volume change the song and then stop
playing the music altogether then
pouring the milk started the music again
changed the song again change the volume
again not exactly smooth and to give a
little bit more intimate I had to go to
the wash about 20 25 feet away
wiping changed the volume and pulling my
pants up change the song so next I
figured let's try the Myo it on my phone
you can use it to play air guitar 2048
or to control a music player but once
again there were some challenges like
one time I went out for a run throughout
my workout the mile was constantly
unlocking and locking again which meant
it was vibrating on and off the whole
time luckily due to how I held my hands
it didn't really detect any other inputs
unless they were intentional so the
overall experience wasn't too bad but it
definitely drives my point home further
the lock function so in conclusion I'm
not all that sold not for $200 at least
I tried using this as an all-day device
but found it to be very annoying very
quickly every time Tomic labs needs to
do some serious work on gesture
recognition especially for locking and
unlocking I mean Armin van Buuren was
able to use it pretty well for his
concerts apparently but he had a
dedicated programmer following him
around and tuning it specifically for
him this isn't exactly a luxury most of
us have hardware is hard hardware
startups have been trendy lately but it
is just as difficult it is as ever to
pull off especially since the challenge
of tightly integrated software and
firmware along with your hardware is
something that has been notoriously bad
on a lot of these crowd funded projects
so as per usual using the finished
product had the effect of whetting my
appetite as opposed to satisfying my
desire for a solid arm mounted motion
controller what I will say for it is
that this is a very compelling first
attempt and thalmic labs has definitely
caught my attention enough for me to
watch for future firmware and software
updates and even maybe some hardware
iterations that will hopefully fix some
things like overall improving Vee
experience if there's anything that I'd
like to say to the development team it
would be that I think stopping
unintentional inputs needs to be a
priority and I wouldn't be surprised if
they resorted to a hardware iteration
that added a two stage lock of some sort
keeping the top gesture for frequent use
and adding voice control or a hardware
button to ensure that inputs stop
entirely when needed speaking of inputs
and outputs we use xsplit every week for
the LAN show which I have to actually
host in a couple of hours and so does he
and with this voice like it is today
that is not going to be that easy
so xsplit is a new sponsor for us and

show xsplit powers countless live
