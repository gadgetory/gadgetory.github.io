have not been held captive at Intel's
headquarters since releasing a video
stating I did not agree with Intel's
direction for the X 299 platform but if
that were the case
I'm sure Intel would have treated me
very well I would also like to go up
like to go on record as stating that in
reference to my statements in that video
that I that that I was then I stand by
everything I said
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description okay so silly
intro aside obviously I have spoken to
Intel since we made this video I've
expressed my concerns and you know what
they're big boys and girls who can
handle a bit of constructive criticism
so obviously we're still working
together X 299 then let's do a short
recap for those of you who didn't see
our previous video Intel's brand new
core eye 9 chips plug into motherboards
with a brand-new LGA 2066 socket that's
connected to a brand new chipset X 299
that features more updated I owe more
PCI Express Lanes and a 4 Lane DMI 3.0
link ooh and finer overclocking controls
so pretty straightforward more and more
better what's less straightforward and
how you take this is up to you is that
the socket now handles 2 separate
generations of CPUs the first skylake X
is about what you would expect it's this
year's enthusiasts grade high core count
processor based on last year's quad core
max consumer grade processor so we get
some fancy architectural improvements we
get turbo boost max that bumps up 2
cores instead of only one and finally
support for avx-512 outside of Xeon and
the second is KB Lake X in an attempt to
appease hardcore overclockers Intel
basically took their consumer grade KB
Lake chips disabled their integrated
graphics processors and glued them onto
bigger packages with better power
delivery characteristics and bigger heat
spreaders Intel hope
that these chips will be a boon to folks
who don't have a thousand dollars for a
core i9 today but want to have a solid
upgrade path in the future for my part I
feel like only being able to populate
half of the RAM slots on a quad channel
board and having PCI Express bandwidth
potentially cut to less than half is a
really confusing experience though I
would love to hear from you guys in the
comments if you feel differently but
wait what
less PCIe bandwidth I thought you said
more okay so for the top end core I
nines we actually get more than ever
44 versus 40 on the previous flagship
6950 X where that potentially less than
half bit comes from is that anything
other than a core I 9 gets far less as
few as only 16 which could affect the
performance of demanding enthusiast
features like SLI 10 gigabit networking
MDOT to raid or Thunderbolt 3 and on the
subject of MDOT to raid it looks like V
Rock doesn't have pricing yet an Intel
actually isn't quite sure how they're
going to roll that out but the good news
is you can boot from nvme raid if it
goes through the chipset without doing
any of that stuff it's only if it goes
through the CPU that the V Rock module
is going to come into play so let's get
into benchmarks then we unfortunately
didn't get a KB Lake X CPU in time for
this video but we did get the 10 core
core I 970 900 X the least expensive
option with the full 44 PCI Express
Lanes this along with our nifty AF asus
prime x 299 deluxe some overclocking
elbow grease all x 200 compatible chips
are unlocked and some validated memory
from g.skill gives us
our main test bench today for comparison
we'll be looking at the Z 270 based core
i7 7700 K our X 99 bench featuring last
gens much more expensive 10 core and
while we don't have thread Ripper yet
we've thrown AMD's rise in 1800 X into
the fray for comparison so when gaming
there's clearly no major difference
between any of our CPUs at 4k 1080p
tells a bit of a different tale but
frankly none of this is a surprise
clock speed is still king when it comes
to games and until properly implemented
Vulcan and DirectX 12 games are
commonplace that isn't going to change
anytime soon as for productivity this is
cool one interesting aspect of skylake
X's design is that it moves from relying
heavily on a ton of level 3 cache to
relying more on its higher speed level 2
cache so we're broad well II had 256
kilobytes of level 2 per core skylake X
has all whopping 1 Meg each and the
level 3 becomes what's known as a victim
cache so where one core might look for
data in the level 3 find it isn't there
but in another cores level to where it
can then get pushed to the level 3 cache
that leaves the most relevant cached
data in the fastest cache more often
which results in some of the performance
gains that we're seeing here which is
great given how core i9 is intended to
be used in everything from high-end
gaming rigs to high-end workstations so
core I 970 900 X 10 great performance
and compared to Broadway Lee great price
great release then right in a vacuum
yes but the elephant that hasn't yet
entered the room is AMD's thread Ripper
Intel is faced with the disadvantage of
having shot first with X to 99
mine and AMD has some time to tweak
their upcoming thread Ripper CPU lineup
which it said will be available with up
to 16 cores and 64 PCIe lanes so they
could put the gears to Intel on pricing
at which time Intel who's 12 14 16 and
18 core models will be arriving between
August and q4 of this year we'll have to
figure out how to respond if at all so
you know what I am still frustrated that
it took Intel this long to wake up and I
do still think that the CPU lineup is
unnecessarily confusing but whatever
their motivation
AMD's innovation or their unconditional
love for enthusiasts it is true this is
a great release because we're back to
Intel and AMD playing leapfrog and that
is just great synergy solves once and
for all the problem of having two
keyboards and two mice at your desk it
lets you share a single mouse and
keyboard between two or more computers
so you'll no longer confuse which one is
for which you just move the mouse across
they offer a basic and pro option with
one-time payment for lifetime access and
they have tons of great features like
clipboard sharing between the computers
dragging and dropping files between them
the ability to set up hotkeys and even
the ability to use computers with
different operating systems we're
talking Windows we're talking Mac we're
even talking Linux so use our link in
the video description and get 50% off of
synergy today or tomorrow but don't wait
too long so thanks for watching guys if
this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button and maybe check out
where to buy the stuff we featured at
the link in the video description also

which has cool shirts like this one and
