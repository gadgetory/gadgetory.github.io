three from digital storm a boutique
built gaming PC that caught the eyes of
a lot of enthusiasts for its striking
good looks but as attractive as it was
we know that many of you swear by
building your own rigs exclusively like
I do so today we're taking a look at the
slightly bigger brother to the case from
the bolt three the Leon Lee PCO 6s which
supports up to micro ATX instead of just
mini ITX it's available on its own so
you can fill it with whatever goodies
you like without paying a premium to
have it pre-built so what's it like to
assemble a PC inside of it let's dive
right in

Leon Lee has been famous for making
aluminum PC cases with interesting looks
anyone remember the Train case yeah
that's kind of what they're known for
the PC o6s is no exception not only do
you get a completely aluminum body but a
side panel made of actual tempered glass
beautiful no plastic or acrylic none of
that stuff this makes your components
look downright dramatic especially if
you throw some nice lighting into your
case if you think its beauty is a thing
to behold you can display your work of
art on the wall the PCO success is wall
mountable so that's pretty cool but if
you do just want it to be on your
freaking desk it can be oriented in
either horizontal or vertical positions
on your desk with the use of the stand
if you want it to be in the vertical
position let's go ahead and start our
tour of the cases exterior on the front
you have the power switch but
interestingly no reset button
moving on you have headphone and
microphone jacks and four USB 3.0 ports
which is pretty sick you will need a
pair of USB 3.0 headers on your
motherboard to get all of these ports
running at full speed but because many
motherboards only have a single USB 3.0
header they have included a USB 2.0
adapter you just won't get full speed
from that you also get a slim optical
drive if you're into that sort of thing
and a mesh grille that shows off your
power supply of all things more on that
later moving to the top there's more
venting with a filter for the three
pre-installed 120 millimeter sleeve
bearing fans you can also mount a
radiator up here as well for additional
cooling another note is that the entire
top of the case is actually removable
and unscrews and comes off which you'll
need to do when building the computer
the left side panel is just that large
piece of tempered glass that shows off
your internals since the case is quite
thin you won't be able to fit a tower
style cooler in here but some lower
profile coolers will fit in just fine
with the cases 85 millimeters of
vertical tolerance the right side panel
is held on by four thumb screws and
features a filtered fan
amount that can hold either a 120
millimeter or 140 millimeter fan just
mind your cable management if you use it
as your fan blades might get very close
to cables behind the motherboard tray
our case doesn't seem to have come with
the proper thumb screws for the glass
side panel although I'm not surprised as
this review was massively delayed and we
actually received this when it was still
a pre-production sample so I can't
really blame them for that the back has
an interesting design where your
motherboard and expansion port IO isn't
exactly flush with the outer part of the
case but is rather recessed a couple of
inches there's also more venting in for
PCI Express brackets the bottom of the
case unlike more conventional designs
that have venting of some sort for the
power supply is completely smooth now
let's have a look at the inside of the
case where things get very interesting
the PCO 6s is a micro ATX case but we
used a mini ITX motherboard for our
build since we unfortunately didn't have
any micro ATX boards on hand which is
actually part of the reason why this
video was so delayed I wanted to
hopefully get a micro ATX board but we
just still never got one anyways getting
all the parts screwed in wasn't too bad
but with Beauty often comes tight
tolerances so as an additional note
screwing some things in was easier with
a couple extra hands and doing this as a
two-person build might be genuinely
helpful I would also recommend to
install the graphics card first before
the motherboard it's a little bit
backwards but the idea is once the
motherboard is in especially with its
heatsink on it can kind of get in the
way of installing the graphics card
which is below it so if you install the
graphics card first screw it in get the
PCI riser card out of the way install
the motherboard and then plug in the
riser card everything just kind of works
speaking of the graphics card one of the
most unique things about this case is
that the graphics card is mounted
vertically so you can show it off in all
of its freakin glory it sits right near
the bottom of the case and connects to
your motherboard with a beautifully
sleeved and pre-installed PCI Express
riser cable that I previously mentioned
the effect this produces it's super
awesome especially if you really want to
make an aesthetic statement with your
case
the power supply is suspended in the
upper right portion of the case since
you can't access your power supply at
all from the outside of the case what
you have to do is instead run the power
cable through a hole on the back and
then through the back of the case and
then up to the power supply it's not a
huge deal but yeah it goes in back here
this really allows you to show off your
PSU not something that's super common
especially with basement riddled cases
these days but it also makes things a
little bit cleaner looking at the back
you also won't be able to access your
power supplies on/off switch as a note
however so just be aware of that there's
also a removable cage for your hard
drives and SSDs in the bottom right as
well as an extra bracket behind the
motherboard tray that can mount up to
three SSDs or two full-sized hard drives
literally nothing in this case except
for a few thumb screws is toolless
everything is held in with a rather
large number of screws the owners manual
even indicates the case uses no less
than eleven different types of screws
which aren't always easy to tell apart I
suggest using some magnetic parts trays
of some sort or organizational system to
keep things split up and sorted on the
flip side though this results in a very
sturdy final product when all is said
and done which I know definitely works
for some people who tend to enjoy the
experience of building a computer and
the end result instead of just rushing
through it picking up their screwdriver
a minimal amount of times this fits in
with what is as far as I can tell Leon
Lee's general philosophy of making
things strong and stable even if it
results in a longer more tedious process
the cases cable management situations
somewhat reflects this idea as well
there are quite a few cable management
holes cut out in rather sensible places
although I would have liked to seen some
like black rubber grommets in order to
make things tidy er especially as some
of the cutouts tend to be large and show
off a bit of the wiring but
theoretically with very clean wiring
this will actually look very nice and
instead of having rubber grommet little
leaflets going all over the place it's
just a nice clean pass around which is
probably
what I'm expecting they're going for
their also aren't any loops built into
the chassis on the back though lien Li
did include a few plastic adhesive 3m
loops and zip ties allowing you to use
what you need and no more than that
making it take a little bit more time
but allowing it to be more or less
perfect so fitting in with that mantra
so conclusion time this isn't the
easiest case to build in but it isn't
trying to be either if you like the
experience of building a computer
filling at home surrounded by screws
aluminum and tempered glass and want a
case to show off a relatively small
system in in a relatively legendary way
this may be the case for you as long as
your wallet is equally as legendary
tempered glass and aluminum aren't cheap
and neither is this case that three
hundred and sixty US dollars which from
a Canadian perspective is close to the
four hundred and ninety dollars ouch
Squarespace you should you should use
their 24/7 chat and email support if you
have any trouble you should try them out
for eight dollars a month and you should
get a free domain if you know you buy it
for a year which for most websites
actually does kind of make sense not all
of them but most you should use their
responsive design because that's just
modern and awesome that will look great
on any device phone tablet PC I don't
know headset maybe that's gonna be a
thing it's a point I don't know Commerce
if you need to sell something you should
use that because it just makes sense
there's like a storefront built-in cover
page if you if your mom's like you
should get a job you can like use a
cover page thing to try to apply for a
job which would be great and you should
start a trial with no credit card

Oh game but anyways going on the forum
becoming a contributor or just becoming
a member we like having people on there
it's cool now that you're done doing all
that kind of stuff you might be
wondering what to watch next so click
here this video is where I first saw the
PC o8 which is maybe possibly going to
become my case I don't really know but I
used it in the compensator build which
there will be a v2 of but Linus is
making it kind of difficult to make a
compensator build which is supposed to
be an over built computer when he just
goes around building like 8 and $9,000
no he built a 30,000 dollar computer
then he got an $8,000 chassis like dude
what am I supposed to do how am I
supposed to build like into overbuilt
compute with it's like all the videos
you make hey ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
