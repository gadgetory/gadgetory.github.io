of weeks
first AMD announced their new Radeon and
Verizon products would have released
yesterday and then Nvidia decided they
were going to announce super around the
second and well let's just say I've been
putting in some extra hours but it was
well worth it the new Radeon rx 5700
series is nearly as interesting as the
new third gen rise of processors a ridge
wallet is a sleek way to keep wallet
bulge down thanks to its compact frame
and RFID blocking inner plates use the
offer code in the video description to
save 10% on your Ridge wallet and get
free worldwide shipping
first the cards themselves we've got
three SKUs available at launch the
mid-range rx 5700 is positioned to
compete directly against team greens our
TX 2060 while the higher-end rx 5700 XT
with four extra compute units was being
pitted against the RT X 2070 but now
that card is out of the picture so the
real rival there ends up being the RT X
2060 super finally there is a limited
edition 50th anniversary rx 5700 XT with
a gold-trimmed shroud and an 80
megahertz clock boost for an extra $50 a
personally I'd buy an extra game but
everyone has different priorities
powering the rx 5700 series is a new 7
nanometre core design AMD is calling our
DNA compared to the previous generation
GCN based cards like Vega our DNA
features native PCI Express 4.0 support
along with G DDR 6 is standard not HB m2
as a result of the latter point
availability should improve over Vega
and the financial breakeven point for
AMD should be far lower giving them more
mobility in terms of pricing an
important point we'll get to later on
for now I want to nerd out a little bit
the new compute units are core to the
performance and efficiency gains AMD
claims with the RX 5700 series and
ultimately may be a point of contention
for AMD fans because of what it implies
about the AMD fine wine technology see a
GPU typically does its work in batches
to make a long story short
each of AMD's older GCN compute units
can work on up to four batches at a time
and wouldn't you know it
each batch is sized to be evenly
divisible by four thanks to the magic of
parallel processing that means it can
complete one batch per cycle
if 4qs are active simultaneously which
is where AMD's traditional strength and
compute comes from the problem with this
approach comes about when there's fewer
than four batches to work on
simultaneously which frequently occurs
in games as processing the band's rise
and fall depending on what's on the
screen so if you end up having one batch
getting process at a time it can take up
to four times longer to complete than it
otherwise would and even worse it's not
because the GPU is overworked
but rather because there's so much of
its sitting idle optimizing games and
drivers to help prevent this is somewhat
complex and also where many of those
fine wine improvements come from our DNA
compute units on the other hand use two
queues each capable of handling batches
at twice the rate of GCN in a single
cycle which means each compute unit in
the new architecture can handle the same
amount of work as before but with only
half the potential for performance loss
in an optimized scenario all while being
easier optimized for AMD capitalized on
this new design by combining it with a
few other tweaks that help smooth out
the rough edges which altogether makes
for a far more streamlined and optimized
rendering engine for games with the
obvious downside for AMD fans being that
fine wine as we know it and may be a
thing of the past along with the
hardware AMD is launching a host of new
features some of which are novel and
while others are well let's get into it
radians multimedia capabilities got a
substantial boost this generation with
support for the new visually lossless
display stream compression technique
that enables the new cards to output up
to 8k 60 off of a single connector with
no chroma subsampling that's pretty sick
a less cool sick and more sick is the
new Radeon media engine that combines
encoding and decoding into one place on
paper you've got the ingredients for a
really versatile card but our test
recordings were disappointing at the
same CPU usage and bitrate and vank
completely wipes the floor with it with
many of the smaller details of our
recording just completely getting lost
on AMD ouch perhaps the most interesting
of the new features is what AMD is
calling anti-lag it's a little difficult
to explain exactly the TLDR is that you
can think of it kind of like a vsync for
your CPU but unlike vsync it actually
lowers input lag it achieves this by
having the CPU only tell the GPU to work
on frames as soon as they're needed
meaning that while frame rates might
drop by a few percentage points with it
on the time taken to display each frame
and thus the input lag is reduced Linus
has caught the high-speed camera bugs so
let us
though in the comments if you want to
see this put to the test and I'll pass
the feedback along I'm sure he'll be
down for any excuse to play with the
fandom again finally there's the feature
that's interesting for all the wrong
reasons the new open source fidelity FX
framework you can think of this a bit
like graphics tweaking packages like re
shade or sweet effects but virtually for
free
contrast adaptive sharpening is what AMD
chose to show off for now and really I
could take or leave it some things look
decent like the road and motion example
at f1 2019 but others look really tacky
like their Borderlands example the good
news is that it comes without a
performance penalties so if you do like
it you can toggle it on for all DX 912
and vulcan titles via the Radeon image
sharpening feature bringing us finally
to benchmarks since I've been on such a
time crunch for this release I'm reusing
the GPU bench I built up for the Nvidia
super video which thankfully means I can
also reuse some of those numbers that's
the one benefit the product launches
this close together there's no time for
driver updates hamdi's off to a good
start in gaming though the RX 5700
performance has it competing well
against even the RT X 2060 super and at
times it's bigger brother rx 5700 XT
overtakes even the far more expensive RT
X 2070 super titles with hair works like
Metro Exodus gave us lower performance
on Radeon but the new lineup still
remained competitive against its direct
competitors typically sitting above
their overall performance levels not a
great look for Nvidia right now
considering super was supposed to be a
giant middle finger to AMD as for
productivity AMD is still strong but a
bit more of a mixed bag than usual for
instance for longer renders in blender
both new cards beat out the RT X 2070
but then in shorter ones both of them
lost even to the non super RT X 2060 we
thought that was pretty weird SOI to
interrupt future Anthony here you might
have noticed something strange about
this blender result look at the 2070
super
way out of line well I reran at a bunch
of times on all the cards and even
though the 2070 super isn't that far
ahead of the 2017 other tests here we
are still investigating this one okay on
to the video then Lux Marquez team red
and team green trading blows again
depending on the workload that both AMD
cards steal the show in CATIA and
SolidWorks even from the RT X 2070 super
and as for the rest of spec view perf
we've got another mishmash of wins and
losses for team red and team green with
the deltas being high enough that
depending on your workload you might opt
for one over the other one last bit of
performance testing PCI Express 4.0 we
weren't expecting much in terms of
performance uplift here and that's
exactly what we got at least with these
workloads I mean some games see a couple
of extra frames and these spec view perf
numbers are a little bit higher but
that's about it
as for thermals well the good news is it
could be worse but the bad news is that
it's only true because it hasn't caught
fire yet the RX 5700 seems fine but it
looks like there are some early teething
issues with the RX 5700 XT that caused
our unit to boost itself into oblivion
and overheat eventually shutting down
under certain conditions like sitting in
a game menu for too long these kinds of
lapses in QA testing are exactly why we
get upset when manufacturers like AMD
rush things to market rather than
waiting until they're fully cooked
pardon the pun light us maybe say that
anyway assuming they can squish this bug
and tame the beast the value proposition
is an interesting one on the one hand
and videos RTX 2017 on super is probably
going to be a pretty good deal in the
near future as stores get rid of stock
to make room for a super but the RT x
2060 super being a slower card plays
into AMD's hand here they targeted their
rx 5700 XT at the 2070 and it's now
priced like a 2060 super it may not win
on all fronts and if Nvidia's
objectively better software and features
sweet mean nothing to you then the RX
5700 series often manages superior
performance per dollar in gaming
and for productivity it trades blows
enough that it'll be worth it for many
especially Linux and Apple users who
enjoy superior driver support from AMD
so early adopter issues aside it's not
the groundbreaking industry Shaker upper
that rise in 3rd gen is where AMD
dismantled intel's entire consumer
product lineup but it's worth buying and
which is honestly more than we expected
given how much of AMD's GPU division has
defected to Intel in the last couple of
quarters one thing that concerns us
though is where do they go from here
it's tough to see how AMD will release a
higher-end card with this architecture
without resorting to liquid cooling and
5 nanometers is unlikely to tame the
inferno
but today's a happy day let's deal with
that problem tomorrow and today can be
your happy day thanks to mass drop and
the Sennheiser PC 37 X gaming headset
it's open back design gives you a wide
stereo image from drivers that come from
the venerable HD 598 and HD 600
headphones you'll get clearer audio for
gaming and music and for comms you get a
noise cancelling microphone optimized to
handle unpleasant pops and hisses that
automatically mutes when you've rotated
out of the way best of all its ten-foot
braided cable is strong enough and long
enough to reach around even the most
elaborate gaming setup buy it today from

some of the stuff we featured in the
video description maybe not the 5700 XT
right now but the 5,700 should be fine
