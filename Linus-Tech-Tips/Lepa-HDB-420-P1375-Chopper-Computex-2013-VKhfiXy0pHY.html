2013 is powered by western digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys i'm here at the
lipa booth i was sent over here by
enermax because they told me there was a
few things that I had to see first we're
going to start off with their 240
millimeter liquid cooler this apparently
has TDP support for 300 watts it's an
aio cooler as you can see it looks very
sharp it looks very ah like rough and
nice cut edges it would look great with
a ROG board due to the red and heavy
blacks that go with it other than that
they're using their own leap of fans and
it looks it just looks generally good i
really really like how this looks it can
go with a lot of more aggressive black
and red colored themes and other than
that it is fairly standard so we're
going to move on to the big guy over
here this power supply caught me off
guard immediately because down here we
got a 1600 1600 watt power supply which
is insane I don't know anyone that would
actually need that but I'm sure they're
out there somewhere and then up here
it's not out yet but a 1700 wat
compatible power supply you will need a
special connector for this but it exists
which is crazy it's all modular as you
can hopefully see here in a second all
modular cable so you can plug everything
in there you want I would hope that you
can pull you everything in there you
want considering it can go up to 1,700
watts so you're probably going to have
an insane amount of stuff hopefully I
can put this up here without breaking
anything because I do not want to try
and afford a seventeen hundred watt
power supply it has a durable ball
bearing fan Japanese caps and does
everything else that you would need to
be able to hit something like 17 hundred
watts you're running Platinum
certification on that one and gold
certification down here now I'm going to
try and get cameraman to walk through
the booth to the other side all the way
over sorry b-roll I'm sure this is crazy
we got a guy's diving for chairs that he
doesn't fall over thank you for that and
we're going to cover their fans if you
biro can get around that chair their
fans you might recognize are very
similar if you've seen our enermax
coverage because they are partnered so
they have things like different lighting
modes that we saw at enter max and
they're actually very similar overall
but they do look different you can get
quite a different quite a bit of
different styles with lipa that we
didn't have
enermax so if you're looking for
different colored look things if you're
looking for different shapes we're
looking for awesome aggressive black and
red looking coolers or if you're looking
for all the power you could ever need
you might want to check out lipa to see
