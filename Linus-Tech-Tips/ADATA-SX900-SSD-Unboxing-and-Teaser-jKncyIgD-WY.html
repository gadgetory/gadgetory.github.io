cube case is great for air cooling or
liquid cooling check the link in the
video description to learn more welcome
to an unboxing that's actually more of a
teaser for some upcoming content that we
have planned this is the ADATA
SX 900 two and a half inch SATA 3 six
gigabit per second solid-state drive it
has NCQ smart command queuing compatible
with SATA 3 gigabit per second it is
optimized for a HDI mode and it will run
in raid which has something to do with
this to do more on that in a moment ok
back to this back to this ok san force
driven so it uses a sand force
controller so that means it is very
optimized for client type workloads
where you a lot of the data that you
work with on a day to day basis is going
to be compressible as opposed to non
compressible so it uses advanced
algorithms in the SSD itself in order to
not only make it operate faster than the
controller are faster than the NAND
flash itself could operate if it was
just writing to it on its own but it
also increases the lifetime of it
because it actually commits fewer rights
to the NAND so remember every SSD has a
built in maximum overall lifecycle that
it will eventually wear out in and Sam
force drives particularly if you work
with a lot of compressible data will
last longer than another equally built
SSD shock-resistant just like all SSDs
supports trimming comes with a Cronus
true mid HD which is actually one of the
better one of the better cloning
applications out there that we've used
as far as included ones with SSDs go so
kudos to a data for using that alright
accessories it includes a spacer because
it uses a 7 millimeter form factor so if
you have a laptop that's only compatible
of nine and a half mil you can go ahead
and install that spacer on there it
includes a three and a half inch desktop
adapter with a data branding on it it
also has like kind of some texture on it
so maybe it's you know reinforced or
something there you go so that'll make
it compatible of your desktop and it has
a beautiful brushed black finish on it
actually really like that it looks very
striking so there's a say there three
six gigabit per second interface on the
back and it is made in Taiwan and
apparently someone gets a anachronistic
Truman HD key good job you get that now
so what are we going to be doing what
why do we need four of them we are going
to be doing a test on the z87 platform
where we take these SSDs and run one two
and this is where the maximum would have
been before on z77 because there were
only two Intel native SATA 3 6 gigabit
per second ports so we're going to try 1
2 3 and 4 drives in raid 0 to see where
the benefit actually tapers off in terms
of how many drives you can keep adding
to a raid 0 before you run into a
bottleneck that is between the actual
SATA chipset itself and the rest of the
system whereas because I mean remember
you can have as many SATA 3 six gigabit
per second ports as you want but if
you're actually flooding them all with
data at the same time then there might
be another internal bottleneck somewhere
else on the board so we're gonna find
out when we reach that limit and we'll
also be using them to do a raid 0 setup
guide which is really simple but hey
it's helpful to have video guides for
pretty much anything I'd like following
along with them thank you for checking
out this unboxing and teaser don't
forget to subscribe to Lions tech tips
for more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos don't forget to like
this video if you like what we're gonna
be doing with these drives and don't
forget to leave a comment if you have
any other suggestions for what we could
do with for 256 gig SSDs that's actually
something else that's unique about these
drives is they don't over provision as
much normally you'd find a 240 gig
SandForce drive and these are the full
256 so you do have to use a higher
quality and if you don't want to over
provision as much and remember guys that
over-provisioning is something that you
can do manually simply by creating a 240
gig partition on this drive so it gives
you the flexibility to short-stroke it
or over-provision it yourself if you
want to or use the hole capacity if you
do prefer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
