look I'll remember the first time I had
a mouthful of Brussels sprouts it was
March 11th 2019 the time 10:20 a.m. we
had all gathered upstairs to attend our
usual weekly meeting talking about past
and upcoming events looking at memes the
usual stuff but this was not to be just
any ordinary meeting was petrified the
mere thought of having to delay my daily
broadcast to indulge this undue
displacement at my heart pumping no one
person or object would be left untouched
by what was about to transpire not even
grandmaster left for any a bike ride
Linus Linus but he could give no
attention to my sorrow linus media group
would never be the same again but first
a word from our sponsor thermal takes a
500 features a modern minimalist design
with brushed aluminum panels and dual
hinge swing tempered glass doors check
it out today at the link below
having already displaced myself from the
tepid editing den I decided I could
stand as witness to the ordeal somewhat
it didn't take long for Linus to lose
control why are we making a pile of bean
bags here that Jake had been planning
for this all along the voluptuous bean
bags were his first target their color
palette would surely make for an
excellent throne
all hail Jake media group I knew this
was coming but I didn't expect it would
actually happen amidst all of the
mockery chaos and confusion little
explanation was forthcoming we knew we
had to do it and like good soldiers we
acted on orders but not knowing why so I
realized I haven't actually explained
why we're doing this with the new hiring
wave we're gonna be adding a couple more
people to the writing team so we were
out of space over on that side for
writers and rather than split the
writing team we figured the writing team
will take the bigger space and then the
salespeople and administrative people
will go over there some of us were at
the brink of insanity
you wanna take 20 home Anthony who needs
a bed who needs a couch
although certain good insulators - you
can replace your fringe but I'm just
like put a couple ice packs in with your
food I'm literally taking it off others
became compassionate today I'm down so
am i kicking about where does that go
for a minute you know what you get 24
hours notice
Linus struggled to find meaning in it
all why are things just moving this is
the Luminess fine James where are you
going because I know you were making
comments about staking out boy that's
location I said you had to confirm where
you were going hey I'm just listening to
Jake you know what I don't know just ask
Jake it was every man for himself these
bean bags just get rid of Colton if you
guys love you you know I think
everyone's all fired up since the last
time we did a vlog you know everyone's
ready you know to to conquer the day I
wasn't the only one concerned with the
state of our real estate no one cared to
really win at all except me I was like
look I don't want to be by the door I
don't want to do by the bathroom don't
even really kitchen
that leaves one logical spot the spot
that Jake is now in and Jake's one who
assigned the spots yes correct myself
rise up at this rate it wouldn't be long
before Jake's reign would come crashing
down as I became more and more
distraught I decided to take on discount
what is this J I think it's some obscure
t-shirt Lord it could have been worse
King Jake had decided that the cubicles
had to go shelter anyone could just come
and talk to me at any time
very annoy the only people you'll make
random eye contact with is the spectral
beings in that window when the light is
dim being the good person that I am I
offered assistance in the cleanup of my
now wall free dwelling as matter who has
no stake in the upstairs how do you feel
about this move
how are you feeling good about this move
entirely Jake's plan you know do you
think the people who'd had noticed is
you're making some rise up and for state
to get the worst spot oh yes okay I like
that idea
hey James do you want to have to get the
worst fuck I think riders should rise up
are you gonna help you just stand there
it wouldn't be long before James
belligerent behavior would come to cost
him his social status now sad recluse he
still has not come out of his office I
lied it was then that I discovered
Tyler's true nature
what are you helping out with right now
a Prime's new role didn't seem to be
fitting him very well I don't know for
Linus the challenge would be amazing
okay I'm gonna start with the vocal
recording booth but not everyone was
feeling the pressure no one's prepared
the labeling process is working as
intended tools that are going upstairs
later which is stored upstairs
Colton couldn't stop rationalizing his
distaste with the very idea of dwelling
with his partner I was like okay maybe
we need to move the desk that room and
he's like normally put it in the same
room I just said I'm sorry no he's gone
oh then he left the table and the
monitor for me to clean up whatever
would it do all right what's up I didn't
do it last week we were we were saying
it could be an ongoing thing just have
to work it out you know and then he
broke up with me
okay it became clear that there were
gaps in Jakes leadership Johnson
accomplice
boxes did they you tried to be a god
does it feel good to have the power
everyone blaming yeah his meeting done
Luke was finally ready to join in on the
chaos meanwhile Dennis was busy taking
the mineral oil PC for a walk Oh Dennis
it's around that time that Linus came to
realize that his fabulous desk was
trouble there's a certain advantage to
have modularity the pain was crippling
he had never asked for this the
Nostalgia DVDs what is this 2002 what is
this
thankfully the mood was lightening up
what I really want is this man I think
if I do that trick or you go really fast
like and yeah yeah I can get it yeah
three two one you see that we are never
gonna do it we weren't gonna do that
double fisting Oh
every single time that we use just tap
water and building people get super mad
so we've just had this one like bottle
of UK cryo fuel and we just fill it up
with tap water and then pour it in don't
like get super mad at us every time holy
I didn't believe that Wow magic man this
is how you live with proper form okay we
call these good mornings Oh
we began assembling shelves that would
neatly divide the space to serve as
ideological barriers between the writers
to get this reference a computer and a
car thanks mom and dad
bro I don't know what's this stupid
references you make meanwhile the
glittery filing apparatus was being
relocated to its new dwelling look that
glitter go
ah are you excited to have some daylight
in your office it wasn't without fault
well I think was already like that no
refunds
oh now thankfully Nick has experience
breaking into people's homes so he came
up with a solution that also happened to
mend our fancy to fix everything the
aftermath of moving a glitter covered
file cabinet this video brought to you
by
not actually but hey
now I realize that watching people move
and assemble furniture is probably not
the most exhilarating use of your time
but you've stuck with us this far so
bear with me here hi I think I went too
fast okay what can I do
family huh we're just grabbing Colton's
nuts geez I started at a really low
point and now you get your own office
what did your friends like Dennis and
Taryn Etzel John and question mark
they're your friends now question we're
gonna keep you company and your new up
no no no no this is yours I don't want
to take this away I can't be my own
friend
this base is finally coming together all
right there you go thank you
thanks man heck yeah there's room for
another writer right here in a swiveling
chair you just get a key mouse mounted
to the chair and a monitor that comes
out from your crotch and you just do
your best work
actually I'm gonna miss it
surprisingly it's so cheerful how are
you gonna remember to live love and
laugh
it's a shame Nick won't fully embrace
the glory of his space try to forgot my
plan right now
well you already succeeded in taking an
end I didn't mean to he literally was
like like he saw he came in and saw this
layout he's like no I better grab this
stuff and leave
sounds like Colton is still dwelling on
the past move on Colton protection well
I guess it's time to pretend that this
video made any sense at all and with
that here's Linus alright so for better
for worse we're kind of done I decided
this is where my desk is going and my
bench is gonna go over here and I'm
gonna figure out how all broke the
networking cable along there something I
don't know I'll figure it up anyway
Riley's over here
he's requisitioned three bean bags for
his own personal use exhale sighs this
is this is exactly where you were before
Anthony now has more dust face than ever
before
sort of all of the shelves moving from
downstairs and are now up here I have no
idea what the plan is for this desk and
then you can always tell who was the
coordinator for a move because for
whatever reason jake has two desks two
shelves James also has a shelf of plant
no no it's a plant of Alex's plan boom
and then Alex also has a - gasps of it
everyone ended up with more space I
guess that's good
you want the windows washed yeah go for
it over here we've got Lloyd's desk
you've got the plugins here on video
solves difficult actives like there's
desk here which is like really stupid
honestly no still in here head was still
in here and then he moved out I don't
want to move it you have to get into
your chair sideways yeah and then turn
it okay here's the deal here's what's
actually happening though the couch is
gonna go right there everybody's gonna
be able to put their head against the
electrical panel here
using the TV mounted on that wall we're
gonna do the surround sound system up
