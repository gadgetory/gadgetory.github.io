announced geforce jia cyst a USB stick
that would enable a suite of features
called geforce assisted gaming so ghost
play would use AI to analyze your
gameplay style then if you have to get
up to get the door or something it will
just keep playing as though it was you
me boss boost could analyze boss fights
and help you with the most effective way
to beat them you could use it one time
per session and envy nurture would even
tell you when to eat and drink to stay
nourished and hydrated even going as far
as to tell you when the drinks in your
fridge were chilled obviously of course
that was an April Fool's joke but after
much clamoring from the community Nvidia
did actually produce a GeForce GTX
styled USB Drive in the same kind of
form as the G assist so it looks just
like a little miniature GTX Canadian
that and durable so Nvidia produce only
1080 of moment I see what you did there
because 4k gaming right and they sent us
two of them so naturally our first
question was can they run Crysis the
answer of course was no that's stupid
they're USB drives they're 64 gig
thumbsticks our second question then was
can we run them in SLI let's find out
cooller masters 25th anniversary edition
cosmos 2 features a unique dual curved
tempered glass side panel check it out
now at the link below but how do we run
SLI obviously there's no you know SLI
enable button and in videos control
panel for a gag limited run product so
we got to thinking well raid then would
be the closest thing to running multiple
storage devices together for increased
performance but this raises other
questions how do we do that hardware
RAID cards are the best raid experience
but as you can probably imagine nobody
really makes a hardware RAID card these
are like 500 plus taller devices for
putting thumb drives in them so know
we're going to have to go back to our
good old friend software raid something
we've actually used several times in the
past including on our ill-fated raid 50
solid state 1x server so for our first
attempt then things are going to be
pretty simple we go ahead and plug in
both drives they're both formatted right
out of the box we open up the disk
management software that's included with
Windows look at that they're both
detected and then mmm
stumbling block what should come up when
we right-click on the drive is the
option to convert them to dynamic discs
they need to be dynamic disks in order
for us to run software raid I mean to be
clear I'm not complaining that Windows
doesn't allow you to run a raid on
removable USB devices that a terrible
terrible idea but that doesn't change
the fact that I want to do it so
fortunately we found some unverified
instructions on the internet that should
allow us to load a really ancient 64 bit
USB Drive driver and hopefully get our
raid 0 game on so the first step is that
we need to disable
a cure boot including unloading the PK
keys then well we tried installing the
old unsigned USB driver to trick the
system but that failed with an error
about driver signing so by shift
rebooting then disabling driver
signature in the advanced startup
options we can force the driver to
install using device manager once that
happened both drives were detected as
normal internal drives rather than USB
drives and the striped array option
becomes available for us to know come on
surely my random thing I found on the
internet with a random driver from 2006
should have worked but it didn't well
desperate times call for desperate
measures I took to googling it and found
this video from the 8-bit guy whose
channel intro says the ibooks got hold
on a minute
oh no you can't do it on the pc but you
can do it on a Mac here goes then we got
our 2017 MacBook Pro and we are going to
do this because I'm determined to run
SLI USB drives even if I have to do it
on a MacBook oh all right
I'm a little rusty on my Mac operation I
actually haven't touched this thing
since since I did my review of it right
nothing on a Mac is done by
right-clicking right raid assistant
striped raid zero that's what we want no
way is it this easy is it going to work
ok SLI raid
hey this looks promising no it works GTX
SLI raid no friggin way
okay so let's fire up black magic disk
speed test change our target and bam
have a look at what these write speeds
look like baby okay ah there you go
they're not the fastest drives in the
world but a hundred and fourteen
megabytes per second on our sli raid is
actually faster than the 72 megabytes
per second that we got on a single Drive
so does SLI work on the geforce gtx via
fist limited edition USB 1080 drive not
a real product thing the answer is sort
of you've probably heard that you should
use a VPN when you're browsing the
internet if you want your data to be
secure and you want to be able to access
things that would otherwise be
restricted but you've also probably
heard oh it's complicated you heard
wrong tunnel bear is so simple you just
pick what country you want to tunnel
through and press the button it's
available on iOS Android PC and Mac they
even have a Chrome extension and they've
got a top rated privacy policy and they
do not log your activity so whether you
want to watch programming that's not
available in your region or whether you
just don't want your internet service
provider knowing what sites you're
visiting and what your downloading
tunnel Bears got you covered you can try
it for free with five hundred megabytes
and no credit card required then when
you get a year of unlimited make sure
you go to tunnel ver comm /l tt so you
can save 10% so thanks for watching guys
if you just like this video then you
clearly don't enjoy fun but if you liked
it hit the like button get subscribed
maybe cuz
they're checking out where to buy the
steps we've featured okay you can't buy
these but you can buy a real one at the
link in the video description also down
there is our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
