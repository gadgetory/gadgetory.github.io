mail this is from ocz it's uh directly
from their their offices in Taiwan so I
actually opened it already so i'm
actually just showing you the already
opened box packaging so in here they had
some limited edition mesh heat sinks as
well as some ddr3 2000 c9 ram so i'm
actually going to show you i had this
sort of specially specially shipped so
first of all I want to unveil Oh Susie's
limited edition sapphire blue and black
heat spreaders so this is how they come
packed if they do not ship on a memory
module so you can see they have a
plastic covering on them I'm going to go
ahead and try to remove there you go and
that is just a beautiful ram spreader
you can see it has a an iridescent
finish to it and from depending on the
angle it catches the light kind of nice
ok so those are the are their limited
edition sapphire blue XTC ram spreaders
which I specially requested some
separate spreaders for and then I have
some ram here that I'm going to be I can
ever get this back in the baggie then I
will keep talking
about other things other than the RAM
spreader okay so there that's how they
come packed two per slot okay and then
the other thing that came in this
package was some mmm-hmm so these are
elpida aid I cl9 modules these are four
gig modules so once I actually put the
heat spreaders on myself which is what
I'll have to do this will be a 24 gig
triple channel memory kit suitable for
installation and an x58 motherboard so
we'll be having a look at 24 gig
configuration and as I said before these
are ddr3 2000 megahertz four gig modules
direct from ocz this is a very cool
thing to be unboxing but unfortunately I
don't think you can actually buy one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
