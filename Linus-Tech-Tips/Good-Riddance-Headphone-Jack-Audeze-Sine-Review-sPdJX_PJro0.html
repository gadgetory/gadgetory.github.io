revolution an audio revolution well more
of a controversy really so in light then
of the rumors about Apple's abandonment
of the de facto standard three and a
half millimeter audio jack in favor of
their proprietary reversible USB
implementation here is my review of The
Odyssey sign one of the first lightening
headphones on the market and woven into
my thoughts on this product are going to
be my thoughts on the shift towards
lightening and I guess USB type-c for
that matter as an audio jack because in
some ways the advantages and drawbacks
of this product will be a look into the
future of mobile audio in general
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to Tritonal
bear for free check out the link in the
video description alright so if you've
seen a pair of headphones before you've
seen something that's functionally you
know pretty much like this but probably
with less BMW design works influenced
those guys really get around hey not
that I'm criticizing BMW group's
offshoot industrial design and
consultancy houses efforts here the
signs are a rare audiophile headset that
just oozes style starting from the top
the shiny stitched natural leather
headband contrasts wonderfully with the
matte aluminum end caps that has the
smooth stepless frictional size
adjustment mechanism I wish it had a bit
more padding but since the strong
clamping pressure of the ear cups is
most of what keeps it on your head I
won't take off any marks here on that
subject though the same mix of leather
and aluminum is present in the ear cups
and makes the signs a little heavier
than your typical out and about on your
headphone like the Sennheiser momentum
on-ear but thanks to the way the load is
distributed I never felt like they were
at risk of falling off with that said
the clamping force out of the box is
stronger than I'd like causing my ears
to get sore after about an hour of
listening even with my earrings removed
okay then the next big question is is it
worth it then for these shockingly
compact planar magnetic cans this is a
technology that sacrifices some weight
design complexity and sometimes trouble
performance to deliver a sound with
minimal distortion and rich smooth
accurate bass and that only a few short
years ago was basically only found
inexpensive difficult to power products
or from obscure brands like well Odyssey
though I guess the way that they've
stormed into a mainstream is a testament
to what they've done with the technology
that was introduced to North America by
Yamaha back in the 70s then basically
faded into obscurity
the short answer then
is maybe after some break in the ear
pressure was much more tolerable for me
although I still don't prefer on your
headphones and the signs sound great
they don't isolate ambient noise
particularly well but the image
astonishingly well and sound very
natural for a closed back design it's
safe to say these are the best on ears
I've ever heard and in my opinion this
is how do I describe it it's a beat
generation sound done right listening to
my usual mix of trashy popular songs on
Apple music the impressions I came away
with are that the highs are detailed
enough without being fatiguing to listen
to a common complaint for me personally
with audiophile grade headphones and
bass performances fantastic as long as
you don't mind the somewhat heavy-handed
approach it's tight dynamic and just a
blast to listen to but without doing
anything to obscure the crystal clear
mids that let vocalists guitar solos and
the like really pop but why do they
sound good is it the planar magnetic
drivers or is it the fancy lightning
connector at the other end let's talk
about the cypher cable because on some
of the more mainstream sites and blogs
that I've read there seems to be some
confusion about it
for starters while it's true that you
cannot playback 24-bit 96k low Hertz HD
audio files which Apple is allegedly
planning to make available shortly on
iTunes out of the headphone jack on your
iPhone today the mini stereo connector
itself has nothing to do with that
limitation it actually has to do with
the audio processing electronics the DAC
or digital to analog converter the DSP
or digital sound processor and to a
lesser degree the amplifier that are
inside the iPhone that is what's not
able to process files encoded in this
manner something that isn't actually the
case even with other competing
smartphones so sorry there's no such
thing as digital headphones and the
converter
to an analogue signal is still taking
place it's just doing so at a later
stage in the chain with more advanced
hardware than Apple pre-installed in
their phone so the bump right here that
contains the microphone and the inline
controls is what's so special about the
cable because it has all of that
hardware so then the advantages to this
approach are as follows
one removing the jack save some space
inside the chassis of the phone this
image from iFixit shows you about how
much - isolating audio gear from
processors and wireless antennas is
widely regarded as a good thing 3
functionality like volume control track
skipping etc can work more consistently
or even be enhanced in the future
leading to number 4 the ability to
update the firmware or store settings
within your headphones themselves
something that we're already seeing with
the cypher including the ability to set
EQ settings with their app 5 being able
to power your headphones off the phone
could mean RGB lighting active noise
cancellation or other features without
the need for batteries and 6 back to
where we started the ability to bypass
Apple's decidedly mediocre audio
implementation in favor of something
that's hopefully better but all of this
comes with some disadvantages - number
one headphones with this functionality
will be more complex to design and
manufacture which contributes directly
to the price you can expect to find on
the sticker - the lightning cable
combined with the circuitry for audio
processing will make the cable and/or
the headphone itself bulkier and heavier
3 and this is such a killer for me you
will require an adapter Apple is rumored
to be providing one in the box if you
just want to use your onboard audio and
for well you will require a separate
likely more expensive adapter if you
want to charge your iPhone and use your
lightning headphones at the same time a
common occurrence for mobile gamers I
think this commenter on
five Mac probably put it better than I
ever could because what this really
boils down to for me while I understand
the desire to eliminate a potential
opening for water dirt and Pocket lint
unless Apple and other manufacturers for
this matter because type C audio is
functionally similar though it's a bit
more of a quagmire in terms of the spec
unless Apple uses this opportunity to
introduce industry-leading
water resistance to their products or
anything else that people are actually
asking them for they'll have sacrificed
functionality for perceived elegance yet
again just like with the 2013 Mac Pro
and the 2015 MacBook whose diminutive
size and few ugly ports look beautiful
until you have to attach an octopus of
adapters just to plug in the you need to
get anything done back to the conclusion
for the signed headphones though with
the cipher lightning cable and some EQ
fine tuning I'm confident anyone would
love their sound and quite frankly they
sound pretty damn good even without it
even better with a higher quality source
file and better upstream gear this is a
very solid product as long as your ears
tolerate on your headphones a little
better than mine do speaking of solid
products ifixit.com is not a product
it's a website but they sell products so
to go along with their 19000
step-by-step repair guides they have a
huge inventory of replacement parts as
well as tools with lifetime warranties
on them so that you can repair your
stuff instead of junking it and
replacing it or paying someone often as
much as it would have cost to get all
the parts and tools that you needed in
order to do it for you the big one that
we're featuring today is the pro Tech
tool kit which includes the new 64 bit
driver kit which has 10 more bits than
the former 54 bit driver kit as well as
their magnetic casing their newly
designed little top precision driver
their precision ESD safe tweezers their
wider variety of plastic opening tools
and picks their suction cup for display
removal
they're ESD safety strap to make sure
you don't destroy your stuff with static
shock while you're working on it and the
best part of it is that it's only sixty
nine ninety five and what's even better
than that is you guys can save five
bucks on any purchase of $10 or more
over at ifixit.com slash Linus
