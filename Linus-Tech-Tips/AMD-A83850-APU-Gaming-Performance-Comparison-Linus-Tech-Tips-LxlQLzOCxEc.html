the highest-performing of the highest
performing the most extreme of the extra
nom okay and actually this video is
going to be all about onboard graphics
because AMD has just released their new
830 850 as well as their a 630 something
something well anyway that a 38 50 is
the one that I'm having a look at is
their new apu and AMD claims has onboard
discreet level DirectX 11 graphics so
we're going to take that and we're going
to put it to the test against Intel's
Core i3 2105 so this uses Intel HD 3000
graphics which is the higher end of the
graphics on the Sandy Bridge processors
so this has the same limbered graphics
as the 2600 K in the 2500 K but it is a
dual core lower end chip that actually
is priced similarly to the a 38 50 now
for a third point of comparison I'm also
going to be taking our Radeon 66 70 and
I'm going to be plugging it in in dual
graphics mode this is the wrong
motherboard but it's around here
somewhere in dual graphics mode with the
a8 3850 to see how much of a performance
boost we can get by adding a discreet
card in dual graphics mode which used to
be called hybrid crossfire so I'm going
to be running at 1280 by 720 with a
variety of games the first one is dirt3
if you come in and have a closer look
you'll probably see that it looks like
crap because it's running at 720p with
everything set to low but the reality of
it is I want to get a reproducible
results where I can actually show
scaling between all of these different
graphics solutions so I have to I have
to have something reasonably playable or
especially on games where I actually
have to play through it's going to be
very difficult to do consistent
benchmarking runs so stay tuned for more
and I'll be showing you these free
solutions up against each other who pood
Battlefield Bad Company 2 the game that
looks like it was released like check to
check out check that out check out that
aliasing looks like it was released like
eight years ago when you play it on
onboard graphics say here's my fellow
character
such crappy textures but that's what I
have to do to benchmark on board so here
we go for Crysis 2 ironically the lowest
graphics setting is high because they
subscribe to the good better best even
better than that system of doing things
obviously DirectX 11 is off with the
core i3 2105 because it does not support
DirectX 11 so here we go Crysis 2 is the
next in my list of oh I haven't even
written it down yet Crysis 2 games to
benchmark okay my benchmark runs
finished in Crysis 2 but I just wanted
to show you guys how utterly rubbish it
looks with onboard graphics so here I'll
zoom in as far as I can so you guys can
kind of see what I'm talking about here
there's basically no substantiality to
any textures at all you see that
blurriness that's not for my camera
that's just from like ah being zoomed in
but like you just you can't make out
anything it's kind of terribad like look
at look at these sandbags it just looks
like big white blobs and performance is
negated for the witcher 2 i will be
using the lowest presets once again at
1280 by 720 which is technically HD but
by the time you set everything to low
and are running on a 1080p screen so
you're dealing with interpolation 720p
doesn't look very HD at all we'll see
how it goes here's the results so far
with the i3 2105 that's 20.0 not 200
under Crysis 2 by the way which or two
runs pretty Kara bad on the 2105 as well
it actually doesn't look bad through the
camera but I assure you it's not good
combat in particular is a pretty choppy
you can see the frame rate up there
that's been a while since I've run mafia
2 as a benchmark so here's the settings
I'm using all low 720p good stuff and
then I'm just going to use the oh I
gotta restart the game Here I am in the
middle of benchmarking my cat wants me
Froese toy forum so I will this is this
toy now he'll go get it sometimes he
brings it back
sometimes you knocks it down the stairs
it chases it on is up here's the big
finale in the Mafia to benchmark where's
this plosion oh I'm right I missed it
okay well there you go there's the
results it's been a while since I've
been to a cops but I figure it's
appropriate fairly mainstream game this
is a very mainstream sort of platform on
board graphics all that stuff check out
this guy's shirt yeah yeah we're not
even getting like fantastic frame rates
even so but yeah we'll see how it
compares to the APU Nordica so here I'm
configurate being configurating
configuring the integrated graphics
forcing multi monitor I'm setting
everything at the highest I've got 8
gigs of system memory so I have no
problem with 2 gigs on the frame buffer
so let's see how this goes so now that
I'm in Windows with my 6670 I can see
that crossfire is enabled with the APU
if I go into the hardware you can see
I've got my 65 50 D my hyper memory I
got my where to go 6550 D linked adaptor
built by now ok
that's funny it's at 66 70 just a minute
ago components
display 6600 series there we go okay
good enough so let's run some games now
I want to take a short break in my
testing to show you guys something this
is the Aspen canned benchmark for dirt
three I'm running it on the 66 966 70
with the APU running in CrossFireX mode
now check out these frame rates so I'll
wait until the race is actually running
but when I ran it at 720p low settings
it destroyed the core i3 2105 I mean
that makes sense we've got a dedicated
graphics card in there and you can but
you can see here I'm still still
demolishing the 2105 and I've actually
turned the game all the way up to 1080p
all high details now so you can see that
it's much sharper looking there's a very
noticeable difference I mean it looks
like a racing game from you know eight
years ago when you turn the but when you
turn the graphics way down whereas now
it looks like a modern racing game with
pretty decent graphics so that's that's
the difference it makes I just wanted to
show you guys that actually the benefit
is not necessarily in terms of frame
rates from adding these technologies but
actually also in terms of dramatically
improved graphical quality you can see
it's still going to outperform it look
at that okay guys so I'm doing my final
run with 33 with the 838 50 so I'm ready
to present my results pretty much so
I'll talk about everything so far and
then I'll show you guys the results of
this one so I've got my 66 70 here I've
got my core i3 over here and let's have
a look at the results so this is my
onboard graphics showdown at 1280 by 720
I'm using all modern games so yes you're
going to see poor scores here but the
reality of it is these are designed to
be run with modern gaming graphics cards
not with modern onboard so you know they
all did their best however I would like
you to notice something right away so
first of all here's the core i3 2105 we
have for the most part not very playable
frame rates for a bad best around that
30 FPS range and then in dirt3 we
managed to get well over it whereas with
the a8 3850
you can see were for the most part well
into that playable range the exception
being Mafia 2 so that is the difference
in performance between the core i3 2105
and the 838 50 in games so this is at a
very GPU bound resolution but we're
looking at more than double the
performance in dirt three double the
performance and bad company to almost
double in Crysis 2 double in The Witcher
2 more than double in mafia 2 and hub
double again in call of duty black ops
so that is the performance Delta between
the i3 2105 and the 83815 now this was a
bit of an error on my part but at such
low graphical settings we're not seeing
much of a benefit from this additional
graphics card so I want to wanted to
show you guys was yes it does
consistently beat the non graphics
carded version especially see where
we're GPU bound it absolutely blows it
away it adds about double again the
performance of a core i3 2105 where
we're not GPU bound anymore more running
into CPU vom scenarios it doesn't make
much of a difference
see this so here in Crysis 2 it makes
quite a big difference as well so what I
did was I actually ran a grid grid 3
dirt 3 at 1080p all high with 0
anti-aliasing and I got about 60 fps so
you can see that we only lose about half
of the frame rate versus running it on
all low 720p however when we take that
same game and we run it with the a8 3850
which is what I just did we get 29.7 so
you can see that when we are GPU bound
the crossfire
configuration can perform up to double
of the 3850 on its own which is in turn
pretty consistently about double a core
i3 2105 so the reality of it is the CPU
component is not as powerful as a 2105
in pure especially dual threaded
benchmarks it's just not even going to
come close but the a8 GPU just or the
Radeon HD 65 50 d just destroys the
Intel HD graphics
