Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
Haswell system for unbelievable overall
performance the Omni is the first
natural interface for movement in
virtual reality and now we have the
oculus rift we have the Razer Hydra
great devices that really augmented
virtuality experience but next the next
step is how do you walk around in that
virtual world how do you physically move
in a natural way beyond just sitting
down and using keyboard and mouse that's
why we developed the Omni it's an
interface that allows you to walk and
move freely and naturally in your
favorite game well I'm a VR enthusiast
and I was struggling with that question
how do you move around in VR and the
problem of locomotion which is how do
you walk in a confined space that's been
a problem for the last 20 years people
have been trying to build treadmills
that are 360 degrees an omnidirectional
treadmill but nobody's been able to
build one that has been affordable to
consumers or fits in a living room
there's huge devices out there in
academic settings but nothing for the
consumer and that's what what I wanted
to change I wanted to have a device that
I could use in my living room to just
walk around in a virtual world and just
get immerse much more beyond sitting
down the omni recognizes walking running
but also jumping crouching strafing
source software is set up to recognize
basically any moves you'd like to do in
a game and that's what what creates the
freedom and the natural feeling of
movement in the game when you buy the
Omni you get the platform it comes with
a safety belt as well as with a pair of
specialized shoes it also comes with our
integrated tracking hardware and
software right now in the demo we're
using the Kinect but we're working on an
integrated solution with accelerometers
so that you don't need a Kinect so that
whole package that's what you get when
you buy the Omni have a mechanical
engineering background I I'm from
Belgium originally came to the States
for work loved the States never left I
decided to stay here quit my job and
then I went to business school and then
I worked as an investment banker of all
professions for a couple of years but
I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur
and I always liked virtual reality and
gaming so this is what I've always
wanted to do so when the time was there
I started focusing on developing the
Omni at some point to me it makes sense
to quit my job do this full-time and I
jumped into it I I'm going for it I
think it's a it's a great advice and
this is what I wanted to do I want to
bring as many omni's as possible to VR
and 2zs gaming enthusiasts and so forth
it's it's great it I'm able to do this
and I'm enjoying it I think what will
look the more people start using the
rift and start experience experimenting
experiencing virtual reality people will
realize that ok the rift is great it's a
great device but sitting down and having
to use a gamepad or a keyboard it breaks
the immersion if you want true virtual
reality experience you start realizing
well I want to move naturally I want to
move freely I want to move around and in
the virtual game and in my favorite game
and that's what you need the army to
have that extra level of immersion to be
freely immersed in the virtual world and
walk around and I think the need for
that in the desire for that that is what
will drive people to you know buying an
omni and to the extent even in the
future I think virtual reality will be
the next big thing if it's not already
getting there right now and people will
need a virtuality set up the rift the
Omni some controller where it's the
Hydra or a gun so that whole verse
reality set up I think will have a place
in many living rooms or game rooms the
virtual reality community has been great
it's been very has been very
instrumental in driving some of the
recent innovations in virtual reality
such as the rift the Hydra the community
is terrific and our community you know
is also giving me a lot of feedback a
lot of suggestions right now with our
Kickstarter campaign we hope to to get a
help from the community to get funding
and also get more thoughts and an input
to really get the Omni through the
manufacturing stage we already or
designs already we're ready to hit a
button but we need to start tooling
tooling engineering and start get the
Omni manufactured and that's why I would
like to to get a help from the community
and start his Kickstarter campaign I
want to thank the community for
supporting me and my team it's been a
great help in the last couple of months
and
I want to bring the Omni to as many
people as possible so I think with the
help of the community I think we can
make this happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
