the EVGA p55 FTW for the win now you can
see I've actually removed the shrink
wrap because we did try to shoot this
once before I am at home shooting this
video today so someone was talking or
something and that the shot was totally
ruined but I've got everything still in
here we didn't get very far
basically we've got the flexible black
SLI bridge inside for the for the
accessories then we have the ECP v2
breakout board so to speak you've got
your little pins on the back so you use
a ribbon cable to connect this to your
motherboard and then it gives you
onboard power reset clear CMOS voltage
adjustment buttons and then you've got
an a debug post code readout and then
you've got jumpers to turn on and off
different PCIe lanes which is great for
troubleshooting any sort of SLI graphics
card difficulties you've got molex to
SATA adapters then you've got four SATA
cables here we've got two USB and one
firewire PCI bracket then let's get down
to the board oh not quite yet okay well
there's their IO plate just like that
and then here's the cable I was talking
about this is your breakout cable for
the for the ECP v2 okay then we've got
our driver disk then we've got a
QuickStart user guide so this is a
this is the visual guide for the board
so it labels all the different parts and
gives you some basics about the board
and we have the user's manual normal
thing okay and now let's get down to the
board itself so just having my very
first look at this it looks like EVGA s
changed their color scheme quite a bit
with their p55 series motherboards I'm
more used to seeing like a green and
black or a red and black color scheme
out of EVGA and yeah we've got something
totally different here today so let's
just put this box like this okay there
we go so we've got a little thing a
desiccant stuff a little plastic thing
oh that's kind of nice so we've got a
very shiny EVGA logo on what you can see
is a very very weak looking sorry I
can't sing sorry no looking thing that's
very very cool looking then we have a
warning Oh a step-by-step instruction
guide this is kind of cute on how to
install your CPU as you go so that's
actually taped right down to the CPU
socket so that you can't you can't get
at the CPU socket without seeing it so
let's have a look at the board itself
now you've got a three PCIe can a 16 X
connector so you have two PCI connectors
and one PCIe 1x connector you can see
here we've got support for the usual
thing with any p55 motherboard we've got
support for dual channel ddr3 RAM our
power connectors are in the usual places
along the right hand edge of the board
and on the top-left corner of the board
then for our chipset cooling you've got
a little EVGA logo to heatsink down here
now in terms of connectivity we've got
six SATA two ports on the on the edge of
the board here then we've got on the
back on the i/o shield we've got looks
like only six USB ports that's a little
bit less than I was expecting
ps2 on board seamos clear we've got
digital audio eSATA then we've got
firewire 2 Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1
audio and thank you for oh wow no this
is interesting
ok up here on the top left which I
actually didn't even notice before I'm
just peeling the sticker off here you've
actually got two
eight pin EPS connector so it seems that
one of them yeah if your power supply
has an extra eight pin connector plug
both in for extreme overclocking so it's
optional to plug that in but it looks
like you can deliver a lot of juice to
your CPU with this board anyway thank
you for checking out the p55 for the win</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
