the EVGA p55 FTW for the win now you can
see I've actually removed the shrink
wrap because we did try to shoot this
once before I am that from shooting this
video today so someone was talking or
something and the shot was totally
ruined but I've got everything still in
here we didn't get very far basically
we've got the flexible black SLI bridge
inside for the for the accessories then
we have the ECP v2 breakout board so to
speak you've got your little pins on the
back so you use a ribbon cable to
connect this to your motherboard and
then it gives you onboard power reset
clear CMOS voltage adjustment buttons
and then you've got an a debug postcode
readout and then you've got jumpers to
turn on and off different pcie lanes
which is great for troubleshooting any
sort of SLI graphics card difficulties
you've got molex to say the adapters
then you've got four SATA cables here
we've got two USB and one firewire pci
bracket then let's get down to the board
oh not quite yet ok well there's there I
old plate just like that and then here's
the cable I was talking about this is
your breakout cable for the for the ECP
v2 okay then we've got our driver disk
then we've got a quick start user guide
so this is a full 62
this is the visual guide for the board
so labels all the different parts and
gives you some basics about the board
then we have the user's manual normal
thing okay and now let's get down to the
board itself so just having my very
first look at this it looks like II
BGA's change their color scheme quite a
bit with their p55 series motherboards
I'm more used to seeing like a green and
black or a red and black color scheme
out of EVGA and yeah we've got something
totally different here today so let's
just put this box like this okay there
we go so we've got a little thing a
desiccant stuff then we've got a little
plastic things oh that's kind of nice so
we've got a very shiny EVGA logo on what
you can see is a very very weak looking
sort of heat sink sort of looking thing
that's very very cool looking then we
have a warning Oh a step-by-step
instruction guide this is kind of cute
on how to install your CPU as you go so
that's actually taped right down to the
CPU socket so that you can't and so you
can't get at the cpu socket without
seeing it so let's have a look at the
board itself now you've got three pci e
canna 16x connectors you have two PCI
connectors and one pci e 1x connector
you can see here we've got support for
the usual thing with any p55 motherboard
we've got support for dual-channel ddr3
RAM our power connectors are in the
usual places along the right-hand edge
of the board and on the top left corner
of the board then for our chipset
cooling you've got a little EVGA logoed
heat sink down here now in terms of
connectivity we've got six se22 ports on
the on the edge of the board here then
we've got on the back on the i/o shield
we've got looks like only six USB ports
that's a little bit less than I was
expecting ps2 on board simos clear we've
got digital audio e-sata then we've got
firewire two gigabit ethernet and 7.1
audio and thank you for oh wow no this
is interesting okay up here on the top
left which I actually didn't even notice
before I'm just peeling the sticker off
here you've actually got to
8-pin eps connector so it seems that one
of them yeah if your power supply has an
extra 8-pin connector plug both in for
extreme overclocking so it's optional to
plug that in but it looks like you can
deliver a lot of juice to your cpu with
this board anyway thank you for checking
out the p55 for the win</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
