brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so our first video with the
razor suite is gonna be the things that
I'm actually frankly not that interested
in number one is the Nabu X now I talked
about the Nabu when they originally
announced it back at CES last year and
the Nabu X is effectively the lower-cost
version of what was already a very
reasonably priced wearable device albeit
one that didn't have a ton of
functionality so the main selling points
is something like the Nabu we're gonna
be it's got that sort of like privacy
mode read your messages on a little oled
screen on the inside thing it gives you
notifications just like you'd expect any
smart wearable that's paired to your
phone over Bluetooth would it's got some
fitness tracking stuff and then they're
building in these social features that I
don't know maybe you guys have a lot
more friends than I do but I don't know
anyone else who wears the same wearable
as me in fact I don't have many friends
at all so for me it's not much of a
selling point but this one depending on
the pricing they're saying it's gonna be
$49.99 at retail although insiders could
get them for as little as $19.99 might
be a good balance between ok it doesn't
have a lot of functionality but it's
also not very expensive so it's got
three LEDs on the top they are red green
or blue although no color mixing is
supported at this time and then
basically you configure it within their
app to say okay well you know Green is
gonna be oh I don't know missed messages
and then red is gonna be whatever else
when you reach an achievement in your
fitness goals then you can get the
fireworks to go off and there's there's
little ways that you can program it like
that it's got a vibration motor and
unlike the Nabu I can already say that
the build of it seems to be a little bit
smarter so it's got more of a watchband
style band with lots of different
notches so I can actually make it the
right size for my wrist even though mine
are quite small I had a hard time even
getting a watch that was gonna fit me
quite right and the overall ruggedness
of it the module actually fits inside
and it looks like they've built in the
capability to potentially upgrade this
thing in the future although lord only
knows what they would actually do to
upgrade it but the module fits inside
and then it's got what is effectively
the band it makes the band effectively
like a protective housing for the thing
and it really does seem to be designed
to be banged around as long as it's uh
within its protective casing they're
quoting five to seven days of battery on
it which for me is really the magic
sweet spot it's the reason that I'm
still using a pebble instead of an
Android wear device so what do I have to
say about this razors gonna have to
prove to me that social integration with
something like a wearable device like
exchanging you know friend contact
information by shaking hands with
someone or holding wrists with them you
know like I have the power to exchange
contact information with you or see the
last game you played on Steam you're
gonna have to prove to me that that's
functionality that people care about but
in the meantime at least it's affordable
if nothing else and they are doing a lot
of work on the whole health side of
things as well as little as I believe
that a health wearable is actually gonna
make people healthier they're at least
building in support for things like iOS
is health app so you're not tied down to
just using Razer software on your phone
you can actually do other things as well
speaking of not being tied down to Razer
software this is something I wasn't
really expecting to see maybe because I
don't pay attention to rumors at all
maybe because I'm a caveman shut-in and
I don't read anything at all but maybe
everyone knew this was coming but this
is their OS VR head mounted display and
what it is is its OS VR you can tell
there's no Razer branding on it
whatsoever because OS VR is not Razer
owned in the sense that they actually
it's not a company that they own this
isn't a product that they own they're
actually they developed this product and
they are open sourcing the whole thing
so the idea is that they're open
sourcing both the software and even this
piece of hardware you'll be able to
download an excel sheet with every
single component inside this thing and
whether it's for personal use like you
want to change out the 1080p screen for
your own screen if you so desire or
whether it's for commercial use and
other companies want to jump start their
own head mounted display technologies
this thing is going to be completely
free for anyone to use and develop for
and augment or whatever else the case
may be now you might be asking yourself
well what's in it for Razer than at this
point well they've got a couple cool
technologies that they hope to be
contributing to the via
space in general so one of them is a
dual lens system that eliminates
distortion and also actually what's cool
is I believe it's with the knobs on the
bottom but don't quote me on that one
you can adjust it so that if you have a
visual impairment if you need glasses
you should be able to use this by
adjusting the dials to sharpen the image
without glasses
and the other thing is I think they're
more than anything else hoping to sell
people hydras has VR takes off and
becomes more and more ubiquitous so
what's in it for razor well whether or
not they actually release a razor head
mounted display is up in the air right
now but they will definitely be able to
sell peripherals to anyone who's getting
into VR and anyone who's getting into VR
is gonna need a whole new set of
peripherals because that whole keyboard
mouse thing does not work very well
for VR so whether or not this is a
success is is a complete mystery to me
because right now I don't think they
have any comment pretty much whatsoever
from oculus about whether they're gonna
support this whole OS VR thing and I
would suspect that based on that oculus
right now is talking about game games
needing to be developed specifically for
functionality with the oculus we're
gonna be looking at kind of an iOS
Android type approach here where oculus
might be that more closed system but
more tightly integrated and OS VR might
be that shaky at the start but who knows
what the open-source community can do to
polish it over the long term solutions
so exciting and I definitely need to
actually try it out I'll bring you guys
another video trying it out on the floor
if I get some time but the future for
this one is very very hazy both of these
speaking of things that are hazy CES
lots of cigarette smoke in the air lots
of great content and our trip here would
not have been possible without our
