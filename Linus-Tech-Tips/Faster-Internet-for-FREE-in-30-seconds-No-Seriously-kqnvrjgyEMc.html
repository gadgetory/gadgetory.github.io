you can double triple or even quadruple
your internet speed with one easy trick
the answer was to just spend more money
on extra internet connections so I can
understand your hesitation about
clicking this video thank you for giving
me another chance because guess what
this new tip that works on PC Mac Linux
and even your phone will make your
internet anywhere from a little bit to a
metric but ton faster in less than a
minute for free there's a new DNS in
town baby
private Internet access is the VPN
service that encrypts all of your
internet traffic and use a safe
protected IP it's got tons of other
useful features and you can check it out
at the link below so today's tip is
actually nothing new using a faster or
more reliable DNS service than the one
that your good-for-nothing ISP assigns
to you is something people have been
doing for years the new development is
that CloudFlare best known for their
anti DDoS protection service has
released a competitor to major public
dns providers like Google and Open DNS
they're calling it the Internet's
fastest privacy first consumer DNS
service which is kind of a lot of
qualifiers but according to third-party
DNS analytics site DNS perf 1.1 1.1 is
either the fastest or nearly the fastest
DNS across all regions so let's show you
guys how to switch to it CloudFlare
actually has step-by-step instructions
for all of your devices right on their
website we're gonna have that linked
below but for your convenience we've
also included screen capture for the
most popular platforms they're all
basically a variation of digging into
your network settings and reconfiguring
your DNS from auto to 1.1.11
with 100.1 as a backup advanced users
with many devices in their homes may
want to configure their router to
manually use cloud flares DNS as well
which will save them the hassle of doing
this rigmarole on each device
individually and that was it but we
wouldn't blame you guys for not wanting
to switch to some newfangled dearness
resolver before we've explained what
that is and proven that it actually
matters which is why this video is not
over yet
so then what does a DNS do well humans
remember and use domain names like
google.com or Linus tech tips dot-com
but these pages actually live at an IP
address like 104 dot two seven
140 . 189 or with ipv6 it's even harder
to remember meaning that every time you
type in a domain name the translation to
that pages IP address has to be looked
up but this is not as simple as flipping
through a virtual rolodex these records
are decentralized and stored on the
servers of multiple different
registrar's all over the world which is
why you need a service to look up
correct IP addresses after you press
ENTER and since you can't start loading
a page until you know where it is using
a slow overloaded or unreliable DNS
server can noticeably slow down
virtually everything that you do online
so to find out how much faster cloud
flairs option is we use gr C's free DNS
benchmarking tool and the results are a
little mixed but also very promising so
the latency on retrieving cached pages
things that we have already searched for
was actually lower with our local DNS
servers which makes sense because they
are physically closer to us but when it
came to uncashed Names in.com lookups
CloudFlare servers came out ahead
especially when our primary DNS name
server failed since our secondary name
server turned out to be dead which slows
things down and our tertiary and
quaternary name servers are Google's
Public DNS which aren't as fast but
putting the numbers aside 1.1 dot you
know let's just call it 1 dot it felt
faster new tabs opened instantaneously
and videos on YouTube loaded more
snappily than we were used to though it
should be noted that this trick won't
affect the video quality that you can
playback at that still depends on the
bandwidth that your connection is rated
for so then häôs CloudFlare doing this
well many factors affect the speed of a
DNS query but the biggest one is whether
the server can retrieve the answer from
a cache if the domain IP address pair is
already stored in your browser operating
system or DNS server then your dns
resolver doesn't have to balance between
multiple routes and
stars around the world in order to solve
the query so with one dot CloudFlare
pre-fills they're distributed cash out
of bandwidth popular addresses that you
are likely to query and they're also
working to build out their network with
the eventual goal of having every user
within 10 milliseconds of at least one
of their locations in March alone they
enabled 31 new data centers all over the
world and they use fancy query
techniques like aggressive negative
caching to decrease the load on their
system so ok good for them but what if
one dot isn't faster than what you're
already using is there any point
switching to it believe it or not yes
because there are privacy advantages as
well even if you're visiting an HTTPS
website one that supports encrypted data
transfer the fact that you searched for
that site in the first place is still
known by your DNS resolver this means
that by default your ISP your mobile
network provider and every Wi-Fi network
you've ever connected to have a
comprehensive list of every site you
visited while you're using them yeah
while one dot does actually need to log
your IP address to prevent abuse and to
debug issues CloudFlare has committed
with third-party auditing firm KPMG on
retainer to wiping all of their logs
within 24 hours and never writing your
IP address to a disk so they actually
won't know who searched for what sites
they use query minimization to ensure
that they only revealed the specific
data necessary to complete the query and
they support up and coming privacy
standards like DNS / TLS and DNS over
HTTPS and while you might think that
privacy isn't that important consider
that in 2014 the government of Turkey
ordered the country's ISPs to censor
Twitter by blocking DNS requests after a
government corruption scandal leaked
online so in response protesters
actually spray-painted the IP of
Google's DNS resolver all over Istanbul
to help their fellow Turks get back
online so this video sorry it was kind
of heavy but thank you for making this
far ants
using one dot helps you browse faster
which is great but also makes the
internet more secure and open and we
think that particular aspect is priority
number one dot one dot one more one's
looking to build a gaming PC and you
need some sick gaming gear to go with it
well we're teaming up with Rosewill to
give away three gaming bundles to three
lucky winners each one will contain
their cullinan MX RGB case with three
tempered glass panels room for expansion
and more Behr GX 50 headset with clear
sound at an affordable price not that
you'll care you are of course getting it
for free it's got leather and ear cups
and an RGB lit ring and their fusion c40
gaming keyboard which features RGB LED
backlighting and you get a 4000 dpi
optical sensor mouse that apparently
comes with that because it's a combo
haha the more you know learn more and
enter through our link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if this video suck do you know what to
do but if it was awesome can subscribe
hit that like button or check out the
link to where to buy the stuff we
featured which is nothing I don't know
let's put like a network card down there
who cares anyway also linked in the
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
