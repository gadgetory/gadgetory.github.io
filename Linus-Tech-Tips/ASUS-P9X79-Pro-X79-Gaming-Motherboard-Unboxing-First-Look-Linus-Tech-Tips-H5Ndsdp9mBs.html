pro so this is more of a value oriented
although that's very difficult to say
that with a straight face value oriented
x79 board it features most of the same
key key marketing points as the other p9
x79 boards such as they're all new
digital power control for the CPU and
the RAM so dual intelligent processors
so they've got the GPU as well as the
TPU the TPU is cool we actually have a
showdown coming down coming up on my
NCIX comm channel where I'm going to
show you the a to CPU versus the one
touch one button overclocking efforts
that MSI and gigabyte have come up with
and let's just say the TPU wins by a
fairly significant margin ok precise
power control so there's their digi+ VRM
one click speed up with their Asus SSD
caching which is a third party SATA
controller in order to enable that
rather than the Intel controller because
the Intel controller on x79 does not
support that even though z68 does UEFI
BIOS this uses UEFI BIOS is excellent
bluetooth enjoyment ok and quad channel
ddr3 for more bandwidth and up to 8 dims
this fully SLI and CrossFireX ready and
includes support for all the latest 2011
processors including core i7 and core i7
extremes on the LGA 2011 platform so I'm
gonna go ahead and take this board out
like that and we're gonna show you guys
the accessories so ok like I said not
really a value board still a very pricey
board comes with a 3-way SLI bridge you
won't need that for a value board ok
we've got four right angle say 2 3 6
gigabits per second cables and two right
angles SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
cables our front Q connectors so that's
for plugging in your front power and
reset and all that stuff a little bit
more easily flexible isus sli bridge an
IO shield ok look at that CPU
installation instructions in full color
ha ha
Oh as well as oh this is awesome this is
awesome USB BIOS flashback so using that
white port and this button right here
without a CPU plugged in without RAM
plugged in with nothing but power and a
motherboard you can just load a BIOS
file onto a USB Drive plug it in there
and you can flash the BIOS without any
components plugged in which means that
say a new CPU gets released and you buy
it and you soldier old CPU and oh it
doesn't post because it's not updated
for the new CPU yeah it doesn't matter
because you can flash the latest iOS
with just a USB key you don't even need
a CPU so we've got our utilities and
drivers disk which you should not use
you should throw it away and download
the latest from the Asus website and I
think that pretty much covers the
accessories for the p9 x79 pro so let's
go ahead and I'm trying here guys I'm
trying here we go all right so there is
our sexy x79 board because which x79
board is not sexy I would argue that
they all are ok so here we have some
stickers telling us the same things that
were already on the outside of the box
and since at this point we've already
bought the motherboard I'm not sure why
they're still trying to sell it to us
but power to them ok what else we got
here aha this is a good one USB 3 boost
why wasn't that on the box that's an
awesome feature let me see if it is on
the box it must be go away it's not even
oh this is one of the best features on
this motherboard so it supports the
upcoming well huh yeah upcoming cuz
there's really no devices on the market
yet that support it but it supports the
upcoming you asp method of transferring
data to USB 3 which means using the same
USB 3 ports with updated firmware on
your USB 3 devices you can get much much
better transfer speeds and even on non
you ASP USB devices you can still get
better transfer speeds because you can
use the scuzzy protocol which is faster
cool right fan expert plus allows you to
install a I suite 2 and set custom fan
profile see they've got
little tiny picture there and you can
set fan curves based on temperatures and
rpm targets and all that kind of good
stuff which is great
normally you have to buy like expensive
third-party controllers in order to do
stuff like that so we got here we got
our LGA 2011 socket which has 2011 pins
and came out in year 2011 cool we also
got eight that's right eight ddr3 memory
slots which are supporting a grand total
of at this point in time up to 64 gigs
of memory because we only have eight gig
dims as far as unbuffered dims on the
desktop go we've got a heat pipe here
and a vrm solution that actually extends
all the way to the back check that out
so we've got a heatsink here on the on
the voltage regulators that are on the
back the thing about these x79 boards is
look how much space gets taken up by the
sheer size of the socket and all the
memory slots around it so the
motherboard manufacturers have had to be
very innovative about where they squeeze
the voltage the voltage regulators
because look at this here's our eight
pin CPU power capable of sucking up to
200 watts through the socket they have
to build enough digital power regulation
modules around it in order to handle
that kind of a load without overheating
or causing any kind of instability it's
actually kind of a marvel that they can
do it at all to be perfectly blunt
here's our eight pin power connector and
it's ideal location at the top edge of
the board here's our 24-pin power
connector it's ideal location up the
right-hand edge of the board USB 3 front
panel header in its ideal location along
the right hand edge of the board and
check this out we've got on the Intel
controller Tuesday 2 3 6 gigabit per
second ports 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit per
second ports and on the third-party
controller with caching enabled we've
got two more SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
ports front panel connectors are here
the TP you can be enabled or disabled
with the hardware switch here but you
can also turn it off and on in the BIOS
so I don't really see the point of that
there's a clear seamless switch 3 front
panel USB two headers there's the EPU
which is the energy-saving
version of a TPU which is a power more
go faster button version so the
energy-saving version I would say is
less relevant on a performance platform
like this front post LED are not front
post LED there's the actual T
you chip here's your built-in power and
reset switches 1 2 3 4 PCI Express 16x
slots of which 2 are wired for 16 X 2
are wired for 8 X so it's gonna run a
little something like this 16 16 16 8 8
or 8 8 8 8 2 PCIe 1.0 slots our PCIe 1x
slots and no PCI slots yes this is a new
high-end performance platform there are
no PCI slots and no ps2 ports we got 1 2
3 I'm actually not sure if this one even
works as a regular USB port but I'm
gonna count it so for 6 USB 2.0 ports 4
USB 3.0 ports a BIOS reflash button here
Gigabit Ethernet optical audio out that
looks like powered eSATA cool beans
to those and Bluetooth and 7.1 audio out
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the p90x 79
pro for me suits don't forget to
