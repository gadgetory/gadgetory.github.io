Seuss aside from being the notebook that
holds the world record for the highest
altitude terrestrial land party yeah
that's right
ten of these bad boys ascended to the
top of Mount Elbert as part of a
collaboration between tech syndicate
Austin Evans and Newegg
and us where we all play Doom at 14,400
feet but aside from that it's actually a
fairly down-to-earth gaming laptop with
a premium mainstream price
girl-next-door good looks and solid
build quality with its power loss
protection affordability and performance
the SP 924 may data makes upgrading to
an SSD remarkably safe and simple
hardware wise the g550 JK is
appropriately equipped for the price the
core i7 47:10 HQ quad core is suitable
for gaming and light content creation
the single 8 gig stick of RAM is enough
for gaming but would love to have a dual
channel partner for a total of 16 gigs
for heavier work the GTX 850 m GPU will
be enough for light to medium gaming
duties and the 750 gigs 7200 rpm hard
drive strikes a good balance between
storage space and cost and then of
course there's the usual wireless AC
Bluetooth webcam etc now the keen-eyed
among you might have already started
noticing some similarities between this
and the n550 JK also for masseuse and if
you did then Bravo Watson because they
are indeed very closely related but for
those of you not familiar with the n550
will do a physical overview the back of
the screen has a beautiful brushed
aluminum finish that's actually
surprisingly easy to clean
so definitely brownie points they're not
quite sure how they did it other than
that all you'll find back there is a
reflective assist logo and an
illuminated Republic of gamers one on
the bottom we find two cooling intakes
for the dual fan cooling system that is
nearly silent at idle reasonably quiet
under load and does a great job of
keeping the laptop cool our GPU state
around 80 degrees running Unigine heaven
even with the overclocked option enabled
in GPU tweak and more importantly the
GPU was running consistently at around
1.17 gigahertz also on the bottom we
find a very large speaker girl with four
driver
behind it that must be contributing to
the surprisingly loud and solid content
consumption experience especially given
the notebook slim 1.1 inch form factor
because let's face it when it comes to
speakers there's only so much you can do
within a confined space and I was
impressed but then I guess a soos knows
that too because they also include this
sonic master external subwoofer thing
it's not the kind of thing I imagined
I'd use very often but it actually does
dramatically improve the performance of
the already above-average built-in
speakers onto the sides we get an SD
card reader a USB 3 port a DVD writer
and a Kensington lock then on the left
side we've got a headphone / microphone
jack 2 more USB 3 ports DisplayPort and
HDMI video outputs a hardwired Ethernet
port and finally the 8 inch jack for the
external sub and then finally power in
and it might seem like a trivial detail
but the red beveled edge here above the
port's actually looks even more striking
in person than it does on video looks
really really nice but just like for
people a notebook looks can only get it
so far and once we open this baby up we
find the stuff that really matters and
it looks like we're going to start on a
high note my biggest complaint about the
last G Series notebook that we checked
out was the TN screen that suffered from
some wicked color shift a soos has done
away with that on the G 550 JK and gone
with a matte finish 15.6 inch 1080p IPS
screen instead it may not have the most
amazing contrast ratio in the world and
an IPS display won't give you the same
lightning-fast pixel response times that
a TN will but the viewing angles are
solid colors pop like they just aren't
able to on a TN and I even found it
quite usable outdoors as long as I kept
the screen out of super bright direct
sunlight on top of a mountain and the
good news keeps coming the red LED
backlit chiclet keyboard has three
brightness levels and is set into a
pretty solid aluminum wrist rest that is
aluminum so is going to stain eventually
but thankfully uses a more matte style
anodized finish that is much easier to
clean and more resistant to wear than
some of the other finishes that I've
seen on notebook wrist rests over the
past few years aside from the keyboard
we've got a power button a perplexing
dedicated button to access the web
storage that asus includes with the
notebook and a click pad the click enos
of the pad is actually a bit too
stiff for my tastes but it's kind of
academic since I prefer touch to click
or pressing the proper clicky buttons at
the bottom anyway the big thing I look
for in a touchpad is its ability to
reject my fingers and my palms when I'm
trying to use it two handed or when I'm
trying to type and in this regard it
performs admirably it also supports the
usual gestures through a Seuss's utility
one of the many mostly useful things
that they see spree installs on the
notebook including a facial unlock
utility a USB charging utility and their
power for gear power management utility
the only really questionable
pre-installed items I've removed right
away were a trial of McAfee live safe
and some wild tangent game thing battery
life was about what I expected the
notebook lasted for 57 minutes running
heaven starting with a full charge but
of course will the more typical workload
and videos optimist technology hands off
display duties to the onboard graphics
which allowed it to last for just shy of
three hours when browsing the internet
listening to music watching YouTube
videos something that I'd consider to be
a fairly heavy and yet not gaming
workload so gone are the days of
tolerating half an hour battery life
from our you know high powered desktop
replacement in gaming notebooks which I
guess leads us into our conclusion about
the g550 JK this isn't really a little
brother to the beastly G 750 Jay Z so
much as it's more like a sexier trim
level of the n550 the 750 is kind of
like the 6 Series in the family and this
is more like the 3 Series if we were to
make a car analogy it's still tuned it's
still fun to drive but it's overclocked
gtx 850 m is not in the same league as
an overclocked 880 m which raises an
interesting question what is the
competition for this notebook the ge60
apache from msi features gddr5 memory
for improved graphics performance and an
RGB backlit keyboard that comes up a
cost of extra thickness any Seuss's own
n550 JK has a touchscreen but a slower
CPU and only a 5400 rpm lb a higher
capacity harddrive so that's where the
g550 JK comes in it's got its own set of
compromises I mean I'd have liked to see
an SSD
instead of a hard drive or at least an M
sadder and got to upgrade slot but it's
beautiful and solidly built it delivers
very respectable specs for the price and
that's not a bad place to be speaking of
not bad places to be this one was at the
top of a mountain setting a world record
and we are giving it away to one of you
now as you may have already noticed
during the b-roll for this video it is
covered with a whole bunch of cool
signatures from people who were also at
the top of the mountain including
loganing came from tech syndicate Paul
and Kyle from Newegg Austin from Austin
Evans and of course me and Luc from the
