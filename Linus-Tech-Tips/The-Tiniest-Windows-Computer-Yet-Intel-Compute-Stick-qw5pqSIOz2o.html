attractive than this little HDMI stick
they're both computers and the
impossible standards set by the media
all computers are beautiful and you're
going to hurt the little computes text
feelings it's a computer too and if you
don't think so you can keep your scummy
hands off of it non aggressively hit the
like button down below if you'd like us
to check out a video on a portable IPS
monitor in the future freshbooks is the
super simple invoicing solution that
lets you get organized save time and get
paid faster click now to learn more the
definition of the Intel compute stick is
actually rather simple
it's an Intel based computer on a stick
naturally due to its size it's not all
that powerful but there are also two
versions of it one of which was
available now and the other of which is
coming later depending on which model
you get the stick will have some pretty
major changes the first six unique items
are Windows 8.1 with big put what they
share is an intel atom z3580 phix an
integrated single stream 802 11 BGN
wireless connection Bluetooth 4.0 a
microSD card slot and one USB 2.0 jack
and the obviously required since it's an
HDMI stick HDMI 1.4 a connector it's
considerably bigger than your average
USB stick it's more like four of them
kind of stacked in a little square at
one hundred three point four millimeters
by thirty seven point six millimeters by
12.5 millimeters and it's powered
through its micro USB jack which can be
plugged into essentially whatever can
push 5 volts in 2 amps over USB so a
nice battery bank or what until expects
you use the included wall wart with
travel adapters why does it come
natively with travel adapters well that
leads us into usability until wants you
to be able to take and use this thing
virtually anywhere that you can use a
computer bring it with you to on your
travels and have a power adapter for
whatever plug you really need
to use bring it with you so that you can
have a presentation and you don't have
to have the classic fight of trying to
figure out their crazy freaking computer
plug it into the TV in your hotel room
and then you don't have to deal with
whatever is on their TV and you can
watch or listen or do whatever the heck
you want until it's a very business ii
company and this is a very business ii
product but that doesn't mean that it
has to be I mean sure this thing is a
very super easy solution for digital
signage or a really affordable way to
get workers hooked up to computers when
they just need to do something simple
like using the Microsoft Office suite
maybe some other simple ish programs but
for the home user that is looking for
something maybe more advanced than the
experience that a chromecast or Roku
stick this could do the trick no it
won't have the inherit ease of use that
casting has but you can do more things
with it so if that works for you then
great in terms of gaming I wouldn't
expect much the Wi-Fi connectivity is a
little bit lacking with a single stream
if you're going to be game streaming and
the performance is a little lacking for
playing games directly off the device so
unless you stick to very basic games in
both cases you're not going to have that
great of a time there's loads of uses
for this thing emergency computer you
could keep it in your car or in your
backpack and if your laptop and phone
and whatever else dies you could plug
this into any screen pretty much
anywhere TV screen hotel room monitor in
a library I don't know if that's legal
don't hold me to that one you can plug
it into pretty much anything and have
your own computer wherever you really
need to go that can connect to Wi-Fi
networks and do a whole bunch of other
really cool stuff or it can be a travel
thing so it's not a like fallback it
could be like I said going into hotel
rooms playing it into TVs using it for
presentations it could be use for school
you can go into libraries and plug it
into that monitor there so you can use
the library's resources use their
printers do all that kind of stuff but
then you don't have to use a school
computer you can actually use your own
it's an interesting device in an
interesting spot with value competitors
like the chromecast and performance and
competitors like the Nvidia shield it
definitely has its work cut out for it
and its value will be maybe a little bit
hard to see because there is those
really strong
competitors but that doesn't mean it
doesn't have its place in the market a
whole windows 8.1 machine on a stick is
super impressive what do you guys think
