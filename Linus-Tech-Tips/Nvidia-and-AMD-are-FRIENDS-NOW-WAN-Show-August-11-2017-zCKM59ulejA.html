a prick
I think calling it a rough week would be
a gross understatement like disgusting
understatement it has been so tiring
like shot three LT t's shot and reviewed
three fats and also moved into a new
office space went to the strata meeting
for our building complex here dealt with
the inspector failing us oh also by the
way I found out we are going to have to
clear the path to at least one of the
rear doors that are now covered behind
sets do I need to go on like can I just
you know go off for a bit here about
know how this week went because I want
to know more of open doors we have had
all hands on deck basically reorganizing
this entire place for three days and
with all the stuff that people had to do
and just with all the stuff that needed
to be done it has been a nightmare like
if you guys have seen any behind the
scenes footage we're going to have a
whole organization vlog series coming
because that's the only way that we can
get around to cleaning stuff up is by
vlogging about it but like that unit on
the other side of this wall that I'm
pointing
right there that wall the brown wall the
unit on the other side their total
disaster if you were ever wondering what
happens when you tell a dozen people hey
there's an empty unit so like if there's
any overflow it goes in there if you're
ever wondering what that looks like
after six months boy do I ever have the
answer for you a little fun like that by
the way Colton that that crate that you
just saw that is leftover /ex
when show stuff and then that an
Techland boy is the recreation of
Linus's first pc so that could be like a
charity auction thing for LTX next year
or something I don't know what else we
would do with it so like oh and like the
kind of crap that we're cleaning up like
we're talking the rotted out husks of
old CRTs and like I meant literally
rotting house like oh no no but like
dangerous yeah and like furniture that
we haven't used in months like the the
couch that used to be on the ltte set
that just went to unit 101 oh this was a
good one
this was a really good one so you know
those old shelves we had back at the
Langley place in the background yeah
okay though that was like the old a roll
when we were shooting in the dining room
you know like wood code yeah the wood
color ones okay so all the shelves for
them we're in a scrap wood bin and then
those with just the MiG shelves had just
like a plank across them and were being
used as like a warehouse rack and I'm
kind of sitting here going you know we
actually have scattered around the two
warehouses many many pieces of warehouse
racks that could have been assembled to
make a warehouse rack but like to be
clear I understand why people are doing
these things a lot of the time because
they don't have time to solve the
problem properly and we're like
constantly working at a frantic pace
around here like I get it that just
doesn't make it not frustrating and yeah
so lots of people moved locations random
acts are in the camera den now I'll
Luke has his own office have their
office baby it's cool I stole to the
beanbag chairs yes all that I will have
the comfiest meetings ever with my
employees that are they will have the
comfiest meeting my friend called me
they were like dude you have the
comfiest meetings yeah I know it's it's
it's weird it's very weird because I've
been with John for like two years
actually slightly more than that because
in the previous office I was also with
John so you upgraded your workspace
because you have an office with a door
but I downgraded your neighbor yeah yeah
and I because I don't have one anymore
yeah and I do massive right now New York
but he's not like he has to sit next to
Nick but there's like a big wall and
stuff like John I had a communal space
and now like I got Brandon's old desk
yeah my actual usable desk space
probably went down yeah a little
actually like 30-something percent yeah
like it's actually a I used to have all
three of my monitors and quite a bit of
usable space if I have all three of my
monitors and that's where the desk and
maybe I was sending a message of what
about all the that you don't need
to keep on your desk anymore I'm
probably gonna get another desk - yeah
mostly because I want more monitors so
yeah I'm going to put monitors there I'm
probably going to go like I like it all
in that one in Craigslist for like 25
bucks each cuz I just need junk Oh
crappy monitors to do that server
monitoring right I don't mean ice one
you know we could probably figure out is
like we have a knife in it East and that
I don't think anyone knows what yes like
maybe we could anyway that would you
know like before you do furniture for
your office you're going to want to oh
wow that looks really different and it
doesn't anyway we'll solve that later oh
yeah we moved the lens show yeah sort of
yeah so it's like 10 feet back from
where it was the camera is now is
essentially where the desk was that more
or less before frankly I don't think it
makes a huge difference to the quality
of the show I mean this show wasn't
great quality anyway and I think it's
gonna be a lot easier for people to move
around now it's not like right in the
middle of a high-traffic area so this is
interesting you didn't know this oh
sorry before no before you do for an
insurer stuff in there check with Yvonne
because like there will probably be like
I'll plan already like we might be able
to get you like some shelving I'm not
I'm staffer worried about that like
we'll deal with it but Tom the head on a
little notepad of both things that I
like one the hexagon wall from the
spaceship so the plan is to just lift
that up you know the RGB wall yes okay I
think that's just going to go like right
here well that's cool
yeah yeah because the spaceship is dumb
and needs to go like getting rid of that
yeah we're getting rid of the spaceship
and we're just turning that whole area
into like a condo alright actually yeah
coming back to the final inspection so
the theory was that the inspector would
come in and look only at the new tenant
improvement and that was actually why we
built the new tenant improvement like a
half a centimeter away from the old one
so that it would actually be a
completely separate structure so the
inspector will not come look at our old
tenant improvement because if they did
that then any code changes in the last
two and a half years would have to be
retrofitted to that one you don't want
that that's a big problem yeah okay so
it turns out they also want to look at
the warehouse space because that's under
the new tenant improvement so that needs
three exits to the outside and I thought
that those two front doors would still
count but technically one of those front
doors which is now enclosed and is a
dedicated exit for the new improvement
because it needs dedicated exits because
it's not actually technically part of
the old improvement that doesn't count
for the warehouse even though assuming
that the employees of Lynas Media Group
are not a bunch of raving idiot I'm sure
people would be able to figure out to
open one more door to get to the outside
and there are already two exits but we
need three so those ones are technically
sort of obstructed right now well that
one definitely is well on the one behind
where the the long-term dust project
that one definitely is too so there's
one here one there we only have two so
the good news is that we were planning
to
rearrange some stuff anyway that way so
workshop is maybe going there but then
maybe also staying here because like
it's pretty I like this that it's the
one that I still really like yeah but
the green screen is going to shrink and
then we have condos are going to move
this way but then what we could do is we
could maybe come get our final
inspection while
that stuff's kind of torn down and in
flux and then maybe the inspector could
GTF out of here and then if there ever
was a fire there would actually be two
full exits for the maximum like five
people that are ever in the where I know
there would definitely be 3 3 full exits
people for the 5x5 exit yeah many all
the exits we have the best exit which
America pay for the exit those jokes
like just never get old I know right
it's like I have an intro of the show
yet oh right yeah anything else crazy
happen this week
Thomas the inspector part anything else
crazy I don't know all the things like
it was like archaeology town around here
man like honestly organization vlog
could be as much fun as moving vlog
because even though we didn't know I
don't I don't know yeah yeah someone
broke into my van and it's also we're
talking about yeah no I'm not going to
give up so like I was a good so yeah but
like I'm a really loud trafficked
honestly we've actually here wrap your
brain around this okay I'm about to blow
your mind all right we've been in here
longer than we were in the Langley house
no I know I had that realization I
walked out of my office today to come
down to here and was like bye office and
then just like brain wave hit me and I
fell over into a beanbag chair so I was
like holy crap
because I was like I was like that felt
more impactful than leaving the old
office and I was like I wonder why I was
like oh wow we did in there forever yeah
yeah they're not crazy what's your
anniversary on Monday it's your - you
want years yeah is that past the point
where I can just fire you for no cause
and with no notice is it Matt Matt Matt
hahaha that's like yeah dog alright well
then I guess you're so much in Colton
yeah we're going on the team
let's see some ads hahaha I'll get to
the ads later at it later um so yeah
there's actually like more archaeology
to do here yeah then there was there and
you remember how frickin O'Reilly's nuts
yeah that place was so yeah it's going
to be a lot of fun and there's a lot of
personalities involved okay
things got snippy hello cuz like I know
you weren't here that is awesome the
teen chat though things have gotten a
little snippy you know there have been
some there have been some messages to
the group chat about it grading people's
ability to park their cars yeah are
enough back from the sidewalk yeah um
you know like there's been no that was
probably a little over the line sassy
and so yes that's that's gotten real
this week about I mean wow I'm like on a
train
yeah I mean while you're on a train I
can't really tell about what my event
was retrieving our broken company van
yeah which was like so I was expecting
this train trip to be horrible and we
got two hours of sleep beforehand
yeah docked but like it's a train trip
so whatever yeah I got held over at the
border they didn't want to let me down
because they couldn't understand what I
was going down at me del lab me well
they're like why are you going here I
need Union and you do right now that
don't really don't know I guess I
remember they're like they're wondering
why I was going so far to pick up the
vehicle and then like stopping off
somewhere else that's not a question it
wasn't my vehicle to fare class and then
he kept on getting confused what who I
worked for
okay which was really difficult enough
Aaron question well not really because
he would be like who do you work for and
be like Linus Media Group
who owns a vehicle Linus McGee group
okay so is it your vehicle is like no
it's the company what companies Linus
Media Group no thank you
so you did make it pretty easy on him
yeah like it wasn't it wasn't super
complicated Oh cousin yeah we got pulled
in and it wasn't it just took an
annoying amount of time when like
there's a train that's going to leave
right by left intentionally like way
early so I ended up being totally fine
which is part of the reason why I got
such a small amount of sleep or whatever
and then the Wi-Fi on the train was
legendary no streaming of any kind of
loud yeah not even a lot of your music
okay any files above 10 Meg's they just
killed really yeah you can you know you
can VPN it usually yeah some of the some
of the eyeliner on the ferry in half
like I'm not new to that but it's just
like ah alright come on come on
and then so I get down there get the
vehicle to find trigger rods shop it's
amazing yeah holy cow his CNC is
incredible it's so it's expensive but
it's badass
um rods pretty dope and then I went up
to Microsoft and things happened and
then you guys will hear about that later
yeah so by my week was definitely more
eventful than yours
I mean might was pretty eventful yeah
yeah you know but we wouldn't know that
no right good owned right um alright so
I guess we should get into the news for
the week we haven't even rolled the
intro well we go without looking at the
doc okay I beg a thread Ripper core i9
maybe Nvidia did something yeah cool
don't call intro get it through it
all the first topics are i9 thread
Ripper in Vegas sick-sick bra I'm trying
to see if invidious something but I
don't think so
maybe it just wasn't newsworthy because
like it didn't make it into the circle
jerk right yeah am I allowed to say
Circle Jerks while I'm flashing our
sponsor logos on the screen let's just
hope they don't look at that part
alright and yeah it must be the land
show that's weird i resized it not look
so different to me kind of under yeah we
could probably move it a little closer
even try and take out even less me set
there yeah all right so why don't we
move into our first tech topic of the
week so the core i9 CPU lineup specs
have been finalized this is according to
PC per and it was posted by the
Benjamins over on the forum now there
was a lot of speculation that the reason
that Intel wasn't finalizing some
aspects of their of the rest of the core
I 9 lineup was because they had no idea
if they were going to be able to make
these bloody things based on how much
power they were going to consume and how
much heat they were going to output
which ok is kind of a weird trend can I
just say if these processors being a
huge amount of power he's going to heat
Vega huge amount of power huge amount of
heat where for the last longest time
it's just like those things don't matter
because they're just constantly going
down well that's I guess what what
competition does is it forces you to
push the envelope a little bit yeah
which is cool so here we go so skylake X
goes up to 18 course as we already knew
but this is some interesting stuff a
little turbo up to 4.4 gigahertz at
turbo boost max speeds and little turbo
boost at Turbo Boost 2.0 speeds of up to
4.2 gigahertz so that's uh that's pretty
sick I guess it'll cost 2 grand which we
already knew and it'll have 18 cores 36
threads as we already knew so the
pricing looks like from
7900 X which is kind of the flagship
right now at a thousand bucks you're
going to pay two hundred two hundred
three hundred then another three hundred
to get twelve fourteen sixteen and
eighteen course respectively and they
pretty much are all going to turbo the
same except the seventy nine hundred X
and the seventy eight twenty which are
going to hit 4.5 gigahertz so those are
your single thread kings if you need a
high core cam processor because
otherwise you're just getting a seventy
seven hundred K because you're not
stupid enough to spend money on an LGA
2066 motherboard so you can put a
seventy seven forty on it how that
stacks up with thread Ripper is that
basically multi-core at the same core
counts performance is going to look
fairly similar remember skylake is a
generation behind kb lake on the
consumer side so that is one fewer
generational improvement that AMD has to
fight with on this platform so at
similar core counts they're going to
perform pretty similarly except maybe a
little less for AMD because their max
turbo is four gigahertz but what AMD
brings to the table is higher base
clocks so in those highly threaded
workloads AMD is going to look pretty
good and they bring lower pricing to the
table so your sixteen core is going to
cost a thousand bucks so mg is going
head-to-head against intel's ten core
and their twelve core gets to go up
against somewhere between and eight corn
a ten core but that eight core is
actually kind of kneecapped with only
twenty eight PCIe lanes versus red
rippers full 64 and then the 1900 x is
that kind of weirdo skew where it's only
got eight core 16 threads just like the
consumer top end risin seven but it's
got 64 PCIe lanes for being able to put
like lots of GPUs or other devices on it
and Nick need something what can I do
for you
you need me like water like the other
one I'm going to show you guys something
while Linus is gone that I just think is
absolutely wonderful is that what I
opened it on the wrong computer it's
okay I'll figure this out
perpetual window talk so this happened
on Twitter you guys might have seen it
it was pretty popular on the reddit
today but Nvidia tweeted out welcome
back AMD thread Ripper and the GeForce
1080 TI makes a compelling pair it's
interesting because yet remember that
there are technically separate business
groups the graphics cards and the CPUs
on AMD side so Nvidia is like totally
okay with doing stuff like this
who the flight is coming in one second I
think with that we're going to move on
Wow oh okay hold up how do we turn this
back on does it automatically you can
talk normally it just automatically
turns back on okay so unfortunately a
light that is like right here was
unplugged and it takes like a long time
for it to heat up
which does that make sense because it
was already hot Oh we'll figure it out
get back
you're in a vacuum here right now oh no
I know unplugging that you okay anyway
sorry moving on who enter max who's
going to have the first out of the gate
a IO four thread Ripper I'm going to
drop this into the chat and then try to
get it up on screen we were quick I
don't see it warming up so I'm really
not sure about that yeah that might be a
good idea what's up what's up we're
going to talk about trade routes first
waterblock and I showed off yeah Colton
that I simply unplug that I showed this
up he accidentally copyright strike our
own channel while he's at it
yeah you heard me Colton I showed this
off real quick oh cool what yeah that's
what happened on Twitter no yeah you
know with how much bad blood there is
between those two companies like that
almost comes across as like throwing
shade man yeah like oh man that is like
honestly like the way okay so first of
all so AMD did segment the company so
they switched over to you guys so that
when you're going Andy and radio
technologies group so like technically
in videos just talking to the CPU so
yeah and technically a lot of the bad
blood really is between Nvidia and ATI
yeah that's how far back it goes
but like the engineering teams they like
the engineering team and AMD contains
ATI people still like first shirt yeah
like there's a lot of lifers that are
still around there um hey Brandon is it
like coming back so
here-here-here not a sign sign all right
I don't see it warm enough I got a
solution here look it's not it's not
what oh nice yeah yeah we use the
flashlight flashlight on the phone baby
there we go
no problem okay we got this we got this
so what's what's your vibe what's your
vibe genuine genuine welcome back to the
enthusiasts party or or are they
throwing shade like like haha you
weren't you weren't around for five
years I would give them benefited out
here you would give Nvidia the benefit
of the doubt when it comes to crapping
on AMD okay but it is crapping on them
the welcome back mmm-hmm the welcome
back part is crapping on them but they
are legitimately saying like we think
our GPUs will work well with your CPUs
which they will yeah and they are
legitimately saying that so I think
they're like like to the guy who like
goes on vacation for a year and then
scores his first touchdown after like a
really really really long time and
you're like welcome back you did a good
job it gets a little sassy but at the
same time you're like okay good job or
it's just broken now yeah it's possible
that we like hey it's on okay
oh lordy okay what else we got in the
news this hearing train Wow
world's worst throw sorry this is
interesting so this is supposed to
buying Ritter knack on the forum or
thread Ripper news the Iridium is gone
it's warming up now you guys will ya
come on right it's coming it's done the
original article is from Tom's Hardware
okay so there was a lot of controversy
over Intel's
I don't even remember the stupid
features called anymore but they're
bootable raid that bypasses the PCI
Express controller and the chipset and
go straight off the C ah Bob something
something rocks
dang it d-roc so vrock Intel's software
raid that's running straight off the CPU
that's bootable there's a lot of
controversy over Intel's intention to
allow users to upgrade to it with like a
hardware like enabling key that they
have to plug into the network although
so I'll give them this though they were
a step ahead of AMD who is straight up
not able to support bootable nvme raid
at all right now so there you go many
people do you think this excludes ok two
answers answer number one
very few yeah answer number two within
the community of users that are going to
buy it or buy a thousand dollar
processors yeah $400 motherboards if I'm
spending this kind of money on a
motherboard I better have cashola to the
wrong one and be MLA but even then
buying a one terabyte nvme Drive it's
just your bootable Drive and then doing
other stuff with other things like hard
drives and whatnot for like huge amounts
of story to be on that seems pretty
reasonable I think yeah even my crazy
stupid over built computer just has one
nvme drive and and it's lightning fast
and I can't tell the difference between
the stuff that's on the state of rape
yeah as it's pretty fast having like
three really quick SSDs in raid 0 so
there aren't a ton of of consumer
applications for nvme raid boot drives
however drives that's that's the part
that I'm trying to make very clear that
I'm talking about it you can always
software raid nvme drive yeah that's
been I have a software rate of ng me
drives that we're running our editing
server awesome yeah so we're not really
talking about boot pro yeah and honestly
I have a hard time telling the
difference between an nvme boot drive
and even a good SATA SSD boot drive like
not even read zero unless I'm hitting it
pretty hard
yeah
however Red River is being targeted at
the workstation user as well as the
enthusiast who's just like Cooper given
what's best girls are going to go faster
and just like buying more nvme drives
even though they know they can't tell
the difference and on the workstation
where you're working with some like huge
data set or something we're talking 16
cores crunching it you could run into an
i/o bottleneck well how do you care
about it being on the boot drive also
they're enabling the future in the
future so this is kind of an odd story
and I know that weren't at Lourdes okay
now just Mouse's mostly like it barely
matters and it only matters for a
limited period yes all right
this is kind of okay this is one of
those things where like it's kind of
like Intel having okay so Intel had
support for our nvme raid within there
what's that stupid rst rapid orange
technology or SR - no rst their rapid
storage technology like their driver
like software raid doodad that lives in
the film track
so yeah okay so they had support for
nvme raid going back quite a quite a
ways but the problem for me when I
bought that 48 nvme murder if you'll I'm
sorry I shouldn't say bought because
Super Micro sent it to me but I bought
the drives that laminate going back
quite a ways and so remember making the
video for like the first Drive let alone
right anyways okay so when I got the 48
Drive server I ran until these problems
trying to create a raid array because it
turned out that it was capped at 12
devices I was like well this is a
spectacularly first world problem very
few people like like you know no one
else had ever brought it up to Super
Micro I was like hey so you've got this
48 drive enclosure like how do you run
all the drives together
they're like nobody's ever
like what do you mean nobody's ever
asked like well don't take this the
wrong way Linus but most of the people
using a device like this I know what
they're doing I mean they said it a lot
nicer than that like way nicer than
looks okay but it was pretty savage and
I got all the way to like what are there
like a like class support texts and the
guys just like yeah like we're shipping
this crap to like you know
Tier one software companies like they've
got their own proprietary crap they're
running on it like like there's like
four tching Linux distros to like build
their own yeah freaking thing and I'm
like so like you know you got a number
for someone over there if anyone asked
me after all like Oh brutal yeah so I
end up with Windows storage spaces which
is what you great by the way
boom which is working great by the
Working Group what for me what's not
working great I I have I've talked to
multiple people about it I tried to set
up my system with storage spaces oh yeah
do you remember cuz the like evidence
lots of problems with those two boards
the first one wouldn't do with certain
RAM configuration yeah yeah the second
one I had just no raid setup
yeah it just didn't exist on the board
at all yeah so I was like uh yeah high
storage spaces and everyone was like
it'll be fine yeah I'm fine for
everything except for Ubisoft games oh
really okay with that I didn't see
coming
Dean games launched fine yeah origin
games ma I think I've had problems with
like one or two and they were like super
retro II ones all the new ones work fine
and then every single Ubisoft game
doesn't work at all you know you have an
AZ anyway if I were you I would just be
soft and Ivan the mirror is yeah doesn't
matter yeah it's just it's just annoying
like why am i okay we could definitely
blame Ubisoft here but at some degree
it's probably I wouldn't be surprised if
it's both sides to a little like a
little bit yep I don't know I think you
and as also supports ice geysers you
could set up a nice cozy to be totally
fine
yeah that would probably
I would probably do it um I'd be loading
games off hard drives I don't want to
put everything over there yeah right
yeah oh this is cool let's just supposed
to buy the angry computer masher on the
forum the original article is from video
cards
apparently red ripper water blocks are
coming which is important because red
ripper is also a human written yeah so
it's available in a variety of different
colors there's red there's silver it's a
variety of sorts and if by a company
called Biscay by ski the chinese there
are so many chinese case and like
cooling manufacturers that I had never
freakin heard of when I went over to
Computex like cognitively I'm aware that
there is a billion people in China and
cognitively I'm aware that that's as
many people as there are in North
America and like I think most of Europe
combined like cognitively I'm aware of
these things so it makes sense then that
there would be like for every ek and
Swift tech and in jeans whip tech right
I've never heard of this company before
I'm going to assume that they're bigger
than both of them it could be so for
every ek and every Swift tech there's
probably a brand that exists solely
within China that's that's bigger bigger
and please there's got to be great for
that company because then you only deal
with that country yep issues and your
shipping well it has some pretty special
issues but right we've learned that yeah
like apparently there's a whole like
bribe economy in the tax system yeah so
when you're paying local taxes there's
like bribes that used to play along with
the taxes and that can depend on like
who the person is and what their status
is and it changes over to almost
impossible to automate and like like
it's pretty it's pretty sketchy actually
but yeah yeah but but you'd probably get
used to it if you're there you're what
life you get used to it and like
shipping stuffs probably relatively
simple for her
over times of different borders not
doing with all that although I think the
last mile is legitimately by bicycle in
China so there's that oh oh not all of
them
I mean shipping to like stores and stuff
yeah but carry on well it's impossible
that it's all of them no no okay yes not
everything yes you have yep but looks
like big apartment buildings yes yes yes
I doubt you're shipping a thread Ripper
to like uh-huh you know what we should
go on a field trip to China at some
point like I've been there now you've
been there right but I was there for
like 48 hours tops
I similar yeah like I was like in my
hotel room full planning almost the
entire and like I was in a hotel that
specifically had instructions for how to
bypass the Great Firewall of China oh
yeah my only exposure to it was like on
TV
something came on I was like like I know
what's behind that but like why are you
even bothering like huh I like I
couldn't even figure out why they didn't
want people to know about that specific
thing that I was like oh yeah look at
that they really do censor TV how about
that but but it would be it would be
interesting to just go see like Chinese
land parties and like oh my god you know
don't worry super cool like that would
be pretty that'd be pretty fun like
isn't one of Nvidia's like big like sort
of like we're out of meters there I
think so and we should try to meet with
like a big Chinese like computer
hardware reviewing group yeah I've been
very interesting see what they do be
like like a studios yo what's up yeah
like how do Hardware reviews work in
China cuz like honestly they're like
what are your big brands yeah like the
truly global manufacturers the guys like
Intel yeah like they could put us in
touch yeah for sure
AMD would probably be easier actually
because they're less segmented from
region 2 right cuz they're a smaller
company you know because they haven't
had a great time here but yeah like
someone like AMD could probably be like
yeah like here's the guys who matter in
China I can't be sad or interesting I
wonderfully be able to get a visa for
that
it's media so it would be harder yeah
but speaking of meetings or something
making of visas get out your wallet cuz
its sponsor time come on I was pretty
good okay Mac Weldon believes in smart
design premium fabric and simple
shopping and you know what it's one
thing to say they believe in it but they
actually like do care about it and do do
that because like you know I could say
Linus Media Group believes in high
production values but when push comes to
shove you know we release a video every
day organization vlog we believe we
believe in relatively high production
yeah Matt Weldon will be a most
comfortable underwear socks shirts
undershirts hoodies and sweatpants that
you will ever wear that is their
guarantee and this is like the coolest
thing about their lineup they have a
line of silver underwear and shirts that
are naturally antimicrobial which means
that they don't think the way that
regular shirts do before you said that
someone in the chat said antimicrobial
yes antimicrobial yes look bad no Mac
well vacanam you can get 20% off with
offer code tectus over at Mac Weldon
they will even send you your first pair
and you can cheap it and they will still
refund you if you don't like their stuff

during the next spot so fresh books is

whole experience with you on the go so

if you have any questions you can call
them their support staff legitimately
just picked up phones like hi fresh
books what can I help you with no
escalations they're all trained up and
there's no phone tree nothing like that
so try it out for 30 days for free by
heading over to fresh books calm /when
and Entering when in the how did you
hear about a section that's a it was
30-day free trial
speaking of free trial you and I got a
huge variety of spectrum glasses to try
out and I am planning to wear mine for
the rest of the show I don't know about
you okay I'm down
I am totally again I've picked mine
already I actually checked out all of
them oh really
oh well those are kids oh really oh you
can try that and I think these are more
for ladies you know what you know what
cat eyes I'll try them on so they got a
bunch of different styles you know what
it comes one this is artist
you're not going to fit big-time good
wine Brian alright so this is the artist
style oh my god they're amazing you know
what's funny they even have like a
lovely adorable
heck yeah these are off you know what's
so funny
about like Hitler people hey they've got
the they're double-jointed so when they
drop them or sit on them over there and
even even the other old folks will stuff
okay the more thing about hipster like
artists people is that these were
legitimately what my grandma was wearing
in the late 90s now that's a cool trendy
thing for young people because that's
how it works apparently unlike in these
I'll wear these to the wrists I actually
I'm down for I'm down for the hipster
I'm down for the hipster like because we
got like the the yellow and black kind
of alternating kind of pattern around
them see it actually looks pretty good
okay right right don't look at on
YouTube I think they're slightly too
round but when you're looking at the set
like this pattern yeah it's really good
on you cool yeah well I'm happy to be
trendy anyway the point is spectrum
glasses are for folks who stare at a
monitor all day they filter the blue
light but let through the yellow and
they are meant to make it more
comfortable to be using a screen all day
monitors do have a blue light mode but
that's only really gotten popular within
the last few years so there are
literally millions tens of millions of
monitors and laptops actually out there
that do not have a mode like that and
while there are software solutions it is
not the same type of filtering these do
yeah they're stylish that's one of their
talking points we'll let you guys be the
judge so they're stylish they have low
color distortion and highest rated among
competitors on Amazon so they're
primarily focused on the Canadian and US
markets but they're expanding to Europe
and they offer international shipping so
check them out over at spectrum glasses
comm slash collection slash products we
really need a better vantage you are
Elle and you can get 10% off using offer
code Linus okay all right so let's see
what else what else we got here uh uh
float
I got we got news oh yeah oh yeah cool
what's up on full swing right now um oh
I've never well you're giving that up I
can talk about this is I don't think we
need anything on screen for this
necessarily discord is announcing video
chat and screen sharing although one big
thing that's going to lack on this
launch is there won't be any audio
pass-through for the screen sharing
although I don't necessarily know if I
care all that much hmm I'm sure it
matters to certain degrees that like
something where they're running into
like DRM sort of all restrictions
possibly or like passing the video
through yeah but if they can't pass the
audio like that it would less like it
would make the group movie watching
experience a little less right likely I
could maybe I don't if it does it I'm
just guessing so pretend skate maybe has
a bigger legal team or something I don't
know they are saying now friends on
discord can watch each other play their
favorite games while talking
face-to-face that sounds weird I don't
know if that's really going to be a
thing but it might be a lot easier for
streamers maybe you're just getting old
maybe that's possible I could see it
being a much bigger thing for streamers
discord already has streamer mode and
like ties into twitch where you can have
all your subscribers in your twitch
channel and all this kind of stuff and
if you can have voice and video
call streamers could have like a
streaming room and be in streaming mode
right and all kind of stuff and use that
instead of like Skype for playing doing
streams collaboratively right makes a
lot of sense all right I've got a lot of
good stuff on floatplane this week
actually we've got the cheapest PC case
on the market oh man we found it we ha
trotted that's not out of it it's
actually awesome and I like looks really
cool it's actually sick Alex did a great
job
I love how now that we have like Alex
and these other guys yeah it's like oh
this thing sucks
will like tear the trash out of it and
like make fun of it and then make it
awesome sort of mod that's right baby
4k gaming at 120 Hertz on a DIY monitor
what yeah baby
way did you make that wait it's a kid
okay that's cool unboxing da real razor
Tulsa is Nvidia ruining your performance
by sandbagging their drivers oh that's a
trigger II video I know I know but it
had to be done course it had to be done
um we've got a couple of others we've
got a lot of behind the scenes logs and
stuff like that you got a couple tech
quickies
crappy-ass sli setup of all time we've
had a lot of simultaneous releases
lately so it's pushed out some pretty
old videos that have been taking a while
to make their way to the platform but
we've got some but like it kind of in
place of that there has been a lot of
wool sounds on there has been a lot of
like good moving stuff yeah I've
actually got one more vlog and then I'm
going to start doing some meet the team
pieces because people have asked for
like kind of proper intros to some of
the new people you know what's
interesting talking about stuff on
YouTube now that did really well on Flo
plain as well and if you're on full
plane you would have seen it earlier is
the the Pippen video yeah did you really
hope people love that know going do it's
beating the thread Ripper 1.1 million
amuse on I maybe did it helped that we
had a sealed well some people were
pretty salty that we opened that thing
hey really yeah they were like that was
what vintage and
I see their point like it was not sealed
it's not like you can make a new not
filled one I don't really agree with it
we don't damage it I collect old games
and stuff but in my opinion they're
there to be played yeah see that's a
philosophical thing though that a lot of
collectors like okay so this is this is
I hear like I I know that there is a lot
of people that view it this way I just
don't personal so the stupid tangent um
my one of my wife's friends daughter is
turning one okay and so Yvonne is
getting for her daughter something
that's really for her mom because like
what does the one-year-old do with a toy
eat it and she started collecting Polly
Pockets do you remember Polly Pocket and
mighty max oh you're younger than me I
know I know like people that I knew were
you wrong people that I knew were into
it I wasn't I don't know about like kids
my age were into that stuff okay fine so
anyway just just for like for balls
she's started collecting Polly Pockets
and she has a little like thing for them
and stuff and I was looking into it and
Polly Pockets and Mighty Max for that
matter are one of those toys where I can
legitimately see how the field one would
have a lot more value than the non field
one because the pieces are so small and
there's it's really hard to track down
exactly what they're supposed to come
with but it's a lot of value to sell yes
so tell me what if I bought it to play
with it so if you not to sell it if you
collected Mighty Max let's say for
example okay no what no let's say you
collected Polly Pocket not judging I'm
just sure thing no let's call me what
you would play either way would you buy
something would you collect something
like that to sell or would that be more
of just ladies I mean he's like if I'm
away collecting it to sell then in my
opinion that's a business what if you
collected it just to own it because that
was one that I would want to do
something with it you would want to do
something want to play with my little
Polly so you would take it out of the
package even if it's just to like put it
on a nice display case and like create
like a little like and I feel like and I
have done that because I have I
the Halos Master Chief helmet understand
that's out of care package again statue
thing from Skyrim okay I have soldier 76
I have master sword in a stone
I have the chick from horizon zero dawn
I have a few little statue a kind of
thingy that right kind of around my
house I think they look really cool if
they were in their box it would be the
game box or plain white foam okay all
right fair enough which sounds super
lame honestly looking at these mighty
maxes and Polly Pockets man I think
there is a legitimate business model
there of just buying like like actually
huge Kwanzaa I'm like that's of like
every way
go ahead but like I'm the person that's
buying it and then using it right cuz
like if you want to buy it to resell it
sure nostalgia man like as my customer
darling I was nostalgia of a Pippin yeah
I guess that's a fair point like a
maximum of 42,000 people if everyone
loved it yeah and I like pretty much
guarantee that's not what happened so
I'm kind of thinking okay this is our
next but we just forget it forget this
Linus Media Group thanks group hey you
and I just no one else is listening
right normal moment oh okay so you and I
are going to go into business okay we're
just going to find cheap storage space
nice and everything someone's probably
sewing there's no that we're out of it
right right okay every new stupid crappy
trend you know we buy like a pallet of
it perfect okay we buy a pallet of it
users store it all Indiana Jones
warehouse style okay and then we just
wait for 20 years because I do not like
sealed Polly Pockets going for like 80
100 bucks yeah we're talking a 10x
increase in value over 20 years
that's actually a not pretty and bad
return I bet you just gotta nail it
every time you don't even have to if you
get it right
half of the time you can probably flip
it for something the other parts of the
time exactly it's like you know it's a
really good business model right now
actually would you share kind of writing
Tecna is making like advertising more
aggressively and getting better SEO
using trendier websites than companies
that are actually doing what they're
supposed to be doing and just buying
knockoffs from China like there was this
new bra thing that's like kind of a
sticker and then you pull the thing in
and it pulls I don't know how it works I
don't get it oh it was like that looks
plush up bra right yeah yeah there was a
lot of online pop-up shops that happened
and it's essentially like little mall
kiosks but on the Internet
and they just pop up with crazy SEO they
advertise through like Facebook and
YouTube super aggressively here like
really really aggressively so that
they're always in your newsfeed and
you're just like oh I've seen this
advertised everywhere I guess that's the
one that I've seen that people are
talking about I guess I'll just buy that
one and you may get something if it's
just super generic you just buy a crap
ton of them ship them over on like a
drop ship and then just throw up a whole
bunch of different you could even have
one company that just has like a hundred
websites there are a lot of like skeevy
crappy ways to make money aren't there
yeah some people are bringing up fidget
spinners in the twitch chat and honestly
here's what I would kind of tell you
because I think they were being kind of
sarcastic but here's the thing and some
of you might not be old enough to
appreciate this yet but nothing is as
good now as it was when I was a kid and
I actually mean that objectively wagon
wheels would be a perfect example candy
that was delicious and tastes like utter
trash now but like there's actually been
changes to the recipe yes honey nut
cheerios are another example when I was
like six they were awesome avoid them
they killed honey nut cheerios yeah like
poor marques who loves his honey nut
cheerios so much has never even tasted
honey nut cheerios had the good old days
ones okay so anyway here's what will
happen with something like fidget
spinners they'll come back but they'll
be crappier so if you bought a bunch of
cheap ones today that would be a bad
play
but if you bought a bunch of like
premium and specialty ones like a bunch
of like cool ones or ones with like a
timeless branding like I don't know if
Pokemon is timeless but something like
ah man I don't know about like Toy Story
but like like like Gundam branding like
some kind of really resilient anime or
something like that a really
high-quality one from like a reputable
maker a pallet or two of those would be
worth a gold mine 20 years old I'm sure
the owners even like a dude perfect ones
no I okay nothing against dude perfect
but I wouldn't bet on any youtuber
including ourselves these are two
short-lived it's potentially to
flash-in-the-pan through um and you look
at every youtuber has what I call the
curve where they go yeah they go like
sorry I'm going to go across your face
because I was writing behind thing where
they go like this everybody grows really
slow at the beginning because that's
that's the nature of the algorithm and
then they grow and then they plateau and
then they decline and sometimes it's a
slow decline and sometimes some comeback
Phil DeFranco iJustine these are
examples of creators that that bucked
the curve and and you can also just kind
of flat yeah and then manage come back
up again and again flat and then you'll
go up again and then you'll fly yeah but
that curve I've seen it so many times
and there can be a thousand reasons not
got into TV yep just lost their passion
team fell apart
got bored yet decided to form a an MCN
didn't adjust with the current like meta
didn't adjust that means they're fun
nails I just didn't care anymore like
there's a thousand reasons why people
fade off the platform but I have seen
very few examples of turning your
platform success once you are no longer
supporting the YouTube audience into
some kind of actual sustainable off
platform success
I think Harley from Epic Meal Time would
be an example but I
do you have to wonder if his fortunes
today would actually be even better if
you had stuttered YouTube for longer
because YouTube is kind of like the
investment phase of a modern web video
production business it's like it's like
where you're burning money it's like
when you got your seed funding and the
see the funding might just be your own
time yeah but that's where you're
investing into the business and you're
growing the audience and then there's
like a monetization phase where people
might try to go off platform or they
might try to US soldiers open a merge
store their nitrite or they might try to
do PewDiePie as mobile game where they
try to monetize in other ways if
PewDiePie spent all his damn time on his
mobile game then the plateau would
happen because the YouTube audience and
investing into that audience and growing
it is how you open up new opportunities
for all that other stuff down the line
yeah and basically the second you stop
focusing on YouTube that's where you
start to see a decline
generally speaking some people are like
uh this guy because you didn't like call
them out like yeah it not the point
yeah the point isn't any particular
individual right now this is this is a
greater observation about the platform
yeah um
anyway feel like we've gotten a little a
little off topic this was supposed to by
mr. troll on the forum the original
article has Delta from W CCF Tech so you
can take it with a grain of wucf tech
but AMD is rumored to be building once
again a dual AMD top-of-the-line GPU
card which would surprised me a lot but
apparently they're going to throw a
couple of Vega 10x T's on a single
graphics card really Wow only nearly 600
watts of power draw because yellow
oh um Wow I would recommend not buying
it
if they make it like directly and that's
the end of that chapter over 50
teraflops of SP 16 compute 25 teraflops
of FP 32 compute so this thing is like
it's almost like a workstation card
except that they're going to Ares gamer
brand it out to the ninth it's 600 watts
per single card you know and you just
put two the power supply makers have to
be just giddy right now oh yeah because
for the first time in quarters a 1500
watt power supply might actually be
necessary like I'm serious if you went
18 from what I'm hearing
rumor is an 18 core core i9 but who is
doing this just hold on
that's what I don't know know that
that's what I don't understand these new
processors that everyone's pushing in
the consumer space are not consumer
processors I do it like I don't
understand why everyone like unread and
all this kind of stuff
it's freaking out over these processors
who's why are you buying are you buying
this why are you buying this it's not
for you it's not for me okay well it is
anyone care okay now you could have used
a computer with that much wattage before
you just bought server part okay let me
go let me go
I'm a lazy finish but now let us go
ahead it's just so stupid I don't I
don't know it's a chicken and egg thing
though will we ever get software
development that is really and truly
honestly multi-threaded if it doesn't
come to the high end I think we're going
to wait for clumps and eventually
trickle down I think we're gonna wait
for Chrome to consoles yeah but it's got
to start somewhere so can we be excited
just for the beginning at night even if
we don't I is like all this helmet
that's true but Knights corner didn't
have single threaded performance like
these new ones do it's true because
they're like there
that every go when people are like like
that one's too expensive it's like are
you gonna buy the other one is that one
more affordable this is the happier
chill in the red I need you product
right now okay but think about it this
way - what about the youth market three
years from now use market on the $2,000
profit yeah it but it okay it would be
like you know 600 bucks
cuz we've seen the curve in three years
yeah before there would be cheaper at
least the process is finally starting
because here's the thing for the power
supply makers for all this time they've
had a product that you have no
legitimate bear baits they tried to be
the first one out so they're like
everyone else can now make things that
need water so ever
there were no there was no upgrade path
at all yeah whereas now there is
legitimately okay when all of my baller
friends get tired of their Vegas 64's
and buy something more efficient
probably and there and there you know
core i9 because word on the street is
like overclocked you could be looking at
hundreds II not a couple hundreds of
watts through 18 core core i9 through
the socket okay so you know I could buy
this stuff for pennies on the dollar and
have legitimately a baller ass gaming
machine but I but I need a ball a power
supply for so like scrapyard wars 2026
is going to be bangin
yeah pretty much and and and like the
one thing that we're going to make sure
that we invest in this time is a good
power supply yeah like a really good one
yeah yeah um what else we got here
Paris is apparently considering eSports
for the 2024 Olympics which I like iifa
tackle I've defended eSports on the LAN
show against you for years and I think
this is so dumb yeah I would be down
with there being like an eagle in this
sure but that should be like it should
be like okay and don't take this the
wrong way or for me but it should go
Olympics Paralympics and then Olympics
because quite frankly even if you just
see it as like this one into the gate
the audience overlap is like negligible
yeah probably
you could run them at the same time no
cuz then I think that's like oh okay
think about like you know households
with one screen you know okay yeah yeah
yeah Junior doesn't want to fight with
Grandpa over you know who's got the TV
yeah um but you know what do we got here
they'll consider an inclusion as a medal
event according okay Louie you got to
read this quote you hask you right there
we have to look at it because we can't
say it's not us it's not about Olympics
and the next word they use yes they are
interested in eSports in this kind of
thing let's look at it let's meet them
let's try and see if we can find some
bridges the youth they like they like
the electronics we need to find a way to
incorporate it so that the users are
interested oh my goodness all right ah
this was supposed to buy the Beast PC on
the forum the original article is from
Tom's guide this is apparently what the
iPhone 8 looks like it's an iPhone 8
dummy unit and it's a video
gangnet it looks like a more country
looks like a Marquez video I like that
that carpet right there that noodle
doesn't have is that thing that I told
them to put on it when I inspected his
studio um okay I don't see how that goes
hi wow I can't actually believe how much
I hate this really I don't mind it oh I
think because the screen extends on each
side of it caravan I think it's just a
way to get more screen real estate
because you have like little
notification things up there like your
battery state
stuff is in line with the camera I don't
mind it at all personally that I really
hope that's not the touch sensor on the
back that is pure cancer right in the
middle is my ring I don't yeah or me I
didn't thanks huh I thought it was up a
little bit ah no you might be right
actually that might be closer to the LLG
approach I mean I'm not remember without
my phone on me
Wow I actually don't remember the last
time I was that not caring about a I
thought apparently it's not in the
middle at all oh yeah okay I'm sorry
apparently it'll have wireless charging
it'll still have a camera bump on the
back and this is ridiculous okay this is
supposed to by snorting frogs on the
forum we have been hounding Seagate to
let us play with their 60 terabyte SSD
since they announced it like a year ago
they still haven't gotten one to us and
now they announced a 64 terabyte nvme
SSD gosh darn it you guys know I'm real
upset now I'll just ask for this one
instead there you go
Disney to pull their content from
Netflix this is originally from
Bloomberg this is a big deal actually
yeah so the happy ecosystem that we're
you just pay one flat fee and you get
pretty much all the content that you
could want is getting fragmented so much
for the idea of pulling the plug or
cutting the cord or whatever it's called
a tide commercial so much for cutting
the cord and being able to get pretty
much everything you want for like 15
bucks a month in 4k it is you're going
to have to start building your own cable
package the way you used to subscribing
to a bunch of different services and
there is a huge gap that is that just
got formed in the market for someone
who's the aggregator who's like okay but
basically a cable network you know the
online cable network is coming where
they're just like our platform where you
buy your your Disney
and your Netflix and your other packages
you view it all in one space and it uses
all the API is to bring together a nice
little thing or words what can be put I
think the TV makers are gonna jump on
them do you think there's gonna be like
a sim I think Google could jump on this
yeah I think Samsung is going to try and
do their own thing with Tizen I think
you're like Google might fail I think I
think Google is going to try to do it
through YouTube and people are going to
want I don't think they will I think
they're going to do it through devices
like the Nvidia shield TV because
remember too that there are TV
manufacturers including Sony
that bake full Android experiences into
there too yeah yeah but there's people
that want this on their laptop the trend
of like yeah it's like the university
girl watching that books all the time on
her macbook it's like that's on her
macbook not on her TV it would be
interesting for flex to go after it I
don't think Plex would have the I don't
think Plex would have an ago I don't
think they'd have a seat at the
negotiation team come on Plex further
but some of their support of piracy all
these years they're like who or don't
support piracy but support a piracy for
all these years I don't think they win a
chance to talk about this interesting so
I'll be interested to see where this
goes but one way or another Disney
pulled their catalog from Netflix they
will stop supplying Disney and Pixar
branded movies starting in 2019 and
launch an online product of their own
going directly to consumers this is part
of the reason why Linus started it and
I've been doing it for a little while
now I've been like collecting when they
go on crazy sales on Amazon blu-ray
copies of yep movies and TV shows that
I'm personally really interested in
because like yep oh yeah it's on Netflix
then it might just disappear on who
knows I'd like to be clear I said I'm
still going to have a Netflix
subscription and I do as well but the
blu-ray does look a lot better if you're
a big snob and if you're like a crazy
fanatic of a certain show or movie
there's extras and some are really cool
I really like commentary yeah that's one
of my things I've always really liked
like one of my favorite things ever was
the making of DVD for I think it's halo
2 or halo 3 I remember which one that
was amazing
I love making of things and I love
commentaries I really like interviews
with producer sectionally yeah like
honest vessel
the making of usually how the interviews
with Larry David on the on the Seinfeld
complete collection that I got it I got
at Costco like so cheap is awesome
that's the thing you type them on sales
don't buy them at full price that are
really expensive like HMV shut down and
I got like six seasons of Game of
Thrones my gosh I was still I'm still
not watching but like I know I'm going
to watch them I got like a bunch of
seasons of Walking Dead six seasons no I
thought I think four seasons of Game of
Thrones like six of Walking Dead which I
still want to watch haven't even started
it yet but yeah so so uh apparently
they'll continue the relationship with
Marvel Marvel TV I got bill out
excellent adventure and Billa Ted's
bogus journey in a combo pack for like
$5 or something which was awesome oh oh
okay now this might be a case of picking
studies based on confirming your own
bias but this is off TechCrunch
apparently the some study finds and I
haven't looked at their methodology at
all but this is just funny to me because
honestly I think fitness trackers are
the stupidest most useless fad of all
time against them um and they were both
very for like echo Sentinel health and
exercise and taking care of yourself I'm
about that if you have to like track
your steps you're really not doing it
right yeah so Fitbit apparently turns
teams off exercising wah-wah has to do
with pressure from pressure from
competition with peers encouraged in-app
leaderboard and also all the other
things that are like push push push
compete against this other person only
work for short term style motivational
effects or and this is the other thing I
believe that fitness trackers are great
for people who were already going to be
ripped as hell and exercising all the
time anyway like it's one of those
things where I don't see the fitness
tracker as a as a solution if you're
only going for steps yes that's another
thing they mentioned here the uncomplete
lean on personalized 10,000 steps per
day target was cited as unfair and
pressurising goal generating feelings of
guilt or lack of ability among users
like if you're working on it
it's really different like very
difficult for you to get 10,000 steps a
day and you just feel like you're
failing all the time to even like 9,000
steps but you're like really trying so
what I met that's terrible I don't even
know how to check it on you know oh crap
I legitimately actually don't know how
to check on here I never use the Apple
watch so it's like I I should just
switch to a watch
exactly yeah I've said that for a while
to start sharing your activity sync to
the iPhone yeah I don't even have it
sing to my phone right now
um gamers Nexus tests the knob to a fan
rumors so we'll post the original
article here in the twitch chat already
Oh alrighty then I knew you're gonna go
into this next um they tested
differences including appearance noise
and effectiveness and the online
community was quick to crap on noctua
about this but it turns out the
differences in the tooling we're mostly
to do with just not just having two
separate sets of molds at two different
locations and two separate facilities
that have different capabilities and
tuning that took place between creating
an original mold in a later mold and
their quality standards haven't changed
at all I was informed by Noctua that our
LPT Edition fans were actually produced
in China alone and the NFA 14 has been
they were true yeah they were great the
NFA 14 I believe has been over there for
a long time but basically gamers Nexus
got a larger sample and debunked the
claims it was down to unit 2 unit
variability for the original posts and
basically it's all within margin of
error there's no difference between
China and Taiwan made fans except for
the appearance and Noctua has always had
issues with their color matching we've
got old Knox yeah and the cream is
closer to white and the brown is closer
to like a reddish brown or closer to
like oh yeah I particularly don't like
yeah in terms of color the newer ones
are not the video so there you go so
let's pretty much it for the LAN show
you have anything else to uh
don't police I can't talk about what I
did this week no I don't really believe
so it's been a long weeks on and get out
of here I actually have a bunch of stuff
I have to card up to the second story
over there after this anyway so okay all
right well see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel boy lots of
yours today
sixty-eight hundred almost 6900 man I'm
pretty sick that's pretty sick d900
alright I guess Limited is up right I
also noticed the kids once for these
comes with a whole bunch of replacement
ones so that even if you break the side
off you can strip with tax tape that's
actually pretty smart
okay now what's up with kids yeah
someone on their team has had a child</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
