so thanks again to LG for sponsoring
this little short was a shocking amount
of work for a mere two minutes of actual
runtime but project backpack was a lot
of fun for us to make and I hope a lot
of fun for you guys to watch the
inspiration actually came from the first
time that LG showed me the PF 1000 u
mini beam projector it's small and light
enough to be easily toted about and
thanks to its ultra short throw optics
you can do a 60 inch image from I think
it's 4 inches and a 100 inch image from
15 inches from the wall it can be used
pretty much well anywhere so since we
have access to this empty warehouse
right now I wanted to push it to its
absolute limits and an extreme darkness
we were able to get a usable image out
of it up to about 200 inches diagonally
which was exactly as cool as it looked
like in the video one thing I wish I'd
added is a Bluetooth sound bar because
it does support that natively if you
don't want to use the onboard speakers
or the speakers from your device but I
didn't get around to it which might not
be a huge problem because maybe you guys
can try it out for me we're actually
giving away two of these projectors to
two lucky viewers somewhere around the
world so check out the link in the video
description for the full details about
that while you're down there you can hit
the like and the subscribe buttons on
your way and you can also check out the
where to buy link where we'll have
pricing and availability all this
projector if you're not one of the lucky
winners thanks again for watching guys I
hope you enjoyed it leave a comment
letting us know what you thought of
project backpack get it
project backpack 5 internet stars if you
guys caught that before I said it just
now and I'll see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
