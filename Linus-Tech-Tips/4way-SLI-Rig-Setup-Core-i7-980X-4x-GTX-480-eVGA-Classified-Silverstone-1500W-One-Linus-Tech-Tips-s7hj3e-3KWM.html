performance numbers from the ridiculous
four-way SLI six core machine that was
built in recent NCIX tech tips episode
so just updating you on my progress here
I'm actually just installing the geforce
driver which you can see they did it did
it did it to do ads four-way SLI support
for the GTX 480 now for Wii SLI is
intended for world record performance
and requires non-standard power and
cooling it is not recommended for
general consumer configuration so
cooling may be a bit of an issue but the
half the high airflow maybe it'll be
able to handle it we'll find out and as
far as power is concerned that's a 1500
watt power supply if this can't handle
it then I don't know what can but one
thing if you come over here I'll
actually be able to show you now before
I actually load this machine up I'm
gonna have to move it somewhere where
I'm not relying on an extension cord
but at idle without even drivers
installed for the video cards yet we're
at 300 Watts that's idle on an 80 plus
silver power supply so I expect this is
going to draw a mean amount of power
under load</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
