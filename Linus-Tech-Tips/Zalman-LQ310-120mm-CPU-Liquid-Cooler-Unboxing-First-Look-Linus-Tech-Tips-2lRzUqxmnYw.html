the Zelman lq 3:10 this is an all-in-one
liquid CPU cooler has a built-in pump
with slim waterblock copper base of
microphones to maximize cooling
performance high-capacity radiator use
for high heat dissipation additional
120mm your fan can be installed durable
long lasting tubes environmentally
friendly anti-corrosion coolant and
slick seems to be bothered by the
plastic that is all over the package
because it makes it hard for him to see
anything because you know cameras and
plastic and reflections and all that
so we're come on you can do this line
you can do this so we are gonna get this
bad boy opened up and have a look at
what is inside
I am fully expecting to find a water
cooling unit inside although I could be
surprised it's a clone no it's a water
cooler okay so the first thing we see
here is the manual so this is for the lq
series shows us the compatibility LGA
2011 1366 11 56 1155 FM one am3+ a.m. 3
a.m. 2 a.m. 2 + FM 2 as well everything
so basically it's compatible with
whatever you want and has nice little
graphics here for how to install all the
various parts with great nice big
pictures and all that kind of stuff I
mean at this point these things are
these these prefilled liquid cooling
units are pretty prevalent out there so
you've probably encountered one at some
point or another all the mounting screws
and hardware that you could possibly
need for all the different sockets this
is the Intel backplate for 775 1155 1156
and 1366 Intel hold-down swappable piece
here AMD hold down AMD backplate and LGA
2011 is done a slightly different way
next up we've got the fan itself so I
personally wish they'd gone with a
different style fan for this particular
product you can see here there are only
mounting holes on one side which does
give it a cleaner look when it's
installed and I understand why they did
this because what this does do is it
decreases the potential interfere
with other stuff around the back 120
millimeter slot on your case see because
there's not these corners where you know
you might have stuff coming up here so I
understand why they did this but it does
not give me the option to put the fan on
the other side because I'm going to have
well I'm not going to be able to mount
it or I will be able to mount it but air
will leak around and I won't get optimal
cooling out of it you can see it also
has some shapeliness to it here which
presumably is for quietness or or some
kind of you know optimized reason but I
would have preferred to have that
mounting flexibility it is a pwm fan
however which is better than what most
people are including with these pre-dawn
water cooling kits so at least it'll run
very very quiet next we've got the
radiator itself so this is a slim
radiator which improves compatibility
with cases however if you're going for
maximum overclocks you're going to want
a thick radiator or a dual radiator
liquid cooling unit the bottom has a
high quality thermal compound pre
applied to it this is a full copper
water block including the copper fins on
the inside so you don't have to worry
about any corrosion or any kind of
nonsense like that not to mention it's
got an anti corrosive coolant inside and
we've got his almond logo on the top the
tubes are extremely high quality so you
can see you can twist those up as much
as you want so even if like its
installed here and your CPU socket was
like here you wouldn't have to worry
about the tubes kinking or anything like
that there's nothing kinky about this
particular water cooling product I think
that actually pretty much wraps it up
power for the pump is provided by a
three pin connector which is black
overall this thing looks outstanding
because everything's sort of black and
silver and it's gonna look great
installed in your system thank you for
