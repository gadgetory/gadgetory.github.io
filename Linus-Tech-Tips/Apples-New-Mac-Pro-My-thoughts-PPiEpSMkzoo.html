WWDC 2019 keynote but the biggest one
for us was obviously the new Mac Pro now
it's not often that Apple admits they
were wrong but that's essentially what
happened yesterday after five long years
of waiting for professional users who
simply weren't happy with the trashcan
so let's take a closer look at it and
see if we should be excited or if we
should stay far far away you know what
you shouldn't stay far away from our
sponsor I fix it ever wonder why you're
always missing a screw when you put
something back together I fix this
magnetic project Matt will keep you
organized and keep your screws in place
check it out at the link below
so right out of the great there's a
bunch of well great things sorry I'll
stop that now
about the new Mac Pro that I really have
to give Apple credit for first up is
their use of a mostly standard and even
more importantly reconfigurable tower
design according to apples figures it's
got a ton of cooling capacity it's
extremely easy to open and open it you
will because it's also got a ton of
expandability that's right count them my
friends that is 8 PCI Express x16 slots
with four of them being double width and
it's also got 12 RAM slots supporting up
to one and a half terabytes of six
channel ddr4 memory and on top of the
seriously impressive amount of internal
expansion you get a pair of front
Thunderbolt three ports with more of
those on the back as well as dual 10
Gigabit Ethernet network ports whoo but
let's slow down for a second and break
it down a bit starting with the cooling
both the CPU and the GPU coolers are
passive in this design meaning that
Apple is relying on direct airflow from
the three chassis fans at the front of
the tower now that's kind of unorthodox
but it's also not unexpected after
apples emphasis on decoupling their
active coolers and their passive heat
sinks on the trashcan Mac Pro's and if
it works then well that's really cool
the only rub that we have right now is
that there's no mention anywhere of
filtration which means that if there
isn't any and so far Apple does not have
a great track record for this dust is
gonna get sucked in and it's gonna
settle on the components over time
hurting cooling making matters worse
it's impossible to tell right now how
good of a seal is made with the outer
fascia so the sides might also be a
point of ingress for dust and debris as
well as potential sources of noise
escaping the chassis with that said the
ease of opening the new Mac Pro
we'll make it a much more trivial task
to clean compared to traditional Apple
products so all this might end up being
a total non-issue on the subject of
opening it up let's talk about the
expansion slots the only really obvious
gotcha here is that the topmost slot is
limited in length by the CPU cooler but
if you dig a little deeper you will find
some more with the Radeon Pro Vega to
GPU option the passive cooler or coolers
you can have up to two of those are so
large that they obstruct their adjacent
PCIe slots in spite of the double
spacing so that's gonna drop you down to
six or four other available slots
depending on your config so there is
another compromising utility for the
sake of keeping all of the internal
cooling passive it's not all bad though
because those same Apple stock GPUs come
on a new extended PCIe slot design that
they're calling Mac Pro expansion or MPX
for short it's basically like two PCI
Express slots lined up right next to
each other now the front of the slot the
PCIe 16x part hasn't been modified so
you can actually install anything that
you want in there but that raises the
question what's the rest of it for so
apparently it's for power delivery that
means up to a total of 500 watts per
card with no messy cabling and routing
DisplayPort connections to the internal
thunderbolt ports now something that's
nice is that if you'd rather install a
non apple card there are actually
auxiliary eight pin PCI Express power
cables which give you up to 375 watts
per slot just like a normal PC honestly
that's pretty thoughtful of Apple even
though they still haven't made nice with
NVIDIA something that might have saved
them the trouble of engineering an FPGA
to accelerate video decoding you know
just pop in RTX in there right anyway
until that happens the afterburner card
will actually handle offloading up to
three
8k ProRes Ross dreams or 12 4k ones from
the CPU so in fairness to Apple that is
pretty sick but we'd still really like
to see them get on patching things up
with Nvidia because as nice as those
dual Vega 2 options are they're not
comparable to Titans or quad rose or are
they actually there's a huge amount of
capability here and we're pretty excited
about these GPUs because a couple of
them combined with AMD's ultra-fast
infinity fabric offer nearly as much
bandwidth as nvidia zen d-link as we've
seen on their r-tx series of GPUs and
since there are no multi-gpu single r-tx
boards available right now and envy link
can currently only combine to
workstation cards that means that the
dual vega 2 cards if you have two of
them with a total of 4 32 gig frame
buffers are the only way to achieve the
massive 128 gigs of combined vram that
Apple has assembled here so for
professional rendering or animation
workloads while an artist could throw
for Titan r-tx cards or for quadrant II
x8 thousands they still wouldn't have as
much combined memory making the upcoming
Mac Pro the only non enterprise solution
for working on positively massive scenes
in professional rendering or huge data
sets for DP GPU tasks and much more than
that
oh and all of this is with HP m2 memory
for even faster access times than GDD
are 6 like I'm really looking forward to
seeing the numbers for these monsters
not that I'm sure which monster exactly
to order Apple spec sheet for the new
Mac Pro also has a lot to unpack because
it's pretty weird and we're not sure how
to interpret some of it so first up is
the four memory sticks on the 32 gig
spec
machine is that because they're just
gonna leave a couple slots empty and you
can fill them yourself or is it
something else are they using multiple
motherboards for the Mac Pro with LGA
3647 on the high end with six channel
memory and then LGA 2066 with quad
channel memory on the lower end actually
for that matter why even have a low end
why do they need the 16 core and below
skews as long as the iMac Pro exists or
even just I don't know at all by the
time you're spending that much money
why would you do that it's probably the
second most perplexing thing about this
whole announcement is the base model
with its eight core 60 and thread CPU
that I guess would be some kind of
variant of a xeon w21 45 ish which is
far from a professional level cpu in the
face of consumer chips that have that
many cores running at much higher clock
speeds it's one of those scenarios where
the only real advantage to this pro
product is ECC memory support and
avx-512 instruction set support which I
guess also brings me to I wonder why
Apple didn't leverage their relationship
with AMD for access to their thread
Ripper or epic lineup of CPUs instead it
could be that there's an exclusivity
agreement or it also could be that
they've just had this design in the
works for so long that thread Ripper
wasn't a feasible option yet it's hard
to say right now but we would like to
find out for you guys before we work on
our review later this year for now let's
change gears from the Mac Pro to the
accompanying new Pro display XDR this
thing is an absolute beast
I guess at $5,000 it better be but man
it ticks all the boxes short of high
refresh rate we've got 6k resolution
10-bit color factory calibration
proofing modes in standard def HD p3 HDR
srgb and more
1,000 it's sustained brightness with a
peak of 1600 nits I mean guys this
monitor for pro work yes and it's just
over an inch thick with a nine
millimeter bezel yeah that's a bit thick
but like guys you're also getting three
USB type-c ports and a magnetic latch
mount for the pro stand or a vase amount
which are both sold separately this is I
don't think I'm the only one who feels
like at five thousand dollars for this
display Apple shouldn't be NIC lling and
dining like this
the Beast amount adapter will be $1.99
and the pro stand $9.99 and like the Mac
Pro they'll all be available in this in
the fall though in fairness it's not
really nickels and dimes we're talking
about here the monitor doesn't seem to
come with a stand at all and the prost
end is a whopping $1,000 for a stand
thank goodness it includes the cleaning
cloth because lord only knows what
they'd want for that I guess this leaves
us pretty well into the other thing that
I've got to address apples had this
pattern for a while now but their
computers actually aren't all that
expensive compared to piecing together
the exact same spec list for yourself
yeah you might not make the same
hardware choices so there's definitely
ways that you can save a buck compared
to buying a Mac but all things
considered most base model Mac's
to say nothing of the high cost for
upgrades haven't been that big of a
ripoff well I wish I could say the same
thing here but unfortunately from what I
can tell apples decided to throw that
informal tradition to the wind this time
around and charge an extortion eight six
thousand dollars for the base level Mac
Pro now that wouldn't be a problem if it
had the horses to back it up but just to
recap that
$6000 mac pro is an eight-core 16 thread
cpu a pedestrian 32 gigs of ram a 256
gig SSD what year is it and a Radeon 580
X sorry I think it's a Radeon pro 580 X
isn't it ok sorry excuse me even so we
can do some paper math here so Z on W
21:45 for 8 gig sticks of ECC memory
high gig 256 giving nvme SSD but we're
looking at about $3,200 all in so is a
system bristling with Thunderbolt 3
ports and running Mac OS worth nearly a
$3,000 markup
let's put this into perspective this is
Apple's most expensive Mac Pro ever the
g5 started at 2 grand the 2009 Mac Pro
is 2,300 and the trash can started at
$3,000 even adjusting for inflation it's
nearly double the price
I mean maybe Apple needs to make back
there rd no definitely Apple needs to
make back their R&amp;amp;D but part of me
wonders if they just cynically think
that the people who want these are gonna
buy them at any price anyway I hope for
apples sake that they're right since
given their usual upgrade pricing the
top spec one is unlikely to be a better
value option so the baseline price for a
Mac Pro setup with the pro display XDR
is going to be $11,000 12,000 for your
display so we're gonna buy one but it
won't be until we've spent some time
with it that we can draw any sort of
conclusion about whether it's actually
worth the price
we do have some guesses though
speaking of guesses you probably guessed
