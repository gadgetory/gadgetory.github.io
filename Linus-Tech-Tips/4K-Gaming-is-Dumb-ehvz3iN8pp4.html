are pretty clear part of the pun all you
have to do is consult the product page
for any 4k monitor and you'll be treated
to the same stock imagery that has been
used to sell higher resolution displays
for the last handful of decades except
for one small problem
a human being with 20/20 vision can
discern about one sixtieth of an
arcsecond so that's about three thousand
six hundred increments per degree of
their field of view that means that you
would need to be two and a half to three
and a half feet away from a typical
monitor before the pixels become
indistinguishable from each other
Apple brands this as retina now with a
4k display you could get as close as 1.7
feet for a 27-inch model but how far do
people actually sit from their monitors
is any of this even a benefit why don't
we find out
privacy keeps your money safe by
creating secure virtual cards and
completing checkout forms for you saving
you time and money while masking your
card details sign up and immediately get
five dollars at the link below
would you would you game at this
distance it like this it's like 17
inches see it's about 22 to the laptop
mmm would you leave back that far while
you're gaming 21 what the hell's going
on what is this ah okay well we'll get
back to you on that okay so as of right
now it's looking like basically everyone
in our office would experience a
noticeable difference between 1080p and
1440p and about half of the people in
our office would experience a difference
between 1440p and 4k however there is
something that we're missing here and
that is anti-aliasing this technology
takes neighboring pixels and kind of
blends them together and it can make a
display seem like it's higher resolution
than it actually is now physically
increasing the pixel count is naturally
better but good eh-eh
especially in games can take things like
power lines from being a blocky stayer
KC mess to a smooth arc and one of the
easiest ways to see the effects of AAA
is with windows text so here we have a
1080p monitor and by default in Windows
10 there will be anti-aliasing on the
text although if we turn it off you can
see that that's bad let's go ahead and
turn that back on there we go that's
better but it's not even close to our 4k
display over here you heard it here
first folks
higher resolution displays are
indisputably better for creating and
consuming text content but games aren't
a bunch of small static black lines
sitting on a white background
they have motion and your eyes are often
moving around as well so how much of a
difference does that extra sharpness
actually make to test this we grabbed
three gaming monitors with the major
sixteen by nine resolutions and with
each of them locked to 60 Hertz with
anti-alias
turned on in our games we want to see if
our test subjects can tell the
difference
go ahead test subjects now we know that
our 1080p monitor is only a 24-inch er
and there's a reason for that that we'll
get to later it's still much lower pixel
density than either of the others so
it's fine for the purposes of our test
this is a drug that one's fair yeah this
one just died yo this one doesn't look
very good yep this one looks terrible
this one looks like it's a lower res
than this one but high anti-aliasing
which makes everything a bit blurrier
this one looks like native Reds with
some anti-aliasing III do think that one
still looks better to me but switching
back and forth to the east this one
looks really good as well
difference between these two is harder
this one's higher res though so that was
pretty much what we expected but here's
the thing all three of these gaming
monitors cost around five hundred
dollars and that is where we finally get
into the main point we're trying to make
in this video it would have been easy
for us to demonstrate that 4k doesn't
make sense if you don't have a lot of
money it's expensive
end of story but we're saying that even
if you could afford the gaming
horsepower to run 4k 60 Hertz and a 4k
monitor that's a predator monitors a
gaming monitor you would be better off
buying something else because there is
so much more to the gaming experience
than the pixel count
so these 1440p and 1080p monitors cost
so much because our 4k display is
running at 60 Hertz 60 refreshes per
second then these to run at a hundred
and forty four Hertz and a stonking two
hundred and forty Hertz respectively and
I've been a longtime believer that
refresh rate makes a way bigger
difference to the gaming experience than
resolution
so we're gonna get doom running on all
three of these and see what people
prefer to play on in a fast-paced
shooter this feels good you know it's a
game
it's looking good oh god I got it nailed
it okay hold on here hold on okay this
seems smoother I like this better than
that perfect got the glory kill bro um I
feel like that one feels better than
this one
yeah I don't feel like this is
significantly different from the other
machine same the same rail the same
what fascinating
what are you firing at this nothing I
can okay that's that's cool I may not be
the best person to ask but to me to be
honest I wouldn't care that much I think
this one you show me shows more heat no
I don't know they are the same like this
hay is motion blur on Nathan Lee if the
resolutions didn't stay between the two
can't tell you a goddamn thing the frame
rates like kicking up on this one well
we could tell you the frame rates about
180 FPS on here and what is going on
you're running on a 60 Hertz monitor
okay if I were going to game on
something it would definitely be this
just because it is lots of everything
the far left one actually in the real
estate but that clarity is not that
great overall image quality is worse on
this one but does it really matter
whether things are exploding in you're
just aiming at blobs so basically if
you're gaming in an even remotely
competitive way higher refresh rate at
least to a point is hands-down the way
to go those extra pixels are just not
worth the response time reduction and
the problem is that you can't have both
every display interface has a limit to
how many pixels it can push per second
which is why up until very recently
every 4k monitor has been capped at 60
Hertz making for an inferior gaming
experience outside of some edge cases
like the argument could be made for
gamers who aren't frame rate snobs that
that's a more pleasing experience or for
certain types of games that are more
about the cinematics and visuals whether
it's a Red Dead Redemption 2 or a Grand
Theft Auto 5 where you're not competing
against anyone you could make an
argument there for my part I wouldn't
touch that as long as that is an option
which I guess kind of leads into a side
rant here in the quest to have more
boxes checked off on the marketing
materials page many laptop makers have
even equipped their gaming models with
4k 60 Hertz panels either as an option
or even by default and while a higher
refresh rate can actually make you a
better gamer if the benefit of more
pixels is minimal on a 27-inch display
even our experienced gamer test subjects
hesitated being able to tell the
difference it's going to be way less
than that on a 15 inch or a 17 inch
even if you do tend to sit a bit closer
to your laptop now I'm sure there are
some of you wondering well what if I had
so much money that I could wear a
brand-new pair of Yeezys every day
could I have my cake and eat it too well
there are 4k high refresh rate monitors
like this one from a Seuss it runs at
120 Hertz or 144 overclocked it's got 4k
resolution and the HDR support is
practically a cherry on top by that
point I mean it's amazing and it's
better in every way than the 1440p
monitor that we were just looking at but
it still has a problem obtaining a
computer to put next to it that can
actually deliver all of those frames so
this right here is pretty much what you
would want for greater than 60 FPS
gaming at 4k and even it struggles to
get close to a hundred and forty-four
Hertz in the latest most demanding
titles it's got a core I $9.99 hundred K
to RTX 2080 Ti is running an SLI and a
bunch of other baller components like
it's freaking sick this is the best
gaming experience that I've ever had but
as much as I'd love to recommend that
everyone go and grab this set up it
doesn't make a whole lot of sense unless
you really do money for the tower and
the monitor you're looking at around six
thousand dollars worth of electronics
and not for you to have an excellent
1440p gaming setup with a gtx 1070 and
then grab two more for your friends so
they can have sick gaming setups too so
I guess this is the bottom line for
competitive play the higher the refresh
rate the better and for the affluent
enthusiasts the sweet spot is still
1440p 144 Hertz since you are still
getting the high refresh rate advantages
real competitive advantages along with a
nice clarity bump over 1080p are you
