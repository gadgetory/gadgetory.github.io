tutorials I'm going to be doing LGA 775
it's not the newest socket on the Block
in fact I'll be installing as my demo
today and let me see if you you're going
to be able to read this
yeah that's an Intel Pentium 4 630 it
runs at a whopping and I can't read this
through the camera so undoubtedly you
can't but it runs at a whopping 3.0
gigahertz it is a single core post ok
we're not going to go too far into that
now this is kind of an older board it's
an Intel 965 board but but I can still
show you the procedure except for the
removal of the protective cover over the
pins so if you want to know how to
remove the protective cover that goes
over the pins it's pretty easy just kind
of I'm going to mine it you pick it up
kind of like this and then you you pry
it up and then it comes off so unlike
the LGA 1366 and 11:56 ones which
actually sit under this the CPU cover
the LGA 771 actually sits over top the
whole assembly so it's closed when you
remove the cover ok so the first step is
to take the lever push it a little bit
away from the hook and lift it up
the next step is to press on this little
tab right here which will lift up the
CPU socket cover and expose 775
high-performance modern pins
okay so then much the same as the new
Mercer's intel has had already got had
this figured out quite a number of years
ago there are two little slots in the
side of the CPU and there are two
corresponding tabs in the socket so you
can see them here and here so we're
going to orient our CPU so that the
notches are right here and there okay
and then we're going to go ahead and
carefully put the CPU into the socket I
like to give it a little wiggle to make
sure it's in the right place then all
you need to do is cover it with this so
you can see the pressure is actually
from the bottom here and it comes right
down on the CPU here so that is where
the the force that's holding in the CPU
is actually coming from right here
makes contact with the integrated heat
spreader just like that so then you take
your arm and you can see that this is
where the pressure starts to come in on
the arm itself it's quite hard to push
down and this little bar right here is
actually making contact with this tab at
the end of the socket so you're going to
need a little bit of force it's okay
and so you push it all the way down get
it under the hook and there you go
you've installed your 775 processor the
force is alright that's the pressure
that's necessary to make sure that all
the pads on the bottom of the CPU are
making contact with all of the pins
inside the socket thank you for checking
out my LGA 775 CPU installation video
here it is again in fast motion just
like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
