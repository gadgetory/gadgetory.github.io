a product around here we still have to
acknowledge that the trade-offs made
some amount of sense I mean I'm sure
every engineer would love to make the
thinnest most powerful coolest and
quietest laptop with the best battery
life but the real world is full of
compromises there's one segment where we
feel like all of the technology is there
and someone just needs to have the
stones to build it so I present to you
our vision for the perfect gaming TV
the Corsair one features a compact form
factor that is fast quiet and you
guessed it compact check it out through
Amazon or Newegg at the links below
let's kick this off with a little
disclaimer this won't be a cheap TV this
is our concept for what would be the
flagship of our gaming TV lineup so from
here any TV manufacturer watching hi TV
manufacturers could create value options
with some of our ideas cut out the first
crucial feature for our gaming TV is low
input lag modern TVs run powerful
processors and in many cases even full
Android computers in them with enough
power for everything from 4k HDR Netflix
to complex near real-time image
processing and yet any cheapo monitor
that I grabbed off the floor in the
office will have lower input lag than
almost any TV on the Shelf at the store
and there is no good reason for it
I've heard it directly from a large TV
maker that they intentionally leave a
lot of processing on even in game mode
so that if stupid end-users watch movies
in game mode the image will still have
that Instagram filter vividness no so we
would be using an OLED panel for CRT
like pixel response with a processing
delay like the best gaming monitors of
one to three milliseconds and game mode
would run a simple srgb color profile
with factory calibrated accurate colors
speaking of responsiveness once you've
used a high refresh rate display for
gaming there's really no going back
so our TV's electronics would be capable
of driving its 4k panel at 4k 60 Hertz
or at 1080p at a higher refresh rate 120
Hertz would be okay 144 or 165 would be
better and we'd also want to build in a
mode where you can choose to interpolate
the reduction in resolu
or use 1 2 4 pixel mapping for similar
sharpness to running at native
resolution with basically just bigger
pixels we'd also throw in support for
both g-sync and free sync which can be
done if you're willing to use two
separate input modules but to fit those
in along with some of the other features
we want to add we realize that some of
the thinness will have to be sacrificed
though I honestly feel these days like
most people wouldn't care that much
about an extra inch for gaming I'd
rather have a TV that's thicker but has
the goods in it to be able to do away
with a standalone receiver so let's talk
inputs we want all of them first off
DisplayPort why is this not on TVs
already
it's a royalty-free connector with tons
of bandwidth and great support for
variable refresh rate just put it on so
ours would actually have two one for
g-sync and one for free sync and then as
far as HDMI is concerned for seems like
a pretty good number for the back
current gen consoles from the big three
and a set-top cable or satellite box
then oh we're not done yet for our older
inputs like RCA s-video component and
VGA our perfect TV would include a high
quality low latency video resolution
upscaler basically an integrated
framemeister we'd have one set of inputs
at the back for your favorite retro
console with another set at the front
for that ps2 or SNES that you only pull
out of the closet once in a while then
while we're at it another HDMI would be
nice and a powered USB hub for retro
controllers and charging VR gear would
be swell on to audio now we came up with
a really flexible solution for that it
should come with bookshelf speakers like
a Mackie CR 4 but ones that are mounted
to the side of the TV the audio signal
could be passed to them using contacts
on the side of the set so no wires but
we'd also want them to be able to be
easily detached
and repositioned using standard speaker
wires that way you could clip them on
discard them entirely or integrate them
into an aftermarket surround set up the
audio outputs for the rest of which
would just be good old-fashioned speaker
wire running on a high quality amp and
DAC along with RCA and Toslink if you've
got your own another no-brainer that we
haven't seen enough of easy pairing with
bluetooth headsets including support for
multiple discreet audio streams and you
would need that for our next feature the
PS TV had the ability to show a
completely separate full-screen image to
two players using 3d glasses but since
then with active shutter glasses and
OLED panels the potential for in-home
stereoscopic 3d has gotten much better
but I don't want to use it for stereo 3d
imagine this gamers you and your kids
are wearing the a glasses gaming on a
connected PC and speakers while your
wife and her friend wear B glasses and
watch 50 shades or whatever on their
headphones each side is losing half of
the vertical resolution but from my
review of LG's 2016 OLED the half
resolution experience at 4k is still
excellent
let's talk remote now then it would be
Bluetooth because anything else is kind
of stupid and also so that you could
easily use your phone as a remote
without a built-in IR emitter also it
would be pretty sick if it had a
built-in keyboard and could be switched
like some of the Logitech's keyboards to
control a PC as a gyroscopic air
keyboard like this one then just be
switched back to the TV on the subject
of using widely adopted industry
standards hmm what kind of stand would
we use maybe some kind of like weird
like two feet on one side no how about
facea why do TV manufacturers keep
reinventing the wheel here for both our
42 inch model which we think would be
perfect for a dorm or a bedroom
and our 65 inch model which is a great
large format size for the living room
without needing to be transported to
your house on a flatbed this solution
would allow the user to mount the TV
however he or she wants a couple final
housekeeping items while we're dreaming
RGB mood lighting on the back could be
controlled through the smartphone app
controlled dynamically using an
integrated dreamscreen controller or
over USB with integration with Razer
chroma and one small thing that would
make this TV much easier for use with a
PC would be the option to disable hdcp
2.2 on a given source I've had some
issues with it not allowing me to see
anything until the Windows driver loads
meaning no BIOS adjustments unless I go
grab an extra monitor so let us know
then in the comments is there anything
that you think we missed and do you guys
agree that if we're gonna be expected to
spend four to five thousand dollars on a
high-end TV well there should be an
option with features that are meaningful
for gamers because honestly I don't see
why the vast majority of what we
proposed couldn't be done for around
that price point or a little higher
Kasper is revolutionising the mattress
industry by cutting out the costs of
dealing with resellers and showrooms and
passing that savings directly to the
consumer so in a nutshell they're

through the night and I actually got my
new Casper mattress well I shouldn't say
one because we actually got two and it's
