to be unboxing it anyway because it is a
new product this is the Intel Core i5
760 and the i5 is not a new thing but
the 760 is so it's kind of half old half
new this is a quad core processor and it
does not support hyper threading but it
does support turbo boost so basically
it's just like the Core i5 750 but a
little bit faster so the actual stock
clock speed of the core i5 760 is as we
can see here 2.8 gigahertz versus the
2.66 gigahertz stock frequency of the i5
750 that's pretty much the only
difference it still got an 8 Meg - it's
still a Linfield class CPU so that means
that it fits in LGA 1156 but please note
this since it's a quad core and not a
dual core i5 processor it does not
support onboard graphics so if you have
an age 55 chipset motherboard you won't
be able to use the onboard graphics it
has a three-year warranty it includes an
Intel cooling solution which we're just
gonna okay we're gonna look at like that
so it's very thin very wussy with all
the core i5s especially the quad cores I
really do recommend getting a decent
aftermarket cooler from the likes of
Arctic cooling or Noctua or one of those
other good aftermarket cooler brands I
mean this will work but especially if
you're going to be doing any
overclocking I mean this is going to be
an overclocking champ because the only
real difference between it and the 750
is that it has a higher multiplier so
you're going to be able to take it
further with a lower overall base clock
you can see here the CPU has a bit of a
brushed metal look to it and you know
what this is something that actually we
had a complaint a little while ago about
you see these one two three four spots
and this I don't know if you can see you
certainly won't be able to see it in the
shadows here maybe if I bring this over
to the light you can see a faint square
outline can you see that in the camera
no I'll try different angles but you can
see sort of a line on the heat spreader
like this if you get it at a certain
angle I don't know yeah I all hope you
are able to see it but basically we had
someone complained that their CPU had
been opened because it had this mark on
it and it had some thermal compound
residue now my understanding is that
Intel actually tests these and that is
why they do have the marks on them and
they aren't they aren't pristine when
you take them out of a box so that was
just something I wanted to mention to
our viewers if you get an Intel CPU that
has a little bit of marking on it it's
not necessarily a problem on the bottom
there are 1156 pads where the pins on
the cpu socket make contact and thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the Intel Core i5 at 760</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
