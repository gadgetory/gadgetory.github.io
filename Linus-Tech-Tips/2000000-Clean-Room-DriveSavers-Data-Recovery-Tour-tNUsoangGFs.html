in there through those doors is one of
the world's oldest and most advanced
data recovery companies drive savers
headquarters here in Novato California
features almost a hundred employees
almost that many security certifications
and a two million dollar ISO five clean
room and they sponsored us down here to
have a close look at how it is they take
this and turn it in to this so let's go
inside
we're gonna kick things off in the
museum as long as our escort says that
that's okay security is a huge deal that
drive savers not just on the outside of
the building but also throughout it so
guests get these incredible badges that
actually change color over time
eventually turning red so that anyone
who sees it will know to kick me out or
call the cops and everything in here is
on a need to access basis with biometric
security on secure spots and annual
background checks for all staff members
so these guys have recovered data from
pretty much everything that you would
normally think of hard drives phones
laptops SSDs and from a lot of things
that you probably wouldn't think of
defibrillators photocopy machines and
even a TiVo so the museum here contains
many of their biggest success stories
both in terms of the importance of the
data that was recovered they once saved
Twisted Sisters Christmas album and
twelve episodes of The Simpsons
including the conclusion of the who shot
mr. burns cliffhanger during a national
contest to guess who did it and in terms
of the difficulty so run over by an
18-wheeler check lit on fire
check buried in a mudslide check that -
this one that you're looking at right
now was actually pulled from a sunken
cruise ship after sitting underwater for
two days it had the owner's memoirs
successfully recovered from it now let's
talk about how they do it consultation
and in some cases even diagnosis with an
analysis of what data they expect to get
back is free so you send in your drive
we're shipping sorts it into a colored
bin according to the priority of the job
and the cleanliness of the drive or
device and you might think to yourself
come on it's a hard drive
how dirty could it be but they've
actually had to obtain a Geiger counter
to evaluate the radioactivity of drives
coming out of nuclear disasters
and through some of their forensics work
they've even seen devices come through
here that were found on murder victims
one phone apparently had the camera
element gouged out before being placed
back on the victim's body in an apparent
attempt to get rid of the photos so yeah
drive savers got that back
good work idiot hope prisons treating
you well from shipping your bin travels
to one of a few different places and
we'll go through those in a minute but
everything will eventually get the
cloning treatment and that starts here
drive savers keeps a huge inventory of
spare wiped donor drives because you
dramatically improve your chances of
recovery if you're working with a bit
4-bit digital copy of your data set it
gives you the time to analyze more than
just what files were there and then dig
into who accessed them when what did
they do these kinds of things can be
particularly important in cases of
corporate intellectual property
protection for example where there might
have been some attempt to destroy data
or cover up a data access the folks in
this room also do the initial analysis
of raid arrays using software tools like
the one you're looking at here to
rebuild the array logically and
determine which drives are probably
working fine versus which ones will
likely need physical repairs before
making a cloning attempt and they've got
the hardware for everything from
reconstructing a four drive home Nazare
to this over here this is a 45 dr j baud
that's on standby waiting for i don't
know maybe another 96 drive server that
got gallons of water dumped on it due to
a sprinkler system malfunction because
yeah that was a thing that happened but
as you saw in the museum a lot of the
hard drives that come through here need
a lot more than a little bit of software
rika jiggering so welcome to the
cleanroom
or strictly speaking this is the
inventory room and the cleaner was on
the other side of the glass but but this
stuff's cool too in here they've got
basically every hard drive you could
imagine they've got two and a half
we've got three and a half inch they've
got Todd the latest helium sealed drives
and all the way from the latest to look
at these clunkers I mean look at this
this is called a mini scribe I guess you
know relative to this guy
it is pretty mini but basically the
point is whatever the text on the other
side of the glass inside that is o5
cleanroom so that is less than 100
thousand point one micron particles per
cubic meter ten thousand times cleaner
than a normal room whatever they need
they put a request onto this little card
it comes out here we load it up we fire
it back in there and whether it's a
brand new driver an ancient one they
start the process of rebuilding one
working drive from the donor and the
recipient
now they did put away some of the
proprietary equipment that they use for
example they found a way to work on
helium sealed drives which won't
function at all in regular air that's
seven times more dense and so they
wouldn't show us like I don't know how
they either reseal them or put them in a
helium chamber or something but this
place is still incredible so thanks to
the 34 filtered fans air is circulated
in here so quickly that it's not only
clean but they can actually do soldering
work anywhere in this room without
disrupting anyone elses sensitive
recovery operation incredible and an
operation it is they actually agreed to
let us do an actuator swap so stay tuned
for that video because I'm super stoked
for you guys to see it anyway for now
let's continue our journey so then with
the drive physically working
I mean it's copying data they can just
send it back to you right wrong so this
guy right here is working but it is not
reliable drive savers wouldn't be able
to keep their warranty approved service
status with every major hard drive
vendor for very long if they pulled that
kind of a
done so the next step then is logical
recovery where maybe not all but some of
the data should be recoverable even in
cases of severe physical damage like we
saw downstairs in the museum and we're
going to head over there but first we
need to make a quick stopover in flash
memory town now hard drive recovery is
complicated flash memory hole well
that's a whole other ballgame son so
what you're looking at here is raw ones
and zeros off a flash chip so you can
think of it kind of like a QR code
except that there is no app for your
phone to read it and making matters even
more difficult
this middle spare area part right here
well that contains information about
where the block numbers are where your
ECC belongs it's such a really good
stuff except oh wait that gets
intentionally scrambled in many cases as
a security measure so figuring out which
bytes are bad and getting the whole
thing to turn green takes a lot of
knowledge and then to do it quickly
takes years of experience and even
getting it to that point isn't trivial
in many cases flash memory chips require
proprietary not to mention expensive
readers and they come from devices but
don't always want to give them up easily
including everything from standard Apple
or MDOT to SSDs and computers to
camcorders mp3 players like what year is
it I know right and even bear flash
chips that are soldered on to the
motherboard
like in some of the latest Mac books
Thank You Apple and the craziest part is
coming back to device security again on
a device with a security module like an
iPhone for example so you can see in
this footage they're taking apart and
iPhone 10 for us that might later be
used as a known good for a customer
recovery attempt you could actually need
at least four components to even hope to
pull data off of it the NAND flash
itself which needs to be D soldered from
the board and
the baseband I see the controller which
you can actually see from this
disassembled AAA chip actually sits
under the RAM with context on the top
and bottom and the ROM so four parts
which means that if you were to hope to
pull data from a badly damaged one of
these you would need to desolder clean
reball and resolder
all of these four components
successfully to a donor phone and did I
mention by the way that even the couple
generations old a8 processor already had
1100 contact points so they apparently
haven't attempted an operation like this
with the ten yet but they think that it
might be possible finally we're in
logical land now stuff without any
physical damage to the hard drive itself
may end up coming straight here like
let's say for example you plug the wrong
power supply into your external drive
enclosure like this and it released all
of its magic blue smoke tella
he actually sent this drive to drive
savers four years ago but ended up
opting not to go forward with the
recovery service so as you can see from
what we pulled off of this drive it's
clear that for some people it's not
necessarily going to make sense
necessarily to pay for data recovery if
all you've got that's not backed up
somewhere is clips from a Cheech and
Chong live concert with that said even
around here at Drive savers where their
bread and butter is failed or corrupted
devices they still absolutely preach the
principles of data backup because the
cold hard truth is even if you are an
extremely skilled data recovery engineer
there are still things that can take out
your storage permanently so I think a
perfect example of that is our host
today Mike ended up losing pretty much
all of his data in the Santa Rosa fires
so even though he's an executive carrot
drive
Seavers there was nothing he would have
been able to do about that if he hadn't
had an off-site backup so at the end of
the day that's the takeaway guys make
backups of your data the three to one
principle should never be ignored but in
the event that something goes terribly
wrong drive savers has got your back I
want to thank them for making this video
possible I want to thank you guys for
watching and you can check out the link
to drive savers in the video description
yeah no no no I think I can I think I
can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
