the Apple G HD from Swift tech I spilled
some alfredo sauce on it but I assure
you that should not actually affect the
cooling performance of this particular
water block which is according to Swift
tech and I tend to believe them at this
point they kind of know what they're
talking about which is actually
apparently about two degrees better than
the Apple GXT Rev 2 which was their last
generation blocked that in my opinion
actually looked more ballin out than the
HD and that was partly because of the
metal construction which looked amazing
but was obviously costing them a fortune
to produce so it is apparently a couple
degrees better than that guy which was
already about as good as it gets I mean
there's only so much you can do at this
point to improve blocks that are already
pretty much cooling your CPU as much as
they can or however you want to say that
so included with the Apple G HD is a
couple things first of all you've got
mounting hardware for da-da-da-da-da-da
LGA 2011 which looks like is all that is
included with this particular version of
it although there are multiple versions
of Swift tech locks available note that
is not all that's included it looks like
it includes all of the Intel circuits so
that's that's outstanding so right here
is LGA him this looks like LGA
2011 and then the one that's actually on
it it looks like LGA 1156 or 1155 so
what I'd like to do is verify that
before I go any further and I knocked
out LGA 2011 doesn't need a backplate at
all so this is a 1366 backplate which
seems kind of redundant to include at
this point and then this is an 11 56
back plate so that is gonna work on 1155
as well which means you'll be able to
mount your Ivy Bridge processors on here
and then your sandy bridge-e processors
are just mounted on LGA 2011 using the
screw so those go right into the
backplate that's built right into the
board so why does the HD perform better
it performs better because of the base
plate design which we'll get to in just
a moment you can see I'm undoing the
screws here for the mounting mechanism
Swift Tek does such a good job of their
mounting mechanisms they are just sort
of perfect in every way
the screws are calibrated so that
they're putting the appropriate amount
of pressure on the CPU as long as you do
them up all the way so you just go until
it stops and that's pretty much it you
don't have to think about it beyond that
they also clip into place on the
hold-down plate that goes over top of
the block that doesn't change anymore it
used to be you had to swap those out on
blocks older blocks like the Apple G
Apple GGT now they just clip into place
using please come off thank you for that
they clip into place using little
retention clips right here so you can
pop those off they are reusable then you
pop on the LGA 2011 one and they will be
held into place so that means you don't
have to fuss around with them you don't
have to pop them through the back of the
board you don't have to do anything like
that you just put them in place hold it
on you actually can see these sticky
pads here you can actually take these
off stick this to the back of the
motherboard so it doesn't move and then
the whole process is actually simpler
than most of the those prefab liquid
cooling kits so there you go put that in
your sort of hat and wear it as a
feather or whatever else the case may be
so if tech has dramatically improved the
options that they have in terms
sittings over the last couple of years
so these right here are just your kind
of standard stubby fittings most
standard fittings because their Barb's
but they're stubby which means that
they're going to be sort of a less less
less of a straight stretch required
coming off of a block which makes it
easier to make curbs off of it
so the only thing to be careful of with
stubby fittings and with any fittings is
making sure that you're using an
appropriate mechanism to secure it so
you can see here we've got worm drive
clamps that are included with the block
these are not necessarily the easiest to
use but these are the safest way to
secure your tubing in such a way that it
is not going anywhere you can see the
size of them is appropriate for one half
inch ID 3/4 inch OD tubing which is what
most enthusiasts are using although
personally I'm more of a 3/8 inch tubing
advocate Swift tech includes a high
quality thermal compound it looks like
yeah we've seen this stuff before with
any number of labels on it yes it's good
stuff so there that's pretty much all
there is to say about that and the
obligatory test that there's a little L
on the bottom I'm gonna go ahead and be
narcissistic and assume that's for Linus
because this block is special for me now
it's probably not so the obligatory
finger test shows that it is extremely
shiny although it should be noted guys
that that is not necessarily the
strongest indicator of thermal
performance in fact it's it's not one
thing I would like you guys to check out
though actually if I can get the angle
change tool over here I need to go here
there we go so watch this you see how
the line of the table there actually
bends at the bottom see how it goes
like that and then at the top it goes
the other way this way the reason for
that is the base is gonna be slightly
convex so once you tighten it down the
copper will flatten and make the best
possible bond against the CPU IHS itself
the aesthetics of this block are
outstanding I mean we've again come to
expect this from Swift tech there are
two different options for Inlet and
outlet you can either go or rather
there's three different options for the
outlet and then there's one for the
inlet here so this is in and then the
way the block is structured inside it's
actually can come out here here and here
so that may
you can actually split it out to
different components directly from the
CPU block or you can use different
options if you want now it should be
noted that you can only use three
quarter-inch OD compressions on the
primary Inlet and outlet you can't use
them here but most people aren't going
to be using multiple outlets from the
block anyway so I wouldn't worry too
much about it there's a matte finish on
the hold down plate that looks
absolutely outstanding and you can see
here that you can actually move these
there you go back and forth so that is
going to cover your entire range of
Intel sockets if you do need AMD
mounting options they are available but
they are sold separately or as a
different block most people doing high
performance builds these days are using
Intel anyway so I agree 100% with Swift
X choice to not bother including the AMD
mounting kit because sort of 95% 99% of
people would probably end up throwing it
out so thank you for checking out my
