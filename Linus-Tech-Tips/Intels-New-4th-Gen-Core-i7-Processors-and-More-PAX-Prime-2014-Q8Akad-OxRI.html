to you by hyperx gaming products make
sure you click their logo to check out
the great gaming content on their
YouTube channel as well as phantom glass
the ultimate gorilla glass screen
protector for your mobile device so I'm
actually only here at PAX Prime 2014 for
one day because there is one booth that
has everything going on that I
absolutely had to cover so we're here at
until where they're launching not only
three new CPUs but also a brand new
chipset and finally they are launching
well actually I don't know if they're
launching that but they've got some PCI
Express SSDs over there as well that we
are going to check out so inside this
box right here is the all-new and I'm
going to try and get this right Intel
new fourth generation extreme edition
processor 59-60 ok whatever we're going
to call it has well II because that's
what I've been calling it for the last
six months already anyway and it's the
59 60 X this is an octal core and I
thought it was going to be awk dough but
apparently it's octal according to I 264
so there you go it's an octa-core
processor the front at three gigahertz
base and supports ddr4 memory running on
the x 99 platform that means that when
it comes to an absolute ultimate
performance machine whether from a
gaming perspective or from a content
creation or even from a workstation
perspective this is pretty much it of
course you're going to have to pay a
pretty penny in order to get that quad
channel ddr for support as well as
native support with no pci splitting for
up to 8 x8 x8 x8 X quad GPU operation
now the obvious question here guys is
what does anyone actually need an eight
core cpu for to which I would reply
great question because we can't no harm
doll come up with a different reason
actually aside from gaming where most
games are really limited to anywhere
from one to four actual threads of
utilization you could make the argument
you don't really need it but multi-core
has always been about multitasking even
when the first duel course came out I've
heard that same argument as time has
gone on wove as gamers we only need this
many course well it depends what you
want to do in the background so we're
actually going to have a
coming up soon we're not only will we be
streaming while gaming but we're also
going to look at can you render an
output video at the same time as gaming
when you have this kind of horsepower
now the extreme edition as always is
pretty darn expensive but don't worry
you're not locked into just that one
they've got the 59 30k as well as the 58
20k which are both sick scores now
completing what is in my mind the most
sensible CPU lineup that intel has had
in years you've got the mainstream
platform which is your quad core and up
two pcie 8 X 8 x4 dual card operation in
sli or crossfire X then you pay a little
bit more now and you get up to a 6-core
on a much more robust platform it is an
extremely exciting time and now we're
popping over to something that's not
actually a product release I mean this
is just the P 3700 it's gotten Intel
controller on it it's got a pci e 4x
interface it's got en el SI so that
enterprise-grade mlc nand on it and this
isn't new at all but i guess if we were
to kind of you know infer based on that
inside a consumer grade system you know
intel who's always so careful about the
positioning of the product well this one
is mainstream and this one is enthusiast
and this one is gaming they went and
threw this in what appears to be an
enthusiast gaming PC so maybe maybe we
can draw some kind of conclusion about
what the truly next-gen SSD platform is
going to be is it going to be SATA
Express is it going to be m dot 2 or are
we going to be looking at some kind of
product that's PCI Express base that
delivers enterprise-grade performance in
a desktop I guess there's only one way
to find out by the way I just I have to
do this they told me it doesn't work and
told me to throw it on the ground so um
if anyone's going to get in trouble it
should be this guy
alright guys don't miss any of our pact
prime 2014 coverage our trip to the show
is brought to you by hyperx as well as
phantom glass check out the HyperX
gaming channel on youtube so that's
youtube.com slash kingston hyperx
they've got some great content over
there and ask for phantom glass well
they make some pretty badass screen
protectors if we put one of those
gorilla glass screen protectors on this
SSD even if it was a working sample I
could probably drop it although I'm sure
until wouldn't be happy if I if I
dropped a working sample can i drop this
one I'm getting the no all right then</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
