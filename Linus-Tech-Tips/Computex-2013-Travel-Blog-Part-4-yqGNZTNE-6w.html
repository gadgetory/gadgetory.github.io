XCOM so be real and I had to stay in a
little bit this morning to edit and
while we stayed in we heard this huge
crackling noise I wasn't really sure
what it was but I was getting dressed I
wasn't too focused on it we heard
another huge crackling noise I want to
go look at the window and it's raining
like crazy and ever since it started
raining I've been feeling homesick and
that's probably the weirdest thing ever
when rain is what makes you miss home
it's because we live in BC so it's
raining all the time and now it's
raining like crazy and it feels like I'm
in DC except for what everything looks
like so yeah so we're in Taiwan as many
of you know and no matter how much a
thousand dollars feels like in new
Taiwanese dollars it's actually not that
much so we had about three grand and
b-roll and I blew through it really
really quickly on food in text taxi
rides I'm a little bit shaken up because
we just went to family marquees their
ATM I put my card in with Johnson more
money so that we could actually get
around cuz we want to go see duck you
today which I was pretty excited about
and it gave me the money give me the
receipt you did not give me my car I was
like I'm in a foreign country I can't
speak the language I was a kid but I
can't speak the language and there's my
cards jam inside of an ATM so I did two
or three fake transactions that I knew
wouldn't work because I used the wrong
options and then eventually it was like
receive your card and shot my card out
even though it said that three or four
times after doing fake transactions
finally it actually found my card out so
that was freaky still a little bit
shocking out over we're gonna keep going
we gotta get go see ducky so
I missed you so much Canada nothing is
so cool like if literally a sphere
carved out of the logs what does happen
I don't know I have no idea
like is totally signing his autograph
no but actually
but what just happened was these two
girls over there to take a picture with
them why I'm not completely
and then our nice hostess here for our
next to remote video also actually hit
the picture with them again I think it's
just that it's like as well maybe it's
just that he's super awesome I don't
know how much right now but most people
have them hang around their neck what
you do is you take the lanyard go to
your belt loop put in the first belt
loop the to the Sigma belt loop guy VLAN
dude put it through here boom instantly
pro I lift that for my brother after
going to PACs for quite a few years and
being a newbie entire time now I'm a pro
hey you guys have your Lantern
convention that's how you do so this
light blue tiki bakery for lunch and
guess what happened what happened place
oh so I give 10% off to people that are
going to coffee decks and as a pro I
wear my tag down here that's a new hero
wears his on his chest now I would like
to put a disclaimer before I go through
the rest of the thing this was very high
above the table and almost chest height
for most people that were serving me
just putting that out there but I didn't
get the discount because in English I'm
because they're only looking for it
around your neck so maybe you should
wear it this way no stretch you know
so it started raining randomly we walked
by someone giving out these bags and I
thought I would give be rolls camera a
hat because like this you can't see but
it's raining like crazy and as we have
very not that long ago had a lot of
problems with fs700 having getting
soaked and then almost breaking it does
really cool but everything here is slits
eyes
feels really long here this is your hair
actually touching that's awesome
part of our travel blog here this is
Albert from WD bye everybody
he has the freakin coolest car that
we've seen the whole time we're here
please
just yeah
I'm gonna get you to explain how you got
this like shiny silver back and out it's
awesome so basically this is a vinyl
wrap we've treated to have that chrome
effect the matte black is also a
stretchable vinyl it's very popular now
here in India and other part of the
world that people like to do a little
you know character into their car
you really need a lot of guts to drive
this car on the road you gotta get used
to a lot of people stairs the way people
drive here I'd be so afraid to have
anything nice on the road well
fortunately we are it seems chaotic but
there's certain moves in order in in the
places you just had to be here to know
that and once you get used to it yeah
yeah sure yeah
feeling very authentic in Italian right
now that better pass the restaurant
which is of course you know very you
know adventurous of us
hey slick thumbs up for adventurous how
many times if that happens today this is
why I had the camera rolling no I was
waiting I was waiting for you to walk
him to the door I was like one corner
anyway how's that quick that was that
was significantly more than Taipei 101
I was just gonna head out I didn't want
to be in here
something like that
yep oddly explain why you're bailing on
us early so that you can like go to
sauna craft thing yes but there's
additional reasoning that I can't say
what I can say after I'm back what you
know what I'm talking about you're just
letting everyone in the audience be no
actually I'm not
white she was talking about I'm like the
paparazzi well apparently you're like
every every lady hears yeah I did what
you're trying to get away with a tearful
goodbye I'm gonna tell all the ladies
that are here that your beard is really
sharp is it yeah well I've never liked
active dude that was like chin in my
neck before something all right
