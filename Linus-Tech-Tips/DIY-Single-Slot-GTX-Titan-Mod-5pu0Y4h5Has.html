expansion slots for adding new
functionality that most people don't
even know what to do with them all at
least in theory because thanks to modern
graphics cards ballooning thermal output
almost none of them are available with
single slot coolers meaning that if you
want to run a single graphics card you
take up two of your expansion slots you
want to run to boom
you just took up four of your expansion
slots now the solution to this used to
be very simple you take your graphics
card you rip that cooler off of it and
then you go ahead you put a water block
on it so that you can actually install
something in the slot right next to it
without compromising the cooling well
not if Nvidia or AMD you have anything
to say about that check this out
here's a couple of modern cards you see
the problem they have connectors in the
next slot over so we're going to show
you guys how to take care of that and
single slot fi a modern GPU
you
cuddle bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you browse the web as
if you're in one of 20 different
countries check out the link in the
video description to learn more so I'm
actually going to start with a pre
water-cooled card the purpose of this
video is not to be a comprehensive guide
on how to water cool your graphics card
because we've actually done that before
you can check out that video right
around here no this one is just intended
to address the difficulties associated
with water cooling a card that has IO
that's in the slot next to it you know
whether you're trying to just increase
the number of slots that you have access
to or whether say for example there's a
particular type of slot that's being
covered that you need well this should
help you and then again last thing to be
clear I'm not necessarily recommending
that you do this because while we will
be taking what I believe will be the
appropriate precautions to ensure that
our card still works at the end of this
your mileage may vary considerably and
this is not the kind of guide that you
will find anywhere on you know I don't
know AMD or nvidia z' website so the
first step is to find yourself the
appropriate cutting wheel so we're just
going to be using one of the standard
cutting disks and not our reinforced
cutting discs rather and not the nubbin
of a one that was on there before step
number two is to remove the rear i/o
plate from the card this will subject
the card itself to less metal shortage
all over the place then if I were to try
and cut this while it was attached there
we go
but before doing that we are going to
mask off any exposed PCB parts of the
card as well as we possibly can
to avoid any metal splinters or shards
causing shorts on the board by just
getting lodged into places on bridging
contacts so I have this handy dandy bag
that's exactly the size of a video card
that I'm going to try and use for that
with a lot of block on it a video card
is no longer exactly the size of the
video case once we can mask off the
board okay so the last thing to consider
before the point of no-return which we
are about to embark upon is whether or
not you need this connector so this is a
DVI D whereas this is a DVI I so that
actually leaves us with DVI VGA though
not at the same time although I think
they are split ok I'm not actually sure
don't quote me on that one DVI or VGA
HDMI and DisplayPort on this particular
card so as long as we don't need dual
DVI then we should be pretty much good
to go now in theory this should work
because a disconnected connection is
still a disconnected connection whether
it's here at the connector or whether
it's here at the well we sawed it off
there so I guess without any further
stalling driveling time let's get our
vacuum cleaner in position now it's
called a vacuum cleaner but you would
never use it to clean a vacuum I mean by
this logic a car wash
should use a car to wash something will
be up to the editor whether that gets
left in or not
Oh
that's a little that's yeah that's steel
that's a little tougher than I was
hoping I think we're gonna bring out the
big guns here
I cut my damn vacuum
so I didn't cut it much I only cut it a
little cool oh wow so there you have it
our DVID connector has been cleanly
sheared off I don't know exactly what
difference this will make but my sort of
common sense would dictate that you want
to take these these connector wires here
and separate them so now they were
contacting each other what's left now is
to do our PCI backplate now with many
cards in the past it was possible to buy
these single slot back plates that just
had the i/o cutouts on the one side and
nothing no ventilation slots on the
other side but nowadays because there's
i/o here no one really sells those
anymore so we're just going to have to
we're just going to have to make do just
kind of eyeball it yeah it's really not
as tight as I'd normally like something
like this to be held
okay in theory a single slot bracket
maybe a file though these are really
sharp how okay so now all that's left
then is to reassemble our GTX Titan oh
you can see it is a really good thing
that we masked off our video card day
you can see those metal shards that were
flying around also we're going to be
careful now then to keep this video card
oriented this way so that those don't
fall out towards the car so I'm going to
use a little technique that I call
alcohol that washes away our problems
alright so now we can put our freshly
modded back plate on there ah there we
go oh yes oh no I dropped all his screws
there you go look at that it almost
looks natural if you ignore this the
last thing left now is to make sure that
our heart still works boom go get some
water
okay moment of truth time to find out if
the sucker works postcode fifty five
what does that mean oh I don't have time
for this right now
these fans are not plugged in okay let's
try it again
postcode fifty-five what are you so it
seems like it may be Ram related so
you're gonna go ahead and pop one of
these sticks out come on video card yeah
whoo I mean there's no real reason this
should never I shouldn't be that excited
but there you go it works I mean oh I
guess what I haven't shown yet he's
installing a card next to it let's say
we wanted a PCI Express SSD I'll what
the heck
it's PCIe 2x okay I need a 1x card where
am I gonna get a 1x card okay so let's
say you needed a TV tuner but I don't
have to have a good reason for doing
these things sometimes it's just because
I can boom TV tuner installed let's get
it booted up into an operating system
now cool well I'm kind of stoked on this
no one else cares someone what's the
point of these fancy motherboards with
all these slots if you can only use half
of them right so I think that pretty
much wraps it up then guys thank you for
watching if you dislike this video then
hit that dislike button posted on our
slash tech support Gor do whatever it
else / cringe wherever it is that you
want to talk about what an idiot I am
but the reality of it of it is that it
worked so there's that if you guys liked
it hit that like button get subscribe to

again for watching end if you guys are
done doing all that stuff and you're
kind of wondering gee what should i
watch next maybe check out the video
where I must have done something
interesting recently well I'm sure
they'll overlay something interesting
