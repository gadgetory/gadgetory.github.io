brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX it's been an interesting year
for LG monitors we went from basically
not really covering anything from them
at all to this year they got like ultra
wide this and IPs that and curved
whatever it's been absolutely crazy and
they're not stopping now this one is
going to be extremely exciting for
gamers it's very similar to some of the
ultra rides we've seen before
so it's got a 34 inch diagonal size and
it's got a 2560 by 1080 resolution but
the killer app here is not going to be
the IPS panel it's not going to be you
know it's got to stand or whatever a
nice slim bezel very similar to the ones
we've seen in the past the killer app
here is AMD's freesync technology
support so this is a new standard that
AMD worked with vasa worked with scaler
manufacturers worked with panel
manufacturers to try to get integrated
and it is for gamers it's kind of like
Nvidia g-sync in that the video card
tells the monitor when to refresh
instead of the monitor refreshing at a
fixed 60 Hertz which is what this panels
going to do and then just doing that all
the time which causes screen tearing
with the alternate being vsync on which
causes stutters whenever your framerate
drops below your V synced framerate
below your refresh rate so right here is
what looks like it's going to be V ultra
wide for gamers and this is interesting
LG in the past didn't really take the
whole gaming monitor thing that
seriously but I've never seen them
actually quote the input lag on a
monitor right next to the monitor before
so I'm really excited to try this one
out because especially with an IPS model
that's not something you typically see
but it's not just about gaming LG's got
some other pretty interesting stuff here
this is a 19 by 10 aspect ratio 4k
monitor meant for creative professionals
now when I say 4k a lot of the time I'm
actually being a little bit sloppy with
my terminology because UHD 3840 by 2160
is not technically the same thing as 4k
which is actually 4096
by 2160 so this guy right here is a 31
inch monitor that has full coverage of
99.5 percent of the Adobe RGB color
space comes pre-calibrated and looks
absolutely stunning and beautiful it
could be a very interesting in-between
for very high-end consumers who don't
quite want a 21 by 9 ultra wide want an
absolutely gorgeous professional-grade
monitor but do want a little bit more
width than a 16 by 9 I know we have one
of these coming so you can expect a full
review sometime in the next couple of
months but in the meantime I'm just
happy to have had a chance to to get a
look at this bad boy
in terms of inputs we've got I believe
it's three USB 3.0 ports we've got
DisplayPort mini DisplayPort and dual
HDMI in and man that looks beautiful
IPS panel of course shifting over just a
little bit we've got the 34 you see 87m
think they're calling this a business
model but honestly a lot of time I must
just be an incredibly boring person
because the business model often appeals
to me more than the consumer model now I
on my desk right now I have a 34 UC 97
which is actually right next to it and
the more consumer grade one and the main
difference here is not actually the
panel technology it's not the super slim
bezel it's not the curve of the 34 inch
34 40 by 1440 screen but it is the
stands design this one height adjustable
stand now for a flat monitor it's
important to have a height adjustable
stand for ergonomics for a curved
monitor in my mind it is essential to
have the monitor at exactly the right
height because as soon as you start
looking at it from above or from below
you lose any benefit of the natural
appearance of a curved display because
it's going to start to look kind of
weird and distorted you want to be
looking at it straight on
so I from what I can tell they're not
giving me any price quotes but sort of
the speculation is that pricing should
be fairly similar to the UC 97 and this
is the one that I would personally be
all over if I was looking for a 34 inch
curved monitor speaking of being all
over things I
/ telling you guys about our sponsors
