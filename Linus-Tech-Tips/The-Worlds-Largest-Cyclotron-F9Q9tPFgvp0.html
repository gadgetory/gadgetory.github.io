called a dosimeter and it's a tool for
measuring radiation why do I need a
dosimeter well although there shouldn't
be any significant radiation where we're
about to go there could be because we're
here at triumph the particle
acceleration laboratory here in British
Columbia Canada that houses the world's
largest cyclotron and soon the world's
most powerful linear electron
accelerator of its kind and what do they
do here not just casual things you know
like advancing the fields of physics
medicine material science and much much
more so without further ado let's head
inside and talk about how they
accelerate particles to about 75% of the
speed of light and also why the heck you
would want to do that in the first place
story blocks video offers you studio
quality stock video clips for a fraction
of the cost
check it out today at the link in the
video description
when you think particle accelerator the
first thing that probably comes to your
mind is CERN they are famous for digging
this great big tunnel that allows them
to accelerate two beams of particles too
near the speed of light then smash those
two beams together and see what happens
well triumph is a little bit different
they are more about directing a single
beam of superfast particles at an object
like say a piece of uranium by doing
this they can achieve a couple of things
one they can create isotopes or forms
and elements and compounds that
generally don't exist naturally
fluorodeoxyglucose for example is used
for brain research in the nearby
university of british columbia or two to
actually produce elements that either
wouldn't naturally occur or that would
be very difficult to study inside the
neutron star merger you'd have to travel
to in order to find them before we get
into that though let's go all the way to
the beginning with this
rather unassuming bottle of compressed
hydrogen so the hydrogen gets sucked up
through
this tube right here all the way up to
this spot right here and then this
chamber this whole thing is kept under a
vacuum so that takes care of the pumping
then it comes down into this plasma
bucket which is right here where a 2,000
degrees Celsius tantalum filament
ignites the plasma strips the electrons
from the atoms and then the hydrogen and
ions so these are the hydrogen atoms
that pick up extra electrons are fired
out through here and like really fast
because our 12,000 volts here is not
compared to ground but rather to the
entire source room that we're inside
which is kept at 300,000 volts
compared to ground when the accelerators
running it's a good thing it's not on
now we're on the outside so directly
above me is where our hydrogen and ions
leave the source room so from this room
to the wall here are a bunch of linear
resistors so the potential then goes
smoothly from the room up to 300,000
volts at the wall and when the particles
leave here they'll be traveling at
roughly 140th the speed of light to put
that in context that's about a hundred
and sixty thousand times faster than the
top speed of my car now dealing with a
huge electric potential like this isn't
easy
while our power supply here isn't
actually working as hard as you'd think
it only uses about 1 million once
charged to maintain that potential if
given the chance it will gladly create a
literal bolt of lightning between in the
room here and the wall so to prevent
this they've had to do a couple of
things first of all this entire room is
a Faraday cage and no wires can go
between it and the wall or it'll be
spark city in here so all of the data
and the control signals are sent over
fiber optic cables which is pretty
standard but then what about power you
can't do fiber optic power well that is
where this comes in so rather than just
running a wire remember we can't do that
or balloons they ran this non-conductive
shaft with a 30 horsepower motor on the
other side of the wall that allows them
to convert mechanical energy here into
electrical energy just like a
bog-standard generator pretty clever
now we're above the particle accelerator
where are wicked fast anions are coming
shooting down this tube but we have a
problem since they don't just come out
in a nice orderly fashion like a laser
but rather tend to scatter like a
flashlight the main goal here is just
getting the particles down there which
requires some real you know particle or
wranglin and all along this line is
triumphs sort of h minus particle prod
of choice basically they're precision
manufactured electrostatic plates called
quadruples that act kind of like lenses
for the charged particles to keep them
in line and
same technique gets used right here
where the particle beam actually gets
turned before being sent one floor down
into the real need of the particle
accelerator the 520 mega electron volt
cyclotron the largest in the world so
before we go inside there's a few things
that we've got to do any contamination
on the surfaces inside the cyclotron
will need to be cleaned after we leave
so they've asked us to wear lab coats so
we don't shed any unnecessary dust and
also to wear booties and not like kneel
down on the floor or anything like that
just to create as little extra work as
possible for all the texts that keep
this place running smoothly this is a
very high technology contamination
control barrier here I like it okay now
we are getting into where the magic
happens the cyclotron that sorry getting
a nasty look here sorry not magic
science magic isn't real sciences anyway
at this point our h- particles are
entering the circular track at 140th the
speed of light where large RF resonators
provide the acceleration and massive
deionized water cooled coils of aluminum
hold the particle on orbit now there are
two coils both with 15 turns positioned
around the cyclotron and each one
carries 18,000 amps but that incredible
power doesn't mean that the researchers
here don't also have a fair degree of
control over the speed of our particles
so as they whip around the loop the h-
particles will go faster and faster
it actually takes about 16 a hundred
laps before they'll reach full speed
that's about 3/4 of the speed of light
but what they'll also do is a kind of
spiral outward taking a wider path
around the accelerator kind of like how
in your car if you're going faster it's
hard to take a tight
turn that means that when it's time to
apply the last step using a thin piece
of carbon foil to strip the electrons
off so that we're left with just bare
protons the energy of our protons can be
fine-tuned according to where the carbon
is positioned on the inside of the
cyclotron gives us slower lower energy
particles or write out that the edge of
the cyclotron gives us the full 520 mega
electron volt experience once the
electrons are stripped our coils will no
longer keep the stream going around the
track so we're left with a straight
stream of positively charged particles
that'll turn whatever pore sample is on
the other side into matter soup of
course you can't have those particles
smashing into anything unintentionally
like air so the entire cyclotron needs
to be held at a vacuum of point zero
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
one bar to accomplish this they use
sounds so cool turbo molecular pumps
that's been at 40,000 rpm basically like
smacking the air molecules out and not
allowing them back in now this does
create the small problem of making the
vacuum chamber which is above us want to
collapse in on itself however to combat
that we're actually currently below the
cyclotron do you see all these poles
here well you might actually think that
these are these are supporting the
cyclotron like struts or something but
they're actually pulling down really
hard to make sure the whole thing
doesn't just flatten itself so that was
pretty sweet but just like you guys will
occasionally get the itch to upgrade a
graphics card even if you don't really
need to but you just want the latest and
greatest well after 45 years of
operation he
eventually the thrill of shooting
protons at 3/4 the speed of light around
the cyclotron started to wear off a
little and the researchers at triumph
needed a new way to snack stuff together
at super high speeds and continue to
push the frontiers of understanding so
they built the world's most powerful
electron linear accelerator or ela knack
so when it reaches full power in 2025
the ELA knack here will be able to
propel a hundred kilowatts of electrons
at a blistering 99.99% the speed of life
Wow so to accomplish this they first
need yet another three hundred kilovolts
our supply in a Faraday cage of it what
is it with these guys in their three
hundred thousand volt power supplies in
Faraday cages like a nice nice round
number or something anyway that gives
the electrons a pretty nice kick in the
butt too roughly 77% the speed of light
but that's that's just too slow that's
like peasant stuff where they really
start cooking are in these radio
frequency wave chambers so the insides
of these are cooled down to just 2
Kelvin using liquid helium surrounded by
a liquid nitrogen cooled heat shield I
guess that's why they call it the super
thermos and in there the electrons are
accelerated by the radio frequency field
in here oscillating rapidly 1.3 billion
times per second with these oscillations
synchronized to the speed of the
electron going through it so what that
means effectively is that the electron
is always being pushed along to the next
segment kind of like a railgun now one
of these accelerators would get our
electrons up to 10 mega electron volts
but that wasn't enough for them so they
got three three in a row gives it a
total of 30 mega electron volts of
particle smashing power so all in all
this accelerator consumes 1 million
watts watts or about enough power for a
thousand homes all right so we've had a
lot of talks so far about particles
going out of seeing speeds but now it's
time to transfer all that momentum into
something useful now depending on the
experiments what happens next can vary a
lot but normally it consists of getting
the beam to a point where it smashes
into samples of materials called targets
where the particles have enough energy
to split the nucleus of the atoms this
can create all kinds of fun things
neutrons muons or rare isotopes via
nuclear fission or spallation and it
also creates a big old pile of matter
garbage so at risk of sounding like a
broken record here this is where things
get tricky because you might not have a
lot of time to grab the important bits
some of the rare isotopes that they want
to study might only last for a few
milliseconds before decaying so
nanomaterials are designed and brought
to temperatures white-hot around 2,000
degrees Celsius to release the isotopes
superfast then depending on what exactly
is smacked together some of the longer
lived isotopes might get collected
locally while other particles would need
to go through several switching stations
some of which are below us here or for
further acceleration to arrive at an
experimental detector the one behind me
here called the titan ion trap
accurately measures and isotopes mass
using its cyclotron frequency so
basically there's a combination of
magnetic and electrical fields that trap
the particle in a confined space and
then you can calculate how fast the
particle moves around a track and from
there calculate its mass alternately
your isotope might get switched off of
the main line over there and end up in
something like Griffin which is kind of
like a microscope that's
looking for nuclei so Griffin is
actually the world's most powerful tool
for the decay spectroscopy of rare
isotopes and it provides triumphs
scientists with an unparalleled view of
the interplay of forces that create
nuclear structure here on the other side
the isotope atoms are delivered into the
black ball that it was showing when we
were here for B roll so we could show it
to you but I can't point it now and then
they're deposited on a tape reel and as
they decay gamma rays are emitted and
then are measured by these detectors
that go completely around the sample
giving a full 360 degrees of detection
after the measurement is performed the
tape reel gets spun some of which have
decayed into daughter nuclei that create
unwanted gamma ray background noise come
out through the lead wall on the other
side which shields the detectors from
the daughters more isotopes can then be
deposited on the tape and it's good for
another go these isotopes are used to
help us understand fundamental physics
but there are also lots of other
applications isotopes created here at
triumph have been used for things like
tracking the movement of plankton
detecting brain disease or cancer
treating cancer characterizing candidate
materials for superconductors
understanding how metal ions make
proteins and enzymes in our body do what
they do and you know what honestly if I
liver to list at all in this video we'd
go on for another 10 or 20 minutes but
but this light is I'm sure you've been
screaming at the screen for the last 10
minutes or so when are you getting to
the cool computer's okay okay now so
behind these doors is a Tier one data
center that analyzes experiment data
from the Atlas particle detector at the
Large Hadron Collider it has a 100
gigabit fiber pipe capacity that
connects to the LHC over at CERN in
Switzerland and other sites around the
world so that they can share the
ridiculous amount of computing and
storage needed to analyze and
store the massive amounts of data that
Atlas produces so in there they've got
12,500 CPU cores 12 petabytes of disk
storage and 31 petabytes of tave storage
oh it that is does open but I'm haha I
thought it was gonna be locked
unfortunately we're not actually allowed
to go in there something-something
currently holding the record for tier
one computing uptime something something
me getting close to it I don't know I
don't really know I don't really know
what the issue was so this was really
cool and it's the end of our tour but
it's hardly the end for the work being
done here at triumph they're actually
expanding like crazy
along with ramping up the ELA knack
they're gonna be tripling their rare
isotope production capabilities in the
next couple of years adding another
building and continuing to employ around
a hundred co-op students every year to
teach them about particle acceleration
so maybe then we'll have to come back
when they've got another big update to
show us maybe we can get behind those
data center doors next time yeah but in
the meantime I just want to give a huge
shout out to Stu for coordinating our
