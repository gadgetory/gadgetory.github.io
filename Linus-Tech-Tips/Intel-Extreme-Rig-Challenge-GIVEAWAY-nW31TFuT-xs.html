and it was cool in 2015 they sent us the
Master System which frankly wasn't that
cool
it is now 2016 and if windows release
patterns are anything to go on then this
one
should be cool
okay so as usual I'm equipped with my
instructions the box itself and this
isn't usual my smoke machine for added
dramatic effect
I'm sure the stuffs good for you packing
peanuts the worst thing on earth
okay so first is a strap I get the
symbolism here Intel speaking what shall
we send us strapping young gentlemen
like Linus Sebastian okay there is an
LED flashlight there is a Gerber knife
nice I can complete the rest of my
unboxing with this it seems like
dangerous it's the kind of thing that
you know big liability concerned
companies like Intel usually avoid it's
like sending knives without 16 warnings
of
protect yourself if you like and that's
pretty much it the space capsule
to the rescue
okay so first up is the Intel classified
briefing clothes which the instructions
assure me are actually okay to read
Department of Strategic Services Intel
Corporation agent you have been
activated as is this burning sorry I'm
fine really
nation thought system builders have been
recruited to create the most extreme
gaming break imaginable so in a nutshell
Intel is launching a competition where
12 system builders will all compete to
build the best possible most amazing
gaming system so you the public can vote
for which of the twelve finished systems
will get given away so seven of them and
you can pay attention to that using
hashtag Intel rig challenge and you can
cast your vote by sharing your favorite
team on Twitter with that hashtag voting
can be done up to one time per day
through September 3rd and each vote wins
them a chance to win one of the final
seven rigs that will be raffled off at
PAX Prime but let's find out what else
is in here
how lighter
that's a Taser dude no it's a lighter
justice chaser it is not a Taser I mean
I'm not going to touch it and find out
that's probably a charger a Yeti intel
extreme challenge thermos ah now we've
gotten to the bulk of the action here so
there's an all-access pass to PAX Prime
which apparently includes airfare hotel
and conference not too shabby
there's Tom Clancy's Rainbow six siege
please tell me it's a PC copy yes it is
ah good I thought there might have been
possible Intel completely lost their
mind sending knives and dangerous
lighters and console copies of video
games to people also inside is a pair of
rocket cave or cough I think they call
them headphones an intel extreme rig
challenge t-shirt they assumed large
they were wrong and then finally in
place of what would normally be the
products that they've just announced
like the new core i7 69 50 x10 core
extreme edition processor with turbo
boost max technology 3.0 and unlocked
core multiplier and HP de Foix channel
ddr4 2409 we control it unlike how they
normally include that product in the box
I get this handsome piece of paper which
I plan to put on my wall in my office
other than that I think we've got some
manuals here yes manuals and
documentation and this very nice
backpack so that's pretty much the gist
of it guys follow along with the intel
extreme rig challenge using the hashtags
on Twitter that I mentioned before and
you can find links to the full details
