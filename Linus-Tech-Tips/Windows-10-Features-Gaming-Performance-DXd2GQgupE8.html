with it came new windows yeah a shiny
new office but still the same old
terrible jokes but you know what's not a
joke today's video topic performance
under Windows 10 does it hold up to
Windows 8.1 what about Windows 7 users
out there do they need to upgrade drop a
like on this video if you're glad that
our upload schedule is such a mess right
now that I can't even tease a future
video and ask you to like this video if
you're amped to see it
Intel's bringing ddr4 to the mainstream
with their all-new core i7 6700 K and
Core i5 6600 K processors check out the
link in the video description to learn
more now to start with the differences
between different windows is are
obviously more than just you know
performance in CPU intensive tasks I
mean Windows 8 and the free upgrade to
Windows 8.1 brought SMB 3.0 which in
theory allows aggregated speeds during
network transfers although I've never
gotten it to work Windows 10 has Cortana
the new edge browser actually there's
one let us know if you'd like to see us
use our sexy new 200 up 200 down fiber
connection to determine which browser is
indeed the fastest by mashing that like
button huh I knew I could come up with
something sorry where was I right
Windows 10 features it's got DirectX 12
although that won't make much of a
difference until some games for it come
out and of course it's got some UI
improvements now that last part probably
wasn't getting you too excited about
Windows 8 unless you were one of the
tiny minority who actually bought a
touchscreen laptop and even though I
have one the lack of a traditional Start
menu has really put an acorn in my
tailpipe over the last couple of years
and breathe new life into third-party
Start menu add-on companies but with
Windows 10 that might be a little
different the UI improvements are many
some are pretty small things like
automatically prompting me for a second
window when I arrow snap tiling all my
open applications when I alt have a huge
improvement over that rubbish rolodex
thing that was introduced with Windows
Vista oh look we have a 3d accelerated
desktop experience but some of them are
huge virtual desktops which are accessed
with Windows and tab are finally a
Windows feature by default this has been
available for years on Linux OS 10 and
even Windows with third-party tools and
the new Start menu which I actually
really really like it was as simple as
giving me an all apps list and not
taking up my whole Jing screen with the
Start menu good on you Microsoft there
are still a few things that are broken
as all get-out like search I mean
seriously if I type uninstall how is
uninstall a program not the first
search result and there are still a few
things I just need to learn like I
haven't figured out how to lock
notification tray icons so I can always
see certain things like safe remove
hardware and networking so yeah so far I
really like Windows 10 I did an in-place
upgrade on my daily driver laptop and a
fresh install on my desktop and haven't
thought for a moment about reverting to
Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 respectively
but what about that performance well I
had John our new benchmark err and
writer put together a small suite of
tests and run them for you folks on an
identical hardware configuration across
Windows 7 Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 all
of them freshly installed and with the
latest drivers and updates
he used a test bench that consists of an
Intel Core i7 59 30k and he su 699
deluxe motherboard 16 gigs of DDR 4 gtx
980ti
and a data SP 900 s SD and I guess
that's pretty much the relevant
components and the results may shock you
on our test bench and please note that
with quick boot enabled and fewer
devices in the boot menu and whatnot
these times could be much faster but the
importance here is the relative
performance not the absolute performance
Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 both left
Windows 7 in the dust for cold boot
times and go to sleep times but all
performed very similarly when it came to
wake time so there you go in PC mark 8 I
don't really know what to make of that
Windows 7 number there's no way on this
blue orb we're standing on that that
represents real-world performance but on
Windows 8.1 and 10 it basically tells us
that they're within spitting distance of
each other then finally we arrived at
gaming performance where across a test
suite that includes basically a couple
of modern games that acts both the CPU
and GPU we ended up with well no
difference whatsoever a testament to the
repeatability of our gaming tests if
nothing else but maybe there's more to
this than meets the eye
right now for legitimate owners of
Windows 7 and 8 Windows 10 is a free
upgrade so while in the past upgrading
for who knew
tech support that my graphics card might
not even handle even if games that
utilize that come out before the next
windows upgrade cycle was a bit of a
tough sell this time around there's that
I mean DirectX 12 looks ballin AF and
you can learn more about it in this tech
quickie video here but there's also just
no downside so Windows 10 gets a big
recommendation from us from a
performance point of view nothing to
lose with our config although please
note we only tested a limited
cross-section of games and only one
graphics card so I still think it would
be prudent to see if others with similar
configs to your owner having any issues
but yeah it's looking pretty good so far
