you guys and this one is actually kind
of interesting to me because it is an
ipad case that serves the purpose of
holding your iPad when it's in the car
so obviously it's not intended for the
driver it doesn't come with any
instructions which maybe maybe I got
like an oem version or something and
there's there's one that that does come
with instructions or something but I
guess we'll just have to kind of go on a
voyage of discovery here and figure out
how this works so I'm going to try
putting it in a snuggle truth in case
which i happen to have lying around and
see what the intended usage model here
is so okay the idea is that this is for
passengers so this is for if your kids
are in the back and you want them to you
know sit down and shut up you're trying
to drive so you put this on the seat the
front seat and then it hangs off the
back and then they watch videos on me on
the icon so there's a few different
straps on here so there's these these
ones which are in kind of a cross
pattern here there's this guy which is
an elastic one of these are there's a
couple paper clips and they're holding
this together okay so here this gives me
oh ok ok this gives me a clearer idea of
how it works well call these paper clips
sheesh ok and then there's these guys
right here so it looks like this sort of
goes around the seat and then this goes
you have your headrest tags that go
through these two you know we're going
to have to install this in order to have
any idea how it works ok and you know
what I don't think this is intended for
use with an additional case so I'm going
to go ahead and see what happens when I
get the ipad in here so I guess the idea
is you take your iPad and throw it in
here and then you go like this and in
theory you watch a video so let me fire
up your video you see
quantum of solace sure okay and play
okay why don't we go install this in a
car and see what we think of it at that
point okay guys so I'm trying to figure
this out i'm in my super civic right now
so i took out these two straps here then
I think you just take the whole thing
and haha that's how it actually works so
this cross strap goes on the headrest
these guys go here and then these two
straps let me lift that up come around
the bottom and I oh I didn't have to
take those out all the way but what you
do is you just run those through on the
other side i'm just going to do one of
them because this is just for
demonstrative purposes and since you
guys probably can't really see what i'm
doing anyway huh yes you can okay so
then you bring that backer on the front
and there's velcro right there so uh you
know what here hand me the camera and
I'm just gonna show you guys what it
looks like once it's installed so
there's the head brass final tip video
qualities uh probably not that good in
here because it's really really dark but
they're so I go ahead and I'm sitting in
the back seat so this gives you a pretty
good idea of what I see play my video
I'd say it's not perfect due to the fact
that this strap covers up like my
progress bar as well as some of the
movie but I mean it's very usable sorry
my Wi-Fi is not very good down here so
I'm not having too much luck with my
video streaming but if I wanted to go
ahead and play something like fruit
ninja then I should I should be able to
do that pretty easily and i can sit very
comfortably and operate the the ipad
like this here we go there we are yeah
looks like that kind of works nitze keen
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the snug headrest case for
the ipad 2 my suspicion is this might
actually work for other tablets as well
because it's the fitting is pretty
generic so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
