about the the sony DSC tx5 camera is
that it takes both memory stick pro duo
memory stick as well as SD they both
just fit in the same slot so that's
pretty cool especially for a sony camera
so I've gone ahead and installed my
memory card in 720p mode so I'm just
going to kind of show you around the
NCIX parking lot here so you can gauge
the video quality for yourself let's see
what happens if we look at the Sun ah
yeah that works pretty good I think it's
hard to tell because I'm looking at it
here stuff now you can see my shadow you
can see the box it came in and you can
also see the water I think the camera
can hear me when it's underwater well I
don't know i was actually yelling while
the camera was underwater so if you were
able to hear me then i guess it can
still hear even when I'm underwater
there's a cord lunch box that was
dropped here for some reason I'm not
really not really sure why but yeah do
you ever get that sensation when you're
dreaming like your phone okay that was
it I've had my fun I've had my fun the
camera is waterproof and hopefully the
video quality is pretty good so oh yeah
hey if you take it out of the water just
you can just kind of wipe the lens off
just like that it works great that's
pretty cool little camera actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
