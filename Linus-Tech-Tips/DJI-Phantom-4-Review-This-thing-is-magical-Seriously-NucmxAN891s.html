the best flying vehicle I have ever had
the pleasure of using and I'll spend the
next seven or so minutes telling you why
intel skull canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 quad-core processor
and Thunderbolt 3 learn more at the link
in the video description right out of
the box the Phantom 4 impressed me it's
small its light thanks to the magnesium
chassis and the packaging can actually
be reused as a really robust carrying
case it'll hold the quad a metric wack
ton of spare propellers the controller
and either 2 batteries or a battery and
a charger that's pretty much all that a
recreational user will need although
there's still room for accessories like
hard cases and backpacks for the pros
the setup process is fairly easy thanks
to the documentation but still a little
tedious so after charging the batteries
it took about 20 minutes of you know how
do I turn this on it's a quick press
followed by a long press by the way
screwing on the pill bottle style
locking propellers running around
looking for a lightning cable I used an
iPhone 6s for this review by the way
updating the firmware and figuring out
where to put a micro SD card only to
realize that a 16 gig one is included
out of the box bonus I did my first
latency test of the first-person view
camera feed and it is hard to say how
much of this is generational
improvements I mean my solo is just
about a year old now and how much of it
is DJ eyes use of a hardline USB
connection instead of that whole clergy
connect to a Wi-Fi access point here
that connects wirelessly to the drone
relay but wow this is head and shoulders
better than anything I've used before I
mean it's not like twitch reflex high
speed flying capable gear like those
blokes in the drone racing league you're
using but it is certainly responsive
enough to not be an excuse for a
photographer or a videographer to miss a
shot at least when it's sitting in the
entryway of my house literally one meter
away from the controller more on that
later now some folks can go on and on
about how sexy the Phantom 4 is but
drones don't really turn my crank and I
feel like if you see one quadcopter you
kind of seen them all it's got like you
guessed it four
yay so it's the underlying tech that
gets me excited here and let's get it up
in the air while we discuss the motors
have been upgraded for about a 20
percent improvement in top speed that's
up to 72 km/h in sport mode with the
5300 milliamp hour lipo battery rated at
a maximum of 28 minutes though this
assumes a very steady flight and optimal
conditions not being a drone ace I
personally didn't find much reason to
whip around that fast but there is more
to the improved motors than just I want
to go faster and in the normal P mode
the most impressive thing to me about
the Phantom 4 is its stability in the
air P or position mode uses a
combination of GPS downward facing
cameras ultrasonic emitters their new
inertial measurement unit and these
upgraded motors to achieve something I
just hadn't seen yet nearly perfect
hovering and shockingly fast
self-correction during small gusts of
wind or when the user suddenly lets go
of the sticks in the middle of a new ver
and it needs to compensate to get back
to a hover it's so confidence inspiring
to see it behave so predictably in the
air that I was actually willing to let
my four-year-old son help me fly it in
my lap something I wouldn't have even
considered with any other drone that I
have touched some of which theoretically
hover when you let go
but in practice require a fair bit more
user intervention than that which
doesn't mean it flies itself if you
don't want it to purists can switch to
the less helpful attitude mode which
turns off the GPS system and lets you
bank and drift through corners much more
naturally I mean I think the bottom line
about the Phantom 4 is that flying it is
just such a pleasure
however manual or not manual you want it
it behaves smoothly and predictably and
the first-person view is fantastic just
fantastic I mean to be clear I am aware
that there are DIY solutions that can
handle
lower latency and longer range but to
say I was blown away when I flew for 20
minutes
around the corner of a building and up
to a kilometer away which is as far as I
can go maintaining line-of-sight with my
binoculars anyway without so much as a
compression artifact on the video feed
would be an understatement
again the 3dr solo also a very good
drone went a similar distance but not in
a confidence-inspiring manner I mean it
would glitch out here and there and the
video feed was anything but HD by that
distance which leads us pretty well then
into the camera it is great I was quite
critical of DJI initially for moving to
their own proprietary camera system
instead of collaborating with a market
leader like GoPro except whether they
saw this coming or it was just a lucky
guess GoPro has sat on their ass and
done absolutely nothing noteworthy in
the last year and a half while DJI has
been innovating so the camera is
slightly sharper than the phantom 3
professional and while I lack one
personally for comparison it is really
really similar to the inspire one based
on this fantastic video from fall
Canarsie hobby and the gimbal actually
has an added support link as well for
better stability the 120 FPS 1080
recording mode was quite disappointing
and I'll let you be the judge of its
low-light performance so this is 1080 60
P footage as we were approaching dusk on
an otherwise sunny and beautiful day but
my overall takeaway here is that the
footage is professional-grade stable and
looks amazing what a payoff for DJI on
that gamble which leads us pretty well
then into the phantom force touted
autonomous flying modes I have no use
personally for click to fly where you
touch the touchscreen and it goes where
you touched I can operate control sticks
but the object tracking mode that I'm
using on my bike here is freaking sick
you drag a box around the object you
want to track and the Phantom 4 follows
it using its front mounted cameras to
either avoid
coming obstacles or go around them and
under carefully controlled conditions
it's amazing it actually uses the visual
tracking rather than a link to the
remote control unit the way most of
these solutions work yet it actually
managed to produce more usable footage
of a moving subject running around below
it than my three are solo with that said
though it has a long way to go before I
will trust it in the way that I do the
Phantom 4 is other features a quick
moving subject can easily shake off the
drone and from my experience taking my
bike for a very sweaty stressful ride
around the neighborhood even under what
I would consider to be pretty ideal
conditions with a high vis yellow object
to track the altitude and the following
distance of the drone was all over the
place it lost me twice while maneuvering
slowly and the collision avoidance
system managed to scrape a street lamp
but fortunately without crashing stop
dead in front of a branch that it wasn't
going to hit instead of going around it
and not stopped itself as I crept
towards fairly dense foliage pulling
into my driveway it works sometimes but
it's not a mode that I would actually
use unless I had the kind of income that
would make buying a new phantom for
basically inconsequential which leads us
then to the conclusion here because the
Phantom 4 is not cheap is it worth the
money well not if you don't have a
thousand dollars lying around I suppose
but if you were shopping for a fancy
quadcopter for pleasure or even light
professional use then the lack of an
HDMI output on the controller without
$100 add-on module and some tinkering is
a bummer but I can't criticize much else
about it it's not as much of a blast to
rip around in the park as a fully manual
even a fixed-wing quite frankly and it
feels more like a tool to use than a toy
to go out and play with but that doesn't
mean that it's boring and combined with
some creativity the Phantom 4 really
that's a lot of fun into its
functionality bottom line this thing
spanks I'm going to try and popularize
that that's banks bro so here's some
good news mass drop you might know them
from such deals as deals on knives deals
on camping supplies deals on keyboards
or deals on audio gear the way the mass
drop works is they find authorized
resellers or manufacturers and they say
hey we've got this huge community of
enthusiasts if you drop your price we
can get a bunch of people to buy and
then they go to the enthusiast they say
hey if a bunch you guys commit to buy we
can get them to drop their price and
they've recently branched out into
exclusive products as well so they're
actually working with HiFi man to bring
back their 8300 headphones with a
special nd or mass drop edition twist so
at the beginning solely under the hi-fi
man brand these entry-level
can you really call them that headphones
were priced at 300 US dollars so the new
ones are very similar to the older 8300
s but with an updated and more
lightweight structure a more neutral
sound signature and an all-black
appearance compared to the silver and
black of the older generation product
but the most important change is they
have reduced the price to an actually
legitimately low 99 US dollars so check
out those headphones and moreover at
drop tops
