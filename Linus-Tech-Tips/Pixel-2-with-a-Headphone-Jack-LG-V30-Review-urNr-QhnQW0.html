review of the LG g5 that was my bad
but knowing all that stuff at the time
still wouldn't have changed anything
about my conclusion to this day I don't
believe that the bulky design and the
trade-offs in camera quality and water
resistance were offset by the promise of
modular upgrades and other than a
surprisingly vocal minority apparently
neither did most people but while the g6
fixed a handful of my gripes including
adding water resistance it wasn't until
the recent launch of the V 30 that I saw
this kind of demand for an LG phone
review again so immediately after
finishing my pixel to video I dropped it
for the V 30 let's see how that went
after I feel your ears with Corsairs
message about the new HS 50
multi-platform three-and-a-half
millimeter headset it features 50
millimeter neodymium magnets and more
check it out now at the link below
right out of the box the V 30 is
something that the G Series never was
it's a head-turner I've gotten more
comments on this than I did during the
couple of weeks that I spent using the
me mix 2 and the mix 2 is a stunning
looking device LG has taken the same
kind of leap forward here that Samsung
did when they went from the plastic s5
to the curvy glass and aluminum s6 edge
IMO and under the hood you'll find all
the things that the discerning consumer
would expect from a flagship phone these
days yes actually all of them with the
highlights compared to the eerily
similar pixel to Excel being microSD
expansion wireless charging and yes a
headphone jack and not just any
headphone jack Google placed its bets on
users preferring to listen aloud
equipping the pixel to excel with one of
the best sets of front-facing stereo
speakers that I've ever heard on a
smartphone while LG skimped on a single
palm firing speaker and then went all in
on the headphone experience and as
someone who uses both about equally I am
really torn on this finely damn because
the V 30s headphone jack is more than
just present it stands out presumably
the reason it's disabled by default is
to save some battery life but if you
listen to music throughout the day as
much as I do
LG's quad amp high fived DAC setting is
a must
I'm not going to say that it is
competitive with an external amp and DAC
that cost as much as the whole phone and
it should really have a simple touch and
drag custom EQ configuration option but
even with those complaints in mind this
is the first time to sit since probably
ever that I felt even remotely tempted
to use digital filters on a phone the
short preset ended up being a great
match for the trashy pop music that I
listened to and it makes this device a
fantastic middle ground between the
ho-hum audio solutions that dominate the
smartphone market
and then investing a bunch of extra
money not to mention pocket space into
something external sold them right hold
on let's talk about the screen I didn't
mention the blue shift on the pixel to
excel while I was working on my review
and the reason is that frankly in my
opinion that whole thing got blown way
out of proportion it is more pronounced
on the LG made P OLED panel which
appears to be a close relative of the
one in the V 30 than it is on the
Samsung AMOLED panel in the smaller
pixel too but it doesn't affect any of
the angles that I hold my phone at and
OLED displays of all flavors have
exhibited this kind of behavior to
varying degrees for so long now but I
don't even consider it noteworthy
anymore so I liked the display on the
pixel to excel and I liked it on the V
32a far bigger concern is the potential
for burnin now my pixel to excel and be
30 are both still perfect which is again
why I didn't mention it but I do have
some bad news for you guys now
theoretically any OLED can get burnin
eventually some just faster than others
and if any of the unit's out there are
suffering from baked-on on-screen
buttons after just a couple of weeks
this does set off some alarms for me the
good news though is that by regularly
mixing up your on-screen elements I
should have changed this watch face more
often on that subject by running lower
brightness overall and by avoiding
notorious apps like ways you can prolong
your displays life and to give consumers
additional confidence LG is offering an
extra year of warranty just for
registering the device as long as you're
American the rest of the world gets a
good old fashioned sorry about that and
while as a Canadian I can certainly
appreciate that gesture I'd rather have
another year of warranty and on the
subject of things I'd rather have there
are a few other v30 drawbacks that do
need to be addressed here the battery is
a little small for such a large phone
it didn't really affect me day-to-day in
my wanderings about town but the Excel
twos is bigger the camera is also
immediately and obviously inferior to
other similarly priced flagship
smartphones like the iPhone 8 plus
galaxy s 8 and pixel to excel and LG's
Android skin while functional didn't
light my world on fire even though I
have an unlocked phone it shipped
chock-full of bloatware and while their
animation style actually contributes to
the phone feeling really snappy it lacks
some thing not just something anything
to set it apart where's the swipe down
for notifications on the rear touch
sensor
where's this squeeze for a Google
assistant where's the system-wide camera
quick launch it only does volume down if
the phone isn't locked and dare I say it
where's the big speed button as skinned
Android experiences go LG's is fine and
never offended me in any way it even
allows the software nav buttons to be
remapped Google and the V 30s hardware
is both stylish and powerful but I feel
like all but the hardcore wired
headphones are going to gravitate
towards other options like the Galaxy S
8 or pixel to XL which isn't to say that
that matters to our sponsor for today's
video d brand because they support all
three of these devices D brand is your
source for awesome vinyl skins and
they've got them for laptops phones
tablets consoles controllers and more
they use only high quality authentic
true textured 3m vinyl and probably the
best thing about shopping with the brand
is their configurator when you go over
to their site you just select which
device you have and you go ahead and
just pick from all the different colors
and textures of skins and you get a
real-time preview of exactly what your
device is gonna look like and it's not
just about looks deep brand skins can
also protect your belongings from
incidental scuffs and scratches their

work with and their products are
affordable and ship worldwide check them
