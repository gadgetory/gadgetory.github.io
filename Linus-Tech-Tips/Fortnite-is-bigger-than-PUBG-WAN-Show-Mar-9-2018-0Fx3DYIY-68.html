are we kidding
we're live gentlemen um and ladies I
don't know your mom might be watching
oh we've got a great show for you guys
today yeah actually we've got a great
show for you guys today Jake did the
land show document so other than that
it's a great show we're gonna go super
tangent off the dock yeah make it worse
not even gonna use the dock because I'm
all about demoralizing the people who
work here yeah that's what it's all
about and you know as much fun as it is
to demoralize James and had kind of lost
its its shine yeah but they got a new
person yes we want someone new to work
on the wind show dock yeah so that we
can crush their soul yeah so today it's
Jake um actually oh oh oh this is cool
so topics today we're gonna probably
kick it off with impressions of the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 see that's actually
an s8 but you'd never know the
difference
yeah I was like um and like the very
minor camera differences on the back
flip II the burger-flipping robot
started working at Cal a burger in
California we'll go through what a
burger flipping robot means and how
effective it was but the source for that
article was master disaster so I'm
assuming that Jake wrote it himself also
there's new egg customers in Connecticut
receiving tax bills because new egg
didn't charge themselves back sorry Jake
and modders were able to put coffee like
CPUs into skylake and kb lake
motherboards to a certain degree of
success which is actually kind of crazy
so why don't we roll the intro and we'll
get on with the show where theoretically
we'll talk about all those things that
we just talked about that we're gonna
talk about but actually we're probably
gonna end up talking about something
else we sometimes do it
we got that squished we got that fresh
food we got that jerky hooray all right
so we're gonna kick things off with the
most important news this week - cat tips
the YouTube channel that has videos of
my cat including this fantastic one
right here that I uploaded yesterday
it's got my cat I was trying to well you
can probably figure out based on the
tile tile back wall there what I was
trying to do so I was trying to do that
random you know the cat decided that he
had already done that needed somewhere
to wipe his butt I'm deciding on my hair
so this is the hundred thousand hundred
thousand subscriber update for - cat tip
it's got 120,000 views best-performing
video on this channel all the time and
the big news here though is that lioness
cat tips the most important channel at
lioness Media Group has crossed a
hundred thousand subscribers I'm
surprised you have a B - meaning meaning
the world's probably just because of the
last couple of days right okay
where it went from eighty five thousand
subscribe okay we should go we should
probably go all the way back to here so
this is when the NCIX bankruptcy auction
vlog hit floatplane okay yeah so we got
you know 1500 or so subscribers like
normally it actually does grow like
let's look at the full monthly
statistics here social things a great
site for creeping on YouTube channels by
the way you guys it's awesome you can
like see how many subs they get how many
views they get this is BS don't trust it
believe me like I mean any number that's
like well somewhere between 77 cents and
$12 imagine you were able to pay for
things like that yeah imagine you walked
into McDonald's it's like yeah super
value menu it cost anywhere between you
know 69 cents and 18 bucks yeah like oh
I don't know until you're checking out
that's right you know what
hold on a second gave them a bad idea
this is I should not have said
microtransaction restaurant loop bought
Lube box the restaurant oh absolutely
brilliant so you don't know so you take
away all the like oh I don't know what
to pick off the menu cuz you don't
well no cuz its weight yeah so you get
what would you pick like one of three
different tiers of loot box and so you
might end up yeah so you get the five
dollar loot box it's like they're single
serving double serving or like
three-course meal loot box Wow
and so I'd probably go so some people
are gonna cuz like gaming themed
establishments are totally a thing yeah
for the most part bars I guess yeah
there's a lot of gaming bars okay but
the gaming the loop box restaurant where
you go in and like sometimes you're
gonna get like a sort of like adequate
meal and then other times you're gonna
get like the fricken in a diamond armor
whatever crap is popular Sarmad sure
yeah yeah we're gonna get horse armor
anymore but yeah and then sometimes
it'll you'll spend like considerable
manoa melee it'll literally just be like
a day old McDonald's you gotta add some
junk no you'd either get okay you could
get like an adequate meal or you could
get like like something really nice and
it like comes with actual like gamer
loot like it could come with like an
amiibo oh right or like t-shirts because
remember the thing about loot boxes is
that you're you already know you're kind
of paying too much so no the base meal
is already decent and you might get loot
and so effectively the people who just
get a meal are subsidizing the people
who get like something else a little bit
more overall but there's a chance you're
gonna get some cool gear just like a
Lube box yeah I like that that's
probably way more reasonable than tailed
McDonald's um there's a there's a
there's a restaurant downtown Vancouver
if there's two of them same name one of
them is more just a like very small hole
in the wall place than the other ones
a big establishment but they're both
called Stormcrow I think one of them is
tavern and one of them is something else
anyways can we're getting kind of
crapped on it's called a kid's meal
balloon is a toy
whatever man no no no this is for adults
probably different ideals yeah and you
might get you don't get t-shirts and
kids meals he's just talking about yeah
me bows and teachers this is like nicely
branded stuff not like some super sight
totally different yeah but yeah
Stormcrow I believe you can roll a d20
okay depending on what the d20 results
in you get a different I think it's a
shot okay I'm not sure and then if you
get a 20
I don't remember something cool happens
people are complaining the cameras
tilted and like to my eye it is okay is
it just tilting over time cuz didn't we
check it before the street I don't know
and like part of its like is this shelf
on an angle yeah yeah so people probably
are just attributing that I think we're
just gonna
that's noticeably better we're gonna
roll it okay you know there's a little
too much Headroom Jake can you adjust
the Headroom down a little bit maximum
have you got this you got this
alright what the heck were we talking
about it seemed important the boxes oh
no it was really important Linus cat
tips okay right so what happened right
yeah yeah what happened here was next
hit YouTube and this nothing channel
went from 85 thousand to one hundred and
sixty thousand subscribers in three days
so you doubled this is actually more
like two days because it was like the
evening of the seventh and it is now not
yet even the evening of the ninth and
the reason did you watch the and CMC
vlogs yeah yeah so you saw the part
where ultimately okay I've got some
people saying that it was the wrong move
to give the guy well not give it to him
I mean he bid for it like he won it in
the auction but to sort of let it go do
you think it was the wrong move I think
what you baby should have done cuz you
knew this what maybe not to the scale
maybe you thought more scale I don't
know but you knew you would pass 100k
yeah but I also knew that Lynas cat tips
was gonna end up with a hundred thousand
subscribers eventually anyway yes I
could have done it at any moment over
the last three years yeah just like that
accelerating it yeah you could have got
it from with the idea that like hey I'll
get you the cat tips walk well that's
interesting or you could have used your
contacts instead of using his contacts
to try to be like hey let's get him the
freakin button you know I didn't think
of that at all I should have totally
done that I should have totally been
like look I want the NCIX tech tips one
but tell you is you don't ultimately
we're know I should have just created
like a troll like extra one yes yes like
yes yeah you should have named it almost
identical to his channel with like a
period or something yeah so that you I
can't really tell yeah it's been like
alright guys let's get this dude cuz you
got you got it eighty something yeah you
could mean I didn't think about it ah
why do I even ask you these things so
now you need to make n CX dot or like
use a weird character for the eye or
something and do it again and then when
he hit it again I gotta tell you the
okay so first of all all the people
saying that like he didn't deserve it
cuz he's a top ten channel or something
or he probably bought his subscribers
what are you talking about like the guy
uploaded a lot of videos I never even I
didn't yeah I know people are like
they're like mad that like a crappy
top-10 channel got the play button and
I'm kind of sitting here going you guys
I mean I don't think we left the entire
cut of all of my interaction with him in
the video but what happened was he won
it fair and square
yeah and I asked for it and he was like
no and then I explained that I was the
one who started that channel and he was
like oh no problem then take it he
seemed cool he was totally cool about in
a little bit that I saw you seem cool
and so I had a couple minutes between
being on the auction floor and then
going to the front where we were gonna
pick it up to kind of think about I went
like he was really cool about this what
happened with him was he was with a
crappy MCN back when he crossed his one
hundred thousand threshold so he's got
his gold button already but he was with
a crappy MCN that for whatever reason he
got lost in the shuffle and he wasn't
able to claim his silver play button
yeah so he just wanted one so that he
could rebrand it not because he didn't
earn it
but because he never got his that he did
earn and I was like you know what at the
end of the day I've got in my fantastic
studio with my amazing staff three
silver play buttons on the wall this
gold and not to mention the two gold
play buttons and he was so cool about it
like if he wasn't really cool about it
and he was like niobium and I you know I
I think I should have it Lee but he
wasn't like that at all if he wasn't
cool about it I would have I would have
wanted to fight harder for it but he was
just such a nice guy that I thought it
was I thought it was the right thing to
do I understood your stance at the time
but yeah I would have tried to pull
something like making a game to make
like a really similar channel name or
that would have been a better move that
would have been the pro move but I still
have no regrets I still feel good about
how it went down and if nothing else uh
we should now make like try to make a
channel that's like NCIX but like change
something very minor it's hard was it
insects or insects called cix calm and a
big NCIX a small calm yeah yeah cuz I
remember I actually funny I remember
having an argument internally about what
we were gonna call it because NCIX
wasn't available for some reason and I
got questioned like quite a few times
about why it wasn't NCI XCOM oh and I
was like because you can't have a period
in the URL and they were like are you
sure I'm like yeah yeah you can
people are like you should create a
floatplane NCIX plaque so honestly the
one that I really want is the gold one
but I'm gonna tell you something the
gold one is missing did someone take it
from the office kind of looks that way
wasn't me like you're giving me that
look no I actually had nothing to do
with it so I'm just I'm just rapidly
speculating privately who it might have
been so the rumor that I heard was that
it was in the CEOs office the last it
was seen and now it's not so I would and
no Riley doesn't have it
I asked Riley he's a straight-up dude he
would have told me yeah so he was the
last one left working on the NCIX tech
tips Channel and he says he doesn't have
it and the last time he saw it it was in
the CEOs office so oh you know what in
other crazy important news that Jake did
not put in the document Wow um you did a
great job there's been a lot of
speculation that we will be acquiring
the NCIX tech tips channel and I can put
that to rest once and for all we are not
acquiring the NCIX tech tips channel all
right be in peace yep not for a lack of
effort but disappointed it it will not
be possible
and so yeah honestly I'm pretty
disappointed I had a I actually had a
pretty rotten day that day I had a bunch
of things go wrong and I had the call
that sort of was the nail in the coffin
that I will not be getting it
it is my belief that whoever is taking
control of it is going to basically burn
it to the ground and piss on the ashes
according to the plan that they have
described to me which is really
disappointing because I put a lot of
work into that I mean that's where I
that's where I cut my teeth as a
youtuber that's for you
cut your tea to youtube it's kind of sad
that we're not getting it I was pretty
excited when we were talking about it so
I I had felt very strongly that we
should be allowed to buy it but it's a
little more complicated than that
legally and it's just not going to be
possible so I mean yeah you know I might
as well be upfront with you guys the
only way we were gonna get it was if we
bought NCIX
which might seem like a great idea on
paper so it would include the domain the
sophisticated inventory management and
back-end software yes yes definitely
sophisticated the very not cobbled
together back-end management system yes
the trademarks the copyrights the
intellectual property including their
fantastic mobile app mm-hmm
basically the the untarnished brand oh
absolutely
the nobody's wondering where their
shipments are the fantastic
relationships that that that brand will
inspire with potential suppliers owing
people money and then never giving it to
them is a really great way to establish
trust now I mean to be clear no you
wouldn't acquire the debt so this is
this is interesting so the way that it
works with the bankruptcy proceedings is
that these assets are being liquidated
by the bankruptcy trustee so the funds
are not actually going to the original
owner the funds are going to the
creditors meaning that even if let's say
NCIX owed you oh I don't know six
million dollars hypothetical number
um no not me someone else but it's not
hypothetical it's real ah let's say NCIX
would you six million dollars and let's
say at the auction that we attended and
through the sale of the the domain and
the intellectual property and all that
that they managed to raise I don't know
let's use a realistic number two million
dollars you're six million which is only
one-fifth of the total debt this is all
this is all leaked out there of your six
million you would get one fifteenth of
that whatever that works out to like
300k oh I thought they had to go banks
first so right assuming it all went out
equally yeah so so some people are gonna
have more robust contracts yeah that
will entitle them to being paid first a
lot of the time as far as I know and I
could be totally wrong here but I think
that usually results in two so the new
owners fair and square
owned the the domain the the the server
infrastructure whatever it is that
they've paid the trustee for and there's
no debt associated with it but life is
rarely that simple and if I was oh I
don't know let's say Corsair who is
owned a million dollars did I say owned
erode of course there who's owed a
million bucks do I engage with this
brand again would you even if it was
under new management
I'd be salty and like the thing is if I
was a hardware company I would look at
this going like okay last time you guys
didn't make it you're going into the
exact same market with the exact same
inventory stuff with the exact same
buildings be exact website with less
storefronts with probably dramatically
harmed SEO dramatically harmed SEO
because everything's gonna be about you
being bankrupt site traffic a huge
amount of customers they never receive
shipments of possibly our products and
then got upset with us potentially
because of that like I wouldn't really
want to tell like I'd be I'd be like
this corpse is in the ground especially
why am I
trying to perform CPR like it and
especially if you're a GPU company yeah
if your company shipping GPUs you can
sell them immediately
to anyone why would you and here's the
thing NCIX has been effectively out of
business for so long that you know it
doesn't take a long time for a gap to be
filled canada computers came in and
opened up stores in NCIX as old
locations yeah memory express I don't
know if you know this but I don't know
if anyone knows this hold on one second
but but but I've ever okay good so yeah
this is this is a thing that is
definitely very public that's memory
expresses website it's everyone like
literally everywhere but Memex is going
to be opening up a new store I know that
I their to their Langley let me then
like three or four times since ncx
closed and Langley and how how hurt are
you that you have to go somewhere
slightly different it's ever so slightly
more difficult to get to but it's also
sort of on the way to work so the
parking is a little annoying so yeah so
that's the thing is they've been out of
the game for three months what incentive
is there for anyone to go back because
you don't
okay ma'am X's website looks like 1998
day do you ever go to another computer
yeah yeah yeah I mean at least okay I'm
gonna have to double-check this but at
least to my knowledge memory Express
doesn't hide the per location inventory
the way that NCIX started doing over the
last few years like was that or was that
not an incredible so annoying
frustrating experience where it wouldn't
actually show you what was in stock yeah
no it's right here like it's just like
okay here's how many in this region are
in each store online stores different
individuals and actually this
I don't know how 1998 this is no this is
not 1998
like it's like 2008 okay hold on a
second
wayback machine and CIA axe oh okay hold
on hold on hold on let's just let's just
let's just uh what let's let's have a
look let's let's actually go okay we
can't go to 1998 let's go to 1999 okay
let's go to 1999 my friends here we go
may the 8 1999 one snapshot hold on oh
no this this would like it wow it
archived a broken page that's that's
interesting that's okay mm looks more
promising here we go okay that looks
that looks more promising what what you
doing what you doing Wayback Machine
wayback machine is the only way to
access NCIX now can you believe that
isn't that crazy
well if it if it does well like if it
does you know okay three snapshots come
on man you know you can tell this show
doesn't have a producer because stuff
like this wouldn't have there we go okay
so that we would know that's mrs. modern
this yeah this is 20 years early
brand-new try this is 20 18 February
okay well whatever okay well still I
mean we can still look at what NCIX has
looked like at the open there somewhere
out there right here yeah let's just go
like here
man way back is slow okay so this is
2004 this would have been like wow this
would have been like for prime time of
me shopping there as an actual customer
remember Celeste oka remember Sol Tech I
definitely member Sol Tech remember AMD
oh wait they made it oh they made it
their back baby
barely what else we got Oh cz remember
ocz memory I think I owned one of these
dang bus you know maybe 500 bucks with
that VGA video BG a second okay I think
I owned one of those but like years all
right
anyway I forget what we were even
talking about right I wouldn't buy NCIX
unless the price was basically what I
would have paid for the you two black
now tell me this I have had more than
one person pitch me internally that if
we were to buy the NCIX brand so what
first one thing do you think suppliers
would take the NCIX brand seriously if
it was me running it actually yeah and
if we were to buy it should we become a
system integrator hmm I wonder what
twitchchat thinks of this I think you'd
have to do it really well
well the idea would be that like I
wouldn't I wouldn't want to go crazy
like my perfect system builder would
probably be closer to puget than to like
I main gear expected that III buy really
well I didn't mean like hard water
cooling I meant like very low amounts of
issues yes
like robustness would have to be like a
way up there which puget yeah they've
got that they test after their testing
which is yep crazy but like just because
of the public facing mists of this
attachment company you'd have to be
quite careful yeah it would it would it
would be it would be one of those things
where you know every customer service
issue has the potential to go viral
you know like and and and my biggest
issue actually is just that there's the
potential for people to perceive our
Hardware choices in the NCIX PC division
as being influenced or or influencing
the media side of it so I think there's
a reason that nobody's ever really
crossed those lines except me yeah I was
already doing this and it's hilarious
because you see so many people harkening
for the good old days when Linus wasn't
biased because he worked at a computer
store that was trying to sell you stuff
and I'm sitting here going oh man like
like it's not it's not bias but you
could certainly find an ulterior motive
in there if you dug deep enough
LCI X - Computer Inc Inc
extreme X X Factor yeah so I don't know
man
I'm hoping to hear back today about just
sort of like the update but my my name's
out of the Hat I'm I'm not going to be
able to I'm not going to be able to get
my hands on the channel I had really
hoped to the chad is chanting yes it
does look like licks our computers don't
just suck they lick
hard that might go okay I'm like okay go
back to like mid-90s advertising like
just our branding just being completely
ridiculous yeah yeah I mean okay as far
as I can tell the only way system
integrators make any money is through
MDF programs with brands like Intel and
NVIDIA Nvidia probably I don't think
Intel would give us any money to talk
about our our computers lick hard
Intel's a little on the conservative
side when it comes to brand messaging
yeah to be oh man freak oh we're not
talking anything about politics at all
um we're just talking about speaking of
how we actually intend to continue
running our business
and making money yeah Squarespace oh I

the Richmond Olympic Oval it's gonna be
huge
it's a meet-up slash tech convention the
idea is to keep the focus on experiences
so we want you guys to get hands-on with
cool tech through fun games and
tutorials and there's gonna be a larger
focus on PC gaming this year tickets
start at 35 Canadian roubles and you can
check them out at l TX Expo com
hopefully we'll see we'll see a lot of
people there like last year it actually
went surprisingly well for a first
attempt like that's actual that's an
actual picture from last year yeah we
framed it really cleverly so you can't
see the empty chairs up here but like
that was fine because we never intended
to have people up there and yeah no one
wants to sit in the stands yeah they
want to rush the stands try to touch
your hands hmm like some screaming us
your fans yeah yeah yeah spaghetti yeah
spaghetti fans umm York fans this one's
good milk milk the fans full clean mmm
we'll get to that later I gotta do my
thing should I do that later now oh yes
oh right more plain news okay while you
talk though plain news while I show off
the site that totally works that's the
time all the videos that people well the
vast majority of the time yeah so check
this out so just just recently this this
got working so you can put it up here
got working magically magically um yeah
so you can click up here and you can see
all the videos in order from all the
channels you subscribe to like bit wit
ultra and Linus tech tips who are
currently the only creators on the
platform credit card payments work yeah
PayPal is still pending some stuff with
our page
processor brain tree but we are hoping
to be able to accept both through the
platform I've had no actual issues with
credit card payments yet really no
actual issues there's a lot of
placeholders and stuff still like go to
them this image is like not that great
no but I can show you guys the videos
that are up there we've got an inn table
and intel we've got a fast as possible
on Intel's
CPU letter so you know like XK uty all
those orders that come at the ends of
the name Zhu max builds her first PC
together with me much hilarity ensues
are you like getting her to do most of
it oh yeah nice oh yeah she does the
vast majority of it I barely touch it
nice um we've got a floatplane exclusive
testing the Nvidia shield from the NCIX
auction this case is unbelievable
like actually amazing it's like this
bill didn't do what it did last week
yeah no I know it's scanning it's still
slightly slower no I think it was
actually our connection here that would
make sense
um because Johnny came in earlier this
week and kind of reset everything
updated all the firmware and I haven't
been having buffering issues on
floatplane or YouTube this week okay
cool yeah so this is a gorgeous video
it's it's worth a watch let's go ahead
and go back usually I'd hope I'd be over
it by now it's still going not act ah
[Laughter]
this one went up on youtube today
this one went up already this is a fast
as possible you can't really tell cuz
the thumbnail is footage from the LTTE
video anyway don't worry about it
gaming on the iMac Pro how bad can it be
no I know you can I just haven't done it
um super ultra wide monitored anchored
um I think we all know the answer
actually I think everyone the funny
thing about that is it's very polarizing
I think everybody knows their own answer
and it's not the same answer as other
people it's just addressed yes I've had
people talk to me about how that is the
most amazing thing of all time me too
they can't believe nobody ever thought
of that like it's crazy so sorry what
was your news I'm floatplanes hiring are
we yeah
I've lightly mentioned it to you earlier
looking for someone attention with like
node angular sails waterline kind of
experience in that realm yeah hit me up
I don't have a specific like link for
you to go to right now you can tweet me
there will be a link you have a specific
budget in mind we can talk about it
offline
I do actually but yeah alright this will
bring the team up to how many then
that'll be five six five well that
depends on how you come to me seven with
you
eight with right nine with don't have
name is public yeah no let's let's not
count Nene Vaughn then accounting you
yeah yeah okay 676 it's crazy how many
people thought that we were just gonna
be like doing this with one person in
Luke okay yes but yeah that was never
the plan though yeah and and will that
initial call video we were we already
had one person so we were going up from
there but yeah we're doing we're doing
pretty well right now we're pushing
forward right now though were were in a
situation where we're doing a lot of
reacting so I want to increase the team
size a little bit so we can push forward
because we're reacting to some bugs
we're fixing some things or doing some
user suggestions and stuff but I want to
keep pushing forward at the mainline
stuff yeah we've got a really good
roadmap we just need to make sure we
don't fall into that trap where we've
got a great road matter crew yet we
never end up working and we we do keep
feature creeping basically everything
feature creeps and our stuff is featured
creeping as well but yeah cool oh yeah
being from Canada or being from the
states with a related degree is quite
important because I want to move you
here yeah so remote work no remote work
for three months yes while you're on
probation cool once you're off probation
no come here get on a plane yeah all
right why don't we talk about some
actual news is in the actual dock this
is supposed to by master disaster on the
forum and the original article
is from TechCrunch flippy the robot
hamburger chef goes to work so this is
one year after announcing a partnership
with Cal a burger and miso robotics is
resident chef graduated to graduated
hamburger University and started
flipping burgers in an actual restaurant
so this is an AI enabled burger flipping
robot arm thing it uses thermal imaging
and image recognition to tell which
burgers need flipping it can handle 12
burgers at a time and it's not a hundred
percent independent the worker has to
bring in patties and take the cooked
ones away apply cheese assemble
sandwiches actually it doesn't sound
that I think it's not right but the idea
was that for year $60,000 per flipy each
yeah and your 20% annual recurring
maintenance fee so 12 grand a year you
would get more functionality down the
road like the ability to chop deep-fry
grill or add seasoning and cheese to
patties
what drives me nuts is how can it not
refill the patty selection
look at what like even even if even if
workers had to bring like stacks of
patties separated by paper whatever
whatever I don't know
and just like load into a thing yeah
you'd think they'd have a burger hopper
yeah you know yeah so it was designed to
make up for the cost with decreased wait
times better consistency decreased food
waste and then obviously eventually a
reduction in staff but wait there's more
the original article from bbc.com burger
flipping robot taken offline after one
day on the job yes the burger flipping
robot lasted exactly as long as that
stoner guy that I hired when I was
running my painting business oh I
thought you meant all right oh no this
guy was hilarious I'm talking about but
yes there's more hilarious okay get this
okay so one of the most time-consuming
aspects of painting is ladder movements
okay
good getting up and down the ladder
moving the ladder over getting your
bucket and your paint back together and
getting up okay that's one of the things
that takes most amount of time so when I
see someone instead of putting so
instead of putting the ladder close to
the wall and using your whole wingspan
both hands when I see someone putting a
ladder four feet away from the wall
leaning in like this painting with one
hand like pushing themselves back out
onto the ladder I'm like oh this is one
of those like I don't know the proper
name for it but like you're not leaning
the ladder against was just a step stool
yeah he was just leaning himself against
the house you're like actually crew
chiefs wanted to kind of try and make it
work she's really she's a good person
I'm oddly bad at painting and that
sounds really dumb but as I said like we
were desperate like this was back in
no no 2006 six yeah probably around 2000
yeah was probably 2006 when like the
economy was really good the 2008 crash
hadn't really happened yet like it was
this was a time this was a period of
time we're getting walking into a subway
you might only hope to have your burger
made correctly because people who are
like desperate they were hiring just
like anyone no matter how qualified they
were for anything and it was really hard
to find people but I was just like no we
can't do this um so so so right
flippy-flippy was supposed to be able to
cook 2,000 burgers a day but after her
one day flipy was taken offline to be
upgraded to work faster left with a
little sign saying he'd be cooking soon
the employees that worked with him are
also being trained to help flippy work
faster it's likely that this is due to
the increased volume at the store due to
the news of flippy being deployed so
2008 sounds like a lot but when you
break it down it's really actually not
that much it's not that crazy and you
see in the video like his flippin thing
is very like its slump a good thing
about it is like you know what about
what's that robot called the four legged
one that you can like kick and it
doesn't fall over yeah I don't know but
it's Boston Dynamics yeah like that
thing's been around for six years this
does not seem very sophisticated or good
why does it cost sixty thousand dollars
I'm not this I'm sure they're not mass
making them that's why this one's nuts
crazy new yeah oh wow Boston Dynamics
has a new robot that's like kind of news
right it's sure it's been news for a
while we're kind of late it happened
like it can't open a door and you can
like screw with it while it tries to
open the door and it old correct and
it'll brace and it does always lookin so
why is it lagging OH
see it'll like bring out arm thing you
where the arm actually comes from oh
there's the one with the arm right this
one I select the other one through the
door these guys are like this is scary
stuff this is like straight out of
portal me and then he like braces the
door on his leg gets the arm around the
door and then pulls it open let's the
other one through and then I think what
we're gonna see after this is when they
try to interfere because Boston Dynamics
is all about that oh no ok is this one
test me robustness yeah yeah no it's
fine I mean that's like anyway but the
point I was trying to make is like I
don't really understand why flippy
there's crazy robots out there this
feels like a really advanced like
project that someone on YouTube made I
don't know I'm sure it's more
complicated than that I'm sure the
thermal sensing stuff is actually quite
complicated right like the like the
robot vision that they've programmed
into this is probably pretty cool and
there's probably some pretty like some
pretty onerous sort of safety health and
safety certifications all right yeah
well at any rate um I don't move on to
the next topic so right so humans um
your jobs are not safe except for now
they are because flippy is not that
great but that one will make it good
flippy this is pretty crazy so this was
posted by master disaster on the forum
but and the original poll article is is
this like from our form looks like one
of the users of our forum blanked out
their personal information and said
basically dear taxpayer Newegg has
provided the Department of Revenue
Services records of your online
purchases they put a dash in online
because apparently they still live in
2002 yeah during taxable years 2014 2015
and 2016 according to these records you
made purchases in at least one of these
years but we're not charged Connecticut
sales tax therefore you owe tax on the
items tax interest penalty
total amount due a hundred and three
dollars and ten cents now this is based
on only spending about a thousand
bucks so anyone who was a heavy buyer or
like maybe was the the coordination
point for group buys for their friends
for example or like regularly bought
systems and built them for other people
if they didn't go and pour through the
Connecticut tax code to determine that
new eggs should have been paying them
tax or should have been submitting
charging them tax and then submitting it
to the state of Connecticut they could
be on the hook for thousands and
thousands of dollars American online tax
law is basically as far as I know
actually the worst out of anyone it's
pretty broken and like the average
person I don't think the average person
should be blamed for not being aware of
this stuff like on the one hand yes
officially according to tax laws here in
Canada - you should pay tax even if you
weren't charged tax on the transaction
for example if I were to buy something
on Craigslist or if I was sorry if I
were to sell something on Craigslist I'm
supposed to pay income tax on the the
money that I made and if I was to sell
something on Craigslist I am supposed to
I think over a certain amount so if I
was doing it regularly I am supposed to
collect provincial and general sales tax
and submit it to the appropriate
governing bodies on behalf of the buyer
but like going all the way back to 2014
to 2016 and then just sending letters to
everyone Wow
no subpoena or warrant was involved the
DRS just sent you a letter they complied
which I mean yeah dude would they have a
legal justification - no yeah I mean I
guess that's people's personal
information right like that's pretty BS
yeah
well how would they do mail he sent the
amount how do they be able to mail them
with their personal information yeah so
name address yeah so okay so apparently
the DRS submitted the names and
addresses and asked Newegg for the
amounts so okay i can see new eggs
supplying that but I don't know man like
this is one of those things where this
is not the consumers fault NH Massacre
said I'm screwed I spent over 13 K on
new egg are you from Connecticut I think
you have to I think this only applies to
people this only applies to Connecticut
for now but this is a can of worms
yeah because even here in Canada the way
that the taxation has worked for online
purchases has been a little bit
complicated at times and as far as I
know nothing was ever done retro
actively and as far as I know when the
laws changed back in 2008-2009 some
somewhere around there when they in
troost Harmon introduced harmonized
sales tax yeah the onus was on the
retailer to deal with it yeah we were
the ones who were in trouble and that
seems a lot more fair to me than putting
it on you know individual yeah yeah Joe
average in Connecticut no I completely
agree i crap wasn't gonna say right so a
lot of tax law was made before it was
reasonable to buy something in one area
when you are in another area and then
when that started becoming more popular
it was mostly like calling in to order
stuff and that was such low volume that
you don't have cared and even once you
started buying things on the internet
most people were pretty skeptical about
buying things on the internet and there
wasn't a lot of that going on and then
Amazon blows up and all these other
sites blow up and now a lot of people
are doing a pretty hefty portion
possibly most of their shopping on the
internet yeah now it's a big deal
because I mean remember it's not like
we're in a situation where the
individual states are just like flush
with cash yeah so if they can find a way
to get you know anywhere between a
couple of percent and
couple more than that percent of every
transaction that takes place online for
items coming into their state I mean
think about it
those items don't get to the door
without a truck driving on a road that
theoretically the state maintains like
someone said Luke used tax covers
out-of-state purchases I'm assuming the
mean US tax not really this is you know
he said us e either way it doesn't no
not in all cases and there's really
weird situations where like for for if
you're talking about digital stuff if if
if the company you're buying something
from has a server in your state
that's Nexus so they have a like
location there which changes how it all
were it's a very very complicated and it
varies depending on whether it's a
digital goods or service or a physical
item yeah and like it varies per state
per county in some places like yes it's
it's actual US tax is extremely
complicated all right speaking of things
that are extremely complicated my
feelings about this latest bit of news
the original thing about use tax it
doesn't matter there's other things that
apply sorry that I got that part wrong
there is still other stuff that applies
mcafee acquires VPN company which I
actually didn't realize was Canadian was
tunnel bear dun-dun-duh in terms of the
deals have not been disclosed
McAfee says it plans to integrate tunnel
bears technologies into their own VPN
products that I've never heard of until
now safe connect apparently tunnel bear
will also continue to work on its own
products under its own brand according
to the report tunnel bear is a
profitable company so presumably McAfee
paid a pretty penny for it just a little
bit of history McAfee was acquired by
Intel in 2011 caffiene McAfee whatever
Intel for branded it to Intel security
and then it was later split into a new
company with all
McAfee McAfee whatever name wave in
partnership with private equity firm TPG
so this is their second acquisition
since becoming a separate company again
and so here's where we're at on this as
you guys probably know tunnel bear is a
a pretty has been a long time supporter
right of the show yeah um so we've
reached out to them for comment I don't
think we've heard back yet
I'm actually not not sure if we've heard
back yet but we would we would love to
we would love to hear from our community
what they think of this news so one key
change is now that tunnel bear is owned
by an American interest they will have
to comply with some American laws as far
as I know I mean so that's one
difference that there might be to the
service yeah and their way of operating
chime in slightly here
Canada has a lot of crazy privacy laws
to the US privacy laws are more well
documented but if you want to have some
fun google spy palace it'll bring up
some Canadian stuff interesting articles
so yeah in five eyes so that was some
interesting news um in other interesting
news this is supposed to Bison re on the
forum the original article is from
overclock net modders have apparently
gotten coffee lake working on one
hundred and two hundred series chipsets
so far the core i3 8100 has been tested
working completely on a 100 series board
mmm well apparently multiple 100 series
boards and what else do we have here so
little heal contributed in adding the
coffee like CPU microcode and
suggestions of using correct any version
to boot the CPU root user one two three
fixed I GPU by extracting coffee like I
GPU V BIOS on the latest GOP driver from
Sonic's and updating the V BIOS on GP
driver Wow contributed to Sankey
contributed in booting six core CPU on
MSI z 270 motherboard and giving lots of
assistance in solving problems LSW
contributed and testing and writing
guides mob ax solved the issue with the
PCIe 16x not working and CPU voltage
real fixes when using coffee like CPUs
very very interesting
eBay GPU adds you got going on there
because of higher power limits this is a
quote here I would not suggest this mod
with I 5 and i7k series CPUs so this
comes back to I'm not talking to you
serie going so this comes back to the
speculation that took place when Intel
said they would not be supporting coffee
lake on 100 and 200 series but I'm gonna
go through Jake's notes here first as a
courtesy
oh actually that was the first thing in
his notes good job dig so here's what
they said it might have worked for the
most part but it didn't work well enough
or reliably enough for Intel to allow
this compatibility to make it to the
market so they software and BIOS locked
off the compatibility most of this was
due to coffee lakes different power
setup it
was not necessarily that the board
didn't have enough power delivery but
the board's power delivery to is
distributed over more pins to better
support coffee like six core chips like
the 8700 K so WCC F Tech reported that
ground pins went from 377 to 391 and
power pins went from 128 to 146
something a lot of people don't know is
that on particularly a brand-new CPU
like I found a really good I forget why
I was looking at this but I 7 9 20 pins
cool this blog re engine blog check this
out I forget what I was looking at this
but this is a map I posted brought on
re-engined org where this guy or gal
mapped out what all of the different
pins are and then color-coded them so
you can see here all this green stuff is
memory controller all this blue stuff is
qpi data all the gray stuff so like 7080
percent of what's in here a bunch of
this in here here probably a good 50% of
what's in here all that gray stuff is
reserved pins and those reserved pins
might be for different SKUs that have
more hardware in them for example this
is a bloomfield and so it was
architectural II very similar to the
contemporaries eons so those eons would
have had an additional qpi link that
would have taken up probably let's go
back here probably all the gray ones
here yeah that would have been the other
qpi link for the other CPU that would
have been needed but there's still all
this other stuff and a lot of the time
those reserved pins are just in case
intel decides to do like a new CPU with
I don't know maybe more coarse for
example they can use those for something
so this is just an example of them
utilizing reserved pins in order to add
more power so going back to our notes
here the modders say that the pin out
doesn't matter because they're just left
disk
because those pins are reserved on KB
Lake except for to which you can just
cover with tape so the extra pins offer
about eight percent greater impedance so
theoretically lower power chips like the
i3 8100 are fine but you may have issues
with overclockable higher core count or
higher TDB chips there's a screenshot
here of an 8700 k working so you can
check this out on a presumably MSI board
but no actual evidence of it running
correctly or stabili so there you go
it's exactly what I don't know if Intel
ever publicly said it that was it but
that's what we understood it's exactly
what we knew it was it's not that it
can't work it's that it can't work well
enough so unless you try super super
hard and use an i3 8100 just probably
not worth the work so that's where we're
at on that yeah what else we got here
anything there's not a lot to say here
but I think it's kind of interesting pub
G has been rocking for a long time and a
lot of people in the community including
myself are pretty unsatisfied with how
they've been kind of doing a lot of
stuff for the uninitiated why their
servers are super garbage they're down
times that they choose for maintenance
even when they scheduled at ahead of
time is it in like prime time for North
America which is pretty rough and they
do all the servers there's a huge amount
of hacking and that's not being dealt
with to a satisfactory level including
hacks like something called ESP which is
like do you member the Pokemon go
cheating stuff where people would get
like a website and it would show where
all the Pokemon are you can get that
except for pub G so it shows you where
everyone in the map is and you can get
it running on an external computer so
you don't even need to have it on your
computer so there's no way to detect it
because you can just VPN the other
device they'd have no idea it's going to
your net
right so they even if they did find a
way to track it somehow which I don't
think they could then you get his VPN
and there's no way for them to check it
anyways because it has like fundamental
flaws it's a huge there's a lot of
issues there's there's things that piss
a lot of people off and it yeah they
took all this money that they got for
having a successful game and instead of
when what a lot of people think needed
to happen is throwing all of that
towards development of the main game
they developed like a mobile game and
then they did this huge push to get it
on to Xbox and like all this kind of
stuff instead of developing the core
thing they had a version 1.0 released
which was as far as I can tell a giant
publicity stunt because it was garbage
there was still huge amounts of issues
in the game like it's it's it's been
really frustrating you drop in you have
to parachute in I know you haven't
really played I don't know how much you
know about it you have to parachute in
and you'll you sometimes you have to
stand there for a little while and wait
for things to actually spawn like loot
sometimes it's there who knows it might
not work you try to parachute into the
ground might not let you out of the
parachute then when it does it might
just kill you or do a whole bunch of
damage cuz it's like oh you fell it's
like wanted to fall in if the game
worked thanks there's huge rubber
banding issues for a huge amount of time
there's massive performance issues
there's still some performance issues
but not as much as there was before tell
me how you really feel about it
meanwhile and I'm not as into the
gameplay cuz I don't like the building
aspects and stuff but fortnight Wright
released their battle royale mode after
pub G running on the same engine because
they made it and it's it's a what a lot
of people classify a better overall
experience I'm not as into the gameplay
somewhat like the building aspects if
you like actively build walls and do all
this weird stuff and some of the fights
are just ridiculous to watch because you
just watch people like rapidly build
walls and stairs and stuff like super
super super super super super fast and
like the one shot okay it's over because
you like somehow got an angle on them
while they were rapidly building this
thing - I
yeah I'm not super into the gameplay but
I'm kind of happy that it's beating out
pub G because I want them to smart in
the heck out
because I would rather play that game
it's just really frustrating sometimes
anyways I don't know how much the twitch
town actually agrees with me we should
do a poll tell you like more pub G or
all right for night I'm on it
so I I like playing pub G more but I get
very angry when like I'll rubber band
around a wall or I'll be like clearly
behind something and die and it's not
the other the other dude isn't hacking
or anything it's just huge latency
issues the the tick rate on the servers
is garbage I don't remember what it is
now but it was like 11 to 17 before
really like it's it's really bad why
this is something you know maybe you can
explain this to me from a technical
standpoint why run a crappy tick rate
when everyone knows what would be better
okay so in like October they were saying
17 Hertz tick rate really yeah how can
you even play a competitive game like
that yeah like there's issues with the
game and the a lot of its just ignored
more people are voting for fortnight
right now it's really close to be fair
Wow these votes are coming really really
fast and a lot of people like compared
to most polls we run yeah this is crazy
but then you think about it we're
streaming on Twitch most of the time
we're not going variables that's fair
yeah yeah so it's close which I'm not
surprised by right but fortnight is
edging out pub G which shouldn't be
surprising exactly and I I prefer the
gameplay style of pub G and all this
kind of stuff there's just so many
frustrating things
anyways which hard time to play games
well they didn't really do so
in other news game over for drones
that's bad
a drone crashed in Arizona National
Forest
starting a wildfire 200 acres 200 acres
that burned 300 acres over 300 acres
with 30 firefighters able to contain it
within the day that's how much it burned
in a day and it's unclear what kind of
drone it was but it caught fire when it
crashed a setting fire to a grassland
area called Kendrick Park the pilot was
identified and charged with starting a
forest fire lawmakers are pushing to
criminalize drone flying in wildfire
areas so basically you're not gonna be
able to fly a drone near a person near
an animal near a vehicle near a wildfire
area which is like what isn't yeah um a
spokesperson for the forest said it is
legal to fly a drone in the forest as
long as it doesn't take off in a
wilderness area and as long as there are
no nearby wildfires so I don't know how
you're gonna turn this into a criminal
charge against the guy oh wait no okay
yeah you can yeah okay so I guess is it
negligence I guess so cuz I think I feel
like you'd have to have precautions
along the road so if nothing else you'd
have to have like people I would along
the route because I bet you film crews
would still be able to get away with it
interesting because they could have like
crew around just in case the drone fell
yeah
so here's another good one
goodbye drones goodbye porn um rhode
island is proposing a bill requiring
internet service providers to block
sexual content and not necessarily for
the reason you might think because you
would probably go it's probably a think
of the children but what they really
want is to get twenty dollars from you
one time some one time feet twenty
dollars from you to be able to access
pornography which will give money to the
state to help fund the operation of the
council on human trafficking you have to
send in a request in writing that you
want it disabled you have to present
your ID to verify that you're older than
eighteen and you have to acknowledge
receiving written warning regarding the
danger associated with deactivating the
filter Wow yeah
so that's interesting with current
wording it seems like the filters for
illegal things like child porn would
also be deactivated if he paid the fee
what how does that help the problem that
they do okay yeah completely regardless
of the moral issues of blocking anything
on the Internet to any degree whatever
whatever whatever completely ignore all
of that kind of stuff for now just look
at the stance they're trying to make and
the result that they're setting up they
don't line up that's that's completely
what I'm confused about right now
unlocked yeah unzipped
but that's just awkward and like it
sounds like you have to maybe do it in
person cuz that's being writing you have
to acknowledge that you've seen this
form saying that you're a bad person
essentially and you have to present your
ID it says present ID not like so my
understanding is that human trafficking
and effectively slavery is actually a
huge problem in the porn industry I
don't do a ton of research on it what
like apparently people can end up and
like not so much in North America I
don't think but people can end up
signing contracts without fully
understanding them that basically turned
them into sex slaves that sounds less
likely in North America yeah and so I
can understand the need to sort of
investigate where this internet porn is
coming from the impact it's having and
if there are illegal activities going on
that are driving it but I don't think
that like an internet censorship bill
makes a ton of sense as the way to go
about that that seems sort of like a
broader
yeah once again another topic that I'm
really just not sure what to say about I
just don't understand like is this the
worst thought-out thing ever like that
that's the only thing that's the only
conclusion I'm really coming to you like
if regardless of your stance on it
whether you're for it or against it
their approach is super confusing okay
so we've got people correcting me saying
that bringing people into the into North
America to act as slaves is still pretty
common yeah it's it's a little bit
different though so in North America the
way that typically this is my
understanding the way that the human
trafficking game typically works is that
you're relying on their very poor
language skills and the fact that they
don't understand bility to the laws of
the country in order to get themselves
out of it but that's not really what I
was talking about I was talking about
situations where actually through legal
contracts you're creating situations
where people are effectively being
sexually assaulted at work every day but
they're contractually obligated to
continue to do it so yeah okay so thanks
for watching guys
this has been an interesting Rancho you
will see you show
same bat-time same bat-channel y
messed up man stuff man
yeah
it's just like wonder what are you gonna
do ask
lending to left
yeah I heard I heard that that was what
if the White House's top priorities
stopping the sexual harassment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
