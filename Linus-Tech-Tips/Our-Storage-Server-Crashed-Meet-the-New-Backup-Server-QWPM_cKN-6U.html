about the catastrophic failure of the
raid array on our 2010 byte SSD server
codename Wanek but before we do that
video why don't we take a moment to
introduce to you the newest member of
the Linus Media Group server family the
one I was literally in the process of
backing Wanek up to when the failure
happened meet plover server the Logitech
G 303 features a lightweight design and
advanced optical sensor with Delta zero
technology for precise tracking and RGB
lighting to match your setup check out
the link in the video description to
learn more so I think a video about
clover server has to start with the
differences between backup and
redundancy redundancy protects from a
hardware failure to an extent but not
from accidental deletion encryption by
ransomware vandalism or what I would
call catastrophic hardware failure the
benefit of redundancy is that it's real
time a single Drive failure in a raid 5
array for example would allow the
business to keep operating completely
normally and would result in 0 lost data
as long as it could be offloaded or the
raid array could be rebuilt with backups
you'll only get back whatever was in
your last periodic backup so clover
server wouldn't have prevented any data
loss from the catastrophic raid failure
that recently occurred with Wanek server
one of the raid cards crapped all over
the inside of its pants took its pants
off and started swinging them around
what it would have prevented was
projects that have already been shot
weeks ago but not yet edited like this
video that we had planned for Channel
super-fun from being entirely lost so
let's take a look at the hardware
clover server is using a quad-core xeon
processor on an asus p9 DM server
motherboard with 32 gigs
kingston ECC ddr3 memory to give me the
best possible stability of course the
redundant power supply from ISTAR USA
helps with that and the tool list case
well okay that's just for convenience
but the hot swappable drive bays are
really really nice
ignore that RAID controller you see in
this footage that's going to be replaced
with an LSI HBA and I've also added a
ten gigabit network card to handle the
workload alterations that I've made
since I built this box for storage I've
gone with eight of Seagate's
eight terabyte enterprise capacity
drives these suckers do in the
neighborhood of 200 megabytes per second
and have a rated mean time between
failure of two million hours however
whatever the reliability might be in
this particular application where the
intent is to achieve reasonable speed
but more importantly extraordinarily
safe backup remember this will be the
only copy of some data in the event of
Wanek pooping itself again I'll be
giving up a lot of my capacity to the
redundancy gods as well as the speed
gods so like most of our servers these
days the software side of things starts
with a fresh install of lime Tech's on
raid which by the way they have
sponsored projects of ours but this
isn't one of them so we'll be setting up
two of our eight terabyte drives in what
is effectively an eight terabyte raid 1
array configuration and then we'll take
the other six in a butter FS raid 10 for
24 terabytes of redundant storage the
plan for the 8 terabyte array is pretty
straightforward
I'm going to set up a Windows Server
2012 r2 essentials VM a pretty simple
process since I don't have to do any
video card pass-through or anything like
that if you want to learn more though
about on raid VN setup you can check out
our to gamers 1 cpu video here I chose
essentials 2012 r2 because even though
it's quite expensive at about $500 for a
license the way it handles incremental
backup and restore functionality for up
to 25 computers is really slick and
seamless not to mention that if we ever
wanted to move to a domain setup it
includes Active Directory domain
services
for now we're still using a workgroup so
I did have to use this simple workaround
to enable the nightly backup
functionality without requiring the PCs
to join a domain from there you download
and setup the connector software and
this is basically a quick look at the
dashboard that allows you to set the
schedule for nightly backups how long
you want to keep them for and change the
storage destination to the secondary V
disks that I created for those backups
so seven terabytes should be lots for
our SSD equipped workstations here in
the office
alright then Linus but what about that
24 terabytes of RAID 10 storage on this
machine great question
I've got two plans for that number one
is to use beyond compare a great piece
of software that compares the structure
of two directories and allows you to set
up all kinds of rules for copying one
way copying the other way or
synchronizing between them and I'm going
to use that to do incremental
synchronizations so this is kind of
somewhere between redundancy and backup
since I plan to run them every 30
minutes or so and I'm setting up the
relationship so that a deleted file on
Wanek will be removed on the clover
server side as well then every night I
will set up a backup operation from
clover to the vault where files deleted
from Wanek and therefore clover server
will not be removed from the vault so we
have somewhere to turn to if we
accidentally delete something major
so those operations can both be
scheduled simply with windows task
manager super handy and then a monthly
or whenever we feel like it cleansing of
the deleted stuff on the vault can be
done using beyond compare as well
now this isn't a perfect solution but
butter FS snapshotting is still a ways
out so it'll have to do for now and
we've got lots of space on the vault so
I'm not too worried about it
anyway that still only accounts for
about another 20 terabytes of the space
on clover so we've got 5 terabytes of
wiggle room for that plan number two I'm
going to be leveraging my CEO nests to
use that extra space as an off-site
backup for my nas at home using
CrashPlan normally I'd actually have to
run crash plan from within a win
environment or at least something with a
GUI but the benefit of using docker
within unready to do it I do plan to do
a full video about docker containers and
why they're awesome in the future is
that if windows Bork's up crash plans
backing up of key files there's not
enough left over space for my whole home
array will be uninterrupted normally
setting up crash plan on a headless
machine is kind of a nightmare but
unraised way is a bit more elegant so in
summary there's three main points for
this video
one backups are important to create two
backups of something that's important
during a data migration and three more
details on the catastrophic raid failure
to come speaking of catastrophic have
you ever been in a situation where
you're like I want to watch American
Netflix but I am NOT American or I am
American and I'm not in America
well Tunnel bear is the easy to use VPN
app for that and all kinds of stuff
Tunnel bear lets you tunnel to 16
different countries allowing you to
browse the Internet and use online
services as if you are in a different
country
they've got apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac and they've also got a Chrome
extension when you pick a country and
turn tunnel bear on two things happen
your connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and your public IP
address gets switched so that you show
up as if you are in that other country
and they've fixed all the annoying stuff
that's frustrating about VPNs while
offering 500 megabytes of data for free
to try it out with no credit card
required then if you want to upgrade to
unlimited data you can save 10% by going
to tunnel bear comm slash ltte which is
linked in the video description alright
