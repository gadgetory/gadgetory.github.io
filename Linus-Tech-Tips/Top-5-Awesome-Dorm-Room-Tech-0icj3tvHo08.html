Linus's empty warehouse gaming skit with
their short throw projector was pretty
cool except he left thousands of dollars
worth of equipment behind when he left
but his second idea to go with their
battery powers drawer Thor projector and
have a look at five handy tech items for
a college dorm life had an even bigger
problem Linus has never lived in a dorm
so here I go
let's start with item number one the
bose qc25 wireless headphones one of the
first things you'll notice about dorm
life is the incredibly thin walls and
your neighbors in every direction are
probably enjoying their first taste of
life out from under their mom and dad's
roof eavesdropping on conversations may
be fun the first few days and the
rabbets next door could be interesting
for a bit too I'm not judging but after
a couple weeks you're probably just
going to want some quiet time to
yourself the noise cancellation on the
QC 35 s is nothing short of amazing
they're very comfortable and with ample
padding for long studying sessions and
they'll last the whole time - with Bose
boasting 20 hours of active listening I
single charge sorry for that pun this
isn't the first in the QC lineup Bose
has been doing this whole quiet comfort
thing for a while now and it isn't
likely to come to a surprise to owners
of the QC 15 or QC 25 but the bottom
line is QC 35 s are expensive but
undeniably awesome moving on to number
two the Google chromecast now I'm
probably preaching to the choir here but
if you had to leave the family one at
home now might be a great time to pick
up either the updated gen 2 model or
even the brand new 4k model s
Millennials love to show each other
internet memes and random videos this is
just a fact of life and there's no
easier way to do this wirelessly than
with a chromecast it's light enough to
hang out of your HDMI port on your
display without harming it and with just
a micro USB plug required for power it's
both easy to set up and easy to use it
works with Android 4.1 or higher iOS a
point o or higher Mac OS 10.9 or higher
and Windows 7 or higher so regardless of
your tech budget you're probably covered
now you just need something to plug it
into right which brings us to item
number 3 the LG pH 450 ug an ultra short
throw LED projector with an embedded
battery but Luke why would you want a
portable projector you're in eighth
or room just plug it in okay I hear that
but there's this this concept it's
called leaving your dorm room now I
hadn't heard of it till recently in my
college years I only left my dorm room
for sustenance education or to do my
laundry but I do understand that certain
Homo sapiens will venture outwards to
gather in consumed libations and
participate in other various social
activities in such scenarios one may
gain higher social rank within the herd
by showing up with a portable projector
it's even possible that such a scenario
may lead to romance or what I call
popularity plus with the desirable mate
all right all jokes aside having a
projector in your dorm would be badass
and the portability afforded to you by
the built-in battery could be wildly
useful bring it along to a study group
room that doesn't have a power plug is a
much more elegant solution to sharing
notes and collaboration its size makes
moving it around easier than you'd
expect and like it's bigger brother from
our last video its ultra short throw so
you can get 40 inches of screen size
just 2.9 inches away from the wall and
on the subject of studying your dorm
life and just being in post-secondary
education in general will very possibly
launch the biggest boom of incoming
communication that you have ever
experienced managing this will be
distracting feeling your phone buzz
pulling it out unlocking and opening the
right app typing out some super hot fire
memes to impress that person you like
ending up on Facebook for an hour when
you're just going to look at that one
damn thing which brings us to item
number four the logitech k7 80 multi
device keyboard can simplify this
process it's a Bluetooth keyboard with
low profile keys so the typing
experience is somewhat similar to a
laptop but that kind of thing is
everywhere its main feature is its
ability to hot-swap its connectivity
between three devices like a computer a
phone and a tablet it even has a handy
rail near the top to store your phone
meaning you could be sitting at your
computer working with your phone propped
up and plugged in with the screen Oh
is on hot-swap when you get a message
type out your reply and move on with
your work less downtime now no one does
top force five is the magic number and I
was struggling to come up with another
one
thankfully as I was throwing this
together the night before the due date I
had a hankering that inspired me
nongshim spicy kimchi flavored bowl
noodle now you might argue this isn't a
piece of tech fare but it's awesome
nonetheless even one of the top helpful
reviews on Amazon titled it great for
hungry college students if you are what
you eat I think at one point in my life
I was probably 25% techie dude and 75%
nongshim noodles I highly recommend them
as long as you don't mind that they
certainly almost contain no nutrients
whatsoever and probably about two times
the recommended daily intake of salt
depending on how many of them you eat
per day for me it might have been near
eight times right now I'm not worried
about that however because I'm about 95%
done hosting this video so all that's
left to say here is that hopefully these
suggestions will help you enjoy your
dorm experience or just life in general
if you're past that whole dorm phase let
me know what you guys think in the
comments down below or at Linus tech on
Twitter thanks for watching I'll see you
next time if you're interested in any of
these things
check out Amazon in the link of the
description down below or even one of
these shirts but I don't think we have
polos for sale so oh well
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
