brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom glass for the best
darn screen protectors out there as well
as hyperx now this might not really look
like anything new this is a gigabyte
brix s so I think the S is for storage
or something like that because it
supports an MSA to drive as well as a
tuna half inch hard drive or SSD but
what special here is what's going on
under the hood this is one of the first
systems available featuring an intel
Broadwell cpu so that is a 14 nanometer
cpu giving us effectively well the word
on the street is around a twenty percent
improvement in performance on both the
CPU and the GPU so as much power and as
impressive as it was that gigabyte was
able to stick into a little tiny box
like this before it gets even better now
we haven't seen updates yet to I can't
grab that one because it's bolted to the
table doesn't mean I won't try B we
haven't seen updates to the bricks
gaming yet but I wouldn't be surprised
if we see that coming very very soon
yeah I wasn't doing a very good
impression of drinking from this thing I
don't know who's touched I don't
actually want to put it against my mouth
but along the lines of bricks they've
got another demo here that might not be
anything new in terms of hardware this
is the same bricks gaming that we
actually reviewed a while back ago a
while back ago with the gtx 760 and a
fourth-generation core series processor
in it but the point they're trying to
make here is that bricks isn't just
necessarily about gaming and it's not
just necessarily about the absolute
smallest you know most compact but maybe
not most powerful PC it's about
sometimes finding a balance between the
two so they're showing it off in use as
more of a more of a workstation where
some 3d modeling is being done and then
translated to this 3d printer over here
from Orion that was used to print out
this cup which and I believe it
apparently took absolutely forever as
well as some other cool knickknacks
right here but while bricks is cool and
you know you throw a little bit of
memory you throw a drive in there and
you're like ready to rock with your full
PC on some people demand a little bit
more and gigabyte is addressing those
people who need a very powerful
workstation with modern functionality
you that Mac users have been enjoying
for quite some time but that for the PC
guys has been a little bit harder to
obtain so right here they have their g1
gaming x99 motherboard this is one of
their highest end motherboards like ever
and they've got it running with you know
a standard you know g1 gaming GTX 980
graphics card but wait what's this over
here this is a thunderbolt display that
is actually running not only the display
signal over a thunderbolt cable but then
it is actually daisy chained to a
handful of Thunderbolt enabled
peripherals over here well how did they
do that because Thunderbolt inherently
doesn't carry a display signal you need
DisplayPort built-in well they've got a
little dongle little pci bracket thing
that you're going to be able to use with
gigabyte motherboards it should be
available sometime in the first quarter
of 2015 that will enable you to take
DisplayPort out of your graphics card
into this adapter and then thunderball
out from your pc into up to six
connected devices including a monitor
all daisy-chained together so here
they've got an LG 34 um 95 running as
well as an ultra studio 4k from black
magic and a couple of let's see external
storage devices so speaking of external
storage devices you'll need to
externally store all the gratitude
you'll have for me telling you about
phantom glass wow we're segue ever so
our sponsor this year our main
presenting sponsor is phantom glass you
can find them over at store phantom dog
glass to make fantastic screen
protectors are made out of Gorilla Glass
just like the glass that's already on
the front of your phone that means they
are perfectly clear they are scratch
resistant they have that same oleophobic
coating so they don't get all grimy and
you can't even clean them off no matter
what and they're super easy to apply
it's pretty much impossible to get a
bubble under them and they can even be
taken off and reapplied if you're
careful with them if you need to arm a
your phone or something like that so
check out the link in the video
description to learn more about that and
to get one for yourself today also in
the video description is a link to hyper
exes youtube channel they're one of our
other sponsors here at the show it's
youtube.com slash hyperx they've got a
lot of great gaming content over there
be sure to check that out and also make
sure you're subscribed to Linus tech tip
