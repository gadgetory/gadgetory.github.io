hard to say if this qualifies for more
the tech channel or the cat channel this
is the Sphero from or bought Ock's and
basically what it is is if you check out
the green one that's out there in the
track that they've set up that's the one
that I'm controlling with this ipod
touch and i'm just going to bring it
around back to hello everybody at the
sphere of moons we're about to start
another spew so this is jonathan's
Bureau and I'd like him to explain just
a little bit what the heck is going on
with this thing out is how do i set this
up and get this working so sphere is the
smartphone control robotic all works on
Android and iOS and how you'd be amazing
work it is you shake it to wake it up
and it's gonna believe three colors you
connect to it over Bluetooth and then
you can drive it around we have over 20
different apps and games that you can
use either control Sphero or you can
actually a sphere as a controller and
took it in your hand to try the coraline
Idol star addition we have some new
augmented reality games that have just
come out like Sharky de beaver and the
Rolling Dead which we just announced do
you want to drive in the race okay let's
uh let's sort of let's sort of focus on
how you actually managed to race
multiples of these things at a time how
the heck do you know which one you're
connecting to so when you connect to it
you can actually bring up the Bluetooth
screen here and there we go so you can
see there's a bunch of different sphere
I was like blue yellow blue green red
red purple orange red white purple white
so when you wake up your sphere it's
going to flash the three color code and
you know which one to connect to so if
you and your brother both this year on
Christmas morning you'll know which one
you need to connect to out up perfect
now how durable is this thing is it
appropriate as a cat toy I mean grew up
for my dog even oh yes my dog chews on
it all the time in fact so I'm
actually take it stand on it on the
floor and I'm putting all my weight on
that one foot and I'm not crushing it
and you can actually just throw it out
there and if you go back to the home
screen there and relaunch the app you'll
be able to drive it around just fine Wow
very cool stuff okay so how much does
one of these cost retails for 129 it's
available at the apple store all right
stone and car gear now do I have to
control it with the joypad or do I have
other options so if you press this
button down here you can actually switch
it into tilt mode so now you hold it
flat it's gonna say sill but as you told
that it's gonna drive in whichever
direction you tilt it so unlike an RC
car there isn't an obvious front of the
Sphero so how does it know that when I
tilt it this way it needs to move away
from me so when you first start playing
with it you actually have to aim it so
you press this button right here my
guards is behind the pillar alright so
we got all our Spiros on a little light
comes on we point that blue light
towards us and then Sphero knows we're
dating and relationship new late this
way cuz we are going clockwise so this
was the sphere from warbot Ock's win
don't miss any of our CES 2013 coverage
and as always don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips you have a we
actually didn't make it away from the or
buttocks booth just yet they have an
augmented reality game with their little
ball device here that doesn't look like
a ball anymore at all in fact it looks
well if you look down at the ground it
looks like a ball but if you look at the
screen that's taking a feed from the
ipad being held by fabrizio here it is a
beaver that is running around on the
ground so you guys are replacing with
the camera on the iPad the ball with
this beaver model yeah that's correct
yep yeah so we're tracking the ball and
every frame and using it to figure out
where the ball is where the camera is
and that allows us to draw any kind of
3d content we want in this app we just
draw over the ball but we have other
apps where we draw other objects in
zombies come up out of the ground coins
to collect all sorts of things now you
showed us here do you want to just turn
yourself so that oh yeah I guess here
just bringing up yeah that can there you
go there you go so now
you can see what he looks like he
actually gets bigger as the ball gets
closer can you take them a little bit
further away from us so that we can see
how yeah there we go so we can see how
he gets smaller as he gets further away
so you have a game where you can chuck
cupcakes to them and you can fling them
quite a distance in order to try to feed
mr. Sharkey over there is that correct
alright so guy is very very cool down
though it goes beyond just sort of you
know racing it around on a track I mean
this is more of a tech demo at this
point but you guys have plans to
continue to develop this in the future
the next year we're going to build this
out i mean the gameplay opportunities
are really huge you know you can
multiplayer replace it with you know any
kind of avatar you want drop static
objects in your living room and go visit
them later it's sort of crazy lots of
lots of lots of opportunity for
innovation very cool stuff guys don't
miss any of our CES 2013 coverage make
sure you're subscribed to Linus tech
