before from max anomic and dxracer you
can see those reviews here but this time
around we were approached by a Rosie a
Swedish company that wanted us to check
out their Torretta
excel you may have noticed at one point
or another that I'm a fair bit larger
than Linus and given that the treta
excel is and I quote one of the first
chair is designed for people that need a
larger and wider chair I thought I'd
check it out and just a reminder to stay
subscribed because the conclusion of the
$300 budget PC scrapyard wars is coming
out this Saturday at midnight or more
specifically probably sometime Sunday
morning
save one select Intel 730 SSDs during
Intel's president's week sale February
22nd to March 1st 2015
click now to learn more let's start with
the packaging and assembly experience
there was some sort of fairly thin foam
around most the metal arms of the chair
which seemed to do an okay job and the
actual padded seat and back sections of
the chair were protected by a very thin
layer of bubble wrap not the most well
protected shipment ever but it did show
up without any noticeable damage so that
was good the chair actually did take
quite a while to build in comparison to
the max anomic in dxracer chairs and
this was directly caused by poor
manufacturing tolerances there were many
times where be trying to screw in a bolt
but the hole cut in the fabric was not
even remotely centered over the threaded
screw hole this resulted in me having to
cut away some of the fabric in order to
be able to continue and even after
fixing a large amount of these cuts
manually there were more issues the back
didn't fit into the base of the chair
that well at all and required me to
crank the support arms quite hard in
order to get them around the backing and
not something you really want to see in
a brand new product I might just be
nitpicking now due to the being
frustrated by the previous manufacturing
tolerance issues but the plastic covers
on the arms on each side of the chair
seemed subpar to me as well on the left
hand side while looking at the chair
from the front there's a tall plastic
piece this piece is only secured by one
screw and moves very easily if it gets
caught on something not really a big
deal but it just feels cheap and if I
were to move this chair to the new
office say I would legitimately worry
about it snapping off in transit if it
happened to get caught on something
lastly you just need to slip the head
pillow over the top and thread the clips
of your height adjustable lumbar support
cushion around the outside I personally
don't care much for lumbar support
cushions as they don't seem to be the
right size and I prefer the car seat
implementation where their use are
adjustable normally I don't like head
cushions either especially because I
wear headphones and with multiple
monitors when you look around they can
kind of scratch into each other and it
it presses against the cushion and
doesn't make it feel very good or you
and here the scratching which ghosts
into the cans and makes a fairly loud
noise it's just not a great experience
but that being said out of the three
chairs we have I prefer the head cushion
of the treta XL as I personally like the
material and my head doesn't feel like
it's going to slip off to the sidewith
like it does with the other ones which
is good because I also feel like the
treta XL needs the head cushion due to
the very noticeable and not padded
enough framing which runs around the
outside of the chair some people may be
able to fit in this chair without their
head resting against the framing but I
can't unfortunately for me that is not
where the issues with the frames stop
unlike the seat in my car which lightly
curves around and comfortably holds me
from the back the treta XL has large
cutout to accurately defined by Tarun as
wings the jet outs make it feel like
you're being restricted almost like
you're in a cup or a bowl the wings need
your legs force you into a very straight
forward position I often like to change
positions while I'm sitting as I'll
likely be doing so for quite some time
and one of my favorite mainly consists
of folding one leg under the other and
having my knee kind of sit out to the
side not really a possible thing in this
chair the wings on the back of the chair
are no more comfortable I have very wide
shoulders and these wings have the
unfortunate property of curving my back
and pulling my shoulders forward this
feels very awkward and resulted in my
natural position being leaning forward
as leaning back was just not worth it a
surprising result coming from a cheap
crappy IKEA chair which I can lean back
in just fine the fabric upholstery
material was actually a big plus however
if you're not looking for leather both
the Maxima can dxracer chairs come with
leather materials so having the arroz e
treta XL have a different more
breathable option is actually kind of
cool the benefit of which is that if
you're like me where I'm basically a
humanoid space heater it won't actually
kind of heat up as much which is quite
refreshing
unfortunately the this type of fabric
does have a downside if you happen to be
a sloppy eater or just plain not that
great with managing potentially spraying
liquids this fabric will absorb that
liquid and it will stain just a heads up
the various adjustments seemed fine
enough and it doesn't go up or down all
that far but I
anyone would really need more in either
direction much like other versions we've
seen this chair has the potential to go
way too far back I've been informed that
some of you want this functionality I
don't get it but it has it and it's by
no means a bad thing so there you go the
cushion is quite dense and lends itself
like the rest of the chair to a very
fixed position if your shoulder span can
fit within the wings this combination
will likely help to keep you in good
posture and the density of this foam is
more similar to max Nam ik than dxracer
I personally prefer max na mix overall
implementation but that may be bias due
to being able to comfortably fit in the
chair as a whole which leads us to the
conclusion this chair isn't directly
comparable to the previous two as it is
specifically designed as a larger chair
for larger people my main gripe of this
chair is that I prefer the two chairs
that were designed for smaller people
because I fit better not because I'm
small but because I'm too big for the
chair that was designed for big people
and the other smaller chairs offer quite
a bit more leeway in the size of their
users with less aggressively curved
wings on the side I feel like I would
have preferred one of a Rosie's other
chairs from their monza or Enzo series
as they seem to have less aggressive
wings and don't have the issues of these
giant bar like wings on the side which
hold you like a bowl and are just
generally really uncomfortable alright
let me know what you guys think over on
the forum do you want a chair that kind
of holds you like a bowl was I too hard
on it for that which chair out of the
three that we've reviewed do you prefer
again let me know on the forum while you
guys are on the forum become a
contributor to help us out and a whole
bunch of different ways you have cool
new things coming for contributors
fairly soon I've been saying that for a
while but I will fix the issues I swear
also change your Amazon link if you
don't know how you can check the support
land-speed your group button in the top
right hand corner you change your Amazon
link to help us out that'll give us
kickbacks interview buy things I don't
think you can buy this chair on Amazon
but anyways when you buy other things
back over on YouTube hit the like and
dislike buttons if you feel like summer
is fun or if you like any other season
that isn't summer because you should hit
those anyways also subscribe to see more
cool stuff like scrapyard Wars
cuz that's everything anyone wants these
days anyways thanks a lot for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
