Ubiquiti Networks bonded logic TRENDnet
and proto case to give this place a
complete makeover now the only thing
that remains is to do something about
the noise that's where the ultra touch
padding comes in the bad news is that
we've got some theories but no concrete
ideas when it comes to how we're gonna
cover the inside of this room with it
the good news is that because you have
to leave it out overnight to fluff up to
its full thickness it's pretty easy to
find in our office
our antlion audio mod mic 5 giveaway
continues we're giving away 3 mod mic 5s
and a high five man edition s mod mic
combo enter now at the link below ok
someone put all this stuff in a pile I
got it get it over here anyway this
insulation stuff that we're using is
really cool I was first put onto it when
Mike from Silent PC review was showing
me how he built his anechoic chamber
it's made by a company called bonded
logic and it's got a few things that set
it apart from other insulation so it's
not made of fiberglass or anything like
that it's actually made of recycled blue
jeans so it's like if you're into
sustainability then I guess that's cool
but it's also got awesome thermal
properties and some of the best acoustic
properties both in terms of like
dispersing sound and actually blocking
its transmission they actually make a
ton of stuff out of this recycled
blue-jean materials when I was talking
to them on the phone they actually
mentioned to me that one of the biggest
uses for this stuff now is actually
shipping perishables like food so blue
apron sponsor of ours actually uses
bonded logics shipping material to ship
you know like cold stuff that sits on
your doorstep so that it doesn't get hot
and spoil on the Sun pretty cool right
check this out check this out if you
didn't believe it's made of recycled
jeans there's a piece of zipper that's
awesome ok so right now what we're doing
is we're getting a baseline measurement
of what the sound is like through this
wall of the server room so everybody
quiet it's about forty to forty three
decibels pretty sure that says LS right
we've got a couple of different tools
to help us cut we do have a hand
insulation saw but from what I've read
online one of the best ways to cut it is
actually with a bandsaw so we had tried
to come up with a brilliant plan for
using like some kind of a mesh or like a
netting to keep it up but we actually
ended up settling on good old-fashioned
nails hold on I gotta get a hammer um so
we'll start in the corner behind the UPS
over there I'm also gonna need a lot
more nails than this dyeing it Bobby
okay I'm clearly gonna be better off pre
measuring this look I'm new at this okay
actually you know what for this one I
should just go right up the wall if this
doesn't work we don't really have
another plan at the moment
this is looking like it might work huh
how about that okay so just a few more
hours of this and then I'm good okay
this is a thick one Wow I'm gonna go
through a ton of nails how many are in
here I don't feel like this is enough
oh damn it was that the label maker
we'll deal with it later
oh that's the steel good for security
bad for putting nails in - good thing we
dusted the server's right we are ready
to get our after eating okay everybody
quiet and we have discovered a fatal
flaw in our testing methodology because
the room is way quieter but we would
have had to take our measurement from
quite a bit closer to isolate the noise
that comes from the room from the noise
that comes from the computers that are
here and the transformer over there so I
give up whatever mission accomplished
but boy is there ever still a lot of
work to do so what I discovered very
quickly when working with the ultra
touch insulation is that it still sheds
a fair bit of material creating dust for
my freshly dusted servers look at this
keyboard look at this keyboard
fortunately I was one step ahead and I
ordered a like a custom air filter but
we need a longer term solution so that's
where this special black stage cloth
comes in if we can cover up all of the
insulation in here we'll be able to keep
this place from being a dust mine let's
get crack-a-lackin' holy crap this is
heavy and expensive this role was like
hundreds of dollars this stuff is
acoustically neutral I believe is the
term for it and it lets sound pass
through so it can be absorbed by the
ultra touch if we were to put plastic
over it we would actually get
substantially more reflections my tape
measure go this is the problem with any
DIY project so I've actually done a lot
of the easy stuff along this left wall
here it only takes a couple of nails and
staples actually to hold it in place but
now it's gonna get a lot more
challenging so check this out standing
right behind the servers you can hear
how loud they are and standing right
here it's not much quieter cool huh oh
nice I think this is gonna make it all
the way into this corner perfect okay I
mean my stapler
another handy dandy thing about this
fabric is once you start ripping it it
rips in a straight line in both
directions as far as I can tell I need
certs me too this stuff yeah so
everyone's back in the office now though
it is a couple days later so I can't
afford to accidentally unplug anything
anymore
oh no I press the button escape yeah I
didn't put Duva teen behind the server
cabinet itself just cuz I figured if I'm
running cables back there or anything
like that I didn't want to have
something that is more grip ease
not bad okay finally almost there we've
got all the insulation contained and
finally the last piece from proto case
arrived so this is my custom vent for
the door of the server room
now noise isolation relies on sealing up
a room as much as you can follow up in
this later
come here and as you can see I've got
this just covered but in the event that
our air conditioning fails we've
actually got a thermostat here that's
gonna monitor the temperature of the
room and kick on an auxiliary fan up
there so at least it doesn't completely
bake in here
so jake designed and proto case created
for us a custom shroud that we're gonna
cover this hole with so that the sound
doesn't have a direct path out but the
air still has a way in ow elbow it's
metal what do they expect to happen to
it in shipping no I'm not angry they
packed it well oh my knee
oh my heat sinks would any of you
watching this believe I'm not much of a
handyman you guys try cutting through
five inch thick blue jeans it's hard
okay just going at it upside down oh
damn it
oh no where did all these screws go I
don't have time for this
there it is all right come on in Brendan
I think this hole is not optimal I think
we may have to cut back a bit more also
I have to remove some of my nails did he
just hammer nails into a door yes
yes I did and now I'm removing them with
my bare hands
oh damn I was hoping to hook that up
there yeah okay screw it I'm going in
you're just gonna drill right through
the metal ah cut myself alone and
drilled it okay here we go
hit me now I installed them backwards ah
actually a very simple kind of elegant
design good work Jake so we still have
to do this
then the do the teen then the grand
finale here we go acid test time uh-huh
nice wow it's actually almost level two
look at that awesome so there's
ventilation and here is noise blocking
Oh homestretch now we just got to secure
the insulation to the door and cover oh
we're so close so 42 by about 90 so I
want it look you secure this really well
people are probably wondering why I'm
using nails for this the answer is
pretty simple they're easy to remove
sure it's wrong sure the internet is
gonna tell me about why it's wrong and
then I'll know so it's good that's how
we learn by doing things wrong and then
being corrected on the Internet
I'm gonna cut it sort of approximately
but smaller and then just kind of fold
it over I will give you this Brendan
this really is very cool fabric oh
they're so theoretically
I don't need this anymore it's all
covered you know what I think the air
filter on this thing is overkill anyway
I'm not gonna bother hey yeah okay so
we're done then right the room is quiet
the room is clean the cables are managed
and AH fresh from its adventure in
learning to be water cooled this export
server is sliding back into the rack
there's nothing left to do right
oh-ho you underestimate me my friends
RGB lighting oh this is RGB W chainable
up to three meters okay first I need to
know if these are the magnetic kids oh
yeah baby they are okay that's excellent
we've got a couple standalone power
supplies cuz we don't actually want
these to run off of the computers that
are in here because the RGB always needs
to work I cannot wait
Oh gonna be sick sick I tell you it
gives some thought cable management here
given that was the whole point of this
bloody project okay so we're just gonna
go straight until the wall realistically
these do not need to run off the UPS Wow
it's amazing that's what I'm talking
about
alright let's see if I can hit both of
these at once oh yes
ting makes it easy to spend less on your
monthly mobile bill basically you head
over to their website so that's Linus
ENCOM we've got that linked in the video
description and check out their savings
calculator you put in your last few
months of bills you put in how much you
paid and it lets you know if Tings pay
for only what you use system is going to
work for you and the odds are pretty
good because the average ting bill is
only 23 bucks a month per device so you
must be sitting there going Linus well
this sounds like it kind of shoddy
mobile carrier where their customer
service probably sucks but that's not
the case if you call up ting you can try
it you will speak to a real live human
being
no phone tree no automated menu nothing
like that and data is now just 10 bucks
a gig beyond the first gigabyte even
better than that
if you use our link to sign up you can
get $25 towards a new device or your
first bill so check it out so thank you
for tolerating all three parts of server
room upgrade blog I hope you guys
enjoyed it as much as I did if you
dislike these videos hit that dislike
button but if you liked them hit the
like button get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description huge shout out to
bonded logic cable mod TRENDnet
cableorganizer.com
those guys were instrumental in helping
us figure out how to do the cable
management stuff and supplying us with
all that gear that we needed and I
served since
really hope I'm not forgetting anybody
but I have a feeling that I am alright
thank you guys for watching subscribe
and merch store and all that stuff I am
freaking exhausted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
