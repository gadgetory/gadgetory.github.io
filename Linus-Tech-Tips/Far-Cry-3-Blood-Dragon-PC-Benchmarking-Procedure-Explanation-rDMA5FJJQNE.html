Corsair obsidian 350d micro ATX case
exceptional expansion and cooling
flexibility for compact high performance
PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more so you want to know how to
benchmark far cry 3 just like slick stay
tuned he is going to show you
step-by-step how to complete our run of
Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon which is a
specific type of Far Cry 3 that is
different from the other kinds of Far
Cry 3 especially the tracking thing so
basically you blow this guy away and
then he'll tell you the rest because I
am completely unsuitable for these sorts
of videos because I'm not good at
headshotting and apparently all of our
runs now involve headshotting so I think
that's his way of making sure his job is
very secure because if he just makes it
so that I actually can't do any of the
runs then yeah I I can never fire him
for real so slick got fired so I guess
it looks like I'll have to do the
gameplay video of myself actually I lied
he's he's just sick so anyway you get
into this little base thing you got a
headshot the dude's make sure your
headshot all the dudes let's see this
this lick this is why I can't do these
anymore because you just make it sort of
unfair ok that one's not a headshot but
it's like a high chest shot now guys
this is really important you got to spin
up the minigun before you come around
this corner because these big dudes will
do a number on
if you don't make sure that you clear
them reasonably quickly okay so here we
go gonna keep going to put you into the
mini gun the mini gun is important to
monitor your ammunition so slick tries
to expel 700 rounds of ammunition wow
this is getting dirty really quickly
every time he does the run through
because that way there's some
consistency to the amount of particle
effect nonsense that goes on so guys
that start spawning and coming in from
behind you again make sure you take out
the big guys because they will cause
real problems for you they really if you
die because this is an 80s themed game
there's no regenerating health so you
actually have to make sure that you
don't legitimately die because we're
trying not to do things inconsistently
like a plan that get one time and then
not do it another time so here we go
back into the main room there were some
complaints that the BioShock Infinite
benchmark run-through didn't have enough
action so hopefully that has all been
addressed this time around because
pretty much the entire thing is fighting
and blasting stuff here we go so this is
the you know keeping the particle
effects up at the end of the benchmark
okay so now you switch back to the
shotgun go ahead and hit this thing
twice prototype is destroyed jump over
here and by the time you get to the
stairs you'll be you'll blue hope you
can be pretty much at the end of the
benchmark thanks for tuning in and it's
back to me from me now
oh cool
he did like an automatic yeah if you
learn on top of them he'll kill them I
got mad skills so that I don't even have
to know what I'm supposed to do
gingka anyway so this is why actually we
we lied before slick is not fired and
what you're witnessing right now is why
we don't have me do our video game
benchmark runs anymore because I clearly
have no idea what I'm doing
