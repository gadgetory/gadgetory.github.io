peripherals has the features you need to
win at a price you like click now to
learn more now I get criticized a fair
bid for not really criticizing products
enough I think some people feel and for
not looking at lower end products that
are more affordable out of the time we
tend to get really focused on the high
end sexy stuff so to address both of
those things I'm gonna be taking a look
at the r7 240 a product that sucks and
is cheap so we're gonna go ahead and
take this out of the box to be clear I'm
not particularly criticizing msi here
there's nothing different about their r7
240 implementation that makes it worse
than anyone elses it's just that this
graphics card for $80 makes absolutely
no sense and nobody should buy it so
let's go ahead and have a look at the
card itself it has a downward draft
cooler which should I guess is what it
is it's got a heatsink that's like
indicative of how much power you can
expect this thing to have and then it's
also bought a full-size bracket or you
can replace that with two half sized
brackets so that you can install it in a
low profile case although you won't be
having a very satisfactory gaming
experience with it anyway it comes with
a driver disk and that is pretty much
all so I'd like to take a moment to talk
about the concept of price to
performance yes this is an $80 card but
even if it was a $60 card on special
promo it still makes absolutely no sense
to buy because there are options that
cost just a little bit more that deliver
so much better performance you see guys
there is a sweet spot buying a $500
computer or a $400 computer is not a
sweet spot experience you are actually
getting less for your money by buying
something that is less expensive
similarly when you start to spend a
fortune on GTX Titans or 780 s or you
know r9 290 X's you are similarly
getting less for your money that is why
graphics cards like these exist these
are the Radeon 77 70 and the r7 260x so
this is the last gen product so it will
tend to be a very good deal and the 260x
is a current gen product so it carries a
bit of a price premium right now but you
can still see that it is a much better
value than this
so low-end products i guess i'm without
further ado let's get into the
benchmarks so here's dirt3 we're running
at 1080p so any reasonable gaming
experience is going to be at 1080p these
days
we're running 4x on msaa so that's
anti-aliasing and we're running on high
or ultra so both of these graphics card
this one for about $100 and this one for
about a hundred and forty dollars run
this game very satisfactorily you're
having a great gaming experience on our
standard test bench this one in spite of
having the benefit of using one of the
best CPUs available that is overclocked
can manage a meagre 18 FPS you will have
an even worse experience on your
computer this game is not playable at
high details at 1080p Far Cry 3 this is
more of a hardcore title so we weren't
really expecting this to do very well
but guys the performance difference here
considering the price this gets 28
frames per second this gets 9 frames per
second 9 frames per second it is one
third the performance and it costs more
than half as much that isn't reasonable
that doesn't make any sense the sweet
spot for this one it's probably gonna be
more like the 77 70 which costs just
about 25% more than an r7 240 and
performs more than double E as well
delivering a very playable experience
particularly once you turn on ta liasing
off even running that game at pretty
high settings next up we've got Tomb
Raider fairly mainstream title
third-person adventure game all that
kind of noise so both of these games at
Ultra without tress-fx did I say games
because I meant graphics cards deliver a
playable experience here averaging 42 51
FPS this okay again cost about 25% less
than a 77 70 and manages a meager just
over one third of the performance this
you guys is why I don't focus on low-end
stuff and this is why I don't generally
make videos about stuff that I think you
stupid because it just makes for a video
where I haven't actually told you
anything useful about what to what to
buy I guess I have
don't buy low-end junk because it
doesn't make sense
you're better off saving your pennies
for like another couple weeks
another couple allowances and getting
something that delivers a much much
better value that is all my
thank you for checking out this unboxing
and cautionary tale about the r7 240 I
apologize to AMD and MSI for anything
that I said that might offend them about
this video but let's face it guys
low-end cards are stupid and they make
no sense and so there you go you should
just get something a little bit better
and pay a little bit more actually a lot
better so deal with it don't forget to
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment if
you have any thoughts to share with me
about maybe you think that these make
sense I mean they have HDMI so they can
carry audio you know what most onboard
graphics that supports all that stuff to
these days and as always don't forget to
