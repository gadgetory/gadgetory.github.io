highest end TVs that Samsung makes this
thing is 65 inches 4k it's got a quantum
dot display it's HDR it's got big speed
voice basically all the bells and
whistles oh and it's beautiful but
that's not actually what we care about
today almost exactly a year ago we made
a video investigating the gaming
experience on LG's Nano cell TV with a
focus on input lag but there's a lot
more to a gaming display than just low
input lag which brings us to this this
is the first TV to reach our lab with
variable refresh rate support right out
of the box you guys heard me this puppy
right here has free sync
so naturally we wasted no time at all
hooking it up to yeah got you guys
there's nothing in there I did say we
wasted no time at all so it's already
hooked up to an Xbox one X and a Vega
equipped PC so we could test it let's
dive right in shall we
after we all dive into my pants where I
can show you my Mac Wheldon underwear
yes my friends Mac Wheldon underwear is
so comfortable that if you don't like it
you can get a full refund with their
Tryon guarantee use offer code tectus at
the link below to get 20% off
so some of you are probably wondering
first of all do I really have to spend
over $3,000 on a fancy q9f if I want
freesync and second how did Samsung
manage to deliver a variable refresh
rate display to my living room before
the Nvidia big format gaming displays
that we saw at CES 10 months ago the
answer to both of them has to do with
how free sync is implemented so even
though the announcement only came in
late March of this year Samsung was able
to push free sync support to almost
their entire 2018 lineup including the
$700 49 inch and you eight thousand
because unlike Nvidia g-sync free sync
does not require a proprietary not to
mention pricy Hardware module to be
included in the display instead free
sync relies on hardware that is already
baked into industry standard basis Pesa
fication x' like DisplayPort and in this
case HDMI now to be clear hdmi 2.0 ports
like the ones found on the back of the
q9 F's external one connect box weren't
originally designed to include variable
refresh rate the way that DisplayPort
1.2 and HDMI 2.1 ports were but hdmi 2.0
does allow vendor specific extensions
which is exactly how Microsoft added
free sync to their Xbox 1s and Xbox one
X back in April this year giving AMD and
Samsung a built-in audience of millions
of gamers and therefore a strong
incentive to tack free sync onto these
TVs improving the gaming experience now
the main benefit of free sync and other
variable refresh rate technologies is
that it synchronizes the framerate of
your game with the refresh rate of your
display to combat stuttering or hitching
during animations and tearing a visual
anomaly where the top and the bottom of
the frame aren't aligned in the real
world we found that the main benefit is
that it makes frame rate dips that occur
during intense scenes less noticeable
that is as long as the dips aren't too
low bringing us to this important point
just because a TV has free sink doesn't
mean that it's just like a make
everything good button or that it's even
a good implementation of it and the main
factor here is something called the
variable refresh rate range so any
display has a limit to how fast it can
go
but this variable refresh rate range
also specifies a limit to how slow it
can refresh so like if you buy a 60
Hertz monitor and you play csgo on a
high-end PC that can push out 200 frames
per second turning on free sync isn't
going to magically make your monitor
refresh at 200 Hertz your eye is still
gonna see 60 frames every second then on
the other end of the spectrum if your
game renders below the lower limit of
your free synced display the display
will be forced to repeat some of the
frames that has received and this
introduces stuttering so back to our TV
now then Samsung's free sync
implementation has three different
ranges to keep in the back of your mind
if your PC gaming at 1080p you got two
options basic with a range of 90 to 120
fps and ultimate with a range of 48 to
120 fps and it should be noted that I'm
using fps and Hertz sort of
interchangeably here because that's kind
of the point as for if you're plugged
into an Xbox one S or 1x basic won't
even be an option as for why anyone
would even want to use basic well
supposedly it can help resolve
flickering issues that LCDs can
sometimes run into at high frame rates
as for 4k gaming well there you're going
to be left with a much narrower range
it's pretty common for 4k monitors to
offer a 40 to 60 FPS range but here on
this TV
you only get 48 to 60 making the sweet
spot just 12 frames wide before you'll
start to get stutters when the action
gets intense
in fairness this thing is mostly
targeting console gamers which at the
moment basically means it's for the Xbox
one X and for the most part game
developers work hard to optimize their
games for a smooth experience anyway and
in some cases they actually do such a
good job that in halo 5 Guardians for
example we didn't see any stuttering or
tearing with or without free sync on
with that said severe framerate drops
definitely do happen especially when
there's a lot going on at once and this
implementation of free sync isn't going
to help you with all of them because
even though the Xbox 1s and One X
support free sync - which includes low
framerate compensation this TV only
supports a modified free sync 1 so it's
got HDR which is kind of a free sync to
feature but it doesn't have LFC so then
while having free sync on removed to the
frequent tearing during Call of Duty
World War 2 zine engine cutscenes it
didn't do much to combat the hitching
that happens when you move into new
areas of the map or when Forza 7s trying
to load up your car and character model
before a race so then should you get a
free synced TV like this one today from
just an overall experience standpoint
yeah yeah maybe I mean it's not like
you're paying extra for it and it looks
great in the input lag is even less than
the ones we tested last time around but
if you are specifically after a robust
variable refresh rate experienced well
then it gets a little bit tougher
because there is a lot coming in the
next year or two that is going to change
the landscape here so desync TVs from
the likes of HP a sous and acer are
gonna be coming out in the we hope next
few months here and I mean this year we
might even see TVs from Samsung that are
equipped with HDMI 2.1 which would mean
among other things 4k at 120 Hertz and
the real full fat official variable
refresh rate implementation so if you
desperately need a TV today
is certainly better than not having it
but as it always is with high technology
well you could get it even better if you
wait speaking of waiting don't wait
