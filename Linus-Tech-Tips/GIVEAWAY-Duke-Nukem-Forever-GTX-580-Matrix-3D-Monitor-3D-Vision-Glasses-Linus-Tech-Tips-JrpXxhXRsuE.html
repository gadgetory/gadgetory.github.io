latest Duke Nukem game Duke Nukem
Forever we've been seeing screenshots
for years but it's finally here and this
video exists for a couple of reasons
number one is to let me wear this sweet
outfit that obviously looks great and is
very styling and there's actually people
in the parking lot here that are seeing
me like this go ahead pan around to the
people see you got a guy in his umbrella
over there is another guy over there so
yeah yeah not only will I be
broadcasting myself all over YouTube
like this but I'm actually here in the
flesh and it's kind of embarrassing so
which brings me to why I've done this
you guys all left comments on my videos
pretty much all of you I think about the
color of my hair while there was a very
good reason I did promise to reveal it
we are going to be running another video
contest so this video contest is going
to be along the same lines as the last
one number one your video may be no
longer than 30 seconds number two you
should submit it as a video response to
this video for your chance to win number
three this contest is open to people
world wide last time I put in an
annotation saying world wide is okay
world wide but I asked that if you're
outside of the continental US and Canada
that you would pay the shipping for the
prize so why don't we talk about the
prize first let's do the prize and then
we'll say what your video has to be so I
have three things generously donated by
a Susan NVIDIA to give away to the
winner of our Duke video contest one is
Anna soos GeForce GTX 580 matrix
platinum graphics card this is a 1.5 gig
custom PCB GeForce GTX 580 with a custom
cooler with big ol fat heat pipes it's
got all kinds of cool stuff going on on
it so there you go I haven't done an
unboxing about this so I actually know
nothing about it I just know that it's
good it's expensive
and you want one we also have an Nvidia
3d vision wireless glasses kit including
a full copy of Duke Nukem Forever now
you'll have a 3d vision ready graphics
card 3d vision glasses but without a 3d
ready monitor that's not gonna do you a
lot of good so here we have it the S
soos VG 236 twenty three point six inch
3d ready LCD monitor so you win all
three of these prizes if you win the
video contest so let's go back over to
my plants backdrop here and I will tell
you guys what you have to do so 30
seconds or less I want some kind of Duke
Nukem themed video you guys can dress up
in a costume you can do you know
voiceovers a video game footage capture
whatever you want to do it's totally up
to you so it's gonna be scored based on
the creativity the amount of work that
goes into it and I'm also throwing in
another stipulation this time I'm gonna
give you guys bonus marks for throwing
in anything about Nvidia 3d vision or my
workplace NCIX comm so feel free to
throw those in although you get more
points for subtlety if your video is
just you standing in front of a webcam
saying one seok's is great Duke Nukem is
cool then you're not gonna win so I
think that's pretty much it
good luck you guys don't forget 30
seconds respond to this video you've got
one month so I'm actually setting a
deadline this time you got one month
we're gonna judge it the same way as
last time cameraman crazy Russian the
NCIX artist who designed the intro
screen for my new videos and myself we
are all going to judge which videos we
think are the best based on their
individual merits once again creativity
is key Duke Nukem themed and video 3d
vision and NCIX are all for bonus points
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
