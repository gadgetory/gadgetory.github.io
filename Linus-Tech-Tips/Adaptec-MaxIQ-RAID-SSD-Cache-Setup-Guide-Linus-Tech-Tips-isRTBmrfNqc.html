this is the Adaptec SSD cache so it's
their max IQ product basically it goes
with any supported Adaptec raid cart so
in this case I have a 54 45 from Adaptec
how many times I said Adaptec already in
this video I've set up the SSD as one of
the four drives that's connected to this
controller so you can see I've got three
other drives those are all Hitachi 1
terabyte 7200 rpm drives they are
configured in raid 5 and I just wanted
to do a quick video showing how to set
up the max IQ cache once you've got it
connected to the controller so the first
thing you might need to do is update the
firmware on your card which I did have
to do you installed the latest Adaptec
storage manager software and then all
you have to do is go into direct attack
storage K PC in this case controller 1
and then you can see here that on
connector 0 we have an SSD and three
SATA hard drives so it already knows
that there's an SSD connected we have
one logical device so that is the
Hitachi raid 5 you can tell from the
little v indicated here and you can see
some more information about this here in
this screen so we've got status power
segments device yeah everything that we
need to know and then up here this
little button right here says cache and
it has a little picture of an SSD so we
click on that it brings up a menu where
all we have to do is go to device 0
click SSD and then click apply Oh hold
on fetch right well we'll leave that at
default for now so we click apply and
now it has configured this 32 gig
Adaptec SSD in this case it's an X 25 e
from Intel as a cache for my raid 5
configuration now some Adaptec cards
actually support using third-party SSDs
such as some of aussies enterprise level
drives but this particular card only
supports the max IQ kit so that was it
now we're gonna later on today hopefully
maybe tomorrow do some benchmarks
comparing before and after
- and don't forget to check out the
video that I've done on the topic of
using SSD caches because it's very very
interesting I actually compared quite a
few different solutions in the market
but this was not one of them so I'm
really looking forward to seeing the
performance numbers that we can generate
by adding even it's just a small 32 gig
cache to this particular array</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
