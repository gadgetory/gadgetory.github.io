yeah you're coming over here right guys
like okay you should have heard him
before before the camera started rolling
I was like hey do you like our review of
a copy Lake process you're like no I'm
like okay well then fine so here's how
it's gonna work
your system getting dropped that's right
so this is James and we're gonna be
upgrading his craptastic rig today
the asus rog Strix 1080 TI is 5k gaming
and VR ready
featuring to hdmi 2.0 to DisplayPort 1.4
and one DVI port allowing you to connect
a VR headset and up to four monitors
check it out at the link below
alright James so tell me about your
system here what was your theme
other than Asus because ROG sponsored
this ohm I was hoping to have it like
white and blue because those are pretty
fun colors okay well we got the white
right black black black black black and
gray white Hey
all right black
hey hey waiting blue kala mod got it
right fantastic have you ever built a
system before I've not you've never
built a system before no wow it's not
really a surprise none of the other ones
yet so first things first have you ever
watched like a system build guide before
I have maybe not all the way through but
a little bit not all the way through no
you know can you imagine imagine for a
moment okay if you took this approach to
everything in your life okay like let's
say you know you go for your you know
Marine training and you go all the way
through and then you get to the point
where like you know you have to reload
the gun and you didn't make it to that
part now what I said wouldn't go so well
do you know what the first step is you
unpack stuff yes start with this one
step one open the box like that yeah
yeah it's like that's fine yeah actually
no it isn't like that oh oh my man yeah
okay
so CPU installation easy lift out and
then up this arm right here now look at
it closely okay okay now the most
important thing here is that it goes
down with no force whatsoever okay so if
you've been doing any Jedi training
don't use it
alright ah oh my goodness this thing
just broke off what are you gonna do now
I believe that's supposed to come off
okay so you have watched it'll go
- okay ran is the hardest part okay so
this one has got to go in here I'm
pretty sure if I go over here yeah all
right there we go
hey so uh Colton what do you think are
the odds this cable mod can't works with
this power supply this time oh no you
know this is not a modular power supply
right hold on there's another one that
is - was definitely interesting um he
definitely knew a lot and I was kind of
fun but he has such an interesting
personality you think he kind of puts on
this persona for being on the YouTube
videos and he kind of does but he's also
that energetic and craziness most of the
time go ahead and open that up
hey are you old enough to use a knife oh
no
okay you got a pretty dank set up now
but have you like ever gamed on a
high-end machine I don't think so have
you ever experienced the high refresh
rate like higher than sixty Hertz on a
monitor I don't think so
no yeah you'd know if you had cuz it's
amazing all right one of my friends has
a 1080 okay but he doesn't let you use
it no you won't you want to give him a
shout-out here for being like super nice
and for sharing his stuff
yeah crystal real awesome do you oh okay
so you put those screws through the
washers now I'm not giving you the
washers go find your own washers these
are mine are there other washers no
they're not okay so next thing we need
is the blue and white case that's mostly
black it can be blue in your imagination
you have a strong imagination oh thanks
oh okay is it blue oh yeah okay so just
shove it back towards the i/o and there
you go just like that nice how you
feeling
pretty good pretty good feeling like
you've achieved something today oh yeah
well you would because you're the guy
who watched as part of a builds guide so
this is legitimately I think I've said
this a couple times but this is actually
usually the hardest part of the build
for new builders if you get all these
little things and it looks like you're
supposed to plug them into the board not
at all
all you do is you bundle them all up you
Jam them into the blades of one of the
fans just leave it like that
see these holes yeah see that I'm just
gonna pop that in there and you flex
this out you line up the other side with
the holes oh I broke it okay go for it
and if it clicks it goes too far oh no
I'm just kidding the click is good so
we've gotta put this on here so you just
got to go grab those nuts okay you came
back one nut short man you dropped your
nut on the ground
leave my your dad's saying you're going
to let them watch these videos anymore
why don't we get to the most exciting
part putting this fan filter back on
backwards and then the right way
No why don't you open up your graphics
card this thing is I would say pretty
much top-of-the-line except that it is
GTX 10 ATT I support 4G sync your
monitor as do you think right oh you got
the 240 Hertz monitor nice because you
have g-sync you're actually only gonna
see exactly the right number of frames
without any tearing or stutter or
anything like that
look at this documentation it's got gold
lettering there it is is it heavier than
you expected actually it's a little bit
lighter really see I take all this stuff
for granted so it's kind of fun for me
to see like people having their first
experience with like this grade of
hardware the graphics card is kind of I
feel like the main piece and a lot of um
gaming PC builds and tabs such a
top-of-the-line one as the Strix 1080
who is pretty fun you want to put it in
right oh yeah okay
and then the yeah you got to move up a
little bit though I mean no pressure
it's only like a $700 graphics pretty
nice that's it that's the performance
piece I mean the 7700 K processor the 16
gigs of ram the 480 gig you know PCIe
SSD how that's like performance - ok you
ready sure hit it oh that's not a good
sign now I'm just kidding Python go for
it it's alive alright are you just using
sweet to humor me you're using dated
slang just to make me feel more at ease
no no I'm genuinely excited so this is
cool this is the actual refresh rate
that your monitor is refreshing at so
that's why no matter what frame rate
your graphics card is pushing out you
won't see any tearing or any stuttering
that's GC
all right and may I just say on my old
computer at ultra-low settings it took
like 10 seconds just a load of the map
say it's uh I don't know I get so jaded
because I tool around with the stuff all
the time but I forget that there are
people out there that are actually like
waiting you know 30 seconds to get into
a game nice you're sitting up like 170
180 FPS bad you're actually really
taking advantage then of the extra
refresh rate of this monitor yeah like
that is a lot of updates per second and
I can actually like see foliage on the
ground yes all my life I had waited to
see foliage on the ground in this games
they're frustrated I think really made a
big difference actually being able to
look at people and target them whereas
before it was just kind of a mess whoa I
I'm actually getting kills for oh that's
sad let's show you how to overclock your
graphics card let's put your your next
to the system here that very quiet right
yep okay let's kick it up a notch that's
the sound of performance so if you want
the best possible temperatures while
you're overclocking you can just go ham
on the fan speed or you can actually use
the user-defined here in order to set up
your own fan curve then as far as
GeForce overclocking goes these days
it's pretty straightforward you drag the
power target all the way to the end then
you start creeping up your GPU boost
o'clock GPU voltage makes less of a
difference these days than it used to
but you can try tweaking it a little bit
of all the things that can actually kill
your hardware when you're overclocking
increasing the voltage is pretty much it
looking the computer was fun and getting
to meet all the people from honest media
group was really amazing
it was really interesting seeing how
everything fits together and it was also
a lot more simple than I thought it
would be just pretty much just plugging
things together honestly I think : is on
my favorite people Alliance meet again
oh I think that pretty much wraps it up
for this episode of ROG rig reboot James
you've been a pleasure to build this
system with I hope you get many many
hours of fun out of it doing schoolwork
yep
so thanks guys for watching and thanks
to asus rog for allowing us to hook them
up with this unbelievable upgrade</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
