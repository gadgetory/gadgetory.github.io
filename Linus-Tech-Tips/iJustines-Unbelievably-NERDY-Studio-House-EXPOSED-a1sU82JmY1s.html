this just garbage or is this like a
decoration it's for videos it's for
videos except that it's you just throw
garbage in it that's for cupcakes no you
know what I don't buy it
so I have to confess I cheated a little
bit because I've been here shooting a
video all day but I asked for some tools
and as far as I can tell
Justine doesn't own any tools that
aren't pink I mean why would i if you
were ever wondering what happens when a
washed-up youtuber does a book or
audiobook
well they sent me all of those and I'm
like you can use CDs what is it any
wonder he thought you were creepy no
it's not I deserved the restraining
order her to be honest with you does
YouTube know about this do you think
they would even want to send you a play
button if they knew it was gonna sit in
the garage well I thought I would put it
next to a picture of myself why not
completely normal oh that's a sad story
that fill in the 187's oh it's dead yeah
water damage Oh Dropcam I'm not sure put
it down okay so in here we've got some
pretty normal stuff like oh I don't know
a 150 terabyte storage server with a
custom nameplate that we set up today so
that's pretty cool
we had Ethernet wiring for it here along
with Ethernet wiring for it here
recessed power Wow now it is one thing
to organize this not feel like overkill
label thing
professional organizer they organized
for me you know what I'm wearing this
for the rest of the video oh my god
there's more BMO's oh yeah I haven't
opened those ones yet this this is where
you keep a gaming PC of this caliber oh
it has such a beautiful paint job it's
actually incredible who is this from
it's for origin look at this beer oh my
god I missed this thing so much this is
my first gaming PC oh wow this is like
GTX 580 I think ax 1200 I power supply
this is like the bee's knees from a few
years back they even do the custom name
thing on the back for you and this is
how you repeat you know what I'm calling
the guys at origin I'm getting you in
trouble this is just labeled drone and
it's empty so you're professional
organizers didn't do a great job this
thing is cool like fur coats yeah get
more more gift wrap what is this what is
that this gift wrap oh this is like an
obsession you're like a hoarder me to

punishment let's get this over with here
oh hi I guess I should have knocked
what the hell there's more wrapping
paper in here this is like this is
beyond weird dude okay to be fair every
time I need wrapping paper I can't find

what I this is my nighttime TV this is
your night so so far by my count yeah

do to this one I dropped it so this is
the og iPhone I forgot how thick it was
I know it's crazy right yeah like wow if
this thing was really thick like okay 11
iPhones okay you don't necessarily have
like a huge hoarding problem you just
have like a significant hoarding problem
cool bathroom bro great shower you can
sit down in the shower if you're tired
why would you need an Ethernet
coax in the bathroom what bag instead of
moving into a place again with the
intention of repurposing one of the
bathrooms as a server room well why
wouldn't you is the question I'll be
honest with you I'm a bad guy

with a stabber yeah is this another TV
okay this is my office TV and what else
do you have in here another Xbox one
lease more Xbox controllers yeah another
one wait wait look is this another Xbox
box in here so this is it this is where
I just seen videos are created see this
is the dongle world that Joni I've
envisioned these dongles this is this is
the future my friends this is this is
what Apple wanted this was actually the
reason that I came down here we had to
address this I saw a picture of this on
Twitter this is Justine system for
storing her archived data this is
terrible
literally all of this is making its way
onto that white and pink server that I
installed a little bit earlier and thank
goodness for this which brings us to the
last corner where we've got a Hello
Kitty guitar do you actually play
I used to Wow and more evidence of
Justine's amiibo problem this video was
brought to you by tunnel bear the easy
to use VPN when people are shopping for
a VPN one of the features they look for
is a
he'll switch because before you connect
to a network your device actually starts
to send information about itself and
what it wants to do and it tries to
establish connections with all sorts of
things so kill switches keep this
behavior from happening and before you
connect to your VPN after you've
connected to a network all of your
traffic is actually unencrypted so in
the few seconds it takes to connect your
VPN you've probably already broadcast
your IP maybe a few DNS requests
vigilant bear from tunnel bear stops all
this stuff from happening by blocking
outbound and inbound traffic so nothing
leaks out before you connect and if your
connection goes down for some reason
vigilant bear kicks back in and stops
all the traffic till it comes back so
try telling bear for free with no credit
card required at Tunnel Bear comm /l tt
we're gonna have that linked below guys
if you just liked this video you know
what to do but if you liked it hit the
like button get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured yeah that's part of my
