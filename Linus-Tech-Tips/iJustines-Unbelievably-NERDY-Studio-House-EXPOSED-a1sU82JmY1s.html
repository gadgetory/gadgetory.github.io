bit because I've been here shooting a
video all day but I asked for some tools
and as far as I can tell
Justine doesn't own any tools that
aren't pink I mean why would i if you
were ever wondering what happens when a
washed-up youtuber does a book or
audiobook
well they sent me all of those and I'm
like you can use CDs what is it any
wonder he thought you were creepy no
it's not I deserved the restraining
order her to be honest with you does
YouTube know about this do you think
they would even want to send you a play
button if they knew it was gonna sit in
the garage well I thought I would put it
next to a picture of myself why not
completely normal oh that's a sad story
that fill in the 187's oh it's dead yeah
water damage Oh Dropcam I'm not sure put
it down okay so in here we've got some
pretty normal stuff like oh I don't know

one wait wait look is this another Xbox
box in here so this is it this is where
I just seen videos are created see this
is the dongle world that Joni I've
envisioned these dongles this is this is
the future my friends this is this is
what Apple wanted this was actually the
reason that I came down here we had to
address this I saw a picture of this on
Twitter this is Justine system for
storing her archived data this is
terrible
literally all of this is making its way
onto that white and pink server that I
installed a little bit earlier and thank
goodness for this which brings us to the
last corner where we've got a Hello
Kitty guitar do you actually play
I used to Wow and more evidence of
Justine's amiibo problem this video was
brought to you by tunnel bear the easy
to use VPN when people are shopping for
a VPN one of the features they look for
is a
he'll switch because before you connect
to a network your device actually starts
to send information about itself and
what it wants to do and it tries to
establish connections with all sorts of
things so kill switches keep this
behavior from happening and before you
connect to your VPN after you've
connected to a network all of your
traffic is actually unencrypted so in
the few seconds it takes to connect your
VPN you've probably already broadcast
your IP maybe a few DNS requests
vigilant bear from tunnel bear stops all
this stuff from happening by blocking
outbound and inbound traffic so nothing
leaks out before you connect and if your
connection goes down for some reason
vigilant bear kicks back in and stops
all the traffic till it comes back so
try telling bear for free with no credit
card required at Tunnel Bear comm /l tt
