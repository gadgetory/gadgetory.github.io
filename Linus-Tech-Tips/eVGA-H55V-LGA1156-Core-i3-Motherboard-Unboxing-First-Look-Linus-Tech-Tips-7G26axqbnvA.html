lately but I thought why not so I'm
gonna have a look today at the EVGA H 55
V this is an H 55 other word that means
it's compatible with all core i3 Core i5
and core i7 processors on LGA 1156 so
what that means though is that not all
of the features are necessarily
compatible with the processors so if you
are running say for example a core i3
dual core processor you will be able to
run onboard video if you're running a
core i5 quad core or a core i7 on this
particular motherboard the onboard video
won't work you'll have to install an
add-in graphics card so a little bit
more on that shortly EVGA first of all
includes a huge visual guide to your new
motherboard I love these I think that
they're a really nice touch they give
you a full sized picture like actual
sized picture of the motherboard where
they label all of the important
components and they also give you some
quick instructions on how to do the
various things you might have to do so
you can see that the limo okay we're not
gonna look at the picture for too long
because obviously we have a real
motherboard here that we could look at
is good so once I get this opened up I
will definitely have a closer look at
all the different features next we find
an i/o shield very fairly run as a mill
I Oh shield next inside the box we find
two black straight SATA cables so
neither of these are right angle
something to note about the EVGA SATA
cables is one end features a lock and
the other end has no lock so the locking
end is intended to go into your
motherboard they also include a molex to
two SATA power connectors and these have
a lock on them that's something I
haven't seen before it's there's
actually a little lever there to depress
interesting yeah I've never seen that
before then we have a USB pci bracket
next we have a driver CD do not use it
download the latest drivers off the EVGA
website next we have the EVGA H 55v
motherboard installation guide so
installing the CPU the CPU fan the
system memory the i/o shield and
securing them of
word into the system case they also
cover all the power connectors you'll
have to configure as well as the front
panel connectors for things like the
case power case reset all that kind of
stuff let's get this board out and this
is another one of my favorite things
about eega boards I'm going to break the
suspense in just a moment as soon as I
get the board out of the bag this thing
please read before CPU installation that
is the funniest thing ever step one and
step two and step three and step four
so they actually give you all of the
instructions to install your CPU in such
a way that you cannot possibly even
attempt it without reading the
instructions so like all each 55
motherboards we've got support for dual
channel ddr3 memory we have an LGA 1156
socket here they are I can't tell what
brand of socket they're using so I guess
we won't get too much further into that
power connectors are in there almost
optimal locations we've got the 24 pin
here but the 4 pin is kind of in
no-man's land all over here something to
note though because this is a micro ATX
motherboard the odds of it being a bad
thing for the 4 pin power to be here are
much less because many micro ATX cases
don't actually have conventional layouts
in terms of where the motherboard and
the power supply goes so it's quite
possible you won't run into any problems
with that now there is one that is a bit
of a problem I don't really like the
layout of the SATA ports because the PCI
Express connector here if you have a
dual slot card is actually going to
potentially cover these three ports and
make it difficult to access them that
said this is a fairly low-end board so
if you're installing an adding graphics
card you're probably not putting in a
super high-end long one so for most
people it's probably going to be a
non-issue like I said before if SATA
ports so we've got five here down at the
bottom USB headers there are plenty
there are one two three four USB headers
and they're color-coded bright pink so
that you can find them very easily next
we've got to the chipset and the age 55
chips that obviously doesn't produce a
whole lot of heat you've got this little
tiny heatsink on it not a whole lot
going on in
I think next we've got expansion so
you've got one legacy PCI slot one PCIe
1x slot one PCIe 4x slot and one pipe
PCIe 16x graphic slot
I wouldn't remind it seeing those
switched around so that you can use a
graphics card and the 4x slot but really
there aren't too many adding cards that
go into a 4x lot these days so I
wouldn't worry too much about it this
appears to be front panel audio and then
I guess that pretty much does it for the
top side of the board let me see if
there's anything else noteworthy looks
like this before
there this is totally irrelevant and I
don't know what it does but I've never
seen one of these on a motherboard
before that is all let's go around to
the back panel so you've got two ps2
ports one for the mouse one for the
keyboard and let's get a little bit more
into this onboard video issue you've got
a VGA port a DVI port and an HDMI port
now unless you're using a core i3 or a
Core i5 dual core and please note that
I'm grouping in the Pentium dual core
LGA 1156 with the core i3 LGA 1156 all
of those feature onboard video on the
CPU so that means that all it is is a
pass-through from the CPUs onboard video
to these ports so unless you're using a
CPU with onboard video they're just dead
ports for decoration you can plug
something into them but they won't do
anything next we have 4 USB ports that's
not a lot of USB ports 4 for an aged 55
motherboard but I mean you can always
use a hub it's not that big of a deal
you've got a Gigabit Ethernet port one
eSATA port that's really nice to see on
such an entry-level board and then
you've got 7.1 Audio thanks for checking
out my quick unboxing and product
overview of the EVGA h50 5v</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
