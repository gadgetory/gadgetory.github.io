NAB 2017 coverage learn more about the
Mk II elements GoPro microphone and
their other audio for video products at
the link in the video description
NAB 2017 is well underway so let's check
out our top five camera accessories from
around the show floor starting us off at
Sennheiser MKE 2 elements this is a new
microphone Sennheiser is made in
partnership with GoPro the microphone
uses Sennheiser MKE 2 capsule and uses a
rubber base to prevent vibrations from
affecting sound in all the various
mounting situations you may face the mic
is omnidirectional and is designed to
withstand extreme cold and the wettest
environments you could throw at the
hero4 the mic itself is an ipx7 rating
and was recently taken first bin in
various wet environments by linus in his
full review here sennheiser is also
working on a version of this mic for the
Hero 5 that will be coming out soon our
second accessory in this roundup is from
Spyder holsters newest addition in their
lineup of products the Spyder light now
some of you may know that I've been
using Spyder holsters Black Widow to
carry my xt 2 for a while now the Spyder
light attempts to improve on the black
widows design it sports an all-metal
body with a smaller footprint than its
predecessor as well as a new clip system
that makes it easier to put on and
remove from your belt
unlike the Black Widow where in order to
take it off you have to remove your belt
entirely Spyder also includes a new and
improved plate for your camera that
doubles as an ARCA Swiss plate for
tripods that use that standard with the
added bonus that this plate can also
have a different tripod plate added to
the bottom thanks to its quarter-twenty
thread spider has also added an optional
accessory that allows use of the Spyder
light on a backpack strap for those who
travel with backpacks often a nice
addition since I constantly find myself
carrying a backpack when traveling next
up is man photos new nitro tech fluid
head man photo has designed this head
with a nitrogen piston in the middle
which may sound a little weird but it
allows for a continuous counterbalance
without the need to reset the head to
neutral tilt unlike on their previous
video heads the nitro tech has a payload
of 17.6 pounds to accommodate mid-sized
production cameras and both the pan and
tilt friction adjustments have been
improved to be more grippy than previous
heads in their lineup moving on we have
the free cast Universal a wireless
transmitter and receiver system
freak-ass universal works with any
camera that has an HDMI out allowing you
to stream from your camera to any iOS
device or monitor that can take an hdmi
in when transmitting the pre-cast
Universal has a range of 500 meters and
can be powered via their rechargeable
batteries or the USB input on each
receiver and transmitter audio wise you
can use audio going directly into your
camera or for those who want to use an
external microphone the free catch
Universal Translator sports a 3.5
millimeter audio input allowing a wide
variety of mic Solutions currently on
the market
along with monitoring your camera from
multiple devices the free cast can
stream live directly to different social
media platforms currently free cast only
offers support for YouTube or Facebook
but the company says that they'll be
adding twitch and Instagram Live support
among others when they do the full
release of the free cash Universal later
this year lastly we have surfs new genie
to building on their existing motion
control systems for time-lapse and video
production the Genie 2 adds a new pen
and tilt head that supports a heavier
payload of 5 kilograms and is also much
quieter than its predecessor the Genie 2
is also available in a kit with their
new linear drive module which uses a
rope system for controlled horizontal
movement on nearly any slider on the
market surf has also opted for type C
charging on the genie too these ports
also double as a way to power cameras
like Sony's a7s2 that have less than
optimal battery life for time-lapse the
genie 2 can be controlled with surfs
existing app for the rest of their
products or with the hardware buttons on
the device for less complicated movement
with other motion control systems on the
market getting more complicated surface
striving to keep usability as
streamlined as possible allowing
creatives to focus on the other
challenges of their work instead of
worrying about gear and approach that I
can appreciate
so thank you guys for watching let me

this roundup was in the comments down
