be unboxing a new product from
SteelSeries so this is the Siberia
full-size headset but what you probably
can't see is that there's a little v2
here so the v2 version of the Siberia
headset which is quite popular makes a
couple of key changes first of all
they've done away with the clip-on mic
so it used to be it was just kind of a
headphone and then a clip-on mic that
you put on the wire or your shirt which
I've always thought was kind of a ghetto
solution but you still can do that by
buying Siberia headphones and then just
like a random third-party clip-on mic
neither here nor there
they've also improved the comfort level
of these heads of this headset as well
as the sound quality so they've actually
made a lot of improvements over the
older Siberia so without further ado why
don't we hurry up and get this box open
so you start by removing the tab at back
now SteelSeries is not you know known as
an audiophile class headphone but it's
not really what they market their
products towards what they do market
them towards is gamers so what they're
saying is that it is pro gaming
optimized which means crystal-clear
highs lows and mid-tones and these are
also closed type headphones and what
close means is that when you have the
ear cups over your ears it blocks out
the outside noise so that you don't get
distracted by any other noises that you
hear and it also means that others
cannot hear what's going on inside the
earphones or headphones sorry either
okay so I kind of don't know where I was
going with that but without further ado
here is the SteelSeries professional
gaming gear pamphlet which shows you a
bunch of their other products that would
go along with this one okay thank you
very much and then ah what is this
to avoid permanent hearing all it's
telling you not to turn it up too loud
to hurt your hearing ok so then you've
got a SteelSeries sticker ok and then we
get to the cables so this is not a USB
version of one of their headsets this is
one of the standard ones that plugs
directly into a sound card they do have
ones that
USB sound cards looks like they've also
made some improvements to the inline
volume and mic switch but I'm not a
hundred percent sure about that because
I have a different one myself so you've
got a mic on and off button here and
what I like about this this is actually
quite hard to hit by accident because
it's flush with the rest of it a lot of
gamers tend to bump these and then they
go berserk when their mics don't work
I've seen it happen many times then you
got your volume control on the side now
one thing that SteelSeries does with
most if not all of their headsets is
they include kind of a two length cable
so here the cable terminates where you
can plug into the back of something like
a 7g keyboard or another keyboard that
has a pass-through audio and then it
also comes with a nice long extension
cord should you not have a setup like
that so if you don't use your front
audio or whatever then it's a long
enough cable to go around to the back of
your computer very nice ok so then next
thing we need to do is remove these
plastic tabs as well as these zip ties
at the nurse no zip ties sorry twist
ties at the back and then we can free
the headphones themselves now the v2s
are available in both black and white
but the version I have here today is the
white version as you can see all right
so they go on this way and something to
have a look at before you before you
sort of get too far into this is the way
that the headset is suspended so
SteelSeries claims and I'm about to find
out whether it's true in a moment that
the suspension mechanism that they have
here makes the headphones much more
lightweight and much more comfortable to
wear for extended periods and while I
can't vouch for extended periods I can
tell you right off the bat that these
are extremely light headphones and that
they do fit quite comfortably because
they use an enormous ear cup that is
very very soft it's kind of a soft
plethora material ok so then last but
not least
oh yeah uses 50 millimeter drivers I
should probably mention that so it's
quite a large driver for like a gaming
headset ok last thing is this is where
the mic is now included so rather than
having that clip-on mic I was talking
about before you have a little
retractable mic that is totally
adjustable so you can kind of like play
around with where you want it to sit
and I think that pretty much covers it
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the SteelSeries Siberia v2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
