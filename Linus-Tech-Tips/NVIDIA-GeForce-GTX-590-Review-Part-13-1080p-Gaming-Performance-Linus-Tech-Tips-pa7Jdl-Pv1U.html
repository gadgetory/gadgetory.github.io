it declares that you should insist on
nvidia and it also has some other pretty
good stuff on it
first of all nvidia is the number one
choice in pcs and consumer electronics
also all GeForce GPUs are vista
certified to the oldest Penance and is
the number one choice for extreme gamers
and nvidia defined the GPU category or
at least they acquired whoever did neat
actually that's not what we're doing t
today we're going to be having a look at
the GeForce GTX 590 this is going to be
only one of my performance review videos
of this particular card I'm going to do
a few one of them is going to be all
about 3d 3d vision so I'll only be
comparing against other GeForce cards in
that one I'm going to be doing one
heavyweight showdown between the GTX 590
and the Radeon HD 6990 and that will
actually be at a different resolution so
battle is going to be at 2560 by 1600
with this beast of a monitor right here
okay so that's my my 30-inch monitor but
this one right here that you're watching
is going to be all about 1080p
performance now the GTX 590 and the 6990
for that matter are both a little bit
overpowered for 1080p so what you're
going to see is that they will dominate
the performance charts in all likelihood
but we're not going to see them really
stretch their wings until you start to
get into things like 3d for example as
well as as well as HD plus resolutions
like 2560 by 1600 what that 30-inch
monitor uses so I'm going to talk a
little bit about my testing methodology
for most of these games on using 4x
anti-aliasing at the max I am running
all of the games at extreme maximum
settings except for Crysis I turn motion
blur to medium because it bothers me
when it's any higher than
I don't like playing the game that way
so I just turn it off um yeah I think
that's all there is to say so we're
going to be looking at Hawks too Lost
Planet 2 Metro 2033 so that's a
civilization 5 so those are some DirectX
11 titles for us we've got Battlefield
Bad Company 2 Far Cry 2 and Crysis 2
have a look at some DX 10 gaming any one
of these GPUs is going to run any
DirectX 9 title great so I personally
don't find it all that relevant we're
going to be looking at next gen features
like tessellation more than anything
else
all of those DirectX 11 titles do
support tessellation in some way shape
or form so that's going to be a emphasis
of what we're doing today so in terms of
the configurations we're looking at this
is going to be extreme performance stuff
only we're not going to be looking at
any dinky stuff so we've got the 590 the
Radeon 6990 these are the two flagship
$700 MSRP cards from Nvidia and AMD
respectively we're also going to be
looking at the GTX 580 sli which is
another solution that gives you extreme
performance on dual cards rather than on
a single card because the two GTX 580 s
are clocked higher than the GPUs on the
590 but they have the drawback of
consuming more power
kicking off more heat and taking up four
slots in your computer rather than only
two okay so there's that and then we've
also got a single 6970 a single GTX 580
and then I've also thrown in GTX 560 TI
sli so these two cards don't appear to
match but actually they do and that is
it's just an interesting configuration
because it's a pretty good value for a
high-end gaming system and I just wanted
to see how it stacks up against what is
essentially a Down clocked GF 110
dual GPU solution versus a fully clocked
GTX 560 ti dual GPU solution so stay
tuned guys for charts and graphs
you
so one of the things I did not mention
in my introduction was my test bench I
should probably cover that so I've got a
core i7 2670 Bridge processor at 4.7
gigahertz I've got eight gigs of muskan
redline ddr3 1600 gram I've got an ass
Rock fatality motherboard I've got an
Intel 510 series 120 gig SSD and that's
pretty much it for the relevant
performance related stuff so let's talk
the overall results so I'll go through
the games individually Hox two scales
great the CPU is able to allow pretty
much any of these cards to reach their
full potential and shows us how they all
perform relative to each other to an
extent the Radeon cards don't perform
nearly as well in Hawke's - as the
geforce cards and thats an architectural
thing could be driver related either way
they get left in the dust they get
creamed even the 6990 losses - gtx 560
sli and a single GTX 580 so that's
that's kind of an interesting thing
about that but it does allow us to show
the relative performance of the GeForce
solutions against each other at the very
least Lost Planet 2 is another one is a
very demanding game we are not CPU
limited in any way in this particular
title so each of the GPUs is able to
really stretch their rings and show us
what it is capable of so you see the 590
come out ahead of the 69 90 in this
particular game as well Metro 2033 is
another example of a game that all of
the GPUs are able to perform quite well
and so the 580 sli actually performs
about the same as the 69 90 which means
that the GTX 590 which doesn't perform
as well as 580 SLI due to the lower
clock speed actually falls behind a
little bit in that title that's the
first one so I can't say as well
Battlefield Bad Company 2 is another one
where we actually see pretty good
scaling and we also see fairly close but
I would say this is pretty much at AI
fairly close performance between the 590
and the 6990 so say five this one seems
to be fairly CPU limited although we do
get a little bit of a performance
increase with the 580 the anomaly here
is 560 SLI which performs just as well
as 580 SLI I got no idea why that is but
I ran it again and again and again so my
for my sieve five benchmark basically I
take a very very late-game
savegame that I have from actually
playing the game and then I've got about
thirty some-odd cities on the screen and
then i zoom out all the way and I take a
reading over a period of time and then
average it out so pretty much we're just
looking at the same static image we're
centered over one of the cities so each
of the cars is rendering exactly the
same thing but that particular solution
performs really well could be a driver
thing that's preventing the single card
solutions from performing as well as the
dual card solutions not really sure what
we're looking at there for far cry 2
yeah we're pretty much CPU limited at
that point we are not in any way GPU
bound any one of these graphics cards is
going to be able to give you a very good
experience in far cry 2 if you actually
still play that game Crysis is another
one looks like we are not going to be
able to observe much in the way of
scaling the one that really falls behind
in far cry 2 is the 69 70 but the sixty
nine ninety actually performs output it
performs on top it actually outperforms
even the GTX 580 s so at 1080p it looks
like for the most part the 590 and the
6990 are going to be trading blows so
it's going to take our testing at 2560
by 1600 to really separate the men from
the boys in this case remember 2560 by
1600 is going to be an advantage for
anyone who's got better multi-gpu
scaling whether it's Nvidia or AMD it's
also going to be an advantage for
whoever has the most GPU power because
you're going to be far less likely to
run into CPU limitations at that kind of
a resolution but it should give AMD a
distinct advantage because more
resolution means you need more video RAM
in the 6990
actually has four gigs of RAM two per
GPU whereas the 590 has three gigs of
RAM 1.5 gigs per GPU so that may be a
bit of an advantage the only way to know
is to try out some titles out that res
