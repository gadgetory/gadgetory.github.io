to be to evaluate quad crossfire with
dual Radeon 69 90s which you can see on
my bench right now against Quad SLI with
dual dual dual dual GTX 590 so those are
about to go on the bench so I'm going to
be using a different test platform from
what I normally use this is a gigabyte
g1 sniper motherboard and it is running
with an Intel Core i7 980 X at 4.2 6
gigahertz or something like that so I'm
well over 4 gigahertz I have 12 gigs a
ddr3 1600 RAM I am using a different
power supply as well but I bought my
regular testing hard drive and then
because my external drive broke I'm
using a WD green drive for my steam file
so that is the test bench I will be
using to determine which of these
configurations runs better you may have
noticed already that it's a little on
the warm side no not warm side it's a
little on the loud side the reason for
that is that you can see these rubber
spacers that come on the 6990 S here yep
now you can get that is to give it si
you can see at the bottom it's very
close together at the top it's slightly
separated that gives it a little bit of
a gap for that fan to intake air but it
still has to work pretty hard to cool
those two GPUs so it is a little on the
loud side here you can see my Lost
Planet 2 results I'm going to be
comparing the quad crossfire against the
Quad SLI and then if I have time I will
also run individual 6992 X 590 numbers
to compare against their dual graphics
equivalents although that it's not
equivalent at all so I've got most of my
testing done I'm just running a Lost
Planet 2 bench on the GTX 590 Quad SLI
configuration so I've note about this
particular video is the fact that I will
be using a higher resolution than normal
you can see my 1920 by 1080 monitor is
actually back
they're behind my 30-inch 2560 by 1600
monitor also because we are using very
high end GPU configurations I will be
using higher anti aliasing anisotropic
filtering settings and I normally do so
I'll be cranking up as high as they go
for all of the games in my testing suite
which will be Battlefield Bad Company 2
Crysis 2 metro 2033 and Lost Planet 2 so
for the first three games I'll be doing
my own custom run throughs recorded with
fraps and for Lost Planet 2 amusing test
B you can see here I have the GTX 590 s
on the test bench they're not nearly as
loud this is 69 90s although they do get
toasty and they do get loud running in a
configuration like this especially that
top card although you can see the
spacing is significantly more than we
were seeing previously with our other
config connection see all the way
through it and both cards are able to
sit straight in their slots you may ask
why I chose to use the slots that are
right next to each other on this board
versus this one right here and the
reason as you can see in the PCIe slot
there is that this bottom slot is only
wired for 8x so if I were to use these
to high-end GPUs in the top and the
bottom PCIe 16x slots on the g1 sniper
I'd be running them at 16x + 8 X mode
respectively and based on my recent
testing with PCIe bandwidth I felt that
was not really appropriate so I would
have liked to use the 2 16 X slots which
is what I've decided to do here so I
will be back with the results once I'm
finished running my single GTX 590 tests
alright guys so I'm using the latest
drivers available at the time of filming
and benchmarking which is all on the
same night tonight and here are the
settings that I was using so Crysis 2 is
obviously at maximum so the game that
scaled the best out of the ones in my
test suite was obviously Battlefield Bad
Company 2 the 69 90s um actually scale
more than a hundred percent which makes
no sense but we'll just consider that
within the margin of error and we'll
call it a hundred percent scaling and
then for the five 90s we saw almost 100%
scaling something like ninety percent
scaling so excellent scaling on that
particular game 590 scale
very very well in crisis to 6990 besides
the flickering bug which made the game
pretty much unplayable also didn't scale
very well Ambu has some work to do on
the crisis to performance of their 6990
but I'm sure that's something they'll
resolve with a driver issue in the
future Metro 2033 6990 scaled quite well
adding another 50% performance to itself
as well as the 590 590 actually scaled
quite well as well but still fall short
of the quad crossfire setup in terms of
overall performance on Lost Planet 2 we
see very poor scaling across the board
and the 590 SLI beetle crossfire as well
as on Battlefield Bad Company 2 the 590
Quad SLI wins so basically the objective
today was not to determine a clear
winner it was more to look at the state
of quad GPU gaming as a whole I'm not
going to say who but I will actually
okay I've got blue screens with both
solutions during my testing among other
sort of random issues that did crop up
so I'd go as far as to say that there's
definitely some work to do on the
drivers for both of these cards and but
once that's resolved they definitely
deliver some crazy performance numbers
in the right scenarios remember these
are all benchmarked at 2560 by 1600 so
we're looking at that'll feel bad
company 2 numbers well over 100 fps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
