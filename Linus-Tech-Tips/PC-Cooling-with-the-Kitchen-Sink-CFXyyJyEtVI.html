so you've just got your brand-new PC and
you want to do some overclocking but
that like that tiny air Goulet you have
is just not doing it so you could get
like a radiator a pump and a reservoir
but all that's pretty damn expensive so
what if you just buy the block and hook
it up to your sink
well Linus said that's a bad idea but
he's on vacation so we're gonna do it
let's do it yeah madrenas coffee blend
specialty cold brew coffee Xin 215 ounce
grab and go cans for your convenience
check them out and use offer code Linus
to save 40% 40% at the link below so
first thing we need to do here is just
get some baseline readings so what do we
have in here Jake this is a Intel Core i
970 900 X we have a Titan X P not P but
Pascal same thing we got a X 1500 I
which is super overkill but really what
we need to look at is the temperatures
here so in the hottest core we're
looking at about 56 degrees this is at
the stock clock so I guess she'll be
overclocked at first no let's wait until
we get the sink going right yeah let's
just see how it performs compared to the
sink and go from it and that's what the
360 mil K water blocks rad oh oh that's
my favorite technique just give her a
good blow some damnit I hear Jesus do
you know that's gonna seal very well
does it even stick them doesn't matter
though
I bet you if we put a fitting on that
end of the tube it would be easier to
like make this two metal surfaces
together oh why did you let it go
alright let's just stuck in the st. I'm
gonna get another fitting in this guy
what an amateur hey I got it we don't
need Jake okay we're just we're just
doing it yep we most certainly do oh
geez it's a bad idea I'm gonna go get
some duct tape because I don't think
that your tape is good enough dude what
happened last time you talked to it is
there video footage of that leaking
yeah it got dropped it was fine until we
put it under pressure it was fine until
it like needed to work and then it
didn't I don't think they engineered
this around being able to do this okay
so do you want to hold it and I'll tape
it
sure let's cut a piece off here what are
you prevent that perfect cool and I
guess you don't have to wait for this to
get up to equilibrium either right
yeah there's no equilibrium the water is
not recirculating or just at it so at
idle we're sitting at about 14 degrees
or so just how you get sub ambient you
remember that's you shouldn't go up it's
gonna go up some like a bed like I'm my
guess is 38 average that's really good
though oh my god
okay so we're getting hottest core as of
right now is 40 degrees which is what
like 16 below what it was before yeah 56
I think was the hottest core before
that's good do you like your water
cooling it's the best thing you've seen
all day yeah yeah what's wrong with that
well it's it's not too bad but but look
at our temperatures our hottest core on
a 70 900 X is 40 degrees that's not very
many degrees Wow Riley you're so
insightful I guess this is the best way
to want to cool the pc after all right 3
2 1 go you the sweeter shoes look okay
so we're gonna have to measure it from
the bottom of the meniscus so that was
eleven point eight seconds we'll be
using a hundred and fifty liters per
hour so let's I think before we
overclocked that we can take this to the
next extreme how is it gonna get better
than this so I can't hook it up to the
fridge well but do you know what we can
do with the fridge we can just take
yonder bucket of water okay so I'm kind
of missing but you get the idea so yeah
we've got this $22.00 submersible pump
so the idea is basically we have a
bucket we fill it with ice we put the
pump into the bucket of ice sink ghosts
a bucket goes to pump goes to thing goes
back to thing drains into the sink
oh we want that we want that over here
why what what what is with you and
putting the water back in the thing
because we're gonna have really cold
water so you want to have the cold water
kind of like doing its thing in here
yeah then we're just dumping hot water
into the cold like birth it's not going
to get like above ambient knock and the
time it goes through there all right
fine
and I don't think we can keep up with
the pump with this is there a speed
setting on there all right so pump is
getting plugged in now oh wow
do that thing that's kicking water dude
these boys are so cool we're gonna kill
the CPU for sure no this board is gonna
be dunzo so we're sitting at about yes
do we have a finite amount of time
before this but yeah luckily I have a
three three ish degrees so it's still
summer oh no it's 22 degrees in here
yeah our hottest core at the moment is
24 degrees so we aren't sub ambient
we're damn close like we're doing better
than we did with the chiller and so like
the total cost of this whole thing would
be like a cheap Aliexpress block you can
get those for like 15 to 20 bucks and
then 22 dollars for the pump you could
probably find a cheaper one and we are a
solid what 30 degrees lower you're at
than the six before more than 30 degrees
lower than a triple rad from ek five
gigahertz baby oh oh my god wait what
I think cinnamon just keeps crashing so
I think that we need more voltage we
have one point 4 volts yeah it's more
voltage it's crashing and the answer to
crashing is more voltage I think we need
Anthony oh hey Anthony we need you we
don't know how to overclock oh you know
how to over
Hey kinda yeah sure yep we're gonna
leave this up to you okay that's that's
what I was hoping that okay
okay see you later enjoy buddy okay okay
that's a thing all right so let's go
Ida go bolt egde so sitting at max of 11
degrees at the moment our voltage is one
point three seven five and one point or
two point one five input hey it's
working
ah doesn't works crashing no it dropped
down to 1.0 actually oh it does work hey
Lois there we go so we got a little
lower voltage wait we're basically at
similar temperatures to what we started
with except we're at five gigahertz now
instead of three point nine come on baby
oh damn it
dude there's so much water on those
tubes now oh yeah geez we don't have
much time Oh four point eight ah come on
baby oh you you can do it
we're at a hundred and one on one core
yeah we're still at four point eight
baby no we can drop the voltage to like
one point three five I guess I am
concerned this is a processor yeah it
might just not be a very good
overclocker I'm just so disappointed
yeah well sometimes you can't have nice
things
I guess that's part of the story right
he bottled the stuff you can't just go
return your CPU because actually you can
definitely do that because Amazon but
you're not supposed to just return your
CPU because it isn't overclocked well so
I guess we'll get to the best we can get
oh I had XMP on Oh
so we do you think that would hurt it
yeah oh oh oh we're screencap
ah did I do it did I do it what did you
change I changed everything to Otto
wait what's art wait wait don't go back
to our thing what is there where a point
for e what why did it what what okay so
well this is disappointing
alright four point eight baby it's how
does this what did you change you just
set it to auto auto everything that's
how you overclock X 299 so there's no
way at all that this could be done with
just regular water cooling no Lucy
that's like four point four four maybe
four point five this right here is
definitely like what you put in your
forum post Jill oh yeah this is so it
works then yeah you just want to get
another four or five hundred megahertz
to hopefully five hundred six thousand
yeah baby six sixty eighty eight yeah
once XP 100 I think we can push it a
little further you think we can go
further I think we're at ninety three
degrees there well I think I'll try to
leave the voltage another 100 megahertz
I'm gonna give her I'm gonna give her
one point three eight five but y'all got
it just turn it off
let's not plug it oh maybe it was fine
our last check get the can if we can't
do this then oh oh
holy oh it's doing it no it's not it's
done no it's not I go
so it's conclusion time I guess if your
goal is to just get the craziest
Cinebench or craziest 3dmark maybe plug
it into a sink is the way to go yeah
this worked surprisingly well like Andy
lid yeah yeah did you let it because we
absolutely destroyed the triple rad and
the whole thing cost like 50 bucks and
you could probably do it for cheaper
yeah if you get an aquarium pump from
like a hardware store you could prop or
used if I wouldn't use actually don't do
it yeah probably don't you need to
create a beautiful website without the
hassle we'll check out Squarespace bear
