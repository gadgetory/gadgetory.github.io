2 this is and I'm just quoting from the
packaging here first waterproof BT
headset can swim ipx8 certified to
waterproof 3 meter 24 hours
noise rebound technology makes clear
talk 13 hours extra long talk and music
time and it has stereo earphones
included for music as well as waterproof
earphone included check that out so this
is a pretty unique product in that ok
well here hold on let's go through all
the others ok has a 30 360 million power
lithium polymer battery it has ok we've
covered the lung okay standby for 240
hours and it uses bluetooth version 2.1
ok so we'll have a look at you hopefully
that piece of paper is also waterproof
because it fell in the very scummy water
that's near our office here I'm just
gonna
that's their deal on it
okay Oh lifetime warranty and you know
what I think the card is waterproof
advice it's plastic sweet okay so I'm
just gonna yeah dry that off there and
please inform us serial number and by
date but by facebook that's to get your
lifetime warranty no way you register
your lifetime warranty on Facebook okay
they've also got some some terms and
conditions for their warranty okay yeah
we've got what else is inside here so
here is the actual bluetooth device
itself has a little clip so I guess you
could you could clip that there to your
swim goggles if you were swimming with
your Bluetooth headset there's a
presumably volume up and volume down
neutral button or Zi Zi okay let me see
what else do we got here so we have one
set of waterproof headphones so this is
for listening to music on your music
enabled Bluetooth enabled phone okay
left and right I can tell you how
comfortable they are
hey that's not bad wow that's a really
noisy truck behind us sorry guys then
there is a USB charger cable so that's
probably gonna plug in here there you go
so that's how to charge it
I've seen these adapters before then we
have the actual bluetooth earpiece bit I
guess well how does it actually hear you
hold on well this can't be okay no talk
in music time well it has to be able to
hear you somehow right hold on we better
pause this one while I figure this out
so I took three NCIX employees and the
manual here to figure this out we'll go
through the manual in a minute because
it's definitely worthwhile but I do want
to explain exactly how this device works
so you can see out of the box we took
the the waterproof bag which uses a
double seal as well as a folding flap of
plastic to keep water away from your
iPhone this is the camera man's iPhone
okay so we got two ziplock seals here
and then we just put the iPhone in there
you fold this up and then you just use a
velcro to keep that shut okay and then
the way that the if the wave tooth
itself actually works is you use the Z
button in the middle for pairing to
answer and to make calls and then this
changes your audio track and then this
is the volume button
oh I apparently I just made a call sorry
sorry 10/10 don't answer that
don't answer that sorry it was my bad
okay I hung it up now so that that's
what we were using for testing now the
microphone is actually here alright so
something that I want to explain about
this is it is waterproof now bear in
mind the mono earpiece is the only one
that's waterproof the stereo one is not
it's waterproof so you can kind of like
listen to music okay while you're
swimming or whatever it is you're doing
that you need a waterproof sound system
for but you can't actually talk on it in
the water which makes sense so suppose
someone calls you you hear it in your
Bluetooth you get out of the pool or you
get away from the water and then you
talking to the Micra
phone and it should hang around your
neck or it has a clip on it where you
can clip it to your collar or something
like that so and then this has a strap
on it so you can keep your phone
somewhere conveniently close by alright
so now let's go through the manual that
helped us to determine all of these
things first of all the microphone it is
made waterproof and don't worry water go
inside don't put sharp things into this
hole so make sure you do not put sharp
things into that hole okay let's find
out what else okay see rust and sweat
may rust the sea water and sweat my rust
the headphone jack so be careful with
that if you go swimming in the in the
ocean
don't pair to ktouch and china cell
phones that will make B fu Zi miss
function so make sure you don't do that
not recommended for use with water
skiing is it may hit your body and
there's a rubber band here to prevent
sands going inside you can use your own
headphones if you prefer okay the we've
tooths core is sealed just pour out
water and keep using okay a headphone
maintenance please take special care on
the headphone head because it is very
weak don't force on here when you insert
it so be very careful with that use
clean water to clean it out let me see
if there was anything else on here that
was very pressing oh please ensure the
jack hole is dry when you charge the
battery
whenever you're charging the battery
ensure the jack hole is dry because
remember you do use the headphone jack
hole in order to plug in the USB adapter
see here okay so that plugs in there
alright so I think that's pretty much
and everything to say about weaved
and thank you for checking out the
