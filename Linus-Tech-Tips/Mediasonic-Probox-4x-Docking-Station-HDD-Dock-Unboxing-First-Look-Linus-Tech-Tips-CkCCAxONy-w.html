sonic Pro box
HFD 1 - su 3 s - docking station what
you need to remember is not necessarily
the model number but what's actually
cool about this little external docking
station so we're just going to open it
right up and get started here it's not
small and it's not that cheap for one of
these docking stations but what's really
cool about it is the fact that it
supports four drives and each of the
drives has warning do not install a
remove hard drive during file
transmission must turn off slot power
before installing or removing your hard
drive movement in part drive while power
to being used will damage the hard drive
and risk lots of doubt ok these are all
relevant things but it actually has
individual power buttons for each of the
hard drive slots which I personally
think is really cool because you can
decide which ones you want to use and
which ones you don't want even so inside
you find a variety of different things
including a power cable a power brick
which plugs into the power cable which
then plugs into the wall and into the
unit itself also a USB 3.0 cable as well
as a head pin and eSATA cable so it
includes all of the cables you need as
well as some brief notes in the quick
installation guide on how to use it so
it gives you a couple different things
so your power indicator blue means it's
powered on orange means it's accesing ok
hard drive status power on or hard drive
accessing oh ok ok ok ok ok ok so
where's the power
that one's there so that means
something's being accessed and then here
is the individual one very good hard
drive power buttons press to power on or
off the hard drive slot neat follow
instructions do not place near water
basically be careful with it some basic
reminders ok shows you how to install a
drive although we'll show you how to
install
because that's fairly straightforward so
I actually brought myself a variety of
different drives to install in the media
sonic 4x documentation not 4x like
foreign-exchange 4x like x 4 just to
clarify in case you guys sort of were
confused by that all right so let's show
you how this all works something unit
itself actually I guess let me just get
these uh plasticky bits off here no I'm
having trouble with that so I will do
what oh no right I will not give up I
will okay so we got kind of a shiny
thing good finish going on here we got
some more plastic that I haven't managed
to remove yet there we go beautiful you
got our power button here which also has
the indicator LED built into here in the
front we've got our interfaces in the
back so there's our power
there's eSATA and there is our USB 3
side looks like the side oh look at this
adorable suction cups so if I had a
table that wasn't native cloth because
clearly that won't work then I could
suction it on so that it wouldn't like
know anywhere accidentally because how
much would that suck if you have like
four drives in here and you were like oh
hey did you see the Wow and then all you
guys fell down so there you go suction
cups neat so let's show you guys how to
hook it up so you just go ahead and plug
this thing into this thing yeah thank
you for getting that angle there
plug this thing into this thing mm-hmm
and then you plug the things into the
other thing so you put it in this way so
it's compatible with either two and a
half inch or three and a half inch
drives it's also compatible with the
latest drives which means that even if
you're using a an advanced format drive
or whatever this doesn't care okay so
let's just load this baby up this is
just a couple old 320 gig drives that's
a newer one with the one terabyte
platters and then this is a two and a
half inch
Momentis XT and let's go ahead and try
this out shall we so we've got it hooked
up to my computer now we're just going
to power on the unit itself and you can
see none of the drives have their
indicator LEDs on because we haven't
actually powered any of them up so let's
try powering up one Drive LED turns on
and we'll see what happens I don't know
that that dried actually has any um any
partitions on it so let's go into Disk
Management no that's just my boot drive
okay let's try another one
could be broken too because I sort of
was not driving very well on the way
home and it was sitting next to one of
the other drives so I hear something
moving now
okay let's try action rescan disks ah
there we go that one worked Oh
fail okay literally fail my hardened I
failed okay let's try that next one
let's see if this one died to you
because I sold it was sitting next to oh
man how does this work
okay hold on action three scan discs
installing device driver software here
we go yeah yeah you have there we go
there we go okay so that one works oh
yeah that drives like definitely dead
okay now let's turn on the 750 and
action rescan discs cool so there you go
you can just pick whatever drives you
want to have accessible or not have
accessible it's highly recommended that
before you remove the drives you power
them down and that gives them what's
also cool about this the fact that here
yeah there you go the 750 is now
detected there it is so check this out
guys so with a lot of these hard drive
docks the only way to power down the
drive is to physically remove it but
that can be that can be devastating for
the internal moving parts so this way
you can safely power down your drive
that still works wait for it to spin
down I'm not going to wait long enough
here because I'm sort of for pretty much
finished with this video and then remove
it once it's no longer moving so thank
you for checking out this video on the
media sonic 4x
