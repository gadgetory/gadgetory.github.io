to take a couple seconds and don't cheat
don't look at the title of the video
because I always do this and everyone
always looks at the title of the video
and they're like old - I didn't have to
guess cuz I just looked at the title of
the video haha okay try to actually
guess what it is without looking at the
title of the video it's a heat sink it's
a heat sink and the box is like the size
of my head look at this that I turned it
like this yet
cameraman screwed up you press the wrong
button so this is the silver arrow it is
compatible with LGA 1366 1156 775 as
well as AMD socket am-2 am-3 so it's
compatible with every socket on the
market that matters and it is huge
according to the box anyway I haven't
actually got it open yet so I'm not a
hundred percent sure the first thing I
find inside is just a listing of
everything that comes in the package so
it shows you all the different mounting
hardware you get it actually comes with
a little wrench it comes with some
little vibration dampening triangles it
comes with some thermal compound alright
then we have a little exploded related
view exploded view I want a sticker so
this is an exploded view of how to
operate the intel mounting hardware
okay so there's step-by-step
instructions on the back they show you
how to line up all the different holes
for 775 1156
and 1366 and then here we have the AMD
mounting hardware which is actually way
simpler it's just a little bracket that
clamps down on top of the cooler and
then goes right into the stock backplate
from your a.m. - or a.m. 3 socket so you
can see it's only a six step process
including like plugging in the fans and
stuff
that's a very very straightforward on
the AMD side here we have a thermal
write sticker and here we have all of
the included goodies so this okay the
first thing that comes to mind besides
the fact that the fans are kind of an
unattractive color is the fact that this
has the thickest heat pipes on it out of
any cooler I had ever seen so let's have
a quick look at these fans
these look like 140 millimeter fans but
they actually use a circular frame and
120 millimeter mounting holes so that
means that you should have better
compatibility with with most cases on
the market or with most coolers on the
market although these are obviously
designed to be used with this particular
cooler but you do get that additional
fan blade size and you do get a little
bit more airflow out of it and in theory
a 140 millimeter fan spinning at the
same rpm as a 120 millimeter fan is
going to net you more airflow and better
cooling so okay here we'll have a look
at the accessories that are included
first and then I'll show you the cooler
I know if you want you can just skip
ahead and see the cooler but if you want
to see the accessories then this is the
time to see them okay lots and lots and
lots of stuff included here so the first
thing we see these are some mounting
clips for the fan so we have four
because this is a dual fan cooler so you
can hook up two fans then we have the
included wrench as well as some included
CF three thermal compound okay next we
have the AMD mounting hardware so the
way this one works oh no this is a
universal piece okay so this is the
hold-down for the cooler in general as
far as I can tell okay this is the AMD
specific piece and then this is the
Intel pulled down as well as the Intel
backplate so you can see it's got the
slidable posts so you can go through 775
1156
or 1366 without any difficulty
all right we've got some thumb screws
here that are actually not just thumb
screws they're the ones that you can
actually screw something into the top of
as well
okay so mounting system all looks very
very solid every single piece of it is
made out of like thick steel look how
thick the steel is so you don't have to
worry about anything getting broken if
you're shipping your system like NCIX
the the store I work at we actually
build systems and you can buy a system
with an aftermarket cooler on it but if
you buy one that has a cheap mounting
system that's made out of some kind of a
brittle plastic or anything like that
then the cooler can actually I mean look
how big this thing is it could snap off
in shipping but as long as you include
like a huge steel backplate and mounting
bracket for it it's not going anywhere
so that's uh that's something that you
might not think about if you're just
your average end-user but is very
important to a system builder who's
considering using a heatsink like this
in a system so this is the silver arrow
okay okay the heat pipes are not as big
as I had originally thought
I thought the heat pipes were actually
this big but these look like they're
just eight millimeter heat pipes which
are still huge so I'm gonna just go
ahead and say this this reminds me
already
a lot of the co gauge Aero so this is
the Silver Arrow which is released under
the thermal right branding as you may or
may not already be aware Co gauge is
owned by thermal right so it's uh not
like we're seeing thermal right knock
somebody off I want to make sure nobody
thinks that there's our obligatory
finger shot where you can see how shiny
and typically how flat thermal right
spaces are so this is not them ripping
it off this is them taking the the co
gauge branded design making it more
blingy
so unlike the Colgate one which uses a
flat finish on all of the fins this one
actually uses a very very shiny finish
so I can I can see myself in this no
problem and see if I can look at the
camera there yeah so you can see my
glasses in the top of it so that means
if you have a litte case like if you
have any cathodes or anything like that
in your computer case you will be able
to see the light shining off this really
nicely the overall design that it looks
quite similar
the arrow uses huge thick heat pipes as
well and you know what since I'm you
know not really talking about anything
else for now why don't I just sort of
have a quick look at how to mount the
fans so if it works the same way as the
arrow which I'm going to go ahead and
assume it probably does we're going to
use the little okay well we'll use the
fan clips then ah there there we'll use
the little triangles which I have found
now as a vibration dampening thing okay
I sure hope I'm right about this
yeah I'm right okay good I hate it when
I make assumptions and I end up not
being right so we just go ahead and
throw those on the corners now that's
not going to have a negative impact on
performance because not a whole lot of
air throw air flow goes through the
corner anyway so then all you do is you
position your fan in the right place so
you can actually use one twenty
millimeter fans but I'm using the
included thermal right ones here and
then you use your lips to put them
through the hole here ah they use quite
a flexible clip with this one that's
really nice makes it a lot easier to
thread it through the hole in the top
and the bottom of the heat sink so just
like that just being careful to drive it
through straight because it actually has
to go through quite a good number of
these fins and then all you do is
position the fan in the right place
angle like that then you do that on both
sides and you have mounted the fat now
it's got a ton of fan mounting options
you can mount it with one fan here one
fan in the middle one fan on the other
side so you can do up to three fans or
you could even just do one in the middle
so you can see you got mounting holes
here here here and here
so while there's not enough room for two
fans in the middle for obvious reasons
you can use either of these two to mount
the middle fan and then you can mount
two fans on the outside as well so it's
very very flexible in terms of mounting
options and one thing that I have
noticed about the Coe gauge arrow which
I'm going to assume is the same for the
silver arrow is that the motherboard
compatibility is a little bit better
than some of the competing huge duel
tower coolers such as the Noctua NHD 14
the reason for that is just the way
they've positioned the heat pipes here
keeps them a little bit more out of the
way of your of your motherboard MOSFET
coolers so I actually was able to mount
the Coe gauge arrow on a motherboard
that I wasn't able to mount any other
huge high performance coolers on so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the thermal rate Silver Arrow and I
hope you have enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
