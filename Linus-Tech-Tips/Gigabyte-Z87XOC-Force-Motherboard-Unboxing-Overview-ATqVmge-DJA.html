learn more welcome to my unboxing an
overview of a product that's probably
designed more for people who don't pay
for hardware than for people who
actually buy their own hardware so it is
expensive and over built to the point
where it's hardly even practical unless
you're one of those guys who's going for
every possible frequency record whether
it's on CPU or memory or whatever else
and it farted or whatever else the case
may be this is the z87 x OC force from
gigabyte a proud continuation of the OC
board traditions of orange slots black
PCBs a beautiful aesthetics and over
built design so we've got a 2-way SLI
bridge a 3-way SLI bridge a four-way SLI
bridge a 16 Way SLI have no I'm just
kidding actually this is really cool so
this is what they're calling the OC
brace and it is basically a way to
attach PCI brackets to the back of the
board when it's on a test bench to
support your cards so they don't lean
over I mean that is so cool it's the
kind of thing that no one who actually
pays for hardware and put some
motherboard inside a case will ever care
about but Lee come on that's so cool
I love it anyway two-way crossfire
bridge V checkpoint adapter so you can
monitor your voltages I'll show you
those on the motherboard itself six SATA
cables looks like yeah three a right
angle three straight connectors and
tenez for the built-in Wireless so there
you go wireless
n as well as Bluetooth card so that's a
PCIe 1x card you could install it in
this board you could buy this board
install it in some other board wouldn't
matter it's just a proper piece yet you
one X card front panel three and a half
inch Bay USB 3.0
doohickey um there's some kind of USB
cable for probably something uh yeah
that's right that's for the Wi-Fi cards
and then we've got an i/o shield as well
as all the documentation that you can
conveniently find on the Internet's
which to my understanding is something
to do with tubes or something like that
which leads us to the motherboard itself
want to take you guys on a tour I
actually had someone tell me sockets or
sockets not that long ago when I was
doing a video and I was saying how
gigabyte has their whole 15 micro
gold-plated CPU memory PCI Express pin
thing going on and the truth of the
matter is that no not all sockets are
manufactured and provided by Intel and
there are more expensive and less
expensive socket implementations that
the manufacturers can put on their
motherboards so gigabyte has gone ahead
and called out that they have a better
socket for the CPU as well as for memory
and the PCI Express slots they've also
implemented a very high current eight
pin plus four pin design this is only
going to be relevant if you're the kind
of person who is even capable of using a
board like this to its maximum potential
and speaking of using the board to its
maximum potential you have the option to
either use air cooling or liquid cooling
so the vrm cooler is using a hybrid
design so you can turn on this fan which
gigabyte claims is silent but I'm gonna
go ahead and call them on that one
because small fans are never silent or
you can disable it completely or just
take it off this is what I would
probably do and use the 3/8 inch
integrated barbs to liquid cool the vrm
which would be very very sweet around
the CPU socket we find the vrm design
which is extremely beefy on this board
using all international rectifier brand
components for the PWM as well as the
ICS although most of that is hidden by
the cooling solution here you can also
see that whether it's here around the
CPU socket or in other parts of the
board is using all what gigabyte is
calling their durable black solid caps
so it's all kind of part of the overall
ultra durable branding that gigabyte has
which refers to their 2 ounce copper PCB
their glass fabric PCB design that
improves humidity resistance
as well as generally the use of better
quality components which is useful not
only from a better performance
perspective because if you guys saw our
recent video comparing a
high-performance ATX board to an ITX
board performance wise there might not
be that much of a difference but there
can be a longevity difference in a
stability difference when we're talking
about pushing things to the absolute
limit I mean the board must have every
possible on board button reset power
OneTouch overclocking with the turbo
button the tag button recalls a favorite
setting that you set up within the BIOS
the ignition button I can't even
remember what that one does is allows
you to jump allows you to keep the power
on to the motherboard even once it is
turned off so there are a variety of
reasons overclockers might want to do
this particularly not wanting the
components to get too cold and have
condensation form in an out-of-control
fashion you've also got m base clock up
and down as well as multiplier up and
down and a gear button that changes the
ratios of up and down miss for the other
functionality and finally the Facebook
button which allows you to fire up
Facebook and tell your other social
media followers all about your
overclocking x-points no that's not
actually what this does that is the
trigger button which allows you to set
up your benchmarking run you're ready to
go boom boom boom okay at a nice low
stable frequency flip the button boom
you're running at your extreme frequency
then once your benchmark run is done
flip it back and now it's stable enough
to submit your scores and all that
you've got all of your voltage check
points whether it's 4 v core video of
the etc etc etc as well as an onboard
post debug LED the 24 pin connectors
it's an ideal location along the
right-hand edge and the front USB 3
connectors and it's almost ideal
location on the right-hand edge but not
in a right angle configuration this is
cool right here these are PCI Express
switches that allow you to actually turn
on and off different PCI Express laws
these can be great for diagnosing issues
whether you're on an open test bench and
there's the doorbell or whether you are
just have something like a complex water
cooling setup on your board and you're
trying to figure out what's going wrong
and it's a lot easier to turn off a PCI
Express slot than it is to pull a
graphics card also related to the PCI
Express slots is this extra
Ares SATA connector if you're installing
more than two graphics cards plug a SATA
connector in there and it'll give you a
little bit extra power for those cards
in those slots we've got six SATA three
six gigabit per second ports powered by
the Intel controller and then four more
powered by Marvell controller then
finally we've got a CMOS clear switch
down here on the bottom right and more
fan headers we'll cover those later
front panel connectors for if you are
installing this board in an actual case
another front USB 3 header 2 front USB 2
headers a comm port of all things and
front panel audio although there isn't a
particularly high end audio
implementation on this board unlike the
more gaming optimized board from their
g1 series so this is really overclocking
optimized not necessarily gaming
optimized now I want to point out where
all the fan connectors are on this board
so we've got two up here on the top not
a whole lot down the right-hand edge so
there's basically just one here so
that's three total now and boom high
concentration on the bottom two more
four five one more four six another two
four eight and finally the ninth one is
over here at the back which is great if
you have a rear 120 millimeter fan that
you want to install it on the PCI
Express configuration is very very ample
so gigabyte is using a switching
solution in order to achieve 4x or
rather 8 X 8 X 8 X 8 X bandwidth
required for 4-way crossfire or four-way
SLI configurations so you can put pretty
much whatever graphics cards you could
possibly want on this particular board
once we get around to the rear i/o we
find 2 USB to ports 2 HDMI ports
DisplayPort a ps2 keyboard mouse combo
port 6 USB 3.0 ports optical audio out 2
Gigabit Ethernet ports and 7.1 audio out
although most overclockers probably
won't even care about the audio out I
think I missed the memory support so of
course it supports dual channel ddr3
memory up to 8 gig dims at this point in
time and pretty much any speed you could
possibly see fit to put in it remember
though the maximum speed achievable
particularly on the Haswell platform is
going to be determined by your CPUs
integrated memory controller as well as
the frequency
pushing for on your cpu because the
higher that frequency goes the lower
your max memory overclock will be unless
you happen to be particularly talented
thank you for checking out this unboxing
and overview of the z87 XOC force from
gigabyte I think I actually missed one
very important thing here and that is
the dedicated switch to go between the
two biases on this board so if you do
happen to brick something or it just
sort of the power goes out in the middle
of a flash you will be able to recover
it like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
