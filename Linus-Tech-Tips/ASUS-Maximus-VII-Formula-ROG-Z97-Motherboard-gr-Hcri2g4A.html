motherboard the Maximus 7 formula has
all the bells in it
wait what sorry it's not supposed to
come with any bells or whistles this is
a piece of computer hardware not a
summer camp counselor preparedness kit
Coolermaster v-series semi modular power
supplies feature 80 plus gold efficiency
and their gold guarantee five-year
warranty click now to learn more
obviously
I meant figurative bells and whistles
with CPU performance pretty much equal
across every motherboard running a given
chipset a Seuss's approach to justifying
the high price of a formula grade
Republic of gamers board is to load it
chock full of features that they hope
will enrich the gaming experience let's
find out if they succeeded first a
physical tour it starts with the
eye-catching plastic ROG armor plate on
the front of the board an attractive if
not particularly functional feature and
a steel backplate something that may
actually save you a motherboard RMA if
you have a tendency to accidentally
scratch the backs of your boards on
motherboard standoffs the LGA 1150
socket is powered by an 8 + 4 pin
connector setup although you only really
need to plug in one of them and thanks
to the new improved digi+ eight phase
power design it performs optimally with
any Intel CPU that fits in it ran is a
similar story with digital power
delivery and support for up to 33
hundred megahertz ddr3 RAM in dual
channel we're talking ddr4 type range
speed here on board Tweaker friendly
dials include on-board power reset memo
KK bot and sound stage buttons more on
those last two later and finally to go
along with a header for their external
overclocking panel there are built-in
voltage check points although I prefer
the implementations of some other
manufacturers who include multimeter
friendly adapters instead of relying on
my steady hands to get a reading moving
further down the storage configure this
board is super premium in some ways with
dual SATA Express slots one from the
Intel chipset and a second
Media powered one each of which can
become 2 SATA 3 slots for a total of 10
and yet kind of lacking in others with
no rear eSATA and while it has an MDOT 2
slot on the M PCIe combo 3 thing that
comes pre-loaded with a Bluetooth and
dual band AC wireless card the
aforementioned m dot 2 only works with
short style drives due to clearance
issues with the ROG Armour maybe that's
why I soos also sent over their hyper n
dot 2x4 expansion card that just plugs
into a PCI Express slot something that's
an extra for this board it's not
something that I'm likely to use soon
with M got two drives not being that
plentiful and not really offering a
tangible performance benefit yet but
they also have other expansion options
available such as their Thunderbolt 2
module that works on all of their z97
boards including this one with love to
get my hands on one of those PCI Express
gen3 expansion is handled by three PCIe
1x slots 2 PCIe 16x slots that are split
to 8 X 8 X from both are in use and a
final PCIe 4x slot that can be used for
a graphics card and 3-way crossfire but
unfortunately isn't usable for 3-way SLI
now 3-way graphics configurations are
not something that I really encourage
anyway but I feel like for someone
dropping almost $400 on a motherboard
these days it should probably at least
be an option anyway under these slots is
a Seuss's best onboard audio
implementation yet high-quality Dax and
premium audio grade capacitors aren't
exactly new but what is new with the
2014 edition of their supreme effects
audio solution is the ability to amplify
your games and music can provide a great
listening experience no matter where you
plug into which with the number of
people using front panel audio
connectors is a great step forward now
let's take a quick look at the rear
panel with its useful clear CMOS button
abundance of USB 3 ports and some people
won't care about this but I do ps2 port
before moving on to the features and
extras that Asus feels will help this
product justify its high price compared
to the more basic options that are also
available for DIY PC builders first up
is the best onboard fan control setup
I've yet seen on a motherboard it's got
eight sensibly positioned fan headers
with what has become standard on Asus
boards individual control of either PWM
or DC fans via curves that can be
adjusted according to onboard or
manually position temp sensors awesome
next up is key bought an onboard chip
that sits electrically between your USB
port and your keyboard and allows you to
remap your f keys to other keys macros
functions like media playback or program
shortcuts the UI
isn't particularly intuitive but once
you set it up it actually seems to work
pretty well when you toggle it on and
off with this can be done in software or
with an onboard button for some reason
there's a bit of a delay longer the
first time but nothing horrible it
actually works on to sound features
manner there are a lot of these first is
their sonic radar which puts a visual
representation of where noises are
coming from on the screen it lets you
adjust opacity and turn it on or off for
different games with profiles next
they've got their soundstage Hardware
level EQ presets they only work on the
front panel audio and if you live in
bizarre universe you can press an
onboard button to toggle them and use
the post LED to see if you're in fps or
sports mode or whatever or if you're a
normal person you can change them in the
control panel where you'll actually find
a lot more stuff that I don't really use
like artificial reverb effects smart EQ
and Virtual Surround
the good news is that within the panel
there's also a ton of useful stuff like
a software EQ DTS settings and their
voice clarity feature to make in-game
communications pop a little bit more and
be easier to hear in summary the
hardware of the audio on this board is
great I mean it even auto detects the
impedance of your headphones when you
plug them in and adjusts the output
accordingly
but there are some dials in the software
that many purists would never touch
thankfully they have a test feature so
you can do a be listening to see what
sounds best for you I really wish they'd
add a few more different sample audio
tracks so that would make it a little
bit more useful on to gain first
networking the features in here are
really cool and for a long time I
actually had a killer NIC k1 installed
in my personal system just to be able to
Peter bandwidth or prioritize traffic
between applications so this being
powered by an Intel chipset instead of a
Bigfoot one should be much better but
I've had a fair bit of trouble with
network connections working correctly
with AI sweet and game first installed
over the years and unfortunately this
time around is no exception with my
network connection sometimes taking five
to even 15 minutes to start working
correctly whenever I unplug it the
saving grace is that once it is running
it works like awesome though so your
mileage may vary let me know in the
comments how game first is working for
you if you have an Isuzu motherboard and
finally we've got their cross chill
copper air / water vrm cooler and with
this I think they finally nailed it
mostly like last gen it's got G 1/4
thread so I can use my own fittings but
this time we get copper internals so I'm
not mixing any metals in my loop way to
go a sous the only issue left is making
sure that there's enough clearance for
large compressions for the people who
like those but my preferred 3/8 inch
thick wall ones fit just fine so this is
a total non-issue for me - thumbs up in
the real world with the 4770k switching
from air to water let me go from 66
degrees to 56 degrees on the vrm Center
and a I sweet but I feel like that
sensor isn't really positioned to be
truly representative of the difference
because the board feels much more cooler
than that to the touch which leads us to
conclusion time is the Maximus 7 formula
a luxury item or is it a practical
purchase I mean you do get some software
extras like Kaspersky antivirus daemon
tools Pro and a full copy of watchdogs
yes it's better built and looks a lot
nicer than the other stuff and you do
get those little ROG extras like
additional support over the longer term
but while I do see more value in a
high-end board these days now that
generational cpu performance
improvements from Intel are so small
that you're likely to get a few
generations out of it I also think the
same could be said about a Seuss's z97
pro which is available for a little over
half the price so the bottom line is yes
it's a luxury item but at least it's a
cool one guys like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you
like it leave a comment letting me know
if you have any suggestions for future
videos or comments that are more
complicated than liking or disliking or
whatever else check out the link in the
video description to support us you can
give us a monthly contribution buy a
sweet t-shirt like this one or change
