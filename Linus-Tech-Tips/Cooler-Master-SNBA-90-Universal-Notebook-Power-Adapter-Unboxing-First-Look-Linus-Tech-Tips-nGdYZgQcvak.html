coolermaster USN a 95 now I'm going to
go out on a limb and I'm gonna guess
that that means ultra slim notebook
adapter 95 watts now it's capable of a
peak of up to a hundred and fifty watts
but the sustained output for this slim
notebook adapter is 95 watts so what
that means is you can power most of the
notebooks out on the market that aren't
using like powerful dedicated graphics
cards so anything with an onboard
graphics card shouldn't be that much of
a problem just gonna go ahead and break
the seal here get this unboxed wow this
is like a complicated top to this box
look at this there's like layers to the
paper and folds and like okay so let's
go ahead and take the product out so
I've note is the fact that it features a
it has a slim design for easy storage
and portability this is key this is
awesome so you can see how slim it is
I'm gonna compare it to the iPhone 4
because it's actually quite similar in
size so you could there you keep it in
your pocket if you really wanted to
there you go alright so what this means
is that you can easily fit it into a
laptop briefcase for example without any
bulging on the side or without putting
unnecessary pressure on the key on the
lid of your laptop so that it pushes
into the keyboard leaving marks on the
screen so that is a scenario I can think
of where this would be a good thing
slim design okay so we've got the little
velcro guy right here that helps us
manage this particular cable you can see
the length here so this is a little less
than a Linus arms been up to about here
about that long alright so that plugs
into this side there we are and then
we've got our Universal well as
universal as anyone can make them
because nobody seems to be able to just
agree on a standard for a No
power adapters so this goes in here and
then we've got nine charger tips so
let's see what they have to say for
themselves about these chargers if so
the orange one down here it's good for
Acer Asus HP compaq Ben Q and then we
got Acer Asus HP for cotton pack IBM
Lenovo a sources HP compaq Toshiba
Fujitsu gateway NEC acer is compact Sony
Dell HP oh wait no Dell HP Compaq IBM
Lenovo and Samsung so that's what all of
these are for so you can see a sir is
the one the least decisive one as far as
picking a standard anyway you've got a
variety of different tips that will help
you to plug it into your notebook it
also comes with a little carrying punch
look at that has a little drawstring
line it could also keep like an apple in
there if you wanted to take it to lunch
like a hobo satchel okay not quite like
a homosexual
okay cable management things so they've
got a little clip here this is
apparently for cable management I fail
to see how that helps with cable
management hold on there's got to be
something I'm missing here
so this clipped to something and then
the cable goes in here or something give
me a minute so this is camera man's
theory for how this works but I don't I
don't buy it I just yeah if you guys
have any brilliant ideas for how this
works let me know
oh wait here's something hold on hold on
I'll have an idea maybe this goes in
here no I just don't get it okay so
here's the picture they show so it just
has like a cable in there and great
cable management I don't get it
okay this is cool though check this out
so you've got a USB charger here so what
that means is that you can plug in your
USB device like your iPhone or your
Android phone without actually even
having your notebook powered on so that
right there is a reason to upgrade your
existing power adapter to the slim one
because it's easier to carry with you
and it includes the USB charger by
default
okay you've also got this neat little
stand that holds all of your different
adaptable
and I'll show you guys how easy it is
just swap the tips it's that easy
there we go now it's on let's see how
easy it is to take off it's that easy so
you can see it's keyed so it only goes
in one way there's a flat side just put
that in like that boom now you're ready
