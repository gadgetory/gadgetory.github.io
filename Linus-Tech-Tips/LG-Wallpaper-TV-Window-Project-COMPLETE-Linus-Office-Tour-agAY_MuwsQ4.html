wallpaper TV window saga is here I've
come up with a couple of really fun ways
to take advantage of the features we saw
in our previous videos including its 4k
resolution spectacular image quality
integrated Dolby sound bar and HDR
support and I'm rolling the whole thing
into something people have been asking
about for quite some time so step into
my office we are going for a little tour
sponsored by LG almost everything in
here has a story behind it the textured
wall on the left as you come in is not
wallpaper which is what most people
assume it's actually made up entirely of
painted motherboards and it's not just
for looks
see you can hang stuff off the little
i/o ports as for my desk that hasn't
changed much the custom PC that was
built into it was designed to my spec
with a 10 Core Extreme Edition processor
a 1.2 terabyte Intel PCI Express SSD and
Asus workstation board with 10 gigabit
networking 64 gigs of corsair dominator
special edition memory 24 terabytes of
local storage a totally overkill water
cooling system from UK and an LG 38 you
c99 38 inch 75 Hertz ultrawide monitor
with a c910 webcam and a razer siren pro
for video calls and some pretty boring
peripherals they're actually so old
they're not even they're not even
Argentine
I'm using a Corsair Raptor m45 because
it's one of the only mice that doesn't
agitate my wrists and as for my g7
10-plus honestly nothing else would feel
quite right this baby has seen me
through literally hundreds of thousands
of words of LTT script material
including the ones you're listening to
right now and I have no intention of
replacing it until it fails this wall
here is where I keep all the sentimental
stuff that I have acquired over the
years I've got the world's creepiest
renditions of Han Solo and Leia Organa
with mine and my wife's head swapped
onto them a broken thread ripper 1950
xcp you framed badminton jersey an
entire silicon wafer of quantum
processors that was really cool that was
from when we checked out d-wave and
finally one of those Chinese money cats
that my wife got me as sort of a joke
when we moved into this building and
then he's wearing this super weird thing
that this JaVale Oh company sent they
were like whoa check it out you could do
engraved pendants with your face on it
and I was like wow who would want to do
that bringing us finally to the big
change now the original plan here for
the wallpaper TV window was to just
basically leave the room the way that it
was and put the TV on the wall but as
you can see we actually ended up
Rikka jiggering this entire side of the
room to make it significantly more
functional so we added some shelving up
on the top left I can use that to store
ongoing projects or things like the
extra modular cables for my test bench
power supply we added some shelves over
on the right which ended up being mostly
decorative they're not really big enough
to put anything that useful on and we
added this built in desk so it's the
right height for me as it is which means
I no longer need to have one of our more
expensive up desks in here we've got a
pass-through power that's backed up by a
UPS as well as pass-through USB power
for whatever I might be running on the
bench surface right here
and use case number one for the
wallpaper TV is that better not that
does so right now I'm testing this
external GPU box and there you go I'm
just using it as a secondary display for
the laptop right here so I've got two
HDMI cables that are coming up through
the bottom of the desk one of them comes
up through here for a test bench and the
other one comes up over here for a
laptop so I can just sit here and use
these throw a video up there if I want
to have it playing in the background
while I'm working or whatever the case
may be use case number two is probably
the most obvious one so using an
additional PC just a little low power
consumption one plugged into yet another
HDMI input in the speaker bar that's
below the desk here we can use a
combination of stock video footage from
online and our own clips like the one
that's running behind me to change the
environment in the room more than you
would probably think so whether it's the
Serengeti or whether it's a view out
over the water in downtown Vancouver or
from in a bad mood whatever goes better
with that this use case is probably the
most wow factor one for when people come
into the room because the image quality
on this thing is just breathtaking which
isn't to say that it's necessarily the
one that's most fun for me okay so let's
pull this off and check this out wait
this was just working this right here is
the new tech studio monitor app and with
this I can replace the functionality of
the fifty dollar piece of glass that I
could have put here with exactly the
same experience for the value price of
only eight thousand dollars for the TV
plus a whole bunch of other gear
yes my friends I can see exactly what I
would have seen if we had just put a
window here or thanks to the wonders of
modern battery banks with AC outputs
networking and I don't know tripods I
can see anything I want anywhere with a
network connection this thing actually
does go wireless but I found that the
wired connection is a little more
reliable go figure right I just got the
battery out of the camera is that good
oh that's not good
don't mind me employees I am just
putting this camera here pay no
attention to the camera it will not be
used for surveillance don't think of it
as a camera think of it as a window of
opportunity check it out
they don't suspect a thing my totally
discreet tripod setup gives me a window
into the goings-on of the lmg
headquarters neat huh well whatever I
like it so thanks to LG for sponsoring
this project thanks to you guys for
patiently waiting for all the parts to
