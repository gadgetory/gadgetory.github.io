battlefield 3 benchmarking which I know
I'm a little bit late on at this point
but it is what it is these things take
time I'm also working on my water-cooled
system guide all that good stuff but
yeah I have a message from the crazy
Russian right now that he insists I tell
you guys right away
so remember crazy Russian is our NCIX PC
wizard and he has also been working on a
bit of a side project here which is an
NCI X sponsor in battlefield 3 server or
for actually for servers so if there are
4 servers which are kind of spread out
in the US or I should say North America
because some of them are pretty close to
the Canadian border including one in
Seattle where they're using the premium
bandwidth plan to get the ultimate low
pings even if you have up to 64 players
on it so we've got a 14 millisecond ping
to that server from Vancouver so that is
outstanding and so there's two 64 player
servers a 32 player server and an 8
player server there's also a platoon
rather there's two platoons so you can
check out here if you just search for
NCIX
this is the official one the gaming
lounge and then this is a fan created
one so yeah you guys should definitely
come check it out I'm gonna try and find
some time to play on one of those
servers on the weekend probably the
official NCIX one given I'm an official
MCI X person and I think that's pretty
much all there is to say about it we
hope to see you guys on our server
something to note you guys is we do have
someone actively monitoring the servers
he actually has an app for his iPhone so
we can kick hackers no matter where he
is or what time of day it is he's a
really good guy and he's very dedicated
to it so yeah if you guys are sort of
concerned that yeah great server great
ping except it's not being admitted well
yes it is so yeah I look forward to
seeing you guys there and I'll be on
there as a probably either probably
closeted game or Linus depends on how
how its configured in this game I
haven't actually tried multiplayer yet
so expect me to have all the noob
weapons and everything like that but
thank you for checking out this little
NCIX announcement about our battlefield
3 server and frag on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
