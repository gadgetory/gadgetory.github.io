recent video introducing AMD's thread
ripper 229 90 WX cpu about the overlay
on the bottom right corner of my screen
prompting me to activate Windows now
some of you were amused and some of you
were upset but you all had one thing in
common you couldn't imagine why an
organization like Linus Media Group one
with sponsors like cable Mod whose
configurator now includes a customizable
RGB backplate option that can enhance
the look of your GPUs and SSDs it's
compatible of our sink RGB fusion mystic
light sync and cable mods own RGB kits
and you can find out at the link below
why an organization like linus media
group with sponsors like that would need
to save a hundred bucks here and there
on a legit copy of Windows well why
don't we talk about that
so let's begin by grabbing a Windows
license out of the pile preferably one
that isn't in use by Dennis so by the
way I got these at NCIX so I clearly
didn't just run out and buy them for the
purpose of making this video so this
would be the official procedure for
installing Windows on a PC in this case
it's my personal test bench the one that
I usually have in my office here now I'm
basically going to be burning this
license for the purpose of creating this
video which kind of sucks cuz it's
actually a so Windows 10 Pro license but
it's important for me to demonstrate my
point here to show you guys actually
activating Windows and how that might
work on the test bench and hey there we
go activation Windows 10 Pro Windows is
activated with a digital license now
let's say that I was working on
something like a video card review so
typically what we do in those cases is
we get our pile of graphics cards ready
here then after we've run our benchmarks
on one card we shut down the system and
swap out to a new one there's only one
small problem with that Microsoft's
activation servers create a unique
identifier for your PC based on the
hardware that's installed in it so you
can see we actually survived one graphic
card swap here but if too many things
changed let's say you keep swapping
graphics cards you want to see how the
system runs with half as much memory you
change out the CPU or worst of all you
need to change out the motherboard
either to try a different platform or as
a troubleshooting measure what can
happen is that identifiers can change
and I don't fully understand exactly how
it determines when it changes but if it
does it can prompt Windows to deactivate
so we had checked this before we started
and it wasn't activated yet so that's
that's pretty funny because on this one
I had even gone as far as to swap out
the boot drive I was using but it
still managed to grab something about
the hardware ID and managed to migrate
the license but the point is that at
some point you will get that prompt back
now in the olden days and I guess this
was probably about seven eight years ago
the solution to getting an activation
prompt was to call up microsoft's
activation hotline try the automated
reactivation process have that error out
twice so this is like a ten-minute
project then press a button to be put
through to a representative explain that
you had changed out some of your
hardware and you needed a reset on your
license but this was time-consuming and
it wasn't even a sure thing
I actually remember getting into a
fairly heated argument with a rep who
was telling me that I had run out of
reactivations and for my use case which
is swapping Hardware out all the time in
order to test it I had to just buy a new
license every time I got prompted with
that activate Windows watermark and I
mean she said there was nothing she
could do and then at some point I was it
was a pretty awkward conversation but
but but my point is even if she was
right
according to Microsoft's terms for the
license I'm also right - I can't be
expected to run out and buy a new
license for Windows every time there's
some new hardware launch and I've got to
do something with my test bench
fortunately around that time I got a
subscription to tech net a software
subscription service that allowed you to
use pretty much any Microsoft software
in a non-commercial environment with
unlimited activations now that actually
worked great for me even though
technically my use was commercial since
it was a for-profit endeavor that I was
doing this testing at least it was great
until they shut down tech net in 2013
now the new legit way to transfer your
license is the activation troubleshooter
so you can see what I've done now is I
just linked my digital license to a
micro
to count so I've never done this before
but theoretically what happens here is
we should be able to even swap the drive
and go into that settings menu and
migrate the license to another computer
on our own which is pretty cool and a
lot better than the old system so let's
give that a shot shall we so we're not
gonna get to show you guys exactly how
it works because the Microsoft
activation servers work in mysterious
ways but overall it sounds pretty
painless there's supposed to be a prompt
transferring your license blah blah blah
blah etc something along yep they don't
have any screenshots either anyway
eventually no matter how you're moving
your license around their terms do state
that you will run out of activations at
some point but with that said through
this method and then you know maybe some
of those cheap $20 windows keys that you
can get from grey market sources online
there should be no justification then
for having that activate Windows
watermark right like we should just we
should just bite the bullet and go
through this process except for one
problem
those $20 keys that you buy online are
not intended for the North American or
the European market and they are
therefore not actually legit so if
having the watermark removed from your
system is where you draw the line and
that's what helps you sleep at night
then that's great but the thing about
software is that the license terms are
defined by the EULA that they read this
first stuff not by whether a key
activates or doesn't activate with
Microsoft's servers for example the
Windows 10 VM that I have set up for
remote access for one of our off-site
workers is technically against
Microsoft's license terms yeah I
actually found that out just yesterday
while I was prepping this video regular
Windows 10 is technically not allowed to
be used exclusively for remote access
the more you know write in much the same
way if you've got a buddy who's got a
volume license agreement or a site key
that's not legit either it'll activate
for you and it'll get rid of the
watermark but that is still software
piracy so at the end of the day there
are inexpensive and even free ways for
us to make sure that that watermark
never shows up in one of our videos
again but they involve either gray
market software or violation of the
license terms anyway so for a use case
that's unsupported anyhow our whole
thing where we're using test benches to
validate Hardware the best solution that
we've actually found is just to leave
the software unactivated forever so
here's the regular installer and you
might not have ever noticed this before
but Microsoft actually has a built-in
way to run Windows for testing purposes
so check out this button here depending
on the version of Windows the amount of
time that you're allowed differs but if
all we do is click skip instead of
entering a product key the Windows
installation will proceed exactly the
way that it normally would
we still get Windows updates performance
of our hardware isn't impacted
whatsoever we don't have to waste time
tooling around with any activation
nonsense and for my part
honestly I sleep just fine at night
knowing that my pile of windows keys
downstairs more than covers the test
benches that we have deployed so if you
ever see our activation watermark in one
of our videos again you will understand
why I'm just avoiding some paperwork it
has nothing to do with saving a buck on
Windows 10 speaking of saving a buck
anchors upcoming sound core flare plus
he's not gonna help you so it's not
gonna help you save a buck because you
might want to buy it it's a wireless
speaker that allows you to amplify the
atmosphere with their 360 degrees sounds
so there should be no concerns about
positioning you've got the ability to
pair two of these speakers for stereo
sound and they're beat-driven lightshow
will sync
to your music it's got ipx7 protection
that keeps it pool party approved and it
can effortlessly withstand spills rain
and even complete submersion in water
the large capacity battery will keep
your music playing for up to 20 hours
and it can even help charge your device
at the same time so check out the link
below to learn more about the speaker
and get a chance to win one so thanks
for watching guys if you dislike this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff we featured at the link in the
video description sure go buy Windows 10
while you're down there you can check
