guys welcome to the zotac booth back at
CES you saw us cover a whole bunch of
different Z boxes but this time they
have a Z box steam box this is the SN
970 and as its namesake might give away
it has a GTX 970 under the hood along
with a skylake quad-core processor 8
gigabytes of RAM a 64 gigabyte SSD and a
one terabyte hard drive in terms of
input/output you have 4 HDMI in our 4
HDMI out sorry and 1 HDMI IN if you want
to stream into the machine and it also
has dual gigabit ethernet 8:02 point 11
AC Wi-Fi along with bluetooth for gate 4
USB 3.0 ports two USB 2.0 ports and a
card reader along with a mic in and
stereo out along with the beautiful
white and black aesthetic with the shiny
Steam logo on the top and the cool white
LED shining power button on the front
which you may not be able to see in this
footage it looks really great overall
and is probably in my opinion one of the
better steam boxes that I've seen so far
what do you guys think let me know in
the comments down below but as its
namesake and as the giant logo on top of
its a it is very obviously a steam box
whether or not you like that it doesn't
really matter steam OS is free you can
use steam OS if you want you can use
that Bluetooth connectivity to manage
your music library through Steam music
you can use the HDMI IN to stream things
to your steam box or whatever the heck
you want or you can just install windows
over top of it doesn't really matter
it's coming as a free installed OS
