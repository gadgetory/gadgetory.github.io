- both ran sony's own proprietary
platform which while cool and all left
some people wanting more the Sony
SmartWatch 3 introduces a ton of new
features and now sports Android wear
stay tuned to check out those features
out and slam the like button down below
if you want to see review on the Nvidia
shield which is apparently a console
this time around
Kingston kc3 10 series SSDs feature
firmware based power loss protection
massive capacities up to 960 gigabytes
and business grade reliability click now
to learn more the Sony SmartWatch 3 is
running a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core arm
cortex a7 processor with 512 megabytes
of RAM and 4 gigabytes of permanent
storage which when all put together is
considerably more powerful than my first
computer kind of an interesting thought
it also sports a 1.6 inch transflective
display at 320 by 320 pixels ambient
light sensors an accelerometer a compass
a gyro a radio GPS and those are all
powered by a hashtag 420 milliamp power
battery which states about two days of
normal use and I would agree with that
spec after I've been using it for about
three weeks it's relatively light
weighing in at about 66 grams when
equipped with one of its standard kind
of rubbery silicon bands the band itself
comes in pink yellow white or black
silicon brown or black leather or steel
when looking at their website but please
note that any other options other than
silicon will come at a hefty price
premium also for reference a replacement
silicon band cost about 50 bucks which
while expensive isn't too surprising for
a fashion piece more on the band
the silicon feels nice on the skin the
band doesn't have a huge series of links
like a metal band does so it doesn't
pull your hair oh the easy to use
adjustment system makes it very easy to
change the sizing on the fly and the
snap clasp is very easy to put on and
take off at any time unfortunately
sometimes a little bit too easy when
walking around I tend to get the metal
bit of the clasp caught on my pocket
which results in the watch coming undone
but honestly I can't complain too much
personally because after a while I kind
of found it a little fun it started
doing it on purpose just something to
note if you're someone who might be a
little annoyed by this my other three
gripes about the band were one that the
overlapping silicon on the band and the
metal clasp mechanism on the bottom of
the wrist added a bunch of bulk made it
rather annoying for my wrist if I was
doing something like say typing on a
table to that this particular silicon
material seems to pick up a lot of dust
and lint
which results in it losing its
attractiveness rather quickly and three
due to the way that the band holds the
watch face so it can be super easy to
pop out
you can't swap the band for a standard
22 millimeter strap like you can on
something like the LG G watch R which
essentially means that you don't really
have any options outside of buying
whatever Sony decides to offer you at
it's fairly unlikely that a third party
guys are really going to make any band
specifically for this watch the
SmartWatch 3 definitely it has the
sporty style aesthetic thing going on it
may not look as classy and sharp as the
Moto 360 but it suits most categories of
casual dress if you're still worried
about this you should know that the band
swaps out incredibly quickly and you
could easily have one for the gym and
one for the office or whatever setup you
want there isn't any fancy power dock or
wireless charging system for this guy
but I don't really mind that it's a
little weird to plug it in with the band
on but you just pop the watch face out
out like I was talking about earlier and
remove the small silicon protector and
it's quite easy to plug in and allows
you to avoid the hassle of hauling extra
stuff around just in case your watch
dies or being out of a watch for who
knows how long because your charging
dock died like what happened to Linus
also please note that the silicon
protector for the micro USB plug isn't
just there for your comfort
this watch steps it up a notch over most
of the other smartwatches with an IP 68
water and dust resistance rating meaning
it can withstand submersion of up to
four point nine feet of water for 30
minutes compared to the more common ip67
rating which is three point two eight
feet underwater for thirty minutes yeah
again no real diving but it might add
some survivability to the watch in
general use case situations the general
Android wear software coverage you can
check out Linus's moto 360 review here
but if you're looking into a SmartWatch
please know that it's more there mainly
for simplification of things that you
already do I mean I mainly just use mine
to reduce the amount of times I have to
pull my phone out of my pocket in
general to do things like music control
or receive notifications you also have
some Google now options like texting
people and search and navigation with
some other things like reminders and the
weather
but the SmartWatch 3 does bring some
unique things to the table these unique
features are mostly focused on being
able to do things without your
smartphone like listen to music from the
watch or GPS track you're running roads
using something like ghost racer these
features may be gold for some people but
they're not that useful for me if I'm
going to go out I'm going to have my
phone with me because I need to be able
to be easily contacted kind of all the
time and I have pockets and all my
shorts I would also have appreciated a
heart rate sensor the watch has a nice
sporty design and a GPS for the casual
runners out there but for like hard
cores that want more data available to
them a heart rate sensor can help a lot
for fitness this thing still leaves me
wanting a proper fitness tracker like a
Fitbit and I would really like to see
the two worlds of fitness trackers and
Android wear collide in the near future
even though that may be a lot to ask in
conclusion the SmartWatch game is still
a battle of trade-offs you have the
fitness camp and the Android wear camp
both going hard with their various pros
and cons then you have the awkward Apple
watch kind of sitting in the corner
selling a ton of units for whatever
reason the Sony SmartWatch 3 brings the
ability to do some things like serious
running and listening to music without
needing your phone in proximity and it
does it as a really nice USD price of
$175 on what seems to be a consistent
sale on Amazon which is amazing or the
less nice price of $400 on the Canadian
Amazon so final Mouse is a pretty new
entrant into the peripheral market
they're putting a lot of their emphasis
on eSports and gaming and this is the
final Mouse it's got a picsArt 3310 ir
LED sensor with 0 acceleration 0
prediction no angle snapping and high
tracking speeds it doesn't even have
drivers you just drop it in and select
between the preset dpi levels and you're
pretty much ready to go
it features an extremely light shell and
Omron switches and basically has been
the Mouse of choice for Edie here in the
office for quite some time but how can
you get one well we're actually running
a giveaway for these three final Mouse
