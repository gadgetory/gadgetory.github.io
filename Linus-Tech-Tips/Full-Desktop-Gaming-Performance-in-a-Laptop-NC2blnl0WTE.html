thing as many of you know my daily
driver is a razorblade 14 but it's not
like I haven't noticed that as marvelous
as a thin and light with a gtx 970m
still is it thermal throttles it's loud
and it still falls short of the true
performance of a desktop computer
something that many people desire in a
mobile system so it is for those people
and the ones who just like over-the-top
tech that I say stay tuned because the
Sega NP 98 70 u2g is the fastest laptop
I have ever laid my hands on
Corsairs are my series power supplies
feature premium components for great
performance with very low noise check
out the link in the video description to
learn more let's start with a look at
the outside of this beast of a machine
on the top of the shell is a chromed
plastic Sager logo and some software
customizable lighting accents on the
bottom is wow that is a lot of
ventilation holes there's one spot over
here for the subwoofer but most of the
rest of the bottom of the unit and even
some of the front is mesh kinda like my
Halloween costume that one year I oh I
would describe as very good with dual
killer II 2400 Gigabit LAN ports three
USB 3.0 ports and dedicated headphone
mic optical and line out audio jacks on
the left SD more USB 3.0 Thunderbolt 3
with a type-c connector oh yeah and a
couple mini display ports on the right
and finally HDMI and yet another USB 3.0
port on the back opening her up we find
pretty much what we'd expect on a large
all the bells and whistles gaming laptop
the wrist rest and keyboard area are
plastic but actually very sturdy the
upward firing speakers are loud and
actually sound pretty darn good and
while I wish the touchpad was a little
closer to the front edge the included
fingerprint scanner is a nice touch and
it tracks really well
finally the keyboard with its software
customisable RGB backlighting and macro
functionality gets a solid B there's a
bit more keycap wobble than I'd
personally like and the travel action is
a little mushy but it didn't affect my
typing speed and it's very very quiet
which brings us to the screen what can I
say is nice this is a 17-inch 60 Hertz
IPS panel with Nvidia g-sync technology
for antara free gaming experience and
with a couple minutes of tinkering I had
it running at a hundred Hertz on this
sampling unit that sager sent to me
though your mileage may vary but if I'm
going to say something outlandish like
this is the most powerful laptop I've
ever laid my hands on then I'd better be
backing it up so let's crack her open
and find out what treasures be inside
first things first
that is a desktop
J 11:50 Woonsocket hidden away under all
of those heat pipes and connected to one
of the three heat sink fin arrays at the
back of the laptop's chassis friends and
it is full of none other than a full
desktop core i7 6700 K skylake quad core
yep and the holy balls doesn't end there
prying up the keyboard reveals 216 gig
sticks of ddr4 memory giving this laptop
a maximum capacity of 64 gigs portable
workstation anyone and while I'm not a
huge fan of systems that are
pre-configured with the boot drives in
raid 0 that my friends is two of
Samsung's fancy-pants new 256 gig nvme
950 Pro drives that are tearing up the
benchmarks all over the internet all of
them I mean using this thing is
noticeably faster and more responsive
than even a standard SSD something that
made more sense to me when I finally ran
crystal disk mark and realized that it
was putting out sequential read and
write speeds of two or three gigabytes
per second holy actual flipping this
puppy over things get even better hiding
away in this corner are a couple of two
and a half inch hard drive slots that
you can use to either configure the
laptop with more storage directly from
Sega or upgrade later and yes finally
the centerpiece the desktop class gtx
980 eight gig that luke showed off back
at Nvidia's event has made its way
finally to us this is a really cool
unique piece of hardware first there's
the fact that it's a non-standard width
which precludes any possibility of
shipping an SLI configuration in this
chassis anyway even if Sager could
figure out some way to power and cool it
and second is something that's not as
obvious to the naked eye the fact that
it's really up to the individual
notebook manufacturers to determine how
to tune the GPU for performance they can
limit its power or allow it to thermal
throttle a scenario that will still
result in better performance than a
lesser GPU or they can throw six heat
pipes at it like Sega did in hopes
obtaining the Beast to the point where
it runs exactly the same as a desktop
card so I ran it
side against a desktop test bench with
the same hardware to see just how close
they got and while it might be
surprising to anyone who didn't see the
massive cooling solution inside this
puppy I wasn't exactly floored to see it
performed literally exactly the same as
my desktop which doesn't take anything
away from how impressive this kind of
performance is in what is certainly
larger and heavier than a MacBook Air
but still a portable device but there's
more to a laptop too than its sheer FPS
and I need to talk about the experience
as well in our standard Crysis 3 skybox
thermal test sitting on the table at
room temperature our 980 hummed along at
a mere 70 degrees while maintaining a
rock-solid boost clock of 12 28
megahertz I mean no wonder this machine
scores were so darn close to the desktop
ones and on top of that while the rear
exhaust vents are quite toasty the
keyboard and wrist rests stay cool with
the keyboard being the only part that's
barely noticeably warm to the touch
sounds like a dream right I wouldn't
know my ears are broken which is a
little unfair at least it's not the same
high-pitched fan noise of the blade 14
but this is no g7 51 either so if you
were expecting the NP 98 70 you to G to
be quiet when it's under a 3d workload
then you'd be a little bit disappointed
with your purchase but if you were
expecting a few hundred watts of thermal
dissipation to sound like a few hundred
watts of thermal dissipation and
adjusted your expectations accordingly
would you be happy with this laptop I
sure think so assuming you can afford it
as configured this machine costs well
over three thousand US dollars but even
if it's pricey what impresses me the
most is that it's possible at all it was
only a couple of years ago that my team
and I marveled at being able to take a
mini PC from shuttle with a core i7 39
60 X 16 gigs of RAM and a graphics card
with us to CES in a duffle bag with a 23
inch IPS monitor in someone's suitcase
so that we could edit our videos quickly
and in high
quality on the road and here we are a
mere few years later able to do the same
thing or better with a laptop holy crap
