hue this thing is relatively old so why
review it well it's still interesting
and I've got a bit of a twist that
you'll see if you stay tuned later on
also station scribe - tech tips for more
videos on unintended uses of products
of course rhx 1,200 eye power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet performance and corsair link
digital advanced monitoring and control
click now to learn more we're going to
start off tame and just do a physical
product overview it's a pretty simple
piece of hardware made out of plastic
for the most part with a bit of steel
meshing behind the fake Oh brushed
aluminum aluminium in front of this
meshing there are three knobs which are
respectively for brightness power and
mode these knobs also have individual
colors however which are red green and
blue respectively now I'll get into what
those knobs do in a moment but in the
back of this unit there's a SATA power
connector to run everything and a
connector for your single LED strip
which is nice and long but a little
disappointing on the LED density side
with each one being quite far away from
the others which isn't exactly ideal
okay but back to the knobs basically to
change how much of a corresponding color
should be shown twist the knobs to
perform whatever label the utility the
knob is for press it in for example
holding press on the power knob will
turn it off or on and pressing in the
mode knob will change the mode speaking
of modes there are five of them three
based on a custom color and two based on
color changing the first one is the most
basic it just emits your custom selected
color steadily and it is called custom
color display the second one is custom
color flashing and it well flashes your
custom color the third is custom color
fading which essentially gives your
custom color a breathing effect then we
get two flashing color changing which
will rotate these colors through while
flashing and last but not least is
fading color changing which will give a
breathing effect while changing colors
and yeah that's that's it in conclusion
the LED density bugs me I'm happy enough
with the available brightness modes but
my biggest gripe with this thing is that
it's a bae device now i don't blame it
it's from another time it's a little
aged now for how pc parts go but even a
lot of NZXT cases aren't compatible with
this as they don't have a
in a quarter-inch Bay anymore which
means it's adventure time all right so
the biggest problem with this is its
depth that makes it so you can't really
put it anywhere else in the computer so
the first thing that we're going to do
is just try to remove it from the actual
sled and see what we end up with home so
we take out a bunch of these screws
that's already a huge amount of useless
mass removed well we don't really need
these arms anymore we'll keep them for
sure we'll keep out all this stuff just
in case but with these arms it might
actually be easier to use them to mount
this thing on somewhere else inside the
other inside the case but they're
probably just going to get in the way so
for now I'm going to remove them now I'm
going to see how much this thing
actually needs the front plate you might
not really be a requirement all right
so front plate not really needed at all
you actually see all the knobs there
anyways everything still works you can
actually see here now that there's LEDs
on the controller board in pictures on
their website you can see through here
that LEDs are shiny but now you can
actually see what those LEDs are so this
now becomes way easier to put into a
case anywhere you want
now you have a much more versatile kind
of PCB which you can put pretty much
wherever you want if you decided to you
could leave that front plate on it I
kind of like the exposed PCB style but
that's obviously up to you in something
that's actually really really easy to do
so in actual conclusion go on ebay go on
Craigslist find a cheap one out there
he'll even maybe buy a new one maybe
replace the LED strip and BAM with a
screwdriver and some adhesive or of some
sorts you have yourself an easy way to
stand up from the crowd at a LAN are
there easier or other ways to do this
sure and maybe I'll do some maker style
videos on how to do it yourself in the
future
but for now this is easy as hell and it
works luckily NZXT went ahead and used
black wires everywhere so it will look
good and pretty much any system no
matter what you do to it old products
might not be dead relics they sometimes
just need a little lovin speaking of
whatever Luke was talking about back
when the tablecloth was a completely
different color and I was a completely
that whoa look at that that's amazing I
fix it
so ifixit.com is the place where you can
find wicked awesome guides try to take
apart and fix your electronic doodads as
well as many people don't know this the
tools that you need to go along with
them so you go ahead you look up a guide
and I fix you go well yeah I guess
that's great in theory if only I had
like eighteen suction-cup doodads a
cutter and like that frigging
screwdriver that mm where are you going
to find one of those and I fix that in
fact their pro tech toolkit is in use by
yours truly it's one of the things I
carry in my everyday backpack almost
every day it's got security torque says
try wings all kinds of crazy stuff like
that and you can get your very own by
visiting ifixit.com and using offer code
LTT to save $10 on an order of $50 or
more which basically amounts to $10 off
of a pro tech tool kit but wait there's
more this offer is only valid for two
weeks and if you don't act within the
next two weeks with an offer code ltte
will no longer be good anymore that is
actually that is the case it will expire
and then you will have to wait for us to
do another iFixit thing which we do
fairly frequently because we think
they're great screwdrivers and they
apparently think we're great people too
because they love working with us and
putting words in their mouth um I think
we're done here let's go back to Luke
Luke all right guys what do you think is
this something you do would you
cannibalize your light controller this
really wasn't that hard of a job pretty
simple thing to do I'm sure if you can
build a computer you can do this so is
this something you're interested in do
you think five and a quarter inch base
still have a place do you want to see
them in cases do you still like five and
a quarter Bay devices let me know in the
comments down below or over on the forum
while you're still here on whatever
video player you're watching this on
like dislike favorite share subscribe
follow anything else that you can do
that's around the
video would be great commenting would be
fantastic if you want to check out the
description below this video you can see
our sponsors and whatnot and also this
wonderful shirt which is purchasable now
it's the first time we've actually had
like a line effectives branded shirt and
i think it's pretty cool anyways again
that's in the description down below
over on the forum you can see the rest
of our sponsors how to help us out in
various ways like changing your Amazon
affiliate code or even installing the
various hooks for Chrome or Firefox that
we have for the forum which can change
that affiliate code for you which is
actually kind of cool and helps you let
you know when you have notifications or
pm's and all that kind of stuff anyways
