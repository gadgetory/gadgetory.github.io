happy Friday everyone so a couple of
serendipitous things sort of happened
here one I was in the middle of working
on a video actually come check this
thing out so this is the GPD pocket 2
now naturally my efforts to make my
video about it today have been
interfered with by Windows Update and so
it's been installing this update for the
last well over an hour now but you know
it's hey it's it's chugging along there
at 17% so that's pretty good and then I
realized that our surface go care
package from Microsoft actually arrived
and what's interesting about these two
devices is that while they might not
really look very similar on the surface
really nothing nothing thank you
while they might not look very similar
on the surface under the hood they are
actually more comparable than you might
think so the surface go is using what is
it a 44 there it is a 44 15y processor
what do you like Brendon do you like the
unboxing on black or the unboxing on
woodgrain which do you like the wood
grain alright we're gonna do the wood
grain so it's got a 44 15y processor
four gigs or eight gigs of RAM
it's got 64 gigs or 128 gigs of storage
acclaimed nine hours of battery life and
well this one's got a very tablet like
form factor so all of those specs are
actually really similar to this guy
right here so this is running an n3 7 Y
30 CPU which sounds really different
from a Pentium Gold 44 15y but in terms
of the specs
this one's got a base clock of I think
only one gigahertz but runs at about 1.5
to 1.7 most of the time whereas this one
has a base clock of 1.6 they're both
dual-core quad threaded processors and
don't know how this one turbos yet but
this also comes with four or eight gigs
of RAM and I think it starts at 128 gigs
of storage so the pricing for that is
about 600 and then the pricing for a
surface go with the Inca grams back and
128 gigs of storage is about 549 so the
question becomes would you rather
something more tablet e with a bigger
screen that has what I've always kind of
referred to as with tablets and
uncarrier ball form factor or would you
prefer something that similar in spec
but that will fit in your pocket because
that's their hole that's their whole Jam
with this thing is that you can you can
actually fit it in your pocket and I'm
not gonna do it right now because I
don't want it to go to sleep in the
middle of a Windows Update but but
there's my there's my pocket and that's
kind of where it would go you know maybe
we can do it later when it's Windows
updates so while this gets started with
the hole initialization process we can
kind of walk through the physical
aspects of this device I'm actually
really impressed with it so far like it
doesn't have there it's a funny thing
about the feeling of a device because
sometimes like with with a shoe you know
you might pick up a shoe and go wow this
is really light like this is quality
this is gonna be great for jogging and
then you know other times you might pick
something up and go you know okay sure
you know it's here something like a
piece of audio equipment you know like
if you picked up something like like a
an XLR interface device and look I will
deal with you later Cortana so if you
pick up something like an XLR interface
and it's really light it feels like oh
well you know I paid $200 or $300 for
this and there's nothing inside it that
sucks that's cheap this manages a really
really nice middle ground where it
actually feels light the device is only
about half of a kilogram but it doesn't
feel cheap so it's got the same metal I
think it's some kind of
magnesium alloy that they always use on
surface devices here and then it's kind
of like a two-tone finish to it with the
webcam up here and then it's got okay so
this is according to Microsoft anyway
it's got a surface grade kickstand but I
haven't actually tried it yet yeah yeah
the hinge feels good so this is not the
kind of thing that you would normally
find in a $400 laptop like if you buy a
$400 laptop you're generally ending up
with something that is very plastic II
kind of cheap feeling no I don't want at
us I want to get this going before we
before we go much further so that it can
do its hey we're just getting set up for
you wow I don't know why this wasn't
done out of the box but you know like
when you finish installing an update and
then it's like you're done then it takes
you to the login screen and then you get
there and you log in and it's like hey
please wait while we finished up no no
finish up before don't finish up now you
told me you were done sorry let me just
get my Wi-Fi password in here I'm just
gonna throw in some extra motions so
that hopefully you guys can't reverse
engineer my password here because that
would be really really inconvenient
really inconvenient for me I would have
to take a whole probably about 6 minutes
or so log into my interface and then
change that all right now we have some
important setup to do surely you
couldn't have done that before anyway
let's have a look at what we've got in
terms of accessories before we before we
go much further here ooh oh oh I have I
have a LeBeau nice for people who are
watching live Microsoft sent over a $25
Windows gift card presumably this is for
the win you can't have it Jake Jake's
like reaching in his pocket trying to
trying to get a whatever he was planning
to do ready there so I'm gonna no no no
you can't have a Jake this is going to
be for the viewers this this is for the
viewers they're gonna be able to see it
they're gonna be able to see it with our
high quality
stupid red camera livestream here so
presumably you can buy crap in the
Windows Store with this it actually
comes in that Windows s mode where you
can only get things out of the store oh
oh who can redeem it first let's find
out and it's gone and it's gone so
hopefully someone can get their hands on
that 25 bucks cuz I don't really buy
stuff in the Windows Store then watch me
like get to some point where I'm like
setting this up and like all crap I
really need really really need something
from the Windows Store right about now I
think you can make it out you can make
it out you can make it out we got this
so as you can expect as you would expect
for 400 bucks even though you're getting
a machine with surprising build quality
you're not getting much in terms of
accessories in fact that's all there was
there was these little pieces of paper
which is like showing you where the
volume button is and stuff and then how
the hinge works and all that because you
need a lot of help with your new surface
go and then this you get a you get a
power adapter so this is the first
surface that I'm aware of actually that
charges over USB type-c that's pretty
cool oh wait no crap okay as far as I
know it does charge over USB type-c and
we're gonna test that but they went and
they included the surface the the
surface what's what's that thing called
surface connect connector instead so
let's go ahead and plug this bad boy
yeah I will try the type-c thing on the
stream because okay so the surface
connect finally has an adapter now that
you can buy you can get a little a
little hub that turns this connector
it's like this really bulky thing though
into a single USB 3.1 type-c so that's
one option or my understanding is that
this type C adapter will work and I've
got a couple of type C dongles ready so
I can try those out I'm just gonna go
ahead and use an offline account they
really don't want you doing this anymore
they they're like yeah are you are you
sure are you sure yeah I'm sure okay my
name is Linus my name is Linus and I'm
gonna use this PC no I don't want to
password okay cool
just oh sure sure I'm gonna let Cortana
be my personal assistant sure whatever
tilt forward is that what you like sure
all right cool almost done polishing
things up sure okay thanks for that
actually this is a good opportunity for
us to check out i/o so the USB see that
I mentioned before we've got a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack we've got this dock that requires
unfortunately a bulky not to mention $80
adapter in order to turn it into
anything other than charging for this if
you wanted to just turn it into another
type C port though I'm very grateful
Microsoft included this one wish it was
thunderbolt but again this is a four
hundred to five hundred and fifty dollar
machine so we can't be we can't get too
greedy we've got their magnetic keyboard
connector down here we've actually got a
keyboard will plug that in after microSD
expansion which now you can get micro SD
s up to 512 gigs so that actually gives
you a very reasonable amount of storage
expansion and then yeah that's that's
pretty much it I do want to check out
the webcam because apparently this
machine has Windows hello facial
recognition for sign in which is a
fantastic feature one that I wish every
Windows laptop had like every single one
it is hands down the fastest most
convenient way to sign into a Windows
machine alright so this is the signature
type cover let's go ahead and pop this
bad boy open assuming that I can figure
out how exactly it is that they sealed
sourced from Italy of Cantara Alcantara
I think it's Alcantara Alcantara okay I
said it right the first time I've had to
clarify this multiple times because like
all the car people always like you idiot
it's it's open to Alcantara
alright alright because apparently this
is a this is a material that car people
are very very intimately familiar with
but but computer people have only been
treated to it by Microsoft I'm not aware
of anyone else who's really used it just
a moment oh wow that was great timing
actually very nice so ok
the magnetic docking mechanism feels Wow
that's nice just as strong as we've come
to expect from a surface device it's
really easy to pop on there not a single
time has it managed to be misaligned so
that's great hmm really nice to see now
we can go ahead and pop the kickstand
open same thing this mechanism feels
really good I mean even going back to
the surface RT like that was the first
time we saw what was intended to be a
low cost surface device Microsoft has
done a really good job of not cheaping
out on what makes a device a surface so
it's four hundred bucks but it still
feels good it still has a nice
high-quality hinge in it cuz that's the
kind of stuff that breaks on a cheap
laptop that's the kind of stuff that
drives you crazy or I mean you know back
to the back to the car thing that's the
kind of thing that breaks on a cheap car
like my Civic the engine I think is
gonna run literally forever but even
when I got it which was about how about
ten years ago now oh ok so even when I
got it about ten years ago the the like
the fabric door finishes we're already
peeling off because of the cheap glue in
the factory like it's that little crappy
stuff that starts to break down on a
cheap commodity device that makes it so
you have to replace it because quite
frankly compared to the atom type
processor that was in the last
generation of the GPD pocket I've
actually got it sitting over there
because it's been also in Windows Update
hell compared to the atom based
processors that we found in super
compact machines of yesteryear these KB
Lake based chips are actually fast
enough for a lot of basic tasks so let's
have I really want to see what we're
gonna get out of this thing
in terms of turbo speed because it's a
six watch hip but configurable down to
four hundred four and a half watts I
think whereas this guy is a seven watt
chip and this is not a good indicator so
I actually had assumed that it was
simply because Intel's Ark site was
incomplete
what is it 44 15 why yeah that's right I
had assumed it was because Intel's Ark
site was incomplete that it didn't have
turbo information but it occurs to me
now that this is a Pentium branded chip
and who it might not it might not have
turbo boost okay why I hate being in a
nutshell and my apologies to anyone from
Microsoft watching this but Bing is bad
and it should feel bad okay
in its defense I type out this I put in
40 for 125 why instead of 44 15 why but
I pretty much guarantee Google's gonna
get it no no whoa Google just got beat
by Bing okay
so Google assumed by arc AR K and in an
Intel processor identifier lookup thing
they assumed in an AR C so I ended up
with a bunch of drilling companies with
a 44 125 zip code Bing by contrast ended
up with Ark survival evolved some other
random crap like PDFs
okay so Bing just returned some useless
garbage sometimes but it managed to
return some results for Ark even though
they are for a different model so I you
know what I'm declaring that a victory
for being I had I had meant to
demonstrate that Bing was bad but
actually it did better alright Louis
let's get the right thing looked up here
so 161 dollars that's interesting so
this processor actually costs about $100
more even though the 8 gig 128
configuration only costs about $50 more
than this so what you're paying extra
for in the case of something like a
surface go looks like a bigger display
it's actually yep IPS display looks
pretty nice let's go ahead and crank the
brightness and see what we're looking at
here actually that's not too shabby at
all so you can see it's quite a bit
brighter than the pocket - so you're
paying for a bigger display you're
paying for just plain larger device
there's more materials cost that goes
into it there's more packaging all those
things add up and then you're also
paying for actually its speakers stereo
speakers looks like it's nice to have
this has only a single speaker that's
coming from kind of under the keyboard
here somewhere and then I want to have a
look at how the YouTube playback
experience is this keyboard is really
actually Wow my initial impressions of
it are absolutely great considering how
how low-profile it is I actually haven't
used a surface like a type cover
extensively in quite some time because
alex has been our laptop reviews editor
for wow I guess it must be well over a
year now but it is amazing how much
tactile feel they have managed to
squeeze into sudden device 5 Internet's
down that could be a problem
are we back we're back yes success okay
so if we were to align based on let's
say the tab okay so the edge of the tab
is right about there your Enter key is
looks like a boat where you'd expect
your quotation to be so it's gonna take
some practice see I've got quite small
hands but even for me my fingers are
almost right up against each other in
order to sit on the home row with only
my pinkie having what I would consider
to be a suitable amount of spacing
practice makes perfect for anything like
don't necessarily see it being a huge
concern what I am a little bit worried
about though is the performance I'm
gonna grab I'm gonna grab some avenge
here honestly I'll tell you guys right
now the reason that we had decided to do
a stream of this today was one Friday's
are usually LAN show and so we don't
have a normal release so they're a good
time to put up like a sponsored piece or
or a live stream of something that we
otherwise might not have covered and - I
wasn't sure if we were gonna do a full
review of this thing but I'm actually
getting to the point now where I am I am
pretty impressed with it and I'd love to
hear from you guys in the comments let
me know if you'd like if you'd like us
to spend a good couple weeks with this
thing and really put it through the
paces so far the build quality is what
really sets itself apart now
one thing that's a little frustrating
not just about the surface go but about
a lot of devices like it is that you've
got this really low advertised starting
price but I almost feel like it's a
little bit deceptive because no one
should actually spend $400 on a surface
go people want a full review okay all
right yeah we can we can probably
arrange that so I find it a little bit
deceptive because if you look over here
you've got a couple of SKUs and there's
something that's kind of missing to the
average consumer who's shopping for a
surface go they might look at that and
go well I only need 64 gigs of storage
I'm just gonna put a micro sd in for
additional storage anyway but what's not
mentioned here are we down is this our</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
