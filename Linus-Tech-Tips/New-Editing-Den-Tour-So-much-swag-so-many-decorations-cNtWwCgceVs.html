of Linus Media Group for any extended
period of time there's a good chance
you've come across this tour of our
previous headquarters as well as this
series of videos chronicling our move
into a larger more modern office but
while we did make a video showing our
editors upgrading their workstations for
the new editing den we didn't
aside from thanking NVIDIA for sending
us Titan X's for the new machines get
into the specifics of all the other
hardware and everything that goes around
them we've received a lot of requests to
take a deeper dive into the hardware
that our editors use to do their daily
work so without further ado here we go
Corsairs RMI series power supplies
feature premium components for great
performance with very low noise check
out the link in the video description to
learn more
okay editors come with me what we have
to collect all of your peripherals yeah
I call it an ex master can you guys just
calm down about the MX masters okay
so everybody gets a silverstone
headphone stand silverstone headphone
stands for all yeah everybody gets a new
keyboard 9/10 for you make up stack
because I'm handing you more stuff
before we leave here 910 for you Dennis
though admittedly not a 9/10 you picked
a g7 10 yes oh I actually did - oh you

equitable way to divide the pilot the MX

I like these ones oh look who didn't
unpicked HD a DJ bad so you legitimately
get one of those a reptile on so these

Santa I searched at all here's your desk
organizer
second of all I called not that one okay
I won display Pro colorimeters for all
you can calibrate your monitors so enjoy
your coloring winners everyone
don't you need to check everyone yeah
all right
this is so much value and all these
Christmas presents this is like your
best Christmas ever
that's not even Christmas even better
than that Christmas where I got my
elbows laughs or is it HD you want 650s
sit on my lap a little longer and so
we're putting up this wall decal that's
great it's only slightly less crooked
than Dennis's Iron Man face high school
we may have gone over budget
yeah it's not the 90s what do you need a
calendar for so fractal Josh got this
done did you ask him really Schultz if
you can do an unauthorized frame I did
not
Wow okay so my order came in from TVA I
see Dennis has this weirdo it is
actually pretty cool that Linus said no
desk ornaments okay oh the stuff my pot
is all useless that doesn't help your
case any Michael gix posted a wall in
front of you two silver said that that's
a common space oh no it's not literally
no one has listened to anything I said
about this and your desk is a mess
would you check out this photograph
because honestly every time I do that
makes me laugh someone someone else
missed for them oh ho
have a ball incentive what else is not
walking to be creative I got the most
things for my money I think actually you
did too
yes good so the first big upgrade from
need for seat USA as well as up desk
comm is in the furniture department so
everyone got office comfort or Dominator
chairs you can see that everyone's
equipped with if they were listening the
orange and black versions of the
aforementioned chairs but some people
went and ordered black ones anyway it
was supposed to all be orange and black
for lct and equipped with a height
adjustable desk so these are good for a
couple of reasons number one is that
they allow you to change to a standing
height throughout the day if you just
want to move around and get more
comfortable you can see we've also got
these mats from Costco so that your your
heels and the balls of your feet don't
get fatigued from standing and then the
other thing that they do is they allow
you to sit at a height that's most
comfortable for you so you can see that
Dennis and Etzel both prefer very
different heights even for their seating
position so the other cool thing is that
you can actually program different
heights so you just hold it down and as
long as there's no obstacles under the
desk yet we're good then BOOM this is
Burkle's sitting height which is
obviously not very comfortable for me
but that's the whole point and everyone
being a special case I guess leads us
pretty well into Tarin's workstation
where the first thing you'll notice is
you remove the armrest from his chair I
also like to scoot up as close to my
desk as possible so that I can rest my
arms on it rather than my armrest and
the second thing you'll probably notice
is that he has three monitors unlike
everyone else in the company who was
just fine with 231 inch 4k monitors so
LG kindly provided one extra monitor for
Terron to put scripts or whatever else
on but most people are equipped with 231
mu 97 monitors these are true 4k
monitors so they're 4096 by 2160 not
ultra HD they feature 10 bit panels
they've got height adjust the actually
the full range of ergonomic adjustments
that we need and what's really cool
about them is they actually have support
for not only sRGB color space which
frankly is all we're using for
Shoom to the web anyway but also ninety
nine and a half percent coverage of
adobe RGB and even support for DCI so if
we were ever to you know do something
where it's like yeah we need to do this
as if it's going to be shown in a movie
theater then we would actually have the
capability to do that neat little
accessory that goes with it is actually
these little X right I won display pros
so these allow us to calibrate the
monitors as well as monitor ambient
light so that they can adapt to
different ambient light in the room and
really change much so that you're always
getting the best color accuracy possible
next up we've got our peripherals so
everyone was using just a mishmash of
random stuff back at the old office
Logitech stepped up and offered to
provide us with whatever keyboards we
wanted so you'll find a healthy mix of
g7 ten pluses for those who prefer the
Cherry MX experience and Orion spark g9
tens for those who prefer the Romer G
experience and mice now a lot of people
wanted MX masters Brandon's the only one
who got one of those unfortunately but
the good news is that Logitech's gaming
mice whether it's the G 402 or the G 502
which is what most of the others opted
for offer great tracking and of course
very good performance in ergonomics as
well they're just not Wireless although
Brendan doesn't seem to be using the
wireless functionality of the MX master
anyway for the rest of the peripherals
we actually love these desk mats from
SteelSeries these are great because it
means you can have as much or as little
actual mousepad as you want you can also
throw them in the wash machine something
this one probably needs if you ever need
to clean them and these were a nice
addition as well so in the past no one
really had microphones at their desks
but Razer sent us siren elites for
everyone's workstations and we use them
for all kinds of stuff whether it's
recording those clever voice overs at
the end of next time on scrapyard Wars
or even creating sound effects at our
desks something happens more often than
you'd probably think
that's to finally everyone got their
audio upgraded as well most people were
using some mix of different gaming
headsets that we have left over from
reviews now everyone's using something
from Sennheiser whether it's an hd6 mix
HD 8 DJ or even some people opted for
their audiophile series HD six hundreds
or HD 650 s and of course for some of
those headphones we had to go ahead and
upgrade our audio source so audio
yes that is actually the name of the
company if you haven't heard of them
before sent us stack twos so
Magneto and Modi - DAC and amps for
every one of our editors to power their
new headphones which leads us to the
towers now we didn't change that much
we did add those aforementioned Titan X
graphics cards but we're still using the
same 49 60 X Extreme Edition six cores
32 gigs of kingston memory unless you're
Edie he's got a 12 core Xeon in 64 gigs
of HyperX memory but you know whatever
he's just a boss apparently a couple
people have quadros for doing color work
everyone's got Kingston KC series SSDs
coolermaster v7 50 power supplies note
the only things we really changed were
the coolers where we went with their new
gemin two coolers as well as the cases
so we switched over to Silencio series
cases because what we discovered is that
while the intention with holder water
cooling was actually to overclock the
workstations now that we don't render on
the workstations anyway quiet and
consistent long-term reliable operation
is more of a focus so we went back to
air cooling which has fewer points of
failure and we went with cases that had
noise dampening material built into the
inside so that the office environment
except when people are talking or
filling in it is really really quiet
exerted editing so so black which leads
us to our last demo if I could get the
camera focusing its attention on
Brandon's system
Boop what's all this then yes General
Electric kitted us out with 2,000 volt
amp UPS units for every single
workstation meaning that even in the
event of a power outage not only our
server room but also the individual
workstations of our editors are
protected and will continue to run on
battery power for quite some time like
in excess of 20 minutes giving us time
to save our work correctly you know even
if premiers being a bit of a Butthead or
whatever else back up all the data to
where needs to go and shut down the
systems correctly a very very important
thing to be able to do so that's pretty
much it while I think we can all agree
that my team and I struggled during the
move and shortly after the move to
maintain our usual standard of quality
with the content I really feel like
we've finally found our stride and the
content that you guys are looking at now
reflects not only the better space that
we have to work in but also the better
equipment that we have in order to
create our videos
so all that's left now is to thank our
sponsor Dollar Shave Club who actually
this it was not planned but incidentally
was the sponsor of our last office tour
back when we were at the old place the
one I referred to at the beginning so if
you're not sure what Dollar Shave Club
is guys it's the club where you join for
well not dollar but a few dollars just a
few dollars a month where you can shave
your face prepare your face for shaving
put stuff on your face that smells nice
after you're done shaving and wipe your
butt yes they have supplies for all of
those things it's available in Canada
the US and Australia and basically it's
for people who want to look like they go
out of their house without actually
going to the store finding someone to
open up the stupid unfathomably why does
this exist gage that store I mean I know
why they exist it's because people steal
them but people wouldn't steal the razor
blades and cartridges if they weren't so
freakin expensive so anyway Dollar Shave
Club solves all those problems by making
it easier to get them and cheaper they
just show up at your door you shave you
look nice you wipe your butt you smell
nice on your butt I mean if that's a
factor for you and yeah so visit
dollarshaveclub.com slash Lynas linked

club so that's pretty much it guys
