something very special so I haven't
checked out the Kraken before that's a
razer headset emphasis on comfort and
sound quality but especially comfort
this right here is a very special
edition of the Razer Kraken headset this
is the signature Black Edition so every
signature Black Edition is numbered they
only make 1337 each year for their
select special partners and you can't
buy these you cannot buy this so there
will be no link to buy or if there is a
link it won't work but you can
experience the unboxing with me there
you go each one of them comes with a
little signed letter from min-liang tan
who is their CEO and a chief gamer so
that is a very cool title but I guess
when you're the CEO you can give
yourself whatever title you want
I'm the chief gamer of you know Sony or
something you know like why not so as
with our current gender the Kraken has
evolved from a razer classic so the yeah
took several years of sampling yep so
basically several years and this is a
signature Black Edition which is an
all-black version of the Kraken so here
we go we're going to go ahead and pull
this guy out so we'll have a look at
what there is in here in terms of
documentation Razer packaging is always
like so pros like so good just love it
so stylish glossy text on the matte
paper alright we got here
so congratulations there's no turning
back QuickStart guide for the Kraken as
well as a Razer sticker there you go
shows you how to sort of do things and
and operate stuff it also shows you how
to extending your headphones lifespan
huh we recommend stretching the
headphones gently apart before placing
them over your head so feel a little
cool little tips and tricks there now we
can go ahead and all look at these
little rubber elastics hold it in place
see integrate it into the packaging
I can tell you already the materials
feel very very comfy so it's quite light
this is folding so there's travelers are
two versions of the crackin there's the
Kraken in the Kraken pro so this is the
folding version both of them are super
optimized for music or games I've said
this before but I'll say it as many
times as it takes until people start
listening there's no such thing as a
good premium gaming headphone or gaming
headset it's called a good headset or
headphones if they're good that means
their audio reproduction quality is good
which means that game audio will be good
so good is good and bad is not good so
that's all there is to it
so these are with 40 ml drivers and
supremely comfortable position I don't
remember where I was going with that so
the point is good is good so when they
say is so when Razer brands it as good
for music and good for games that means
it's good for movies too don't worry
about it okay so check this out guys
look at all the look at all the
cushioning up here so they've got like a
mesh like kind of a sporty type material
here which means that if your head gets
hot or you're sweating or whatever else
it should be quite breathable a lot of
headphones make this mistake where they
use like a pleather or some kind of non
breathable surface here not everyone has
such long hair that they're going to get
airflow in there so if you don't then
this will still breathe quite nicely and
the cups themselves they don't rotate
much no this is something I haven't seen
in a while however I mean the joke I
always make when I want to unbox
headphones and headsets that rotate a
lot is if your ears are positioned here
the Missal fit just fine so I think this
will be just fine for 99.9% of people
plus you can probably get away without
it because there's so much flexibility
in the ear cup itself so it's hard to
hold these I mean the folding mechanism
works quite well they fold very easily
so there you go that's how I can show
you that it will position on your head
correctly no matter what even though
there's no flexibility here but that
gives it a stronger hinge so see what's
that made of
I'm not quite sure if that's metal
construction or not does not appear to
be no it looks like plastic construction
but it does look reasonably strong so
here else to see how much flex there is
to that so the hinge feels pretty good
actually
shouldn't be any reason for it to get
damaged in normal in normal sort of
where the extensions go quite far it can
see like that so I could wear these
realistically if my head was this big
which probably looks kind of ridiculous
I have about a medium sized head like
literally I have a medium sized head I
wear a medium size motorcycle helmet so
that should give you guys some idea how
it will fit on you these are obviously
open or are they hold on guess I'll be
able to hear hey slick say something say
something quieter than that don't yell
go again okay yeah they're relatively
open they're not they're not super
closed by any stretch of the imagination
but 40ml drivers did I mention that
before okay okay okay so I've talked
about how comfortable they look let's
see how comfortable they actually are
here's how deep the foam on them goes
check that out if that doesn't if that
doesn't get the point across and I don't
know what does so let's go ahead and get
these adjusted the car Carius headset
actually is one of the headsets that
i've looked at in the past that was
extremely impressive in terms of comfort
sound quality wasn't necessarily you
know up there with something from like
you know something that costs more or is
like more like add sort of a premium
music headphones but comfort it could
never fault the car carriers for that
actually no they are there hold on I'll
be back so we did figure it out after
some sort of listening testing basis
outstanding and then next huh
they're closed okay so once you put them
on the surroundings around you like they
become muffled but you can still hear
pretty well so they're not super sound
isolating but we did notice that when
some when someone's when you're
listening to it the sound is being
delivered sort of to your ears and not
so much to your surroundings around you
so if you were using these for your
daily commute number one if they are
extremely comfortable number two is
you're not going to put the people
around you to an extreme level of
discomfort so yeah all the stuff I said
about this headband this is probably the
best headband I've yet encountered
because the
design of it is just super smart like
there's two solid pieces in here there's
one up here and there's one at the
bottom and then what they have is they
have like a foam middle in between them
so this right here is like one big fat
cushion so there's there's harder stuff
here and there's harder stuff here but
this just sits on your head like a cloud
there's a lot of flex to it and then
that combined with the overall lightness
of the headphones in spite of how large
they are and the softness of the ear
cups makes them extremely comfortable I
mean I think if Razer is trying to make
a comfortable headphone then mission
accomplished so guys remember there's
two versions there's the Kraken and the
Kraken pro the pro has an actual mic
which this one doesn't have and the crap
and the kraken folds so the pro is more
like optimized for gaming and the Kraken
is more of a more of a headphone so I
understand how it's not optimized for
gaming in that sense but if you did use
a snowball mic or some other kind of mic
then it would still be just fine for
gaming because remember guys good
headphones are good headphones thank you
