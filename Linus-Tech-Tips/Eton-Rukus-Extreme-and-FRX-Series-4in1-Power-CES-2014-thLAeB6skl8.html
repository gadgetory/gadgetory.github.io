brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital now this isn't our first
time covering an eight on product but
we're going to start with something that
will look a little bit familiar for you
guys so this is the rugged ruckus to
which is similar to the old one that is
to say it's splash-proof drop proof very
very rugged and of course it is a
Bluetooth speaker so it supports
Bluetooth 4.0 on the new version it has
an upgraded solar panel with a higher
amperage output so it can charge your
device is better as well as charging its
own internal battery better it supports
NFC as well as speakerphone on like the
old one and it has improved audio
quality so here's the look there we go
there's that USB out on the back
whatever will do b-roll of that this
right here is the ruckus extreme which
is pretty much that one except more of
the same it has a much better quality
audio compared to the regular rugged
ruckus too now we're moving into
something that I promised the guys here
at the booth I would describe as
ridiculous this is the FRx series we've
got the FRx for as well as the FRx 5
they are AM and FM radios they support
general weather alerts as well as local
weather alerts using s AME there are
four different ways of charging these
they can charged by solar we've come to
expect that from them they can charge
via a hand crank right there they can
charge using alkaline batteries so you
can put them in right there and finally
they can charge over USB so you will
pretty much never be stuck in the dark
or out of the loop because it also
supports an LA LED flashlight on the top
the main difference between the 4 and
the 5 is of course the increased size of
the LED flashlight as well as this is
the one that supports s AM II the last
thing that I believe I did miss just a
moment to go on this one is the fact
that it also charges your USB devices so
you can use the crank to keep your phone
topped up in an emergency the last one
speaking of emergencies is the blackout
buddy see oh so this is just like the
regular black out buddy it plugs into
your wall outlet and
in the event of a power loss the
flashlight automatically goes off on so
that you can find it and pick it up and
use it as a flashlight it also acts as a
nightlight regularly so if you cover up
the light sensor it'll just have a nice
little blow to it and this one unlike
the original one also has a built-in
carbon monoxide detector so in the event
of emergency it does have a battery on
board so it will continue to function
very cool little piece of technology
guys don't miss any of our CES 2014
