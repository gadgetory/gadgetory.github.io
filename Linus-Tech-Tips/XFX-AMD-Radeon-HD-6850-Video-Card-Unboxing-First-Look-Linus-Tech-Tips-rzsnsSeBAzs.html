the Radeon 6870 but I had a bit of a
realization today that I haven't even
done an unboxing of the 6850 so let's
get started here it's going to open up
this XFX Radeon 6850 so here we are
let's start getting this opened up and
basically the Radeon 6850 has the same
amount of RAM it has the same GPU on it
as the 6870 it is a member of the same
series of video card which is 6800
series and the only real difference is
that it has a few less functional units
and it's not quite as fast so oh yeah
it's also cheaper I guess that's another
factor so XFX has a little brochure in
here about some of their products
including their Pro Series some adapters
and connectors that you might need if
you're going to run eyefinity for
example some monitor stands two or three
times monitor I didn't even know AXA
fantastic so I'm glad they have this
brochure in here some low profile kits
for their graphics cards all the power
supplies we mentioned that already specs
like little internal like cutout that's
nice it's useful you know all right
we've got a door hanger Do Not Disturb
on gaming they've even updated it I have
one of these with the old XFX dog on it
or wolf or whatever it's supposed to be
and yeah now they've updated it cool so
there's some information on the North
America limited lifetime warranty
remember XFX includes a double lifetime
warranty that means that even if you
sell the card whoever you sell it to
also gets a lifetime warranty they also
have a modder friendly warranty which
means you can install aftermarket
heatsinks without voiding your warranty
as long as you keep the original on
driver CD install guide throw it away
AMD graphics card another disk throw it
away and quick install guide if you've
ever installed a graphics card before
throw it away ok nothing in there seems
like Erik ok next we have the Radeon 68
50 itself now something that I want to
point out is that this is not a
reference cooler this is a reference
board but this is not a reference cooler
design the reference cooler you can
actually see a reference 6870 here now
why you might ask
do 68 70s come with a reference cooler
and the 68 50 does not and the reason is
because AMD has decided that for this
particular graphics card launch they are
not going to limit board partners in
terms of which graph which cooler they
use on the 68 50 so that means we've got
all kinds of unique designs so you can
see the XFX one uses a flower style
heatsink which looks like it has two
large heat pipes so here I want you to
have a look at that heat pipe in there
that appears to be 8 Oh words fail me I
can't remember how many millimeters that
looks like it is but that's a big heat
pipe or rather 2 and then you can see
there is a copper core to the GPU cooler
itself you can see that through there
and then that runs out to aluminum fins
which are doing most of the cooling work
now I just want to kind of look down
here it looks like the graphics card
memory chips are not directly cooled
although they are all situated you can
see the memory chips here and you can
kind of see them through there are all
situated almost directly under the fan
so you're going to get a lot of
incidental airflow yet they've also
cleverly shrouded the cooler in such a
way that when the airflow goes okay so
you're pushing air into the cooler that
means you're going to have a lot of
incidental airflow coming out this way
and they've also put vents here at the
back so you make sure that some of it is
going to be able to run over the VRMs
and then carry that heat out of the
graphics card you've got a 6 pin PCI II
power connector here you've got yeah
actually you know what I'm totally wrong
just like the 68 70 the RMS are actually
here and there is a little ventilation
hole here in the shape of the XFX logo
and as you may or may not have picked up
on
now the 68 50 has fewer connectors on
the back panel it has two DVI one HDMI
and one DisplayPort the 6870 actually
includes two DVI one HDMI and two mini
DisplayPort so it's a slightly different
layout they are let's just compare those
really quick so this is more like the
layout on the previous 5000-series cards
we've got a backplate here holding on
our GPU cooler we've got a standard PCIe
16x interface just like the 68 70 the 68
50 only supports two-way crossfire not
3-way crossfire
I think that covers pretty much
everything I wanted to say this is an 80
mil fan so it should operate very
quietly thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the XFX Radeon HD 6850 and
