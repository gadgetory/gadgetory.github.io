calling holy Sh
we opened up and had a look at the
biggest SSD we'd ever seen and in what's
likely to become a recurring theme on
these segments
today we'll be checking out the largest
mousepad that we've ever seen so without
further ado this is the pad Zilla a
mousepad that we have no idea how
managed to arrive here I mean I don't
even know how these guys got our address
cuddle bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you browse the web as
if you're in one of 20 different
countries check out the link in the
video description to learn more so I
guess all we can really do is open it up
and have a look it's got some weight to
it as you'd probably expect comes in a
big tube and surprisingly it actually
doesn't smell so maybe there's something
to all that nonsense that they're
talking about with their natural
renewable rubber and non-toxic and
odorless and all that stuff and Wow so
as advertised the pad Zilla is extremely
big they actually apparently even have
bigger sizes coming but this is the only
one that they have now according to
their website but still I mean even this
the first question that comes to mind
for me here is what on earth would
anyone need such a large pad for
sunshade for your car protection from
the elements sleeping pad for when you
get tired at a LAN party you need
another one for a blanket
annoying your coworkers a glorious PCMR
fashion statement extreme low
sensitivity gaming okay but being
serious again for a moment here for
context this is the qck XXL that I use
on a day-to-day basis it is large enough
for me to comfortably at 800 dpi with an
ultra wide 34 inch monitor have room for
my mouse on the right my wider than
normal g7 10 plus keyboard in the middle
and an additional Mouse on the left for
me to use my laptop when it comes to
that also at 800 dpi this is the pad
Zilla for scale
so truthfully it shouldn't come as any
surprise that I questioned the
practicality somewhat of this product
but on their site they have definitely
managed to come up with some things on
the benefits page so let's go through
what they think the point of this
product is benefits number one big ok
what we're all gonna have to agree that
big is a benefit before we accept that
for accept that premise number two
excellent tracking cushion and glide I
will give them excellent glide and I
will give them no issues with tracking
actually but it is a little bit thinner
than the qck XXL it's a little bit
thinner than I would like so you know
we'll give them a good two out of three
they're beautiful designs some of them
yes some of them not so much Luke
mentioned that we actually had two of
them I don't personally find this design
to be particularly beautiful but I mean
if you pay like three times as much you
can get your own design printed on it I
guess is kind of cool okay so a half
point there
yes protection fair enough okay Jess
protection I can kind of get into
because we've experienced a fair bit of
damage on our desks washable this is
actually something I really like about
cloth mouse pads in general the fact
that you can you can actually hand wash
them with a mild soap and water or I've
actually machine washed them before
without too many issues but I'm sure
they don't recommend that silken surface
this is where they lost me a little bit
because I personally prefer a bit of a
coarser weave for a little bit more
resistance but your mileage may vary on
that one literally huh get it because
your mileage would be better on a
smoother surface mileage may vary
um and multiple uses so actually I
wasn't that far off with my goofy skip
thing which I had actually created
before looking at this wall art table
protection floor mat meditation mat dog
cat pad trade show table dressing
company promotion techy presence and
more okay called saying something has
multiple uses because it can be a
present is not not not valid they do
actually this is kind of funny they have
an in
higher grouping of like separate domains
like drum mats comm which are exactly
the same product except on drum mats
dot-com they put it under a drum and
finally the last one just playing cool
