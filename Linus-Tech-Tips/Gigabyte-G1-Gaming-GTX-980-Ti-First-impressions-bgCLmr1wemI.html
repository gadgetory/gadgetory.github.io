2015 and thank you to MSI and lynda.com
for making our coverage of this event
possible this year check them out in the
video description down below we took
note the gigabyte g1 gaming 980 TI
featuring a new and improved wind forest
cooler with three fans five eight
millimeter heat pipes and one six
millimeter heat pipe a triangular
heatsink design and a backplate which is
not actually standard on 980ti switch
will all come together and provide 600
watts of thermal dissipation i'll cover
its thermal performance more in an
actual review video once I'm back from
Computex so stay tuned for that but in
terms of aesthetics it also has some
more silver accents on the actual like
front part of the heat sinks which looks
pretty sleek and actually makes it look
different from other windforce coolers
which is a little bit of a change maybe
not to grill them too much and also the
logo that gigabyte logo is backlit with
a seven different color LED those colors
are white teal purple yellow green red
and blue the RGB colors are controllable
through a downloadable use software
utility from gigabyte not a physical
button just so you know and there are
two physical buttons but they do the
same thing one of them is stop and the
other one is silent they're on each side
of the gigabyte logo and they just
essentially turn off the fans in terms
of the actual GPU I don't know how fast
it is the 980ti is an extremely new GPU
and this is an extremely new cooler and
etc etc etc so they haven't locked down
the core clock speed we do know that the
memory clock speed is still at stock so
7010 megahertz and it has 6 gigabytes of
RAM so it's not an extra memory card but
they're still playing with that boost
clock and I have no idea how fast it
actually is so we'll see once I get it
back into my hands back at the office in
terms of i/o you've got DVI HDMI and
DisplayPort along with either one DVI or
two more display ports for a total of a
potential 5 outputs natively I would say
that I've done too many reviews on
windforce cards to actually count and
this isn't technically a win forest card
because the g1 card but someone would
probably go and actually count it so
like I said stay tuned for that in the
future we'll definitely have a review on
this card I'm interested to see how high
they get that boost clock considering
how close 980ti actually already is to a
Titan X alright guys that's it
to see what else Computex has to offer
and i think a lot of it is going to be
different variations of a 980ti so
that's going to be fun to see alright
thanks again to Emma SCI for sending us
here this year we wouldn't be here
without them
check out that all the products that
they have available at Computex through
this year at the bitly link down in the
description down below also thanks to
lynda.com check out lynda.com slash
Computex for a 10 day free trial let me
know on Twitter or in the constant below
or over on the forum or wherever you
want which card you think is gonna reign
supreme at the end of Computex because I
believe there's gonna be a ton of
variations of this GPU also don't forget
to subscribe like share comment favorite
all that good stuff I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
