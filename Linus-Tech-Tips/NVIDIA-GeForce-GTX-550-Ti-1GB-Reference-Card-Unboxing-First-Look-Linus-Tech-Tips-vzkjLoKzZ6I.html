pleasure unboxing before this is an
Nvidia branded GeForce GTX it is a
reference card so it has a completely
black box all on the outside is
completely black better go clean my lens
there that's better okay so what we want
I want to do is start opening this thing
up it's got a nice glossy branding
finish on it to go with the overall
matte black box you can see here
something I've never seen on a graphics
card box before and that is designed and
built by and Vidya so we're going to go
ahead open this guy up we find a white
inside to the box all right now here's
something dear valued editor something
something something so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take this off because
I don't know how much of that is
confidential but yeah okay so it's
telling me a few different things first
of all that this is equipped with 192
cuda cores and 192 bit gd-r gd-r 5
memory interface which is actually
pretty cool because it allows the board
partners to mix and match the densities
of the memory modules they're putting on
so that they can achieve a one gig
capacity without an even memory
bandwidth interface so that's pretty
cool
has faster clock speeds over the GTS 450
it's younger brother and it has a little
list of what all is going to be
including here so first we got some
stickers and these are nice stickers I
actually really like these there's a you
can see there's a bit of a mmm it's hard
to see that in the camera but there's a
pail there we go there we go there's an
Nvidia next to that little logo we've
got some Nvidia logos we've got one of
their Nvidia characters and a GeForce
GTX sticker very nice ok we have a
driver disc which is empty so this is
just a reference package that does not
contain a driver disc because it shipped
out before there was a driver disc
available for this particular card
here's where some accessories would go
if there were any included I suppose so
let's go ahead and pull that up alright
I've got a gtx 550
guy reviewers guide which is highly
confidential and you guys won't be
looking at that and then what do we have
down here we've got a video card which I
will assume at this point based on the
evidence I've seen thus far is a geforce
gtx 550 and then we have nothing
underneath so this is a retail boxed
card that doesn't quite contain a full
retail package oh wow thank you for
buying it a bunch of different language
is very nice nice touch
okay so let's close up the box and we'll
use that we will at the video part
itself alright so here it is this is the
gtx 550 ti it features a very similar
look to the 560 TI reference design card
that is the central fan with a flower
style heatsink so if i spin this you can
see the heatsink a little bit better and
let me see if it's got any heat pipes
going on on there i have to try and get
a different angle no it looks like this
one unlike the 560 TI does not require a
heat pipe cooler for optimal performance
so nvidia has opted just for a standard
flower heatsink cooler you can see the
shroud is recessed a little bit just
like the 560 TI so the fan actually
sticks up a little bit above the top of
the shroud so one of the things that
it's likely that this does is if you're
in an SLI configuration your cards are
close together it should give your fan a
little bit more breathing room to pull
an air around it and make sure the card
stays adequately cool you can see
something here that we've actually seen
in the past from Nvidia cards and that
not all the PCIe pins are present on the
bottom connector that doesn't matter
actually all that is is they've removed
some of the unnecessary pins that they
don't need it will not affect
performance or the bandwidth available
to your card in any way shape or form
you can also tell this is an engineering
sample card by the fact that the PCI
Express lock is not broken off here so
this card will not lock into a slot it
has a little piece here that will
prevent it from doing so so it can be
easily removed by reviewers alright
we've got an SLI connector so this card
is SL
I'm ready but that is two-way SLI and
not 3-way SLI just so you guys are aware
because it's only got a single connector
that means it's only compatible with
two-way SLI on the back we find the
connectors that we're getting pretty
used to seeing we've got a mini HDMI as
well as two DVI connectors although
please do note you can only use two of
any any two of these three connectors at
any given time if you do install two
cards in your system then you can run
three monitors off of the two cards
together to run Nvidia surround with up
to three monitors here on the back you
see one of the cool things I was talking
about before one two three four five six
memory modules but it's a one gig card
so Nvidia very cleverly has allowed
their partners to use four lower density
memory modules and two higher density
ones to achieve the five to achieve the
one gig memory capacity otherwise we'd
be stuck with one of those odd
capacities like we've seen on previous
Nvidia cards like 768 or 1280 you know
those sort of oddball memory capacities
but NVIDIA has engineered the card to
have excellent memory bandwidth so
they've increased it from 128-bit to 192
bit but they've also managed to keep a
nice round number on the memory capacity
so there you go that's kind of cool it
also helps the board partners achieve
slightly lower board costs by using
these lower density chips to to get up
to that capacity so it really is a win
win win for everyone the consumer gets
more bandwidth gets more memory and the
board partners save on some cost and in
videos engineers are fairly pretty
clever right about now so right here
we've got a PCI Express 6 pin connector
so that is the only external power that
this card requires we can also clearly
see the four pin PWM fan connector for
that fan for the heatsink we can also
see the power delivery in there so
fairly basic there's no active cooling
on the power well okay there's act ok
there's no heat sinks on the power
circuitry but what we do have is a fair
amount of airflow is going to be coming
from the fan and going over the power
connect or the power circuitry because
there is absolutely nothing restricting
the airflow out this way so what that
means is that the gtx 550 ti
is going to be a fairly internal exhaust
card because you can see here right
along the entire top of the shroud
there's a fairly substantial gap that's
going to allow air to come out this way
cool these memory chips cool anything up
here along the card same thing along the
bottom you're going to see there's a
fairly substantial gap there so well
we're going to be exhausting some of the
air out of the back plate most of it is
going to be coming out the top the
bottom and the back of the card like
maybe 20% of it is going to be extremely
exhausted now this isn't going to be a
very hot running card so I don't think
that's going to be a huge problem for
you one last thing I should probably go
over before we end here is that it does
support all of the usual Nvidia
technology so we've got CUDA 3d vision I
already mentioned SL i already mentioned
invidious around but all of that good
stuff is supported this is a gaming
grade part it's targeted at people who
are playing at 1680 by 1050 or lower so
don't expect to be you know grabbing one
of these if you're running on a huge
30-inch monitor or anything like that
but it is a gaming grade sort of a entry
level performance grade card so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
geforce gtx 550 ti or ty if you prefer
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos Kirk I forgot to
mention physics and I also wanted to
mention the just the clock speeds of
this particular card so it's clocked at
900 megahertz which is substantially
higher than the old GTS 450 but the
actual power consumption of the card has
only gone up slightly so I'm really
looking forward to getting this guy on
the test bench once again don't forget
to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
