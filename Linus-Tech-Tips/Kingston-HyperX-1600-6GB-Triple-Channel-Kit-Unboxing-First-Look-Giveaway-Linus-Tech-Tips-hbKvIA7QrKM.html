of a Kingston triple channel memory kit
this is an evaluation kit so it's
basically exactly like a retail kit
acceptances evaluation here so that's
going to be the one key difference this
is a ddr3 1600 megahertz c9 triple
channel kit it is a six gig kit so each
of these modules is two gigs and it is
from their hyperx line so the heat
spreaders are blue now the question you
might be asking is why do I care about
this and the answer is because we are
going to give it away so all you need to
do is leave a comment under this video
declaring why you are worthy to receive
the kingston hyperx modules that i have
on box by the way because i am opening
them because i do need to use them for a
video before I ship it to you and
sometime in the next month or so or
whenever I feel like it the cameraman
and I will do a draw to see who is going
to be the lucky winner out of everyone
who posted why they deserve these hyperx
modules and then we will ship it to them
this is open to anyone in the world as
long as you're subscribed to both of my
channels that means Linus tech tips and
NCIX com we will be verifying that so
make sure that you are subscribed and
then you will get these shiny silver
blue memory modules and there's also
some green and some gold and some red
and black and even like kind of some
brown if you look really close at these
chips it's kind of like a rainbow hey
there's some pink too i love it it's
like shiny sparkly pink you know
kingston that that is like just a little
touch of flair that you know it needs if
that little sparkly pink on there that's
great anyway so if you want to win this
then yeah leave the comment oh also
there's some included documentation here
probably shows you how to install ram
yeah it shows you how to install ram ram
installing ram is pretty easy if you
don't know how to install ram feel free
to also post that under the video and
then i might even i might even arrange
for you to get picked
