and that is the unboxing of what may be
the lightest box that I have unboxed
today this is the Linksys AE 2500 dual
band wireless end USB adapter so what is
dual band good for that is a question
that I have actually never been asked in
any way shape or form but I'm going to
answer it anyway because that is a
question that I actually had at one
point in time before I knew what dual
band was good for so dual band can mean
a couple of different things so there's
dual band which means 2.4 gigahertz and
5 gigahertz this router or adapter sort
of you know one or the other can operate
either on the higher frequency or on
this lower frequency and that is to get
away from interference of other devices
that operate on those frequencies such
as say for example in the case of 2.4
gigahertz cordless phones for example
that's an example for you but there's
also concurrent dual band concurrent
dual band allows you to use both of
those frequencies at the same time in
order to transfer more data so this
isn't concurrent dual band this is dual
band so 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz
dual band 300 megabit per second so that
is how many lanes of data transfer there
are on a given band not that you're
actually using more bands ok and then
we've got superior range advanced
security and easy setup so easy setup is
something I've pretty much come to
expect from Cisco Linksys products at
this time we did setup their range
extender a little while ago and that was
very easy this one comes with a wireless
adapter subsidy you know what I'm gonna
go ahead and I'm gonna say don't throw
this away especially if you're not an
advanced user this is actually pretty
handy and does make setting up the
device very very simple so you're still
gonna want to grab the latest drivers
from the Linksys website but just for
the for the initial setup this is not a
bad way to go so this is the AE 2500
which includes run CD first a warning
and an adapter
and it's a USB network adapter made by
Linksys and/or cisco depending on how
you prefer to look at it if you know
what I don't know what else to tell you
guys here because it is a USB wireless
adapter and it is aha maybe we'll talk
about this hold on where are they
I'm sure I have them somewhere wait for
it come with me here we go ha
it is designed in a matching style to go
with and match your other Linksys by
cisco routers and products that are
wireless and look good with them and
have a similar finish so over here check
this out see how we have a similar
finish on our USB adapter as we have on
our cisco router so this is the e 4200
which is their high-end dual band 4 50
megabit router this is not this is not
for a 50 megabit but it is dual band but
if I recall correctly that guy is
concurrent so hold on a second nope just
do that not concurrent yes simultaneous
ok so yeah that one is concurrent this
one is not concurrent thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the ae 2500
