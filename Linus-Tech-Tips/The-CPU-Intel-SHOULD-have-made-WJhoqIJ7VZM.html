popular by the original IBM PC that 40
years later 40 years after the original
8086 CPU we are still using it so it's
pretty important but when team blue
decided to celebrate that anniversary
with what basically amounted to an up
clocked and upmarket core i7 8700 K we
were a little underwhelmed I mean I have
been asking Intel for years to do
something truly special with their
really high-end stuff and like look at
this it's got the same cores the same
IHS the same green substrate the same
non soldered thermal interface material
so we figured if Intel's not gonna do it
then we're gonna do it we're gonna build
the 8086 K that should have been and
we're gonna do it in style speaking of
doing it in style
madrenas coffee Wow look how great that
can looks madrenas blend specialty cold
brew coffee Zin two 16-ounce grab-and-go
cans for everyone's convenience check
them out and use offer code Linus to
save 40% at the link below today
before we could do anything we needed to
make sure that our CPU was performing
the way that we would expect because
we'll be comparing our end results later
on to make sure that we didn't make it
worse with that out of the way it's time
to shut it all down
pull the CPU and deal it it we've deal
it had plenty of processors before but
this time will be slightly different
because now we need to lap it which for
the uninitiated means removing the upper
layer of nickel plating and leaving
behind a smooth flat copper finish for
us to play with two hours and two
bloodied thumbs later Anthony eased off
the manual work to finalize the design
that will be edging into the top of the
IHS we weren't sure at this stage
whether or not the resolution would be
too fine to etch into the size of a CPU
but once we finished with the design we
decided it was time to practice our gold
plating with a dead CPU extra hours of
lapping not shown so this is our lap
teeth spreader I've got that exposed
copper going on there I guess the
smoother this is to start with the less
gold we would have to waste applying it
thicker and then polishing it down right
right okay what we need to do is we need
to wrap this yes around like this so
that there's no metal actually showing
it is this that's to absorb the liquid
okay and none can be exposed and all the
exposed but don't do it too tightly
because the fluid needs to be able to
flow with the electricity okay so this
hooked is just gonna hold our our piece
then no oh we're gonna brush it on or we
brush it on yeah so our gold solution is
actually clear dip that in there that
gauze will actually clear up and once
it's fully soaked you just brush the
gold on yep they say to do it as if
you're petting a cat after a while we
should start to see some yellowing so it
paints on a pretty thin layer yeah yeah
it's basically microscopic oh I'm just
starting to yellow a little bit
it's really subtle Wow it's hard to it's
hard to tell cuz it happens so slowly
brush plating really wasn't what I was
expecting when I had said hey guys let's
make a gold-plated CPU largely because I
had actually never heard of it but it
ended up working out great
check out the difference from the start
now applying conformal coating to the
PCB or substrate that's going to be
nearby anywhere you're gonna be using
liquid metals pretty standard operating
procedure so we've already done that all
over the green part here but the unusual
thing we're doing today is we're gonna
Plasti Dip a cpu so we're gonna go ahead
and cover up the die and that's just for
thermal performance reasons we wouldn't
actually be harming it by classy tipping
it then we're gonna go hammer oh lordy I
put that on a little thick good oh boy
oh boy the adhesion to the conformal
coating is not ideal and I wish I'd gone
on a little lighter but what's done is
done now so now that we've got a smooth
gold-plated IHS you're probably thinking
to yourself well hey almost home-free
right throw it in your guys's laser
cutting slash engraving machine I mean
wow those test runs of the of the
pattern look great and boom it's off to
the races but unfortunately because we
don't have like a solid-state laser or
what's what's the other one my bro fiber
optic laser and for that matter like
almost no one around here does cuz
they're really expensive we're gonna
need a different plan so we're gonna do
it the old-fashioned way it's off to the
jewelry store we're gonna engrave it
that sounds like company's gonna engrave
it I'll find someone hurt he knows a guy
while Anthony gets our practice piece
over to the engraver it's time to gold
plate our real IHS so he took a turn
with the electroplating kit when he got
back after a bit of Polish and some
touch-ups here and there and a second
trip to the jeweler I think the end
result speaks for itself
so something we didn't account for in
the original plan was the extra
thickness that would be added by the
Plasti Dip
so a quick extra step we had to add was
just sanding down the bottom of the IHS
a little bit to account for that
clearance because it's the glue that
we're gonna apply around the edges when
we reel it it that's gonna hold it on so
that's sort of important so now all
that's left is to peel this off exposing
our die
liquid metal to die no no no no no and
that's more like it
it's so chilly in here that it's not
staying very liquidy
I just want to err on the side of a
lighter rather than a heavier
application here I think that's pretty
close actually let's put our CPU back
together oh that was spot-on no one
after like that that should be tight
enough okay all right we'll be back this
is it this is we think the limited
edition cpu intel should have made black
PCB gold spreader custom engraving and
to make sure it still works probably a
good idea cool if you're into that sort
of thing anyway so we want to enable XMP
and disable multi-core enhancement well
it looks like yes step 10 cool 27
degrees looks good oh cool
so the IHS is lapped we've got liquid
metal on it theoretically it should be
better than before in terms of its
temperatures but we also engraved it and
we don't know if that's gonna cause
micro ridges around the engraving or
anything like that there's a very good
chance it could and we applied a new
layer of metal on
top of it that obviously wasn't lapped
so we don't know exactly how flat it is
so we're hoping for the best but we
won't know for sure until we actually
test it we're using an air cooler so we
don't have to wait around for the
coolant to reach equilibrium max so 64
to 71 degrees does that start 67 to 71
does that sound reasonable yes look at
that we had a spike and then it settled
in yeah because that was in turbo no
it's no longer boy if you look up here
oh okay but was that the same way you
tested it last time did you take your
temps praetor ARP with turbo or without
without without so oh so then we're
killing it oh yeah we're like 62 degrees
yeah we're not finished our before and
after testing yet though
now the CPUs thermals were not good
enough before we liquid metal did to
really do any overclocking so all we
could do was turn on multi-core
enhancement and then where's this guy
and then max out these power limits here
so 4095 here one place over here and 395
here so now we can have a look at what
kind of a performance improvement we can
get now that our true limited edition
very limited edition one-of-a-kind CPU
can be fully unfettered so let's hit it
again we're running at 4.30 4.3 68
degrees on the hottest core Wow dang
that max turbo though we could just run
that all day as it turned out we didn't
gain much in gaming but when it came to
blender we saw a tangible improvement in
performance thanks to our better
thermals
which were much better than stock when
we removed the power limit we hit the
same temperature but our gold-plated CPU
remained at 5 gigahertz on all cores
with a Noctua Nhu 12s with a beefier
cooler we could do 5 gigahertz all day
long so even after running for 10
minutes our thermal results are still
looking great which means the last
before and after
is a good old-fashioned Cinebench run
while we wait for that to go I should
probably say like in fairness to Intel
there's a lot of stuff that you have to
change in the manufacturing pipeline in
order to do something like gold plate a
heat spreader like the kind of
validation a company like this does I
mean let alone turning the substrate
black they'd have to do all kinds of
materials testing and science and stuff
in order to do that so I'm not giving
them too hard of a time but I also do
think they could do better and that's
the purpose of this video is hey come on
guys if we can do it then I think a
multi-billion dollar company can
probably do it too so our final result
is 1390 Sattar 1086 so wearable we have
lost no performance we have better
thermal results and presumably we'd be
able to overclock this damn thing now
probably at this point for kanae
speaking of things that are freaking a
our sponsor Optima Optima has designed a
bluetooth earbud that can withstand your
daily and exercise routines with the new
force B eSport 4 it utilizes a six
millimeter graphene driver diaphragm
which produces a crystal-clear sound the
spin fit twin blade ear tips with 360
degree rotation allow them to state in
your ears and also enhance its noise
isolation and it's got a water-resistant
IP x5 rating the inline mic and audio
controls not only allow you to take
calls and adjust volume but you can even
summon the Google assistant or Siri and
they're available on Amazon today at the
link in the video description for just
79 bucks so go check them out so thanks
for watching guys if you liked this
video you can hit that button I mean if
you just liked it I guess there's the
