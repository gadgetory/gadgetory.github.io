2013 is powered by western digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys so we came across
the galaxy booth and I was reminded of
something as a reminder that they do a
lot of white PCBs on the graphics cards
and nowadays especially with our force
we've been seeing a ton of black and
white themed builds in our build log
section which is pretty representative
of how people are building performance
computers so I just wanted to show off
their 770 and 780 new Walt gtx 780 SOC
and galaxy gtx 770 two gigabyte SOC
white editions they both have white PCBs
they both have white themed colors on
the rest of the card and they both look
awesome you can see some massive massive
copper heatpipes on the top of the 780 I
don't know if we will can actually see
that and as I can't get into the glass I
can't move it but they're massive trust
me just tons of fans on the 772 big fans
on 780 ye pcbs very very clean I'm not
going to bore you with the stock of
settings of a 717 780 if you want to
figure those out please check out our
other videos on both of those cards I
also just want to do really quick thing
about their Hall of Fame motherboard if
you want to look like a king probably
get this as there's a crown on your
motherboard what else could you possibly
want other than a crown on your
motherboard they also support for way
16x sli or crossfire and this thing is
pretty beast you got 28 pin motherboard
power connectors to add all that extra
power tons of fan connectors we got some
right angle fan connectors over there
which are very very cool and other than
that we're just going to move on so
thank you for watching our galaxy
