growing up she said stand up straight if
you have nothing nice to say don't say
nothing at all and never kick him while
they're down but uh I don't see my mama
do you and that is why today's video is
going to be about Walmart's overpowered
15.6 inch gaming laptop could it
possibly be as bad as their desktop well
there's only one way to find out isn't
there and this video is sponsored by el
gato the stream deck mini has six fully
customizable LCD buttons with
easy-to-use programming software check
it out at Amazon or Newegg at the link
below
all right so my idea is we crack the
books open see you know if it go then
you think epic overpowered maybe hold on
okay I gotta get serious what
so spec wise we're looking at a core i7
87 58 of the six core processor gtx 1066
gig 16 gigs of ram 256 gig SSD 1
terabyte hard drive
144 hertz 1080p display RGB backlit
mechanical keyboard and Windows 10 I
mean on paper like specifically this
paper right here this ticks pretty much
all the boxes with the only issue being
the price so we ordered this actually at
around the same time that we ordered our
desktop but it didn't arrive until quite
recently because they screwed up our
order and when we went to pick it up the
laptop just wasn't there with our order
and it was only because we checked
before we left the store we did in-store
pickup that we were able to point out
that hey the $1,400 laptop we ordered
ate here dawg so it comes with an
external power brick that's kind of big
but also not too thick so I guess that's
nice a QuickStart guide a connect AC
adapters Jack into other more different
Jack B the display panel can be opened
to a wide range of angles for optimal
viewing C press the power button
all right so this laptop actually
arrived in sysprep mode and there was no
bloatware installed whatsoever same as
with the desktop really so they've got
their control center but that's it that
is the most hilarious animation look at
it but game who thinks that's a good
idea I mean it's the same kind of thing
you'd have with a normal program they
just it doesn't have like an
acceleration curve it's just like for
those who don't know it's called
disruptive innovation okay so you just
got disrupted so in the opie control
center you can turn on and off your LED
light bar which is right here it's RGB
you can turn on and off your keyboard
backlight you can well you can turn off
the internal display oh crap now what
you can do a bunch of different keyboard
effects you can alter your fan settings
so office mode or gaming mode it was in
gaming mode by default there's also a
turbo mode whoa you know as far as
system bloat goes this is really not bad
however as not bad as it might be this
is just a skin what is this what are
they doing there's no way that that is
not programmed in so what was what was
the intent yeah
destructive innovation I told you Oh
peel ejected one can say that he
appealed was not too appealing one can
but one shouldn't okay what does this
mean
tap tap twice hey there's a little light
in the touchpad so when you tap this
corner twice it enables or disables the
touchpad so to Walmart's credit here
there actually are a fair number of
features you know whether you buy into
the RGB hype or not that are
specifically tailored
to gamers as for the overall sort of
build quality the machine I would
describe it just from sort of a fit and
finish standpoint here as average at
best but certainly not the worst thing
I've ever seen and spec wise but 144
Hertz display is not immediately
disappointing to me not super-bright or
anything but it's not super dim either
like nope okay stop that hey stop that
so moving stuff around quickly on-screen
there's pretty good clarity even during
fast movement so yeah it's not a CRT or
anything but for an IPS panel that's not
bad what do you think of the mechanical
keyboard you know it has a mechanical
keyboard according to the specs oh oh oh
that's stupid so the old peak Control
Center is not tied into the keyboard
brightness adjustment over here so if
you turn it off that is so cringe to see
if it's actually mechanical we actually
pried one of the key caps off here and
yeah it does appear to be so we've got
our metal contact piece here that seems
to be what makes the key itself actuate
so it actually does actuate before it
bottoms out but the issue is that it's
almost like they implemented this
feature without a clear understanding of
why or what it is about mechanical
keyboards that makes them good for
gaming because we've got kind of a very
heavy feel towards the top of the key
press and then they're quite mushy after
that so there's no real clear advantage
over just a short travel scissor switch
for example how do you feel about the
numpad I think it's a little too cramped
so I like that they're using all the
space that they have here for keyboard
like they're going almost edge to edge
keyboard which is nice like the keys are
quite big but I I kind of questioned the
wisdom actually not just to this one but
of our other contestants as well of
including a numpad
a gaming laptop like what do you plan it
like an accounting simulator like EVE
Online okay that's what I said hey hey
so for IO we've got USB to Ethernet
audio dedicated microphone jack that's
kind of nice to see over here we've got
two USB 3 s an SD card reader and then
oh wow that's not bad
a USB type-c which is over with our
display outputs HDMI and then two mini
display ports that I guess is because
they figure people will use it as a
display out more than as just a USB port
that's sort of an interesting thought
and actually a lot of ventilation heat
sinks here here here and here and then
basically just wide open mesh across the
bottom but it still actually has a
reasonable amount of structural rigidity
down here it's not bad you could crack
it open all right sue Minter we can put
the thing back together
should be fine do we have a parts tray
or anything that we can kind of use as a
proxy - what so I thought we were ready
to go but they've got a warranty void if
remove sticker Oh what shall we address
the so it uses a similar approach to the
LG gram now with LG they were saving
weight by using a main board and then
daughter boards with these ribbon cables
connecting them but whether it was a
cost or weight savings they've ended up
with a really interesting internal
layout so without increasing the
thickness of the device it makes extra
room for higher profile like thicker
cooling fans and heat sinks and stuff
like that because they're not fighting
with the PCB for space and then we get a
similar effect over here for MDOT to
drive now it should be noted that this
is not an nvme SSD so this is just a
regular SATA SSD just in an MDOT two
form factor you can see though if you
wanted you could put a PCIe one here or
you could put a second piece yet you one
here but not another say - MDOT - it's
why you got to watch out for this
compatibility they could have just
expanded the battery capacity because
this is pretty kinky you know and that
is actually a perfect segue into how
exactly it is that Walmart best known
for good prices on you know bathroom
paper got into the laptop manufacturing
business I thought and I would have I
would have put money on it that what
they had done was rebranded a laptop
unit from the company clavo who was well
known for supplying other brands with
their manufactured laptops but I was
wrong so to whom do the we owe the
pleasure of inspecting this laptop well
I'm putting it back together here this
is the ODM known as tong Fang Tong sang
I've never even heard of them neither
have I up until one two days ago and
apparently turkish reseller monster
sells
laptops based on this exact bear bone
which is known as gamma kilo 5 charlie
noob 6 is xaviar am i supposed to have
heard of that like is that supposed to
add credibility or wants to does the
fact that Origin PC use the same C I had
thought that Origen just used clever
like I thought everyone just used clavo
to be perfectly honest I wasn't aware of
these guys at all like Sager eurocom
Origen I thought it was just all clever
rebrands but then there's this sorry
what are they called again don't know
pain
Tong Fang company that I've hardly ever
heard of I say hardly because I have
technically heard of them in the last
three minutes here so here's the thing
this approach of basically rebranding
what someone else has already built has
advantages like allowing a company like
Walmart who has no experience whatsoever
designing computers to just jump right
into the market with a product that
might have some flaws like this keyboard
is very imperfect but is otherwise
balanced ly SPECT and very functional
the disadvantage is that it's hard to
differentiate yourself so Ivan mentioned
that Origin PC also sells this model can
you spec out an identical config to this
on Origin
and how much does that cost us bear in
mind we paid fourteen hundred US dollars
for this now based on our previous
experience where by you know dealing
with origin PC you know that $1500
gaming system that they sent us not
guess how much this conflict would cost
origin PC specs out to be pretty much
same as this - one terabyte how much
$1400 so identical to what Walmart was
charging except that with origin you get
to have origins customer service which
in secret shopper we have established it
was at least sample size of - I guess
but was excellent and you'll have the
confidence that down the line if you
need help with your system origin PC
will probably still be in the PC
business whereas with Walmart I'm not
sure if that's so clear either way
origin did not score well in value which
leads us to the question is origin going
aggressive on their laptop pricing or is
Walmart enjoying origin like markups yes
well yeah it has to be one of them that
you've probably been asking yourself why
do you have these other laptops on the
table you'd be asking yourself a good
question so when we bought it
this was $1400 but in the time that it's
been sitting on our shelf Walmart
implemented a roll back to only eight
hundred US dollars for this thing so
over here we've got an $800 Nitro 5 from
Acer rocking a core i5 8th gen and a gtx
1050 TI and then over here representing
the $1400 price point we've got an asus
rog i think this is a scar or something
it's a last gen processor but in terms
of gaming performance it should be quite
similar and the GPU is a gtx 1060 so in
Cinebench or whatever it won't perform
as well as the current gen version of
this but in games it should be basically
identical so let's go ahead and fire up
our stress test here and make sure that
you know there's not any egregious
thermal throttling issues or anything
like that were you expecting this to be
clocked like 300 400 mega her
slower than the Asus model according to
what I research in Prior this laptop
does have thermal throttling issues runs
hot but we cannot hear it at all perhaps
is because you set it into like desktop
mode in I didn't be the center oh I was
on battery well wait so that means then
any way that a Seuss's on battery
performance profile is much more
aggressive I'm still in better yeah
let's take a look how much battery is
left because they were only before the
same time an hour and 14 minutes 60
percent remaining 38 percent remaining
so they're both terrible oh there we go
150 165 fps so they've been running long
enough to reach equilibrium now bottom
line is this guy clocks in anywhere from
80 to a hundred megahertz slower than
this one and the performance cap reason
given by GPU Z is power for both of them
but our over powered laptop hits this
cap more frequently they're both around
the same temperature with this one
coming in at around 71 degrees we have
to stop it for a second here because I
had a microphone issue don't worry about
it anyway 71 degrees and this one at 74
with the over powered being about as
loud maybe a touch louder let's see how
it goes in actual games though so
performance wise
it is already falling behind the Asus
machine but by like 2 to 4 FPS here and
there and it is way ahead not just in
terms of fps but also just in terms of
playability like with how dark this
display is it's really hard to make out
details in the shadows and there goes
the power outage that we were sure was
probably coming at some point today oh
boy
winds peaking at a hundred kilometers an
hour
blasting trees and knocking down power
lines a houseboat adrift after being
torn from its moorings BC Hydro warning
that some homes and businesses may not
get their power back for days so I'm
gonna make my best attempt at an Ivan
joke so you might say that the laptop
was so opie that the power went out no I
would usually kick you into like you
know this laptop was so full of a penis
so we had to throw out the results we
were getting last time because they all
switched to battery power in the middle
of the run we'll be back with you in a
moment here so this is interesting
our similarly priced nitro 5 comes in at
just 2/3 the average frame rate of our
overpowered machine and with other
significant well disadvantages as well
including a weaker CPU as well as a
worse screen but then moving up into the
original pricing of our overpowered well
it wasn't really that competitive
because due to the faster clock speed of
our GPU over here we still ended up with
higher frame rates even though this one
has an inferior CPU so this one is I
think the official MSRP is actually 1600
but you can find it for about 1400 on
Amazon just to validate what I was
saying before we popped out of the game
and had a look at what core clocks we
were running at during the benchmark and
yes in fact the overpowered machine is
running at anywhere from 50 to about 80
megahertz slower on the GPU in actual
games last result just came in for Deus
Ex mankind divided and this is
interesting so average frame rates again
our $800 machine like true $800 machines
way slower than our rolled back $800
machine and that one it falls a little
bit behind de Souza's particularly in
the minimum frame rates interesting
let's do one more game
so I'm sitting in the 130 140 FPS range
what are you sitting at right now
160 150 160 so when we're running into a
CPU bottleneck we can see here that our
core i5 8th gen is actually not that far
behind so we're running at 1080p and all
high with 16x anisotropic filtering so
ok so only about 20 fps difference now
let's take our 2 $1400 gaming laptops
man that high refresh rate display makes
a big difference holy crap so not only
am i lower than last time but the Asus
machine is absolutely crushing it it's
well over 200 frames per second 240
let's hear that me spend the same spot
it's like 80 FPS higher did you know
this was gonna happen
nope so there's clearly some power
management or some kind of profile issue
going on here so here I'm not gonna have
a task manager running in the background
let's make sure that you don't have
extra background crap running how will
we know life isn't it kind of well I
just want to know what the frame rate is
cuz honestly that's when I do you think
effect think not much but it's a little
bit I think it can use a couple percent
yeah but not to know this is like I tell
you what this both have it open here
fine what's sucking up all my memories
csgo is using one point three only that
doesn't even make any sense
I know what it is no it's not what the
hell
okay well then goes family your thumb
yeah but they're both single channel and
this one's running faster that's only
2400 megahertz what is going on here
okay let's just go ahead and lunch the
game so let's make sure we're running
the same settings though okay it's all
the same so let's go back let's try
again snowballs
so I'm back up to like 160 like we had
on our first run I just I mean I also
want to just kind of feel the experience
because to be clear even if it runs at a
lower frame rate than that one it's only
got a 144 Hertz display like it's so I'm
still at 130 140 150 90 180 down but I'm
getting shot and you're at really okay
so why don't we stand here and smoke
this doorway so I'm at 140 and you're at
170 honestly I think we're ready to draw
the conclusion at this point compared to
another $1400 laptop with some of the
weirdness that we've encountered I
wouldn't take the overpowered with the
keyboard being honestly the biggest
issue for me personally because I do do
a lot of typing with that said compared
to an $800 laptop this is crazy because
I am about to recommend a Walmart opie
gaming device because compared to what
you get for 800 bucks this absolutely
mops the floor with it both in terms of
the features like the 144 Hertz display
and in terms of the performance at
anywhere from nearly double to about 50%
better so that just happened that just
happened right now but only because they
rolled back the pricing so you heard it
here first folks get them while they're
hot and then otherwise don't don't get
them don't get them when they're not hot
and on sale speaking of hot this video
is brought to you by our hot sponsor
your favorite eat a letter oh yeah

business owner or anyone else who just
like needs electronic stuff from time to
time Memex is the place to go in canada

great chance that they've got it in
store and with their uber price beat
guarantee they'll beat the price of any
