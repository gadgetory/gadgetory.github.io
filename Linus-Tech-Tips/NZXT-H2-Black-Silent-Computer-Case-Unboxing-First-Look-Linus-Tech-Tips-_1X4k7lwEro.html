couple of different colors today we are
going to be on actually I don't know
which ones inside here so I guess oh oh
here we go on the side yes we are going
to be unboxing the black version but it
is available in black and white so why
don't we have a look at the overall
specs for this case right off the bat so
it has three five and a quarter inch
external base eight three and a half
inch internal base seven expansion slots
it includes two 120 millimeter cooling
fans one at the front one at the back it
also supports a 140 in the top and a 120
at the bottom VGA support is up to just
over 12 inches without the hard drives
and 270 millimeters with a hard drive so
would that be about 11 inches 10 and a
half something along those lines
okay wiring space that's a good that's a
good spec to have because basically NZXT
has taken into consideration how much
wiring space you might need at the back
of the chassis and put in lots so that
you will be able to run all of your
cables to actually use the cable
management features that they have built
in it's made of plastic with aluminum
plastic / aluminum yes with aluminum
finishing material is steel of black
coating total weight you probably don't
care too much you you sb3 exciting all
right what do we got here touch powered
fans these are neat I'll show you that
later okay 30 watt 3 3 step fan control
this is a big thing that I love about
NZXT chassis they built in they build in
these fan controllers so you've got 40%
78 percent and 100 percent fan speed
controller 30 watt 3 step I'm not sure
how many fans it supports but we'll find
that out shortly top hot-swap capable
SATA hard drive dock which is we've seen
this before but what we haven't seen
before is a stealth one so we'll show
you that in a minute as well eight
front-facing hard drive to optimal
airflow noise dampening foam in top
magnetic fan cover for minimal PC noise
okay we'll show you that as well and
finally ample 25 speeds behind the
motherboard tray for cable management
what else we got on the outside that's
it that's all the very plain box which
is fine I would rather see companies
spending well because I work at an e
tailor we don't really have
as many retail stores as we sell stuff
online and the xt is a great online
shopping experience and for an online
shopping experience you do not need a
fancy retail box so I would much rather
see a higher quality product or better
packing or whatever else then then a
fancy shiny retail box which I mean you
know what annex an expensive box like a
really nice retail box can cost you you
know in the neighborhood of five bucks
so don't underestimate how much it cost
to have that to a product all right we
got Holmes packing material you can see
we've got about an inch of packing
material on all sides so that should
keep it nice and safe this is not my
favorite kind of packing material
because it is the the breakable stuff so
it'll only really take it's kind of like
a helmet
it'll only really take an impact once or
twice and then you should pretty much
replace it
I like the soft clothes cell phone but
it is definitely acceptable to get a
chassis this size from its source to its
dust
in one piece which we will verify in a
moment because this one has clearly
traveled from some kind of origin to
some kind of me and there it is
the h2 so why don't we start with the
aesthetics in our outside unboxing today
so at the front we see a very plain very
slick looking
external exterior okay we've got a
chrome finish around the outside plastic
bezel around the very very outside and
then a brushed aluminum finish here you
can see it's got a small accent that
breaks up the squareness of the front
down here where it dips into a little
corner okay and we're going to just go
ahead and open that up so it looks like
yeah this is magnetized I really like
that because latches break magnets
pretty much and don't they they just
kind of work on the inside you can see
the magnets here you can see these
screws that make up the construction of
the front panel very nice you can also
see the foam that is part of the noise
dampening features of this chassis you
can see the tool lists three and a half
five and a quarter inch bay covers which
can be removed and put in just like that
pull on that there and you can see it's
already open okay next you can look if
you don't drop it inside and ruin
everything
okay there we go you can also see this
as a cool feature
so these fans if the case was powered on
would obviously be on check this out so
ncx tea has done away with the concept
of running fan wires around new chassis
by building in power here so you
actually plug power into what is
essentially like a fan backplane you can
plug any fan you want in and then all
you do is slide it into place and it'll
start spinning so if there's no power
which is caused by disconnecting it here
and losing the contact at these
powerpoints or you can see you can plug
in any fan as long as you shorten the
cable enough to plug into here and then
you just go like this and boom it's on
just like that really cool feature so
the other front 120 millimeter fan does
that as well we can take these out and
then once we've removed these we
actually have access to install up to
eight three and a half inch hard drives
or two and a half inch SSDs or hard
drives if you really want to but I don't
need to the point so you can see here
these are two lists as well so you just
pop these back a little bit install your
drive and slide it in to the half inch
drives are mounted via the holes on the
bottom of the drive so just like that
feels pretty solid overall as soon as
you put a drive in a mechanism like this
it's going to gain a lot more rigidity
so that is something to bear in mind now
the tuna 1/2 inch drives won't help with
the rigidity factor but they're also not
having to worry about flying around
inside your case you got a little foot
here which has their NZXT branding on it
very tastefully finished as well in kind
of a gunmetal grey alright I think
that's pretty much it for the front of
the case let's move up to the top
because that's where some of the other
interesting stuff is here's our power
switch here's our reset switch here is
our fan speed controller which is a
switch style fan speed controller we
have front headphones front microphone
one front USB 3.0 or you can probably
wire it up as 2.0 as well if you feel
like it three front USB 2.0 so total a
four front USB in here you find that hot
swappable bake so all you have to do is
put in a three and a half inch or
a half-inch drive you go ahead and
stealth that back up and it doesn't
disrupt the look at your case like I
said we've seen this feature in the past
but we haven't seen it implemented in a
way that doesn't seriously detract from
the appearance of the top of the chassis
it's gonna go ahead and put that back on
there and then finally we've got a
magnetic cover for the top 140
millimeter fan should you choose to
install it so you just go like that and
position it where it goes which I don't
remember where it goes I guess it goes
right about there and there's actually
yeah okay you've got a little bit of
clearance in the back here so I'm just
gonna go ahead and tip the chassis
towards the cameraman so he can see it
so you can stealth the fan and you can
have like it's gonna be quite a
restricted exhaust or you can take it
off and you can leave it open which also
looks fairly slick it's a little bit
clumsy to position but since you
probably won't be doing it very often I
wouldn't worry too much
there you go down to the right spot
about that so the side panels we're just
gonna show you very briefly very plain
very black you've got the one small
accent here where you've got that
gunmetal gray piece along the bottom so
it kind of makes the chassis look like
it has a bit of a foot which is kind of
nice on the other side same thing okay
so this is a silence optimized chassis
it's not about necessarily putting dual
GTX 590 s in it so you don't have any
side panel intake fans for video cards
which is fine because it's all about
building the right thing for the purpose
you are trying to
and you don't necessarily want to go and
put a bunch of random fan holes into a
chassis that's all about silence because
you shouldn't be loading it up with
hands okay let's just take off please
have a look at the back so at the back
it's a white and black fan which matches
the overall look of the chassis itself
we've got our standard i/o shield I'll
shield cut out we have seven PCI
expansion slots to water cooling tubing
grommets should you decide to use an
external water cooling setup some
ventilation holes here as well as room
for a standard ATX power supply this has
all eight mounting holes so you can
mount your power supply either facing
with the pen down I'll actually do I
shouldn't take off the side panel just
yet either with the fan facing down into
the filtered intake or with the fan up
if you wanted to draw in hot air from
the video card so when we take the side
panel off we find more noise dampening
foam
it's glued on quite securely for those
of you who are wondering all right I'm
just gonna take off the other side panel
here just so that we can see all of the
internal goodies that are in this case
alright so the first thing here is
accessories let's see what we've got
included for mounting hardware and
whatnot
alright so we have a manual we have a
speaker we have some black cable ties we
also have a whole lot of mounting screws
and yeah more mounting screws
lots of mounting screws so in case you
were lacking mounting screws now you
have lots ok motherboard tray let's
start with that we've got a cutout here
for CPU coolers that require a backplate
so you don't have to take your
motherboard out install it and put it
back in which is a real hassle you can
just install it from the back by
removing the back side panel all of the
internal cables are black which I really
like to see really nice okay so here is
power for the front fans as well as
power for the fan controller up at the
top of the case it looks like the fan
controller supports one hmm
how many does it support two three leads
probably Oh probably four there's
probably run one running to the back fan
as well let me just see where that is
they've actually here this is kind of
the neat come around to the back I think
it supports four but here comes the back
okay so you can see that they've
actually cable tied all of the wiring in
place for you right off the bat so we
support one two three four Wow looks
like five fans you know what if anyone
knows for sure post it everyone thumbs
it up because I can't
follow all the leads right back to the
fan controller and find out where
they're coming from necessarily okay
they've also pre cable managed the oh
you know what let's look at the back
over here
so cable management holes are done via
the rubber grommets here here and here
all along the back so you can run the
cables up from your power supply to
wherever they need to go without being
able to see them you can also see the
two and a half centimeters of clearance
at the back of the us at the back of the
motherboard tray which is enough to run
a 24-pin connector you'd be amazed how
many chassis makers make that mistake so
that you actually can't run it out here
bend it because remember that's a lot
more than just the thickness of the
cable once you try and bend it and run
it up to where it needs to go you've
also got these little hooks right here
for zip ties which are very handy for
keeping everything flat at the back and
we can put screws in in addition to the
tool list mount for our five and a
quarter inch base so speaking of the
five and a quarter inch bays here's the
tool if mount I've seen this one before
and I'm a big fan okay so it locks
somehow or other I can't remember yeah
there we go
so you put it out like that lock it in
like that doesn't come out anymore I
like it it just looks neat it's like
little like caterpillar okay we've got
screw storage all along the side of the
case here okay
there's our three five and a quarter
inch base nothing except still there
there's the eight three and a half inch
base which we saw before down here we
have our extra 120 millimeter fan mount
so that's four more intake should you so
desire we have support for very long
power supplies you can put in pretty
much whatever you want as well as rubber
grommets here at the bottom of the case
to lift it a little bit up so that you
aren't gonna have any restriction when
you're pulling air in from the bottom of
the case okay
we've also got our front USB three is
hooked up via the outside so you can see
there's a hole here at the back so that
will plug into the back of your
motherboard and it's not the most
elegant solution but it's also not the
end of the world because it took
everyone forever to decide on a standard
four in
usb3 here's all the front cables
including USB to another USB 2 HD audio
as well as all your front switches and
LEDs and I think that pretty much covers
everything I wanted to say about the h2
