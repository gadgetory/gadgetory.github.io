Canadian exclusive for the time being
for NCIX we've got the aspire Revo in
stock right now so we wanted to talk
about this unit a little bit first of
all we've got the the specs here so you
can see it comes with Windows Vista
Intel Atom dual core processor 2 gigs
RAM 160 gig hard drive wireless wireless
keyboard wireless mouse the coolest
thing about this though is the Nvidia
ion integrated graphics so what that
means is we're using an Nvidia chipset
and we have Nvidia onboard video so if I
could just get this to open that would
be ouch very helpful so what that means
is that you've got hardware decoding
available on the GPU itself or blu-ray
or other HD content now you can't
necessarily play right off a blu-ray
disc because it doesn't have a blu-ray
drive or a place to put a drive but the
Revo is a new sort of class of computer
called a net talk so we're gonna show
this closing form factor in just a
minute here ok yeah that can go away
soon as we get the blocks open so here
we go inside we've got ya how do you use
your wireless keyboard and mouse the
warranty how to mount your net top to
the back of a monitor that's actually
kind of cool so you can use a VESA mount
with the included mounting bracket to
mount it to the back of a monitor here's
a little guide your new Revo all the
stuff we'll talk about this later so
don't worry about it ok here we go let's
get to the to the guts of this we've got
the Revo itself so we'll get this taken
out so you can see the finish on it is
actually I'm just gonna cover up this
Windows key because I don't know if
people can steal that so you can see the
finish on it is like a glossy black
shiny sort of sparkly finish it looks
really gorgeous so we're gonna try to
remove
oh that's really hard okay there we go
so you got your Easter logo so then on
the back you've got your power in VGA
out HDMI out now this is the big one cuz
that's what you're gonna want to use for
your digital content Gigabit Ethernet
for USB and then on the front you've got
eSATA audio ports SD card slot or MMC
and then on the top you've got one more
USB port and there it is the Nvidia ion
logo so that is the Revo itself quite
small very cool so then let's see what
else we've got four accessories you've
got your wireless mouse which is looks
functional that's nothing too
exceptional about it and it comes with
batteries of course so then you've got
your power cord power brick is in here
then next some silica gel don't eat this
and then hang on let's get this out of
here ok so you've got the little stand
this is probably how most people are
gonna mount their Revo right on wow it's
pulling everything over the place so
this is how you would normally mount the
Revo but then also inside you've got the
the VESA mount if you put it on the back
of your monitor and then this is kind of
a weird looking thing
USB okay hold on a second USB webcam
there you go so you can look it up or
down it comes with a webcam very cool
hello there let's see what else we got
hey and last but not least we have the
wireless keyboard that comes with the
Revo kind of shiny standard layout
nothing particularly exceptional about
it so it comes with everything you need
out of the box except a monitor
thank you for checking out my blog the
unboxing of the Acer Aspire Revo</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
