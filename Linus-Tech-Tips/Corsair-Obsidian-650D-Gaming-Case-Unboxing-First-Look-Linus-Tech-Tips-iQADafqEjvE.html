plastic covering bits so there were a
few different ones first of all there's
one holding the front bezel on because
you can actually well my assumption is
that you can actually pop that off but
we'll figure that out later
there was one holding this this piece
closed that was pretty much it for tape
so let's start at the front so at the
front we see just like the 800 D we've
got all of our front panel connectors
where are you down there we've got all
of our front panel connectors as well as
our start and power LED reset switch all
of that good stuff
is up here I'm not sure where that other
front USB 2.0 is I wonder if they mean
either for USB 2.0 or 2 USB 3 to this B
2
either way it's no no major loss I mean
you only need so many front USB so the
overall fit and finish of the front
bezel looks very very similar to the 800
D very nice quality very nice quality
piece here ok so let's move around to
let's go to this side okay so we got a
window which has kind of a frame around
it okay gives it a very clean look the
side panel is toolless so you got to do
is hold down these little latches here
you can open and close it that way let's
move around to the back where we will
find 8 expansion slots a 120 millimeter
exhaust fan or i/o slot as well as a
bottom mounted power supply and a bottom
mounted fan filter just like the 800 D
except shorter and narrower all right
then on the other side you're going to
actually we're going to take this one
right off I'm going to show you guys the
overall look of the side panel so the
side panels are quite stiff not a whole
lot of flex to them you can see this
mechanism here looks quite robust so
you're not going to worry too much about
that breaking over extended use all
right inside is all black as we've come
to expect from Corsair cases you can see
it has a huge CPU cutout so you're going
to be able to access the back of your
motherboard however and from whatever
angle it is that you need to do that
from okay let's finish up with the
cooling first so up here on the top you
can see we've actually got a lot of
different fan
mounting options so it comes with a 200
millimeter fan but you can also mount to
140 s using these holes or to 120 s
using haveno wet holes but you can do to
120 s or to 140 s or a single 200
millimeter okay let's go ahead and take
the side panel off show you guys inside
of the window so that's it fixed with
screws and it's just a piece of some
kind of acrylic or plexi something like
that okay the internal feel note one
last external feature they did want to
show you guys actually if fine we can
look at this now so here in the front
we've got our course our logo and we've
also got our other 200 millimeter fan
and in terms of mounting options it
looks like a 200 millimeter fan is all
that goes there and you do not have the
option to mount something else like you
do in the top okay one last external
feature up here on the top you can see
right here gives us a guide so if you
want to install a three and a half inch
hot-swap drive you can do that and it'll
just push it down and if you want to
install a two and a half inch hots log
drive then it'll guide it into the
correct position so then you can swap it
like it's hot it's crazy Russian wanted
me to say that he's filming this for me
and cameraman stead cameraman is
actually on vacation right now I can't
get it out oh oh here hold on we've also
got our fan speed controller in here I
didn't even see that little switch so we
basically got low medium and high I'm
gonna pull that out okay there good
excellent close all right let's have a
look at the inside internal features
we've got our motherboard tray which is
apparently designed by Corsair much like
the rest of the case the grommets used
here are I'd say they're a little
stiffer than some of the some of the
well the most flexible ones that I've
seen but you can clearly see that if you
put something in put some pressure on it
and withdraw it you're still going to
they're still going to come back to
their original position so nice
high-quality grommets the power supply
mount is raised up a little bit off the
bottom of the case honestly it's pretty
much irrelevant because you've got this
ventilation
as well as this filtered intake so you
can mount your power supply no matter
what power supply you're using no
problem fan side down so it can draw a
nice fresh air filtered air through the
bottom of the case what else do we got
in here here you can see the inside of
the two hundred millimeter fan that's
included okay
then we've also got a 120 millimeter fan
at the back which wasn't mentioned
actually on the outside of the box but I
mean I can't imagine course they're
releasing a case without a 120
millimeter fan given that there are
water cooling solutions all rely on 120
millimeter fans so that wouldn't make
any sense at all would it we've also got
speaking of water cooling a couple of
water cooling grommets so if you wanted
to do an external mounted rad you could
run the tubing through there as I
mentioned before at the back eight
internal PCI Express brackets so that
gives you a couple options you could
install a motherboard with eight PC our
des a PCI Express I guess I meant PCI
but either is fine so you can either
install a motherboard with eight PCI
slots at the back or you can install a
motherboard with seven and a PCIe 16x
slot at the bottom and then you can
install a graphics card that is dual
slot in there and it will still have
room to exhaust alright got tons and
tons of cable management grommets
including gaps at the top here and more
importantly here to bring through the
eight pin or four pin CPU power
connector or connect doors that we got
here in terms of internal connectors
speaking of connectors all right we've
got a ziploc bag
which has a corsair sticker in all
likelihood although I don't see it some
rubber grommets some screws and zip ties
okay here is all about wow that's a
whack of internal cables okay so I'm
just going to try and find out how to
take this off come on oh I see it's
probably affixed from the back yes yes
it is that took me way too long to
figure out okay
there we go so this this is like water
cables it's a good thing coarser makes
all other cables black otherwise
managing all of this plus power supply
plus whatever the heck else data cables
you need would be a mess okay so back
here we've got our firewire we've got
our HD audio we've got our USB - we've
got our USB three you can see the way
the USB 3 works is via the running out
the back of the case and plugging into
the back of the i/o shield although I
would expect adapters to be available
fairly shortly so that you can use those
brand-new fancy internal headers with
your brand-new fancy case alright so
that's all of that and then we've got
fan connector okay note we've got our
front panel so that's our power switch
LEDs reset switch all that good stuff
and then we have FATA connectors so
here's the power for the fan controller
that we saw with that switch up at the
top and then you can plug up to four
fans directly into it and control all
four fans so the for fans they intend
for you to use are the 200ml at the
front a 120 mil at the back and then up
to two 140 s or two 120 s at the top we
have a two list mechanism here for the
drive cages so it's just a simple rocker
one so all you have to do is push that
in well pull it out put in your drive
push it in okay
fairly straightforward and here we have
two less hard drive trays so they've got
two and a half inch mounting holes here
and then three and a half inch drives
are going to be mounted via the pegs
here they look flimsy but as soon as you
put a drive in them and snap them in I
guarantee you they're not going anywhere
now one of these cages is actually
removable actually these cages are
removable and I believe they can
actually be rotated but don't quote me
on that one yet we will find out maybe
it's just one of them that can be
rotated here we go thumb screws handy
love the thumb screws okay so that did
that and then
okay give me a moment here yes okay I
was mistaken it looks like what this
feature is actually for is to remove the
hard drive cages which clearly we have
done and then you can I guess you can
access this fan to clean it for whatever
reason or whatever but what it's also
for is installing very very very long
graphics cards so Corsair has left
enough room for graphics cards to become
pretty much double the length of a
motherboard and you will still be able
to install them in the 650d without any
difficulty whatsoever okay the last
thing we're going to show you guys in
our unboxing and preview or whatever you
want to call it first look that's what I
usually call it is how to remove the
front bezel so all you got to do is pull
up these tasks and remove the front
bezel so front bezel from the inside you
can see it has a metal metal sheath
outside of it but the inside is actually
plastic we've got our fan filter here
which is or is not removable it's gotta
be it's gotta be removable
yes it's removable there you go there's
your front fan filter and it is
removable
maybe that's what crazy Russian was
trying to show me earlier okay and then
from the front you can I don't know
install drives see fans uninstall this
fan potentially thank you for checking
out my video on the Corsair I'll post
this here yeah that looks good it's not
going to stay now stay on the Corsair
