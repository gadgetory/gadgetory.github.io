however many weeks but i would give away
a six gig kit of kingston hyperx ddr3
1600 ram
and I am finally giving it
I used random.org to pick one person out
of all of the over 2,500 people who left
a comment under the video and we ended
up with X crazy and I think he means
crazy but he has said that he deserves
this Ram because he's going to use it to
fight off evil and save this planet plus
he really likes shiny sparkly pink so we
checked out his channel and he is
subscribed almost exclusively so
two-thirds of his subscriptions are to
my channels so I definitely approve of
that and I also approve of the video
that has one video upload which is a dog
eating a watermelon and it is available
at HD should you desire to watch it but
yeah his name is X crazy ex kraz said
why and you are the big winner so just
send me a message on YouTube at Linus
tech tips and I'll arrange to get your
ram chip to you congratulations and
thank you everyone for participating but
wait there's more hold on hold on i'm
actually going to announce our next
giveaway but this isn't going to be the
video where i actually give it away if I
can find it oh is this it looks like it
yes we are giving away a 128 gig
kingston SSD so if you are not already
subscribed even if you missed out on
this one make sure you subscribe to
Linus tech tips as well as NCIX calm and
then you'll have a chance at this one
when we give it away probably in the
next month or so thank you very much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
