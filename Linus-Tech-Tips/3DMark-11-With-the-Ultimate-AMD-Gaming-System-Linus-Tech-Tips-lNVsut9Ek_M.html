little bit more testing on the AMD
ultimate machine build so I'm using it
with the six core 1100 t processor at
stocks beat this is all stock speeds so
anything you get from overclocking would
be would be extra I'm running 3dmark11
here and I'll show you guys a score once
it's finished but anyway I do have the
two radeon 6870 cards in there so those
are also both running at stock speeds
and I also want to show you guys in
addition to the 3dmark11 score I want to
show you guys what we get in terms of
power consumption under a full gaming
load with this machine as well as what
maximum temperatures we're going to see
in the 600 T so I'm going to close up
the case and run it a couple times to
let it heat up and we'll see what we get
here's our score with the ultimate AMD
system with only one of the 6870
graphics cards running so we're running
at the extreme preset which is 1080p
resolution all details etc etc so I'll
be right back in just a minute with
crossfire result so I promised I'd show
you guys the next temps of these 68 70 s
in the 600 t case so they both max out
around 80 degrees and that really speaks
to the the way the airflow is structured
in this case that both gpus actually run
at the same temperature that's pretty
cool because what that means is due to
the spacing of the crosshair for as well
as the air flow through the 600t you're
not actually getting that that air flow
restriction for the top part so both of
them are able to cool themselves
completely adequately so I've also got
our 3dmark11 crossfire score which is X
2652 and I think that's pretty much
everything I wanted to show you guys
this has been my 3dmark11 showcase with
our ultimate
d machine featuring the 1100 t6 core
processor and dual 6870 graphics don't
