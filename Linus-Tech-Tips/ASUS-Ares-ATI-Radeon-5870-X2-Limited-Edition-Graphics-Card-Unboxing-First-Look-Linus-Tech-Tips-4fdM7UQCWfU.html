to be taking a look at the assuit Aires
limited edition graphics card so only a
thousand of these were produced
worldwide and this is the Box like
seriously that is the box for one
graphics card it's like it looks like it
could contain a good sized gaming
notebook anyway we've already taken the
Ares a briefcase out of the box and this
is what it looks like so if you binaries
you will get something that looks like
this it looks like a briefcase full of
money it has a little ares logo on it
right here and it is lockable so if
you're transporting your video card and
it's not inside your system yet there's
actually a combination locks right here
so you can set two separate combinations
one for each side there they're set to 0
by default so that you can actually get
it open it comes with a little booklet
attached to the outside that says birth
of a legend talks about the the
packaging that they've that they've used
on this particular product to make it
really stand out makings of a beast so
they're saying that's gonna outperform
even the Radeon 59 70 by over 32% so
what the Ares does is instead of using
to cut down 5870 course it uses to
complete 5870 course a fully custom
cooler and we're gonna have a really
close look at the cooler it's just
outstanding and incredibly heavy and
that is how the Ares achieves this
fastest single graphics card performance
ever benchmark that it does ok so let's
have a look at what we have in terms of
accessories we have one crossfire bridge
we have two
PCI Express six pin dual six pin two
single eight pin adapters because this
card requires a lot of power connectors
next we've got a DVI to HDMI adapter
okay then we have a little Republic of
gamers case badge that you can put on
your case and finally we have anna soos
republic of gamers gaming mouse
it's a laser mouse we can tell because
it says class one laser product on the
bottom all right it's pretty
straightforward looking you got your
mouse wheel you got two side buttons
here you got a nice little rubberized
grip dpi switch anyway we are not here
to see the mouse we are here to see the
graphics card king of all graphics cards
right now oh there's a couple more
things holy cow it's heavy okay button
functions okay so there's a manual for
the mouse there's a driver for the mouse
here's a little Quick Start Guide and
here's how to operate the combination
locks there you go as well as a VGA
driver and manual don't use that
download the latest drivers if you're
not downloading the latest drivers for a
card like this you should probably be
smacked because yeah you just should
that's just how it works
okay so put those back in there and
let's have a look at the area so the
first thing you should probably notice
about this part it is is it is longer
taller and wider than most other
graphics cards on the market right now
in terms of outputs we've got our usual
suspects for in for ATI i finnaly so we
have there's a car alarm of all things
you got to just pause this for now and
we're back sorry about that
so we have two DVI HDMI so that means
you can hook up to normal DVI monitors
just using an adapter here and then we
have one DisplayPort port so will you
need to use an active adapter or a
DisplayPort monitor and all in order to
run three displays off this graphics
card we've got an empty slot here so
that some of the cooling capability of
this cooler is gonna be blown out the
back and the battery ran out so we're
gonna try this one more time we talked
about the connectors we talked about how
some of the heat is going to be
exhausted from the back let's talk about
this cooler a little bit because the
cooler on the Aries is completely 100%
custom so it starts in the middle with a
100 millimeter fan now this is not your
average VGA fan solution it uses an
extremely thick fan for high static
pressure so you can see how
forward-swept these
and how deep they go compared to a
typical VGA fan and what it needs that
for is in order to push air through
these dense copper thin arrangements
that are each okay each containing not
only the copper fin structure but for
eight millimeter heat pipes so there's
one of these coolers on each of the 5870
course on this graphics part so like I
said before it is more like a 58 70 X 2
and not like a 59 70 because a 59 70 has
two GPUs that are kind of like either a
cut-down 5870 or a beefed-up 5850 it's
somewhere in between no these are true
5870 cores and as such they have power
requirements that go a little bit beyond
what you'd find with a typical dual
graphics card solution so this card
takes one 6 pin PCI connector and two 8
pin PCIe connectors to run just one
aries card in your computer as soos
recommends a 750 watt power supply with
40 amps on the 12 volt rail that's to
run one I mean if you're even gonna have
three PCI Express connectors you better
have a dual graphics card ready power
supply in the first place
on the back of the card ins have a look
at the cooling once again this is a
thick aluminum plate that has little
ribs in it to get a little bit better
heat dissipation but basically you can
see this is incredibly fit compared to
the back plates that we typically see on
a graphics card and the reason for that
is that it has to cool the memory that
is located on the back of the card so
this card has four gigs of memory
compared to the snore the normal two
gigs on a 59 70 so that gives you double
the frame buffer now in terms of other
features to talk about oh yeah so I
mentioned that it was that it was longer
wider and taller than most graphics
cards so here just for comparison I have
another fairly
he graphics card with a fairly legit
looking cooler on it this is a GTX 480
and I just want to do a quick size
comparison so I'm gonna go ahead and put
down the Aries right here and I just
want to show you how big this graphics
part is compared to a typical one so
that is a standard height graphics card
so you can see that the crossfire
connector is located a good inch higher
than the PCI Express our PCI backplate
right here that means that this card is
significantly taller than most other
graphics cards on the mark in fact
almost all other graphics cards on the
market even with the heat pipes on the
GTX 480 that can cause clearance issues
with some cases it's significantly
shorter than the Aries now
that's something that you really want to
be aware of if you want to install one
of these cards you got to make sure that
your case is going to have enough room
for this graphics card another cool
feature I wanted to show you a soos does
support through software voltage
tweaking on this card so they are saying
that you can get dramatically better
performance when you overclock the aries
and this thing is designed from the
ground up to just pump voltage through
it to overclock the snot out of it
because if you're buying the ultimate
graphics card you better be getting the
ultimate performance so you can see not
only on the back but also on the front
we've got huge aluminum plates that
cover all of the heat producing
components other than the GPUs and the
voltage regulation here which is covered
by copper so you can see it goes down
there under the fan as well you've got
that ribbed aluminum heatsink and then
it comes all the way around see up here
on the top here it is got some more
little dots too to give you more heat
more surface area to dissipate heat and
then around here at the back as well so
this cooler is just a monster and like I
swear when I first picked up the card I
was I was just floored at how heavy it
was I mean compared to a GTX 480 which
is a heavy card with a big cooler it's
got four heat pipes five heat pipes
sorry etc etc I mean this weighs easily
double like double you
never want to ship your system with one
of these installed no way no how
along the lines of voltage tweaking if
you're doing actual voltage mods or if
you want to check them you can actually
use these contact points back here to
check your video card voltages for GPU 1
and GPU 2 so that's a pretty cool
feature we've seen this on motherboards
in the past but it's very very rare to
see a feature like that where you can
check your your video card voltages with
a multimeter so that's a pretty cool one
as well and I think we're getting pretty
close to the end I mean I I guess I can
say this will install in standard PCI
Express 2.0 16x motherboard slot so
that's something to be aware of although
I don't believe this meets PCI Express
specifications because of the power
consumption let me just have a look at
the box but I doubt there's a PCIe logo
anywhere on this box because the PCI
Express standard calls for only a
certain amount of power being pulled
through the slot and through the PCI
Express connector so yep this is one
beefy card and it is not not within the
standard but that's the price you pay Oh
last thing in terms of size so I showed
the length I showed the height but I
didn't show the width so we've seen a
couple cards in the last year or so that
have been released with triple slot
coolers this is one of them so this card
will occupy not only the slot with your
connectors but the slot with the vent as
well as the next one because you can see
that the shroud here takes up some space
and even the copper fins with the with
the eight mil heat pipes going through
them are a little bit too high for a
dual slot cooler so a soos really wanted
to emphasize cooling and performance on
this not necessarily a compact size and
form factor
so I think that covers pretty much
everything I wanted to say about the
Aries and I hope that's everything that
you guys wanted to know I've had so many
requests for an unboxing of this card
and thank you for checking on my video
blog don't forget to subscribe and hear
one last look so heady at the Aries
cameraman inspired me to come in and
actually show you the weight difference
between a GTX 480 so I'm gonna go ahead
and put that on our scale so GTX 480
weighs about two pounds this isn't the
most accurate scale in the world but it
should give you some idea
go ahead and this is the Aries four
point eight pounds so this is a true
heavyweight one of those graphic cards
weighs more than two GTX 480 s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
