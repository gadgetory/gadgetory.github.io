the rock hat cool oh this is a surround
USB so it uses virtual 7.1 surround with
the included USB sound card but it does
have only stereo speakers so bear that
in mind this is not one of those ones
that has like you know actually 5.1
speakers all around the headset this is
using a virtual surround effect in order
to simulate the positionality of
speakers but actually it's just using
two stereo speakers so the round sound
for games and music guts sea bass that's
an interesting way to phrase it clear
trebles forty millimeter drivers okay
your cups and microphone with noise
filtering and we've already talked about
the external USB soundcard
a number of times noise cancellation i
guess they're saying is the same thing
as noise filtering and finally we have
slim remote control and neodymium
speakers fascinating let's go around on
the back and have a look at what they
have to say for themselves it looks like
pretty much the same thing ultra
comfortable ear cups that remains to be
seen in line slim remote control that's
always good to have automatic mic mute
function by folding up the microphone
that's cool i haven't seen that before
metal reinforced headband good hopefully
it's not too heavy oh there we go
extra lightweight flexible and solid
great for extended use and finally the
same thing again external sound card i
mean there's only so much you can say
about a headset so why don't we go ahead
and get it opened up so that we can you
know get the headset modeling going on
here
I know that I'm not not not the best of
models but I will I will still do my
darndest to to show you guys what this
will look like on you know a charming
and savvy gamer such as yourself it's
just a simulation though you know it's
uh you know not actually that that savvy
of a gamer I'm actually terrible at
video games so we have a new cameraman
with us today his name is slick from now
on and it is because he actually has an
oil cooled computer and I think hey
that's pretty slick and B it's kind of
like oil slick so yeah that that's why I
decided so ah crazy Russian figured he
was going to have some input into clicks
nickname but yeah he didn't
quick installation guide is included it
shows you how to install the drivers for
the USB soundcard presumably it wants
you to download the latest from the yep
to experience virtual 7.1 surround sound
please download the latest driver at
Rocket org awesome that's the same
advice that I would give you you also
get a Roccat ID card which has a
magnetic strip on the back so you can
authorize signature not valid unless
signed misuse is a criminal offense
really this is not a valid means of
payment register your personal ID using
this card on our website alright then
that's that's a pretty that's a pretty
ominous warning for a for like a club
card for buying a product I don't think
I've ever seen anything quite like that
before
so let's pull out the headset itself it
is definitely pretty lightweight it's
not the lightest headset I've ever felt
but you know what it's actually oh this
is interesting this is very Oh hold on
two seconds guys so here's something I
didn't realize on here it kind of looks
like this triangle shape is recessed but
if you look at the headset itself it's
just a mesh portion in the middle of a
soft foamy pleather II out outside so
what that means is that even though
these are not circumaural which means
they go around your ears they are soft
and they do sit up against your ears but
they will provide somewhat of a closed
experience in spite of sitting on top of
your ears because this material is going
to seal much better against the outside
of your ears versus if it was made of
all mesh and then mesh is obviously
better for sound transmission than this
so they didn't make the whole thing out
of that right cuz that would be really
stupid so here I'm going to go ahead I'm
going to put it on okay will show the
adjustments in a second here's the
included USB sound card very stylish you
know Roccat style looking good alright
and then the unit itself so we'll start
with the plugs at the end I'll show you
guys how long the cord is so the cord is
about let's see one one and one and a
quarter - arms bands and it includes a
microphone and a headphone port at the
bottom these are both marked with dots
on the basis of them here as well as
rubber stripes are
color-coded there - that was not a
grammatically sorry about that guys
so we got dots and color bands on the
connectors that are color-coded and then
moving up the cord we have our inline
volume control which they say is slim
and it is indeed very very slim so
you've just got your basic there we go
- plus and yeah that's pretty much all
there is to say about it okay so it
hangs down around this level and this is
a cool feature so we mentioned already
that the microphone will automatically
mute when you fold it up very very cool
I don't believe it has an actual mute
button on it so that is the way to
control your microphone settings so you
go ahead you put it here when you want
to talk you fold it up when you want it
muted pretty good ahh oh yeah an
adjustment so here is how high up the
adjustments on either side goes so you
could either have ears down by your
jawline or you could have a head that
goes up to about here and you'd still be
very comfortable at the pool oh I would
wear this probably one click outside of
the of the smallest possible setting in
terms of padding it's a pretty narrow
band here on the top but there is a nice
soft cushion it almost feels like a gel
up here so in my imagination anyway
because I haven't had time to use it for
an extended period this would really
mold itself over time but it's not as
soft as the memory foam style material
will feels like any way that they're
using on the headphones themselves on
the ear pads let's go ahead and move
that I just want to give you guys sort
of a closer look at the unit so there's
the metal reinforced headband they were
talking about with the plastic strip in
the middle on the inside you can see
where the where the clicks are so those
are all the increments that it can be
adjusted by the ear phones are clearly
labeled right and left although you
should pretty much be able to figure it
out based on that if you put it on this
way and try to fold down the microphone
it is not going to work
ah you've got your rock hat branding on
the side here ah in terms of flexibility
so you've got about this much degree of
motion so unlike some headsets it
doesn't fold out all the way or this way
all the way but it does give you enough
range of motion so you
it's open to a reasonable head size
there that whatever pretty much however
your ears are oriented you shouldn't
have too much trouble in terms of
discomfort so thank you for checking out
