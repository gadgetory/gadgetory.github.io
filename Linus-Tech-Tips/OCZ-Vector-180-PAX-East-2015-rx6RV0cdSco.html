youtube.com slash kingston hyperx for
sending us here this year also thank you
to linda.com and phantom glass we're
here at OCC to check out their
replacement for their vector 150 the new
not yet released yet vector 180 probably
named because they're pulling a 180 from
the vector that they are previously on
I'm sorry moving on to the drive itself
and away from terrible puns there's
three different configurations 240
gigabytes 480 gigabytes and 960
gigabytes all of these drives has a
maximum bandwidth of five hundred and
fifty megabytes per second and maximum I
ops on the two larger ones of a hundred
and k + 95 k on the smaller one
sustained I ops are 20,000 for the
smallest and the biggest one and twenty
three thousand for the 480 gig they
rated for 50 gigabytes a day of usage
and have a five-year shield plus
warranty what the heck does a shield
plus warranty mean well if anything goes
wrong with the drive they have told me
that you can send a message there are M
a team and then we'll ship you out a new
drive right away with a shipping label
for your old drive so there's a nearly
the amount of weight time that you would
have to go through if you had to ship
them your drive and then wait for them
to verify that it's broken and then they
can ship you a new one no they just send
you a new one right away and just
hopefully you send your old one back in
that's a pretty intense warranty and
probably comes from confidence due to
their acquisition from Toshiba I've been
talking with the guys here for a little
while they've been telling me that the
overall failure rates and army returns
are much lower than they used to be
something that's plugged OC said for a
while now this kit also comes with a
drive adapter so that you can clone over
and cloning software to go through that
cloning process while the overall
aesthetic design isn't super new I do
really appreciate the jet black
background and think that it's a pretty
good-looking drive overall Thank You
