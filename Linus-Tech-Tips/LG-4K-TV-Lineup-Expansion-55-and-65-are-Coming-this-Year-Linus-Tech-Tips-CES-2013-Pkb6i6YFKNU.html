our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys in 2013 LG will be expanding
their 4k TV lineup the one on my left is
an 84 inch TV that launched in October
but sort of you know a price point that
if you have to ask and you know you
probably don't have room for it next to
your 8 portions and all of that so let's
get into things that are more realistic
so here in front of me I have a 55 inch
and a 65 inch these are basically the
sizes where it's going to start making
sense to jump to 4k because below that
1080p already has a high enough pixel
density that from the couch you probably
won't be able to tell that much of a
difference now they've updated their
2013 platform with what they're calling
the Magic Remote which is kind of like a
wii modem that you can point at it or in
air mode so you can point and flick it
has a scroll wheel and you can also use
voice commands you could say something
like oh yeah you can motion in the air
just draw the number 15 go to channel 15
and you can talk to it and say you know
uh show me romantic comedies with Tom
Hanks and you'll get a list of every
movie he ever made I'm just kidding I
saw Apollo 13 I know that wasn't a
romantic comedy other important factors
these are going to be available later on
in the year so be very excited guys 4k
is very much coming to primetime
thanks for watching - tech tips at CES
