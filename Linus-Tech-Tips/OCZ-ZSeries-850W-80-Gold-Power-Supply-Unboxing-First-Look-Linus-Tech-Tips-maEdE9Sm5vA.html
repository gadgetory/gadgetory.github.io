at a pretty cool product this is an ocz
z series power supply so i actually did
their 1000 watt a little while ago but
there's a couple key differences this is
there 850 watt non modular power supply
so you don't get the benefits of a
modular interface but you still do get
all of the benefits of the OCCC series
so you've got 80 plus gold you got a
five-year warranty sli support all that
good stuff let's have a quick look at
the basic specs so you can see we're
running a single 12 volt rail featuring
71 amps of power output and that single
12 volt rail is capable of outputting
all 850 watts that this power supply can
provide so no matter what you are
powering off this power supply even if
you're doing like all graphics cards and
all stuff that's really have the 12 volt
rail stuff it can do it no matter what
as long as you're not exceeding 850
watts of course okay so the reason I'm
so interested in this power supplies i'm
actually going to be doing a full
episode of NCIS tech tips so like not
just my unboxings and like blog videos
so NCIX calm is the is the youtube
account for that and over the next i was
probably going to take a couple weeks to
put it together but i'm going to be
taking a high end system and i'm going
to be running it on an 80 plus gold
power supply specifically this one and
pitting that against a non 80 plus gold
power supply so i'm just going to find
like an older high wattage power supply
and ce4 enthusiasts who are running high
end systems that are pulling you know
500 plus wats from the wall what is the
benefit real world in terms of your
power bill of running an 80 plus gold
power supply unit so without further ado
let's get to actually unboxing this
thing so in here we'll find a little a
little sleeve that covers up all the
cables makes your packaging very tidy
that's very nice okay so pull that up
and then we've got a little ocz series
on manual showing you how to install it
give me some basic specs and it's in
about 350 different languages awesome
i'll only believe in english though
thank you then we've got a little foamy
alright and then we get down to the
power supply itself now I'm not a huge
fan of big capacity power
flies that are not modular but oh ma
minute how's this supposed to work it
looked like oh those are all attached ha
I thought those cables were an attached
I was gonna be like oh here i am saying
it's not modular but it is but it's not
modular ok so then we've got an AC power
cord a nice thick one nice and beefy
looking ok in here we will find some
velcro ties ok for managing your cables
very nice of ocz to provide and then for
thumb screws for securing the power
supply to the back of your case and that
is pretty much it in terms of
accessories so let's get the Box put
away here let's get it out of the little
protective sleeve that keeps the finish
pristine and shipping which is great
because this power supply has a terrific
brushed looking metal finish I hope you
can see that can you see that in the
camera awesome ok so there's your gold
ocz technology stickers at series 80
plus gold they got all their branding
present of course ok on the top you find
your basic specs which again outlines
that 71 amps on the 12 volt rail which
is a very key feature of this particular
unit on this side you'll find yet
another sticker and then on the back you
see the traditional honeycombed back
plate that you'll see on most ocz power
supplies and on/off switch and then the
power plug now in terms of cables like I
said I I don't like to see high-end
power supplies that are non-modular it's
not my favorite thing in the world but
if you save a few bucks great and
another factor to consider is that if
you're running a system that's really
high-end enough to pull 850 watts from
the wall you're probably using most of
these cables anyway so the benefit of a
modular interface at that point is kind
of debatable alright so let's see what
we got in terms of connectors here so
I'm just going to separate these based
on which ones have orange cables and
lemon which ones do not because those
ones probably have SATA attach them so
Wow can you kind of look up and have a
look here ok so there are four SATA
plugs on each of these three SATA cables
can seal that ok so we have 12 SATA
connections just like that alright then
we have two more cables coming out of
the power supply that feature three
molex connections
one of them all right we got three there
and then we have three more as well as
one floppy connection should you still
require a floppy drive in this day and
age and then we have a reasonably long
24-pin connector it doesn't break away
with the four pins in case you need to
power a 20 pin board but realistically
you're buying an 850 watt power supply
and empowering 20 pin board and mean
forums doesn't make any sense anyway so
that in terms of PCI oh no let's not do
PCI Express yet okay first let's do the
dual 8 pin connectors that's really nice
to see because if you're running a board
like the classified which actually
accepts 28 pin connectors for cpu power
then you will have them okay and then we
have support for 46 plus 2 pin PCI
Express connectors so if you're running
any potential to card configuration so
you're looking at even like dual 59 70s
you will have enough cables to run it if
you're looking at a try card
configuration then you better make sure
that each card only has one plug on it
otherwise you will not have enough so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the ocz z-series a goal power supply
oh I didn't even look at the fan that
looks like a 135 no fan it's got lots of
blades good static pressure etc etc you
got your ocz logo that looks very nice
ok and as I mentioned before I'm going
to be doing like a quick look at what OC
arm at what 80 plus gold efficiency
actually means in terms of real world
power bill and so you should definitely
check that out when it comes out later
on down the line thank you for checking
out my unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
