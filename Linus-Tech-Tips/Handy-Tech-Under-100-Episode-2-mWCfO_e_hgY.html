delivers the convenience of an
all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more well I guess if we do two videos
about this it's sort of a series so
here's our cool technology and gadgets
and gizmos under $100 episode 2 we're
going to start with this guy right here
this is the most basic concept ever a
charging cable that you'll always have
on you they've got the charge key in the
shape of the key to go in your key chain
and the charge card which unintuitive
lis isn't a credit card but rather a
cable in the shape of a card to go in
your wallet they sent us the micro USB
version of the charge key but either
version is also available with a
lightning connector for Apple users
their website
hello nomads comm lets you order the
product and has an FAQ with information
ranging from very useful to completely
laughable mixed in with what speed do
your cables charge at are great bits
like their 30 day no questions asked
return policy and lifetime warranty
against breakage that covers an
unlimited number of bends due to the use
of high grade plastics which leads us
finally to the price it is a flat 25
dollars for the charge key or the charge
card for Android users it's a bit of a
tough sell I think at monoprice comm I
can get over 40 standard one and a half
foot USB micro cables for 25 bucks and
put five of them in my car five of them
on my boat etc etc but for some folks
the convenience of being able to wear it
will be a selling factor the lightning
cable is much more palatable to me
because Apple users are already going to
have to spend about 12 dollars on a
lightning cable at somewhere like
monoprice so for only about double the
cost of a normal cable you're getting
the convenient one next up we have the
pluggable USB 2 gigabit ethernet adapter
a USB to Ethernet adapter is something
most people haven't really needed in the
past but with how much I hate Wireless
and the rapid disappearance of hardline
networking from even devices like
notebooks it's becoming really hard for
me to get by without one
actually originally bought a sad rant
USB two gigabit one that worked really
well and is now providing the dual and
connectivity I needed to turn my aspire
one netbook into a PF sense router but
since it was permanently tied up I
needed to go back and find a new one to
use on my Ultrabook and NVIDIA shield
when I want a more reliable connection
and the pluggable brand one appears to
be the exact same thing it works
perfectly on my PC and installed
driverless lis on my Nvidia shield and
it's five dollars cheaper than the other
one on Amazon so it's 25 bucks works on
Windows Mac Chromebook Linux and some
Android devices as well obviously
because it's USB - you're not getting
full gigabit speeds but it's faster than
10 100 and has better compatibility than
a USB 3 solution so that's a trade-off
that I was willing to make for this one
our next item is the titanium smart fast
MD 1600 L 16 bei nickel metal hydride
battery charger and this is something I
wish I had had years ago compared to the
basic chargers that you can get bundled
with your eneloop batteries my favorite
rechargeables by the way they offer
little graphical indicators of charge
progress more smart charging features to
make the batteries last longer the
obviously higher battery capacity and
finally a couple of little USB charging
port so you can go ahead and you know
chuck a phone or a portable battery bank
on it to charge at the same time as all
your other batteries each battery is on
its own channel so you don't have to
populate two adjacent Bay's at once with
identical batteries and the charger can
monitor the charge state of each Bay
individually it charges either double
A's or triple-a batteries and comes with
a wall wart as well as a where is it
this one haha or a 12-volt car adapter
you can take it with you pretty much
wherever we actually took it with us to
CES although we were driving around
there but the point that you can travel
with it still remains the charger is
only 50 bucks and you can get started
with the charger and 16 and loops to
fill it up with for about a hundred
dollars total so stop wasting money on
disposable and switch to any loops they
are absolutely awesome which leads us to
our last and most expensive product
today I'm holding it upside down this is
the air
doc it's actually not quite shipping yet
but the IndieGoGo campaign is ending
soon and they've got at least a few
samples that they are finished enough
with to send out to reviewers so I spent
some time with it my sample came with a
short windshield mount and a long
flexible windshield mount that has to be
the sturdiest flex arm I've ever seen I
mean it is tough to bend and then once
you've got it in position
it absolutely stays then the build
quality continues to impress me with a
solid feeling ball joint at the top that
locks into the head where the phone or
tablet can rest and then I've saved you
know them up reasonable suction cup so
it seemed cool already then it happens
it's stuck to it and then I saw it
includes qi wireless charging with a
micro USB plug on the side and an
included micro USB cable that you can
run down to your cigarette lighter or
whatever else and now it's got my
attention because when you consider that
a decent car mount is 15 to 25 bucks and
a Qi charging pad is 20 to 30 dollars
this is looking pretty competitive at
that indiegogo price is 63 dollars now
throw in the kicker the head uses
magnets for phones with magnetic
mounting plates inside them combined
with what air doc is calling okay magic
foam which caused my eyes to almost roll
out of their sockets to achieve a very
strong bond between your device and the
doc without really putting any effort
into it but of course I needed to see it
to believe it it only really works on
smooth surfaces so you'll want either a
smooth back phone like the LG g2 that I
have here or a smooth case for your
existing one but man when it works it's
really amazing I mean listen to the
sound of the bond here in there demo
video they even show it working with
tablets my HTC One kinda works without
my pink mat case when it's backing and
the air doc are perfectly clean so you
can kind of see it you can get a little
bit of a bond there and the good news is
that you can clean it with water and
restore its stickiness as long as you're
careful not to damage the electronics
inside but that's not something that I
would trust with my phone day today so
stick to the phones that air doc or your
friends have validated you can check
the phone compatibility list on the
IndieGoGo campaign linked below with the
where to buy links to all of this cool
stuff also there and they're also
offering deals in their IndieGoGo
campaign on Qi charging cases for some
devices that don't already support it
and I think you've got about two weeks
left to get one at the pre-order price
once the pre-order price goes away I've
yet to see how much they're going to be
charging for it when it's back up to
full pop so you might want to check that
out while the campaign is still running
so full disclosure guys these hundred
dollar or less gadget guides are much
more like recommendations to buy than
our other videos so in the interest of
making sure that you guys know what
you're watching and what you're looking
at I want to make sure you understand
where these gadgets all came from the
ANA loops and the charger that you saw
were bought by me for business use here
at Linus Media Group the USB to Ethernet
adapter so I actually bought two of them
there's another one around here
somewhere
were bought by me for personal use the
prototype air dock was sent to me for
free by the founder of arrow dock when I
expressed interest in the campaign and
asked for a sample it's something I was
about 50/50 about funding even if I
didn't get a sample of it and now that I
have my hands on it it has met my
expectations so I quite like it and then
finally the charge key was sent to my
editor ed zl-- who thought it was cool
and I agreed so we didn't pay for that
one and particularly for the micro USB
version I don't think either of us would
but we both saw the utility of it and
figured some people might be interested
so we figured we'd throw it into the
video and show it to you guys speaking
of interested if this video was
interesting to you and you want to make
sure that we can keep making videos here
