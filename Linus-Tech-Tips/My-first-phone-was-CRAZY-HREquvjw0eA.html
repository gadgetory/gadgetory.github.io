the other day and you know the whole
theory that goes yeah you can sell or
buy pretty much anything on eBay I
figured okay I'm gonna put this to the
test can I find my first cell phone and
the answer is yes so this is the
Motorola V 100 II or as it was called
over here in North America the V box it
was my first cell phone and apparently
this thing works so I am gonna open it
up and show you guys just how stone-age
I am after I tell you about fresh books
fresh books is the easy to use
accounting solution built for how you
want to work stay organized and
productive try their 30 day free trial
at fresh books comm forward slash tech
tips
so I think one of the most fun things
about this video is gonna be to compare
and contrast my current daily driver
here in 2018 with the very first cell
phone that I ever owned and I got this
thing back in well I mean I could
probably just look at the Cape act in
the EU blabbity blabbity does it have a
have any kind of date information on it
so hold on a second so I was I was 16 I
had just gotten my full license the deal
was that I got a car and a cell phone
it's a pretty sweet deal as long as I
was willing to drive my four siblings to
and from wherever they needed to go and
as long as I was at my parents beck and
call at anytime so this is like
effectively I was the family driver and
this was like my pager so that would
have been about 2003 I want to say
around around 2003 years ago so let's
talk a little bit about this thing it
has a special keypad console which makes
text messaging to your friends easier
use WAP to access a range of information
via your phone including cinema listings
entertainment and sport widescreen this
you'll display excellent from when you
are playing you're playing from a choice
of three games so my mom my stepdad and
I all got the same phones and it was
important for us because my mom is hard
of hearing so talking with her on the
phone isn't really an option so this was
all of a sudden a reason for us to have
phones and a way for us to stay in touch
so I got this super cheap plan that had
like a hundred minutes like and no no
like unlimited weekends or evenings or
anything like that and then it was
mostly I just had like 250 text messages
and so we could we could text back and
forth so here I want to show you guys
what's in here so this is just from an
eBay seller so I actually I'm not a
hundred percent oh oh hold on no no it's
okay so sorry I was thinking oh no it
doesn't come with the north
I can adapt her but actually they just
used the North American version to adapt
to the UK one so we just we just dodged
a huge bullet here cuz like I could have
probably found a substitute for this or
like frickin I don't know its 404 point
4 volts 1 amp what the hell is that
do you guys like do you guys remember
non-standard mobile device chargers what
a nightmare that was like it's it's so
easy to take for granted stuff that we
just don't have to deal with anymore
alright so hopefully we're good then
what else we got
battery storage case for your protection
store battery in this case when not in
use
well someone clearly didn't read the
label because I wonder if it even comes
with a battery I mean this battery is
long dead
like years ago this battery was dead
haha okay you know what I'm gonna get to
this later it was the worst thing about
this phone by far this
okay I was actually kind of worried that
this wasn't gonna be the right thing but
no this this is it you know I'm actually
so sad that clear plastic casings died
off like does that not actually look
kind of cool like if you could buy a
modern cell phone that had a backing
like that so you could see the battery
and stuff would that not be cool so yeah
you can see actually you can see the PCB
for the display here mine had a
different logo mine had like a Motorola
logo didn't have a Rogers logo I don't
know I think I'm pretty sure it just had
a standard Motorola logo in terms of I
oh there's an OK button here that you
could use to answer calls I don't
remember what this special button over
here did this right here is the charging
port nothing on the back just the hinge
here and then Oh glory be it's got a
headphone jack so as cool as it was that
my phone had a headphone jack oh boy
this isn't about as good condition as
I'd expect it to be the headphone jack
problem number one
it wasn't f3 and Hoffman
it was the less standard more fragile
two and a half mil problem number ii the
headphone jack was actually the only way
to get audio in and out of the device
that just blow your mind so get this the
expectation okay for motorola geniuses
that they are other than some pretty
stupid crap they've pulled over the
years the expectation was that this goes
in your pocket or eclipse to your belt
because that was a thing back then okay
and you put this very comfortable
earpiece in your ear and you just kind
of hope that that's it somewhere kind of
desirable also it wasn't a very good
microphone now there was a
another solution and I did invest in
this aforementioned other solution for
myself and that was that you could pull
the battery cover off and there was a
module that added about this much more
thickness to the phone that had a
microphone in one end and an earphone
jack in the other end and then a little
wire that plugged into here so you had
this like dongle and actually it was the
it must have been the other way it was
the other way so you had this dongle and
you would hold it like this up up
against her head and it was like
literally this thick by that point it
had kind of this weird kind of wavy sort
of pattern to it anyway I I wasn't able
to get one of those because who the hell
would have kept them but as you guys can
probably guess having it sitting like
that in your pocket all the time wore
out the headphone jacks within a matter
of months for every single one of us to
the point where I was always like this
with my pinky on the jack holding it in
place while I'm trying to conduct a
phone call let's find out if this eBay
seller is full of crap so they claim it
works why they even had this thing why
they thought to list it on eBay I don't
know but it was they're freaking lucky
because I paid like 70 bucks for it
which is most assuredly not worth I just
hey look at that
charging complete baby although I'm
willing to bet that it turns off in
media this battery is completely hooptie
hooptie whoa whoa hey no nice holy crap
it's working so the frequency support
for this phone is such that there's no
way I'm getting on a network it's like I
forget where were 800 over here and
there 850 over there DSM blah blah blah
doesn't matter anyway the point is
there's no way that's gonna work over
here but what we can do is holy crap
access Internet
yeah Network know how to available I
should certainly think so I think yeah I
think we're done here do you do you
remember when phones used to have like
limited number of phone numbers you
could store on them and stuff so called
timers right right because we used to be
so worried about how long we were
spending on the phone cuz we only had a
limited number of minutes that like it
was important to have a timer oh man
audible call timers so it would beep
every minute so you'd know how many
minutes you are using that is so awesome
Wow I just had like a like a flashback
moment that was my ringtone like in high
school you know ring or vibrate at least
I had vibrate you couldn't take that for
granted back then so that was nice when
I get texts in class or whatever I used
this one at one point sorry I'm just
like having fun right now I guess I
could keep making a video Hey oops
that's menu crap hey so thanks for
helping the terrible keyboard thanks for
helping me instead I mean didn't really
have a lot of functions I think the last
thing to really show off for you guys
has got to be games oh oh that's right
hold on hold on there so that's your
quick settings let go your quick stuff
vibrate on off oh my god this is so
awesome
alright okay last thing then play some
games towers of Hanoi baccarat and
bricks so I actually never really played
towers of Hanoi like like I know I know
how the game works
and then baccarat I didn't really
understand the game at the time options
bet on player bet on banker bet on tie
and you just you put in like an amount
and then you deal and then someone would
win and then you would get or lose
points so I didn't really like get it
yeah we can end the game but bricks I
played a lot and like the other games
there wasn't really a great deal of
depth to it like it's not like the ball
starts to go faster or anything in fact
if I recall correctly once you clear the
bricks
you just bounce the ball around in an
empty thing but don't quote me on that
let's we're just gonna have to see how
this plays out I think like the funny
thing is I could say to my kids with a
straight face when I was a boy real we
had one level then we were happy to have
it and of course like the paddle does
not like that the spot on the paddle
that you hit doesn't affect the angle
the ball comes off it at so you just
kind of have to I gotta go to win so
but instead I'm stuck here like oh no
it's not affected by how you're moving
when it hits it is - there we go
physics so you can spin it okay alright
we got this we got this I can do it I
can do it wait for it oh shoot that
could have gotten it too okay did we get
it yeah I got it
scored yes that's right so you could
pause when it was clear and you could
like take a breather and then continue
later
so that's it you guys that was my first
phone the Motorola V 100 or VBox as it
was called by my carrier here in Canada
there were a lot of a lot of sacrifices
there was not a lot of sex appeal but
for better or for worse that got me
through my high school social life and
