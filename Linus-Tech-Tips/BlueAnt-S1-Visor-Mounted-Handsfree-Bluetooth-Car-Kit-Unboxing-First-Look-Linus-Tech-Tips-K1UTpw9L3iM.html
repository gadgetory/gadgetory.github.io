ant s1 this is a Bluetooth car kit and
it is a hands-free device but basically
just allows you to drive in your car
without using your hands on your cell
phone now with the local law is changing
these have become a very hot product
category because come the new year
everyone will be required to use one
legally in order to talk on their phone
while they're driving so let's have a
look at some of the features that make
the s1 a particularly good value first
of all you can't talk and three ok very
good
it supports voice dialing as well as
voice answering it is multi-point so
that means if you have one of these in
your car you can actually have two
different people with their phones
mounted to it and then whichever one
rings you can answer that phone that's
very convenient has noise and echo
cancellation Bluetooth 2.0 you can
stream music from your phone it operates
up to 10 meters from the phone and if
you have a 10 meter long car then yeah I
mean okay that should basically be all
you really need okay up to 15 hours of
talktime any hours of it
sorry 800 hours of standby so let's get
this open and have a quick look now I
also want to do a quick video outlining
the setup procedure for this but let's
have just a short look at the unit
itself if I could just get the Box open
then that would work really really
really well okay so I've actually used
one of these before although it wasn't
an s1 but I found it was these visor
mounted kits are an incredibly effective
way of mounting the hands-free in your
kit in a way that it can actually hear
you and you can hear the speaker clearly
without window noise affecting it okay
so first of all it comes with a charger
so this is just a standard wall jack two
USB five volt charger so that means you
could probably charge it and I'm gonna
say with 99% certainty you can charge it
if you just plugged it into your
computer with the USB cable so let's
have a look at the documentation that
comes with it first of all we have okay
wow there's like four different things
in here s1 okay so this gives you a
brief overview of the unit itself so you
can see that we've got the speaker the
Bluetooth light the microphone the
charger port end / reject button volume
up and down and the multifunction button
so this is
off paring answering calls voice dialing
redial and audio transfer okay so we've
got all that and you've got some basic
manual showing you how to do pretty much
everything you need to do so it's a
QuickStart guide then we have that but
in French alright and then we have a
warranty information card and then
finally last but not least we have the
s-1 itself so let me just see if I can
figure out how to get this out of here
oh that's some I may not be able to get
this out because I'm just not that
clever some days oh there we go okay so
the clip comes off here it's supposed to
I think yeah it comes the clip comes off
and then but but awesome I didn't break
it okay so the clip comes off and this
is the clip that you use to mount it to
your Sun Visor so that it basically sits
above your head right about here and you
can see that the mic is conveniently
positioned on this side so that's gonna
be away from the window and here we can
have a look at all the different
features that we have here so we've got
the speaker and then there's your
Bluetooth light there's the mic
there's the charging port that was
mentioned in our QuickStart guide and
then here are all the pertinent buttons
so there's your your main confirm okay
button volume up and down as well as
your cancel reject etc button so it's
quite it's quite a light unit and I look
forward to showing you guys how to set
it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
