here which means that the rift can
finally and more properly compete with
the HTC vive what does this mean for the
rift and the virtual reality community
as a whole actually a lot this is a big
deal and you should be excited no matter
which team you're on I'll explain why
after we take a look at the controller's
themselves and the rifts experience with
the new members of the family
Tunnel bares the simple VPN app that

off if you have any questions about the
rift headset itself check out this video
from about four months ago reviewing the
rift without the touch controllers just
by itself not much has changed on the
headset side of things other than well
the inclusion of the sensor that comes
with the touch controllers but I'll talk
about tracking and occlusion later on
for now controller economics and the
degree to which you can have hand
presence in VR the touch controllers
just feel amazing in your hands you know
when you put your hands down on a
familiar keyboard and mouse setup your
fingers and palm they just naturally
form to them the fingers on your left
hand comfortably rest on W a and D
because you're probably a gamer and your
right thumb finds its comfortable back
button for efficient web browsing it
just it feels like home this is similar
to the touch controller experience but
it's like that from the first time that
you ever try them they're so naturally
comfortable that I rarely even need to
tell people the control bindings for
games even when games don't do it
themselves they just play because the
touch controllers feel like a natural
extension of your hands the thumb stick
and buttons on the top of the controller
feel solid the grip button on the side
of the controller is very light and
feels great when you're actually trying
to hold something in the game because it
fades away into the body of the
controller just so well the trigger does
leave a little to be desired in shooter
games it could be described as squishy
but in other games like say the unspoken
while you're casting spells it feels
great and overall I think they found a
happy medium here considering other
titles on the platform like well medium
which isn't combat focused at all I
personally think that they found the
right balance
wrapping up the physical impressions the
touch controllers are also very light
which can be a good or bad thing
depending on what experience you're in
they've got this really cool magnetic
release cover for the single double a
battery per controller
which seems to last about 30 freakin
hours which is more than any reasonable
person could possibly need in one place
ession not a challenge by the way not a
challenge
and finally easily one of the most
interesting features is the capacitive
touch that is seemingly everywhere that
your hand will actually be even the
thumb stick this makes it so the
controller not only knows how far down
you're pulling the trigger but whether
or not your hand is on it at all or any
other part of the controller for that
matter which makes it so that you can do
more complex hand gestures like pointing
waving thumbs up or even the crowd
favorite giving someone the finger this
is more important than it seems at first
as it deepens your immersion in VR makes
you feel more connected to your
character which matters a lot now don't
get me wrong here the vive wands were
great and they came out like eight
months before the touch controllers this
gave vive users the greater part of a
year to enjoy hand presence in VR before
oculus even showed up to the damn party
but now they're here and they're better
but that being said valve hasn't been
asleep for eight months either they've
been working on their own prototype
controllers that ditch the donut
formation on top for a sensor bar that
wraps around the back of your hand this
is a very early demo but it includes
things like the halfway closed hand and
various other hand gestures that we saw
on the touch controllers also included
in the box with the touch controllers is
an additional sensor so if you've bought
the headset and the controller
separately you now have two so that
means that in oculus is recommend a desk
mount configuration you can move around
a little bit but you can't really turn
around they also support 360 degree
tracking with two controllers but they
don't recommend that you stand while
trying it and you just put the sensors
in opposing corner configuration but for
the best experience a third sensor
purchased separately is recommended then
you can stand and turn around radical
the superior
three sensor configuration will get you
to a place pace of 8.2 by 8.2 feet by
comparison the Vives maximum tracking
area is 11.5 feet by 11.5 feet or 15 by
15 if you go with Allen Yates now
assuming you have the space for it and
can drill into your walls or find some
other solution the vibe out of the box
is still a better experience than the
rift tracking why's that being said
there is content online with people
showing off that for rift sensors works
very well if you've got additional $80
beyond the already eighty extra dollars
that you've paid for the third one so
for the first time ever I feel like I
have both the finished vibe and the
finished rift with which to craft a
conclusion there are many positives and
negatives in each direction I personally
prefer the ergonomics of the oculus
touch controllers a great deal the
included headphones on the rift are
great the ergonomics of the rift
particularly it's lower weight are great
but it's tether is too short and the
vibes tracking out of the box is
considerably better you can also hook
the vive into a backpack rig while the
rift sensors need to be plugged into the
USB ports of the computer running the
rift so that's not a realistic option
with those trade-offs in mind the choice
is yours instead of it being a clear
decision like it was in the past I see
very justifiable reasons to go with
either experience and as most people
don't have massive areas that they can
clear out for VR games I suspect many
will go with the rift but there's one
last thing to bring up the touch
controllers are launching alongside over
50 made for VR titles a few of which are
bundled with the touch controllers which
is pretty damn cool these games were a
highly controversial topic when I wrote
my rift review back in the day where
oculus was paying developers to launch
on their platform first but the word
first being key here it doesn't mean
exclusive the touch controllers finally
launching is great for rift users
obviously but it's great for vive users
as well not only because valve is trying
to make theirs more similar which is
better in my opinion but because the
huge group of developers working on
their games for the touch launch
maybe also start developing for vive if
you want that to happen hit your
favorite game developer up on twitter
and let them know you're interested I
know I sure will
verdaguer sells racing chairs and gaming
styled chairs they have two main Racing
lineups as well as their new trigger
series of gaming chairs they're easy to
assemble and they glide smoothly on any
surface they have adjustable seat
Heights and the seats themselves can be
locked into five different tilted
positions the chairs are made with steel
frames which helps keep the chair stable
while also keeping it lightweight most
mechanical parts are covered by leather
which makes the chair easy to clean and
the plus line is designed for comfort
giving the user more space inside of the
chair the S line is smaller and more
ergonomic you can check them out in the
link in the video description thank you
guys for watching it's an exciting time
for VR even though most people are off
the bandwagon but I understand that if
you liked the video like it you just
like the video dislike it get subscribed
comment down below and hit us up on the
forum where you can talk to other people
that aren't YouTube commenters about
things and stuff which is a phrase that
Linus absolutely hates stuff in things I
think it's more specifically what he
hates
I kept it out of the main body of the
video I brought it up in the conclusion
it's fun don't worry about it down below
you go to Amazon and buy some stuff
including a shirt like hash tag out of
ideas
this is possibly my favorite shirt out
of like all the ones we've made so far
if you want to watch another video check
out this one it is my rift review just
the headset that I mentioned earlier in
this very video and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
