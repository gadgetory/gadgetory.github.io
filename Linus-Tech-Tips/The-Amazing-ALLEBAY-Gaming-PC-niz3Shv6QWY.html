recommended parts for building your own
PC there's one complaint that oh yeah
that you know that was pretty mean but
the random stranger I've never met and
never will has a point
maybe it's just as viable and maybe it's
way cheaper to build a PC on eBay maybe
within the same budget you could build a
much more kick-ass rig than you could by
going through New Ager Amazon maybe none
of this is a maybe because maybe we
already did it and maybe I'm gonna tell
you guys all about it
G skillz tried n'zeer oil series ddr4
Ram features a polished aluminum heat
spreader in gold or silver and this
gorgeous crystalline light bar that
radiates RGB in every direction check it
out at the link below
so we began our journey with a spec list
for like a decent gaming PC on PC part
picker that ended up at just over $1000
for all new parts at retail prices now
we didn't choose this price point for
any particular reason
other than that it's just kind of what
we ended up with for a good bang for the
buck gaming PC so with any luck eBay is
either going to increase our bang or
decrease the buck now of course
regardless of price the main
disadvantage of ordering off eBay is
that you're going to be stuck getting
all of your parts piecemeal which for us
meant that we actually had to wait about
a month in between ordering all this
stuff
and making this video here for you
people which is going to be an eternity
if you're just looking to fire up some
apex legends with your buddies now to
mitigate that somewhat we did actually
limit ourselves to buy it now items
rather than furiously refreshing auction
pages so you can assume that with some
more patience you could actually do a
little bit better than us but then how
well did we do it's time for a whole
video let's start off with our case then
okay this honestly didn't matter much we
were going for cheap and functional and
it ended up being a rose will Nautilus
that won the day it was packed well
enough and it's arguably a reasonably
attractive case too if you're into the
whole kind of glossy plastic look now
you might be thinking to yourself when
you first open up the case doesn't the
Nautilus come with two fans in the box
and yes it does they just happened to be
loose in the box for us for some reason
actually if we're being honest the
shipping was overall quite horrible for
this thing and worse the Nautilus is
supposed to have a windowed side panel
and as you guys already saw it does it
just was installed on the wrong side so
clearly they were packing it up in a
freaking hurry I mean this is what you
get sometimes when you go with eBay and
the thing is that with cheap cases we
actually found that the pricing for used
ones on eBay wasn't really any better
than just buying an entry-level case at
retail unless of course you count the
extra value high yes not one not two but
three extra SATA cables were included in
the box so then once we get all of our
wires managed and kind of where they're
supposed to be right gonna take that off
that's all it's a window that we can
move on zero gravity that seems to be
what whoever packed this was hoping for
because that's the only way it was gonna
survive next up it next up is our power
supply at 80 plus rating for the power
supply of any modern computers pretty
much non-negotiable and we're gonna want
about 500 watts of continuous power for
our build to live and to give us some
room to expand
now despite its shortcomings like its
lack of modular cabling and if we're
being honest middling overall
performance EVGA is 500 be fit the bill
for us nicely now this one right here is
an open box model so it hasn't been used
very much if at all actually doesn't
have a speck of dust on it so this looks
like a pretty good score for 25 US
dollars now for the platform that's
going to go into our
kind of rats nest over here we wanted
something that was gonna have at least
eight threads with enough per thread
performance that games won't end up
slowed down by our CPU so Rison is kind
of a no-brainer at this price point and
there were some very decent deals to be
had on the gen 1 risin 5 1600 X now we
had considered an engineering sample
core i7 8700 non K but it has a locked
multiplier and no heatsink in the box
if we're gonna have to buy a CPU cooler
anyway we want to be able to overclock
so we ended up by the way with a deep
cool gam Max 400 which cost us about $24
now with just a 6 core CPU and a single
graphics card we don't need the fanciest
motherboard on the block so we went
hunting for a B Series board with a
decent vrm layout for dad overclocking
now virtually all the options available
on eBay with decent pricing were refurbs
which means that they only come with IO
shields if you're lucky
although we did also get a Wi-Fi antenna
so that's nice but thankfully that's
actually not a big deal for us thanks to
our or it bonus SATA cables anyway
the choice really came down to between
two boards from a sues the be 350 plus
and the be 450 plus now the chipset
difference doesn't really matter for us
because we're running first gen Rison
but we decided to spend the extra five
dollars on the newer beef 450 board if
only because it's likely to get firmware
updates for longer next up is RAM now 16
gigs was our target for comfortable
gaming and multitasking including
running the notorious memory hog chrome
web browser but the thing that we kind
of ran into here is that memory
deals on eBay were few and far between
so we ended up going with this like the
definition of bog-standard no-name ddr4
2400 and this stuff is weird like
there's no visible branding even on the
chips themselves where you'd normally
see you know some kind of name you
recognize like Samsung or SK Hynix and
when we fired up these modules to test
them we couldn't even find a vendor ID
string spooky I mean at least it was
cheap this is funny to warranty void if
removed what warranty
from who nobody knows anyways speaking
of cheap our storage options now we
wanted an SSD that was large enough to
handle our operating system and our key
applications so a crucial MX 500 250 gig
fit the bill just nicely not only is it
yes
dirt cheap but it also has a dram cache
which is important for its long-term
performance the one thing it can't do is
handle a big Steam library so we also
grabbed this 2 terabyte Western Digital
7200 rpm Enterprise Drive which was a
steal at $49 so both of these are either
new or open box because buying heavily
used storage is just not the brand of
fun that we're gonna get into today
finally we come to the single most
important piece of any gaming rig our
graphics card so our goal was to pick up
something that's capable of running
1440p at 60fps or 1080p at much higher
frame rates like you know 120 or 144
Hertz and so we quickly narrowed down
our search to either the geforce gtx
980ti or gtx 1070 TI which are
surprisingly quite similarly priced at
around 300 u.s. dollars right now which
is a bit strange when you consider that
the 980ti
is actually closer to a regular 1070
rather than a 10
seventy TI so obviously we ended up then
with the 1070 TI at least though to the
980 TI is credit it's not as bad a value
as some of the older Titans that we were
considering early on so right now this
looks like about the sweet spot in the
used market so I guess a lot of the
folks who bought 1070 T eyes are
upgrading or else we got a mining card
which is possible it's clean but it
looks cleaned as opposed to clean so
after a not insignificant amount of
cable management Thank You Anthony we've
got our buildin all of its secondhand
glory all in we spent about seven
hundred and seventy-six dollars before
shipping which if we were in the
continental US would have been about
fifty bucks which is just about two
hundred and fifty dollars saved versus
our retail build now there are a couple
of small issues like that wireless
antenna I was so pleased about being
included doesn't plug into our
motherboard and that i/o shield that we
were so happy to have is also not
correct for our motherboard but hey
Jamie is gaming so why don't we take it
for a spin
alright oh we need to turn vsync off and
move okay I just need to turn off that
motion blur you motion blur you all
right we resume the game
dang Anthony this is one cheap 130 FPS
at 2560 by 1440 and doom look at that
responsiveness I mean you'd never know
sort of looking at the frame rates for
running at here that this is like a you
know ghetto jank eBay PC I mean it
doesn't make your skills any better but
like not bad at all oops him in the
ankles oh no oh no CPU temps were
sitting nice in there just 40 plus range
although bear in mind of course
Jambi does record CP temperature
slightly differently from Intel when we
do shadow the Tomb Raider something a
little New York thing working exactly as
we'd expect
why don't we crank this puppy to
exclusive full screen turn that vsync
off highest no motion blur so here we're
stuck with the built-in benchmark but
that'll still give us a pretty good idea
of how this guy's gonna run were you
using hot glue for this build Anthony
well someone got hot glue on the table
oh you know what I think that's me not
that so remembering that we were
targeting 1440p 60fps that is looking at
pretty darn nice so yeah we're a little
on the low side but remember we
absolutely cranked this game and this is
one of the top triple-a titles from 2018
so oh good you give me a gun oh that's
so nice nice person and inspect with it
really
that's a button to stare at your weapon
so we're in Apex legends now I'm aware
that the HD textures are not done
downloading but for some reason they've
stopped coming down and I don't really
know what the issue is with that so
we're just gonna go ahead and assume
that it'll be some performance amount
that's a little lower than this the good
news is that's honestly pretty fine
because we're looking at like 70 80 plus
frames per second not bad at all I'm
officially better than half of the
people who joined this match don't have
any bullet guns but gun bullets yeah
he's done oh alright and we're dead so
that was it for my apex legends career
could have gone pro if only I had any
skills and practiced so at the end of
the day some of the items were either
the same price or more expensive on eBay
compared to retail but if you're
strapped for cash and you need a cheap
way to get some gaming grade hardware at
least some of them were a better deal as
long as you don't care too much about
warranties now the risk of getting
something that's just dead on arrival is
not as much as you might think
thanks to eBay's from our experience
anyway excellent buyer protection so
what it really comes down to then is
your willingness to deal with a
premature failure that doesn't come with
any kind of manufacturer warranty
support as for me well as a tinkerer the
way that I've always looked at it is
that if I save nearly the cost of my
single most expensive component on a
build then I can literally afford to
replace any piece of it that fails and
worst case scenario I'll be back where I
started
then if it doesn't fail well then I get
to keep that money in my pocket and
that's a pretty appealing reward for a
little bit of extra effort and patience
