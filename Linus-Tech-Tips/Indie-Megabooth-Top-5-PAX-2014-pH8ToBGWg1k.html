guys welcome to our indie mega booth top
5 just as a note games we've covered
before are not going to be in this so
stuff like zing and distance are here
and they're awesome I'm not going to
cover them in this top 5 because I've
covered them before in the past so let's
get right to it the first game and I
don't usually admit this but my favorite
one here was rockets rockets rockets I
played a game to Nick crazy game it's
all about shooting insane amount of
rockets your this little spaceship thing
and you gotta fly around and it's all
directional with a thumb stick you pick
where you fly and it's the thruster
based movement so if you push your thumb
stick in one direction it's going to try
to throw you in that direction so you
have momentum you're gonna fly all over
the place is tons of fun and you're
shooting an insane amount of rockets at
each other it's all about timing your
shields so you have to pop your shield
on which doesn't last forever and try to
block either the rocket or use your time
shield to smash into the other dude well
he doesn't have a shield on and you have
to try to mix that all together and it's
very fun because it's really really
really fast paced it's on Steam right
now for early access they're rolling out
big updates every month I believe it's
about five dollars right now not all the
features are in there obviously because
it's early access which I know not a ton
of us are actually fans up but it will
be releasing I believe some time in q1
or q2 of 2015 if you're interested in it
it'll be up one to four players there's
going to have solo modes gonna have
online multiplayer a lot of the stuff
again isn't in the game yet but tons of
it will be there so i would highly
suggest checking it out i know i'm going
to as a lot of fun secondly in no
particular order there's a salt android
cactus which is a super fun bullet hell
with aid in my opinion not that
fantastic name but you'll remember it so
i guess they got that job done it's a
bullet hell where you can play one to
four players with four players it's more
kind of like a party mode with an insane
amount of enemies and with one player
it's more tactical and precise and you
have to be very careful it's interesting
tons of different levels boss Mo's all
that kind of stuff and I'm pretty sure
they can have online multiplayer later I
believe it's in early access right now
so I believe you can check it out on
steam so yeah if you're into bullet
hell's maybe check that out then we come
to cannon brawl a game where if
you're sitting next to the person you're
playing against I wouldn't even be that
surprised if it gets physical because
what it is is it's kind of like a worm's
esque style map you have your main base
and you can have to build cannons and
shields and other kind of structures to
fight with the other guy and whoever
destroys the other person space first
wins but because of how the game is
paced I fully expect you to end up
punching the guy before you actually win
we'll see how that goes for you I
believe it's on Steam early access right
now so you can check it out it's quite a
bit of fun if you're into that kind of
base versus based style game then we
come to dark net a hacker game but a
Hollywood hacker game like pretty much
all of them are the idea is it's a VR
game inoculates it's coming to whatever
platform it supported in later on
they're pretty much just tying
themselves to VR in general and it's
it's a puzzle game you get different
things like worms and viruses and all I
kind of stuff you have to go through and
take over nodes you get money from
taking over the nose and you can buy
more viruses and whatnot fairly standard
puzzle game but it isn't kind of like a
hacker environment so if you're into
that kind of scene maybe you'd like it
check it out on steam i believe it's in
early access not now but he said soon so
whenever that is and last but not least
a super meat boy forever this isn't
necessarily a new idea as a super meat
boy but the idea behind it is that you
pick kind of a difficult difficulty or a
zone and then it just randomly generates
the levels for you that's why it's
called forever you could potentially
play this game forever and I expect
quite a few my friends to pretty much do
that I have quite a few people that I
know that love Super Meat Boy including
Linus I'm sure he'll be excited to hear
about this as I've been watching their
randomly generated content and it all
seems quite quality so I'm excited to
check this game out as well alright guys
I hope you liked our indie mega booth
roundup you can check hopefully links
for those games and description down
below although some of them don't have
any like so I don't know how that's
going to work right you'll figure it out
also before you go click on this button
