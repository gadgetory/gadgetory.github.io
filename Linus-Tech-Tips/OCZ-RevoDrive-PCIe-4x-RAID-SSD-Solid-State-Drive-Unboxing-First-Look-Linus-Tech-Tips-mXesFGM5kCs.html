today we're gonna be unboxing the OCC
Revo Drive this is a bootable PCI
Express solid-state drive it offers
unmatched performance it is sand force
driven it runs off PCI Express Gen 2 x4
and it has internal raid 0 so that's all
the stuff off the front of the box which
is pretty much all I needed to say about
it it's what they didn't say
surprisingly is that this is actually
the first pci express based SSD that
brings the price point down to something
that would make it actually a reasonable
replacement for a SATA based SSD so the
Revo drive uses an onboard raid 0 PCI
Express just basically it's just a
little RAID controller chip I'll show it
to you once we've actually got this open
and I can show you the drive itself so
all it's really doing is it's taking
more flash chips and it's running them
with two controllers and just running it
in raid 0 and then instead of having to
deal with the bottleneck of the SATA 2
interface OCZ hooks you up with a little
RAID controller and a PCI Express
interface and that's how you get all
that performance out of it so here I'll
here hold on let's see what's included
with it first under gear is nothing
comes in
package here okay they got a little my
SSD is faster than your hard drive which
is true in 99.99999 percent of cases
SSDs are much faster than hard drives
here's a quick installation guide a
locate a slot put it in how to boot to
the Revo drive okay and installing
windows on your Revo drive fairly
straightforward so the only extra step
you really need to do with a Revo drive
are to configure it to be bootable which
is basically like configuring any RAID
controller to be bootable and then you
just need to install the RAID controller
driver when you're installing windows
which is actually with Windows Vista and
Windows 7 dead easy so pretty much
anyone should be able to use one of
these for their boot drive this is a
full-height card okay
span I'm just gonna show you all the
main components here so first of all
this oh wow look at that they've
actually got a wire soldered on here so
I guess they made a last-minute PCB
revision and looks like they actually
had to do some custom wiring now
something to be aware of is that this
will not cause any long-term effects
because really a wire running on the
outside of the PCB is exactly the same
as any other trace or a wire running on
the inside of the PCB but I was just I
was a little bit surprised to see that
very cool okay so here we have you know
what this may actually be the I believe
it's a silicon image RAID controller
chip let me see if it actually says on
their box I hope it does because I hate
to I hate to not know
uh-oh well not a whole lot I can do
about it but I believe this is actually
a PCI raid chip
I believe this chip is actually a PCI
Express to PCI bridge chip and then
these are two SandForce SSD controllers
so what happens is the PCI Express
interface here is converted into a PCI
compatible signal but you still get all
of that bandwidth okay this this one is
running RAID between the two SandForce
controllers so basically you see this
okay we've got eight here and then eight
chips on the back so sixteen chips those
ones are running off this SandForce
controller and then the other sixteen
chips on the PCB are running off the
other SandForce controller so that means
that you get effectively double the
total performance double the total
bandwidth out of a Revo drive that you
do out of a single SandForce SSD so
basically if you if you cut this up like
this and then stuck a SATA 2 controller
on there then that that would be it that
would be once and for space SSD so ocz
with a little bit of extra cost a little
bit of engineering know-how has turned
it into something that you can just plug
in and you're running raid zero with
just one thing pretty cool it's not
really that different from what they've
done in the past with the C Drive the
biggest difference is that now it's
affordable anyway I wouldn't be really
doing my job unless I told you what the
performance numbers are like so with 4k
random writes they're promising up to
75,000 IAP s-- and with sustained reads
and sustained writes up to 540 megabytes
per second read and 480 megabytes per
second right peak and then 400 megabytes
per second sustained right so these are
huge performance numbers and I think
we've had a pretty good look at the Revo
drive and one thing that OCC has figured
out that it seems like a lot of other
companies don't is performance parts
should have a black PCB thank you for
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
