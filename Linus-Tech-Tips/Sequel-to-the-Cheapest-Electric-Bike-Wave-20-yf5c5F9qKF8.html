electric bikes about their way beach
cruiser which claims to be the world's
most affordable a bike ever at 599 USD
for early backers available through
IndieGoGo it seemed too good to be true
and it was the wave 1.0 was a terrible
bike with a shady crowdfunding campaign
but more on that later so they've sent
us to follow up the wave 2.0 is it the
improvement they need to relearn
consumer trust or is it just a slightly
less terrible bike with a slightly less
terrible marketing strategy
Tunnel bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open internet Tritonal
therefore free at the link in the video
description the wave 2.0 is a non
crowdfunded bike that is currently
listed on wave electric bikes website
for $1000 the box comes with a big red
warning stating that professional
assembly is required if you don't opt
for the $95 charge in the checkout to
have someone come and do it for you
though the included instructions seemed
pretty clear to me
so I apparently took my life into my own
hands by putting it together myself I
guess I won't be able to make any
warranty claims now that it's assembled
let's see what we've got the wave 2.0
features a 750 watt brushless hub motor
6 speeds and a reported 25 mile per hour
top speed with 23 miles of range using
the throttle only and 40 miles with
pedal assist these numbers are likely
thanks to the 500 watt hour battery with
Samsung's cells and the aluminum frame
both of which are big upgrades over the
wave 1.0 s generic cells and steel frame
and my real-world numbers actually get
reasonably close to those I've got to
give them credit for that considering
that wave electric bikes obtained these
numbers with a 165-pound rider on
perfectly flat terrain with no stopping
but electrical components aside as a
bike the wave 2.0 just feels kind of
cheaply made the handlebars have a lot
of play no matter how much you tighten
everything it doesn't come with fenders
or a quick-release on the front wheel
the pedals are plastic the brakes squeak
horribly when wet the motor shudders
that it starts up the luxury stitching
on the handlebar grips is already coming
undone the pic stand has already broken
my battery case arrived with a crack in
it and the rack is useless to hold any
panier bags because the battery is
completely in the way unless you raise
it slightly with washers like I did that
would have cost them what 25 cents
furthermore there's no decelerate
curve for the motor controller so it
abruptly cuts in and out as you go below
and above 20 miles per hour the only way
to avoid this is by switching the bikes
to off-road mode which instantly removes
the speed limitation and allows the bike
to put up full power regardless of speed
making it very explicitly not
street-legal in parts of the United
States and Canada make of that what you
will not everyone is concerned that
their vehicle isn't street-legal one
thing I do like about it is the fact
that the front and rear lights are both
powered by the main battery and can be
turned on and off with the press of a
button though I wish they were
significantly brighter and the
complaints don't end there the LED
display has no odometer wattmeter
speedometer or estimated remaining range
it just has readouts for battery and
pedal assist levels and if you want no
pedal assist you have to turn the entire
thing off for some reason also it can be
difficult to distinguish the buttons or
the LEDs from one another especially if
you're wearing gloves
so overall the wave 2.0 is just a
cheaply made bike I wouldn't pay a
thousand dollars for it and neither
should you
so what happened here why is it so lame
well ladies and gentlemen I did promise
to look into the history of wave
electric bikes and Wow did I dig up some
dirt the IndieGoGo campaign for the wave
1.0 e bike ultimately raised 1.1 million
dollars and once they had the money
their promises began slipping away
delivery dates were pushed back multiple
times
the Samsung batteries were changed to
generic cells the one-year warranty
vanished the promise top speed and total
range were decreased when the bikes
finally started shipping customers
received parts that were damaged
incorrect non-functional or just missing
in all fairness some customers are happy
with their purchase but many are not and
these folks are still posting angry
comments on the IndieGoGo page demanding
refunds and decrying the lack of
communication from wave electric bike
I spoke to my contact about all of this
and he said that we definitely had some
issues but we were able to resolve these
issues and produce the wave 2.0 without
any of these issues really what brand of
alternative facts are these because more
than one and a half years later some of
the original backers have still not
received their wave 1.0 bicycles and it
gets a lot worse while the campaign was
still active someone posted this image
comparing the wave 1.0 e bike to a
seemingly identical bike from
alibaba.com
available for $400 but upon closer
examination it's yeah it's exactly the
same bike turns out there's a company
that's literally called om bicycle that
sells these bikes in lots of 100 and
they told me they've been doing so since
2014 before the wave indiegogo campaign
even launched and they're currently
doing the exact same thing with the lady
wave or should I say the OEM en1 five
one nine four that would be pretty
disturbing since reselling a product is
against IndieGoGo Terms of Service
digging deeper I found this forum post
which points out similarities between
waves branding and music taken from rad
powered bikes and I also discovered that
waves logo is almost identical to wave
broad bands logo is there anything they
didn't rip off my contact at Wave
electric bikes denies that any of these
things are ongoing problems and even
says that it's the Alibaba vendors who
are copying wave and not the other way
around and that wave 1.0 customers and
wave 2.0 customers are completely
unrelated whatever that means
because I don't agree it looks like the
wave 2.0 has the same frame design brake
LED display battery case motor and motor
controller as the wave 1.0 I wouldn't be
surprised if om bicycle or some other
Chinese vendor is still supplying wave
electric bikes with parts or even entire
bicycles but because the wave 2.0 is not
crowdfunded there's not
wrong with this and lots of Chinese
products are marked up and resold for
much higher margins than what I believe
wave is taking but none of that changes
that the wave 2.0 is a cheap bike sold
by a sketchy company with a track record
of disappointing and misleading its
customers they say they've moved on to a
different business model but some of the
wave 1.0 backers and all of the lady
wave backers have still not received
their bikes despite the fact that you
can currently buy them straight from
wave electric bikes calm which is making
the backers very upset which leads us to
a pretty clear conclusion there are some
significant and unavoidable costs
associated with building a good ebike so
you're probably not going to find one
for less than $1000 if that's too
expensive for you my completely unbiased
advice is to just get yourself a regular
bike from a well-established brand like
specialized giant or Trek or you could
get a moped or even a fixer-upper
motorcycle if you're mechanically
inclined just don't buy anything from
wave electric bikes at least until
they've made things right with their
current outstanding IndieGoGo supporters
and always remember kids if a
crowdfunding campaign looks too good to
be true it probably is
