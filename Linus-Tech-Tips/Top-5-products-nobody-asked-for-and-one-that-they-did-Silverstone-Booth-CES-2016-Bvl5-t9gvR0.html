Media Group to be here at CES 2016
covering the show so let's kick this
video and the Silverstone suite off with
a little thing that I call five products
that nobody asked Silverstone to make
and I'm gonna open things up with this
my friends right here this is the DIY
wireless card kit were you thinking to
yourself gee I need a wireless card for
my desktop that plugs into a PCI Express
1x slot with a couple of antennas on the
back but I'd really rather buy a laptop
card and put that on a desktop thing and
then put that in my computer
Silverstone's got you covered
next up if you were thinking yourself
gee I really wish I had a PCI Express
card I could put in my computer that
would tie into my power and reset
switches and then a little fob that I
could keep on my keychain to hard reset
my computer from anywhere within a 20
meter radius Silverstone's got you
covered on that too and then a few
things yourself gee what about this what
if I had a computer fan that could spin
in both directions depending on my mood
or the Chi of the room or the orbital
pattern of Jupiter Silverstone has got
you covered on that too but then what if
you were thing to yourself gee my SFX
tiny form-factor computer well that 600
watt power supply wasn't enough now they
have a 651 now with 92 millimeter fan
also fully modular and then they've got
this thing which can jump-start your car
a couple of times and it's a Qualcomm
quick charge 2.0 battery charger thing
as well okay I snuck that one in because
I do have one more making it a total of
six but it's worth the extra one because
this my friends
the mammoth series military-grade ip65
waterproof hard drive enclosure that
takes your 2 and a half inch drive and
makes it literally the size of a three
and a half inch hard drive but also
happens to be shockproof and waterproof
this could have you covered but what
about that product I promised to show
you guys that someone did ask
Silverstone to make that's here too this
my friends is something I am person
extremely excited to see this is pretty
much the final version of what you guys
even calling it the EBA 0-2 thank you
it's a good name the EBA 0-2 the
wall-mounted headphone stand that was
designed as part of a Linus tech tips
community project where we had hundreds
of 3d modeled designs that were then 3d
printed by my mini Factory comm and
submitted to me for judging then to
Silverstone to figure out how to
manufacture it and it is actually real
it's actually here it is a two-piece
design with the one that goes on your
wall that's screwed in with three screws
and then another one that slides in with
the most satisfying listen to it it's
absolutely gorgeous it feels beautiful
and it's coming soon hopefully somewhere
in the sort of Lake 60 to 70 dollar
price range MSRP it's gonna be available
in at least two colors but they've got
that exclusive gold color that was
originally only gonna go to the winning
design but there's been some
complications with how the the judging
was done we picked one thing it turned
out it was very very difficult to
manufacture we ended up going with this
so every one of the finalists is now
going to be receiving a gold color of
the finished product so this this is
freaking awesome guys this is basically
the solution to getting your headphones
off your desk and mount it on your wall
if you want a really clean looking
workspace or play space or whatever else
your space may be speaking of space
squares to actually no we're not ready
for that just yet I have one more thing
no one asked Silverstone to make braided
aluminum capped USB cables this one has
a reversible a connector and a lightning
on the other end kind of cool this one
this one's really cool this one has
reversible a on one end reversible
micro-b on the other end so you can for
your Android phone plug in any
orientation you want and then
this one this is like really cool I like
this one this one Falls more into the
who asked for this sort of category
where we've got a reversible micro B on
the one end cool then we've got an A on
the other end that can be converted to a
non reversible micro B and they're like
well what about like on the go or like
charging one phone off of another one
I'm like okay okay okay okay if you
build it they will come I guess speaking
of building it build it beautiful our
