DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts welcome to my
review of the audio technica ath AG ones
so let's start with a physical overview
yeah they absolutely nailed the looks of
these things in my opinion matte black
with gold accents that look sharp and
hint at the high performance nature of
the product without turning into the
over-the-top gamer bling very very nice
the ear cuffs themselves have a soft
fabric on the inside to cushion your
earlobes against the angled drivers
inside the ear cups and feature a padded
pleather outer cushion that is very soft
against the skin while not necessarily
being the most realistic feeling faux
leather that I've ever encountered the
3d wing headband design boasts
convenient no adjustments necessary
compatibility with any head and like
anything designed to be one size fits
all doesn't fit perfectly on everyone
personally I found it made me acutely
aware of the two spots on my head where
the weight of the headphones were
hanging but at least due to the
lightweight design of the AG ones it
didn't cause me any discomfort even
after a couple hours of continuous use
the other issue for me with these is
that they just plain don't stay on for
me the left side of the headset is
slightly heavier than the right side due
to the cable and the microphone so I
found that that side sags more than the
other side and because the materials on
the top pads in the ear cups while soft
and cushiony and nice are also a little
bit slippery they don't really do
anything to help them stay on there is
an easy fix however a band-aid solution
if you will just put an elastic band
between the wings like so you'll have to
experiment with the right size elastic
and I found that once I found the
perfect elastic it addressed all the
issues that I had with them and they
were both comfortable and stayed on just
fine
one way Audio Technica could fix this
for me would be to include some
tasteful black or gold elastics that
come with the headphones I can try it
whichever one fits perfectly for me so I
don't need to use some jenkki solution
but on a future product I just much
rather have a full headband for comfort
and convenience I mean lots of gamers
that I know hang their headsets around
their necks or pull one ear off to hear
the things around them and I found that
around the neck puts the plastic support
bars directly against your neck oops and
taking off one ear cup makes them
basically fall right off for me another
oops the good news is that the elastic
that I needed to make them stay on my
head in the first place also helps with
these issues while I'm picking on the
ergonomics of the product though I wish
that the mic had a wider range of motion
it's a hundred degrees as it is so that
it's not always kind of hanging in my
peripheral vision when I'm not using it
I mean this last complaint in particular
looks like it could be very easily
addressed simply by removing a little
plastic stopper here so that it folds up
a little bit higher it comes with a one
meter cable pre-attached that terminates
in a 4-pole connector for compatibility
with mobile devices or the included USB
sound card and it is not detachable but
it is very robust feeling so I doubt it
will ever need to be replaced and I'd
rather have a solid pre-attached cable
than a proprietary or fragile removable
one if I had any complaints about the
cable would be that perhaps it's a
little bit too stiff and another 8 to 12
inches of length would help me get it
not only to the front audio connector
but also kind of you know routed a
little bit further down so it's not
anywhere near my arms especially if my
tower is next to me Audio Technica does
include a 2 meter extension that splits
into 2 3 poles to work with your analog
sound card and to help you reach around
to the back of your computer but it
doesn't address folks who might want to
use the surprisingly decent USB sound
card that can easily drive these
headphones past comfortable audio levels
without Distortion but have it in the
back of their system where they can't
see it because these don't go in here so
a 4-pole extension with a small pigtail
adapter would have been a more versatile
solution allowing front analog rear
analog front USB and rear USB operation
all without a trip to the store for an
extra adapter back to the mic for a
moment it is a very
premium feeling the flexible boom is
outstanding it can be easily positioned
exactly where you need it this is a big
complaint I have about a lot of
microphones and not this one it also
features a nearby a mute button that's
nice and easy to reach but is
unfortunately not automatically
triggered when you move the microphone
up out of the way like some other
headsets in this price range now let's
move on to listening tests all listening
tests were done on a stack in a
titanfall game stream or with my usual
mix of top 40 music and I'll say this
the AG ones have a much more balanced
frequency response than you'll typically
find on a gaming headset nice accurate
and clear highs rich mids and punchy
strong but not overpowering lows I
haven't tried the open back ath a DG
ones but man I don't think I care even
though I got the closed version it's
amazing how natural they sound they do
such a great job of not making me feel
like I'm in a tiny little cave with a
plastic speaker mounting apparatus
clamped to my head I mean sure that's
what's actually going on here but that
doesn't mean I want to confront that
reality I'm in my zone right and even
more impressively because of their da
DSR double their damping system they
don't leak sound that translates into
better positional audio because your
left ear can't accidentally hear right
channel sound and more immersive gaming
since you'll never be bothered by
annoying spouses children pets and I
mean hell the apocalypse could probably
happen with these on and I wouldn't
notice that either the other real world
benefit of their isolation is that you
also won't bother those other folks with
whatever you're listening to whether
it's games or music now because of their
price they end up in side-by-side
listening tests against some tough
competition though by comparison the AKG
K 702 s are much harder to drive having
much higher impedance and similar bass
response but lacks some oomph in the
mid-range and have more Sparkle at the
high end something that some people
prefer but passed a certain point I find
fatiguing to listen to I do prefer a kgs
suspension headband implementation but I
really do not prefer the hard foam that
they use on the ear cups compared to
this nice soft stuff I also dug my PC
350 s which are still quite similar to
the current ma
high-end clothes back from Sennheiser
out of a bin where I found them at
Luke's place he's so fired mids were
strong on these similar to the 80s but
the highs were comparably vailed
something that may be an issue when
pinpointing in-game sounds and their
bass while strong and punchy only really
delivers if I press them against my head
to seal them because I think Sennheiser
was designing these for elves these are
also really hard to drive for a gaming
headphone my last competitor is the DT
770's from Bayer dynamic and it's
obvious why these have such a good
reputation I've got the ADM impedance
version and apart from being much more
difficult to drive I'm sounding a little
bit Basinger they were I'd say equally
pleasing to listen to noise isolation is
not as strong though and this is likely
partly due to the cloth ear cups and
obviously they have no included mic or
included USB soundcard but then again
they are less expensive overall now
speaking of the included mic let's get
into microphone quality this headset
will be the first entry into our new
standardized mic testing system I'm
going to record 3 test phrases on an
asus thunder FX external sound card one
like i'm having a conversation with
someone on skype one like i'm excited in
the middle of a game and one like i'm
speaking quietly so as not to wake the
baby i'm going to link to these sound
clips in the video description for your
convenience though here is a clip from
this headset that should basically make
you want to go buy it right now holy
actual balls the mic on the ag-1 is
unreal if you didn't tell me this mic
was integrated on a gaming headset I
would believe it was a much more
expensive standalone solution Bravo
Audio Technica
I guess that's what some audio
engineering expertise brings to the
gaming headset scene so the conclusion
for this product is this great first
attempt Audio Technica took a new market
one that they admittedly haven't
addressed before and designed a product
for it that is really solid it sounds
great in games I mean good headphones
sound good in games and will satisfy all
but the most discerning audio files when
it comes to music enjoyment as well and
I mean when I say discerning I don't
mean in terms of quality they sound
great it's just that some people prefer
a slightly different sound signature for
music enjoyment versus gaming that's all
they've got a fantastic microphone on
here and apart from
view Argonaut complaints which I covered
pretty thoroughly in the video this is
pretty much as good as I could expect a
gaming headset to be the drawback I mean
well it's linked in the video
description if you want to buy one but
prepare yourself because the price tag
reflects the premium quality of the
product is price they are very expensive
but sometimes you get what you pay for
speaking of getting what you pay for
audible.com I swear with over a hundred
and fifty thousand audiobooks available
to download at a moment's notice and
listen to on your phone or in your car
on your headphones see how these things
went together so nicely sorry I got
distracted there all the point is that

Doctor Who dead air that is not only
about the Tenth Doctor but also happens
