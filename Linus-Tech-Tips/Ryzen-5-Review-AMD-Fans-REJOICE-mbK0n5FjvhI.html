patiently hurt impatiently for its big
debut something which we are what up
you're gonna get rekt look at these
comments what is this who are you huh
I'm I'm you from the future if you
release this simulation of AMD rise and
performance everybody's going to hate
you simulation what simulation I've got
rising five right here no you don't
understand I just wait this is the
review Great Scott
I've gotta go I set the dial wrong
welcome then to our risin 5 review
we're opening up a new merch store you
can check out some of our new gear today
at the link in the video description as
we've mentioned before AMD is
aggressively targeting Intel in terms of
core count and pricing packing
enthusiast features into their CPUs in
order to undercut Intel's Core i5 and
core i7 with them appropriately named
Rison 5 and rise in 7 CPUs whether they
succeeded or not will address a little
bit later because first we need some
boring technical details both rise in
seven and rise in 5 which launches today
come with 2 of what AMD calls CPU
complex or CC X's which is for
processing course attached to 8 Meg's of
high-speed cache these CCX units
communicate with each other over an
all-new bus that AMD calls infinity
fabric the difference between them is
that Rison v comes with two or four
individual course disabled through a
process called binning whereby faulty or
underperforming cores are shut off then
the chip is sold at a lower price so if
we line up our rise in 5 and rise in 7
CPUs we can see that our 1600 X is
basically a cut-down 1800 X while our
1500 X is probably a cut-down 1700 with
tweak'd clock speeds what's unusual
about AMD's approach here though is that
they've disabled the course
symmetrically to make hex core and quad
core models the disadvantage is that the
quad core model may suffer some
performance penalty for not having all
of its course on the same CC X but the
advantage is that every Rison 5 gets a
sit sixteen megabytes of cash and all
the other features are there to
precision boost
xfr simultaneous multithreading
neural net inspired branch prediction so
when you start to think about it then
how many cores do you really need and if
the answer is any fewer than eight then
rise in five starts to sound like a
really good way to save a few bucks
let's talk about the test
AMD included an msi be 350 12 other
board in our testing kit but we used our
crosshair 6 hero instead for the sake of
consistency and on that subject
we actually retested all of our AMD
chips with the latest bios revision and
a new kit of g skill flare x ram which
means that we are finally able to give
you guys results at ddr4 3200 speeds
this along with the rest of our tests
table should give us a great picture of
how rise in 5 stacks up for extra credit
we also tested our rise in 5s with a 4
gigahertz overclock the best that we
could achieve on both of the chips with
air cooling oh and by the way our
simulated 1600 X we threw that in there
too let's kick things off with gaming
thanks to their native overclocking
support both of our rise in 5 chips
managed to pull off some impressive
numbers next to their team blue
competitors although it is worth noting
that the 7600 K can overclock to games
like rise of the Tomb Raider and doom in
OpenGL mode tend to devour instructions
per clock giving our Intel benches a
lead unless we overclock on Rison
which sometimes actually accounts for
some major gains in performance here now
that's weird
what gives with Team Blue your cache is
generally going to remain at the same
speed unless you
overclock it separately but as it turns
out rise ins cash just loves getting as
much CPU time as it can which favors
their infinity fabric connected CCX
architecture along with their high core
counts so with many cores and higher
clock speeds
AMD's cache actually becomes more
efficient how do we know because when we
compared cache benchmarks between our
stock and overclocked chips we found
major improvements thanks to our over
clocks that look in line with the
differences between the two chips core
counts I mean overclocking our 7700 K we
saw performance fluctuate a bit but
nowhere near this much so this seems to
explain some of what we're seeing here
in these gaming tests good news for AMD
fans looking to overclock then because
overclocking adds to multiple
performance metrics speaking of which in
our synthetic tests we can see that
Rison continues to dominate intel's
mainstream platforms when it comes to
multi-threaded performance what's even
more interesting about these results
however is that the rise in seven 1,700
frequently ends up matched by our
overclocked 1600 X which becomes all the
more impressive when you consider the
performance per dollar that this
translates to thanks to the $80 price
difference between the two chips
speaking of performance per dollar team
red and team blue are neck and neck in
this all-important metric a small aside
here by the way if you've been paying
attention our simulated risin 5 1600 X
has also kept up very well with our real
1600 X finally let's talk about thermals
something we weren't able to simulate
now that we're equipped with AMD's
Wraith Max and Wraith spire coolers we
can test our risin 5 chips with both
stock and aftermarket cooling so for
giggles we threw our
I are on our overclock 1600 X and
managed to maintain our performance at
reasonable if unexceptional temperatures
so aftermarket cooling is still
recommended for overclocking even on
rise ins four and six core variants
which leads us to our conclusion then
since its launch
AMD's new platform has been changing
almost daily we're constantly learning
new things about how it does perform how
its supposed to perform and why and with
Rison five ambhi's future becomes much
clearer thanks to software and firmware
updates that continue to improve rise
ins performance and stability with these
numbers and pricing Intel may be
starting to sweat a little bit remember
too that we used an X 370 board but you
could save a fair bit on the platform
overall by stepping down to be 350 if
you don't need SLI or even lower if you
don't plan to overclock now to be clear
Rison doesn't overclock like crazy the
platform bugs aren't quite fully ironed
out and it still isn't that clear of far
and away performance King that a lot of
people wanted it to be but what they
have done when you factor in the entire
suite of tests is deliver just as much
bang for the buck as team blue right now
and that is a very good thing do you
have two computers do you have two
keyboards and two mice all over your
desk so that you can actually use a four
mention two computers well that's dumb
because synergy exists and it allows you
to share one Mouse and one keyboard
seamlessly between two or more computers
so you'll no longer confuse which one is
for which and which one goes with what
one it's awesome they've got a basic and
pro version with a one-time payment for
lifetime access and the features include
clipboard sharing
in the computers dragging and dropping
files between the computers the ability
to set up hotkeys and more it even works
on Windows Mac and Linux and you can use
our link in the video description to
save 25% on synergy today so thanks for
