experiments with alex i super don't know
why this is here is that the macbook pro
2018 does a pretty subpar job of keeping
its core i9 cpu cool if you opted for
the tricked out core on i model well we
think we can fix that using the same
cooling principles as we were able to
fix the razor phone and its throttling
while gaming with that is to say liquid
metal cooling but then there's also like
a radiator and a reservoir and some
laptop stands and some water blocks so i
have no idea what this is going on today
why don't we all find out together
Kable mods configurator now includes a
customizable RGB backplate that can
enhance the look of your GPUs and SSDs
it's compatible with our sync RGB fusion
mystic light sink or kala mods own kit
find out more at the link below you
pulled out all the stops like there's
two iFixit kids yeah what are we doing
oh I actually just had a difficult time
getting it open so I thought that I
might have like stripped one of the
screws but it's actually just the peas
and not the tea's so I was just an idiot
so step one of any cooling project is
wasn't me rip open the device you're
trying to cool so I will take you up on
one of these kits these things are kind
of nerve-wracking to open cuz they're
five grams yeah five brandish like it
looked so much easier and I fix its
video how do they do that
are you free yes there we go beautiful
you can really tell what gives it the
rigidity though yeah that's pretty nice
this make a computer case out of a small
block alone what are inches bits would
you go through so you want to know my
really bad idea that probably won't work
sure you want a water cool it yeah I
really don't know if this is a very good
idea I don't even see how the heat pipe
comes off to be perfectly honest with
you usually you have to take the whole
board off and the screws are on the
other side okay so what are we taking
off no I'm trackpad first I think you
have to take the trackpad out
how are we keeping track of the list I'm
placing them in here
hi we'll be back so lower are these
points trackpad upper are these ones
trackpad flippy chums
also there's T for s and T fives in here
that's I'll just draw the fans on there
yeah that pretty self-explanatory yep
it's got a bigger head uh where'd those
two come out of was right here and right
here okay what was the purpose of this
screw being shorter there's plenty of
room for it to go further if it needed
to oh they're just a different screwed
up defense crew thank you track I don't
know how you're not getting it with the
t43 all these have to come out oh my god
yeah right oh my god is this yet gonna
this is yet another different screw holy
ball sack so that's top left and there's
more Henry then oh wow so this little
thing hooks on a little thing here then
goes down to why you do this I think
this whole thing is a mistake thank you
I think now I just kind of wanted to go
back together and work
I think we're close I'm starting to
think we need to do away with the grand
plans of water cooling and whatever this
is oh it would be so fun fun fun yes are
you having fun how many types of screws
does it take to get to the fun 16 I
think we're just gonna have to peel off
the adhesive just like oh there must be
a ribbon under there
real yeah look there's a ribbon right
here we're just the mystic super-small
there we go now we can probably lift it
up this way that's it this is a royal
pain in the ass
I actually feel legitimately very bad
for people whose job is to fix mac books
all day that's their cooling solution
yeah no wonder the thing thermal
throttle how much does it even weigh I
actually want to know okay never mind
what I have this thing for your drugs
fifty three or four ish grams by
contrast a desktop processor would get a
cooling solution that weighs in the
neighborhood of 1.2 kilos that's a
pretty excessive cooler but yeah okay
that's true I don't even think liquid
metal is gonna solve this wait no it'll
help like that looks like some not great
thermal paste well we have to try I mean
we don't have to try thank you real
honest tactics we have to try yeah
so it's conformal coating time done
uh-oh wow that's a lot can I help pick
some of that up or you know let's just
spread that around no components are
dying here today you can say with a
straight face that they're not dying
because they're dead already or we might
want to get the heat gun out to try a
bit faster well look at it this way mg
chemicals says that you're supposed to
do three coats but we'll probably be
fine with one really not how painting
things on works that moment when people
are watching a video on YouTube and they
are literally watching us watch paint
dry so this is it
liquid model time yeah do you want to do
it sure
you know hell yeah brother that I'm
gonna prime it to wanna give it down
mistake last week why are you doing that
over the board you have a lot of time
for this
there's a ball with it oh it's kind of
sketch yeah here we go okay we're good
oh there's something there we should get
that I think it'd be easier oh thanks
girl hey if I knew just spreading in a
red bag hey hey actually this may be
even too much Wow
we should do his heart liquid metal
application I bet I've had someone on
the internet would be into it like am I
really a fan of ASMR but I could
probably get into that good for his
heart
you don't want to put on too much
because that if it seems out
[Laughter]
fuck the actual I really want to hear an
ASMR cover of CHOP Sumida this is such a
surprisingly stressful operation
yeah I was expecting you to be more like
a normal laptop that all of the other
laptops that are taking apart and like
boom and like five minutes later you're
done I'd like to think you go a little
more careful even but pretty much still
wonder Rossman didn't think the iMac Pro
would be a big deal they compared to
tooling around with these all the time
it's nothing so we are now liquid metal
and now we have to put this back
together yeah do you remember where the
screws go there was one that went on the
bottom right so we know that was on the
top it was just really hidden it's
possible that there's like this is
similar to tightly no I'm like quite
sure ok so there's nothing that goes in
on the bottom not without permission
anyway right you can put all the
connectors back on that don't go gently
it's that like Dylan Thomas reference
you're still in Thomas call it you don't
get to float a poem if you don't know
who it's fine that's like actually a
rule it's a screw that goes into a screw
it's perception no wonder we couldn't
figure that one out holy crap can you
imagine if we had tried to do this
without the project mat you would have
been so screwed
wow that's really obnoxious like you
have to have this whole thing on what is
this that goes on this little peg here
so you sort of get in position and give
her
fund so unnecessary everything about
this is unnecessary it could just sit on
there and you could just screw it in oh
we probably shouldn't do that quite yet
I want to see it fan spin oh you don't
think that we like you need these to you
I doubt it but let's put them in anyway
look it's not hurt
and it was haha goodness Wow it was
stressful at that moment when the delay
is just I voted too long for comfort so
you need screws in the MacBook for it to
turn on we know that now
what the hell Apple yeah okay maybe it
was just unhappy cuz it tried to resume
from sleep and actually it was like
unplugged for a while in here okay try
pets working shall we get some after
results yes I know what if our operation
was worth the stress and time so not
cool get it cuz it's about the MacBook
Pro alright so we're looking for 1083
1083 is what we had before okay I said
we get like 1600 in the Asus yeah but
that was fully Matata
yeah it doesn't totally count fans
haven't even wrapped up yet are they
working free question 1068
okay that's within regular just hit
again and sure no it's ramping I think
yeah yeah that's right think really
slowly interesting does it normally take
that long to ramp up I think they're
pretty on the go by the end of the
Senate venture on I wonder if the liquid
metal is helping us with that 1086
exactly the similar so okay performance
the same but now let's try the longer
tests normally use the F keys but wait
you don't like the touch bar I really
hate it
bitch Christ and work the blender BMW
test all took 6 minutes and 11 seconds
and with the liquid metal it was 6
minutes and 7 seconds so basically the
same so a big fat waste of time and the
classroom took 22 minutes and 58 seconds
stock it took 19 minutes and 26 seconds
with liquid metal no that's actually
pretty good
that's like 13% faster or something like
that that's like she's like a pretty big
improvement so there was a point to
doing this yeah and then how loud was it
towards the end of that second test
there like spooky quiet almost well
that's fantastic so once again liquid
metal
saves the day and once again we are not
recommending that you try this at home
this actually comes in the box
of the liquid metal we don't recommend
doing this because the risk of damaging
your Hardware during the disassembly the
application of the liquid metal and the
reassembly is quite high not to mention
that we have definitely voided the
warranty on this machine in the process
and the the benefit is maybe 10% to 15%
faster renders which is actually pretty
sick but over time liquid metal does
actually need to be periodically
reapplied and that's not a great user
experience No
no it's not I'm just really sad that we
can't put blowing the trots on the
bottom yeah me too we'd have to like
actually cut holes in it because of the
whole case extrusion stuff trees and
stuff master op is back with another
deal this time on the Sennheiser
open-back HD v 8x Jubilee headphones
these were tuned by Axel Braille of
Sennheiser and mass drop based on
feedback from the community they feature
new 150 ohm drivers and a colorway
inspired by the HD v ATS they're clear
fast with a dynamic sound profile and
they've got a glossy black headband
elliptical ear cups and replaceable soft
the lure ear pads they've got a
detachable 6 foot cable and you can get
yours today at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if you disliked this video then you
probably work at Apple but if you liked
it and you like our fix for the MacBook
Pro and its thermal issues you can hit
that like button get subscribed and
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff we featured at the link below
so well maybe we'll have a MacBook down
there love some thermal Grizzly down
there Achtung Oso surface slap up in
there too while you're down there we'll
also have linked our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
