to ask me if we're talking about it then
I guess we're pretty much talking about
it no we're not no no we're not
Oh what well what is it well I can't
what no you can't we're live now you
can't tease me like that you can't be
like hey are we gonna talk about and
then just they're here it's embarrassing
Oh like that yeah I actually have no
idea great show this week yeah it might
not be the LAN show like somewhere
someone will have a great show I'm
looking at the show on my laptop and it
looks so oversaturated the problem is
that we're using a gaming monitor Oh
calibration that's our issue that's
where we're running into trouble here so
we've been so first why so much first of
all our camera people came in and
cranked a Blackmagic Cinema Camera to
1600 ISO so it basically don't properly
lit room my shirt just looked like it
looked like a bunch of like little bugs
crawling around on my shirt because of
all the noise and then we tried to fix
it ourselves which resulted in the
visual feast in front of you today
it's very saturated feast so that's that
that's where we're at on this all right
what do we what do we got for topics is
there anything worth listening to or
should people just tune out now
no they should definitely stay tuned
there's there's a couple things that I
think will be relatively interesting the
first topic I don't think is that
interesting there's there's an LG
giveaway that we can talk about yeah you
can get some LG stuff that's cool
actually you can get a whole gaming
slash workstation machine should we just
do that now
sure okay so last chance to enter the
hive mind PC giveaway sponsored by LG
the winner gets a PC with an estimated
value of about $2,000 depending on which
parts the audience chose as a whole oh
so it's like a voting thing I
okay you also get an LG 38 wk 95 C
monitor so this is a 38 inch 38 40 by
1600 ultra wide so we're looking for
ideas on how to spice up the build and
the stream so I will be streaming the
build of it live that's fun and then one
lucky winner will get exactly that
machine so it's worldwide with no age
restriction how the heck are they doing
that that doesn't that doesn't sound
like something that big companies with
legal departments normally do so here's
a link in the twitch chat to where you
guys can go check out the gleam io
information about it including Quebec I
guess which never happens
entries closed at midnight Pacific
tonight June 29th so don't miss it
um what else we got
g-sync HDR modules at $500 to the
maunder price g-sync is expensive this
said more breaking news that I think we
already knew g-sync normal modules for
300 bucks so the fact the price went up
should not be super surprising great
news great news
YouTube experiments with custom
thumbnails just coming in saving the day
thank you again YouTube Thank You
YouTube I was great I actually had a
call with YouTube today and like out of
respect for my partner manager I won't
discuss any of the like specifics of my
call because I am very appreciative that
YouTube talks to me yeah because they
are not always that communicated be
surprised if that's a relatively new
thing yeah it's it's it's amazeballs but
I will say that the tone of the call on
my side was very grateful I'm grateful
to youtube and our Google overlords for
making our job at floatplane media
easier so much easier um there's also
rumors cuz you all know I love rumors of
an i 999 hundred K I almost wish they
went just for full full gold and when I
999 99 K well it'll be over nine
thousand that's fair invidious new NDA
requirement to get access to early
hardware is this a giant scandal or a
mountain being
made out of a molehill not even a
molehill more on this at 11:00 it's like
one speck of dope no at 11:00 okay no
that's it I'm rolling the interim 11 did
you see that I haven't actually
absolutely like exactly what I wanted to
make oh really
literally hit I use twitch so little and
their settings menus are garbage that
you I love you twitch but your settings
menus are I just watch s oh right oh I
forgot to what so Luke doesn't
technically work here but yeah you're
gonna be at ulti X right yeah Luke will
be at Elte X because Luke also
technically does do things here
sometimes yeah so you have a video
coming soon
I do like actually soon now and not just
like me hosting a video and like pulling
Luke into it for like color commentary
like Lucas is hosting the Nintendo lab
oh
video the latest possible no one cares
anymore about it but these are the
reasons why people should have cared
nintendo lab a video that's quite a
sales pitch alright so what basically
the whole internet is wrong about lab oh
and nintendo now you're getting back
into the clickbait spirit I knew you had
it in you yeah so let's jump into our
first topic this was trusted by one
otology um this the study of people
named Juan yes one otology over on the
forum the original article here is from
tech power up in videos g-sync HDR
module is this was just working you saw
me test this I actually didn't but I
believe you know I know agent you've got
it on Luke's no but that's the one that
was work there we go okay did you try
unplugging it and plugging it back in
yes yes I know okay you're right thanks
bye wait half of my calls to tech
support ever really happened maybe not
half I don't call tech support
that much that's fair but if we're going
back to like when I would call tech
support as a teenager if we're talking
about ever I have definitely made my
fair share of have you tried employed
you I must have told you my EVGA call
story rate okay you know what we're
gonna get back to this juicing HDR
module hey now if I told you that one
before with the mineral computer I'm not
actually sure I don't really so we'll
get through part way and I'm sure
there's people here that haven't heard
that you'll probably remember excited I
must have told you at some point the
only time I've ever contacted customer
support from any computer hardware
company ever was EVGA and one time I've
never had to outside of that
everything's always worked or it's been
like clearly my fault because my hand
was covered in oil and I dropped a hard
drive that is not Mac's door that was
the brand of the hard drives fault
because I it hit the ground it's my
fault and he took it and threw it I know
where that's going
I was everyone knows about my mineral a
computer if you don't there's there's
videos of it on the channel you should
check it out it's it's actually a really
funny video in the end but yeah when I
was building it I'm like twelve hours
into this build and it's taken me
forever it's the first time I've ever
built a mineral computer I'm doing a lot
of things for the first time it's
actually only it's probably like the low
double digits of times I built a
computer at all
at this point right and I'm trying to
build a mineral oil one I go through a
lot of hardships including realizing
that due to the fish rocks that I put in
the bottom of the fish tank my power
supply would no longer fit because I did
all the sizing based on no fish rocks
being there and it was like really hard
to clear a spot for it Baba blah blah
blah so I unscrewed the casing on the
power supply figured out that it was
like a wrapped setup so it was screwed
on one side but it wasn't like two
completely separate metal panels mm-hmm
so I had to like tear off the metal that
was there and I ended up only having
like little like wire cutters so I was
able to just get a tiny little snip in
and then I had to literally rip the
metal in half I think you might be the
king of wrong too anyways I got it it
that's why there's like a jagged edge on
one part of that part Luke needs a
condom with
you know goes to the dollar store finds
a balloon and it's like this end looks
big enough surely the other one will
stretch but I get the power supply rips
and it's now and that power supply still
works actually I've used it recently
which is hilarious it's actually pretty
old I'm really surprised it still works
yeah every everything fits I get all the
oil in and I've turned I turned it out I
did the old thing you turn the computer
on before you put it in the case which
is good yeah I did that you didn't
worked fine then I submerged it press
the power button nothing happened and I
just freaked out cuz I'm a kid I don't
have enough money to buy these
components again right no one's gonna
give me a return on oil-soaked component
they sure why it's not gonna happen so
I'm like try that sometime but carry on
I have no idea what's going on I'm
freaking out it's really early in the
morning for whatever I have an EVGA
motherboard for whatever reason I was
like I'm gonna call EVGA tech support I
don't know why I picked that component
yeah cuz it could have been anything
that was I have no idea yeah I just was
like I need to call someone and the dude
on the phone was like really calm and
really patient I felt like I was calling
911 please state your emergency
and I start trying to explain what's
going on and like he finally eventually
I don't know if he's heard of mineral
cooling before at this point or not but
he's like you know what what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna add a note to your account
saying that like if we get any
components in that have a little oil on
it it's okay that was nuts he did that
he actually did that and then he's like
okay I want you to go through like
taking it out and like reseeding some of
the components for me and he stayed on
the freakin line the whole time and I
put him on speaker and I receded a whole
bunch of components I put everything
back in and it turned on and worked that
was like the greatest customer support
call I've ever had in my entire life and
it was basically did you try unplugging
it and plugging it back in yeah that was
where we were going with yes thank you
that only took about 10 minutes
but anyway that was just amazing that
that's I I almost never have customer
support calls but that was I was really
fantastic no one's come close since then
all right
so let's jump over to this g-sync news
basically PC Pro disassembled there are
g swift PG 27 u q because those guys
have balls of steel it's a two thousand
dollar monitor and they found that the G
sink module is a newer version than the
first generation G sink monitors which I
think we've known for like two years
that new G sink like faster G sink was
gonna require a new module
anyway the exact model of FPGA is an
area area anyway 10 G X 480 which is a
high performance 20 nanometer SOC that
provides enough bandwidth and LVDS pins
in order to process this huge 4k 144
Hertz data stream it is sold in low
quantities for $2000 for the FPGA alone
at digi-key and Mouser but assuming that
Nvidia buys thousands PC per suggesting
that the price of this chip alone will
add five hundred dollars to the monitors
bond cost it is further increased by the
three gigabytes of ddr4 memory on the
module and the added licensing fees for
g-sync
so if you mean just the three gigs like
that stuff's expensive right now
that stuff's really expensive right now
so here's the the bizarre thing about
g-sync
is that from the consumer standpoint I
know a lot of people feel very strongly
that Nvidia should just adopt adaptive
sync or free sync and just kind of get
on board with the rest of the industry I
mean they are now up against more than
just AMD like it used to be nvidia vs
AMD g-sync free sync and AMD had a
handful of partners that were that were
rushing free sync monitors to market but
now nvidia is up against a much larger
tide in the end
stree as a whole Samsung is going to be
supporting freesync on upcoming TVs that
to me is huge you combine that with the
free sink support on the Xbox and now
it's like whoa oh oh now hold hold on
just a gosh darn minute whether you have
a PC or whether you have a console yeah
if you want a game on a monitor or on a
TV if you want all of those things and
the ability to interconnect all of them
free sync is the only solution on the
market today it's a probably gonna stay
that way and a lot of people are
assuming that the only reason that
Nvidia would not adopt the
industry-standard solution is in order
to make more money on their licensing
but I'm kind of looking at this going
like hold on a minute if there wasn't
more to it than that
why would Nvidia pay somewhere in the
neighborhood of $500 for these modules
why would they why would they hurt the
competitiveness of g-sync monitors
available on the market if they didn't
have to and then you go you go back
again and you go now okay well hold on a
second here g-sync on notebooks doesn't
have this FPGA so they found a way to do
it with the embedded DisplayPort
connection but not with the standard you
know I think we haven't really done a
guest in a long time
I think this news merits asking Tom
Peterson from Nvidia boy to come on the
show and explain why the actual ball
sack they would spend all this money and
lock variable refresh rate down to this
proprietary solution if there isn't hurt
there oh yeah
because because imagine imagine that
your Nvidia talking to LG or TCL or
Samsung you're talking to a major like
panel and television
facture and you're going have I got a
deal for you we're gonna have you take
your existing scaler I know it's cheap
but you know you're gonna throw that
away okay you're gonna take our scalar
which doesn't have all these fancy
component inputs that people might need
for their legacy devices
it doesn't take six HDMI zin it's pretty
basic we want you to spend $500 on it
sound good
why would they do that if they don't
have to and then why would they go and
put a bunch of RAM on it if they don't
have to is there say okay so I'm used
freesync and aside from some of the
limitations of the early monitors where
the freesync range was not very helpful
like it didn't go down low enough I
don't personally notice a huge
difference like is this the kind of
thing where I have to pull out a phantom
camera in order to see that the
difference in the way the monitors are
refreshing is that something we should
do we should we should talk to Tom
though okay if that's something we
should do then sure but we could get
what we should do from him okay
all right all right I think giving Tom a
chance I'm gonna email him right now no
no I'm emailing him right now can you
guys to come on our show and explain
g-sync this is all in the subject line
got a lot of our viewers I don't worry
this is me asking you guys don't seem
that concerned got a lot of hard work
wondering why it needs $2,000 FPGA and
three gigs of RAM he's legitimately
doing this right now
Linus you know let's try seems to be
asking for it right now thanks Linus
okay yeah formal yeah you know what
I'll throw in the thanks everyone I'll
throw in the things it was still
basically a one-liner yeah but it's kind
of thanks you know it's aunt Tom's and
Tom's Abbi I respect Tom a lot by the
way Tom sounds great super cool it was
the other person included in the email
yeah yeah so if anyone can explain this
to you I think our PR contact gets upset
when I go straight to Tom because tom is
not technically PR or marketing or
anything he's not technically like an
outward facing is really good at it yeah
he's like awesome yeah it's you know I
really want to talk to Tom about it
because he can put something like we are
spending $500 for lols into a
perspective that might make sense yeah
because if there's anything I know about
Nvidia it's that they don't spend money
unnecessarily all right let's jump into
our next topic here this was posted by a
rubber puppy on the forum and I'd like
to open this with a statement from the
current CEO Oh a floatplane media does
floatplane media now or intend in the
future to alter or disfigure in any way
the thumbnail that a creator would
upload to the platform for their viewers
no not only does that seem I'm trying to
be PR happy right here not only does
that seem stupid let's drop the PR
happiness PR but that it literally just
sounds like unnecessary work and we have
a lot of other stuff here so let's let's
jump over to not only do I not get the
point but it sounds like a bunch of work
here's a post from the rail aisle our
sole Garris yeah oh wow I'm not even you
know forget forget that I ever tried
yeah hello team YouTube I would like to
know why are not the thumbnails of the
videos on my channel what happens is
that all my videos had thumbnails and
now they are no longer seen what a
tremendous tremendous concern to have
this is good so to YouTube's credit now
going back to going back to being
appreciative of YouTube for a minute
here to YouTube's credit they replied
Thank You Team YouTube that's actually
surprising to jump I'm not a super huge
fan of their reply we are running a
small experiment we're 0.3
percent of viewers will see an
auto-generated thumbnail instead of your
custom thumbnail okay we're not removing
the ability to create your custom
thumbnail we're just going to show it to
some people we're doing this to gain
insight on auto-generated thumbnails for
the future something to consider too is
0.3 percent sounds automatically like oh
absolutely tiny amount of people but
it's freaking youtube so 0.3 percent is
actually I have no idea but I'm assuming
in the millions of people this is
actually a lot of people it's not a lot
in comparison to the entire whole of
people that use YouTube but it's a lot
of people there's someone with like a
research degree that's going after them
super ham for for not doing this
properly there's the comments on this
Twitter thread are glorious I heard back
from Nvidia already they're saying it
doesn't cost two thousand dollars so
that's good we've we've confirmed now
that they are indeed getting a volume
discount which we assumed before but I
don't have any information other than
that yeah we knew that so I'm just I
just I've replied I'm saying well okay
yes but we like we still want to know
yeah so just come talk to us about
g-sync dude yeah really have to be that
they should be happy any time Tom gets
in front of people they like love and
video more so they shouldn't yeah they
shouldn't be afraid to please just come
and come flex your tech and we can that
can be like part of it but we can talk
about more things all right so there's
so there's a couple things here number
one I personally am of the mind that
point three percent is not that big of a
deal even in the context of a channel
that gets two million views a day which
is where we're kind of sitting these
days we're a little low right now so
hold on per channel yeah but I mean
users times point and that's not I don't
actually think views is the right way to
do it okay they could be whale users but
if distribution not even that because
you're looking at people who it's going
to come down to a choice decision and
with how YouTube's algorithm works right
now if they don't click on your video it
might not come back so you could be
getting cut 0.3 percent of your users
because now they're not clicking on eggs
it looks weird so the impact could be
could be hurt yeah okay so that would be
60,000 views a day it could potentially
hit us four that's assuming that it's
just a one time a one time thing which
is honestly not the end of the world but
60,000 people a day that might not see
your video in sub boxes anymore I'm over
it but I have deeper concerns I have
other concerns my other concerns are to
do with why are they doing research into
auto-generated thumbnails if there isn't
some kind of purpose to the experiment
and the only purpose that I can think of
to say an experiment that goes hey what
would happen if we just used
auto-generated thumbnails instead of
user-created thumbnails is that they are
considering using them yeah that's the
only reason to run this experiment that
makes sense to mine on AI algorithmic
brain question for you I'm gonna almost
flip sides a little bit here yeah would
that be that bad right now we have
clickbait cancer all over thumbnails I'm
leaving that up to the audience so I've
actually brought up our dashboard here
then I'm gonna screen share with you
guys let's go ahead and pop up my screen
here alright so this video right here
went up today high school for gamers
actually this is not our original
thumbnail design for it it originally
had me holding up a legitimate eSports
textbook which was hilarious by the way
look eSports textbook amazing so we've
got a few different options here we've
got two actually did you want to join a
strawpoll tropical and we just need a
couple options do you prefer our custom
one or do you prefer one of the
auto-generated thumbnails so this is
high school for gamers
we've got me standing holding a book in
front of a plant
we've got me standing in sort of a dark
room it's hard to see my face and then
we've got me standing outside of a
building and then we've got sort of
bigger me with people gaming behind me
okay
so there's an example number one we're
gonna we're gonna do a few we're gonna
do a few here oh here let's try this one
this laptop does everything sort of
we've got me holding up laptops we've
got some people sitting around eating
what is presumably cake we've got some
people sitting at a table and we've got
actually me holding laptops okay all
right
but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lead you
guys too much I want you guys to
conclude for me let's try do dual CPU
sockets matter this video didn't perform
very well so maybe we would have been
better off you know I actually don't
mind this one hmm okay
what this one do you thinks do you think
this top one that does suck that's like
yeah that does suck do you think the top
one is the one that it would pick though
I don't know it might just be one of it
might be like random okay let's try why
do we need so many servers okay this one
Wow we would have thought it was a tech
linked episode with Riley with that one
so that would have been zero that's not
great
this is just me and kind of a dark mass
hard to tell anything this is just me
and the editing den it's hard to tell
like having a picture of the server does
seem pretty helpful for this one is
there any other examples you want to you
want to see any people in chat are
saying that they pick the middle film
thumbnail and other people are just keep
on saying that it picks the second one
or the second one is the best bubela
interesting okay all right why is
everyone buying this monitor okay let's
try this one sorry you guys I know this
is taking a little while but this is
this is live research okay so it managed
to grab our end card so that's not
helpful for sure it managed to grab me
standing in the kitchen I am looking at
a monitor though again the second ones
okay though but the second one is okay
it's me sitting there with a monitor in
front of me do you have those straw poll
results yeah um well like how will I end
up spamming them in chat so if you just
go chat okay cool I'm gonna go I'm gonna
go check out chat I'm gonna go grab that
and bring it up oh I missed I clicked it
dang it I thought actually one of the
better ways to do it is to put your
mouse where it will be and then wait for
chat to pump it and then click there
I've actually I've actually found it
works
add solutions for stupid problems okay
so even though we did see some pretty
good examples in there you have
thumbnails that actually looked not bad
80% of you are saying that you would
prefer the custom creator thumbnails at
least in our case and I know that there
are some creators out there that are not
doing a good job superb use of in good
faith creating a thumbnail that is
representative of a content yeah but
still an 80 to 20 percent vote here is a
pretty overwhelming majority it looks
pretty clear to me that you guys have
you guys have spoken someone shot 80% of
chat has bad taste well moving on
actually we should get our we should get
our sponsors out of the way yeah um I
believe one of them is LTX 2018 LTX is
the well that's weird wah wah LTX is the
interactive Meetup and oops meetup and
interactive tech event it'll be on July
14th at the Richmond Olympic Oval here
in Richmond British Columbia Canada
current booths include a blind cable
management competition brought to you by
cable Maude
I want to do that online that's actually
way more interesting Addie Living
workshop so bring your CPUs we will show
you how to deal it them case toss 2.0
now with more safety multi-headed VR a
LAN 10k ultra wide gaming which by the
way is curved I thought it was 12 it was
gonna be 12 K but then we settled on 34
40 by 1440 ultra woods instead of the 4k
ones okay and I will say that it is a
better experience for doing it this way
the extra pixels were not contributing
much and the extra size probably would
have been unnecessary because it already
takes up in a ginormous significant port
have you seen it no it's actually built
oh it will be
they're like it's confirmed now before
we were just kind of hoping Corsair isus
Berto gear cable mod BS mods free geek
alpha cool and ibuypower will all be at
the event with a ton of more brand
sending swag and to give you guys some
idea of the swag NVIDIA has sent six
tight Nexus 610 ATT eyes and a whole
bunch of other stuff so we are actually
thinking they won't sponsor us but
they'll give us stuff to give away
that's actually that's pretty cool I
mean they make LTX pretty sweet yeah so
far two years in a row so what we were
thinking is instead of just doing a
bunch of draws on the stage is that kind
of took forever and was kind of tedious
it dude we're gonna make so many things
there like competitions cool so like the
blind cable management thing you might
win a Titan so we want to drive
participation so that's come hang out
tickets start at $35 Canadian and you
can check them out at the link below or
LTX Expo dot-com oh there's also going
to be custom merch apparently that you
won't be able to get other than at LTX i
want so wow that's kind of a dick move
oh it's an LT x we have lanyards too
right Oh
cheaper Delta X okay cool alright also

tech tips with dashes not possible
alright so that won't be a thing maybe
we should just create our own like multi

lion sec tips.com slash PA
I guess we could do that all right
getting back into the news we actually
have a lot of topics Oh what we did the
beginning yeah bye all right so we've
got some rumors to talk about this was
posted by NumLock 21 on the forum the
original article is from w CCF tech and
i will say that i know anything about
this because i don't which is great
because it means that i can just talk
about the rumors that I've heard this is
probably accurate
yeah there's a rumored core I 9 coming
to Z 390
it's rumored to be an 8 core processor
with 16 threads which is absolutely
killer because for me there's a farm
owner 8 core was really the threshold
that I bumped into when video encoding
mind you this was a while ago it might
have improved since then when video
encoding with GPU assistance in Adobe
Premiere and Adobe Media encoder ok so
if I had a really high speed 8 core that
also had an Intel integrated GPU so I
could use Quick Sync yeah that had the
potential to be the best of all worlds
to your home and six-course wasn't quite
enough so I am really hoping that this
will be apparently their branding at
Quora 9 that's why are they muddying the
waters why didn't they just make
high-end desktop core i9 and mainstream
core i7 ty like what are they doing I'm
excited for mainstream to be 8 core I
think that'll be a really big deal yeah
what's mainstream has been 8 core for
like 3 years that'll be really good for
software development and game
development stuff that'll be very nice I
just my only thing with this is like of
course I don't know well I don't know
they could have stuck with 6 cores I
mean they're 6 course aren't actually
reasonably competitive even with Rison -
oh I don't necessarily mean about the
9900 k to be fair oh I see what you mean
yeah yeah like Intel is making more
browsers oh I see yeah there's
individual details if they're true that
is interesting but it's a rumor so the
rumor is that a core i7 9700 K would be
six core 12 thread direct replacement
for the 8700 K and the 9600 K would be
six core six thread so direct
replacement for the 8600 K what I would
expect and this won't be popular is that
because they are creating a new model
number and they're giving it a core I
nine designation I would expect this to
be positioned as a more expensive option
that we've seen over the last four or
five generations now going from 2,600 K
to 3770k to 4770k to 4790k to 5775 see
hahaha that was short-lived to 6700 K to
7700 K is every generation intel has
bumped the performance by 5 to 10% and
they've put a few bucks on the price how
much do you think it'll cost but
basically not much more than adjusting
for inflation I think this time we are
going to see the top-tier skew on the
mainstream platform cost a significant
amount more I wouldn't be surprised if
instead with rising oh yeah barking up
their tails I think so I don't think
that from Intel's perspective
Rison challenges the mainstream K chips
because their positioning of these chips
is that they're forgiving or 9:9 because
those are crazy expensive yes and no the
cheapest I nines core I nine let's see
well it would be what like an AIDS Oh
hmm 70 is there a 78 something okay
can't remember oh man this is a laptop
chip why do I even why do I even bother
going to Intel's website when there's
Wikipedia oh no okay yeah you're right
Cora 9 start at $1000 that's that's like
not really this one won't be like that
though I think this one will be like
$100 more okay so so far this because
that's a pretty big shift for them yes
it kind of actually makes sense but it's
a big shift yep so I think this will be
like $100 more and I think the
justification will be that this is the
fastest gaming chip and it's also a
really versatile sort of cheap oberek
station chip because you will get to use
the cheaper consumer chipset which does
save you some money
the
all right in videos new NDA requirements
for early hardware this is supposed to
by Athen immortal on the forum and the
original article here was from tech
power up so basically I'm glad we used
the tech powerup article yeah yeah
because they are pretty much they went
full editorial yeah we don't basically
think that that is that big of a deal it
wasn't so social situations very awkward
yeah so German techno plication hisis de
I don't know if I said that right
probably not they felt that this latest
update suggested to them that in video
was mandating positive reviews in order
to get access to hardware they weren't
tech power-up disagrees I disagree I
actually hadn't gotten a copy because
our via contact sent it to Luke sat on
it for weeks instead of paying it's okay
no I gotta follow up a week after the
deadline hey - is anyone from your
organization gonna sign this I never saw
and then I got your forward after I had
sent the sign one zackham already I know
did you if you noticed from the foreword
it was not a reply to the original email
I don't think I got the two week old
email okay and that email was like a day
or two old at that point so anyway it
wasn't that bad I read through it
actually as far as NBA's go it was
pretty plain Jane it was like two pages
didn't have anything terrifying in it
like there's some NDA's out there that
are scary like we're working on getting
this really unique graphics card that
actually outputs over Ethernet yeah
that's super cool
they're nd8 really cool much bigger much
bigger much bigger in videos was
actually for a company that size in
particular like we've worked with some
big multinationals in the past
especially on like sponsored projects
and there's explain here why it's not
that big we do because a lot of people
read it and still thought it was really
bad probably because they're just not
used to reading legalese or NDA's well
it's because the the wording that says
the recipient shall use confidential
information solely for the benefit of
Vidia means that while the product is
nd8
you are not supposed to be safe for
example taking this this unreleased
graphics card and lending it to your
buddy over at AMD so that they can run
benchmarks on it so that they'll know
ahead of time what the performance will
be when the NDA lifts the solely for the
benefit of Nvidia thing also lifts and
besides the interpretation of solely for
the benefit in Nvidia could be very
broadly interpreted like you could say
that constructive criticism is for the
benefit of Nvidia that would be that
would be that would be a fairly easy
legal defense like it's not nearly as
restrictive as as it might be made out
to be and like we you know when Nvidia
does something wrong like for example
their geforce partner program and i
don't feel like we pulled any punches on
mats
luke has made his feelings on GeForce
experience very abundantly clear over
the years which okay I actually I will
take this opportunity to add for them
they've done a huge improvement oh I
know that when you when you no no I
don't use it either but this is that's
the point I'm talking about you know how
before if you did Express install it
would install I actually did notice that
yeah that's actually super cool yeah so
it doesn't make you install it anymore
thank you that's actually awesome i
hammered on them so much about GeForce
experience so I have to give them the
positive kudos at the same time about
making it so that there's now when you
go to the expresstoll it's like express
with the GeForce experience or express
without I did notice that that's a
absolutely totally acceptable good
enough option we've got how about Nvidia
releasing 10 30s with ddr4 memory that's
what you get for buying a 1030
you don't buy low end graphics cards
we've made multiple videos with it here
let's let's just low end graphics gamers
Nexus tomatoe recent one about it - all
you have to do all you have to do is
google it let me google that for you
technically YouTube is Google low end
video cards for it are they still
terrible spoiler yes low end video card
rent and Radeon r7 240 on
boxing in review spoiler yes um most
gamers next to this video I think it's
pretty new it's about the ten thirty or
whatever
dang it switches publisher get your get
your freaking SEO okay there you go
gamers Nexus the disgrace of a graphics
card GT ten thirty TDR for is probably
that video is probably why that person
said that thing into its chat that is my
assumption right but that's what you get
for buying a ten thirty
instead of a last generation 900 series
decent card as far as I know ten thirty
s are for like the person that walks
into Best Buy needs to plug in more
monitors and doesn't know any better
because the cold hard truth and I've got
I've had people it's just completely not
listen so many times to mine and yours
for that matter criticisms of low end
graphics cards saying well some people
just don't have that much money to spend
on a better one then buy used it's like
the whole point of scrapyard wars a lot
of people like we have had very good
experiences with this if you bring your
rig will let you test it just just it
what honestly a lot of the hardware
community these these dudes will even
like let you into their house to where
their computer is to test it there I'm
not being some kind of you know elitist
you know oh well then you should just
spend more on your graphics card that's
not the point no the point is that brand
new garbage is still garbage whereas
used diamonds are still diamonds this
might be a little slightly scratched up
or something I'm I'm getting all mad and
then shouldn't let myself get this
stressed out about it's just stupid I
had someone else witness crap your doors
coming OH two weeks 24.2 flow plane so
it'll be a week after that we had talked
about floatplane being more ready for
prime time by the time scrapyard worse
comes where we add on that
there can I do a big push go sign up for
floatplane it's gonna be amazing
scrapyard horse I'm hoping you guys
ready we have some cool things coming
there's obviously been some minor
shake-up as you've heard of recently and
so we'll have to see how we react to
that but there is some cool things
coming notifications are gonna be
working soon some parts of it are
already working we're not like launching
that part yet until all of it's working
okay
discord integrations and stuff we're
gonna be working soon there's there's
some really cool things coming down the
pipe I suppose if we can get it done
fast you know all right cool I'm excited
you know what I should just I should
just do it
we are gonna we are gonna pimp so much
concern it's frozen did it freeze why is
it frozen why is it frozen there's
dreams Tahoe we're back all right I can
ski dedicated video on the Ltd Channel
20,000 new users are you know I'd the
original article yours from TechCrunch
and this looks pretty cool VR gloves
okay Luke go yes
okay I've wanted this so bad lightest
has been playing this game what what is
the game box VR box VR I trained boxing
in real life two times a week and I have
wanted to do this box VR thing but my
biggest problem with it is that I don't
want to hold the controllers yeah
because I think that would be really
weird I'm I've gotten very used to
boxing with my boxing gloves on and I've
been talking to haven't had the time but
I've been talking to him about how I
want to get another pair of boxing
gloves and mod the vive controller into
the boxing glove and now these guys have
more or less done it for me I'm sure I
can take their design and attach to a
boxing glove super easy very awesome so
in a nutshell they're launching out of Y
Combinator's latest class of startups
with ambitions to bring a low-cost
flexible glove into users hands or onto
them as it were the plexus glove relies
on the existing tracking systems of the
HTC and oculus headsets so the tracking
sensors grab the position of where the
hands are in space via the magnetically
attached tracker true magnetic that
sounds bad yep
I would just super glue it to the
yeah or better glue after calibrating a
resting state of the users fingers
individual sensors communicate their
position to the game engine very cool
very cool velcro straps secure the glove
at your palm and the individual finger
controls hook onto the end of your
fingertips with motors that offer
tactile feedback see this creates a
problem for modding into a boxing glove
but I'll probably just ignore that part
and just having gloves on and not having
to wear or not having to hold the
controllers will be good enough plexus
is shipping the gloves with toolkits for
unity and unreal game engines developer
kits are 249 per pair
ouch shipping in August oh yeah that's
not cheap this is something I've wanted
for a long time believe it or not I
didn't know that I wanted it to be a
battle royale and in fact I probably
didn't want it to be a battle royale but
something that I have wanted for a long
time is much much greater scale
multiplayer experiences something that I
had sort of envisioned a number of years
ago what's that what's that gave her
close Savage No so Savage was let me let
me make sure this is even the right name
Savage game Savage battle for new Earth
was this it
I think this was it so did I ever tell
you about those lands I used to run at
UVic yeah with like the huge amounts of
computers across multiple computer labs
on multiple floors all those kind of
stuff we would play savage because this
game supported some crazy amount of
players I don't remember the exact
amount of players that it supported but
we could have doesn't say labs versus
labs going on oh the other one to a
hundred and twenty seven players on the
team are field players yeah okay I
actually didn't know this was an actual
thing this is exactly what I wanted yeah
so this is an old game but it's a very
good like land pack you've got a huge
amount of people for some reason you
want to get everyone into the game and
like it was always really fun because if
I remember correctly this was like
redstone like redstone was in this game
so I had redstone in my head I think it
was called redstone pre minecraft and
you'd have a whole Lab you'd have like
the the leader of that team or the
leader of that lab go like we need
redstone and then the whole lives just
like loot stowed you see everyone in the
game just run over to go get it it's so
much fun and you have to fight each
other and you like level up and you
spawn in these different things and it's
like this whole combat RTS mix like one
person in each team is playing an RTS
game right all the other players are
playing like the minions it's it's it's
old it's very old interest and it's it's
fun so imagine that with like a thousand
people yeah and so if anyone I was
really into Supreme Commander that's one
of the games that I was most into out of
any game like I think I was top 500 at
one point which it wasn't a huge
community but I was pretty good at it
imagine for a moment did you ever play
SAS up come I did a little bit okay so
it has large vehicles like I forget what
they were called but they were like tier
4 tier 4 vehicles that were like these
huge things where you could potentially
man something like that with like 20 or
30 people so imagine a 1000 player
version of something like savage with
just like kind of land
the way that sub comm had a lot of
really cheap swarmy type units yeah
so imagine a game like that with 500 B
500 with like all these different roles
so you could potentially run around as a
Marine or you could be like a gunner on
like this you know big land crawler tank
thing or being a heli with three dudes
house it was like local voice and you
like had to engage in local voice so if
you're in that mammoth tank with 20
people you've got like the the driver
like telling what's coming up got
telling people they're like reload
different sides all this kind of snow
actually have to use like your comms
system to talk to anyone that isn't
nearby like this sounds like a gaming
experience that would probably be too
hardcore for the fortnight kids I'd love
it though but I think it's the kind of
thing that could be a completely
different level of fun one thing I've
really really enjoyed and I know you
haven't played this game but it's called
it's called black wake and I was really
hoping this is what Microsoft's pirate
game was gonna be like but it wasn't
really but I don't even remember what
Microsoft our game is called at this
point but in black wake you drop into a
new game and you're on a you're on a
pirate ship you're sailing in the ocean
and you have to fight other people's
pirate ships but you're your captain
like it's you're in first-person view
and you really can't see all that much
if you're if you're the one doing things
on deck right and you have to like get
the Gunpowder and get the the cannonball
and you have to chub the Gunpowder in
the thing and shove the cannonball on
the thing and then load the cannon and
then you can aim it and fire it so like
you can't look where the boats going so
the captain has to sail the boat and
then like bark out like I'm lining up
for this side like port side port side
and everyone's trying to reload the
cannons on port side the captain that's
a yellow like there's there's a hole
below deck so nice to run below deck and
try to patch it and bail the water out
and all it is so planetside 2
free-to-play massively multiplayer
first-person shooter that has the
Guinness world record for the biggest
first-person shooter battle with eleven
hundred and fifty eight players being
recorded in a single battle
I don't but this doesn't have the RTS
elements yeah I don't personally think
it captures the same the same idea
but it is I've played a bit of
planetside 2 it is sort of like that but
I yeah I don't think it quite captures
the same idea right part of the reason
for me is I believe planetside 2 is a
persistent battle like forever zzzz it's
not a match right I think you can win
and lose areas oh yeah you can win and
lose areas and like there will be an
individual battle for an individual
place and if one person wins or loses
that it probably ends and whatnot but
it's not it's not the same type of type
of thing
all right let's see what else we've got
for topics here all right we didn't even
talk about Mavericks so Mavericks
promises right posted by crunchy dragon
on the forum original article from
pedestrian TV earlier this year
Automation games revealed Mavericks
cleaning its battle royale mode can
support for 400 players crazier yet some
game modes the studio says will
facilitate up to a thousand concurrent
players okay a persistent environment
means players will leave tracks wherever
they go and you'll be able to drop in
and out at any time the world will
continue to exist and evolve whether
you're there or not neat and it'll be
able to host up to a thousand players in
any given server Google's game streaming
service may have a hardware component
this was originally posted by master
disaster on the forum the original
article is from kotaku so basically Game
Developers Conference in March Google
representatives met with several big
game companies to gauge interest in its
streaming platform codenamed Yeti and
this is yet another indication that
whether you like it or not cloud gaming
is going to be a thing a lot of people
were so mad when I did that video on
what's in videos called again I know you
mean but yeah I don't shield something
what's what's it called no no it's not
called grid anymore
Nvidia it's not called game no cloud
gaming I can't remember what it's called
GeForce now yeah so a lot of people were
mad they were like they're gonna have to
pry my hardware from my cold dead
fingers and yeah and you might be right
but what's gonna happen is cloud gaming
is going to happen whether you like it
or not and
gonna be much like you know the Xbox has
gaming experiences that are simply not
available on the PC there's going to be
gaming experiences that are available on
cloud gaming that will not be available
to those of you with graphics cards and
your cold dead fingers
and graphics cards in PCs aren't also
not going away anytime soon just to be
very clear but I can imagine a scenario
where if every player was running off of
the same data center effectively you
could actually enable massively
multiplayer experiences more easily so
the latency instead of being between the
persistent environment and every
individual player because you'd have
effectively like zero latency within the
data center would be between every
player and their own connection to the
persistent world
I actually foresee a way to create
gaming experiences that otherwise
wouldn't be possible yeah that's why it
will exist and I hadn't actually thought
of that until I said it just now but
there's nothing you can do this is
happening and it also helps that massive
companies like Google are jumping into
the fray it's not just going to be
Nvidia playing by themselves with some
smaller startups yeah I don't
necessarily know if I like it or not but
I do think it's gonna happen it might be
I I feel like it would be cool if there
was like some games you know how like
wow has a subscription yeah memos have
subscriptions you're gonna pay for a
subscription anyways whatever if it's a
game that makes sense I have a
subscription for yeah whatever but I see
it coming to the point where it's like
downloading games instead of buying
physical copies where like people are
like oh yeah it's just easier so I'm
just gonna do it anyways and then it
bites people in the butt later when now
they have download caps and games are
100 gigs and other things start
happening out to mention that
multiplayer just goes away
once the game dev doesn't feel like it
anymore yeah like that kind of stuff so
Google took meetings at e3 in Los
Angeles a few weeks ago apparently the
company is looking not just to woo game
developers to the yetee service but to
buy development studios entirely oh
that's interesting old boy whispers have
been quieter around Google's hardware
whatever that might
like but the rumors suggest it will link
up with the streaming service in some
way it's not clear if they want to
compete with the technical specs of like
a new gen Playstation or Xbox or whether
it'll be cheaper and low-end relying on
the streaming server servers to pull
their weight down
Google is apparently been on a massive
hiring spree bring an experience video
game developers and marketers from EA
PlayStation and other top companies
interesting this was posted by friendly
non murdering sort on the forum thank
you for that this is super cool Android
messages for web now available for
everyone the original article is from
google.com you can use your computer to
chat with your friends through messages
for web which shows what's on your
messages mobile app it's about time
messages got some attention hey like you
didn't even have cloud sync until like
it just started working for me very
recently I was like oh holy crap my
messages are still there when I switch
phones how did this take so long and
just so you guys know to get it you're
know this isn't even the right link
messages for web sends SMS messages
using a connection from your computer to
your phone so carrier fees will apply
just like on the mobile app this is not
like I message okay it's not data based
still but once Wow I keep forgetting
what they're calling it once the new
check once chat rolls out I see no
reason why it wouldn't be able to use
data so if you go to messages Android
comm it will give you the super super
easy instructions on how to sync it you
just click on the triple thought thing
in messages it'll bring up a like a QR
code reader scan it you're done oh and
I've used it a fair amount already
because I've been coordinating a stag
and people that aren't on some other
messaging system to be able to write out
a massive message with my keyboard and
then just copy paste pop-up lot perfect
way easier you compare it on multiple
devices but only one will be active at a
time um Corsairs acquiring Elgato gaming
this was posted by QE kolka on the forum
I'm hoping that this situation is
amazing because I've had a super intense
frustration with them for a long time
which is where they only support Windows
10 on their devices right so you want
Corsair to go and invest heavier into
wider I doubt it but good luck what
about new devices though because of
course if they make like stream deck 2
or like some new capture card so my hope
is actually less to do with capture and
more to do with taking stream deck
technology and putting it into keyboards
so of course there's gaming keyboards
are already pretty cool but Elgato has
clearly done a lot of work on remember
the the art lepida of Optimus keyboard
from back in the day if you guys know
what that is look it up yeah it's pretty
cool individual display on every mm so
so I would love to see Corsair take that
technology and make it actually useful
and of course there's pretty good at mac
make the keys more durable so that if
you press on them they don't like ruin
the screen below it and stuff like that
stuff like that yeah I'd be really cool
even if they just did it as like a G key
area yep I wouldn't even I wouldn't get
your hopes up though I know I know I
want it so no sevens like it's done man
it's done that one but Windows 7 is what
I have to use for my sword for my
argument cuz that's where the majority
of users are but someone found I should
have been able to find this but I didn't
but someone found that there's the like
history log of versions and on one of
the versions the only thing stopping at
work from on Windows 7 8 and 8.1 is a
flag that checks if you have the right
operating system so someone made a
wrapper that just ignores that flag and
you can just install it on whatever
operating system you want and it works
completely fine it doesn't have like if
I remember correctly it doesn't have
like Twitter video integration or
something and I'm like wow I don't care
right so yeah I'm just gonna do that and
work on my computer's mind but last
topic of the day you'll probably be
excited or apprehensive this is off news
Xbox comm and it was posted by master
disaster on the forum which is actually
a great great user halo TV series set to
begin filming in 2019 is it live action
show time president and CEO David Nevins
has announced the network has ordered a
10 F
so it's season based on the Halo game
franchise Kyle killin awake will serve
as executive producer writer and
showrunner Rupert Wyatt Rise of the
Planet of the Apes will direct multiple
episodes and also executive produced the
hour-long series which enters production
in early 2019 okay so it is not clear to
me if it is live-action or animated it's
possible that some people know that I
think the a massive massive mistake was
making the Warcraft movie
live-action did you ever see it I based
on how terrible you told me it was I
didn't bother okay yeah but you played
Warcraft you saw these amazing
cinematics I played Warcraft like not to
yeah and not three they do not play two
and three I did play two in it yeah I
just mean I was just feeling kind of old
because you were like you played
Warcraft and I was like yes I I played
it too to be fair I played it many many
many years later just to see what it was
about it's not very good no it's
actually pretty alike kind of bad yeah
and the AI is like super super brutal so
bad but the cinematics in Warcraft I've
always been amazing yeah and yeah world
of warcraft cinematics same idea
absolutely amazing cinematics yeah and
then we get the movie and it's
live-action like they have in my opinion
possibly the best cinematics in gaming
there's some argument there with square
units yeah Square Enix has some really
amazing stuff too in my opinion it's
it's close or better but it's hard to
make that argument they're very you have
to go back very far and kind of compare
era by era because they've both done in
my opinion spins them they've both done
arguably a better job of cinematics than
games multiple points in their histories
yeah sometimes it's not even arguably
it's just like clearly that's way better
and so they're probably kind of depends
on which one going together the whole
time Blizzard has been incredible at
cinematics and then they make a
live-action movie and I just every
single time that I see a Warcraft or
Starcraft or what
ever that the overwatch cinematic from
Blizzard I'm like holy crap this is gold
everything about this is perfect and
then you see live action it's what are
you doing so I hope halos not like that
there's nothing here about whether it's
live action or rendered on the Xbox comm
article anyway maybe here people are
telling us in twitch chat yeah I haven't
seen any in twitch chat alright so
that's pretty much it Oh Mickey five
five five says I loved the movie and
that you are a hater well you probably
just don't know things about Warcraft
wow
and on that note thank you for tuning in
to the wine show we will see you again
next week same bat-time same bat-channel
[Laughter]
dang it's live action a whole bunch
people are saying it's like it's live
action alright and no I didn't find my
cat thank you for asking you are a
straight-up Saturday
someone else replied Warcraft made me
want to gouge my eyes out wow that's a
little aggressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
