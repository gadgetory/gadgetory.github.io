2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys we're here at the
ecs boost to check out their new machine
and domination line of memory of
motherboards sorry about that these are
87 chipset boards and holy cow if you
look at the domination ones that is
bling in their CPU socket is plated with
gold and it just looks pretty awesome if
you're one of those lucky few people
that got the limited edition swiftech
block that would go so well with that I
can't even begin to explain how well
that would go with that the red color
scheme is actually the same so these two
are z87 h3 ax models they both have an
external and internal Thunderbolt port
which is just pretty epic and not
entirely sure what you can use that
internal one for but you have that
option they both have six out of three
point 0 ports V checkpoints tons of fan
connectors they both support quad sli
with 16 x pci express slots they're just
beast beast motherboards all the on
onboard buttons you could possibly want
gold plated caps it looks like gold
plated caps they also have creative
sound core 3d which will help apparently
help isolate sound and threw in FPS
games and other stuff as well they've
got where was the other thing dual
killer gigabit lan ports apparently they
interviewed some gamers and decided that
gamers don't like it when they lag which
is I guess anyone could have told them
that but they interviewed some gamers
they support team complexity so they
probably interviewed them and they
decided that it might be a good idea to
throw killer networking on their boards
when we moved down to theirs at 87 h3a
to exports which are slightly chopped
down versions of the previous sports we
were just looking at you lose the duel
Thunderbolt you lose stuff like that but
there's still very very nice high-end
boards you still got six SATA 3 pointer
ports you still have V checkpoints you
still have all that kind of stuff you
still have dual gigabit killer land but
it's a little bit chops down like I just
said not quite all the options you had
before still tons of onboard buttons
they're still very high in boards and
they still have the same color scheme so
if you don't need an internal
Thunderbolt header and a few other
things that are on the
high on boards you can still get these
ones still get the color scheme still
get an awesome board and still be happy
we're going to move on in the ucs booth
if you want to see all of our computex
content be sure to keep watching and
we're going to move on alright guys
we're still here at the ecs booth they
have something very very cool going on
that I haven't seen anywhere else here
at computex they have a bill vlogging
competition if you guys know I run the
forum and i love the bill log section
that's why we have a bill logs hey
Awards every single week on our live
stream these things are insane they have
a huge competition they're giving away a
million new new Taiwanese dollars to
whoever wins this competition so we're
going to do a really really quick one
through of the top five that they have
brought here so what you're supposed to
do is go to WWE facebook.com slash ecs
and vote on which one you think is the
best I'm but I haven't had enough time
to actually see everything here so I'm
just going over some really general
stuff this thing looks absolutely nuts
you can see right angle graphics card
with an extension which is nuts its
water cooled you got dominators on there
this thing's insane he's got some custom
cabling going on he's got custom lights
going on he built the whole freaking
thing this top can drop down to actually
actually in my opinion look better but
right now he's trying to show off all
the hardware considering he's at ecs he
wants to show off vcx is hardware it
looks absolutely amazing down here
you've got some triggers you've got some
vandal switches a LCD panel this thing's
crazy just everything's going on and
it's just an absolute beast it's
apparently called the orthis so if we
can back up here and check out the next
one this one is very very different
compared to last one we're looking at
sounds very very minimalistic it looks
very very classy he sleeved his cables
to go along with the board I hope it's
it's wooden and this is a plexiglass it
seems and just very very nice not the
insane performance that we saw on the
one previously but it's just very very
clean cut it would be very very nice to
have this on your desk I'm not going to
pull this just in case i can break
something but i'm assuming that turns
off these two lights which is just so
classy this would be very very very cool
to have in your office if you are a
businessman and it seems to be tuned for
that style as it's a very small
motherboard and not the biggest graphics
card ever very nice built then we come
down here and we get to your industrial
design a very very heavy metal sharp
sharp sharp looks very very nice huge
radio
Peter's their massive massive reservoir
very cool we come around this side and
you see the water-cooled graphics cards
which are just absolutely awesome very
very nice leaving looks very very tight
not sure where he got that from but it
could be a million-dollar PC because of
how nice it looks it looks like it was
all done by him very very nice heat
shrink cuts the whole thing just looks
absolutely amazing like I said
industrial design we've got a nice LCD
panel up here where he can control
different fan speeds and pump speeds and
lighting which is just very very very
cool come down to another one this is
actually too but it's submitted by one
person again industrial design
aggressive looks like a tank not like
the classy one that we saw previously
but still looks like a tank you can see
he's got some custom painting going on
looks very military this one looks just
nuts there's lights going off everywhere
it looks very Gundam I'm not exactly
sure how he did this but that's a very
cool its form of exercise individual
people so I'm not entirely sure what's
going on unfortunately this one's not on
but it's very very very cool now we're
coming to our last one if I can back up
here but there's people in my way
hopefully I can get back okay this one
again comes more with the classy style
that we saw earlier very very clean it
looks really really good there's tons of
pain and going on i'm not entirely sure
what this made out of feels like metal
isn't metal aluminum is made out of
aluminium aluminium there we go very
very nice did you cut this all yourself
that's fantastic it looks really really
good I like the minimalistic styles for
bill dogs so the big aggressive ones
while they're very very cool not
necessarily my style I like the more
subtle ones like the one previously and
this one like I said previously you guys
can go on facebook com / ecs vote which
one you think is the best they will get
a ton of money so make sure you go and
support which case which modder case you
think is the best thanks for watching
and we're going to continue alright guys
just before we left the ecs booth I came
by the Thunderbolt demonstration so what
they've done here is they put five
Thunderbolt drives in here and hooked up
a thunderbolt monitor all these are
linking together you see all the crazy
cables hopefully if you're going to do
something like this you can get shorter
cables because that's just nuts and the
cable management enthusiast in me just
cries when he sees this although the
loops are quite nice I would like
shorter cables and tie down anyways it
goes out the back
here plugged into this machine and then
this machine is reporting and showing
how fast the transfer speeds are going
now I asked them which drive they're
actually reporting this from and they
did not tell me but it's I ohmmeter so
i'm assuming it's an overall that i'm
not sure if they're transferring data
are doing anything interesting like that
but this just goes to show what you can
actually do with Thunderbolt it's one
plug in and you're plugging all this
stuff in so say you're a business user
you have a business class notebook or
business got system that you're moving
around you can just come home plunk down
your laptop instantly have all this
insane amount of storage and a monitor
plugged in with no real problems also
with some people like Silverstone
hooking up new external graphics card
boxes where you can have a graphics card
in a box and have a plug-in with
Thunderbolt that's another thing you
could do with this and have them all
linked together you can have all your
storage your monitor and an external
graphics card all linked in through one
plug which is very very clean and I'm
very happy that they have this on
display thank you for checking out our
