enthusiast would have told you that you
were crazy if you said you wanted to put
top-of-the-line hardware especially
graphics cards in a tiny little box like
this one now
the GPU makers are practically begging
for it by designing little tiny flagship
class graphics cards so the only
question that remains then is this AMD
or Nvidia for your elite flagship class
small form-factor gaming PC
vote for turnip it's a shirt I don't
have one so we're gonna do our best to
demo what it looks like and this is not
what the real shirt looks like it looks
a little more like this but we didn't
have a sample to show you guys so this
had to do you can stay tuned after the
outro for bonus footage of the creation
of this masterpiece if you're into that
sort of thing now today's video will
focus on thermals form factors and the
compromises that we need to make when
deciding between the gtx 980ti
and the radeon r9 fury x but as you all
know there's actually more to the story
than just degrees Celsius and fps these
days with free sync and gsync technology
having a huge impact on the gaming
experience so drop the like under the
video if you'd like to see us put these
two Tech's head-to-head very soon to see
which one delivers the most responsive a
lag free gaming experience for now
though I'll introduce the test bench
inside a silverstone SD 13 case the same
one from this video where we put an 18
core cpu and a Titan X inside it will be
cramming not necessarily the highest end
hardware but rather what I would
consider to be a very reasonable yet
premium gaming PC so we've got a 4670
case EP you not overclocked 16 gigs of
Corsair Vengeance Ram the rather unique
sx 500 500 Watts s FX L power supply
from silverstone and the seuss Maximus 6
impact then we'll be testing that config
in two different ways for the first test
we've got a reference gtx 980ti
actually the same one we reviewed back
here so this isn't a water-cooled
graphics card which means we can use the
radiator mounting point in the front of
the case for our CPU in our case of
course our H ATI
then for our second configuration I
swapped out the video card which
actually was a surprisingly complicated
ordeal that involved removing the power
supply removing the graphics card
removing the CPU cooler removing the
motherboard to install an air cooler on
the CPUs as we no longer have room for
our CPU all in one liquid cooler and
reassembling everything to replace our
980 TI with the fury x
whose form-factor I wasn't really sure
about until well now that I've actually
used it I mean I still don't know how
much sense it makes for some cases but
in the st 13 anyway it feels like the
PCB space that AMD saved with their on
package HBM memory was exactly enough to
compensate for the extra space consumed
by the water cooling tubing sticking out
the back of the card and the radiator
that needs to be in the front of the
case now so let's run through which of
these setups performed better please
note that I consider this testing to be
pretty much a worst-case scenario for
all Hardware involved since the ambient
temperatures Ihara
significantly over 30 degrees Celsius in
here first up is CPU temps I used I 264
CPU tests to load up our 46 70 K and the
gtx 980ti rig thanks to its CPU liquid
cooling is the clear winner here with
the CPU topping out at a frosty 64
degrees by contrast our small
form-factor heat pipe cooler had the CPU
at a still not technically dangerous but
much less impressive 87 degrees Celsius
and that is without the GPU under load
next up as a result that I actually
didn't expect motherboard temperatures
aren't often overlooked yet super
important part of maintaining a stable
PC and while gaming our 980ti
configuration actually ran away with
this one but I also wouldn't read too
much into it because both are well
within safety margins and depending on
the position of the motherboards thermal
sensor sometimes just a hotter running
CPU can result in a much higher reading
for the motherboard
even if airflow around the socket from
the CPU heatsink is more than adequate
which leads us to idle noise impressions
none of the whining that i've heard
tales of online is present in either our
old dead fury acts or our new fury act
samples but since both configurations
were equipped with cheap pumps and I'm
not saying that to be mean to all in one
liquid coolers or anything it's just
that you're getting what you pay for
when you spend $100 on a d5 they both
had a little bit of you know pump no
but both were satisfactorily quiet in my
opinion but what about load while gaming
well the fury EXO 980ti configs were
actually not noticeably more or less
annoying to my ears then each other
they're both cooled by a great a fan on
their radiators in each configuration a
gentle typhoon or an n ff12 that handles
most of the airflow through the case and
neither card exhibited any bothersome
coil whine for more than the first
couple seconds of gameplay in Crysis 3
on the fury X but this my friends is
where things get really interesting
the 980ti did its usual cat that 83Â°
thing while the fury acts stayed at a
very cool 67 degrees nothing unexpected
here I mean it is water-cooled of course
I was going to win that but the
interesting thing here is that the fury
acts actually managed to score 5 percent
higher in our Crysis 3 benchmark at 2560
by 1440 with very high textures and
system spec with anti-aliasing it
disabled and motion blur disabled as
well what our 980ti and this is why I
specifically pointed out that it's the
well that was interesting we actually
have some new information now but in the
meantime I'm just going to get through
the rest of what I wrote there so are
980ti and this is why I specifically
pointed out that it's the same one we
reviewed turbos like an absolute beast
almost matching our tight necks and has
no problems beating the fury acts on an
open test bench but when you confine
both of them to a small form-factor case
the story changes somewhat more than we
knew which leads us to the conclusion I
came into this video thinking that the
fury axes shorter lengths and overkill
cooler was a solution to a problem we no
longer have thanks to awesome modern
case designs like this one that can keep
a long power-hungry graphics card cool
but while I still think an a IO liquid
coolers are kind of a kludge II
enthusiasts only need apply solution
with a ton of issues thanks to the fury
exa small form factor machines with this
card have the ability to focus their
cooling power on the one component that
makes the biggest difference to gaming
performance so thanks to that the fury X
is able to turbo to 10 50 mega Hertz
it's max while the 980ti is stuck at a
mere 1037 well within its spec I mean
it's not underperforming but not the
best it can do in a more ideal situation
and another consideration is that while
the fury X machine's air-cooled CPU
obviously ran much hotter than it would
have with a liquid cooler a typical
gamer is only very rarely going to put a
load on all four cores of a quad-core
chip while putting a full load on a
graphics card is basically a daily
occurrence another argument for focusing
your cooling on the GPU so I'm getting
the nod to AMD today in this edge case
the fury X actually comes out looking
like the winner but with an important
consideration if you guys install your
radiator with the fan as an intake
drawing air through the read you will
notice that your inside case
temperatures rise as much as twenty plus
two
meaning that if your CPU was on the
border once you start gaming no longer
will be so I would highly recommend
doing what we've done now off camera and
turning that fan around to blow out of
the case that way your CPU will not
overheat like you saw happen when the
screen turned off in the middle of this
video but that's the kind of show this
is guys the kind where anything can
happen do these things what on earth are
those they're either the world's most
magnificent dildos or they're
ah yes headphone stands but I had
actually said in a dedicated video about
these not that long ago that the thing I
don't like about them is that they sit
on the desk and therefore take up desk
space and I called on the community to
design a wall-mounted headphone stand
that could be either 3d printed or one
design would be sent to Silverstone to
actually manufacture the designer of
which would get a gold colored anodized
version of whatever their design was and
that contest is actually closed but the
reason that I'm bringing it up is that
all the designs all eight freaking
hundred of them I can't believe how many
of you submitted some pretty amazing
designs are up for voting for which ones
are going to be the top ten on my mini
factory comm so check out that link in
the video description and vote for your
favorite wall-mounted headphone stands
the final decision will ultimately be
down to me and Silverstone but the more
votes that something has the more
closely we will be looking at it so
check that out now thanks for watching
if the video sucked then you know what
to do but if it was awesome get
subscribed hit that like button or even
consider supporting us directly by using
our affiliate code to shop at Amazon
buying a cool t-shirt like this one or
through a direct monthly contribution in
the community forum now that you're done
doing all that stuff you're probably
wondering what to watch next so click
that little button in the top right
corner to check out the video where Luke
takes a 3d scanner and presumably scan
some 3d objects I don't know I haven't
watched it yet
oh is it oh oh what is that stink so bad
oh oh yeah
is there a chunky in there is I don't
think this is next at all oh I think you
have to mix this just like a stick
there's a lot of chunky there is look at
this blue house here we go
vote for turnip t-shirt something that
was not in your job description oh well
okay it's really drippy over space does
drip like crazy so like kind of tickles
there's the second turn up I'm really
surprised anyone volunteered I thought I
was gonna have to pick someone to do
this I did not know what I was getting
myself in hahaha at all I did the bottom
of the turn it was my idea is like that
there we go that's a bottom of the turn
what are you dry as the turnip if they
have a root system there's the root
start at the bottom it's white it's
white we don't have a white okay so
that's the that's the design there's
really nothing else to it are you
covering his entire I'm drawing the
shirt okay you want me to do the other
shoulder sure if do didn't the other
some other color you know I thought I
was comfortable in my skin
and with you guys this is some
next-level right here okay so I have
that side doing that what do you notice
over here there's open space
are we good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
