exceptions including the SteelSeries H
wireless Corsair Vengeance 2100 and
audio technica ath ag1 to name a few are
terrible truly they're so bad that
usually when a manufacturer it calls me
up and is like oMG Linus we have this
awesome new gaming headset you want to
review it I'm like yeah sure
send it over if you want me to whip it
out on camera and shake it around a
little bit until we're both feeling
tired and a little bit ashamed which is
basically what I told Kingston when they
asked me to review the HyperX cloud when
I dropped by their booth at PAX at least
put them on your head they pleaded in an
attempt to make me reconsider
I made some kind of half-hearted threat
about lawsuits and headlights from
sharing headphones I mean I was only
half joking because the worst PAX
attendees are about as well groomed as a
typical homeless person I'd be reading
Li put them on and I was stunned by how
much sound their clothes design was able
to block on the busy show floor and by
how amazingly comfortable and light they
felt on my head I said so and my
Kingston contact knew this moment of
weakness was his opportunity to attack
then with the precision and strength of
an adolescent giraffe who was a little
big for his age he followed up and said
the mics removable they've got great
sounding 53 millimeter drivers and
they're only a hundred bucks unable to
hold my own against his feverish
onslaught of product salesmanship I gave
in and said okay send me a pair and I'll
review them I've spent some time with
them and I gotta say they deserve more
than a review they deserved the stds
treatment welcome to episode number two
of stuff that doesn't suck featuring the
HyperX cloud gaming headset
d skills new Ripjaws for series is their
ultimate ddr4 memory with speeds of up
to three thousand three hundred and
thirty three megahertz available click
now to learn more it starts with the
unboxing experience I'm already
impressed at this point you get a padded
mesh carry bag a braided dual
three-and-a-half millimeter extension
with inline volume and mute controls an
additional dual three-and-a-half
millimeter extension just in case you
want to go make food while you listen to
music but you don't feel like investing
in a wireless headset an airplane
adapter a four pole three-and-a-half
millimeter adapter for mobile devices
and ultrabooks a detachable boom mic
alternate memory foam ear pads with the
lure covering in case you don't like the
genuine leather ones that come
pre-installed and finally the headset
itself which I'll start with by
repeating myself real leather
what a fantastic inclusion because you
know what
what did cows ever do for me anyway the
comfort of my ears is much more
important to me than cows and it gets
better you also get a sexy surprisingly
durable matte plastic construction
accented by this gorgeous
fingerprint-resistant brushed aluminum
finish on the ear cups and the size
adjustment mechanism that goes up into
the headband which features a tasteful
embroidered HyperX logo but linus lots
of gaming headsets look good and very
few of them sound like anything but a
muddled bass heavy mess what about these
ones not the case I mean yes they are a
little bit beats generation tuned that
is to say there is some extra emphasis
on the bass and mids are a bit
underpowered but unlike the track and
forge for example that I wanted so badly
to like because they looked and felt so
sexy the clouds managed to keep the
aforementioned bass punchy and tight
enough that it doesn't overwhelm
everything else throughout my testing
the clouds stayed fantastically
comfortable and delivered a great
listening experience in my usual mix of
top 40 and titanfall game streams that I
used to evaluate gaming headphones I was
absolutely blown away by how much I
enjoyed reviewing the HyperX clouds the
mic delivered a solid performance as
well so here's the mic test
I got him I got him great kid don't get
cocky thanks grandma
I'm sure Flopsy is feeling much better
now yeah the wife and kids are sleeping
finally time to game a bit so no it
isn't on par with the audio Technica's
that I reviewed earlier this year with
some noticeable tin eNOS to the sound
but frankly not much is and these only
cost a third as much but since they
don't have any weird you know wing style
headband design things going on and I
find them much more comfortable
I got a give again kudos to the clouds
now obviously Kingston doesn't actually
manufacture headphones in the same way
Corsair obviously doesn't manufacture
well anything so by this point I was
curious who with some of Kingston's
input presumably had actually built this
miracle product I didn't have to look
far the detachable mic cover says cue
pad on it and so does the box for that
matter interesting and not a bad thing
at all cue pad is very well regarded as
a maker of value centric headphones and
headsets looks like Kingston made a
great choice and great choice is pretty
much the video summary here they aren't
perfect I worried a little bit about the
long-term robustness of the internals of
the size adjust mechanism but especially
at the actually lower than $100 $80
price that they're on at Amazon for at
the time of filming they are an absolute
no-brainer go buy this headset if you
need a new gaming headset guys thanks
