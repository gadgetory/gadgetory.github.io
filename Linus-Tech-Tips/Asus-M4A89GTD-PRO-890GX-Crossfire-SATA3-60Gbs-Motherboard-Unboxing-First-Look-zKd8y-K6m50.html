unboxing and first look at the asou m4
a89 GTD pro motherboard the biggest
difference between this one and their
other 890 GX motherboard is that the
other one has slash USB 3 so the 890 GX
chipset is AMD's latest chipset for
their phenom 2 phantom 3 Phenom at 1/2
all of their different CPUs ok and what
it brings to the table more than
anything else is support for say 2 3 6
gigabit per second now right now SATA 3
and USB 3 are really hot features
everyone wants to have them but this
chipset doesn't have integrated support
for USB 3 so that means it's up to the
motherboard manufacturers to build that
in using a third-party chipset so that's
why this one does not include USB 3 but
it does include SATA 6 gigabits per
second support and you can see I think
they're actually using completely the
same box for these boards even I don't I
don't think they've made like they've
made a couple changes they've added a
bar for USB 3 here and then that's about
it
so anyway this is gonna be fairly
similar to the one we already did for
the pro slash USB 3 but why don't we
open this up and do a quick unboxing
here anyway so we've got an i/o shield
which includes their foamy padding at
the back then we've got a user's guide
which also has a little addendum about
the VGA switch card so that's this guy
right here when you have one graphics
card installed you should put the VGA
switch card into the other PCIe 16x slot
and that will allow the board to
function properly if you have two
graphics cards in crossfire mode then
it's fine to remove this and install
another graphics card just make sure you
don't lose it in case you ever want to
go back to single graphics in the future
next we've got the driver DVD don't use
this install the latest off asus calm
inside the user's guide you'll find the
usual stuff including a motherboard
overview some basics on how to plug
everything in and I mean a soos does a
pretty good job of their motherboard
manual so you should find everything you
need in there next we've got four SATA
cables include
they're cool I'm guessing these are SATA
yeah these are labeled SATA 6 gigabits
per second cables there's one straight
and one right angle and then for the
regular say two two cables you've got
one straight one right angle what I
suspect is that to say the two cables
would work just fine for say two three
anyway but there you go these ones look
cooler so yeah next we've got an IDE
cable and then we have their Q connector
so we have one USB and one for the front
power hard drive LED reset switch all
that good stuff then let's get the board
out itself it seems like most of our
viewers we're overwhelmingly in favor of
the camera man's view on on this this
chipset heatsink so they do not think it
looks like a tree or like a way for like
a green initiative sort of thing so I
stand corrected I suppose but let's have
a look at the overall layout of this
board this is an am-3 socket that means
you've got support for ddr3 in dual
channel configurations so up to 16
gigabytes I believe would be respect for
this particular board you've got a fair
amount of room around the socket you can
see that these mosfet and Northbridge
coolers don't actually go up all that
high so if you're using like a good
sized tower heatsink you don't have to
worry too much about there being any
clearance issues there now let's keep
moving our way around you've got this
uses proprietary ddr3 dimms slots so
that means that the one end here is not
actually a clip so you just slide the
RAM in that side put it down into the
other side and then clip it closed up
here we've got our buttons for the turbo
key too as well as the core on locker
now core on lockers a huge feature for a
Seuss's 890 G exports because the other
manufacturers at the time of filming
this video do not have support for core
unlocking and that's what a lot of
people are doing with the lower-end dual
core and triple core AMD processors is
they're actually able to turn off or
turn on the blocked course so any seuss
as best managed to get around
AMD's restriction and they have enabled
that feature on their 890 GX boards
turbo key to is kind of like what it
sounds like makes the board go faster
okay so memo okay is there technology to
make sure that no matter what kind of
round you're running in here if you
press this button it'll set it to
settings which will allow you to post
the board and configure it the way that
you want the 24 connector as well as the
8 pin connector are in their ideal
locations at the right-hand edge and the
top of the board this is a really weird
8 pin connector I've never seen one like
this before it's very tall that is all
alright so then let's move around here
is the chipset itself so that's where
our state of six gigabit per second
ports you can see they're labeled here
are running off of so we have one two
three four five six SATA 6 gigabits per
second ports here is your front panel
hookups then you've got an IDE port
right here here we have a ton of USB 2.0
connectivity so you could hook up like a
card reader for front USB ports and even
like like a fan controller like a em
cube T balancer or something and have
them all hooked up all at the same time
without any third party cards then we've
got our PCI and PCI Express slot layout
I really like this layout you've got two
PCIe 16x slots those are crossfire ready
then you've got a 1x slot as well as a
PCI slot that would be covered by dual
slot graphics so after you got your
crossfire cards and you have access to
one PCI Express 4x slot and one PCI slot
I think that's a good mix for a board
like this then let's move around to the
back where we have the rest of our
connectivity ok so we've got a ps2 port
that's for keyboard then we've got one
two three four USB 2.0 ports but then it
gets a little bit sketchy err so why
don't we do this first and then we'll
move over there so we have one optical
audio out HDMI DVI VGA then we have a
FireWire port Gigabit LAN and 7.1 audio
now here's where it gets a little bit
more confusing these two blue ports on
the USB 3 model are actually USB 3 ports
they are not labeled USB 3 ports and you
can see that the USB 3 chipset is
missing so those are USB 2 ports they
are not USB 3 even though they are
color-coded blue this is also a USB port
but it is a USB 2 / eSATA port that
means that both kinds of connectors will
actually fit in here and will operate
with this particular slot you've got 7.1
audio as well as Gigabit LAN
and thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the m48 9 GTD pro not USB 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
