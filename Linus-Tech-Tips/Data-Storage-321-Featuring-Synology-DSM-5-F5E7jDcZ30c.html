click now to learn more alright guys so
today I'm going to be talking a lot
about storage and backup and whatever
you talk about these topics you have to
talk about the three two ones of storage
what are the three two ones of storage
well have three copies of everything
that you deem very important have two
different formats for that data and have
at least one of those backups being
off-site that is essentially one working
copy one locally backed up or remotely
backed up copy and at least one off-site
copy not in your site as in quite a
distance between you and that copy this
is for very important data if you're
just a home user so stuff like tax
records or family photos or wedding
coders or anything that you deem
extremely important another thing to
note is that raid is not backup raids
got your back if you have Drive failure
and it provides fault tolerance for
those drives but it cannot protect you
from user error file system corruption
natural disasters and many more things
raid is awesome at keeping your system
stable and keeping uptime high but
backup is only actually a backup when it
is an additional copy of the data not
the working copy simply putting all of
your data onto an ass and using it from
there doesn't make it a backup that
makes it a working copy with fault
protection on the drives for home users
accomplishing a three to one setup isn't
actually that hard
you can backup your important files to
something like flash or optical disk
storage locally and then just have
Dropbox or something like Dropbox sync
your files off-site but for those
looking for a more elegant and scalable
solution there's definitely more options
in the NASS space now because I have
recently moved a lot of my backup data
from inside my tower to a Synology Nass
I'll be discovering a lot of really cool
stuff about it this video is going to
focus on Synology DSM software but we'd
love to hear what you guys have to say
about other solutions and what other
solutions you might want us to check out
like FreeNAS or something like that if
you're wondering what model of Nass you
should get in the Synology space you can
check out the Synology Nass selector it
can help you figure out things based on
you
account data size and a ton of other
metrics now before we go any deeper to
get the most out of this video it will
help to have a basic understanding of
what both raid and Nass me show these
tech quickie videos here to learn a
couple things about raid and hopefully
check out this video here to learn
things about NASA
although Linus doesn't have this video
done yet so hopefully it'll be ready by
the time you see this alright so now
that we've got all that taken care of
let's get started installing the drives
is going to be quite easy with a
QuickStart guide once they're in there
you can either go to find Dotson ology
comm to find your naps through the
browser and begin setup or you can go to
Synology download page and put your
model and download the Synology
assistant which is a desktop application
that will help you find your Nass and
will allow you to manage it through your
browser monitor its resources through
the desktop application and other cool
stuff
before we move on I'd like to show off
syn ologies raid calculator it's a super
useful tool they'll help you figure out
exactly how much usable storage and
other things you'll have when running
different drive raid and SHR
configurations you can find it by going
to the bottom of sin ologies page and
just clicking on raid calculator now I
know I know I made you all learn about
these different raid levels and now I'm
not going to be using them sorry I'm
going to be using Synology hybrid raid
or SHR I find it cool because it allows
you to have read like redundancy while
mixing and matching your drives of
different capacities once you have it
set up you can expand it as long as the
drives you're adding are equal to or
greater than the size of the smallest
drive in your rig so for example we
would be able to add anything that's 500
gigabytes are above because I have a 500
gigabyte Drive in my array unlike other
raddish technologies Synology realizes
that you might not want to stick with
Synology forever and be stuck in this
one raid configuration on this one
device so they allow you to recompile
your data on any PC running Linux that's
because this is not a proprietary
solution this is a solution based on a
Linux raid setup and they have a guide
for doing all this which is awesome
alright so once you're inside and you
found your nest you just got to select a
few simple options you can decide
whether or not you want to clean or
migrate your data and then you want to
decide whether or not you want to
download the latest DSM software which I
do recommend or if you want to manually
install it later on if you do want
specific patch for some reason so if
your admin account and name your server
next and then decide whether or not you
want to have Synology hybrid raid volume
installed if you're not going with
phonology hybrid raid do not select this
option if you are make sure you do once
that's all done and we log in the first
thing we're going to want to do is
create user groups and users because
using the admin account is not going to
be ideal this is very straightforward so
I'm not going to show the entire process
but I will show just the creation of an
employee user group and naming of the
description but from here on out it's
just selecting things like what apps and
folders they have read and write access
to now all we have left is to setup our
drive volume so honestly like with most
ontology software if you just read the
text below the options it's going to be
really straightforward and your biggest
question is going to be one disk fault
tolerance or two disk fault tolerance
these line up with raid 5 and 6 and if
you watched Linus's video on that you'll
know which one will work best for you
all right now to the fun stuff we're
gonna install some apps there's a wide
range of apps in the store including
everything from running your own small
website or business to audio and video
managers that are actually quite simple
but make your life a lot easier
installation and setup of these apps is
quick and easy and a lot of the core
apps like I just said the audio and
video manager and a few other things
have mobile components as well next up
is the mobile app pairings which seem
stable which is good but personally I
feel like their usability and UI could
use some work and the feature list seems
fairly limited just to show an example
of this I'm inside of a folder in my app
right now and I can select play all and
move it to shuffle from there but it
doesn't work for all songs unless you
have every single one of your songs
inside one individual folder you can
tell at the top I'm not selecting
anything funny you can only select by
genres or folders recently added
composers stuff like that not everything
and at the very top I have it selected
on library the only other options are
stuff like downloaded songs and
playlists not everything just to cap
things off here there's a few things
that I really appreciated over the time
of using this nasod I'd like to go over
in no particular order first off and my
personal favorite out of all of these is
the share links you can take any file
that you have and create a share link
for it you'll notice here that I'm
running a
local IP but if you make this Nass
publicly accessible and give it some
sort of domain or something like that
that can change very easily there's tons
of different options for sharing this
and different levels at which you can
share it so different permissions based
on like social networks or people that
have access to the NASA already or QR
codes and how long this link will
actually work for tons of different
options and a great feature to have on
an ass next up is cloud sync so with
cloud sync you can actually use it to
sync up with a few different cloud
solutions but in this example I'll be
using Dropbox after a simple
authentication process there's really
not much more to setup and this is a
great way to have off-site
synchronization and backup of your
different really important files last
but not least is Quick Connect Quick
Connect allows you to access your Nass
outside of your home network so far
everything that we've been able to do is
simply tied in with in our network if
you register a Midas Station account and
then select a Quick Connect ID that's
pretty much all you need to do to be
able to set up Quick Connect if you're
worried about Quick Connect and want to
do everything manually if you go to
external access you can see all the
manual things you have to do there and
then configure your router a little bit
and then you're good to go there are
guides on how to do this on serologies
website so it won't be too hard but it
will take a little bit of manual
intervention all right guys that's a
wrap I hope you guys liked this video be
