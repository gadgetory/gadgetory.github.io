between a Zeon and a core i5 or Core i7
processor is a xeon good for gaming they
have been asked and answered a thousand
times but the reason people keep asking
is that there's a lot of misinformation
in the answers that are floating around
out there so let's address it here once
and for all with the purchase of a
qualifying Intel processor SSD or nook
you could instantly win an Intel gaming
Jersey and be entered in the draw for

myth number one Zeon's and consumer CPUs
don't work with the same motherboards
they're not intercom pattle this used to
be true when Zeon's were actually made
for completely different sockets but
it's no longer the case nowadays it's up
to the motherboard manufacturer to
implement support and in many cases it's
possible to install a core i7 on a
workstation board or server board or a
xeon processor in a consumer board but
certain cpu features like overclocking
on a workstation board or ECC memory
support on a consumer-grade board may
not be validated myth number two Zeon's
are inherently better for 3d rendering
and consumer CPUs like core i7s are
inherently better for gaming while in
some cases this will be valid for
example this $2,500 12 core behemoth of
a Xeon will not handle gaming as well as
this 350 dollar quad core Core i7
because gaming favors fewer faster cores
compared to many slower ones however in
cases where a core i7 and a Xeon can be
found based on the same
microarchitecture with the same basic
specifications they should in theory
perform exactly the same but theories
are just theories right so I handed a
Xeon e3 1276 v3 and a core i7 4790 non K
over to Luke to find out if their
performance other than support for ECC
memory on the Xeon and a couple of
consumer-centric features on the core i7
is any different
and they're pretty much the same you'll
see that Xeon wins by kind of very small
amounts on average that's probably due
to a bidding process more than anything
there's a bit of overlap on the bidding
for i7 since eons but this could be a
fairly high binge Xeon and a fairly
average i7 that's that's kind of about
it fairly anticlimactic anyways back to
you - okay so then why does eons exist
at all well for starters they have ECC
memory support which reduces the chances
of a memory error occurring that can
harm data integrity or system stability
for mission critical systems that cannot
crash and along those lines like other
workstation and server grade components
they are indicated for 24/7 operation
but that's not all even though we can
find Zeon's with the same specs as core
series CPUs sometimes the xeon lineup
also contains many additional products
with specialized features that are not
available to consumers usually because
they simply don't need them so why
bother spending money on them for
starters along with that ECC memory
support some Xeon support massive
amounts of memory per CPU and larger on
chip data caches which will dramatically
affect performance in certain workloads
especially very repetitive ones there
are also many Zeon's available not only
with additional processing cores for
running lots of virtual machines on a
single box or for big performance boosts
and workstation or server workloads but
as you move up the product stack you'll
find ones that can have two four or even
more CPUs in a single machine for when a
single multi-core CPU still isn't enough
and then finally Zeon's being targeted
at specialized customers like data
centers who are less concerned with the
cost of a CPU and more concerned with
the higher cost of the rack space and
electricity being used to support it
over a long period of time they are
available in configurations that are
designed to deliver optimal performance
per watt and per unit volume compared to
consumer chips where the assumption is
most of the time they'll be the only CPU
in the room anyway so in conclusion
Zeon's
are different from core series
processors but
only if they are different for your
workload it's not about which one is the
best it's about the right tool for the
job so picking the wrong one won't make
your PC explode so that's good to know
but there's no need to pay a premium or
give up consumer friendly features like
overclocking to buy a Xeon if you're
just going to edit videos on your PC
from time to time however in cases where
you need something not available to
consumers it's also important to realize
that consumer-grade chips are just the
tip of the iceberg in terms of what's
available out there speaking of what's
available out there do I ever have
something awesome for you guys books
it's backwards from our friends at Chi
Rho power they just released their new
flagship portable battery bank at noon
today the energy Plus which features a
very high capacity of 12,000 milliamp
hours while still maintaining a thin and
actually surprisingly light form factor
I mean look at this thing
12,000 milliamp hours that's insane
it comes with an AC adapter for quick
recharging and is suitable for any
device that charges through USB like
your smartphone or tablet
here at Linus Media Group we use tarot
battery banks whenever we go on trips
and they certainly saved leak and Knicks
butts when both of their phones died on
the e3 show floor this is a product that
anyone with a high power consumption
smartphone should have and for the first
3,000 units sold
charile is offering the ridiculously low
price of $29 and 49 cents insane after
those 3,000 units are gone it will be
available at $39.99 which isn't half bad
either but whatever you might as well
save a couple bucks right anyway
international shipping is now available
that's the biggest complaint we've ever
had about these cheero deals that we've
offered you guys before well I really
want to buy but there's no international
shipping don't know it's available now
so just click through the link below in
the description on Amazon and I was
confused but don't worry too much about
it it also comes with a cool little
brown carrying bag AC adapter thank you
for watching guys like this video
liked it just like it if you disliked it
leave a comment letting me know what you
thought don't forget to check out the
support us link in the video description
you can buy a t-shirt give us a monthly
contribution or change your Amazon
bookmarks to one with our affiliate code
so we can smell kickback whenever you
buy portable battery banks or whatever
else it is that you're into thanks again
for watching and as always don't forget
