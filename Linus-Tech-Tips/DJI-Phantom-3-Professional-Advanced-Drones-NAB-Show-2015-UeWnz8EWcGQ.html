fair mountain last year with one of the
most sought-after being in the DJI
phantom 2 so let's see how the newly
announced phantom 3 compares Lynas Texas
coverage of NAB 2015 is powered by
Sennheiser Kingston SD cards and
lynda.com the new phantom 3 comes in two
flavors a professional and advanced
version starting with a professional DJ
has chosen to go with their own 4k
camera for this drone the lens on the
camera is a 20 millimeter prime with an
f-stop of 2.8 DJ I also mentioned me
that the lens on the phantom 3 is
rectilinear which essentially means it
will no longer have a fish I like
distortion in the image in video mode on
the camera the ISO ranges from 100 to
3200 and instills mode it's 100 to 1,600
the camera has the ability to shoot
single-shot stills burst mode in three
five and seven shots auto exposure
bracketing and time-lapse on the bottom
of the unit DJ has added what they are
calling vision positioning technology
this allows the phantom 3 to fly indoors
and low to the ground more accurately
this lowers the chance of the Phantom 3
crashing if say the controller ran out
of battery mid-flight by giving the
drone the ability to land itself with
the context of how high up it is both
versions of the phantom 3 are using a
new three axis gimbal that is perfectly
suited for the included camera the
phantom 3 will also now be utilizing
tGI's pilot mobile app which is the same
app used with their more professional
drone the inspire one flying the phantom
3 is still a relatively easy process
using the new dedicated controller which
also borrows from the inspire 1 design
with the new controller an operator
could use a phone or tablet to monitor
and control the drone from a distance of
up to 2 kilometers the phantom 3 is very
nimble and operation with the ability to
suddenly drop very quickly while landing
in the spot you want the advanced is
sporting a 1080p HD camera for those who
do not want to deal with the workflow of
4k footage DJI is entering the drone
market aggressively with the phantom 3
the professional version is priced at
12:59 and the advanced version is priced
at 999 which given the feature set is
fairly competitive to the current market
one interesting thing I found with the
release of the Phantom 3 is DJ eyes move
away from actively supporting GoPro
cameras there does not seem to be a
version of the Phantom 3 coming that
will have GoPro support that may change
in the future but for now
gie is pushing forward with the cameras
that they have chosen to include with
their drones thank you guys for watching
