healthiest pizzas that sounds terrible
too bad we just ate
we're not sure about it but developers
like you
Dana Nance arrived
okay belly dancing
good morning San Francisco what have you
following our dreams all the way of the
Convention Center
and not where my dreams are but I'll
come with a glosses batch so we're going
to the information desk
I can't believe a pencil
we need breakfast what you do I am
standing in a VR room what's shakin not
lucky why are we doing enough state says
no we're we're planning all the shooting
we're doing for today and we finished
the VR demo you broke their gun and I
did we should what you said I just
dropped this camera on the way out of
that VR demo moment of truth
hey it works I mean all right what are
we doing we just finished shooting all
of the a role for our videos this is my
trashcan I put my laptop on so I can
look at my scripts seating all right
what are we doing we're returning our
garbage can because that's what
responsible comes in the kitchen
responsible citizens don't take that
back
all right what do we do it we're behind
the curtain accident we got food yeah
are we Stan what I wait here
why are we here what are we doing hey we
got tokens from the spot gambling is bad
it's not gambling if you don't buy okay
Wow
give me that you might milk no token you
won nothing there my turn
gambling is bad but fun
i won
right so we're we're gonna take a car
but there's all these bikes
he's like a terrible idea so - thought
it'd be a good idea trend bikes even
though he doesn't ride a bike and has
never ridden in traffic alright so I
just found Linus after being a bit
confused what happened you know what's
funny about this we're only like six
blocks from the hotel all right so we
found a bridge yeah it's not the right
page topic Golden Gate Bridge but it's a
bridge progress and this is full of
terrible ideas well we made it to Pier
39 and now we have to walk our bikes
because he didn't look up where the
nearest bike share was and apparently
it's like a mile back plus one key chain
four five four three four $13 this
freaking guy left me going to buy two
keychains for $10 doesn't tell me even
once one doesn't contribute hey wait I
said I wanted one right there - there on
top of that they give you one for free
cuz I already bought two and it goes and
picks the same order picked out for my
daughter all right what's going on wise
so after getting lost getting lost again
thinking we were pulled over by the club
getting lost again and then finding out
there was no return stationed at the
place where we're trying to go we are
finally rid of the deviled eggs and we
require of Everidge a maneuver back to
our hotel what am i updating for
overdone walking we never found a
beverage and we're just going to go back
to the hotel because there are lots of
corner stores there yay adventure
and what
5:30 in the morning I don't know Mac 528
and we had a face airport here to pay
surge pricing to get here 1.2 X is 4:20
in the morning
okay now that actually makes sense
because there aren't that many people so
they have to incentivize having uber
drivers out at that time she
incentivizing people had taken
imperfecta this chicken teriyaki it was
disappointing
okay
Mack on the way home togar but I San
Francisco good riddance
don't be like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
