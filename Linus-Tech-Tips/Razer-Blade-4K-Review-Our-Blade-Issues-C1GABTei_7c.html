bought last year have been returned to
Razer for diagnosis or repair and still
more are suffering from ongoing issues
so today's video is about two things the
4k blade update that dropped this summer
and whether any of the issues that we've
encountered with past blades are present
on it speaking of issues Sennheiser can
solve them that is assuming your issues
are specifically to do with needing a
new pair of IMS there hd1 Wireless in
ears feature a sleek design great sound
performance and a ton of awesome
features check them out at the link
below
the main attraction of the new blade is
of course the upgrade from a 3200 by
1800 to a 4k display and it's a
significant improvement but maybe not
for the reasons you'd think more on that
later there are some other things I want
to get to first the last generation Core
i7 6700 HQ CPU has been replaced by the
faster core i7 7700 HQ and the blade v
5s dual channel no no wait what
oh sorry about that anyway like I was
saying blade v5s dual channel ddr3 133
gets bumped up to 2400 megahertz for
blade b6 but other than that not much
has changed as far as I can tell the
reviewers guide contains some in my
opinion fairly misleading fluff about a
lighter chassis brighter keyboard and
improved thermal design but when I
questioned Razer about this they
admitted the chassis itself was
unchanged the thermal solution change
was just an updated software fan curve
and this one's the kicker the brighter
keyboard bit was meant to be compared to
a notebook without chroma backlighting
excuse me now they've assured me since
then that this messaging was never used
on the actual product page and that
they're going to send updated reviewers
guides to me and everyone who received
one but frankly that still really sucks
unless everyone goes back and updates
their articles videos and streams that
misinformation is still going to be out
there this review from tech spot for
example quotes the weight of the 1080p
and 4k models from the reviewers guide
but while the new 4k model is lighter
than the old qhd+ model this small
difference seems to be because the
display assembly was changed possibly
without adjusting the hinge because I
can't open the notebook with one finger
anymore not because the chassis is
lighter to be clear I'm not knocking
techspot here for basic non-debatable
product characteristics like color
weight and dimensions I generally take
the manufacturers word for it - and I
only double-checked this time because of
the other peculiarities maybe marketing
and PR isn't entirely to blame here
though maybe they wouldn't have to
scrape the bottom of the barrel to find
stuff to say about their latest engrain
if it was a bit more greatest and a
little less latest so and this is an
honest question what has the blade team
been doing for the last couple of years
what we did was that we got the best
thermal engineers the same ones that
worked on the razor blade and have them
look at the the new razor phone but I do
have some good news it's only been a few
weeks and it's a sample size of one but
I haven't experienced any of the issues
from our previous blades on this unit
even the weird color rendering issue
that John found in Google Chrome appears
to have been resolved and as much of
this video as I've spent criticizing it
so far the small iterative improvements
to the blade have added up to a
genuinely better product especially for
the user like me who wants a portable
machine that can game but that generally
uses it as more of a mobile workstation
battery life is much better thanks to
definitely Intel and probably Nvidia
fine-tuning their manufacturing
processes Mac system surface
temperatures are basically unchanged but
the cool spot for WASD is bigger which
is nice performance in games actually
improves a little bit b6 is GPU clocks
higher and runs a few degrees cooler
than v5 and the new touchscreen display
really is a lot better now at this size
4k resolution is irrelevant in fact I
actually wish that it was 1440p at the
max because both of these panels are
impossible to drive with the GTX 1060 in
modern triple-a games but for general
use its brighter the air gap is smaller
improving off-axis clarity and both
color and contrast are so much better
that last gen looks straight-up washed
out when placed side by side with the b6
this is
equal parts criticism and praise though
the difference here wouldn't be so
striking if v5 wasn't using such an
outdated panel so then it's better than
ever before
I still love a lot about it the keyboard
is among my favorite thank God that
horrendous one from the blade Pro didn't
make another appearance Thunderbolt 3
for external adding card support is
great and it looks and feels so
deliciously premium but its 2017 and for
gamers out there who want power and
portability the blade isn't the only
game in town anymore so in no particular
order here's what I want the blade team
to work on for the next 6 to 24 months
to make b7 and b8 go from aging to
awesome one the webcam it's still decent
but it's no longer ahead of the pack and
streaming is at the heart of razors
other product development - oh wow that
bezel a 15 inch screen would be perfect
here number three while I'm wishing for
a custom display it really should be
1440p and it should refresh at 120 Hertz
for a two-year standard warranty this
unit is great so far but razor you guys
really need to start standing behind
your products better to rebuild my trust
and 5 I don't know Dolby Atmos
certification that last ones not a huge
deal actually and I mean that's all I
could think of to change so obviously I
still love the razor blade which is why
it hurts so much when it cut me last
year and why I hate to see it getting
rusty and neglected like this speaking
of neglected thanks to man Outfitters
for sponsoring this video and warming me
up right now with this fantastic sweater
they're an online specialty retailer for
premium men's apparel and accessories
they have some of the best products from
the coolest brands and bring you a
painless shopping experience they have
over 50 brands like Patagonia Columbia
