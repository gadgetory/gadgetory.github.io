every time they move I have moved them
so I'm running the last movers coming
originally gonna follow the desert
garbage goes in my trailer
dr. Bobby John with garbage in my
trailer
what's that this is a prize PC that has
like a 980ti and a 59 60 X from Super
Micro we're doing a giveaway in the next
little bit it's about their new gaming
x99 board in it that they want to show
off apparently by having us give one
away so that's gonna be pretty sick as
well doing a new computer guys your
computer's already asking it as that for
editing anyway to smell your panties
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution - lets you get organized save
time and get paid faster check out the
link in the video description to try it
now for free uh if the server's break I
would like it to be because of me so
that I have no one to blame but myself
no it has nothing to do with not
trusting Dennis I just would really like
to be the one who carries the servers
that one is worth maybe 14 15 grand this
one's on the same kind of order of a
price so yeah we're just gonna yeah
we're gonna this one's extraordinary
heavy I wish I did uh you want to do
that with me yeah let's let's teamwork
this gonna be on my little bit worse by
yourself I have carried this one by
myself that's dumb
yeah it's really heavy it's not what is
it 20-7 hard drives in it so I can still
put another seventeen and win a 45
you're probably will I let's put on top
of that one karen says own you guys can
make another code no then really he's
still the one we'll just to be made fun
out of again
where's then we make it easier to see
where it goes
keep this on even know where the central
spot is okay water is also Cheers Oh
h2o my goodness I need some while I
don't have a mouse at the moment someone
pass me a Maps have to come there's
there are mice on page ah
lots of math yeah if you take them - for
yelling yeah yeah
he will yell at you and that is what
keeps me afraid and working for him
because I'm like an abused dog ok we
need to upload some videos but there on
the server don't service sitting on the
ground ok we don't have an internet and
we can't do it so sorry folks you're not
getting your video today the server's
here we have no internet and I don't
know where the rails for the case are
how are you doing it all I'm gonna try
and find the rails first I have
literally never rail-mounted
a server before I guess it's never come
up so I'll be wearing it now hopefully I
won't need instruction because I haven't
look at them leave all this behind the
scenes people must think it's a miracle
we get any video of me I certainly do
well people got that impression during
the whole full room lot of going right
which is entirely your fault I think
more like entirely my brilliant idea to
be a better mother than that I'm pretty
sure it says on the red follow me on
Twitter at Edgeley agri-food so okay
that
we might be straight bone right now hmm
okay that is progress there and then how
this attaches anywhere useful is not
good clear let's go okay okay so how the
hell it fell outward so that's how that
works
there we go
whoo we're good I get it this isn't hard
at all there's even a little notch for
the for the side rail piece this is way
better than just attaching them in the
front like wait hey Taryn we've
officially renamed you your job title is
now official post production princess
this turns the biggest diva who
complains about everything in regards to
the production temperatures are holding
steady Linus I can't I can't act no you
can just cut it before that so I
actually can't get into the server room
right now because all of our data
connections are being terminated at the
moment and that's kind of the most
important thing that we have going on at
the moment I don't want to screw that up
any more than I have to so and now that
I know how they work it should be pretty
quick to just bang bang bang through
those servers onto the rack this burrito
thingy is kind of messy it's called a
donor Taryn I don't know what the
difference is so this may be the single
most poorly designed CPU heatsink mount
of all time this is the antec cooler box
it has Philips head screws on the top
with literally absolutely no way to get
at them sometimes these things are
pretty hard to get at with a wrench top
here just unbelievable so I'm pulling
this off never to be used again
I intend to throw it in the garbage
maybe I'll put it in the garage sale for
someone who for free one dollar one
dollar
actually sure why don't I put the brush
now with all the heatsink it's kind of a
ring to it
$1.00 heatsink you've fattened yourself
plenty enough on these popcorn thingies
Brendan just take them
Tarin I don't care that's what he says
but he's been eating these all day what
little things he can read I think I can
read it I think I know I can read you
think you know you I know I know
come on Harun do you have an explanation
for this
it might I mean I might have been going
through the working cables bin and it
might have fallen out I just recognize
that from the working cables bin you
know like a fire wire a delayed I'm not
listening to either of y'all anymore
it's Dennis's nipple look I have yogurts
in my hand I have camera in my hand Nala
Han I'm trying to stop recording but so
it's just kind of like I have to shoot
it so I had no choice
do I think they'll finish that well they
have to they have booked an inspector
well we just found out that there is no
wire in there no keeping it ah very bad
how many are missing I actually haven't
counted them I came upstairs to do that
but based on this one into every one of
the offices four five six seven seven
missing missing hmm so we'll see we're
supposed to have an electrical permit
today or tomorrow so we're obviously not
going to pass if that's the case so I
don't know how that's going to affect
our move-in date which is really bad
because we're getting kicked out
tomorrow oh it is okay thank goodness so
just in the nick of time
our redundant our mini redundant power
supplies from FSP arrived so these will
be going into the servers instead of the
desktop power supplies that we had in
them before yeah I think so what
happened well we thought the rails
weren't gonna fit uh turns out it's just
really really tight this usually
probably walked it back over your place
grabbin resonating the popcorn all day
all day so this is fiber as you can see
it's pretty straightforward to install
actually this clips into there
done super nice that's quite clearly not
whoa it's probably fine
okay so there should be some like
fiber crap or something's up in a
package in there noise sounds great no
they must have left it in the other one
so no it must be on the other one he
told me it was in the other one but I
thought maybe just maybe they left it
here no he's not picking up
yeah there's one not working there's one
not plugged in yeah so what did we take
here let's put it back oh it goes like
this
oh nevermind so these ones just don't go
in as far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
