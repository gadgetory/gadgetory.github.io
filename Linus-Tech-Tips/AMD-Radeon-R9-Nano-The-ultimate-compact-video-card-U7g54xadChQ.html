more and more powerful we're seeing many
builders ditching the bulky full and mid
tower cases with multi-gpu setups in
favor of smaller systems that still pack
a powerful punch but with most top two
your graphics cards having sometimes
ludicrous space requirements and
generating lots and lots of heat fitting
them into something like an ITX chassis
can be a challenge with that in mind AMD
delivered upon this world the Radeon r9
nano a small form-factor graphics card
that promises performance on par with
full-sized flagship Radeon cards but can
team red deliver and give us a truly
first-class gaming experience in such a
tiny little package stay tuned to find
out and like this video if you want us
to do more theoretical graphics card
comparison videos in the future very
vague I know
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more despite the
official name of just radeon r9 nano the
nano is part of the r9 fury series of
graphics cards from AMD which also
includes the r9 fury the top-end
water-cooled the r9 fury x and despite
the nano being much smaller and less
bulky than the fury x it shows the same
GPU with 4096 stream processors and 64
compute units the only difference being
that the nano has a peak clock speed out
of the box of 1,000 megahertz
which is 50 less than the fury x the
nano also has the same memory
configuration as the fury x with 4
gigabytes of high bandwidth memory aka
HBM running at 500 megahertz on a 512
gigabyte per second memory bus however
where the nano sets itself apart is its
cooling and power delivery systems
unlike some other reference design cards
from AMD we've seen the nano has its
heatsink fins oriented horizontally
along the card instead of radially out
of the card you'd see a radial design
setup very often on Intel stock CPU
coolers and they did this they moved to
horizontal to minimize obstructions and
make the cooler function more similarly
to a blower style solution AMD is
targeting a temperature of 75 degrees
Celsius while gaming with this card
throttling at 85 degrees Celsius the
nano is also a lot less power-hungry
beak peak board power is rated at 175
watts compared to the 275 watt draw of
the fury and fury x the improved cooling
a reduced power consumption combined
with the space-saving benefits of HBM
which is physically integrated into the
GPU package means that AMD was able to
make the nano PCB only 6 inches along so
the card only extends as far as the end
of your PCI Express slot on your
motherboard do keep in mind though if
you're interested in dropping the nano
into your ultra small system that the
power connector alone 8 pin PCIe input
is oriented on the side of the card not
on the top meaning you'll have to factor
in some extra length there
for your plug coming off of your power
supply with that said let's have a
closer look at the card itself starting
on the front you'd see a matte black
metal shroud that looks quite similar to
what we saw on the fury X except of
course that the Nano is an air-cooled
card so there's a single 90 millimeter
fan on the front to cool everything down
do you note that if you pick up a
reference nano the heatsink and fan are
actually integrated into the shroud and
therefore are not easily removable
should you be interested in modding the
card the heatsink itself features the
after mentioned horizontal fins and no
heat pipes which AMD decided to omit to
keep the weight and bulkiness of the
card to a minimum while still keeping
the cooling good the back of the PCB is
bare though it does have a matte black
finish for a clean look moving on to the
top we see a fairly understated design
with the Radeon logo and only a small
part of the heatsink peeking through the
black shroud and then the side of the
card is open to allow case fans to help
move air across the heatsink and also
includes that lone eight pin PCIe power
connector we mentioned earlier on the
back we see one HDMI in three display
outputs note that this doesn't have any
DVI outs and we didn't see any adapters
in the box so make sure you pick one up
if you'll be using DVI with this card
now on to performance we used a fairly
standard test suite of Tomb Raider
Crysis 3 far cry 4 and The Witcher 3 for
our standard performance benchmarks then
we just added on firestrike ultra which
was a little aggressive but interesting
regardless then we did our standard
skybox testing in Crysis 3 to test heavy
low-temperature and system wattage from
the wall one very important factor to
remember when looking at these numbers
is the size of the nano yeah sure it's
trading blows of the GTX 980 and it's
being beaten by the fury both of which
are cheaper but this thing is absolutely
tiny in terms of size while the 980 and
fury are both center of attention case
monsters this shows in power draw as
well the only card that beats the nano
in terms of power draw that we tested is
the now old 285 compact from sapphire
which to be fair is in a much lower tier
performance which shows very well when
looking at the graph comparison of
system wattage per frame even though the
nano has a little bit more power draw
than the two
eight-five compact its system watch for
frame is under half which is pretty
great this leaves us with a card that
when compared to a 390x Strix Edition
performs better runs cooler and draw
significantly less power from the wall
all while being much smaller but at an
increased price of $200 which brings us
to our last question price yes okay you
got me it's not exactly a cheap card at
$650 it's got a price tag to it it's
dollars per frame is not really that
grace or price per performance is not
really that great but I honestly don't
think that's the reason why someone
would be interested in this card the
card isn't trying to be the best price
per performance card on the market it's
trying to be a badass in terms of power
consumption and performance while
containing itself in a small package and
that honestly basically was my
conclusion the Nano is small the Nano is
fast and the Nano draws an impressively
low amount of wattage from the wall it
does all of this while yes being a
little expensive but not to an
impossible degree and I could see a lot
of small form-factor builders looking in
this direction soon especially with the
number of case manufacturers coming out
with smaller and smaller cases every
year with some very interesting ones on
the horizon with the Braintree V dot
zero SDK which is one small snippet of
code you're all set up in less than 10
minutes they even have support staff
ready to walk you through the process
over the phone if you need them their
code supports Android iOS and JavaScript
clients and they have SDKs in seven
programming languages they make it easy
to offer multiple mobile payment types
including PayPal Apple pay
Bitcoin venmo cards and more all with a
single integration they have quick
knowledgeable developer support if you
have any questions and if you want to
learn more and get your first $50,000 in
