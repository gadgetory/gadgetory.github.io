Big Bang mPower this is a z77
motherboard that changes the game of
overclocking and I'm actually sort of on
board with what they're doing here so
has a three-year warranty it's got all
the usual z77 features including support
for the latest Intel Core i3 i5 and i7
processors on LGA 1155 Windows 700 and
Windows eight compatible there's that
new logo right there
AMD crossfire nvidia sli or supported
virtue MVP is also supported which means
you've got things like their virtual
vsync as well as performance boost I
haven't had that much experience with it
being compatible with a wide variety of
different titles but hey if you find a
doubt that it works for the games that
you play then great and hence components
you got their driver MOSFETs you've got
their OC PCB that's an interesting thing
to call it solid caps Superferry chokes
hi-c caps great so this is all their
usual military class 3 stuff hybrid
digital power interesting enhanced PWM
design with hybrid digital power
designed for overclocking on case Q CPU
so yes overclockable CPUs 8 pin power
for the CPU width at 6 p.m. on jewellery
power for video cards these are useful
and I prefer a 6 pin to a molex just
because these days I hardly have any
molexes in my system and it's hard to
like write one up there and hence
thermals ok Twin Frozr for base design
interesting total fan control with all 4
pin PWM fan connectors on board you can
customise them in the BIOS or in Windows
monitor and record all the fan speeds UV
checkpoints so you can actually use a
multimeter to check your voltages
because software based ones are not
useful Multi BIOS - this has saved my
bacon at least once before easy buttons
onboard power and reset clear CMOS
button on the back end a debug led
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are included as well
as SATA 3 6 kV per second you know what
all this information is stuff that we
could see by just opening up the board
so I'm sort of done with people design
of the blocks for now here's an
overclocking guide very cool to know
something like that and included neat
stuff ok next we've got the i/o shield
for say 2 3 6 gigabit per second cables
or what doesn't really make a difference
antenna for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
presumably okay all right you got a
flexible black SLI bridge my very
favorite kind and connectors to make
those front panel connectors a little
bit easier to do driver's disk quick
installation guide certificate of
quality and stability now actually I'm
gonna set this aside and we are going to
talk about it more later
software an application to use this
guide motherboard users guide and V
checkpoint cables so that you can
actually plug something into them
alright motherboard itself I haven't
even gotten into what's good about this
board yet you guys this is a very very
exciting board for one particularly
important reason and that is the
gorgeous matte black piece you know
that's not actually it so the matte
black PCB is good but let's go let's
talk about what makes this board special
so this certificate of quality and
stability we've seen this with products
before
however MSI has really stepped up their
game with the empower being OC certified
that's the terminology they're using
here OC certified performance power and
PWM cooling
however they really take it to the next
level check this out military class
burnin test every single board that
means this board the board you buy the
board your friend buys has gone through
strict tests to guarantee a stable
overclocking results so they actually
take every board they install a CPU
liquid cooler which means the PWM is not
getting any particular incidental
airflow from their test bench they
overclock a case series CPU to 4.6
gigahertz or more depending on the CPU
not every test platform is exactly the
same so a real overclock like not you
know an OC Genie overclock like a real
overclock then they put it in an
unrealistically high temperature
environment and they run prime95 to beat
the snot out of the CPU at that
overclocked setting for 24 hours plus
crazy right every single board is
overclocking validated with an
overclocked CPU the odds of getting a
dud and power board is basically nil
because
every single board is hand tested that
doesn't happen on regular motherboards
very very cool stuff really stepping up
their game right now these end the side
guys all right so let's cover the layout
there's your LGA 1155 socket lots of
room around it for big coolers 8 pin CPU
connectors and it's ideal location at
the top left you got your four
ddr3 slots supporting dual channel
memory you've also got your onboard
power connectors this is my new favorite
spot for them there's your OC Genie or
reset in your power because once you've
got a bunch of cards installed it's kind
of hard to reach the ones that are down
here or around here 24 pin power
connector and it's ideal location
there's the auxilary 6 pin for your
graphics cards as well as your v
checkpoints for checking the voltages
there's your post debug LED and again
this is my new favorite location for
this the on-board USB 3 header is at a
right angle on the right-hand edge of
the board perfect say 2 3 6 gigabit per
second 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
ports there's your multi bio switch to
switch between the two physical BIOS
chips got a couple of front USB 2 ports
a couple headers normal ones and you've
also got a high powered one for charging
things like an iPad ok you've got a ha
due to bandwidth allocation limitations
strongly recommended ok so you want to
use an Ivy Bridge processor if you're
going to use this bottom slot otherwise
these ones will run at PCIe 2 8 X 8 X
with a sandy bridge or PCIe 3 8 X 8 X
with an Ivy Bridge chip you've got this
is a fully PCIe board so you've got four
PCI you want X slots and then three PCIe
16x slots however physically they're 16
or 8 8 4 and this 4 runs off the chipset
so it's not as good of a force so
basically this is a dual card board
moving right along to this is actually I
think this is the best matte black PCB
I've yet seen so let's give me the
thumbs up because it's so clean like you
can hardly even see the traces it just
looks like if I change the angle a
little bit you can see the traces
sometimes probably but then other times
you can it's like very stealthy looking
let's have a look at the twin froze or
for inspired cooler so it's got a very
neat shape to it that actually gives it
a lot of surface area even really you
can't see a lot of it and it's using a
nice thick heat pipe
I think MSI is branding for this used to
be super pipe but I haven't seen them
really used that lately
checking out these LEDs so you can see
how many of your 12 flowerpower phases
are active on the CPU at any given time
so when you're doing something intensive
those are going to crank up to the top
and when you're not they're going to
stay right down near the bottom it just
kind of needs stuff because when you're
not consuming a lot of power fewer power
phases being active is actually more
efficient so there you go you learned
something today unless you already knew
that in which case you didn't learn
something today all right let's have a
look at the back i/o you got your ps2
port I still like to see that two USB
2.0 ports six USB 3.0 port two Bluetooth
your Wi-Fi Gigabit Ethernet is built-in
display port an HDMI handle your or your
video out remember guys you can use the
onboard video here for your video
transcoding functionality and you can
use your dedicated graphics card for
gaming you've got optical audio out as
well as 7.1 audio out so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the z77
mPower from msi and i think this looks
like my phone and don't forget to
subscribe to honest tech tips from our
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and don't forget the most
important thing about this board hand
texting you want a board that works 100%
okay I can't say 100% but 99.99% it will
work if you buy one because it's hand
tested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
