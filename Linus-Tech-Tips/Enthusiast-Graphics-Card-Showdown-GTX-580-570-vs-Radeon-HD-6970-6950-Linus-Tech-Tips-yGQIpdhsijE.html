review for the GTX 570 which I never did
one for as well as AMD's new radio on
6900 series graphics card so that's the
69 70 which I have on my test bench
right now I'm running Battlefield Bad
Company 2 for my my sort of pre
premeditated run-through that I do on
all of the cards to get you guys some
fraps recorded results so I have the 69
70 I have the 69 50 here I've also got
on the g4 side the green side the GTX
570 as well as the GTX 580 and then I've
included in my graphs the 68 70 as well
as a hawk Edition GTX 460 so that should
give you guys some some sort of a
measuring stick against a performance
series card so like a 460 or 68 70
versus one of these enthusiast grade
cards including the 6900 series as well
as the gtx 500 series so the games that
i'm going to be showing today are metro
2033 Battlefield Bad Company 2 3d mark
11 which is not a game technically as
well as the heaven benchmark and I will
be running all of them at 1080p
oh yeah Crysis 2 and running at fairly
high detail settings that means I have
enabled anti-aliasing in all tests and
the idea was to really stress these
cards so at the settings I was running
in Metro 2033 actually both the 60 and
70 and the GTX 460 are were what I
consider to fail like it was 14 frames
per second I could measure frames per
second but it was just too choppy
completely unplayable so anyway stay
tuned for boring charts and graphs and
other things coming soon so other than
straight performance let's talk a bit of
a feature comparison between the green
team and the red team for this
particular generation of products so
there's a few different things that are
similar first of all these are both
DirectX 11 graph
cards with beefy tessellation
performance support for all the latest
standards and all of that noise and
hoo-hah okay so they are both feature
complete now we have had times in the
past when one company actually has a
more advanced product than the other
for example AMD was ahead of Nvidia for
DirectX 11 and in video was way ahead of
AMD for DirectX 10 but we're not in a
situation like that right now so the
feature differences that we actually run
into are some different things so first
of all AMD has their Eyefinity
technology you can see they have a good
number of outputs on the back of their
card to DVI to mini DisplayPort one mini
rather one HDMI and that is what enables
AMD as well as some special
configuration the card to run up to four
displays off of a single card with
Eyefinity so that means you could do
three displays with your processor in
the middle middle peripheral vision and
then you could have like your your chat
on another screen above it or whatever
you want to do or you can even run just
three displays off one card for triple
HD resolution off of one card now to
counter that NVIDIA has their Nvidia
surround which isn't quite there
compared to infinity because you do need
two cards so if you run SLI on any
supported GPU which includes anything
back to as far as I know the GTX 275 ESO
has a couple other features including
their 3d vision okay so I have the
glasses up here and this is actually a
3d vision ready monitor so you can play
in stereoscopic 3d mind you AMD also has
they're competing HD 3d now so while you
have to bear in mind that both of these
approaches are slightly different with
Nvidia you're bound to certain
standardized components including the
glasses and the displays the AMD
approach is a little bit different in
that you are not bound to a standard
there are a bunch of different ways to
go about it but not all of them are
created equal
finally last but not least we have CUDA
and physics on the nvidia side as well
as full support for direct compute
on the AMD side so these are both a
couple of competing standards and it
really remains to be seen which one is
going to emerge as victorious so you
kind of have to take a road and walk
down it at this point and hope you made
the right choice so that is my feature
summary they both oh yeah of course they
both support SLI crossfire multi-gpu
configurations well they don't support
both support SLI this one supports SLI
and they don't both support crossfire
only this one does but they both support
2a and 3a GPU configurations except on
their performance grade cards so that is
on the enthusiast grade card support up
to three-way but you can see both of the
performance grade cards I have here that
is the GTX 460 as well as the Radeon
6870 only have a single multi-gpu
connector each so those ones only
support two-way multi-gpu configurations
graphs to come crazy Russian also
brought to my attention that the Radeon
6000 series also supports adaptive
anti-aliasing and I missed one feature
that they both have and that is support
for HDMI 1.4 a which enables you to play
back 3d blu-ray with supported software
and display
you
so in conclusion I'm not really going to
declare there to be a winner because I
think it's a bit of a mistake for
graphics card reviews because what
happens is these guys are both so
competitive AMD and NVIDIA that as soon
as the market condition changes they'll
both be adjusting their strategies and
their pricing structures in order to
compete better with each other so all
you really need to do is look at the
performance and I do recommend checking
out written reviews in addition to any
video reviews you might see because
quite frankly a lot of the written
reviews have a lot more time spent on
crunching the numbers and getting into
the nitty-gritty of the technology so
check out for example the review on
hardware canucks that is WWE Hardware
comics calm the GPU review guy over
there is a total guru so please do check
them out and so yeah I'm not going to
declare a winner because what you really
have to do is whether you're watching
this video right now we're watching it
six months down the road you can look at
these cards and compare them in terms of
their performance but you also have to
bear in mind the price so you'll have to
just see what are the prices at that
time and how do they stack up against
each other when you factor in the bang
for the buck aspect of the equation so
