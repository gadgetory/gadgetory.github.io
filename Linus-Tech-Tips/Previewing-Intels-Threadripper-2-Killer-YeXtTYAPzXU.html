veer demo on stage where they had this
like this like chilled liquid cooled 28
core overclocked processor I don't think
anyone could figure out what exactly it
was they were trying to accomplish even
Intel themselves didn't seem to know
what was going on because that seemed
CPU although not cooled by chilled
liquid was actually on display the next
day with their board partners like a
soos only to be quickly yanked away and
then we haven't heard anything about it
since then except for a leaked roadmap
that seems to suggest that Intel is
planning what appears to be a knee-jerk
reaction to AMD's 32 core thread Ripper
2 a 28 core based on as far as we can
tell a similar platform to their
existing Xeon Platinum now I don't know
what segments they're gonna target with
this workstation enthusiasts people with
more money than brains but whatever it
is I realized something we actually have
in our hands both the 32 core thread
Ripper 2 and Intel Xeon Platinum 8180
which rumor has it will be very similar
to the upcoming enthusiast chip I'll be
it without overclocking so today we are
gonna put them head-to-head as a preview
of the ultimate heavyweight showdown of
CPUs we're not sure who is going to buy
and the whole thing is brought to you by
video blocks video blocks is a great
subscription-based resource for
downloading stock footage video and more
check it out at the link in the video
description
so while eivin puts the finishing touch
on our LGA 3647 bench over there i'm
going to walk you through what our
otherwise as identical as we can get
them test rigs so in here we've got a
thread Ripper 32 core we've got a knock
to a 120 millimeter tower cooler we've
got a zenith extreme motherboard with
high what I believe is 32 gigs of ram 32
gigs right yeah should be and then we've
got a GTX 1080 Samsung 840 pro SSD and
an RM 850 eye power supply now bear in
mind that any results that we show you
guys for this guy have to be taken with
a significant grain of salt because
Intel will have at least I think a
couple of months to tune the consumer
version of this before you would ever be
able to buy one not that most people
would ever be able to buy one like this
is 10 grand so we don't know how much or
how little they're planning to slash the
price compared to the pro one but like
it'd be cheap so this guy right here has
got same power supply same cooler sort
of except it's like a modified version
that works with LGA 3647 thank you not
too much for sending that over we've got
them both hooked up to power meters and
then it's running an Asus Z 11 PA u 12
it's got the same GeForce GTX 1080
founders Edition and then it is of
course running a Xeon Platinum 8180 now
the RAM this is something that could
affect our results but we had to use
what's compatible with our CPU so this
is ddr4 2666 ECC memory the same stuff
from our six workstations one CPU
project hey it's done here we go
is this broken the cpu what what what
okay adding another Boulder sized grain
of salt to this whole experience is that
this latest BIOS we just flashed no
longer supports the 8180 CPU probably if
I had to guess because of its massive
205 watt TDP so we're gonna have to go
back in time to another BIOS in order to
run our comparison and four hours later
we finally have the solution you know
what screw it we're just gonna run out
we're just gonna run the light of a
thousand suns directly into Ivan's eyes
sorry about that anyway where none of
the BIOS as we tried worked and we
downloaded like one of the earliest ones
that should have been the same as what
we had and it was corrupt right off AC
system whatever it doesn't matter
pointies we're just using our dual
socket board with a single CPU where the
only real consideration performance-wise
is we have to make sure we use a PCI
Express slot that is connected to that
socket so everything's hunky-dory this
is effectively the same apples ish to
apples ish comparison and we are ready
to go so naturally I'm sure the first
thing you guys are going to want to see
after the task manager' porn 56 threads
on this one 64 threads on this one is
probably going to be Cinebench right
it's got a bit of edge boom who will
finish first while those are both
superfast but one of them looks a little
faster one of them looks a fair bit
faster whoa
AMD is a good 20% ahead which makes
sense because even though thread Ripper
two's performance per clock is lower
than Intel skylake architecture they do
have a core advantage so they have four
more cores and watch this we're gonna go
ahead we're gonna run the test again and
we're gonna have a look at what our
clock speeds are well they're going so
you can see here
AMD is turbo Eng up higher when you're
hitting all the course compared to Intel
so round one goes to the thread Ripper
2990 WX test number two the v-ray
benchmark from Kaos groups so we're
running the CPU benchmark here here we
go our AMD processor is pinned our Intel
processor is pinned AMD is looking
pretty good here - Wow and done okay no
matter which one of these things you buy
you're gonna be like going super fast
and three seconds doesn't seem like a
lot of difference but three seconds out
of 30 is 10% faster for thread Ripper -
this is great
tell us more about your gear are you
overclocking liquid cooling or anything
else ingenious for getting a performance
boost does does it show that every time
or is it just when you're like bananas
hey Anthony you ever seen this in the
v-ray benchmark you did it on both of
these I wonder if there's some kind of a
threshold clearly that's a tailored
message yeah no we're not doing anything
ingenious just spending lots of money so
for our blender test we're going to be
rendering the classroom scene and this
one will probably actually take a couple
minutes so we'll come back in just a
moment here man that's a lot of course
it's beautiful you can even just feel
the heat coming off these things this
does seem like a good opportunity to
remind you guys though that this is not
the actual product this is just the
closest thing that we have to it now
this is cool though compared to that
burn test we were running before its
turbo a much higher in real-world
applications even though the usage is a
hundred percent so it looks like they
might be detecting stress testing
applications and throttling down anyway
so that's interesting to know in terms
of power consumption this is one area
where Intel is looking a little bit
better our thread Ripper 2 machine is
pulling 380 watts from the wall remember
this is before we've even touched the
Jeep
and this is with no overclocking on
either of them because our Z on one
overclock whereas we don't know what
Intel's planning to do with the real
chip that's coming and then Intel's
pulling about 265 watts it's crazy they
both feel like space heaters you know
with the fans even with these fans
running at full speed and these are nice
fans oh boy this is not looking amazing
for Intel right now thread Ripper 2
already chewed through the first segment
of the test and I think it's done Wow
 just under 5 minutes for classroom
whereas Intel we're at 5:15 and it
hasn't even finished the initial render
545 I don't think I ever thought I would
see it again AMD's top of the line
versus Intel's top of the line and it
just being a blowout so that concludes
the productivity segment of our testing
and now we're gonna do what neither
Intel Intel nor AMD is going to be
particularly stoked on we're gonna fire
up some games so starting with csgo
well if csgo is anything to go by Intel
looks like they're gonna have a bit
better of a time when it comes to gaming
with that said csgo is known to heavily
favor Intel's current chips versus and
these Zen based chips oh boy
average frame rate 310 dot 21 versus 290
7.85 that doesn't seem right because
this was so much higher hex yeah I don't
know what just happened there there's
like there's no way
okay well take those results with even
more salt than the rest of this video
because there's no way that's right that
doesn't make any sense
alright our test is done
we can go ahead and quit the game okay
so these are more like the numbers we
were expecting to see in csgo that
brings us to our final game shadow of
the Tomb Raider how to benchmark on the
same account with two pcs at once you
got to do the ethernet cable shuffle it
goes like this
ah play game there we go now this is
closer this is really close with all
these character models Intel is actually
enjoying a pretty significant advantage
average FPS 100 average FPS 87 so a
significant advantage but it should be
noted that a gaming advantage from one
of these CPUs to the other is not
particularly meaningful if you wanted to
game you would run out and you would buy
you know secondhand 77 hundred K and
overclock the snot out of it
oh right thermals we're not done yet so
we already have a pretty good idea of
what we're gonna see here simply because
the power consumption on Intel's
platform was so much lower yeah so this
is consistent with what we saw before
with Intel's course coming in about 5
degrees lower so there you have it guys
I said it before but it bears repeating
take everything you saw here with a
grain of salt because we don't know what
if anything Intel will change about the
real product that they're supposedly
coming out with I mean something like an
increase to the all core boost
frequencies could make a significant
difference to the results that we got
today but what it looks like for now is
that for the first time in over a decade
in a pure who's got the biggest wheelie
competition because I don't know that we
would necessarily put a two thumbs up
recommendation behind either of these
depending on pricing AMD might have the
bigger Willy
who'd a thunk it
