maintenance has been kind of easy to
ignore because all I had to do to not be
able to see come check this out
colored foam at the top of the water and
the reservoirs and the disgusting amount
of dust on the motherboard was to just
cover it with hoodies and galaxy s 9s
and that sort of thing
but it's got to the point where it's
actually loud like listen to this that's
because of all the air in the loop so by
popular demand
welcome to desk PC water cooling
maintenance a video that is going to be
absolute power
brought to you by thermal tank there p90
core tempered glass case features 5
millimeter thick glass and angled open
frame design different layout options
vertical GPU mounting with a riser cable
included and more check it out at the
link below
because this thing is so large and heavy
during the construction project of the
wall paper TV window we actually didn't
take it out of the room so even though I
did eventually get my filters installed
here look at this look at this if I
touch this filter see that dust there
was so much dust in this room that I
mean even what did get through the
filter has made it just grody
this one's the worst although what's
cool is that for the doubters out there
who thought that the airflow scheme for
this thing wasn't gonna work yeah you're
wrong oh it's inching over falou you
figure I'm probably just whining look
how thick that sucker is Dyson let's
just make this video not about the desk
at all let's just make it about a vacuum
again you guys with you guys like that
I'm just kidding but I do need a vacuum
I
all right Amit Lee hadn't really given a
lot of thought to where to start with
this so one thing I did think of was
that it would be good to be able to pull
these up to drain the weep I don't know
if I ended up actually leaving enough
slack I take kind of a Yolo approach to
water cooling maintenance so you might
as well get as much adrenaline pumping
during that time as you can all right
so this is a little bit tricky because
what we don't want is any water on our
MDF desk it is painted and that does
help us out a fair bit but it is still
suboptimal
to get water on it it'll swell up and
basically get immediately ruined
all right now this is a bit of a hack
now normally I wouldn't recommend
blowing into a water cooling loop
because you introduce all kinds of you
know microorganisms and stuff in your
breath but the reason that we don't care
here is that we are about to clean
everything anyway so it's not a big deal
you would just have to open up somewhere
open up the highest point of the loop
and then drain at the lowest point of
the loop and then the whole thing should
just kind of drain on its own but you'd
have to kind of carefully plan your loop
in order for that kind of a strategy to
work and we didn't because this loop was
more planned for looks and less planned
for so that we can maintain it properly
all right so the adventure just got a
little bit more interesting here this
pump that I'm pulling out right now this
one's fine but if you have a look at the
inlet of the other one there's actually
a bunch of micro cracks where the
fitting goes in check this out this is
very disappointing because it's clearly
not leaking now it looks like we might
have to replace this pump holy crap
this might be a problem I can't even I
can't even take apart the first thing
that I'm pulling out of here oh good all
right one down there's a reason that
most water cooling manufacturers use
Delrin or acetal anywhere where you're
gonna thread in a fitting rather than
plexi like this and the reason that it
is more prone to cracking and
additionally plexi is kind of sucky to
clean because you can't really use
solvents like isopropyl alcohol on it
you got to be very careful
so the fittings we can just go at with
some rubbing alcohol and an old
toothbrush and then one of these
handy-dandy pipe cleaners then for this
guy we just want to use and start with
just our scrap water just to get some of
the gunk off of it so for my next trick
I'm gonna be replacing the PWM versions
of this pump that I have in there these
are great if you don't cut off the PWM
lead like we did when we were installing
it and I'm gonna replace them with the
older regular DC control with a little
knob on the back so I'm actually ending
up with a double whammy of work here
because I got to clean this before I put
it away and I definitely have to clean
this before I use it that is supposed to
look like that
okay alcohol seems to be working a
little bit better I don't mind if the
metal is stained but I do need to get
the bulk of the actual sediment that's
built up on and off this is gonna be
even more challenging oh crap I think I
just ruined this
it's an impeller it's a magnet I just
touched steel wool on it it's all over
it I am gonna pull the one from the
other company
OOP there got two pumps and one
reservoir done the reservoirs are
permanently stained from having an air
bubble their immediate need it know you
had a moment where you thought I might
actually do it yeah I should try to get
this leather reservoirs done
let's go find out if we have any two
things oh this is not a good time not if
I want to maintain the white and black
color scheme anyway I just need a really
long stiff object sorry I had something
cotton my high they unfortunately no not
a meter stick this time has to be
thinner for optimal penetration of the
tubing Jake God get your mind out of the
gutter look at that that right in the
tubing let's actually get the pumps back
into place so while you guys were gone I
got these pumps all swapped around so
they are now d5 Aereo's and fit and
they're all cleaned up now you put your
cleaning stick in you take your cleaning
stick go pick up this jug and try and
wash it down that's what it's all about
okay let's just spit on it to lube it up
spit really is nature's Lube man I mean
not like for this but BAM
no you missed it already it's up it's
done there was no fundamental problem
here just needed more Lube also this
hole is a bit looser
none of the bolts for these pumps we're
tight anymore once I took them off they
all vibrated themselves loose all of a
sudden you're having a heck of a time
before and after baby nah okay there is
definitely some trash in there though oh
that's so dirty
that's actually not as bad as it looked
got a little bit of yellow gunk so
there's definitely cleaning to be that
oh right okay so that's worse it's
scrubbing time you know I don't know how
clean this is gonna come like I could
pull out the scouring pad but but then
I've got metal shards all over the place
and making matters worse I'm gonna end
up with an uneven finish because I'm
only gonna be able to scour some parts
of it there may just not be anything we
can do about this because part of the
problem here it's just that the nickel
plating is being worn away to expose the
copper over time I mean it's a funny
thing about water like I'm not blaming
the manufacturers here water erodes it's
like what it does so we've got some
erosion not corrosion in our block and I
think we're just gonna kind of have to
live with it so I did more closely
inspect this pump top and yes it does
have some like spiderweb cracks around
it but it seems okay I think it'll hold
up for quite some time but that's
actually why it used to be that the
threads were directly in the acrylic on
GPU blocks as well but that's I think
why a lot of manufacturers started
putting these on that and it gives them
compatibility with those multi block
manifolds something to note is that most
water block manufacturers void your
warranty if you open up the block
well how that is a very very poor
thermal paste application there
oh it's health
ah you want to smell it it kind of look
like an oil is I'm sorry like I wonder
if whatever I'm touching is like in kind
of microbe like can you imagine that on
my tombstone here lies - tech tips
sebastian died of weird alien organism
growing in his water cooling wait that's
embarrassing
alright so we're gonna do a slightly
better job of this this time around okay
just a little bit more tubing and then
we're good to go
I'm gonna watch Linus tech tips videos
that guy has no idea what he's doing
alright let's finish getting this thing
filled up Oh what the hell oh crap oh
crap oh this is really bad okay I think
that's enough paper towel thank you I
can't even see what I'm doing okay all
right all right all right jeez it
happened because I opened up the other
side as well and because I can't
remember which order they're in in the
loop but I guess not the one that I
hoped for and so it basically didn't go
very well maybe this one starts spilling
this is OG PT new Petra's tech shop
okay just a few drops of that should
keep anything nasty from growing in the
loop a bubble I see it I see it there it
is finally done
for those of you out there who were
wondering why it is that will take a
water-cooled pre-built system and will
say this thing's beautiful it's gorgeous
it's got great temperatures but we're
not sure if we'd recommend buying it to
a water cooling novice anyone who
couldn't build it themselves this is
basically why because water cooling
maintenance does have to be done and it
is as difficult if not far more so than
the actual initial build but you know
what's not difficult building your own
