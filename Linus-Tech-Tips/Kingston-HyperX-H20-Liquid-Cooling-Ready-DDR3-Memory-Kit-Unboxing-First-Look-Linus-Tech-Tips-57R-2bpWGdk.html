there have been quite a few
liquid-cooled memory kits in the past
but I have never actually seen one in
person this is the first one that I've
gotten to check out so this is a hyper X
performance kit from Kingston and it is
liquid cooling ready you see those
Barb's right there those appear to be
1/4 inch barbs which I will explain how
you can actually make practical use of
even in a custom liquid cooled setup so
these are ddr3 2000 mega Hertz c9
modules it's a 6 gig kit so that means
it's optimal for core i7 on the LGA 1366
platform let's open it up and have a
look oh yeah and there's a joke there's
a joke in this episode that it's just
like the funniest thing ever but you
have to wait till the end if you have to
wait till the end to find out if the
joke is it's really funny enough okay so
here it is HyperX h2o so I'm just going
to lift it up at the Bard's here so I'm
not sure exactly how this heat spreader
works but you can see it's got like blue
accents on it anything like that check
that out so it's got like blue HyperX
style accents and then over top of that
there's kind of like a black and red and
white themed heat spreader here so let
me sort of let's look closer at this and
see if we can figure out exactly how the
whole thing clips together so you can
see there's screws here in here okay and
those go all the way through so
presumably that's clamping the entire
heat spreader down on on top of what
seems to be like a sub heat spreader I
can't tell off the black one and the
blue one are actually like permanently
attached or if they're just clamped
together and then you've got a thermal
interface material between the the heat
spreaders and the DIMM itself they're
not that heavy actually I'm a little bit
surprised they're really not that heavy
it looks like these barbs just go
straight through so you can see right
there so there's no there's no winding
around through the waterblock I mean
really round doesn't produce a lot of
heat so if you're even just giving it
some contact with cool water it should
lit more than adequately and okay that
was pretty much it for the unboxing and
checking out the HyperX h2o the next
part is check out the wait wait for the
dude for the job pay for the joke it's
funny okay this is the joke this is the
joke
so here on the HyperX h2o page it says
it's a delivers high speeds and extreme
performance features a unique extreme
cooling option that uses liquid to
dissipate heat so that's all great and
fine and then down at the very bottom
notice all the Kingston products are
tested to meet their publics
publish specifications Kingston does not
recommend that any user attempt to run
their computers faster than the
published speed overclocking you're
modifying your system timing may result
in damage to computer components so it's
I don't know I just
okay maybe it's not that funny now that
I look at it again but I just thought it
was kind of funny that Kingston's
selling you like liquid cooling ready
memory with a warning not to overclock
it because yeah you're pretty much gonna
do that
oh yeah and the way that I would
recommend running this memory if you
want if you're running like a 3/8 or 1/2
inch water cooling system and you want
to make it compatible with the quarter
inch barbs on the HyperX h2o is what I
would do is I would get like a 3-way
splitter or a four-way splitter and then
just plug up one of the ends and then
actually split your 3/8 inch tubing or
your half inch tubing into three quarter
inch
go into your triple channel memory from
the top come out the bottom meet into
another splitter and then meet up with
the rest of your loop that way you don't
lose a whole lot of flow going through
these tight quarter inch Barb's and
you're still able to get all the extra
performance out of these DIMMs now
that's not to say these won't run just
fine without water cooling if you just
want to run the MER cool that's fine too

of the HyperX h2o and don't forget to
