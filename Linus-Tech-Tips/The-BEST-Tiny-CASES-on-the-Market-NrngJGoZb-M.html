it that counts at least that's what I
keep telling myself and lately you know
what I seem to be getting some backup
here because there's been a lot of love
for big things that come in small
packages if you know what I mean I TX
cases and the motherboards that go with
them have been growing in popularity for
some time but there are some inherent
trade-offs that come with tiny computing
size noise cooling performance and of
course one of the big reasons anybody
wants a small computer in the first
place looks so we rounded up eight of
the best small form-factor designs for
your viewing pleasure come along for the
ride the package ride you bought the
ride package
CyberPower pcs lineup of gaming desktops
feature intel seventh generation core i7
processors check them out at the link
below we'll kick things off with the
venerable Silverstone mellow mlo 8 which
rocks a classic HiFi look this
particular model comes with a carrying
handle along with a vertical stand
should that suit your fancy taking a
peek under the hood reveals a separate
chamber for a full sized GPU which helps
with both thermals and acoustics in our
testing on the other side we find
generously sized front panel cables and
two tool lists two and a half inch drive
mounts for any combination of spinning
or SSD storage take it all together we
think this one's a great choice for a
living room PC next up fractal designs
node 202 a moderately sized media center
style case again with a vertical stand
if you're into that sort of thing and
optional feet if you're not one thing
you'll notice right away here is that
there are no screws anywhere on the top
or the back they are all on the bottom
and thankfully they use standard
Phillips heads something apparently you
can't take for granted
inside is a spacious clean design with
well proportioned cables and a power
supply mount that uses rails for
additional stability all the fan intakes
are filtered including the GPU intakes
dual 120 millimeter fans which we would
recommend using our GPU got pretty
toasty and testing and with two two and
a half inch drive mounts it's a pretty
versatile option crowdfunded on
indiegogo this is the doctor's aber
sentry a polish built mini monstrosity
made entirely of steel right down to the
brackets and vertical stand everything
from the satisfying power button to the
weight of the panels exudes quality
construction getting inside past the hex
bits
you can see a fairly sensible layout
with a separate GPU cooling zone and
slightly long front panel cables if your
GPU is shorter than 200 millimeters you
can actually make use of a provided
bracket to stack up to four two and a
half inch drives in place of one of
these mounts for a grand total of up to
eight drives of course if you were to
actually load in that many drives I
would suggest taking off all their
clothes because in our testing it got
pretty hot in there behind the GPU not
content to provide only one case for our
roundup silverstone also sent in their
raven our v01 ii which i guess we'll
call ron another larger case Ron trades
volume for cooling coming with two slim
120 millimeter fans with space for a
third and convenient magnetic filters
for each of them all of which combined
to give it the top results in our
thermal testing inside we see an
incredibly sturdy PCI Express riser for
two and a half inch drive mounts ample
room to maneuver and amount for a full
sized ATX power supply Ron's not perfect
though between the two long for comfort
too short for reach around front panel
cables he's a little bit of a pain to
service and aesthetically we don't think
Ron fits in well in the living room
making it more of a small ish showcase
piece for the computer den now we're
doctors aber debuted on IndieGoGo the
dann case a for SFX burst onto the scene
by way of Kickstarter it is currently
the world's smallest computer case it's
super light and it's really beautiful
the panels snap on and off easily which
actually could be a problem with how
jam-packed tight things are in there if
not for the optional screw holes it's
extremely space efficient under the hood
with the full sized GPU compartment
separated by way of a plastic flap to
save weight while offering darn
impressive thermals
now the a for SFX is size and lack of
dust filters do hurt its acoustic
performance and a single front USB 3
port is not ideal for the year 2017 but
two two and a half inch drive mounts
give you decent options for internal
storage and while sadly the a4 sfx is
unavailable for purchase at the time of
filming more good news they do have a
subscription service that will notify
you when they're returning to production
moving along to the end case m1 we see
many similarities between it and the a4
sfx it's lightweight constructed from
aluminum and features snap-on panels
though these ones unfortunately don't
screw down its holy get it hole ly
ventilated with two 120 millimeter fan
mounts that we would recommend filtering
and using as intakes to help prevent the
rest of the case from sucking and dust
thanks to its perforated design the M
one's thermals were great even if it's a
little on the loud side and in spite of
its diminutive size our unit includes
amazing Drive expansion with the
optional slot loading optical drive that
goes where you could also mount a two
and a half inch drive and even an option
to mount dual three and a half inch
drives if you like to store your media
locally and you'll want a small case
you'll want to give this one some
consideration it's probably the most
versatile chassis at its size support
for triple slot video cards is just
icing on the cake at that point next up
I hope you're ready matey's cuz we've
got the our agent tech matey plus
affordable with a premium looking
aluminum finish this is a more
traditional looking cube PC much care
and attention clearly went into making
it look and feel streamlined with
brackets hiding the slot screws and the
bizarre power supply mount sadly though
this makes working in it a huge pain and
each side panel is held on by Phillips
screws
rather than you know little quick
releases looking inside though we find
space for up to four two-and-a-half inch
drives or two two and a half's with a
single three and a half or two three and
a half inch drive so the storage options
are definitely a strong point making it
an attractive home theater PC option
even if I can't emphasize this enough
it's not great to work in finally a
brand new chassis to round off our
roundup the BitFenix portal evoking a
certain turret design this is probably
the most overcomplicated case we have on
hand with an inner frame for our parts
to bolt onto attached via a rail this
doesn't leave much room in spite of its
size for cable routing but there's
plenty of cooling which was a big
benefit to the portal in our testing it
even managed to stay pretty quiet for
the portal showing off your build is
just a window option or two thumb screws
away and it features twin quick detach
three and a half inch drive sleds and up
to two two and a half inch drive mounts
so if you want something absolutely
unique you're looking at it as long as
you don't mind dealing with yet another
case that is difficult to work with so
then final recommendations what to buy
for someone with forward-thinking style
the BitFenix portal at 139 us looks
pretty good looks it's got plenty of
options sturdy construction and
head-turning appeal but it's far from
the smallest in our showdown and really
not that small for an ITX case so make
sure you've got the room for it for
those of you looking to build a gaming
grade home theater PC to store and
consume your content
we like the Silverstone mlo eight at
seventy nine US dollars the doctor's
aber sentry does get an honourable
mention here for its stunningly slim and
clean design but at 235 us it's very
pricey finally for those of you who just
want a slick small form-factor PC the
km1 at 185 us is the Cadillac and the
fractal design node 202 at 79 is the
similarly functional if less luxurious
Camry the Dan case a for SFX gets an
honorable mention though when it's
available
but at 230 euro it's a little tough to
swallow though it should be noted that
in spite of their size all of these
cases are relatively easy to work with
and performed very well in our testing
so there you have it
this video was a metric but ton of work
so guys drop a thank you for Anthony max
and Ivan in the comments while you're at
it Cable mods custom length individually
sleeve cables actually did legitimately
help us complete these builds in some
cases and keep it real guys until next
time real small that is do you like
talking to robots and navigating
automated phone trees ha no you don't
don't lie so switch to the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and satisfaction first ting when
you call them you talk to someone
directly and everything about what they
do is all about saving you money you pay
only for example for the services that
you use with the average ting bill
coming in at just 23 bucks per month per
device and if you're stuck in a contract
they'll even pay 25% of your
cancellation fee up to 75 bucks to get
over there so will ting save you money
while all you get to do is head over and
try their savings calculator it's at
linus dot ting calm we've got that
linked below you enter your last few
bills you enter how much you paid and
find out if you would save money on ting
and if you use our link you'll get 25
bucks in service credit or towards a new
device for your trouble so thanks for
