powered by hyperx check out their cloud
to headset down in the description below
also thank you to a sous and Corsair
alright guys so as you probably know
there's been a ton of really big
launches in tech recently namely 950 and
sky lake and asus has been a part of
that with motherboards and graphics
cards so they don't have a ton that's
brand new to show us also known as they
don't have anything brand new to show us
so what we're going to do is check out
some of the systems that around the
booth first off with the NCIX pc this
system is beautiful it was built by the
fabled crazy Ivan if any you guys
remember him I'm sure you knew and if
you saw back at PAX East when we did a
system showcase of the intel booth you
probably remember some of the things
from that video one of them namely was
that I kind of grilled them a little bit
on his droopy or long run water cooling
you can see here it kind of looks like a
hard line set up but it's not this is
soft water cooling tubing Ivan stepped
his freaking game up and this looks
awesome all the water cooling is powered
by ek you can see on the back of the
graphics card they've done some custom
painting to the actual back plates of
the graphics card which looks sick
speaking of custom painting there's
automotive paint on a lot of the area
around the case there's custom
stenciling on the top and the front of
the case and you can see a big a sous
logo on the side that means that they
are officially elite powered by a sous
there are talk to your partner that
means all of their systems are custom
approved by a sous which is absolutely
pretty freaking cool it also features
cable mod cables which have a custom LED
runs going through the cables that they
glow and look super cool there's other
things like carbon fiber accents all
over the place because Ivan really likes
carbon fiber and there is a pastel
colored liquid cooling that actually
matches the cable mod cables which looks
really cool and it goes down to the
detail on every level
for internal hardware there's an intel
i7 6700 k 16 gigabytes of corsair ram a
750 series 400 gigabyte SSD duel 98 East
Rix's zeese 170 hero based Maximus 8
series board and then hx850 I you can
buy this system as is but there's a
landing page or even I think a name for
it yet considering I've been just
finished building this thing like
yesterday so you'll be able to get it
soon pay attention the next system is
from puget and it has a little bit of a
different direction we'll start with the
hardware this time it has an intel i7
6700 k and they suits maximus eight Jean
32 gigabytes of crucial memory and then
they sue Strix 980 TI but that's where
things start to go a little insane the
storage set up on this thing is nuts for
your main drive you have a 1.2 terabyte
Intel 750 nbme drive for auxiliary
drives you have two one terabyte Samsung
850 evos and 36 terabyte WD Reds
ridiculous the amount of solid-state
storage and a hard storage of this thing
is just nuts and if you listen to that
description without being able to see it
you probably expected to be a lot bigger
the amount of stories really fit in this
tiny little box is more specifically
what I should have said yeah pretty
freaking impressive and last but not
least is honestly they're racing rig I
don't think you can just buy this thing
cuz I'm pretty sure they custom make it
every time but it's got a maximus eight
hero z 170 board duel 980 TI Strix is
6700 k corsair SSD and a x 1200 I power
supply from corsair as well and one of
the sickest chassis is ever considering
it's like in a box under a racing seat
that has hydraulics on it and you get to
pit play one of the most badass rated
racing setups I've ever freaking seen
that's it that's my top three I know it
might have seemed like I cop though it a
little bit with that last one there but
honestly it was my favorite system here
outside of the other two that I showed
the other two were cool for specific
reasons like the first one having a
badass liquid cooling setup and the
second one having a badass storage set
up and then that one was a badass gaming
setup thanks again to hyper extra bring
us here to pax prime check out this
little card thing in the top corner to
