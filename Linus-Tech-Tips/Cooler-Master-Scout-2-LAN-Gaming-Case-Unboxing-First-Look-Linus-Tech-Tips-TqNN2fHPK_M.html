the CM storm at Scout 2 this is the
second scout and it brings with it some
incremental upgrades and actually looks
pretty freakin cool from the outside of
the box anyway but we've yet to get it
open so let's start with what
Coolermaster has to say for themselves
first of all there is one 120 millimeter
red LED fan okay seven expansion slots
so you won't be putting any XL ATX
motherboards in here but 99% of the
board's out there are standard ATX RM
ATX anyway slide-out does filter large
rubber grommets for improved cable
management okay seven hard drive bays
one two and a half inch bracket included
removable hard drive cage for Lu long
graphics card installation okay top
exhaust vent release heat steel
reinforced carrying an old carrying
handles excellent tool free optical
drives USB 3 ports for fast charging and
file transfer dual 120 millimeter fan
support and mesh design so let's open it
up and have a look so Coolermaster has a
number of different series of cases
better specifically optimized for
cooling and gaming and all of that good
stuff so the Scout is more along the
film along the value lines compared to
something like you know a half ax or or
whatever else like that which isn't to
say that the scope just because it
doesn't have to have a high airflow
moniker is not to say that it is not
perfectly capable of keeping your system
cool so we've got some okay panel
installation guys don't worry too much
about that and let's get the case opened
up here ooh I like the handle ready so
if you guys do or don't attend LAN
parties honestly it doesn't really
matter because either way I handle is a
really handy thing to have for your case
because if you're unboxing it you might
find that you want to pick it up at some
point the handle is extremely sturdy
actually I'm really impressed by that
and it has a rubberized grip on it that
makes it much more comfortable to use
then plastics the straight planer out
plastic handle so you can see the
flexibility there but also the fact that
there is no give to it what's
ever so there's a metalcore here with a
rubber coating on the outside it's
actually great you can easily carry your
system around like this especially if
you're stronger than me it's not quite
like the like the handles on the cosmos
to have those those beautiful metal bars
running down both sides on the top of it
but I mean this is a more value oriented
case again than the cosmos - so we can't
criticize it too much for that so we've
got fully stealth front i/o there's your
power and reset switches as well as
control for the LEDs right there is
where you'll find your two USB 3.0 ports
two USB 2.0 ports as well as your front
panel audio okay on the front of the
case full mesh so three five and a
quarter inch phase and then filter it's
easy you can see there's a filtered
there's a filtered layer here as well as
a honeycomb mesh layer so what full
front of it is mash and the bottom
actually has a little bit of room for
intake as well we're going to try
popping that off see what we find here
just for just for the balls right okay
so here we find another couple of 120
millimeter fan mounts so that will give
us lots of airflow from that front
honeycomb here we've also got all the
cages for reviving a quarter inch base
and not a whole lot else in the front
one of the things I like about this is
that it doesn't have any of the front IO
pieces attached to it because a lot of
the time you go to pull this off the
case and you end up kind of tugging on
those delicate
whoopsie-daisy speaking of delicate
there we go
back on you end up talking on those
delicate wires and potentially damaging
them so I do I do worry about that this
side panel is pretty straight forward
you can see Coolermaster has bulged out
via the right side panel a little bit in
order to give you extra room for cable
management this is something a lot of
cases have started doing I didn't really
like it at first but I've kind of gotten
over it so I won't complain about it too
much it looks like we lost a rubber
grommet and shipping but it's probably
on the inside of the case not a big deal
that there side panel window shows you
the good parts so I'm not a big fan
sort of weird shape side panel windows
I've seen like l-shaped ones and sort of
bizarre stuff like that I don't mind
this because it cuts off things like
your optical drives which you don't want
to see your hard drives which you don't
want to see just show you the CPU socket
area your memory you can also see you
know from this kind of an angle right
now when we be looking at it your
graphics card but instead of taking
their window and like drilling holes
through it like this like Antec did with
the 11-hundred they've opted to give you
a smaller window and then just regular
metal fangirls which i think is better
actually because the great thing about
these grills is if you do want to see
through them you don't have to put a fan
on it it's fairly you know fairly
transparent see what army this is
awkward um where is on those plexi ones
you can't see through it at all because
of how thick the plexi is so when they
do the laser cutting on it it just makes
it so no matter almost no matter unless
you're looking at it like dead-on you
just can't see through it at all
taking out the side panel huh look at
that not much flex to that at all
actually nice build quality on this
that's one of the easiest ways to tell
if the case has has gone sort of premium
on the materials or if they you know
trying to save a couple bucks on the
thickness of the metal as well there's a
lot of stocks even with that plexi
window in there and all these holes cut
out there's still not a whole lot of
flex in there feels really good alright
have a look at the inside of this bad
boy we've got some included accessories
whoopsie daisies we just grabbed that
alright so cable management holes here
they're using that very very very soft
soft rubber here so almost no matter
what you do in terms of bending it and
sort of trying to ruin it it's going to
pop right back into place and make it so
that you won't see too much of what's on
the other side remember guys there's
going to be a black side panel on the
other side along with all these black
cables which is going to make it
extremely stealthy unless you sort of
like really go out of your way to wreck
it like rip off one of these one of
these pieces or something like that
which I really can't imagine happening
you've got access to all of your usual
places so up here okay up here is going
to be your eight
and up here is going to be where I would
run these down from so I wouldn't run
these through here I'd run them over
here and then bring them down up here
we'll get you up to your optical drives
here we'll get you to your video cards
as well as your 24 pin and one of the
things again okay this is smart so so
often you see next to the power supply
you see something this size and then you
see like three cable management holes up
to the top of the case that are also the
same size which would logically be a bit
of a problem because if there's enough
cables to run through three of these
then you probably need more space at the
bottom because there's there's a lot of
cables coming up so I've run into issues
with builds before in the past but
there's not really enough room to run
all the cables I need through this
bottom hole so they've gone with a much
larger one compared to the ones up here
now the removable cage is from here to
here so that'll leave three three and a
half inch bays even if you do remove it
in order to install an extremely long
graphics card and I can't think of any
graphics card where you need anything
longer than about this even something
like a Radeon 6990 which was very very
long the two and a half inch adapter can
actually be moved around them then this
is actually compatible with up to two
SSDs so you came out one SSD in the top
and then you can flip it over and mount
another SSD on the other side using the
bottom mounting holes side mounting
holes bottom mounting holes actually
very clever very clever little thing
they did and then you're just using your
standard three and a half inch drive
rails pop in there
and throw that back in wherever you want
pull this mechanism for the five and a
quarter inch base pretty bog-standard
we've seen this before from Coolermaster
and in terms of cooling on the top let's
have a look at what they've got up here
so hold on me never really we never
really checked this out so it looks like
there's a look oh I might need a sec to
figure this out guys so I got it off
just by taking out the plastic tabs and
you can remove it for whatever reason
that'll I can't think of any reason
you'd want to so we're just going to put
that back in there it looks like this
case doesn't quite have the clearance
that we'd need for a dual 120 millimeter
radiator in the top you can see the
your motherboard is going to be right
about here with your vrm and all that so
this is predominantly an air-cooled case
and it's a very suitable for that so
let's do a quick summary of where all
the cooling is coming from here so we've
got dual 120 s on the front with full
mesh intake we've got another 120 in the
bottom which should get some access to
air these aren't the tallest feet I've
seen in the past but we've got a nice
rubberized grip most people don't use
this anyway because your power supply
cables are generally there you've got
two 120 millimeter exhausts in the top
and finally you've got a 120 millimeter
exhaust fan in the rear and this one is
LED lit and is wired into the casing so
that you can actually turn the LED on
and off right and last but not least
your power supply which has that
filtered intake which was mentioned on
the outside of the box so you can if
they remove that put it back in no
issues there yeah hey check this up I
got one of those auxiliary auxilary PCI
bracket thing so if you have a fan
controller or whatever else that hooks
up to one of these you don't want to
waste one of your valuable PCI brackets
in the back then you don't have to do
that now I wonder what happened to that
doesn't that rubber grommet camera man
pointing at it there it is all right so
the rubber grommet was included with our
case it just came out and shipping no
harm no foul have a look at the
accessories included and I think we're
going to wrap this up
more three and a half inch hard drives
rails ah we've got some zip ties we've
got a speaker we've got some screws and
whatnots basically what you'd expect so
what do you get with the Scout - you get
a very capable air cooling case with a
very very awesome built in steel handle
making it extremely portable very
comfortable to move around and you also
get a pretty darn good looking case with
side panel window that shows off the
best parts without showing you you know
hard drives and I think that pretty much
wraps it up thank you for checking out
