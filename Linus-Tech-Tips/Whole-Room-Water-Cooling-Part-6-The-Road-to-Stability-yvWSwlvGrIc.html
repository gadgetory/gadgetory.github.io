well it's a beautiful day so we're gonna
go inside and work on whole room water
cooling but first it's time for a haul
video yeah baby
whole time so here it is so much fun
stuff this is from my trip to Home Depot
actually the vast majority of this stuff
has nothing to do with whole room water
cooling some of it is for the hard pipe
a hard pipe build that's upcoming some
of it is just general supplies in fact
the only thing for whole room is
actually this ABS cement so we need that
and yeah the rest of that can go aside
for now then oh this is our new lab by
the way I actually complained about our
lab breaking on a previous previous
whole room water cooling so Road watched
that and they're like hey we have a new
lab coming you should try it
so it's modular so you can actually take
apart all the pieces if it brings which
is kind of cool alright what else we got
here alright these are some pleats
pleats only these are for the mechanical
filter these are some UV sterilizer
tubes a pleat is um Matt you know what
to bleep do okay uh then we've got our
lifeguard mechanical filter so this is
from lifeguard aquatics it's for ponds
but I talked to them about it and they
basically asked me what's your flow rate
what's your overall volume of water etc
etc etc and we agreed that the best way
to keep junk out of the system and
remove the junk that's in there is one
of these bad boys and the best way to
keep anything from growing in the future
is one of these bad boys so I'm going to
be putting these to the sterilizer and
the filter in series in our loop then
I apparently didn't learn my lesson the
first time also I couldn't really find a
particularly better option it is exactly
the same reservoir that we bought last
time again but this time it was on sale
maybe for a reason and boxing skills are
rusty just like our last reservoir open
this bad boy up the first step is to put
these guys together excuse me all about
the maturity here
it's really it doesn't it doesn't look
that big on here well I guess the size
of the box would have been an indicator
oh look it's an open-ended glass tube I
know what these are for small mammals
right well okay well I don't think I was
supposed to take this off yet
oh we're ruining it already there's no
ring I don't know where it goes I got
this
Oh
oh maybe it comes here no oh it's a
compression fitting so I should probably
use it as one hey what I think this is
supposed to go through here
no I don't think so low over open end of
courts leave until entire gasket is
about 1/4 inch of your shield Oh ice
coupling on to cap carefully insert
quartz leap into bottom receptacle
inside the center housing grow up all
right hey this is good oh crap
sorry I didn't have a position just
right there carefully match pins of this
to this match in what way is all god oh
no it's okay
I can't even oh there it is
well that was easy I just pushed harder
I think the cord goes in there oh oh I
see why they want me to use Lube okay so
that's a pleat you know the number of
people who offered me soldering lessons
after my last video you know the funny
thing about that is is most people were
telling me to do it the way that I
normally do it but I specifically looked
up a video on the internet for how to
solder to make sure that I like kind of
did it the way that you're supposed to
so that I wouldn't get a bunch of people
giving me soldering lessons all right I
am feeling good about having filters and
live things killers on my system here so
the mechanical filter is first which
means this goes into so the out goes
into the in with this glue I bought just
if this one gives me a refreshing
Sprint's off at the end it's going to be
probably like super poise tests browsers
how am I gonna get this open holy crap
I think you've glued the cap on this is
not a frame yeah legitimately need it
open
I feel way less bad about not being able
to do this now so brains versus brawn
maybe if we actually use a tool open
well so much for that yeah so after all
that teryn opened it that's right
turn the weak plane hey whose idea was
that I was actually not there I was
gonna do it whose idea I couldn't find
them but I was gonna do it luckily
you're ready I did fetch them thank you
okay I'm sure that no matter how I apply
this the internet will find me to be
wrong and stupid so I'm just gonna wing
it
okay so we'll do some here I've been
outed as not a handyman hello the shame
oh it was a shame thought of changing my
name what's your name and I got y'all
hearted every time that I woman none of
the kids you can probably pull a fart
sound effect from one of the other ones
from today that's what Sharon wanted to
used to open the glue did he really
yep oh my god yeah brains over brawn my
ass my friends you will actually know
less about water cooling an entire room
simply by watching this video than you
did before you started it could be that
you have so much knowledge in this one
video that it's just pushing out all the
old information out of their hands that
was women
we're not sure yet we're just living
blue right now yeah for high on themes
our filter assembly is complete so I
never actually gave an explanation of
what all of this is supposed to do so
this right here is going to filter all
of the physical debris so any of the the
dead bodies of the junk that we have
growing in there now or or did because I
gave the entire loop a blast of iodine
concentrated iodine liquid a little
while ago that should have pretty much
nuked whatever's in there so this is
going to as all that stuff gradually
makes its way out of the blocks and
everywhere else that it's stuck this is
going to filter that crap out then we
have replacement pleats for when this
inevitably gets gummed up and I need to
put new ones in there once it's running
and everything's clear
I should rarely if ever have to replace
these pleats this guy right here is
going to keep anything else from ever
growing again so as the liquid comes
through the system this has a UV lamp
inside that is going to sterilize all
the water that passes through it so this
is my one-two punch that is going to
keep the loop clear now that or well
once it is clear again well we'll clean
it and then clear it keep it clear once
you punch doesn't seem like the pleat
would do everything though alright so
I'm back
20 bucks later I have activated filter
carbon which I don't know there were
like a bazillion different kinds of
carbon and carbon mixtures and find out
what's up with this well okay it came
out real fast so that's good - Media
Group they don't know what funnels are
you know what let's get everyone
disconnected from the whole room loop
and then we'll get in there yeah
and turn this off which off the computer
uh-oh I'm leaving okay good - sex - sex
can you move and I'll do it OOP sorry I
had to film Oh what's going on
hold on okay uh I need the bucket in the
bathroom are you holding it yeah okay
can you get me paper towels or something
no idea okay okay all right
oh it's an o-ring so I was trying to
take off the quick-release Oh discarding
the item iodine is good for your eyes
probably okay um okay we need to get all
the other systems off the whole group Oh
cuz it's gonna be crazy it's gonna be
draining so it's just mine and Brandon's
and Tarin's left which is more than half
of them I'll just hold this yeah I'm
gonna need more paper towels I have this
whole thing thirty Hertz and hits
the fan
I don't why this awesome Oh ring failed
ray
yeah yeah we'll have to replace the
fluid you should say okay mine's already
I film it that's okay guys we got this
I'm terrified of quote it soft light
it's hot it stopped yeah it's making
sense well I'm sorry but it did I'm just
reporting what's happening it's no
longer leaking it was leaking problem
solved pretty good there well what do
you think happened cuz the o-ring popped
out here I just held it Oh whoever
assembled these fittings compressed the
o-ring it's a miracle this didn't leak
before ha ha ha so who assembled it and
do we Merc not just me other people as
well I think you did all of the actual
no because it's not here it's here I
also got David to help mmm
sure blame the god arisen in here yes
and carry Gandhi amigo
ok it could be either of us either I
mean technically speaking neither of us
have and I thought we were done with
this whole project you guys are still
exciting with it it's because it's not
done yet
Aaron yeah I got that your system can
turn back on now okay well I change it
hours of life
well it was important for me to film
what was happening all right so the
carpets wet because I get wet as well
wet socks of the first course RH Adi GT
and h100 IG TX all in one liquid coolers
make your CPU run cooler and they make
your computer look better too and you
don't have to deal with all of this so
for the last month or so we've been
flushing the system periodically putting
fresh well with big showerhead on
putting fresh water into it what I've
observed since then is that while before
with our reservoir in our tubing ended
up looking like this in the last four
weeks and this happened quite quickly in
the last four weeks the new tubing we've
added has stayed completely clear which
means it looks like whatever was living
in our system is no longer being
dispersed throughout it so that's a
really good sign so what we're going to
do then is we're going to power down the
whole thing drain the whole thing
because we've got all of the systems
running independently now then what
we're going to do is we are going to put
our in-line filter in we are going to
give it another blast of iodine and
we're going to put our reservoir back
and then I think we're good to go I
think that's it Brack should be done
unless something else unless something
else breaks thank you all the systems
are good everything is going now is the
time to introduce our sterilizer so I'm
going to go ahead and plug this bad boy
in UV sterilizer so you can see the
light is on which is probably good to
take care of all the microbes that I was
not aware of before that apparently live
in ethylene glycol so this is just our
corrosion inhibitor this time around
this time I don't think that it's a
biocide because it's not
apparently I'm an idiot thanks Taryn
helpful let's let's finish topping her
up now that it's bled yeah
okay I'm coming back up wait you we need
two more seconds of water oh god I upped
it up in Reverse again this is cold</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
