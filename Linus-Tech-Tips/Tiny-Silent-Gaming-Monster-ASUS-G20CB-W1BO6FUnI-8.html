got very limited desk space but I simply
cannot bear to put my computer on the
floor and run ever so slightly longer
wires okay so maybe that's not it
but whatever the reason giant tower pcs
for enthusiasts are going away and these
compact gaming machines are becoming
more and more common but it seems like
everything that I've seen so far has
suffered from one flaw or another but
maybe it doesn't have to be that way
meet the asus rog g20 CB it's the best
all-around mini gaming pc i've seen yet
and it has RGB lighting dance
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to Tritonal
bear for free check out the link in the
video description know it's not quite
gaming console sized the Xbox one s is
less than half the size but the rog g20
CB manages to pack much more gaming
power into it's still very compact
footprint it's got a core i7 6700 quad
core with hyper-threading 16 gigs of DDR
4 RAM a 512 gig SATA 3 SSD and a one
terabyte hard drive for a good balance
of speedy and spacious storage and it
rocks an NVIDIA GTX 1080 graphics card
making it suitable for much more than
the intense Full HD gaming that it
advertises on the tacky sticker on the
front
in fact it absolutely chewed through
every VR application we could throw at
it and made short work of our 4k gaming
test suite as well managing 45 to 60
plus fps across the board with most
games running at or near max details but
that wasn't the most impressive thing
about it what blew me away was how
quietly it did all of this the g-20 CB
is not just whisper quiet when browsing
the web it impressed the pants off me
while I was running an hour long CPU
stress test and doing the same thing in
Doom at 4k and remember this is coming
from the same quiet Freak who moved his
computers into a separate room to get
away from fan and pump noise so it turns
out that the angled shape of the case
and the indent at the bottom are more
than just style they're part of an
intentional acoustic management strategy
the g20 is quiet from a normal sitting
position next to it at a desk but
significantly louder if you listen from
the bottom or the top or the back the
entire front of the system other than
the slim DD
Drive looks like an air intake with a
space-age II rog styled grille but it's
actually blocked off to keep noise
inside the system cool air is drawn up
through the bottom by custom blower
style fans and exhausted by the rear
blower on the video card and through
this wide heatsink near the top it works
so well that even turning the video card
fan up to a hundred percent yielded only
an additional 50 megahertz or so on the
GPU in Doom at 4k one of the biggest
question marks with any pre-built and
especially a compact one though is
upgradability and the g20 CB is no
exception here but if you're willing to
break the warranty sticker I was able to
upgrade the 16 gigs single channel
memory to 32 gigs of dual-channel only
removing about 5 screws and if you're
willing to dig a little deeper the video
card can be swapped asus includes an
extra power cable for you for this and
unlike its predecessor the CB version
has an empty m2 slot under the optical
drive that can be used for an nvme SSD
so with rumor sites predicting that both
AMD and Intel next-generation CPUs will
perform marginally better at best and
the full stop in the trend towards more
power-hungry video cards I don't expect
either the motherboard or the weird dual
brick external power supply to hold back
your gaming experience for a few years
at least so in summary the g-20 CB has
some unexceptional qualities the
terrible lighting control software
treats your inputs as mere suggestions
the dedicated second power plug for the
GPU can be accidentally yanked not that
I speak from experience and the included
SK Hynix SSD isn't the highest
performance I'd seen but at only a $200
premium over throwing all the parts in a
card on Newegg and building it yourself
for a super small and incredibly quiet
gaming computer this one left me very
impressed
