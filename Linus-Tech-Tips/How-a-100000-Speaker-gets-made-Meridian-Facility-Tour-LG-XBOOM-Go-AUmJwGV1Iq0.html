if you rounded up a bunch of obsessive
audio geeks and then locked them in a
building with only the instructions to
build whatever you want and don't come
out til you're done well wonder no
further because LG electronics
graciously sponsored our trip all the
way to beautiful Great Britain to tour
the Rd and production facility of
world-renowned speaker manufacturer
Meridian and this is gonna be a good one
because while on the surface Meridian's
flagship $100,000 speakers here couldn't
be more different from the LG X boom go
Bluetooth speaker that I'm holding they
have a lot more in common than meets the
eye
so let's go have a look shall we this
video is brought to you by LG's ex boom
go Bluetooth speaker line up check out
the special offer linked in the video
description
so during development they worked
closely with Meridian and not just on
the voicing of the already finished
product like you'd see in many other
co-developed audio products meridian was
involved in developing the
specifications of the drivers and the
passive radiators that LG brands as
dual-action base they were involved in
the creation of both the vocal and bass
enhancing profiles and they even helped
with the physical design of the back
cabinet to enhance sound quality one
really cool sort of Meridian
special-sauce feature is actually on the
PK 3 here and what it does is it applies
image elevation to raise the perceived
source of the sound slightly since it's
so common for people to plunk their
Bluetooth speakers on a table next to
them or by the poolside or whatever
so bottom line takeaway from this tour
is an X boom go gonna sound like the
speakers that we auditioned when we
walked in the door no of course not
don't be stupid but the folks here at
Meridian are still proud to take credit
for bringing better sound quality to the
rest of us as well who can't afford
six-figure speakers except for one thing
right the the RGB lighting they actually
didn't want any of the credit for that
no pride they were very clear if that's
on LG you know what whatever I think
it's cool we'll start with a little bit
of history when Meridian launched their
first product in 1977 powered
loudspeakers so ones with the
electronics built into them were only
available in the professional world but
while these were expensive at around two
thousand pounds their strategy of using
dedicated amplifiers for each driver
unit allowed them to split the incoming
signal before amplification avoiding
some of the messiness of a crossover and
actually when the folks here hooked
these puppies up to some Spotify they
were shocked at how well they've stood
the test of time so then you
fast-forward
I don't know was this forty some odd
years and the vast majority of consumer
devices now are highly integrated
containing not just drivers and
amplifiers but even advanced digital
sound processors that can decode high
bitrate streams like bluetooth with
optics HD like this guy and dramatically
improve performance where cost or
physical size constraints had previously
made decent sounding audio simply
impossible but this is fun it turns out
Meridian knows a thing or two about that
as well have you guys ever heard of
Dolby true HD well long story but it's a
method of compressing high resolution
blu-ray audio losslessly that was
originally called meridian lossless
packing and it was invented right here
now the vast majority of product
development is done in software these
days but when push comes to shove you do
have to build one and actually listen to
it eventually so to that end they built
what they call the inner sanctum
including this anechoic chamber which is
used in combination with more realistic
listening scenarios to ensure that every
product that they build here meets the
standards of a group of Golden Ears who
work together to evaluate how closely
the product represents the original
recording honestly speaking though for
me it wasn't the admittedly very nice
good job you guys graphics on the wall
here that blew me away it was the
production floor now I've seen a good
number of manufacturing facilities but
this one is completely unlike any that
I've encountered for one thing it's
practically a ghost town in here and
it's not like they cleared it out for me
or anything that's apparently just the
way that they work they've got far more
build stations and testing stations than
they do people to work at them which
they say is perfect for the small
batches that they produce for their
worldwide dealer network so without
further ado then shall we follow the
journey of a loudspeaker all the way
through well you don't really have a
choice that's what we're doing let's go
first up while they source Baer PCBs
from an outside manufacturer a number of
years ago Murray
invested in their own SMT line which
means that whether it's for in-house
prototyping for brand partnerships like
the one they have with LG or as we're
about to see right now
retail product manufacturing they can
build their own boards in-house so first
up then the board goes into this machine
where it gets a coating of this gray
kind of oozy solder paste that actually
gets squeezed through these holes in the
aluminum template so that it ends up on
all of the contact pads on our bare
printed circuit board then our board
goes into a pick-and-place machine that
automatically places the smaller board
components using computer vision to
ensure that there are no obvious defects
so then from there it goes into a second
pick-and-place machine that handles the
larger components so you can see those
are on the spools right here but we're
actually gonna stop for a moment here
and draw your attention to this Blundell
production equipment cabinet here so
this is pretty cool some of the DSP and
compute chips actually need to be stored
under specific environmental conditions
or they can absorb moisture from the
surrounding air which can turn into a
steam pocket during the final stage of
production and cause damage the more you
know right which I guess brings us
perfectly to the final stage the pizza
oven so at this point here everything on
that board is actually only held in
place by the stickiness of the solder
paste now of course I was being a little
facetious before however much this does
actually bear resemblance to a pizza
oven it's of course a bit more
complicated than that and in fact this
one here can handle both traditional
surface mounts you know with the little
legs around the outside of the chip and
BGA chips which have all the solder pads
on the bottom fun fact by the way when
you're designing a double-sided board
you have
to account for running it through the
oven twice so you don't want to put
anything too heavy on the bottom or it's
all gonna fall off when the solder
remotes so here at the other end out
comes our finished board it sits and
cools for a little bit then gets carried
over to this station where it's scanned
by a combination of optical recognition
software and real live human
intervention how about that now you
might have noticed though in that close
up before that there's still a lot of
contact pads that are empty on our board
here well believe it or not a shocking
amount of the soldering work here at
Meridian is still done by hand so here
we are at one of those stations
unfortunately it's not running right now
I did say it's kind of ghost town in
here but you'll have to imagine it
because this is a really old machine but
a cool one nonetheless so what you do is
you press this button right here and
then pretty much there's these drawers
that are built into the entire table
that come out you take out the component
and then there's a lens up here that
focuses like a red beam onto where you
place the component then you go ahead
and press the next button you grab the
next one and put that onto your board
you build the whole thing manually like
that crazy right
then you take your finish board and walk
over here this little guy is lots of fun
so if you've ever seen a surface mount
component here's a capacitor they've
actually got super long leads on them
and this allows them to be mounted in
multiple ways like you could kind of
bend them like this and then lay them
over on the side but they don't want
that they want it stuck through and then
they want as little excess on the back
of the board as possible so this little
guy right here kind of guillotines off
the back of the leads so that they're as
flush as possible to the back of the
board so they don't short out on
anything
oh I think we're done now we're ready
for the solder wave it's apparently
actually what they call it so the board
goes along this conveyor where it gets
blasted with flux and preheated then it
pretty much passes over this pool of
molten solder that seeps up into the
joints but like gross look at this thing
it's got shmoo all over the top of the
solder pool we don't want that anywhere
near our components well that is where
the wave comes in so it grabs clean
solder from the bottom of the pool and
then it runs the bottom of our board
over that kind of well wave as it passes
by
well no not actually cool at all it's
like really hot actually kind of
dangerous but but like neat so this
machine here is called the flying probe
and given Britain's long and colorful
history of creative torture devices I
wouldn't blame you for thinking that
that sounds a lot worse than it is but
basically it's kind of like a CNC
multimeter it's got 4 sharp probes that
measure every single resistor in
capacitor and then that spit out an
error if a measurement doesn't match the
expected value so you can actually see
this readout here where it's going
around and pokin and proddin at all the
solder points to make sure that
everything is a-okay it actually takes
up to 13 minutes for this thing to test
a single board which I guess in very
small volumes is fine but in mass
production this would be suicide that's
where this tester comes in it uses a
template and then a whole bunch of
relays that are in the machine in the
back here instead of a CNC probe you
later to do that same job in about 20
seconds the only drawback is that these
templates cost a lot and they take weeks
to make why does it take so long you
might ask well because aside from
creating all these little probes
in the front that just all stick into
the back of the board at the same time
you've also got to Oh
wire it up at the back and the worst
part is that if you change one thing
about the design of the board you've got
to make this all over again
so you only do one of these when you are
serious about doing larger runs so then
every single board that comes through
here goes through one of these machines
which seems kind of inefficient doesn't
it
but I guess that's um that's what kind
of stands out about the culture here no
one I've seen appears to be in any sort
of hurry to like meet a quota they're
just trying to build the best damn thing
and if you appreciate that and you've
got deep pockets sick good for you
otherwise I don't know I guess go buy
something else by this stage our board
is very unlikely to blow up if we plug
it in so it moves either as a raw board
a half-built product a finished product
or some combination of the three into
human testing land here that is to say
the land where humans test it not the
land where humans get tested anyway
meridian uses a combination of real AV
products and signal generators some of
which were actually designed and built
right here to ensure that every input
and output works the way that the user
would expect before moving the product
to the soaked area over here where it
gets burned in four hours all of that is
just the electronics though now let's
take a look at the cabinets
now gonna put that down Meridian is
known for their DSP tech but signal
processing is not magic and good
physical engineering principles matter
too so you think those speakers that we
saw it they're just made of MDF or
whatever think again these high-end
units are actually constructed from
three layers of plywood with an
additional layer of aluminium as well as
this weird
kind of
reson stuff along with a whack of
internal bracing actually this is cool
even the outer glossy coating apparently
contributes to deadening the sound waves
within the cabinet as completely as
possible so they won't color the sound
and I will say this if nothing else it
makes for a very impressive demo when
they are literally shaking the ceiling
tiles of their showcase room with a 5p
coin balanced on its side sitting
directly on top of the speaker finally
every unit gets bolted together and the
whole thing gets tested here by an
engineer to ensure that there's no
distortion no buzzes or rattles or
anything like that from the cabinet
anything loose then they run a computer
check that can be overlaid with a
reference frequency response curve to
ensure that it matches the golden model
that they've got stored away somewhere
honestly it's rare to see anything made
with this kind of enthusiasts level care
and attention these days
