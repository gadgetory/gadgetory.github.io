west 2016 check the link in the
description down below for something
pretty cool here at the logitech booth
they're showcasing a whole new lineup of
peripherals the prodigy lineup the idea
behind this is that it's hardcore high
level internals with a more approachable
set of externals so less crazy flashy
things and like buttons on your headset
and whatnot but we'll get more into that
later they also have some other cool
features included as well like with the
keyboard where it's water-resistant
which is probably a good thing I hope I
didn't just kill it there's literally
water leaking out of the keyboard but
the RGB s are still on so I think
everything's ok now this is a rubber
dome keyboard with membrane plungers and
before you all go but Luke you said that
there was high-level hardcore internals
it actually feels really good I haven't
felt a membrane keyboard that felt like
this probably since the original G 15
although I haven't touched it like in
the same day so I don't know if it's
exactly the same but it does feel
extremely good for membrane keyboard and
I am 100% certain that it would trick a
lot of you if you tried it without
knowing that now in terms of the
lighting it is rubber dome so it's not
perky lighting but there are a number of
zones that you can control and they had
some challenges here getting the
lighting to pierce through all of that
gel the membrane the rubber dome all
that kind of stuff was rather difficult
but they've done a great job and it
looks very good it has a game mode
button that disables your windows keys
it has your lighting brightness button
which doesn't work right now because I'm
in like a demo mode where it's just
plugged into a USB battery bank don't
worry about it there's also media keys
for your volume muting things forward
backed pause play stop all that kind of
stuff but nothing else no like extra G
keys none of that kind of stuff the rest
rest is built in and is fixed onto the
keyboard look even more liquids pouring
out of it right now there it goes
man I poured a lot of water into there
and it also has feet on the back which
can make it stand up more and if you
poured a whole bunch of water into it it
can make it drip even more water out
which is great still works now to be
clear it is water-resistant and they're
not overselling this there's no IP
rating they don't want you to submerge
this they don't want you to spray water
at it with a water
gun no it's just going to be very
resistant to accidental spills or some
idiot at a Consumer Electronic Show kind
of thing pouring water on it like me
next up we have the G 403 which is a
wired or wired / Wireless combo mouse
the wired one which I have right here is
a $69 Mouse the wired / wireless mouse
is a $99 most night it has the same
technology in it as the G 900 that we
checked out in Switzerland earlier this
year I suggest checking that video out
as it beat out all of the wired mice
that we tested against in both movement
latency and click latency which is damn
impressive
now the wired variant weighs 90 grams
plus the option of a 10 gram weight and
the wireless option weighs 107 grams
plus again the option of a 10 gram
weight it has 16.8 million color RGB
lighting and only six buttons no crazy
extra ones there's forward and back left
and right click dpi select and pressing
your mouse wheel down but the most
important part the sensor it has a pmw
3366 that's a sensor that we saw in the
g502 the G 900 a sensor that has been
loved by a huge amount of people no
compromising on the insides like I
mentioned earlier it has extremely high
level wireless technology and an
extremely high level sensor next up we
have the g2 31 prodigy headset this has
40 millimeter neodymium drivers a
flexible boom mic for talking to your
friends also cost $69 features volume
control and a mic mute on a little box
partway down the cable including a clip
on the back just because you want to
attach it to your jeans or something and
then it has a breakout cable which can
go to just audio and microphone or a
4-pole plug if you want to plug it into
something like your phone or maybe even
your laptop the prodigy Mouse isn't as
nice as the G 900 the prodigy keyboard
isn't as nice as the G 910 the prodigy
headset isn't as nice as the G 933 but
they're not trying to be they're trying
to be exactly what you need and cheaper
which is good they all start at $69 with
the Mouse jumping up to $99 if you want
the wireless function and that's an
interesting idea
shooting for nice internals but not the
extra stuff on top what do you guys
think let me know in the
down below thanks to Razer for sending
us to PAX West 2016 they brought us here
on behold of the 3 million subscriber

wicked laptop so check out the link
video description down below I would
highly suggest that you enter for that
it's got custom design graphics from
Ed's ejogo and stuff it's absolutely
