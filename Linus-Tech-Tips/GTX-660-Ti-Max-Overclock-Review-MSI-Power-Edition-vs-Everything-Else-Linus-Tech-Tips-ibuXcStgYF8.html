overview of the overclocking prowess and
value of the gtx 660ti power edition
from msi so that's the part number right
there basically if you're shopping for a
gtx 660ti that is the one you want and
I'm about to show you why because what's
cool about video card reviews is they
tell you all kinds of performance
numbers and benchmarks and metrics and I
go yeah like this card firms like really
good this one performs really like not
quite as good and you know this one is
better than both of them like those
those kinds of those kinds of things are
interesting and then what they often do
I often often do is they take the card
that's being reviewed and they overclock
it and then they put it back onto the
graph and compare it against all the
other cards well I'm not doing that what
I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
delivering no stock results for any of
the cards in this comparison I will be
delivering only overclock results so the
ones that are gonna be in my comparison
aren't going to be the what the heck is
this alright Radeon HD 7870 Hawke okay
sapphire HD 7950 so this is a reference
PCB but with an aftermarket cooler okay
so these are the two radio on cards on
either side of the 660ti pricing wise
I'm gonna have a reference GTX 670 I'm
going to have an on reference but non
triple over voltage gtx 660ti and then
i'm going to have the 660ti power
Edition from MSI now what's cool about
this comparison is that kepler video
cards that is anything that's not a
power Edition or a lightning there's a
lightning over there somewhere Lightning
anything that's not one of those does
not support over volting on the GPU so
even if you use an overclocking utility
like MSI
after burner you will not get any
support for overruling
the graphics core so what that means is
your overclocking will be limited right
off the bat so I was really interested
to find out what's better an msi power
Edition or a $100 or will $90 more video
card a GTX 670 without over voltage
support so first I want to go through
what kind of clock speeds we were able
to obtain so the most important ones are
the 660 the two 660 t is so we've got
the galaxy g GC clock which we were able
to get an additional 90 here it's on the
core another hundred ninety Hertz 90
megahertz on the core 100 megahertz on
the memory and we have the fan pinned at
80% and then on the on the 660 power
Edition we maxed out the voltages in the
power limit just because we were doing a
quick and dirty overclock I'm not
necessarily recommending that for 24/7
use but we've got 200 megahertz on the
core 400 megahertz on the RAM which
really goes a long way to making up for
the narrower memory bus compared to a
GTX 670 and we got the AMIA defense
being pinned at a hundred percent
nominal so let's take a look at some
performance numbers here so let's start
with Crysis 2 the first thing that we
notice about this game or while this
benchmark is that the 7950 is a beast
overclocker
and when you compare that to something
like the max overclock you can get out
of the GTX 670 reference card which is
fairly close to the start clock well
that's very interesting isn't it because
the 7950 is slower to start with but
actually they become neck and freakin
neck as soon as you overclock them with
the 7950 edging out the 670 in our test
the other interesting thing is check out
the 660ti power Edition which by the way
is almost $100 cheaper than a 670
referenced but minimum FPS are right
there maximum FPS are right in there
we're talking 5 percent slower our
destiny maximum what I meant to say was
average and it definitely beats out the
non triple overvoltage capable card when
it is also maximum overclocked on the
7870 is just not even not even the
running
your folks sorry I was letting that
camera turn it drifted I did that if you
want my Skyrim bench really favors the
in video cards and you can see again
here even though the AMD cards put up a
good showing even you know especially
when they're overclocked this looks like
a bit of an anomaly here the 660ti power
edition or gets really close to that 670
reference once they're both maximum off
remember the 660ti power Edition started
out significantly slower than a 670 and
then it just blows away in terms of
minimum fps especially so you can see
that it's possible that we are memory
bandwidth limited here remember that
power Edition card because of its
capability of overruling the GPU the
memory and the PLL was able to get a 4x
overclock on the memory versus what we
were able to do on the the non triple
overvoltage capable 660ti and again we
see the overclocking capability of the
7950 really shine through I think if we
had a GTX 670 that was capable of over a
full ting the GPU core such as like an
msi power Edition of that one that we
might see a much closer race here you
might be able to squeeze another 10% or
another 12% performance out of that 670
and you can see this time 660ti doesn't
make up as much head room are as much
ground on the 670 but the maximum
overclock of the power Edition versus
the non power Edition again helped it to
achieve 10% more on minimum fps and
about 10% more on average FPS so if
you're gonna spend an extra 10 bucks on
a $300 card which basically amounts to
3%
you might as well get 10% extra
performance so thank you for checking
out this little analysis of the
performance of the power Edition versus
a non power Edition and bear in mind
guys I know this is an extremely small
cross-section of titles but given that
we're comparing two identical
architectured cards we are looking at
real world performance gains to be had
from the extra overclocking Headroom on
the msi power edition so thank you for
