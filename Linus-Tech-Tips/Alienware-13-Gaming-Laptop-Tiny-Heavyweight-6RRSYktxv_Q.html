Oleg I mean I've been waiting for
something to bring CRT like response
time back to the PC since Canon crushed
my dreams back in 2010 by officially
discontinuing development of their sed
technology
well OLED has that potential but so far
the best OLED displays are LG TVs which
have notoriously terrible processing leg
so the pixels can be as fast as you
please but gaming still feels like
telling your friend in the next term
which buttons to press for you which
okay sorry I digress okay so the display
I'm talking about
OLED gaming display it's connected to a
laptop the Alienware 13 r3 now with a 13
inch OLED display in case you hadn't
picked up on that before let's take her
for a spin
Corsairs ml fans feature magnetic
levitation technology and custom
engineered rotors to provide a high
performance low noise experience learn
more at the link in the video
description the Alienware 13 strike says
fine a balance between tastefully
aggressive looking and gaudy and tacky
as any gaming PC with an alien theme
possibly could and rocks a pretty strong
i/o configuration with USB type-c and
type-a SuperSpeed ports on the right an
additional type a and dedicated
headphone and mic ports on the left and
gigabit killer Ethernet mini DisplayPort
HDMI 2.0 Thunderbolt 3 Alienware
proprietary external GPU dock connector
and power in at the back flanked by some
large rear heat sinks that vent hot air
down back and up for optimal cooling
immediately noticeable are both its size
and weight considering the Alienware 13s
13-inch screen size so the numbers
listed on dell site are meaningless the
depth is based on the edge even though
the center is a full centimeter more I
can't for the life of me figure out
where they measure the twenty three
point three millimeter height and the
width is off by a whopping six
centimeters oops but anyway when I
measured it myself
it worked out to about 2 liters of
internal volume so for comparison the
razorblade 14 with quite similar specs
comes in at less than 3/4 of that while
weighing half a kilogram less so how can
Dell justify it
well easy upgrade ability is one good
way making our way to the bottom these
five normal Phillips head screws are all
that stand between you and the m dot two
slots that you can use to upgrade or add
SSDs and RAM slots that you can use to
install up to 32 gigs of DDR 4 Ram just
like that inspire and value gaming
machine that we checked out here unlike
that one however the Alienware 13 is
packing some serious heat under the
plastic cover that protects all the
stuff that you shouldn't be tooling
around with this tricked out config got
a core i7
HQ quad-core with hyper-threading 16
gigs of ram a 512 gign beany SSD and a
vr capable gtx 1060 with 6 gigs of Ihram
that ended up packing more of a punch
than I expected more on that later first
let's flip this puppy over and talk
about the important stuff that you're
going to see and touch every time you
use the machine the RGB lighting there
are nine lighting zones including this
is the first time I've seen this one an
RGB trackpad which admittedly actually
looks really cool too bad its
functionality could be improved it does
track accurately and feels very
responsive to the touch but I found it a
bit small and I found the chin of the
laptop combined with the depth of the
clicky buttons below made them a little
bit awkward to use fortunately the
keyboard is mostly good news typing
experience wise it's not the best that
I've used but it's far from the worst
the layout is very good with full sized
arrow keys and the long travel distance
and reassuring tactile feel were great
for gaming on top of that for a small
device it feels surprisingly not cramped
maybe because Dell ended up stashing the
speakers on the side of the unit which I
was all geared up to complain about
until they totally kicked my ass with
solid output volume which is necessary
when using speakers on a gaming laptop
fans and surprisingly lifelike 3-d
positional audio they ended up being a
highlight of this machine along with
Windows hello presence detection which
by the way is still freakin amazing but
not as amazing as the display boy is it
beautiful so my config has the optional
2560 by 1440 OLED touchscreen monitor
that boasts perfect black levels
shockingly vibrant colors and some other
advantages that were like a breath of
fresh air for a gamer who grew up on
old-school CRT monitors look
at the difference in mouse movement to
screen movement response time here the
blade 14 at about 40 milliseconds at 60
Hertz is far from the worst I've seen
but the Alienware 13 is right down
around 25 milliseconds a full screen
refresh faster which only accounts for
faster processing time the pixel
response times contribute equally to the
perceived clarity and responsiveness of
the display because they keep the image
looking crisp even during fast camera
pans it is awesome which doesn't mean
though that it's perfect it suffers from
best buy TV syndrome a little bit in
that color saturation is off the hook
but with a little bit of tuning of
in-game gamma controls I think you'll
find that most of the shadow crushing
effects can be countered for an unreal
if a little small gaming experience
let's talk performance and usability now
the Alienware 13 scores pretty well here
in spite of the beefed up battery off
wall life is unexceptional at about two
hours and change in PC marks
conventional work tests and one hour of
continuous Crysis 3 gaming but it runs
fanless ly under very light loads stays
much quieter than the blade 14-under
gaming loads maintains reasonable
surface temperatures on both top and
bottom while gaming and manages to do
all of that while performing as well as
the blade 14 they both end up falling
behind a desktop GTX 1060 probably due
to power delivery limitations but
remember guys that's to be expected
especially on one and a half to two
liter machines which leads us then to
the obvious conclusion the Alienware 13
is the hands-down winner right well
maybe not who made a better computer
personally I still prefer razor's
approach but while I'm not ready to
switch to the MacBook Pro full-time I
also don't really gain that much anymore
which means that I'm
willing to make some compromises there
for reduced weight and a larger display
with that said the Alienware 13 is a
better pure gaming machine in almost
every way the webcam kind of sucks but
the display is better the keyboard is
better I mean the list goes on
io cooling noise I mean heck even alien
where's external GPU enclosure is
cheaper if you want to upgrade your
video card down the road just like the
blade don't expect any of that to come
cheap because this is a serious toy for
serious
ballers speaking of serious toys tunnel
bears adorable it's got these little
bears and they like tunnel around but
they're also serious and that they
seriously encrypt your connection and
make it easy for anyone to browse
privately and enjoy a more open and free
internet yes my friends tunnel there is
