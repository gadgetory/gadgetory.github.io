Intel campus is actually going to be on
the subject of Intel's SSD reliability
their manufacturing and testing
processes and you guys are going to want
to check that out on my NCIX comm
channel so that's youtube.com slash NCIX
comm for those of you who still haven't
subscribed to both channels it's totally
worth it the other ones really good too
this is just for fun so Intel has as you
can see basketball courts here on the
campus there's the building you can't
really see it but there's an Intel logo
at the top left not only do they have
basketball courts but they also have
beach volleyball Gatineau courts pits
whatever you want to call them however
of the two sports basketball is the one
that I'm least terrible at so for our
cool factor video today we are going to
be stress testing whether this intel SSD
can handle my poor basketball playing
skills so okay we're gonna force it to
watch well I go at this here and here we
go and up yes okay so what we're gonna
do now guys is we're gonna take this
intel SSD because as you know Intel SSDs
and Farewell SSDs in general are all
about reliability so while Intel has the
lowest failure rates in the industry the
in general they are still more reliable
than hard drives especially in
applications where they're going to be
subjected to shock such as in a laptop
so let's take this throw it inside a
laptop of the actual Intel employee the
genuine one who is filming this episode
and find out if it still boots up so
here we are we it's a very simple
operation to change the hard drive in
this notebook so we took our image drive
through it in the notebook it booted up
quick fast as we've come to expect from
this SSDs and the touchpad is not
working because this particular Intel
employee prefers to use the old
fashioned keyboard nipple thing going on
you know
move it around like that um so here just
to show that it is actually working
we're just gonna open something how
about oh how about getting started there
we go so yes our SSD still works so the
general message here and this is going
to be most of what I already say in the
NCIX tech tips video if you guys have
already seen that the general message is
going to be Intel puts a phenomenal
amount of effort and R&amp;amp;D into making
sure that their SSDs are the most
reliable in the industry if that means a
product gets released on a different
time schedule compared to their
competitors then so be it so this was ah
shoot what series was this can you
signal me like how many went after the
five was it a one or two 520 it's a 520
thank you so in this case the 520 series
SSD was actually significantly later to
market compared to their competitors
with SandForce controllers but because
Intel insists on setting the bar for
where they want the performance and the
reliability and then forcing the product
to meet it before they bring it to
market they ended up rewriting dramatic
amounts of the firmware as well as
making sure that they use only the
highest quality of the NAND that they
manufacture themselves so thank you for
checking out this little practical
demonstration I know it didn't really
prove much but a hard drive definitely
would have died where the SSD didn't so
at least prove that much thank you for
