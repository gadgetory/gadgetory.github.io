anyone who's purchased an electronic
doodad of some sort has experienced
performance degradation over time how's
that iPhone for runnin for you these
days but what exactly causes your
devices to go from hero to zero over a
span of just a few years
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description so today's
investigation was actually inspired by a
conversation thread that I saw over on
reddit about the Radeon R X 480 graphics
card announcement video we did with Raja
coterie from AMD where one of the
commenters suggested that AMD's practice
of loaning graphics cards to reviewers
then asking them to send them along to
another reviewer could hurt their
benchmark scores due to the cards
becoming worn out the back and forth
discussion that followed is something
that I've seen a fair number of times in
the context of whether or not it's safe
to buy used computer parts especially
cards that have been used for
cryptocurrency mining but it's one that
I've never seen actually tested now the
problem is that new hardware is
impossible to go forward in time and
make old so no investigation into like a
GTX 1080s performance degradation over
time can really be done and that old
hardware is very very difficult to find
in still brand new condition that is to
say unless you've got friends in low
places like EVGA x' Warehouse for
example where just such a thing was
found by my bud Jakob over there this is
a brand spanking new still sealed
reference GTX 480 a six-year-old
graphics card and this is a reference
GTX 480 that was extensively used for
benchmarking moved to my personal rig
then used for benchmarking some more
with plenty of rough Linus tech kids
handling in between so if there's any
card that could have degraded due to
hard use mistreatment or heat this GTX
480 is it so let's unbox the new one and
see if this one's performance has
degraded
this is not my most graceful unboxing
ever that's alright
stop you're leaving point to the video
and it's so crazy to see a failed
product new packet
yeah there you have it brand-new
no hmm I just ate a brand new shaggy and
you could tell if they had packaged up a
used one and send it to me because the
thing about for ATS is this surface
stains when you touch it so you can tell
this is legitimately brand new and has
been sitting in that box for somewhere
between four and a half to six years
because it is pristine so there it is
that's our card
so I'm back from all my testing and
let's run through the results here for
my test bench to avoid any hardware
bottleneck so that's still running warm
I'll be using a very different class of
hardware than what was available in the
GTX 480 era a core i7 59 60 x8 core
Extreme Edition 128 gigs of DDR for RAM
and all of that running on an Asus x99
deluxe 2 motherboard I'll be beginning
this then with a look at temperatures
and rock clock speeds compared to what
is advertised if the card is actually
throttling down while under heavy load
then a discrepancy here could save me a
lot of trouble running any other tests
for this I used our Crysis 3 skybox
thermal test which is both real-world
and one that puts the card under 100
percent load spiking it up to almost 90
degrees on the GPU core even on an
open-air test bench with a fan blowing
down on it a reminder to the fanboys out
there that life is regrettably not as
simple as AMD cards run hot or nvidia
has better drivers
it varies significantly from product to
product anyway speaking of varying
significantly they didn't both cards
behaved identically here after 10
minutes with our brand new card
requiring 1% more fan speed for the same
701 megahertz core clock and 90 degree
operating temperature let's move on to
other tests then 3dmark usually has some
variation from run to run but both of my
4 80s got it on just about equally with
future mark comparing our rig here to a
gaming laptop from 2013 in spite of the
beefy CPU
but let's run some real games then
Crysis 3 at high details and textures
shows us that the GTX 480 is still a
reasonably competent gaming card whether
it's brand-new or very old and I guess
this test is also a testament to the
repeatability of our Crysis 3 benchmark
run because they came in pretty damn
near the same the canned benchmarks in
Batman Arkham origins and Grand Theft
Auto 5 tell a similar story leading us
finally anticlimactically to the
conclusion other than their cooling fans
which will whine or stop outright when
they fail video cards like most computer
hardware have no moving parts and
therefore do not generally suffer from
gradually declining performance from use
over an extended period of time
in the same way that lets say a stick of
chewing-gum wood which does not mean
that they don't wear out electron
migration momentum of electrons
eventually causing atoms to move can
cause circuits to fail and this is made
worse by heat or by overclocking it's
just that the way that they fail is not
generally gradual or predictable it's
more like the way that the roof of your
house would fail it totally works until
such time as it doesn't totally work and
you get water on your head and it's time
for a new one so if your iPhone or your
laptop like a video card doesn't have
any moving parts then based on our
testing today the reason for its
slowdown that is to say if it's storage
device is still running well is more
likely to do with software with bloated
applications like anti-malware packages
or malware itself pick your poison right
running in the background and operating
system updates that are designed with
more overhead for newer faster hardware
being the most common culprits so as you
can imagine for a technology YouTube
channel
use technology here in our office to
improve efficiency a lot from the
inventory system that we added when we
moved into the new office so we don't
have to just be like oh hey does anyone
have the 4790k to the much improved
tracking system for all of our videos
ads vessel releases YouTube releases etc
that has replaced the old whiteboard and
handwritten notes so just as we are
improving efficiency in our office using
technology HP is using new printer
technology to help improve your office
experience so they're featuring the
pagewide Pro MFP 477 DW which has
best-in-class printing speeds prints
four times more pages than standard
cartridges with their page wide extra
high yield cartridges and allows you to
save on printer ink on electricity cost
and on time because the best possible
printer in my mind is the one that sits
in the corner and is completely
invisible except when you need it to
work and just freakin works because you
don't have time to tinker around with
something like this when you need oh I
don't know talent release forms for a
shoot that you're running out the door
to do or whatever the case may be so if
