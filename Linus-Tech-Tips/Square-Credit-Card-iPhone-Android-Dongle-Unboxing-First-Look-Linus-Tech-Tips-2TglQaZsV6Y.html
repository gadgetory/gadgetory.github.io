I think is really cool now i don't know
if you guys have heard of square but
usually when i think of square I think
of you know pants that that are hiked up
to about here and then glasses I'll need
to borrow these thank you okay so we've
got classes and we got me like you know
like an overbite so this is what I think
of when I think of square I could be
wrong maybe maybe square is not about
that at all actually I know for a fact
square is not about that at all because
the kind of square i'm talking about
shirts tucked in there exit is it
totally different kind of square this
square is square top see a square
comsquare th /f are if you live in
quebec and good for you if you do um
this is the way for everyday Schmucks
like me or you or anyone else to take
credit card payments from people which
seems sort of like bizarro land like how
does just anybody take a credit card
payment because I mean it wasn't that
long ago that you know even like it's
not that long ago that pizza started
being able to be paid for by credit card
so it's just kind of crazy so what you
do is you sign up it takes just a couple
minutes so I signed up because I was
sort of curious about this you're ready
to accept credit cards you download the
app from the App Store Google Play which
I've done on my iPhone sign into your
account and plug in your card reader get
paid fast funds are automatically sent
for direct deposit your bank account so
you can take Visa and MasterCard you get
a couple little stickers that you can
put on your shop or your car or wherever
else you're doing business out of I
suppose let's go ahead and get signed in
here so you open up the app there you go
square app and it is as simple as wait
for it wait for it keying in a number so
let's say eighty eight dollars and
eighty eight cents swiping a card swipe
card to charge or you can clear it or
whatever else you want to do and it's
apparently that simple now I'm not
actually going to swipe
hard but you can see the dongles very
straightforward so it just takes a
magnetic stripe you can actually take
payments by keying it in as well but
they have a different they have a
different charge rate for that so just
like credit card fees and this is this
is a funny thing a lot of consumers
don't necessarily know when you pay with
your credit card the retailer or the
restaurant or wherever else they are
getting like peas up the wazoo so you
guys you know enjoy your travel rewards
and your cash back and all that stuff
it's coming directly out of the
merchants pocket at the end of the day
you are getting charged for it so what's
cool about what's cool about this is
that the rates are actually fairly
competitive with what you'd encounter if
you used visa or mastercard on your own
so I think it was something in the
neighborhood of two and a half or two
point seven five percent maybe I can get
some confirmation do you remember and he
doesn't remember okay but either way you
can go to square calm and you can find
out or actually I don't know if it's
square da gamba square not see a for
sure you can find out the rate so I
thought it was really neat so I picked
one up it was free they shipped it to me
for free so now I have one now I can
take credit card payments from people
for whatever reason I might want to do
that and it'll cost me a few percent off
the top but you know if I had to have
someone you know someone told me a
hundred bucks and I knew that they were
totally flaky and I knew they had a
credit card and I knew they didn't have
any cash in like we're there together
because you know what I'll eat the three
dollars give me my ninety-seven bucks
and we're good so so that's that's how
you can do that sprint dongle don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
from our unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and for those of you who
are wondering this is not a sponsored
video in any way shape or form i don't
care if you sign up for square but i did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
