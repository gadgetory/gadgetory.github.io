for this actually hold on a second let
me just let me just fix well no you
don't it's it's already set I said
before we did anything I think so you
don't have to change oh right this one
no no oh oh
okay you know what I just forget it I'll
just I'll host it you you operate the
camera let's just go back to the very
opening things what's uh what's this
video about again nice t-shirts Oh at
all right now I remember why you're
doing this
okay let's go cooler masters casemod
World Series is your opportunity to show
off your modding skills and win great
prizes entries close February 7 to 2015
click now to learn more hey guys what's
up Brandon here so SD cards they're
boring right
Linus officer thought so but they're way
more exciting than you probably realize
mine's changed no okay fine
but on to my actual point SD cards are
one of the most important things I
personally use on a day to day basis and
while I get some flack for the number of
them I've collected over the years like
if I didn't have them I wouldn't be able
to do my job so learning about them for
me was a worthwhile investment and I'm
going to share some of that knowledge
with you guys to start with we need to
demystify some of the confusing numbers
and letters associated with the
different classes of SD cards because
there's a lot of them class 4 class 6
class 10 uhs-1 UHS 3 does your brain
hurt yet let's break it down
each of these numbered classes
represents an increase in the minimum
write speed in megabytes that our card
can handle with UHS one and UHS three
two noting the most recent ultra
high-speed cards recently there's been a
lot of hype about consumer devices that
can shoot 4k video and 4k support and SD
cards which is why the UHS 3 standard
was introduced and is the focus of our
video today does it matter
do I need a UHS 3 card to shoot 4k video
well I wanted to know one I also wanted
more SD card support so I asked Linus if
I could put in a few sample requests and
he said uh yeah I guess as long as you
do the benchmarking on them so I did I
ended up with nine cards in total and I
ran a number of different benchmarks
including crystal dis mark as well as
some real world testing on a Canon 60d
SLR and our lovely Panasonic gh4 which
is a 4k 30fps capable camera these two
cameras will be amongst the most
demanding cameras that can run on SD
cards with the higher performance
options like our fs700 requiring SSD or
proprietary media something that you can
see in this video here so how did we do
well the numbers speak for themselves
most cars performed in crystallises mark
as expected within the range of their
rating benchmarking was done in an msi
gs70 with the built-in card reader which
I used out of convenience when I
observed its results were pretty much
identical to the one we were getting
with the standalone Kingston USB 3
reader now crystal dis mark is only a
synthetic benchmarking software and
those numbers are not necessarily
representative of real-world performance
where other factors like camel former
can come into play so onto our
real-world tests for the gh4 test I shot
multiple 30-second and one minute clips
on each card the first clip is in 4k at
30fps shooting at a bit rate of a
hundred megabits per second the
second clip is in 1080p at 30fps
shooting in a very stressful bitrate of
200 megabits per second I was astonished
to discover that every single card in
our roundup worked perfectly with the
gh4 I did a combination of static shots
with a slow pan and tilt with each card
when playing back the footage in
Premiere none of them had any drop
frames moving on to the Canon 6d test I
shot 30 raw stills per card using the
burst shooting mode here are my camera
settings to give a visual representation
of this I recorded audio of the shutter
during the test the audio bunch that you
see here are the 18 raw still that can
be taken within the cameras buffer and
every spike after that is the following
picture leading up to a total of 30 to
my surprise the sony card came in the
slowest in this test even with its
higher read/write speed compared to the
lower end a dated and kingston cards
with sandjas cars taking the win with
very solid performance in the shortest
amount of time so conclusion time is one
SD card really better than another yes
is it absolutely necessary to have a UHS
3 card for 4k video
the short answer seems to be no for now
while only half the cards in this test
are classified as UHS one they all
managed to have high enough speeds 10
all the 100 to 200 megabit bit rates of
the gh4 s recording modes but in future
cameras we might see higher support
periods and you need to be careful to
get the card that can handle the right
speeds to match it should be noted that
if you're shopping that read speeds are
far less important than still only
coming to play when ingesting footage
that you've already shot something that
is rarely the bottleneck with our
workflow so thanks for watching let me
know what you guys thought of the video
if you enjoyed it if you want to see me
talk about tech on the other side of the
lens more like I said he would pay for
me to go to nab this year so please
leave lots of honest feedback under the
video I really want to go to NAB so even
if you hated it
you probably should tell him that you
loved it and all right all right all
right all right all right all right all
right yeah just getting pathetic over
there so guys like he did say though
please do leave comments if you enjoyed
Brandon's first on-camera appearance
ever he really is our resident expert
when it comes to this stuff and we
really appreciate you guys watching this
video we also really appreciate our

Club is the way to get inexpensive high
quality shaving supplies delivered

because it's more of a butter it goes on
clear so you can see what you're doing
they've got their aftershave and they've
got their then this is always a fan
favorite one wiped Charlie's which are
peppermint scented bought wipes for men

sign up and start shaving time and
shaving money it's one of those things
shaving time and shaving money I get
flack from you guys when I do the shave
time shave money thing and when I do
save time save money I feel kind of bad
because their slogan is shave time shave
money even though it's a bit of a cheesy
joke but they're kind of cheesy guys
