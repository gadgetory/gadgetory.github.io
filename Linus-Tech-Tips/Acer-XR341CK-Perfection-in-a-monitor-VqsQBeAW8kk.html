sick and tired of compromises what if
someone just made a monitor that
compromised nothing
I want ultra wide I want an IPS panel I
want a high refresh rate I want high
resolution I want the works
I want the whole works presents and
prizes and sweets and surprise isn't
that really what I sounded like okay
fair enough but this isn't a movie this
is real life I am NOT getting turned
into a blueberry or drown in chocolate
or whatever I am getting the Acer XR 341
CK a am under that isn't perfect but hoo
boy we are getting really really close
Corsair delivers real neck or nothing
with their new strafe mechanical
keyboard featuring genuine German made
cherry MX key switches click on the spot
right here to learn more a sir you guys
going to look at how everyone else does
this you got your standard corporate
site product page with inoffensive color
scheme then you need to have a stylized
sub site for your gaming products that
communicates the things that gamers care
about inter direct fashion I was blown
away when the single most interesting
specification of the XR 341 CK a for me
anyway wasn't on the product page I mean
to be clear the stuff that is on the
product page is pretty sick we're
talking thirty four inches of gloriously
curved ultra wide 21 by 9 aspect ratio
screen here at my ideal resolution of 34
40 by 1440 so no scaling required in
Windows but much sharper looking than
1080p at this size a full sRGB color
space capable LED backlit IPS panel with
a 4 millisecond rated response time
perfect for gaming and content
consumption DC backlight control for
zero flicker and reduced eye fatigue and
whoa
adaptive sync aka AMD freesync if you go
through the certification process is
included over the DisplayPort input so
say goodbye to the tearing associated
with vsync off my friends now hold on a
minute Linus you're saying there's
something cooler about this monitor from
a gaming perspective than the fact that
it's the first curved 34 inch 1440p with
free sync yes I am this monitor runs at
a maximum refresh rate of 75 Hertz and
if you don't think that's a big deal
you're wrong
the difference between a hundred Hertz
and 144 Hertz is possible but difficult
for me to perceive by contrast and I've
talked about this recently on some of my
gaming notebook videos the difference
between 60 Hertz and 75 Hertz is night
and freakin day now some of you will
know that while I use an LG 34 you see
97 at work and I
I'm such an advocate for ultra-wide that
LG sent me a 3d printed action figure of
myself standing next to a bunch of ultra
wide monitors I'm still running in rog
swift PG - 7 8 Q at home because for
gaming the color fidelity and immersion
trade-off has not yet been worth it to
me to have to deal with 60 Hertz refresh
screen tearing and relatively slow
response times that all changes today
gaming on this sucker is simply put
freaking awesome would I recommend it to
professional eSports competitors no
they're still going to want to be using
standard aspect ratios and are going to
want every edge they can get so bring on
the 144 Hertz refresh rates and one
millisecond response times but for folks
who gain simply for enjoyment this is
the best experience that I've had yet
much better than surround with those
bezels in the way but I realize I've
gotten ahead of myself a little bit here
I completely forgot to do an actual
overview of the monitor at the back we
find but loads of inputs to full size
DisplayPort 1.2 Zanda mini with two HDMI
2.0 ports one of which is MHL compatible
a headphone jack and power for the
external power brick and the uplink and
four down links for the built-in USB 3.0
hub round out the i/o also at the back
we discover that vase amount support is
more than an afterthought but you
probably won't even need it because the
monitor supports the essential organ AMA
key justments tilt and height adjust but
there is some disappointing stuff back
here - glossy plastic never looks as
good in person as it does on a product
page and the way the connectors stick
straight out causes undue strain on them
if you change the height of your monitor
not to mention that the top DisplayPort
lock can't be released without finding a
skinny tool to help you these kinds of
things should have been caught at some
point in the design process moving
around to the front the top and side
bezels are thin perfect but I'm really
not a fan of the two-tone chin bar bezel
should be like children as unobtrusive
as possible unless I have a specific
reason to interact with them which leads
us to my next negative point the
on-screen display
controls are among the worst I've ever
encountered the buttons aren't labeled
they're mushy it requires three clicks
to get into the menu the only saving
grace here I think is that there's
almost no real reason to go in here for
most people the default settings on the
monitor
normal overdrive DP 1.2 in HDMI 2.0
enabled low input lag mode and even the
default color mode are all pretty darn
good but can you quantify pretty darn
good yes for the first time ever I
actually can
thanks to my brand-new i1 basic protune
spectrophotometer and Cal 9 5 ultimate
software big thanks to those guys for
providing this gear by the way I can say
that while the XR 3 41 CKA doesn't quite
achieve the 100% coverage of the
standard computer sRGB color space that
it claims it is damn close at 99.4% and
while our color checker test does reveal
some deficiencies in orange and yellow
accuracy if we throw out a couple of
outliers here almost everything is
sitting in the delta e of 4 or less
range with a delta e of less than 2
considered to be basically accurate
greyscale performance looks pretty good
to me as well with a bit too much
emphasis on blues which is typical of
all but the most high-end LED backlit
displays resulting in a cooler
appearance and blacks getting crushed a
little bit but nothing too alarming on
the subject of backlight there's some
bleed in the corners as seems to be
typical of these curved monitors but
again nothing that I would consider
detrimental to the experience of using
it though your mileage may vary as mine
is an early engineering sample but I
guess that's sort of this monitor in a
nutshell there is a lot of good here
with complaints that will not affect the
usability day to day and if you're
willing to shell out its admittedly very
expensive asking price you may get
another happy surprise to using
invidious display overclocking tool I
was able to get 85 Hertz on this puppy
85 Hertz ultra wide 1440p be still my
fluttering heart only the lack of g-sync
prevents this from when
my coveted Editors Choice Awards since
Nvidia currently has a stronger offering
at the high end of their product stack
where buyers of this monitor are more
likely to be shopping but we should see
that remedied shortly if what I heard
from a little bird is anything to go on
speaking of birds
crunchyroll but it's a site created by
anime fans for anime fans they offer the
most current episodes of new shows
straight from Japan like Kuroko's
basketball 3 and JoJo's Bizarre
Adventure I'm really going to have to
change that script at some point because
at some point those aren't going to be
like the new shows and they have a large
collection of the most popular anime
series like Naruto in one piece all of
the content on their site is
professionally subtitled and if you head
over to crunchyroll.com slash Lynas
linked in the video description you can
get 30 days of crunchyroll premium for
free that means new shows within hours
of airing straight from Japan with
professional subtitling 1080p streaming
being able to stream anywhere on a
variety of devices like your phone
tablet or game console and the best part
is if you decide you like premium then
all you have to do is pay 695 a month to
continue it so head over to
crunchyroll.com slash Lynas to check
them out thanks for watching guys if you
disliked this video I think you know
what to do
but if you liked it then please do press
that like button consider giving us a
contribution through our forum maybe
change your amazon bookmark to one with
our affiliate code we have instructions
on how to do that in the little cards
and the eye up there so that kind of
helps us out a lot I kind of lost track
of what I'm talking about so now that
you're done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so
click that little button in the top
right corner there to check out a pretty
sick video where I build a computer
inside a mini-fridge
whoo see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
