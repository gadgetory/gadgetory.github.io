time for bioshock infinite hosted by
none other than the one and only not me
yay slick will be hosting it learn how
to benchmark BioShock Infinite with
slick okays dreamy eyes oh go away go it
go it talk talk and an alright guys so
this benchmark is starting out on the
Comstock Center rooftops chapter right
after you get the shield upgrade we're
just gonna rock through the warehouse
storage area here in the back of the bar
and then go to the hook grabbing little
part before you jump down and actually
fight the guards so we're just going to
soar across the rooftops by grabbing on
please hooks here real quick one thing
to note is in my benchmarking runs I
wait until I stop like shaking on the
hooks until I'm in a more static
position and then I jump to the next one
just to make my pacing right you jump
down and just wreck this guy's face
because that's awesome go down the
stairs here and I'm going to go a little
bit on the long way but it's just better
for pacing and consistency or a fireball
over here to take care of those guys
nice and quick and then kill these two
on the right side I'm dealing with that
straggler I'm going to take up this
turret your shield should be able to
defend you throughout this entire
benchmark pretty much so I wouldn't
worry too much right when I see this
slot up here between pillar I throw a
fireball because it helps take care of
at least one or two guys and we're going
to fight off the rest there we go we're
gonna fight off the rest of the police
barge and then kill the other police
barges turret and get off my back a
little bit I miss that guy but he'll be
on the roof on the other side so it's
not a problem did you two do and we go
over to this roof and we're clearing
this roof as well we're going to kind of
do a snake pattern
just to make sure that we get everybody
we jump down oh he got a little bit
close but oh there we go that works
we'll come along here and then I jump
all the way down to the bottom of this
next roof but then I turn around then
turn around here and then jump
individual on each box just for better
pacing inconsistency in through the room
to the left then go down the stair or
look down the stairs and then pause
right here and within a second or two
your game should end once you look down
the stairs and that's about it I hope
you guys enjoyed this this gives you
some idea how we benchmark bioshock
infinite because we do believe in real
world benchmarks with real game run
throughs so that you guys can replicate
the results on your own and compare
against our test benches so you can make
sure that you're you know keeping us
accountable for what we're doing on our
side here and you're making sure that
you get the most fair possible results
for the benchmarking that we do don't
