been growing at a staggering rate 63% in
viewing hours since last year and while
you might think that the majority of new
streamers are tuning in on their
smartphones it turns out that connected
TVs claims the most growth with a 103
percent increase in viewing hours
year-over-year so what's the best way to
stream to your TV a 180 dollar Apple TV
a cheap Rando Android box off Aliexpress
how about something in between that
right there is Xiaomi zni box S which
you can buy from Walmart for 60 bucks
it's 60 bucks and it has a $70
chromecast Ultra built in you know what
else is built in by the way this message
from our sponsor Origin PC origin PC
builds custom desktops and high
performance laptops with free lifetime
24/7 tech support and they use only
high-end components like samsung's 970
Evo SSD s visit Origin PC today at the
link below
at first I didn't believe it I mean yes
the box and the website both say that
the me box s has chromecast built in but
they don't specify chromecast ultra the
4k HDR model so while the me box s is
advertised as a 4k HDR streaming media
player I assumed they were trying to
pull a fast one on us and that yes it
could stream 4k Netflix but then casting
would still be limited to 1080p or
something like that so we emailed our
rep he contacted HQ and lo and behold it
is a chromecast Ultra pretty compelling
considering the chromecast ultra on its
own retails for 70 US dollars while this
little puppy is just 60 and with a lot
more functionality than just casting
it's a full Android TV box so it gives
you an interface to access your
streaming services like Netflix HBO now
and Vudu and if you're feeling
particularly masochistic you can even
browse the web on it so all the regular
Smart TV stuff with some extra perks for
this being a Google certified Android
box so first of all Netflix actually
works and so does the remote if you have
experience with off-brand Android sticks
you might have actually run into both
app installation issues or even this
one's pretty good discovering that the
only way to control it from the couch is
with a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad
second you've got a microphone built
right into the remote with support for
the Google assistant so it basically
acts the same as a Google home except
instead of having all these on
microphones it has a dedicated button on
the remote allowing you to execute
commands to help you adjust your smart
home lights browse the web more easily
and they even automatically find content
across the multiple streaming services
that you subscribe to third you'll
benefit from having access to the Google
Play Store which is not something that
you typically get with competitive
offerings from Roku and as on or well
obviously Apple TV and then finally it's
part of Google's project treble
initiative to have all official devices
receive updates quickly so this one
ships with Android TV 8 but it should
get 9 by December 2018 which means slick
news
features like native support for a
webcam for videoconferencing and the
ps4s DualShock controller for gaming and
there are lots of games actually that
are playable on the me box s with even
more selection if you side load other
marketplaces like the Amazon Appstore
now of course the me box s at one-third
the price of an Nvidia shield doesn't
have the same power as that kind of a
box but it wasn't specifically made for
gamers and it does still offer a fairly
decent experience as long as you don't
push it too hard because spec wise the s
is nearly identical to the original me
box from 2016 so other than improved
thermals and Bluetooth 4.2 it's still
got a 4 core 1.5 gigahertz cortex a53
CPU a mere 2 gigs of ram and just 8 gigs
of on-board emmc storage of which you
will just have 5 point 4 gigs available
out of the box as for expanding that
unfortunately you can't uninstall the
default apps that you don't use but at
least you can expand the devices storage
via the boxes single USB 2.0 port just
don't expect it to be fast while we're
in the neighborhood there's also an
audio out port with integrated spit off'
and a single hdmi 2.0 a port which
supports 4k at up to 60 Hertz and HDR
with static metadata which i guess
actually brings us nicely to our list of
complaints about the me box s while it
does support HDR 10 it does not support
dolby vision which ok dolby vision is
more rare on TV sets and content but the
S comes with Vudu pre-installed that's
where most of the Dolby vision content
is so for most people like raise your
hands those of you who use Vudu
it's probably a non-issue but the point
is that competitive offerings like the
amazon firetv stick just $10 less by the
way do support it it also has some gaps
in its support for high end audio so you
do have DTS master and Dolby true HD but
there's no Atmos and if that's not a
deal-breaker for the a/v enthusiasts
this next gripe will be there's no
built-in Ethernet port now there are
workarounds here like using a USB to
Ethernet adapter but that means that you
have to choose between expandable
storage and uninterrupted high bandwidth
streaming unless of course you have a
sick Wi-Fi access point and no local
interference or network congestion so
then with those caveats in mind should
you buy this streaming solution well if
you're in the market for a chromecast
ultra then the me box S is basically a
$10 off coupon not to mention that at
the time of writing Walmart is actually
offering it in a bundle with a Google
home Mini for just another 15 dollars
that is an awesome value if you want an
official Google certified Android TV box
well the Nvidia shield is more powerful
which is good for gamers and it has
proper support for Amazon Prime video
something that is notably absent from
this Android TV box but given it's much
higher price for anyone else the me box
S is basically a no-brainer and if you
care about local live TV the S can
actually help you there too as long as
you have something like an HD homerun
you can jump to your favorite college
basketball game with a dedicated button
on the remote it's a pretty sweet little
box a big step up from the imported
Android boxes of yester past but thanks
to its laundry list of limitations we
just can't quite recommend it to the
hardcore AV enthusiasts PIAA hides your
true IP address and allows you to bypass
your restrictions and censorship by
making you appear as though you're
connecting from somewhere else and you
can use up to five devices at once it
also helps prevent attacks by blocking
unwanted connections it Auto blocks all
traffic if the VPN disconnects and it
keeps your data out of the hands of
advertisers and other activity tracking
snoops so go try it out at the link in
the video description today
it's affordable and it works so thanks
for watching guys if this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit the like
button or maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured at
the link in the video description also

cool shirts like this one and our
