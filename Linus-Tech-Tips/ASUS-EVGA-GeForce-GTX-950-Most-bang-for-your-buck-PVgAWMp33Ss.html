might be super exciting cards the cards
that are really flying off shelves
aren't usually they those top tier bank
breaking beast machines they're they're
more reasonable workhorses just like
with cars people like to look at the top
end for what they want and then trickle
down from there to what they can
naturally realistically afford but let's
take a moment to leave that sports car
on the lot and take a spin in the sedan
like this video if you want to see
scrapyard Wars
3
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
click now to learn more as far as raw
tech specs go the gtx 950 is rocking 768
cuda cores with a base clock of 1024 and
a boost clock of 1188 on memory side of
things that has 2 gigs of gddr5 running
at 6.6 gigabits per second on a 128-bit
wide memory interface it also supports 4
displays and 2-way SLI Nvidia is lining
up the performance of this product with
their previous gtx 760 and all of that
was probably pretty expected what was
really cool with the launch of this was
that Nvidia brought to the table a whole
bunch of software options first up in
terms of those software options we have
latency and videos built some stuff into
GeForce experience that will
automatically improve the latency and
MOBA games and by a pretty considerable
amount in their testing they marked the
input latency of a GTX 650 in dota 2 to
be about 80 milliseconds and the input
latency of a 950 to be only 45
milliseconds a pretty massive
improvement of 35 milliseconds they do
this by reducing the number of
pre-rendered frames from two to just one
so that they no longer have to buffer
multiple frames which made a fairly
significant amount of input latency
after that the changes become a little
bit more basic and focus around game
settings like setting it to full screen
instead of just borderless mode which
while it's helpful for compatibility can
hurt your input latency numbers so you
can optimize your MOBA game for all
tamal refresh rate frame rate latency
and image quality in one click pretty
slick but for those of you on higher-end
NVIDIA GPU you may be wondering where
the heck your latency enhancing button
is well Nvidia is only launching this
improvement for 950 owners at first but
never fear it will be coming at a later
date
next up we have stream but I'll get to
what exactly stream is in a moment with
the stream update shadow play has gotten
easier to use now when you're in game if
you hold alt and then press a Z a handy
in-game menu will pop up with your
shadow play options
and they even now allow you to trim and
upload your videos directly to YouTube
add up to 4k resolution and 60fps badass
also in the previously mentioned alt Z
menu you may have noticed the new stream
button this allows you to either just
stream your gameplay directly to a
friend to show off that fancy new title
that your buddy didn't have the cash for
but wants to see and whatnot or show
them how to beat a certain encounter in
a certain game or even play with them
with game stream coop coop supports
mirrored controls and integrated voice
chats you can coach someone on how to
play a game and share the controls with
them at the same time or play games that
actually support co-op mode like say
trine 3 Nvidia recommends an up-and-down
stream of around 7 megabits per second
for both the host and the guest PCs
respectively now finally benchmarking
and performance here with me today I
have not one but two badass graphics
cards one for my soos and one from EVGA
let's get the showdown started they sous
950 Strix is $10 cheaper on Amazon at
170 dollars and features a stock memory
set up with an advertised boost clock
speed of 13 55 although that doesn't
really mean much if you're wondering why
that doesn't mean much check out this
video here where I investigate the inner
workings of the mysterious GPU boost the
Strix features dual DVI out DisplayPort
and HDMI on the back and is kind of a
compact design with a smaller heatsink
and smaller fans than the EVGA card
we'll see in a moment it also features 6
pin power and a nice flat matte black
PCB on the back of the card the EVGA 950
for the win card is a little longer and
$10 more expensive on Amazon at 180
dollars still featuring a stock memory
setup but with an improved advertised
clock speed of 1405 for IO it has triple
DisplayPort HDMI and DVI it features an
8 pin power instead of 6 pin power has a
nice wicked-looking backplate and a much
beefier cooler performance wise it was
rather unsurprising in terms of results
not bad mind you just unsurprising
unfortunately I don't have an R 9 380 to
test against that
would have been a fairly interesting
comparison at only $20 more but I think
you guys will get the gist of it anyways
the performance difference between the
two 950 s wasn't huge but in my opinion
probably worth the $10 Delta to be fair
though there's something to be said
about the compact size of the asus strix
card a lot of people are building small
systems these days and may not be
looking for longer cards just something
to keep in mind in terms of raw GPU
boost performance the asus strix 950 got
a boost clock of fourteen hundred and
thirty megahertz solid more than their
advertised number that's cool the EVGA
for the win 950 got 1493 however for the
same GPU having a delta of 63 megahertz
is actually fairly significant and
pretty interesting in conclusion I was
happy to see Nvidia dropped some really
cool new software tech for both
performance and raw features both system
builders and mid to your gaming rig
buyers have a new variable to consider
which is always a good thing
more options is good and it's a pretty
solid card at that awesome show great
job and on that subject master opcom
which is based around the concept of
group bys where people would get
together and they'd be like a bunch of
people on a forum or whatever it'd be
like yeah what if we all bought this
thing do you think the manufacturer
would give us a deal
turns out that's a thing but it was hard
to stay organized and you had to trust
your money to one person in the group
who from time to time would run off with
it because this is people on the
internet well now we have an organized
trustworthy place to do that master
opcom so right now they're featuring a
drop on the sennheiser HD 7 DJ's that
feature a 270 degree swiveling ear-cups
so you can go ahead and get that out of
the way of your ear DJ style if you want
to hear what's going on around here
let's say for example you have a baby
that you're supposed to hear when he or
she is crying or whatever else and that
drop is already down to 43 percent off
the retail price
if you guys want to check it out all you
got to do is head over to draw dots
slash Linus tech tips and you can sign
up for the drop
math drop negotiates deals directly with
the manufacturer or an authorized
distributor to ensure that you guys are
getting not only a great deal but
genuine merchandise they're good guys so
get
signed up for the site and start
browsing because they have a lot more
than just headsets and headphones I got
things like knives and keyboards and all
kinds of cool things thanks for watching
guys this video sucked you know what to
do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
even consider supporting us directly by
using our Amazon affiliate code to shop
at well Amazon buying a cool t-shirt
that is not this one or with a monthly
direct contribution through the forum
now if you're done doing all that kind
of stuff you're probably wondering what
to watch next so as I can see it behind
Brandon there you should check out the
video on the mineral oil cooled computer
we built right here actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
