powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM ah yeah but it still happened I was
up I maintained that water can be dried
out and if the camera sustains some kind
of impact that destroys it then I can't
just aim a space heater at it but an
Pelican case with foam made for it to be
shockproof it'll handle travel in a
plane okay except that if it doesn't
then who's out eight grand me are you so
you don't have as much skin and like so
I'm parting with the fs700 camera I hope
it meets me on the other side about our
fragile thing which basically means
throw me as far as I can tell what
careers I've ever dealt with
by you I guess if I wanted emergency
exit seat and I said yeah and then she's
like you want a window under aisle I was
like a aisle she was like sure it's
better so I got emergency exit seat in
an aisle
very nice you may actually make it all
the way to the other side
really she they said you were overweight
apparently I have like 16 kilograms
because this is capture the tearful
goodbye the funny part is like I think I
think there's only a little bit of you
making these guys I miss you girl oh wow
okay I'm like the next 10 days together
probably tell me how you feel about that
oh you're gonna know you guys in ways I
don't want to know you
yeah more than you know film this way I
can't film that way so sorry what did
they what did they not like about your
bag
they felt like don't look it was a
weapon they thought my belt buckle not
this one I wouldn't think anything in
that area is a weapon other than the
obvious okay oh yeah they didn't like
that because they saw that Assassin's
Creed
yeah it's Assassin's Creed why did you
bring incessant but you know what is it
let it okay let's just go this is this
is the smart thing see they're kind of
getting ahead of us
good work diesel now it's gonna be a
race go-go-go slick Oh robox eyes but I
can still beat b-roll watch he's not
even gonna suspect a thing
boom moving backwards is my victory
dance load in all likelihood this is a
trap they've they've baited it for you
it has coffee
it has coffee how much I'm having on
sleeping they have hot water but you
could also drink into that I guess you
can just go to the other side don't
worry about it and if I'd had another
wallboard I'd be topping this up too
though diesel and I were supposed to go
to Korea s economy tax we both booked
our tickets at the same time cool story
bro now you can tell me the story okay
um we both look good booked our tickets
at the same time and then I'm trying to
get it to focus on you it keeps looking
at that it must you know what hold on I
might have it on the lake attractive
things setting it automatically now the
YouTube audience loves you so okay okay
okay you try and so you tried to you
tried to get a ticket to Korea and then
I tried to get a ticket to Korea and
then after I booked it they said that I
yeah I'm trying to book another one now
after I had booked it I went to go check
to make sure that it went through
properly and they said that it failed
because of my credit card so I called my
credit card as you to figure out what
was going on because I told them that
the payment was going to be coming
through so basically he got boned they
said that the payment never touched them
they never had a payment request at all
because they were ready for me to get a
big charge on my credit card so
basically my seat just got Jackson house
so I've so you guys are gonna fly there
separately you're not going to get to
stay as long and how much more are you
gonna pay like $150 I'm really not
stoked on the plus side you're not
paying for the hotel on the plus side
I'm not paying
so it actually carried Cooper okay
that's not Diesel's tip for just the tip
so airline food am i right
I asked for pasta so this is evidently
pasta and was trippin it and b-roll
asked for shrimp so evidently he got
shrimp with him bad yeah barely two
options are the same yes completely
completely totally different apparently
we're heading into the quarantine zone
here that seems good welcome to the
party because it's the only pink one but
here's one two three that don't belong
to me what's wrong here well we lost our
driver and diesel and slick found theirs
followed theirs properly and are on
their way to the hotel now it said
something about you said something about
before but the problem is that
apparently
yeah floor one at this market or floor
b1 is car park for and floor b2 is part
part for so we're gonna we're gonna try
the other car part fours see if we have
any luck like that pay for that was the
one we were looking for we found it and
we found well we didn't really find it
