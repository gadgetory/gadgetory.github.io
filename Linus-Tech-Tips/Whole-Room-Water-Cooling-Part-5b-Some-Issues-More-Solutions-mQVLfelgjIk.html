shooting channel super fun there was a
bit of a disaster and all the computers
needed to be recombobulator on their own
loops instead of flashing so we're gonna
do some diagnosis here this is a whole
room water cooling project through my
skype tip looks is crazy I think one
thing that we need to do is get that
second pump in here because I'm having
trouble bleeding all the systems so
here's our big boy second pump and I
have some tubing scraps so we're just
going to hook this baby up
we're going from this outlet to this
inlet to the rest of the room I got to
go I got to go hook up a system before
we start this though otherwise it's just
going to go nowhere so we're going to
put you back on the whole room loop then
we're going to go turn on the pumps for
the whole room lead wow your system runs
toasty when it's just got to do a rat
too many bubbles though so first the
first pump because we don't want either
of them to run dry boom then the second
pump all right let's see if we're
getting better flow rates with all that
extra pressure actually that does look
quite a bit better
ah muttering method and not bad pressure
oh it looks like we're actually getting
more guns out of your system that's
interesting so let's go have a look
maybe it's uh that's not I did not
expect that we already flushed the
systems our attempts there okay not
great well right now your system has a
five by quad radiator just for itself so
it makes sense that it's doing all right
that's weird turning off your pump made
absolutely zero difference the sound in
this computer what is making so much
noise wait what did I just have a clog
Oh wasn't your pump what was it I don't
know let's just not worry too much about
that okay what oh there because dead
silent now okay so this one's purged
hold on a second
oh that's a problem new new new new new
new bad bad bad oh we ran dry absolutely
terrible worst thing ever
cowboy that was not not what we were
trying to do okay that might explain why
it was so quiet now aside from needing
to replace the pump I also need to
replace the power supply for the fans on
the roof because we were so close to the
two amp limit of the power supply we
were using originally that the fans just
don't start up unless I start half of
them and even then sometimes not but
first see these marks right at the tip
of my finger those are gross how those
my biggest I didn't see those probably
double so that means that block
performance is definitely affected by
the growth in our loop even on the
furthest system from the pumps but since
we haven't seen block performance
affected negatively yet what I'm hoping
is we can at least run it until we move
and once we've added some some kind of a
biocidal agent like iodine to the loop
we should hopefully kill that stuff and
inhibit the rest of its growth so we
have to leave those blocks the blocks
will need to be disassembled for
cleaning one of the threads they have to
be replaced right now it looks like that
would be our best bet yes or we could
just irresponsibly not do it and put in
a biocidal agent put an inline filter in
and just kind of go yep good enough and
not clean anything that is another
option
everything's fine out here I wonder if
the fans are still running cannot tell
from here but what I can tell from here
is that I have the I have the soldering
gear that I need to make my new power
supply so I guess why don't we do that
so I have never used this soldering kit
before this is a new one
Oh terrible terrible news
I forgot my wire strippers guess I'll
have to use my teeth or probably teeth I
SmartWatch you have there oh thank you
it was recommended by a guy that I know
that's a good day I think this is
supposed to go in here but I'm gonna go
see if I have wire strippers I
definitely don't have flux though I'm
here I found one in the in the closet
it's from one of the power supplies for
one of these systems so it's all sort of
part of the same inventory for this
project okay so that's on wait a minute
I not only have no flux I I have no
solder I do have to go to Home Depot
Durr
so my you just started making and you
know a bit of an awful noise that
sounded like the screams of a thousand
dying baby needs and here it comes again
I don't know you don't know what dying
babies sound like especially not the
thousand we need to get everyone's butt
Burkle's
system off the whole room loop well it's
a diagnostic process
why not because we want all the pressure
going to your loop to force bubbles out
of it because you're you're at the very
end so you kind of got the bitch loop
spot
all of this seems I'm trying to lose
some bubbles I'm not gonna tip it we
just plant oh okay I'm gonna tip it I
get hit in the head with a hard drive
I'll be upset not as upset as the hard
drives I shouldn't drop hard times like
that said the guy who tipped the system
and drop a hard time before ok well the
bad news is that two pumps is still not
enough to bleed all the systems at once
but is definitely enough to properly
bleed one system at once when before
with only one pump it was like barely
enough cool ok so I've got everything I
need here for soldering I've got my
soldering station I've got my soldering
iron I've got my sponge I've got my
solder I've got my flux pen because I
couldn't find my other thing of flux so
I'll just use a pen whatever okay right
and I have my sacrificial molex
connector that I'll be using to put on
to the end of this and then some
electrical tape to go ahead and see a
little thing up oh and turns out I do
have wire strippers here at the office
so I guess let's get started so the
first thing we'll need to do is cut this
connector off
so let's find out if this works I don't
have my coat actually I'll be fine okay
and bippity Boppity 14 volts all right
12 right he's gonna get to that thing
there's no explanation quick go before
he realizes that I'm back okay
up we go oh it's okay that seems good oh
it's raining right now actually
okay uh you may have to go up there now
I kinda have to pee
Oh nobody's watching um nope hold on
Oh Oh what okay we have one of these
powered over over sada Wow
in fact there are three leads for the
three splitters which means we need to
split this to two molex and then split
it again - OH
I could have just see I could have just
soldered it to that entire harness but
instead I just left one connector I
thought that was all we needed
there seems safe oh okay I guess I could
take it out of cream nothing I hate you
do we have any molex y splitters yeah
that's what I thought no reason because
I soldered the wrong connector to the
end of so the proper solution would have
definitely been to resolder this
especially because I did such a poor job
of soldering it in the first place but
this is what we'll be doing molex to
SATA 2 quad SATA okay so we wire these
up dippity boppity boop no fans are
spinning okay hmm let's try one
oh they're seda so we have all we only
did up one of the grounds it's the wrong
one back down we go oh I can't even oh
yeah they I'll meet you back at the
soldering iron you could grab a SATA
harness from the closet in front of
Burkle or behind him or whatever burying
a bag on the shelf right inside the door
should just pretend - none of that ever
happened got it on the first guy you
have right now because we have SATA
connectors on the fan power splitters up
there we'll be using a SATA modular
power supply harness as our sacrificial
lamb today and we will be attaching
pretty much the entirety of it giving us
a total of four connectors because if we
had just done one connector of
completely the wrong type that would
have been silly if you have any tips for
soldering don't be afraid to let us know
in the comments no trolling
just kidding don't do that that's for 9
volts soldering irons
don't touch that dial my detectives
we'll be right back
save on select intel core i7 processors
and 730 series SSDs with instant rebates
during Valentine's week February 14th to
21st 2015
click now to learn more oh it's hot
which makes sense this could almost be
its own entire episode the comedy of
errors that is line is trying to create
this adapter let's put that is a long
wire it's about one line is height in
height OOP ah I still haven't gone P it
definitely doesn't go away
okay take that suckers
No No
just come back out did I have this clip
to must been tubing there we go
okay that's pretty much it all fans
except one spinning why is there one not
spinning what is going on here what is
this what is this what are okay next
time
on West Coast whole room okay so I
ordered a couple of filters and
hopefully these will filter whatever is
going on in our system oh my god it's
moving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
