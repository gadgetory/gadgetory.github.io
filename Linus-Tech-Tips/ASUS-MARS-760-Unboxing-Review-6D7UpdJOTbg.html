a soos geforce gtx 760 mars now it might
seem like a regular gtx 760 except that
that one comes in a package that looks a
little something like this so no this is
something special with the mars branding
on there we know we're getting something
rog and something a little bit different
so inside the box packed in nice soft
closed cell foam we get the gtx 760 mars
which has a gorgeous direct to you to
style cooler on it with rog color
scheming and branding all over it and
under that we get not one but two
geforce gtx 760 cores each of them
equipped with two gigs of memory clocked
at 6 gigahertz each of them clocked at a
base of one thousand six megahertz and a
boost of 1072 although guys we do of
course overclock the card for our
performance evaluation later and having
a total altogether of 2,304 cuda cores
it also has a much better power
implementation with a 12 phase super
alloy power digi+ vrm system as well as
just an overall better built high
quality non-reference board so for
example they're using their black
metallic caps which are rated at 10,000
hours of lifetime at 105 degrees Celsius
it also has a full backplate unlike the
reference gtx 690 which does a couple of
things so you might be able to argue
that it helps with heat dissipation a
little bit but it but what it also does
is it actually protects the components
on the back and gives more rigidity to
the card so that it's less likely to
flex speaking of rigidity to the card it
has almost none because on the back of
the card it has a backplate it on the
front of the part it has almost a full
yuna sink that actually does contribute
to cooling because it is being actively
cooled by the two fans that are blowing
air towards it on the top of the card we
find a single sli finger this means that
the card is compatible with Quad SLI if
you're running an additional seuss GTX
760 Mars and we find the illuminated
logo so there's a beautiful Mars logo
that lights up when the card is
installed in your case and powered
speaking of power we've got two PCI
Express eight pin connector
if your power supply doesn't have two
eight pins don't worry they do include a
dual six pin to eight pin adapter
although if your car doesn't have dual
eight pins you might not necessarily
want to be running a card like this
because power consumption is high it
actually consumes more power than a GTX
780 Ti and as you guys will see in our
performance testing the performance is
pretty similar these two fans here are
their dust proof design fans so this
offers extended longevity and so they'll
basically just last longer without
sounding terrible and the full top
shroud is finished in a gorgeous soft
touch feel with aluminum anodized red
accents that just I mean guys let's face
it this card won't perform that
differently from two gtx 760 directs you
to z' but what it does do is it adds the
bling bling so let's get into
performance numbers what do we compare
something like this against well a
Seuss's own numbers reference Titan a
lot but I don't think that makes a lot
of sense because Titan is significantly
more expensive and has been usurped by
the GTX 780 Ti which is cheaper and
better performing than Titan when it
comes to gaming applications so we ran
our own tests so we included the r9 290
as sort of our value high performance
option as well as invidious own gtx 780
and 780ti to give us a pretty clear
picture of how it stacks up now because
it's priced pretty similar to a 780ti it
shouldn't surprise you guys that in our
test suite which hopefully we're going
to have up on the screen right now it
performs very similarly to a geforce gtx
780 Ti with that said there are some
caveats so number one is the fact that
power consumption is going to be higher
than an individual card number two is
the fact that you're going to have some
behaviors that are not as desirable as
you might get from an individual
higher-end card SLI doesn't scale
perfectly so there will be situations
where this card will perform extremely
well and there will be other ones where
it just doesn't perform that well or
where to get stability you will even
have to disable a GPU and you are
effectively reducing the performance
that you can get out of it I do
generally recommend that you run a
single more powerful card rather than
running SLI until you're at the point
where you're already buying the most
powerful single G
to you available at which point if you
really need more performance you can add
another one the other issue with SLI is
that even though this card has four gigs
of memory on it only two gigs can be
used effectively because you have to
duplicate the data that's stored in the
frame buffer that is allocated to each
GPU whereas GeForce GTX 780 Ti has three
gigs of memory all of which is usable
and all of that even ignores the fact
that like we said before you could buy
two gtx 760 s which would be less
expensive to get about the same
performance and present a much more
compelling value option than something
like a 760 mars so who is the Mars made
for and the answer is the same person
that every other Mars and every other
area Ceres ROG card from Asus is made
for someone who values the form of the
card someone who values the prestige of
owning one of their top tier ROG class
cards I mean the engineering that goes
into building these cards is very very
admirable and they look the part so I
think that pretty much wraps things up
thank you for checking out our unboxing
and review of the geforce gtx 760
marshall masseuse dont forget to like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment if you
want to let us know what you thought i
mean what would you buy out of these
three options 780ti mar 7 6 TR just to
sort of less expensive 7 60s and
compromise those additional two pci
express slots because this at least fits
within this form factor of one card and
as always don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
