electric vehicles on this channel so far
some have been pretty cool and somewhat
practical others have been cool and
completely impractical and others have
just been terrible but none of them are
nearly as practical as a common
garden-variety bicycle and that's
because bicycles are fast efficient
reliable easy to repair and cheap that's
why I've been riding bikes for over 20
years and that's why I've been so
anxious to try the rad wagon and the
electric cargo bike from rad power bikes
it's got most of the advantages that
come from being a bicycle but it's also
got a 750 watt motor
Corsair boasts unrivaled comfort and
universal compatibility on its void
surround headset featuring a genuine
Dolby 7.1 headphone USB adapter like the
link in the video description to learn
more the red wagon has a 21 speed
gearing system wide all-terrain tires no
shocks mechanical disc brakes and LCD
display with lots of information and
plastic fenders mud flaps and clear
wheel guards for the cargo area it's a
long tail bike and it's heavy at 75
pounds so you won't be doing any tight
maneuvers there's a rear light powered
by double a's but the front light runs
off the main battery the beam is pretty
narrow and not super bright but it will
always shine even if you run out of
power for the motor assembly of the rad
wagon is pretty easy if you have a
decent set of tools the ones in the box
are just okay and there's a YouTube
video to help you out just don't put the
handlebars on backwards like I did and
you'll be fine and while you're at it
please read the manuals among the other
very useful information you'll find
safety warnings like the one about not
putting the seat post too high which I
didn't read and accidentally bent part
of the frame and needed our neighbor
Steve to help fix it again be sure to
read both manuals cover to cover or you
won't get the best experience I
guarantee it at the heart of the rad
wagon is a 7 pound lithium-ion battery
with a whopping 566 watt hour capacity
it even has an onboard 5 volt USB port
so you could recharge an iphone about 70
times but this battery's true purpose is
to power the direct drive hub motor it's
gearless brushless very quiet and runs
at 48 volts with a peak output of 750
watts the maximum allowed by law in the
United States that's a lot of torque and
let me tell you this thing tips but only
to a point
out of the box the rad wagon has a
factory set speed limit of 20 miles an
hour that's as fast as you can legally
go on an electric bike using a bottle
only before US law classifies your
vehicle as a No
pet for which you would require a
license according to Strava great app by
the way I average about 12 miles an hour
on my Cannondale road bike compare that
to 18 miles an hour average on the rad
wagon 50% faster that's respectable
especially considering that the rad
wegen wasn't even built for speed it's a
cargo bike one that's capable of hauling
a whopping 350 pounds that's what this
huge amount of rack space is for there's
enough room for four standard panier
bike bags or two of red wagons Ballard
bags though I did not like the Ballard
bags for several reasons worst of which
is the pathetic attachment mechanism
that has me fumbling with the clips like
I'm in an infomercial fortunately you
can use any bike bag compatible with the
racks 3/4 inch tubing and there's even
more room on the wooden deck and running
boards you can carry groceries boxes
lumber and even people as long as they
weigh less than 120 pounds but don't
tell that to your girlfriend so that's
great but just how much range can you
get on a single charge well that depends
rad powered bikes says you can expect a
range from anywhere between 20 and 40
miles depending upon factors like speed
weight terrain and how hard you're
pedaling I've ridden this bike for more
than 200 miles over the past two months
with a mix of long and short trips but
I've never gotten farther than 30 miles
on a single charge even on perfectly
flat terrain to test the lower boundary
I loaded up the rad wagon with 350
pounds and biked around on pedal assist
mode 3 until the battery depleted I
expected to go about 10 miles but the
bike didn't make 10 miles it made 20 and
shockingly it didn't give up much
performance either easily reaching above
15 miles an hour throughout my torture
test and it even handled a very steep
downhill without losing stability at 30
miles an hour you can't do that on a
boosted board this absolutely blew me
away and so did the results of my new
real-world tests the office to Costco
benchmark where the rad wagon turned in
the best performance of a non
gas-powered vehicle losing to a car by
only two and a half minutes and this
bike gets a lot of
tension from people I get stares
compliments and questions about the rad
wagon all the time of that color man but
it's not all good news the red wagon
does have a few problems and odd quirks
in addition to the mechanical disc
brakes the bike also has a regenerative
brake which is fantastic
but it does not always engage even
though it is supposed to however I've
found that I can force it to engage by
twisting the throttle and then
depressing the brake lever there's also
another USB port on the LCD display but
it doesn't always work I really like
pedal assist mode for long journeys but
it's not great for stop and go travel
because it requires about a half to a
three-quarter turn of the pedals before
it kicks in and it takes almost a second
to disengage after you stop pedaling
that's more of a delay than I would like
out of the box the rear derailleur was
not properly aligned and the disc brakes
also rubbed quite a bit also the back
wheel went pretty far out of true during
my 350 pound torture test I got the
derailleur brakes and wheel fixed at my
local bike shop where the mechanic told
me that every single spoke on the back
wheel was loose so make sure you check
for that before you do any riding but
when the rad wegen was in the shop I
really missed having it around riding
this ebike helped me remember why I love
biking in the first place and I went on
much longer trips that I would otherwise
have done by car
I forgot I even had a car and that's
really what the rad wagon is all about
it's a vehicle somewhere between a car
and a bike and considering that about
half of all car trips are less than five
miles
owning a bike or an e bike for those
longer heavier trips makes a lot of
sense now if you don't know much about
electric bikes it may surprise you to
learn that it's $1,700 the red wagon is
a value option at this price with these
features I could not find a better cargo
ebike seriously if you know of one leave
it in the comments below but the main
deciding factor for a purchase like this
should be one of practicality don't buy
something like this
unless you know you're going to use it
make sure that biking is already a part
of your life and then you can take it to
the next level with an e bike like the
rad wagon by the way if you don't want
this much cargo space they also have the
Red Rover and the rad mini the rad wagon
is fun fast practical versatile and it's
a great value you could even call it rad
it's not perfect but honestly my biggest
concern is that it might get stolen
great job red power bikes for setting
the bar so high I'll be riding this bike
