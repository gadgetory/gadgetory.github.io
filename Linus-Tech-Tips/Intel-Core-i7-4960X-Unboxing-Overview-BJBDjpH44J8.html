for the latest Intel gaming platforms
check the link in the video description
for more details welcome to my unboxing
and overview of Ivy bridge-e it is
finally here so for those of you who
don't keep up with Intel codenames the
last few generations of core series
processors have been codenamed Sandy
Bridge Ivy Bridge and Haswell so Sandy
Bridge largely refers to second
generation core processors Ivy Bridge
generally refers to third generation
core processors and has well is the very
latest fourth generation Core Series
processor that you'll find on LGA 1155
now when it has an e after it that
denotes the higher-end LGA 2011 socket
which has some advantages so this is the
old 39 60 X this is the new 49 60 X
meaning third generation versus fourth
generation although they use one
generation back core technology so to
speak but the point is on this platform
you have some advantages that you will
likely never see on the mainstream
platform number one is the motherboards
support quad channel memory up to eight
dims so that means that with modern 8
gigabyte DIMMs you could actually
install 64 gigs of just regular old
consumer-grade ram on a regular old
gaming board or workstation board on LGA
2011 with a single CPU next up is more
PCI Express Lanes so Ivy bridge-e will
have support for PCIe a 3.0 and you can
run dual graphics cards in 16 X 16 X
pull bandwidth this doesn't generally
translate to any kind of a performance
improvement in the real world versus an
8 X 8 X configuration that you can
achieve on LGA 1155 1156 or 1150 but it
definitely gives you bigger bragging
rights in your pants so there's that
that it's got going for it and finally
the part that matters most to me
personally is that LGA 2011 is where
you'll find 6 core or 8 core processors
now the extreme edition 49 60 X which
runs at a nominal free
Quincy of 3.6 gigahertz and a max turbo
turbo boost frequency of 4 gigahertz is
a six core processor however there are
Zeon's available which will work in
boards like a Seuss's WS series or in
server grade boards or even multi CPU
configurations that will give you even
more performance in highly parallel
workloads that is multi-threaded
workloads such as you'll find in 3d
rendering or Adobe After Effects
high-end video editing and those kinds
of applications so this is where LGA
2011 is great for us because we use LGA
2011 platforms in all of our video
editing workstations so we're using last
generation extreme editions 3960 X's
what do you get with the new one well
you'll get improved power consumption
you will also get slightly improved
performance shouldn't say slightly it's
about a 10% clock for clock improvement
in performance so that is IPC and you
should be able to achieve pretty much
the same top end clock speed giving you
a tangible performance improvement
couple that with some of the perk or
performance tuning options that asus has
been talking to me about and we should
be looking at a performance improvement
that while not necessarily what some
people were expecting will be noticeable
and for those of you who are expecting
anything other than an improvement in
IPC of about 10% over sandy bridge-e you
probably didn't really have your
expectations aligned correctly because
this is exactly what we saw on the LGA
1150 platform going from something like
a 2600 K to a 3770k now I personally was
hoping for an eight-core extreme Edition
I did not get my wish I feel that if AMD
had put a little bit more pressure on
Intel to release like you know I mean
these are 130 watt TDP parts already I
mean I feel like if Andy had put a
little bit more pressure on Intel to
retake the performance crown or
something like that they might have done
a very high TDP liquid cooling
recommended eight core extreme Edition
or something along those lines but alas
we didn't get that so it's left for eons
for the moment either way last but not
least is motherboard compatibility you
can slot one of these babies into your
existing LGA 2011 motherboard you should
only need a BIOS update but double
with your manufacturer to make sure
which i think is cool because LGA 2011
has gotten a very very long lifecycle
out of it going from you know a cross
processor architectures having quad core
or six core CPUs available for it with
that said the 49 30 K and the 49 60 X
are really the ones I'd recommend from
the new Ivy Bridge ease the 48 20 K is
not something that I feel very like I
can recommend very strongly because
while it is a lower priced option it all
you're really getting is more PCIe lanes
and more memory support it's still a
quad core it won't actually perform
quite as well as a 4770k so unless you
really need that ram and you're not
willing to pony up for a 49 30 K then
then that that that might be the route
to go although the really the sweet spot
I feel is the 49 30 K thanks for
checking out this unboxing where I
actually in case you guys didn't notice
never removed it from the box haha don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
from our unboxings reviews and other
computer I mean come on it's a CPU like
the video if you liked it dislike if you
disliked it in comment and let me know
if it's okay to do an unboxing where I
don't actually open the box you look at
the CPU in there it looks like every
other CPU here on open box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
