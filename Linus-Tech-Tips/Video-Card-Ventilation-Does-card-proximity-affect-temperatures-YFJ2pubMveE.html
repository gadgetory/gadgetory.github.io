placement of expansion cards in your rig
and how they might affect your graphics
card temperatures and vice versa well
today we're gonna explore that from a
few different angles how much does it
matter and what scenarios does it matter
and how much do you need to worry about
this kind of problem hit the like button
if you like the idea of three or more
hosts on scrapyard wars and if you'd
want to see that again
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check the link in the
video description to learn more so for
this video we can't actually use our
standard test bench because an open-air
rig would really screw with the test
results compared to a closed-off
standard case which is the majority of
what users will have these days so we
need to go with a fairly standard
scenario computer case in order to
properly explore the temperature changes
in these various scenarios from here I
chose two different graphics cards for
testing a reference 980ti in an open-air
internal exhaust cooled styled g1 gaming
980 from gigabyte to control the
temperatures in the rest of the case we
used a 240 millimeter a IO cooler to
pull the heat away from the CPU and what
is a pretty common use case these days
and we used a control graphics card to
interfere with the airflow of the two
other test cards I use the Titan X as
our control card as it isn't too long
and is it isn't too short but being a
blower style card it shouldn't be
dumping a huge amount of heat into the
rest of our bench and messing with the
card in more substantial ways than just
blocking off some of the airflow I did
our standard crysis 3 skybox test for
about 10 minutes recording temperatures
and clock speeds as I went through using
the current test cards and numbers one
thing to note is that this is not a
direct comparison of whether a blower or
internal exhaust style card is better at
cooling itself but if you want to see
this Lynas already has a video on it so
just check it out up here in the top
right hand corner there were many
opportunities for feature creep in this
video the amount of potential scenarios
was a little insane so we had to tone it
down to what we saw as the most common
possible scenarios of which we decided
on a full-size average like test
graphics cards and a full-size average
length of control card which we placed
either directly against the test card as
close as possible or as far away as
possible on a 7 expansion slot case
which is the bottom two slots so
basically the question is how much of an
advantage are you gaining by pulling
your second expansion card as far away
as possible from the first I think it's
pretty common
knowledge that largely blocking the
airflow to one of your expansion cards
if you have another option isn't exactly
ideal but how much of an impact is it
really well as these are ultimately
different cards and comparing them
together isn't really the point let's
look at them individually first up we
have the blower style card this is our
gtx 980ti
this card already being on the edge of
its cooling capabilities with an ambient
room temperature of only actually 24
degrees didn't actually change what
temperature it ran depending on where
the expansion card was placed which
sounds great at first but what it did do
is pretty substantially change its
affective clock speed due to how GPU
boost works checking the video in the
top right hand corner here if you want
to know what the heck GPU boost does the
difference here between no control card
installed and the control card in the
worst possible position right next to
our test card is a whopping 114
megahertz which would actually be quite
a noticeable difference in terms of
performance but that's not where the
story ends as the difference between the
control card being right below the test
card and the control card being as far
away as possible is still 88 megahertz
which is still a very noticeable
performance improvement just for
optimizing your expansion card layout
but what about the internal exhaust card
well the g1 gaming 980 actually did
manage to get away from the good old
classic and Vidia standard of 83 degrees
while by itself in the case meaning that
when we added the control card in the
furthest away position the clock speed
didn't go down like it did with the
blower card but the temperature did go
up slightly but it still did go up that
being said when we put the control card
right up against it the temperature shot
up to the previously-mentioned
83 degrees and the clock speed shot down
by a huge 139 megahertz whoa
I had already assumed this card would be
impacted more heavily but that's huge
ah so in conclusion this whole thing
probably wasn't as surprising as it was
interesting to me at least
sure bad expansion card placement might
not always even be up to you you might
have
do certain things and sure like I just
said some scenarios you can't help it
and most people won't even run into this
problem because they'll probably only
have one card but there are some
scenarios even if you do only have one
card the ever more popular as time goes
on small ITX style systems where you may
have to put your card directly against a
side panel for instance could benefit
from this knowledge and you may want to
stay wary of that when choosing a case
tunnel bear they easy to use privacy app
for mobile and desktop internet browsing
you can use tunnel bear on iOS Android
Mac PC and they even have a Chrome
extension that lets you tunnel or browse
the Internet as if you're in one of up
to 14 different countries with ease one
of my favorite uses of tunnel bear is
the ability to access websites that are
geo blocked within your country it's
super easy to install and use and they
even have if you have issues that even
have support bears standing by 24 hours
a day to help they currently serve over
5 million users and you can become a
user absolutely free by heading over to
tunnel bear comm slash LTT they give you
five hundred megabytes of data for free
every month but if that's not enough for
you they have unlimited plans starting
at a very reasonable about $6.99 per
month thanks for watching guys if this

through the forum now that you're done
doing all that stuff you're probably
wondering what to watch next so click
the little button in the top right hand
corner to figure out the video I
mentioned earlier where I investigate
the impact of GPU boost hopefully
someone will kind of step up soon so I
can look more into how it affects
internal exhaust cards that aren't
always pinned against their temperature
limits like some lower cards that I
tested earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
