for the ultimate nvidia geforce single
GPU card we can't show you any
benchmarks yet as of the time of
releasing this video but we can show you
how we intend to get them so we're gonna
test it in a number of different ways
against a number of different cards
let's start with the contenders so
there's the GeForce Titan this is the
king of the nvidia gpus it is a gk110
the same card as you'll find in a
supercomputer basically the fastest
supercomputer in the world at the Oak
Ridge National Lab we've got it up
against a 7970 we've got it up against
the previous king of the castle for
kepler cards the GTX 680 we've got it up
against a 660ti just for a more
realistic card we're gonna be running
two of these in sli though to show you
what that kind of a configuration would
be able to do against a titanic opponent
like a Titan and if we wanted to throw a
God into the mix then there's the Ares 2
which is 270 970 gigahertz Edition GPUs
that is a custom card from Asus with a
liquid cooler on it so let's see how
that compares to the Titan so we got a
test in a number of different ways more
importantly than almost anything else
with the Titan is the fact that it not
only performs better than previous
generation products but does so quietly
and with thermals that can accommodate
even small form-factor systems like this
nineteen point two liter case right here
so Titan it's very important to get a
good idea of what the acoustics are like
both on an open bench as well as in a
case so we're gonna be installing it in
that tiny computer and finding out how
that runs for you guys we are also going
to be taking readings using our red mic
on the open test bench so this is at a
12 inch distance from the center of the
fan hub we're gonna be giving you guys
readings of all the different cards here
we are using our LGA 2011 test bench so
that's 16 gigs of memory 39 60 X
overclocked to 4 gigahertz on a p9 X 79
deluxe running on a vertex 4 SSD for the
boot drive so this is pretty
representative of what an enthusiast
would be running on their system powered
by a ZX 12 50 watt power supply speaking
of power supplies we have a UPS running
down here with
wattage meter so that we can take power
readings and tell you guys how these
cards compare to each other so we're
just going to cycle through these yeah
how that works there you go so it's not
nothing's running right now but we had
to log this UPS because the stock fan is
quite loud so we installed a switch on
the side that is run in line with the
fan so that we can actually turn it off
when we're taking our acoustic readings
so this does a couple of things it makes
it so that the room is quite quiet for
acoustics and it evens out the input
voltage to this guy right here which
gives us much more consistent wattage
readings aha monitor configurations so
we want to test it in 3d in surround as
well as on a single large format panel
this is because the Titan has six gigs
of GPU memory that is on one GPU this is
the largest by far single grant a single
core consumer graphics card in terms of
the frame buffer so we're gonna run it
in 3d at 1080p it regular 1080p we are
gonna run it at 2560 by 1600 on a
30-inch monitor and you can see here we
have three 24-inch 1920 by 1200 monitors
we are gonna test the Titan versus the
Ares two in 3-way surround to give you
guys some idea how dual 7970 gigahertz
additions would stack up against a
single Titan remember a single Titan is
only one GPU so you don't have to rely
on any SLI or crossfire driver
optimizations it's just going to work oh
ambient temperatures will be monitored
using our HH 506 our a multi logger
thermometer to make sure that we are
giving you guys an accurate idea of how
each of these GPUs is going to perform
in terms of temperatures and I think
that pretty much wraps it up I did it
the dad yep
enjoy our Titan coverage when it comes
