Computex this year and also thank you to
Linda calm
so the Computex Convention Center just
closed that was our last day here so we
have to make this video and we are
making the video about Galax now Galax
is a new VR headset called the vision
are you surprised they have a VR headset
because I freaking was I did not expect
Cadillacs have a VR headset it might
remind you a lot of an oculus headset
and that's not too surprising it looks
very similar although it does look a
little bit tacky with some glossy
plastic here there and the front of it
actually just being a sticker but that's
probably excusable as this is their
Developer Kit edition and much like dk1
it's a little bit rough around the edges
in terms of spec it has a 25 millisecond
response time 1080p monitor with 60
Hertz of refresh rate 100 degree field
of view and it connects through HDMI 1.4
B and USB 2.0 it weighs 380 grams
without the cable and headband and yeah
so that probably doesn't sound super
amazing but that might actually be ok an
oculus rift is actually fairly expensive
and this vision kit is targeted at a 200
USD price point which is really
aggressive is it worth it I actually
don't know yes it's quite cheap but it's
quite cheap I don't actually know if
it's necessarily worth buying it's a
little low spec for me it might be worth
investing a little bit more money and a
big problem that I actually have with it
and the reason why I'm not so sure about
it is that a game compatibility it's
compatible with some oculus games but
definitely not all of them and I assume
that once the oculus consumer version
comes out and once the vive consumer
version comes out those are going to be
able to play some pretty high-end games
that this is not going to be compatible
with and those games are going to be
more actual games instead of just tech
demos so if you're a developer looking
to get into developing for very cheap
maybe this actually makes sense this is
the developer edition after all but if
you're a gamer looking for a device I'm
not so sure that being said they will be
releasing an SDK in the future so people
can develop for this but again that's a
lot of SDKs just for VR and it's gonna
be a little bit hard of a push moving on
we have their graphics cards I think
this might be the fourth or fifth 980ti
version that we've seen at the show so
far and
have an air cooling and water cooling
edition their air cooling edition has
dual eight pin power and eight phase--
for those eight pin powers it's more or
less the same cooler that we've seen
before on hall-of-fame edition cards
with two and a half's law it's a hyper
boost button on the back and it has some
new kind of styled chrome finishing and
had that before but it looks a little
bit different now I also have to note
that there's no announced clock speeds
for this card moving on to the water
cooling edition it has a custom water
Glock from bits power which actually
looks pretty freakin cool it's a two
slot car instead of two and a half slots
it has 3/8 pin power connectors instead
of two and it has 16 phase power instead
of 8 also it's a limited edition so I
don't know how many are actually gonna
be available and this one also has no
announced clock speeds let me know what
you guys think about vision in the
comments down below or on twitter at
luke underscore LAF are also thank you
to msi for sending us here this year we
would not have been able to see the
vision without them and they have a cool
