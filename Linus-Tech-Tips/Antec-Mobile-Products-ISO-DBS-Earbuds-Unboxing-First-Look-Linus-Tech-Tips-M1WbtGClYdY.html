another aspect of antex new amp thing
they got going on antec mobile products
but one we already have a look at was
the sp1 and this one is sort of a
similar to jam box by jawbone portable
USB charging Bluetooth speaker guy that
actually sounds a lot better than jam
box by jawbone so I'm hoping to see
similar results with these kinds of
devices so here we have the iso which is
for wireless music and calls so it's
basically a wireless headphone with mic
thingamabob ur ok so again this is
nothing revolutionary nothing we've
never seen before just an text take on
the whole mobile products thing ok next
we've got the DDS which is just a pair
of iems so well not just a pair of im's
I hope it's a good pair of iams but I
guess we'll find out once we open it up
so here's the eye so here's what it
looks like on the side of the packaging
here's the DBS let's see what I'm Tech
has to say for themselves on the inside
here so there's lots of languages none
of which look like English to me and on
the back there's English superior design
in your noise suppression remember this
is the eye so this is the wireless guy
ok high definition Bluetooth technology
full range drivers provide exceptional
sound built-in microphone and controls
place and pick up calls compact form
factor DBS one technology superior
designed in deer suppression and up to
eight hours high capacity batteries
alrighty then let's open that up and
have a look at the earbuds themselves
and how the whole thing works so the
first thing we find is a user's manual
though this should be pretty
straightforward shows you how to use the
controls you got volume up volume down
next song previous song pairing and
power on/off play pause phone call
function so that's sort of a
multi-purpose button Karen maintenance
keep dry do not store in a doubt place
or direct sunlight and all kinds of 0
active noise-cancelling is included the
DS that's cool ok let's go ahead and
how on earth is this there we go so you
got your standard IEM sort of thing
going on here where you have sort of
speakers that say like this and then
things that go in your ears like this
see you'll look like this with the mid
do I look styling enough for you guys
thank you well we'll have to sort of do
something about that and then the the
wireless module here so this is a
battery module it is a Bluetooth module
it is a control pod and that's actually
kind of cool so there's your back
forward you're pairing as well as your
power and or rather your power your play
pause pick up calls don't pick up calls
volume up and down and then it just
clips onto stuff that's it's actually
kind of neat maybe I'm just a shut-in
but I've actually never seen sort of
this kind of an implementation before
I'm sure someone's done it before but
you know what it comes down to audio
quality for me so give us a second and
we'll get this fired up now after
spending some time auditioning them the
whole device actually works very very
well so it's really nice to have such a
low profile thing you can just kind of
clip it somewhere clip it here and then
you've got okay don't clip it there clip
it somewhere else tip it somewhere
closer to you so clip it sort of here
and then actually that's sort of awful
but you can clip it somewhere nearby and
then you can run your music off of this
little pod that runs for kind of 10
hours or so sound quality would be what
I would say is kind of consumer grade
lots of bass however the mids and highs
were a little bit on the muddy side
about what I'd expect because that seems
to be what people want these days but
there you go it also includes three
different sizes of rubber pieces for the
iems and I think that pretty much wraps
it up for the ISOs right and the
charging cable as well now let's turn
our attention to the DBS so what do
these have to say for themselves full
range drivers provide exceptional sound
superior designed into your noise
suppression oh yeah the noise
suppression olnees is outstanding
extreme zero loss performance cable
studio lightweight construction and
tangle free nylon cables so they must be
zero loss nylon cables zero loss is
probably kind of a misnomer because
nothing has zero loss go ahead and open
that up and go ahead and open these up I
have no idea where they would have
gotten the idea to style these in red
and black from no idea at all but if
they remind you of anything then it's
probably purely coincidence because
unlike beats by dre earbuds which have
ribbon cables these have nylon cables
okay so that should make them relatively
easy to untangle same thing here where
we've got on actually not that many this
time so oh yeah there they are swear
we've got three different sizes of
rubber bits here so we have a big one a
small one and the medium one ships on
the one that's the right size for me
anyway so I'll go ahead and try these
out and see what are my initial
impressions honestly guys take
everything that I say for the sort of
ignorance that it is because the best
iems that I've ever used our clich s for
eyes and those i really liked so there
you go whoops that was a little loud
okay well these are a lot louder than
the wireless ones i'll give it that but
okay pretty similar overall sound that
doesn't take long to figure it out
there's a lot of bass again a lot of
bass but the mids and the highs are
something where if you're really into
listening to music where the mids and
the highs are more important than the
base so anything that sort of your hip
hop your rap then they might not be
something that you'd be as into so thank
you for checking out my unboxing first
look at the antec mobile products BBS
and ISO headphones you might want to get
in here and have like sort of a close
look at them don't forget to subscribe
