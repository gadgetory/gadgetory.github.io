to convince me to put a TV in the
bedroom so she can watch chick flicks in
bed and I've resisted and resisted and
resisted until finally she made a more
compelling argument well you could game
in bed and I go I could do that couldn't
I so in today's video sponsored by
Samsung we are going to be taking their
6 Series and 650 sound bar along with Oh
check this out they're 65 inch q6f TV
and Xbox one X and this wall mount that
we found buried in our warehouse
somewhere and we are going to be
gamifying my bed I don't have a
controller but if I did this would look
really like gay Marie
so step number one it's gonna be to
rearrange some furniture because as you
can clearly see there is no obvious
place to put a TV here at the foot of
the bed and if we were to put it
somewhere stupid like right in front of
the window well that would be really
stupid for lots of reasons you guys can
think of so I brought I help her
I'm helping Laser James so we need a
plan
well you're the brains of this operation
let's move this stuff okay way to say
this is still full of clothes yeah
oh man looks aren't heavy you like look
at them feel that that's it's not heavy
are we sliding or lift what are we doing
here huh
probably sliding these floors are pretty
old and dinged up anyway yeah see that's
not so bad
what is this thing that is a mirror with
hinges on the side well you could open
them ah okay so that's more like it
and you know what I had actually thought
that the bed might need to shift a
little bit more this way but I'm not
even sure anymore yeah but you're
sitting on your thigh no this is her
side actually oh well whatever
now we could wire up the whole room with
like speaker wire in the walls and
ceilings and stuff but that's a little
bit ridiculous
so that's where the N 650 comes in so
it's got Samsung's acoustic beam
technology which basically gives you
like a panoramic style sound but all out
of one speaker bar it's got eight
speakers each with their own amplifiers
built into the sound bar and it's like a
virtual 5.1 so I mean the ones not
virtual it actually comes with a
wireless subwoofer but we'll get to that
later first we need to figure out where
exactly to put it we have a wall mount
yeah we don't even know if this is gonna
work with the T man it's gonna work it
says up to 65 inches which is what we
have that's like scary when it's up -
yeah we're like we're gonna right there
on the line razor's edge baby it's how
we roll but where are we putting the
sound bar
oh so you can wall note here I was like
hey where are we putting the sound bar
and he goes here
I'm out for the TV it's like well you
can wall mount the soundbar yeah but we
don't have the wall mount kit so we're
gonna put it on a table under the TV
okay easy so this is the part of the
video search for a table well I thought
we were gonna use that table that we
actually just buried behind the other
dressers that we just moved okay that
was our plan and then we did that rows
were smart we need a noise that's not a
noise
that's a nail clipper I see you've
played knife and nail clipper before all
right how you're gonna use that toenail
clipper to cut all the tape I'm gonna
use the file the MacGyver of unboxers
I can emboss with anything oh crap we
opened it wrong I think oh it's one of
those it's one of those ones where
you're supposed to lift it off the top I
always do that yep it is I mean yeah
with the straps already having been
removed so it's pretty easy pretty easy
oh god what was that
ah just crushed the on the joystick for
the OSD right no it seems fine that's
the power button I think you can tell
it's Linus's house because these are
actually two different screws okay
there's a reason for that so tools are
here so I actually kind of think we need
to put the sound bar on the dresser
first and then figure out the TV height
situation all right we're gonna move the
TV cuz I'm actually no oh so I wonder if
we could get over here with like putting
it in here hold on hold on stop the tape
okay I don't say this often but I was
wrong if I wanted truly panoramic sound
the N 650 goes on top of the dresser not
closed in sight but where would you put
all these extra wine hoodies
hey those are my wind hoodies that I
stole he's like a cartoon character
where you open those closet at the same
outfit again and again it's not even a
joke these are just all the same jeans
in various states I think those are
these are the nice ones they haven't got
used yet
people at the office probably think I
just don't wash my clothes and this may
be an element of that okay so it's on by
you turned it off this little overhang
shouldn't be enough to interfere with
any kind of angle drivers or anything
like that for the surround effect so
boom got a game mode we're gonna have to
try that
oh these stretchy Costco jeans all my
knee is bad I can't do that right now
okay
so now we need to actually probably flip
this over so we can have a look at where
the vase amount is good thing we have
these handling strips okay that's for
the vase of mantis should we unbox our
wall-mount I don't have my nail clippers
here a bobby pin Wow is there anything
he can't do there and there this is kind
of curved I wonder if that's gonna have
a big impact huh oh if only if only
James had had the wisdom to consult the
manual as I did we said we're not using
instructions today conveniently he threw
those instructions away right where I
was going
thank you James
okay so then we need a girthy spacer no
sorry
okay what if we just don't use them no I
don't think we're gonna get away with
that just put a bunch of pressure on the
oh it's not curved at all yeah these
aren't gonna reach yeah long ones a lot
in do you have with this we put the TV
on a stand on the dresser since you want
it basically on the dresser anyway
actually that content works
all right should we just go all the way
yeah we are in the bedroom you know
what's really stupid is like our wall
now it didn't work out but this is like
exactly where I wanted to put it anyway
so you want to watch out for this when
you're hooking up a sound bar boom you
want to use that arc connector on both
sides because then you have the audio
return channel so what does that let us
do that lets us use one remote for the
TV and this and also if we hook up our
Xbox through this because this has 4k
pass-through exactly what we're gonna do
then the audio will all go through the
sound bar right yes sir you knew the
answer to that you were just saying that
for the audience right yeah I need
reassurance actually these are things I
read so the way Samsung achieves a
panoramic sound out of this one unit
which of course will work with near any
brand of TV is with these 28 holes on
each end of the sound bar which help the
speaker's on this side act as one beam
ideally then everything will sound like
it's happening right next to you the
sound bar itself is charcoal black with
a brushed metal grill in a sleek look
especially if you have it floating on
your wall since the wireless subwoofer
doesn't add an extra cable
all right King aesthetics over here can
I get some feedback not bad I like the
all matte black look me too I mean we
can power this whole thing up right oh I
guess we could use the remote why are we
why are we being cavemen right now but
can we take off these oh well us are on
there pretty good hey
oh I heard me and now we battle yeah
yeah see this is the first lesson of
sword fighting you just probably strike
at the swords you strike it's a guy so
you gotta actually hit the person hit
his hands
that's how you we got your headshots
today okay so theoretically because
we're using the Audio Return Channel if
I do an audio test on my laptop here it
should play through my sound bar
perfect yes so it's working exactly as
intended there's no reason not to use
this as an extra video input because you
have to tie up one of your HDMI ports on
the back of the TV for arc anyway so you
might as well get that HDMI port back
through the back of the sound bar that
way you still get your full 4 HDMI
inputs I mention that you probably have
morris not to mention that it's easier
to get at the back your sound bar it
probably so wait can we finally listen
to it
oh wait no no we never do this at the
sub-woofer yes yeah it's gonna go right
there totally decided where to put it on
Yvonne's side that way you know the
bed's gonna vibrate a little more do
someone appreciate it what no
that looks stupid yeah but it's in
contact with two surfaces now it's like
actually touching both walls it's not
not a thing no I read that on Xbox
Magazine when I was a kid yeah wait what
if it was siding there was this one
magazine that I used to read for the
articles all the time it told me all
kinds of things about you know what
women look like what they don't
the subwoofer only has to plug into
power there is no connection to the
sound bar itself and there's also no
pairing process for the user it just
connects automatically right out of the
box so I brought this DISA wig and
glasses to simulate evil on experiencing
for this for the first time it's that
mom no is he wearing a silly wig she's
fraught with is so mad I'm dual wielding
remotes here okay sweetie can you go
downstairs please anybody okay thank you
do you want me to carry you down there
okay bug such as the life of the wife of
a youtuber I live with a ghost the
amount of time I spend in a bed with lol
em cheers these are rock they're hurting
me Yvonne doesn't even wear glasses
anymore did you not notice she got a
surgery like six months ago
what okay I just want to go into the
menu of the sound bar you can do that
through the TV can you yes what's
happening on the Xbox I'm not doing
anything all it was me it was the
shoulder button or a trigger button okay
there you just changed that there it's
in the quick so you can go surround game
or standard you don't even have to go
into the whole menu and if you're
playing a game you don't have to go into
the menu at all it will switch to game
mode all on its own whoa that's pretty
granular let's crank the lowest tones ah
that's not the lowest that's the highest
alright
over the suburbs
it actually does vibrate the bed a
little their voices are really clear
you're definitely right about like
slouching more being more natural this
is way better and I'm actually like
right level with the top of the thing if
it wasn't a few inches of hot above it
wouldn't look very good
I continue to be blown away by like how
much sound you can make out of a sound
bar these days should play some games
yeah okay show me this what's that game
called that you're super into it's not
it's not to players what why would you
even bring this up then and that's
awesome for me okay now we should just
stop that's the waste of time no way no
no no I want see how far you can go and
you want to see if you can be being on
my first try because that would be
pretty embarrassing I haven't played
this since grade 10 so it's one stitch
for navigation and another stick for
firing that's it and then there's bombs
which are the trigger and do bombs just
makes me know they clear the whole
screen basically gotcha
you're just showing off now but yeah I
don't even have to move when you die
like when it gets hard to gets hard
though ah okay see you guys
that was death
all right I tried my best I got one
quarter of James's score and that was my
best here we go
let me play a two-player game more like
a fifth but all right no I had 145
tonight I had 36,000 so you said we have
a lot of games on this xbox but do we
like have any that are good
like what's killer instinct that's a
fighting game right yeah let's play
fighting it's like poor man's Mortal
Kombat but get out me killer in seek
pens
I'm rash okay it's rationally good yeah
you know that's a guy from Battletoads
oh wait so these are like characters
from like others no no that's like the
only one oh okay so let's just go
straight heavy kick all the way boom
heavy kick all the way ah dang it
fireball light bolt lightning bolt
Layton ball oh dang it looks like the
cheapest thing ever I look how far away
I what was that okay in my defense
though I won the first round without
that alright come on
yeah you're not gonna be able to snipe
me from there I it did take me three
shots it was pretty bad I should
probably should just noscope do you like
that dang it
did I even hit you oh yeah I got like
half your shield okay I think that's the
best I've done so far I don't know where
I am I never played this game I don't
console FPS when friends do not let
friends console FPS this is ridiculous
man and of course your like screen
peeking me and that's actually doing you
any good because you know the map Oh God
we're both know about of this where are
you
Wow I'm so bad to this awful doesn't it
sucks it you're sorrowful doesn't suck
as much as it did in the first one I
guess well I think we're done here
I've had quite enough of this it is
seven to one it is very clear that my
fortunes will not change but that's okay
I don't feel too bad because I'm the one
