a motherboard by putting a bunch of
flashy lights in my face these days I
haven't even been on the DIY PC scene
that long compared to some folks but I
still feel like at this point I've kind
of seen it all and I've become jaded
enough about these often barely
functional features that all I want is a
motherboard manufacturer to make a
product that is shoes all that nonsense
and gives me a back to basics board that
just plain works no matter what you
throw at it I'm starting to get the
feeling the deep down Asus knows this
because in spite of the fact that they
just launched like a dozen z97
motherboards or something like that they
offered to send me a grand total of one
of them the z97 WS or as I'm calling it
the Linus Edition the CM storm SF 17
uses a massive 18 centimeter fan to cool
your gaming notebook and it adds a four
port USB hub click now to learn more the
ws in the model number stands for
wonderful stability and when a soos it
does build a board in this series on a
given chipset
they only do one because when you trim
the fat and leave only the good stuff
you only need one model it's boring
looking with no LEDs doesn't have any OC
panels carries almost no consumer
friendly features like onboard Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth and lacks some of the really
hardcore overclocking tuning options
that you might find on an ro G Series
board and yet it costs the same as these
feature Laden
you know racecar type options so what
the heck is up with that well the money
that would have been spent in R&amp;amp;D on
features that a small fraction of a
fraction of the user base will use gets
spent on workstation grade componentry
extremely flexible expansion and on
validating WS boards with a huge variety
of hardware that goes beyond the
traditional well it works with AMD
graphics cards an Nvidia graphics card
so I guess it's okay
treatment that many motherboards get
we're talking raid cards high on NIC
cards PCIe storage cards and even much
more obscure stuff than that alright so
what comes with it you get an IO shield
a USB 2 slash firewire pci bracket a
serial pci bracket 8 SE 2 3
six gigabit per second cables two-way
three-way and four-way SLI bridges those
cute connector blocks that make it
easier to plug in your front switches a
manual a driver disk and finally the
motherboard itself now I said already
it's boring looking but I guess now
you guys see my point I prefer the
full-on Borg Azzam look with a black PCB
and just plain silver accents but I
guess if I had to have a gold
motherboard I'll take a practical
looking one like this over a blingy
tacky one like some of the ones I've
seen in the past our feature tour begins
at the CPU socket where we'll find
support for current generation LGA 1150
has well and has well refresh processors
with promises of future Broadwell
support a nice little thing to have in
your pocket
those CPUs all share a common memory
support scheme so to the right of the
socket you'll find four ddr3 memory
slots that run in dual channel mode
power to the CPU and RAM is handled by a
next-generation
all digital power design with eight
phases for the CPU and two for the
memory and it includes some pretty
seriously impressive Japanese capacitors
that are rated at an industry-leading
12,000 hours of operation at 150 degrees
Celsius
well higher than any PC should get on
the top edge we find hardware buttons
for TPU and epu optimizations I
generally don't touch them but if you
want to then TPU boosts CPU performance
a bit and epu reduces power consumption
a little bit next to those switches
we've got a couple more useful switches
the mem ok button boots the PC with
super safe memory settings so even with
finicky run you can get into the BIOS
and make the adjustments you need to and
the XMP switch lets you enable
performance optimized memory profiles
without any software configuration this
could be handy since the board does
support memory speeds up to 30 300
megahertz out of the box
moving down the right-hand side is the
24 pin connector that aside from being
in the correct position on the
right-hand edge as soos claims is
exceptional because it uses a new design
that improves contact with your power
supply connector reducing the risk of
burning output contacts neato under that
are 2 USB 3 front headers for a total of
10 USB 3 ports on the board and then the
dr. power switch that enables OS
monitoring of your power supply to help
you detect a failing unit haven't got a
dead power supply that I feel like
plugging into a working board to test it
but
I guess that's sound pretty cool
continuing on down we've got either
eight say two three six gigabit per
second ports with six of them coming off
of an Intel chipset and two off of a
secondary as media one or four Intel
SATA three ports and two SATA Express
ten gigabit per second ports one powered
off the Intel chipset and one off the as
media chipset this will provide a ton of
expansion options as SATA Express drives
start showing up but it also doesn't end
there there's an m2 slot right next to
them for a total of three SSDs that can
be plugged right into PCI Express rather
than just say that for improved
throughput and latency right on above
the usual contingent of audio firewire
serial USB two TPM and front panel
connector headers are the only necessary
onboard buttons that you might find
useful for testbeds use like power reset
and clear CMOS no you know fancy
esoteric functionality there you'll also
find a four-digit post readout that will
give you useful diagnostic information
but if you can't see it because you know
the numbers move too fast or because
there's a graphics card in the way of
the board and you you know you can't see
it don't worry you can dump the logs
onto a USB drive using the cue code
blogger button right next to the USB
BIOS flash back button on the rear panel
that lets you flash the BIOS without a
CPU installed wicked expansion is
another pillar of WS boards and with
four PCI Express gen3 16x slots that can
simultaneously operate an 8x mode this
iteration doesn't disappoint that means
you can throw for an D or Nvidia
graphics cards in here in SLI or
crossfire for gaming or you can simply
load it up with a bunch of compute cards
for workstation use you can also fill it
up with red Rockets raid cards or
whatever else you want to do because
boards like this are made for future
growth love it just make sure that you
use that six pin auxiliary connector
above the top slot if you want to load
her up so to speak even the fancy 24-pin
connector likely won't save the board
from quad overclocked r9 290 X's if you
don't use that auxiliary connector
finishing up in the corner we find a
quality if unexceptional onboard audio
solution that
uses the realtek ALC 11:50 codec I use a
separate amplifier anyway so this is
more than good enough for my needs but
if you're expecting your motherboard to
drive fancy 300 to 600 ohm impedance
headphones you may want to rethink
something about your setup on the back
of the board we find some good stuff and
actually my first complaint about it
I'll start with the good stuff
2 USB 2 port 6 USB 3 ports dual Intel
Gigabit LAN 7.1 analog audio out with
gold plated connectors eSATA 6 gigabit
per second optical audio 2 DisplayPort
output and an HDMI port now the glaring
omission in what is otherwise a perfect
workstation grade board that mini
DisplayPort connector while it does
enable three concurrent displays it
really should in my mind be a
Thunderbolt 2 port on a board of this
caliber Asus does have their Thunderbolt
header to allow this functionality to be
added with an add-in card but I still
wish it was on board and they weren't
asking me to spend more money and wasted
wasted PCIe slot on it after the fact
well that was it that was my only
complaint aside from the stuff I just
mentioned you've got the usual asus
essentials including they're easy to
navigate UEFI BIOS onboard temperature
probes they're on a magical fan speed
tuning that can create fan speed
profiles with the 6 onboard 3 or 4 pin
fan headers that dynamically adapt to
your system load and finally due to its
build quality and BIOS optimization this
ws board has enough overclocking options
to run with the best of them so it's all
basically there but that's not the focus
here and you won't find marketing blurbs
about that on the box or on the product
page
no well as usual a Seuss's messaging is
a little rough when they try to
emphasize their quality control
standards and compatibility testing the
message still gets through and based on
my experience with their ws class boards
I can't recommend anything more heartily
I still like some flashy lights on my
fans and water cooling tubing or
whatever but when it comes to the
motherboard an often overlooked
component that does so little for
performance these days but so much for
smooth operation I'll take a WS board
any day of the week if I could choose
any board on the market which I can so I
did
thank you for watching my overview of
the z97 ws just like with all of my
videos you can find a link with pricing
and availability that includes my
affiliate code in the video description
under the like share and dislike buttons
which I'd love for you to use
accordingly also in the video
description is a support link where you
can give us a monthly contribution buy a
t-shirt like this one or change your
Amazon bookmarks to ones that include
our affiliate code so we get a small
kickback whenever you buy lozenges or
whatever thank you for watching guys I
hope you enjoyed this video as much as
we enjoyed making it and don't forget to
mash that subscribe button if you
haven't already by the way that bit at
the beginning about how WS stands for
wonderfully stable or whatever I said it
stands for workstation
I was just messing with you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
