sending us here this year check out
youtube.com slash kingston hyperx for
some cool gaming videos also thank you
to Linda calm and phantom glass alright
guys so you've probably seen my review
on spotswood test benches hopefully
somewhere on the screen I'm not entirely
sure before in the past also in my
personal build log update I had a
spotswood test bench there as well but I
did not expect to see them here at PAX
East 2015 and I especially didn't expect
to see them with AI Kia cabinet so
opening with the first drawer in the
cabinet we see a small ITX board
basically little one new blade although
it's not really the same dimensions as
at you but it's similar to a 1u blade
you can fit 80 millimeter fans in here
three and a half inch or two and a half
inch drives you've got to Vandal
switches at the front which you can use
for power and reset or whatever the heck
you want and that's about it you you you
sift the power cables through the back
of the case and if that's not enough for
you moving down opening the bigger
drawer we have a dual matx one so you
can have an MHD x board on each side of
this one and you've got two and a half
inch or three and half inch drives again
you've got much more spots for much
bigger fans so I believe in here he's
fit 3 120 millimeter fans but you could
change the configuration to your liking
I know that fan way up in the front may
not be super effective so you could
remove that maybe put drives up there do
whatever the heck you want extremely
modular what is not pictured here is
another one so he has a five drawer
version or five you version or whatever
the heck you want to call it at this
point which can fit in ATX motherboards
if you want to fit in even larger system
maybe want a full-size power supply as
well you could go with that one but that
being said if you go and say the MHC X
version I decide to not install two
systems you'd be able to install stuff
like a larger power supply or a bigger
graphics card which you might need that
larger power supply for so on and so
forth so as with spots would normally
things are extremely modular and if you
contact him he'll be able to help you
build something to your liking so these
are kind of in the design of maybe a
render farm or a processing farmer a
compute server or something like that
but if you wanted to do something gaming
like he'd probably be able to do
something up for you is
alright guys thank you to hyperx again
