technology and computers around the
world this is obviously not something
that we're going to be able to do all
the time but whenever we kind of travel
somewhere we'll try to pick up another
episode it's largely going to be about
the consumer experience of living there
and shopping for things within the
country this will obviously require
different angles taken for different
various countries like if we did one in
Taiwan it would be much different than
this one which was done in Switzerland
and I believe that is natural so
hopefully you guys find it interesting
and without further ado let's do it
Tunnel bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets use the web as if
you're in 20 different countries learn
more and try to bear for free at the
link in the video description before I
even came to Switzerland it was echoed
over and over and over again by online
when you're looking for computer
components that's all anybody said a
moderator on the forum Alpen Wasser
happens to be from switzerland and he
very specifically was like yeah nobody
buys in stores who just buy online here
and I went on forums local forums to
Switzerland traveler forums for people
that were visiting Switzerland it might
need computer components everybody
saying buy online okay interesting but
I'm stubborn so I want to try a store so
let's check it out and what a store it
was huge we went to Media Markt and this
place was massive at first it seemed
like they'd have everything you could
have wanted peripherals out the but they
had keyboards mice monitors headphones
speakers whatever the heck you wanted
and huge amounts of them on display
ready to use which is super cool it's
kind of a problem in North America as
far as I know at least where I'm from
like people will ask what cherrise which
they should use and they can't go try
any of them or like who what's the
comparison between say a cherry brown
and a roamer gee well at some place like
Media Markt you could actually try that
super cool you can also try all the
mouse headphones whatever it's awesome
even their camera section have like
really high-end nice cameras and studio
lights which is kind of cool to see in a
consumer electronics store but the
computers themselves was a little bit of
a letdown there was kind of a semi small
row of them tucked under some monitors
forgotten in a back corner of the store
and no components to speak of which was
a little rough also the prices at least
compared to North America was a little
brutal but that did seem to be a
consistent theme throughout Switzerland
so I'm not sure if that's necessarily
tied directly into only computer parts
now for buying online Switzerland isn't
actually part of the EU so there's some
import costs and problems there but
you're probably okay there's a website
called top price CH which is actually
freaking awesome there's a huge amount
of online computer part stores in
Switzerland somehow
and you can filter all their prices
through this website and one thing
that's actually really cool about
shopping online is that shipping is
basically free on everything as far as I
could tell not quite everything but the
vast majority of things and a lot of
them depending on where you live are
even available for stuff like one-day
shipping so it's not really that big of
a deal that you can't go to a store to
pick it up if you can just get it that
day anyways now prices are kind of hard
to compare to the brick-and-mortar store
because they didn't actually have the
same things but when comparing other
various things the margin did seem to be
slightly higher for brick-and-mortar
which is kind of expected so that's not
a huge deal and one thing that's really
nice about the top price website is that
well you can do a mass search for a
product and find the cheapest one so
you're probably going to end up getting
a pretty good deal but then again things
are kind of expensive in Switzerland so
it's probably still not going to be
cheap in terms of cell providers we were
there for under a week so we only really
had time to try out one there are two or
three however but I've heard that
they're all kind of somewhat the same in
terms of service providing and cost we
paid 10 Swiss francs and were able to
get coverage for the entire week with
unlimited data and a bunch of other
things included and that's actually
really cheap also it was really easy to
set up the process was quite quick and
it worked in our phones immediately
actually quite satisfied in terms of
that we went everywhere from Geneva to
loose on to Lucerne and a few places in
between and one a little bit further and
yeah coverage everywhere including when
we were hiking out in the hills so I'm
quite satisfied with the self service in
Switzerland dollarshaveclub.com they
deliver shavers right to your door for
about a third of the price of what that
other greedy razor company charges both
my wallet my face finally get some
relief from that old crappy rusty razor
that I used to have way back in the day
joining Dollar Shave Club means that you
get fresh blades whenever you need them
and they feel fantastic and the
smoothest shave ever when you use their
dr. Carver's dollar shave club shave
butter it's not your average shave cream
it has high quality ingredients that
make your skin feel soft smooth and
moisturized your blade will gently slide
across your skin leaving you with
luscious amazing
and touchable cheeks Joe shave comb
slash Linus to sign up in the US Canada
or Australia alright guys thanks for
watching know this is a little bit
different than kind of the standard
stuff we put out there but it's been a
topic that's actually been quite
interesting to us at the office as we
travel around the world checking out the
different ways things are done how hard
or easy it is to buy computers checking
our different tech malls all that kind
of stuff so hopefully you enjoyed it if
you have ideas for different angles that
I could take in the future or honestly
places that I should visit although
we'll probably only go there if there's
a computer show but anyways let me know
in the comments down below or on Twitter
that would be super helpful this kind of
segment is still growing quite a bit so
your feedback is definitely appreciated
