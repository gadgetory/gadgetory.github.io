performs extremely well in both 3d
vision as well as our 3d vision surround
as well as just nvidia surround gaming
so you can see that as you're going
through the corridors and potentially
fighting bad guys I apologize for
playing on easy mode here but it just
makes it a little bit easier to demo but
yeah you can really sort of see the guys
coming up on you from behind so you can
see this guy my left whereas if I only
had one monitor then I would only be
able to see him if he is directly on my
screen so I've got a running in 3d mode
right now which looks exceptional this
game is 3d vision ready so that is
invidious highest rating for well 3d
vision readiness 3d vision performance
there are no problems with this game at
all in terms of performance when you're
running in 3d mode it looks really
really good and honestly it's one of the
one of the better titles out there for
the nvidia 3d vision experience i'm
going to go ahead and turn 3d mode off
though just so you can sort of see a
more sharp image i like how easy it is
to switch between 3d and not 3d you just
press the button on the ir emitter and
it's it's that simple and so now you can
see sort of the whole experience as
you're running down the hallways all the
cutscenes will only show in the regular
wide screen resolution that they're
designed to work in go ahead and do this
turn that off apparently I'm going to
fight some big guy nail and there we go
Wyden's all the way up oh ok so i guess
i do that i haven't played this game in
a while I did need it though but that
was yeah quite a while ago so I'm pretty
sure I know how to beat these guys but
anyway the whole nvidia surround
experience is pretty cool i can see that
guy charging at me from the side even
when i'm not not looking directly at
them although with a guy like that you
probably want to be looking directly out
of regardless ah for the guy at me okay
can I hit him down yeah there we go so
if you were wondering how to beat these
guys in Arkham Asylum I guess this'll la
this will tell you how I think you climb
on their back somehow I'm not sure he's
going to stomp the ground and go away
he's probably going to charge at me
again there we go you get out of the way
so he doesn't hit you ok stomp them a
little bit he's gonna hit the ground ok
anyway so this is really going anywhere
now but thank you for checking out my
video on Batman Arkham Asylum with
nvidia surround and 3d vision that's my
3d vision rig down there by the way got
my two gtx 480 s running on their got a
core i7 875 k pretty sweet little rigged
somehow the guy somehow the guy died
even though i actually wasn't using the
keyboard just now anyway don't forget to
subscribe to my video blog to check out
more videos of this 3d vision surround
