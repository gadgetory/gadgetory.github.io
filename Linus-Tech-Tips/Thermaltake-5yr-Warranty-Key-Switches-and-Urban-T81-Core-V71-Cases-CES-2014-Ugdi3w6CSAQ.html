brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys we're here at
Thermaltake right now and you know me so
the first thing I had to do was stop by
their mechanical keyboards I was
introduced to something interesting
they're going to be releasing their own
switch in the next coming while and as
you can see by the spec sheet there
isn't a ton different that's because
Cherry lost their patent a little while
back and now other people are able to
make those kind of switches but one
thing you will definitely notice is that
big golden badge that says five-year
warranty
that's quite bold and really interesting
and I'm really excited to see what
that's going to do to the market so what
they have here which is what I was
actually first introduced when I came
into the suite is their blind taste test
of keyboard so they've got going on is
their own switch versus a cherry switch
completely on March so you're unsure
which one is which I find that really
cool because I like blind taste test
because it takes away all the other
variables that could affect your results
so I'm not exactly sure which one I
picked but to be honest I've felt cherry
switches that feel these are both blues
I felt cherry switches that feel the
same as both of these before
due to some manufacturing tolerances
that I've noticed we're different years
of cherry switches might feel different
so it's actually quite interesting that
they're doing this test although I'm
just happy that they're doing a
five-year warranty and overall we'll see
where that goes from there on the other
side of the room we have their urban t81
and while this case was described as a
hybrid air-water case my favorite way of
seeing this is just a crazy water build
one see one thing I see a lot with case
guys that want water cooling systems or
they want to be able to strip it down
really easily I've seen a ton of mods
where people are drilling out rivets to
replace those screws so they can tear
stuff down so they can put in more
radiators and in this system I find it
just really really easy and simple to
strip everything out that you don't need
and don't want and fit in a ton of
radiators up in the top here they've got
a really easily removable fan filter
which is great because that's really
easy to take out like I just said and
also clean because that's actually quite
important when you're pulling a crazy
amount of air in through there and then
the top comes off completely you're
probably going to be mounting your
radiator under in the bottom but you can
fit huge massive fans up here in the top
which is great because it's really easy
to set up a push-pull configuration in
this case other than that aesthetically
it looks great with their brushed look
all across it and it has a
or in the front here which I can't
really show too much because of the pool
table but all their i/o and buttons and
stuff are at the top and then the door
hides euro DD slots and all that kind of
stuff because not that many people are
using drive bays like that anymore so
it's actually kind of cool because you
can still access all your buttons
without having the door permanently open
which is great on the other side of the
table we have the core v71
and internally these two cases are
actually quite similar but this one has
some pretty cool drive mounting options
so you can take one of the three and a
half inch drive bay slots and mount it
on the back very quickly and very easily
and it's it's actually kind of sleek
because I like mounting drives on the
back of motherboard trays to get them
out of the front of the case and open up
compatibility with different radiators
and stuff and that's great but a lot of
times you've only fit SSDs back there so
it's quite nice to see a three and a
half inch drive be able to be mounted
back there and two and a half inch
drives thanks to our sponsors NCIX WD
