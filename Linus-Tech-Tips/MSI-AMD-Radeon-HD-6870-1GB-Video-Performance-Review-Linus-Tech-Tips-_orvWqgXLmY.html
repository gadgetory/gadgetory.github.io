incomplete because I'm going to be
uploading some of the segments in
separate videos for example my power
consumption video my heat video as well
as my uh heat yeah he does the same as
temperature so I was going to say
fanboys video those ones are already up
I also have already been working on a
lot of other stuff to do with this card
so you're going to see as many as like
eight to ten videos about the Radeon 68
70 on my two channels but this is meant
to be a general overview of performance
I will have boring graphs but I'm going
to spoil the surprise a little bit the
6870 is not the highest end single GPU
card now the reason for that is not
known to me but for the last few
generations the 3870 the 4870 and the
5870 have been the fastest single GPU
cards from their generations now we've
had dual GPU cards which are faster so
we've got a 38 70 X 2 4870 x2 and 5970
but Andy is changing it with this
generation they're changing the
numbering scheme and they're also
changing the branding so it's kind of an
ATI Radeon graphics we're going to have
AMD Radeon graphics and the numbering is
going to be different so the 6870 is
actually the price point replacement for
a fifty seven seventy so that means that
the 68 70 is actually a little bit
slower than the fifty eight seventy but
that's still impressive because the 68
70 cost a fraction of what the fifty
eight seventy does it performs almost as
well in many applications and when the
tessellation really ramps up for example
in math and benchmark you're going to
find out actually you might not see this
but you'll see that the performance of
the 68 70 is equal to the 58 70 and
though I don't think I have the numbers
in my grasp the minimum frame rate of
the 68 70 is actually much better than
the fifty eight seventy so that's what's
cool about it so with the new price
point the 68 70 is an excellent
replacement for the 5770 as
as you understand where it slots into
the new India lino so that means we're
going to have 6900 series cards that are
single GPU and are faster than the 6800
series so for the cards I tested the
6870 5870 5770 because those are the
cards that in terms of performance it's
very close to and that it's supposed to
replace and then just for some context
on the nvidia side I tested the GTX 460
as well as the GTX 480 because the GTX
460 is a bit of a lower end refresh of a
previous high-end card so it's um
in some ways it's going to be the latest
card from Nvidia even though it's not
the fastest so it should be the most
comparable in terms of the architectural
changes that they've been able to
implement to get the best performance
possible out of it so I used high
graphical settings for all of these
tests that means I'm using anti aliasing
anisotropic filtering and I'm turning
all of the details way up in all of
these games so stay tuned for boring
charts and graphs and then the
conclusion
you
so for the street price this is one
rockin card because we're looking at
about 249 upon release depending which
brand you go with the one featured in my
review today is the MSI radio and 6870
and honestly yeah I just got to say this
thing is if you have 250 dollars you
want to DirectX 11 graphics cards it's
got all the latest features remember
they've updated a lot of things from the
5870 feature wise it's not just a
performance boost this is an HDMI 1.4 a
port that means you've got support for
Blu ray 3d and we're also expecting a
driver update for 3d gaming on this
particular card oK you've got all the
usual stuff which is audio over HDMI
Eyefinity support to a crossfire support
all of that cool stuff except you get
this big tessellation performance
increase you get 3d that is both in
blu-ray and in gaming and because of the
way the inputs rather outputs are spaced
out you get four displays for Eyefinity
so you can actually hook up two displays
to either DVI or HDMI so that's sort of
one group of two displays and then you
can do two displays via the mini
DisplayPort connectors so that's your
clue the fact there's actually five
connectors on the back of this video
card that you can actually hook up more
displays than you could on the last
generation 5870 so you can see they've
change the layout somewhat they replace
that single full-size DisplayPort port
with too many DisplayPort parts if you
want to see the card more up close check
out my unboxing where I really show it
from all the different angles and I
talked a lot more about the features but
I hope you've enjoyed this video review
of the performance of the Radeon 68 70</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
