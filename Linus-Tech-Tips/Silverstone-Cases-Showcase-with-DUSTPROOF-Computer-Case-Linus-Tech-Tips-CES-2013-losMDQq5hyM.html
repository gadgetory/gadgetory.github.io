our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys three cases that are actually
designed around the same chassis in
spite of the fact that they look
completely different from each other in
pretty much every possible way so the
concept with this chassis design was to
take a proven design that that we've
seen from Silverstone's 90-degree
rotated motherboard concept where they
have the where they actually have all
the isle coming out the top and take
that performance that cooling
performance and put it in an upright
design so in this case we have an
inverted motherboard so the i/o is down
at the bottom and the expansion slots
are up here at the top with the power
supply at the top back you are expected
to have your power supply fan facing the
top of the case there's a filtered
intake right here at the back it's got
room for six three and a half inch
drives it's so you know your standard
ATX eight slots so ok ok ok so you don't
see the work that went into it yet but
here at the front so this is the rvo 4
we've got this is the plastic design
case guys these are prototypes so don't
mind the manufacturing sort of anomalies
here so you've got a plastic front with
an open side so this is what makes the
air flow so strong in this case
completely open here it's not as good
for noise cancellation as what you're
about to see with the FTO 4 but it does
give you the airflow you need so here
they've also redesigned the grilles and
I hope I can figure out how to get it
out there we go I'm going to pretend
that's the right way to take it off so
they've redesigned the grilles the older
ones allowed 60% airflow transmission
these newer ones are 90% so that again
is how they are able to achieve that
they've used AP 181 m so these are high
pressure fans and able to create that
positive airflow or positive pressure
inside the case and as well as moving
air through a restrictive grill although
in this case the grill really isn't that
restrictive now we're going to move over
to this guy right here the FTO for takes
everything that's good about the RV o4
and steps it up a huge notch in terms of
the quality so it's using Illuma unibody
aluminum here on the top and here in the
front check this out from the side this
is a single piece of aluminum that's
actually been like I don't even know how
they did this with the folds see this
shape here this is a single piece this
is not a manufacturing trick and it is
not made of plastic
we've also added noise dampening to the
FTO for on all the panels so front top
and side panels and they're using a
higher quality AP 181 fan so instead of
the raven case series cases switches
here where it's got a high in a low
speed setting this one has a dial so you
can take it all the way from 500 RPM to
2,000 RPM to fine tune the case for how
much noise you want to hear versus how
much cooling performance you want to
have the way that they achieve the
airflow that they need in this one is to
have these vents here don't worry I'll
reposition the case to have these vents
at the back so these point to the back
this is also part of what makes this
case more silent because instead of
directing air towards the user sitting
in front of the case rather air rat
noise towards the user it directs the
noise out the back of the case so
there's noise dampening noise dampening
noise redirection but still plenty of
airflow because this is quite open and
free-flowing which leads us to the
internal nickname is apparently the
mammoth this is the MMO one so they took
this case and they went okay we got
these high pressure optimized fans we
got this great cooling performance this
is all really cool and sweet but not
everyone needs that much cooling
performance so why don't we take this
optimized design and turn it into a
total beast that is dust free so yes
this is a dust free case and I'm going
to show you why in just a moment so this
is obviously very early prototype this
is just like basically a hunk of metal
that comes down and reveals your i/o so
you got your USB three your front
buttons all this kind of cool stuff so
I'm going to put that away
this right here is if I can figure out
how it comes out oh there we go check
this out guys
I know right basically they've decided
to put a car air filter into a case now
because they're using a P 182 fans which
as I said before are optimized for
pressure they're still going to be able
to deliver enough airflow to the inside
of the case
to take care of a reasonably sort of mid
to high-end system so no I wouldn't
recommend running for GTX 680 s in here
but running something like a single 680
you're going to be fine so there's those
this is where you see the resemblance to
the other chassis a little bit better
than what you were able to see before
so it's not only dust proof but they're
also saying it is spill proof because of
the fact that the top is one solid piece
and all of the vents on the front and
the back are directed downward so if you
were to spill a cup of coffee on the top
of this case it would all go down it
would get on your carpet but at least it
wouldn't wreck your computer I'm going
to go ahead and I'm going to try and
turn the scram okay we're going to go to
the other side of it so that I can show
you guys what the back looks like so the
back is a very similar design and what
they've done is they've put a space
between the i/o and the back of the
actual enclosure outside where you can
run all of the cables that you need just
like that last thing we're going to
check out in the Silverstone suite is
over here and this is very very cool and
I'm not going to reposition these too
much because then you'll see my entire
production crew through the the mirror
that's behind it actually if you guys
want to move over here a little bit and
you can get an angle that's more like
from that direction so I'll take the mic
and let's go right over here this is a
dual monitor stand that is capable of
360 degree rotation it can move in
pretty much any direction you could
possibly want check this out it is built
out of there you can hear that solid
aluminum and it is extremely robust
feeling so it can take that move it all
the way down here move it all the way
back up here there's no there's no force
required to move it around just like
that we can rotate it as much or as
little as we want to in whatever
direction we want align the monitors
this one right here is a touchscreen and
I am just very very impressed with this
particular product I don't think I've
seen anything
for that allows this degree of
flexibility so there's no pricing
available for this one yet because I'm
sure you guys were going to ask but
remember I don't know I kind of geek out
when I see stuff like this oh yeah I had
forgotten these we're back here so
there's an ITX enclosure this is the mlo
five using an SFX power supply they've
done away with three and a half inch
drives entirely to save on space and it
accepts ITX with low-profile expansion
cards and you got two 80 millimeter fans
over there on the right for cooling the
last case over here on the right so I'm
just going to sneak past you here and
move this monitor out of the way ha so
convenient is the mlo 4 so this is a
continuation in there me low series and
basically it adds a lockable front panel
just gorgeous thick aluminum front panel
- and otherwise sort of very very plain
very elegant looking home theater case
this is the kind of thing we're used to
seeing from Silverstone don't miss any
