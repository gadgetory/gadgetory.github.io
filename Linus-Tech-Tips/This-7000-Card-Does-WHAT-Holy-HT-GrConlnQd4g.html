core i7 extreme edition $1600 2 terabyte
960 Pro nvme drive $1,300 to GTX Titan X
peopie's that we got out $2,400 you add
a hundred and twenty eight gigs of ram
as well as a top-of-the-line motherboard
and yeah that'll be sixty eight hundred
dollars please
now to be clear I'm not complaining this
is a spectacularly first-world problem
but pro video production gear is on a
whole freakin other level let me put it
in perspective
this one PCI Express card costs as much
as all that stuff I just listed combined
all of it this is the Redrock attacks
state of the art creation tool and
simultaneously a relic of a bygone era a
$7000 coprocessor card welcome to holy
cooller masters 25th anniversary edition
cosmos 2 features a unique dual curved
tempered glass side panel check it out
now at the link below ok so as many of
you are probably aware we moved to red
digital cinema cameras earlier this year
in an effort to bump up our production
values and I mean let's be honest we're
enthusiasts give Brandon and Max some
new toys to play with
but have you ever actually tried to work
with red code raw footage before as
Taryn would put it it's a nightmare
at full 8k on a 10 core Extreme Edition
processor with a $5,000 Nvidia Quadro
p6000 graphics card this is what
timeline performance looks like
you see those delays as I'm scrubbing
around and even straight playback
performance is abominable it's not like
it's our 10 gigabit network connection
bottlenecking us either we're nowhere
near saturating it no it's the CPU even
though we're scaling across all 20 of
our threads we are still running out of
processing power and we haven't even
added any lumetri color yet either
that's only gonna make matters worse
throw that into the picture and now we
are dropping about 90% of our frames
while dealing with a quarter to a third
of a second delay when we're trying to
move the playhead around on the timeline
ridiculous and both our CPU and GPU are
basically maxed you actually need to
drop your preview quality all the way
down to 1/8 in order to get what I would
consider to be acceptable performance
with much lower usage true to form
though red digital cinema has a solution
for you are you unhappy with your
editing experience of the footage from
your $50,000 camera
buy this expansion card to
accelerate it available go for 7,000
easy payments of only $1 call now and
we'll throw in this nothing absolutely
free because we're red and in your
wallet is more than just our job it's
our passion but what is this thing what
does it even do well we can figure out a
little bit on our own so there's some
kind of processor here that's under a
hundred and fifty watts of total power
consumption based on the single slaw
cooler and the single six pin power
connector back here there's some memory
on board so we can see those chips
arranged around the chip here and the
dual DisplayPort ports are so it can
actually function as a video output
device though our workload necessitates
a powerful GPU anyway so we won't be
using it that way and the main purpose
of this thing anyway is to accelerate
decoding scaling and debayering
of our 3d files the first two I think
are fairly self-explanatory but the last
one is the process of reconstructing a
full-color image from incomplete color
samples that are captured by the sensor
in a raw recording format but they give
us no actual details about the hardware
other than some nebulous 5x performance
claim relative to their own first
generation red rocket but why would this
older chip based on older process node
technology compared to a GPU running
CUDA be better at any of that stuff
I mean red even supports CUDA
acceleration in their own cine X desktop
application is this thing even relevant
today so with it installed we throw on
the latest drivers and I don't know it's
kind of it's kind of weird
there's no configuration utility or
anything like that but if you go into
device manager it's working properly and
everything seems fine so all that's left
to do then is go
into our video editing software and
press enable so this is the same project
that we were just looking at and we're
gonna change this use rocket drop-down
to all available at full quality my CPU
is still pinned and now I'm seeing 90%
GPU usage even with lumetri color
disabled what ok well now hold on just a
minute here surely there must be
something wrong
let's try disabling the rocket just to
see if we can get back to where we
started well now hold on this doesn't
make sense either with it disabled our
timeline scrubbing looks better than
ever our CPU usage is way down and even
our GPU usage is under control now but
we are still dropping some frames far
fewer though well read only advertises
the rocket X is being capable of
handling up to 6 K footage so maybe what
we're looking at here makes sense if
somehow it's enabled dropping then down
to half quality in the preview window
yields perfect playback without lumetri
color let's check that out
ok and alright turning it on well it
looks like we are still dropping some
frames in that case but that's probably
cause then buy a GPU bottleneck because
you can see our Quadra was sitting at
around 80 to 85% usage so then finally
as a last step we drop down to 1/4
quality and that's looking great
acceptable CPU and GPU usage and a much
nicer looking time line than what we
were able to achieve without the Redrock
attacks
but in a lot of ways this actually
raises a lot more questions than it
answers
why would disabling our add-in card give
me the best possible editing experience
is it just a snake-oil hardware key to
run an improved GPU acceleration
algorithm so I actually spent a couple
of weeks investigating this because
timeline performance has genuinely been
an issue for us but investing in one of
these for each of our editors would be a
whopping thirty five thousand dollars
total and here's what I found
first some backup for what we already
knew without the Redrock attacks red
code raw footage loves CPU cores
knocking my extreme edition down to six
cores yielded dropped frames even at
only one quarter quality but more cores
only carries you so far a twenty two
core Xeon like this costs more
significantly slashes single core
performance and doesn't even approach
the performance improvement from the
Rocket X installed but disabled in
premiere so then the ideal 8k video
editing configuration is a ten core with
a Quadro and a Redrock attacks disabled
right maybe not is the Quadro at over
four times the price really accelerating
this process any better than a high-end
geforce card would we'll be moving to an
HDR workflow sometime in q4 expect an
update on that
so we need 10-bit color over DisplayPort
a traditional Quadro feature but that
was actually added to GeForce a while
back and the results here are
fascinating our Titan X Pascal
despite its nearly identical on paper
specs to our quadrille p6000 is able to
use its sky high nearly 1800 megahertz
boost clocks to reduce GPU usage lower
our dropped frames and even drop CPU
usage a little bit at our target 1/4
playback quality it even almost managed
to pull off half playback quality both
DP use by the way were run with their
power sliders cranked and power saving
mode disabled so then having finished
running all of these numbers I came to
the same conclusion that read support
did get back in give me
premiere is just being premiere disabled
is enabled and enabled is borked and as
for an optimal workstation configuration
well it turns out the rocket X does do
something for users with 8k footage even
though it's not rated for it but for the
difference that it provides I'm not
going to invest that much just to get a
bump in preview quality do you ever find
yourself thinking about the privacy of
your information when you're making
purchases online well privacy calm is a
great way to control and protect your
online spending they offer the ability
to set up virtual burner cards which
allow you to hide sensitive information
and cut off specific points of spending
immediately without interfering with the
places that you make online purchases
two of the best features of privacy comm
are the ability to set charge limits per
transaction per day and per year and you
can close any card with just a click
they've also got their private payments
feature which masks your spending
because it's nobody's business what
you're buying and their browser
extension automatically detects checkout
fields on a web page so with just two
clicks you can create and autofill a
dynamic number into the checkout form so
head over to privacy com forward slash
Linus or click the link in the video
description as a special offer privacy
will be randomly selecting 50 of those
who sign up via privacy comm slash Linus
and crediting 50 bucks to their privacy
comm accounts to spend whenever that's
like a rival 300 Mouse or a cheap
mechanical keyboard for nothing so
