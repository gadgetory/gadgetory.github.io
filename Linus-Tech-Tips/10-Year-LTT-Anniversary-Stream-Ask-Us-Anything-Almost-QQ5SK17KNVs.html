guys do you want to lift it up know that
it's not it's fine cat no you'll be fine
this time I set it to a much less
aggressive encoding settings worsening
it like CPU so we should be fine so
let's start fresh round four fourth
attempt you know it's funny because this
is just such a throwback to the early
days of the channel when like half of
what we did was not edited at all and
the other half of it was edited so
poorly that half of the comments were
about how all the audio was only in one
year or the resolution was set wrong or
there was just like four minutes of
black screen at the end of the video
that was just nothing and there'd be
these comments on the video that would
be like alright I stopped drew the whole
format I think us remember this was
before YouTube there's so many features
we take for granted now this is before
YouTube had like a preview scrub feature
where you could mouse over and see a
preview of what was in the video at that
point so people are just sitting there
for like four minutes of black they're
waiting for like a jump-scare or unlike
hey for those of you who stayed till the
end here's a embargoed product that no
one's seen before right and they're just
like there was nothing yeah I don't
really know how to video at it like
looking back at the last ten years of
YouTube and sort of how much has changed
I was looking at a video that there's a
threat on the forum cuz a lot of people
have been kind of talking about the ten
year anniversary it's not actually today
it was actually sex ride the stream 20
no 26 I think okay yeah I think it was
on the 26 that makes sense cuz then I
went to San Fran was I'm San Fran
yesterday you know what I don't even
know it doesn't it doesn't matter I
think it was 26 but a lot of people been
talking about it so there's a threat on
the forum what's the first line is tech
tips YouTube video you watched and it
was a collab giveaway with Lou from
unbox therapy from like six years ago or
something like that and I watched about
the first 20
I'm like this is so cringe this is
completely unwatchable how did it
anybody like this and the funny thing is
that not relatively speaking not that
many people liked it it only gone you
know 20,000 views which at the time for
us might have been pretty respectable
but there's a lot of stuff that's like
that
on our previous attempt at this dream I
was talking about how I was reading an
article about just sort of looking at
the top 20 top 30 YouTube channels over
the last 10 years and how those rankings
have changed like looking at the pre
music videos era and then the first time
VEVO kind of showed up on the top
youtube channels list and then how
gaming sort of went from machinima like
remember machinima machinima being
basically the sole presence of gaming on
youtube - all of a sudden you know
PewDiePie being the top youtuber a
Minecraft before that you prank videos
reaction videos drama videos like all
these kinds of eras and it's been it's
been really mind-blowing to me that in
spite of like I don't know I have kind
of this I have kind of this forced
humility about my own presence on the
channel and when I say my I should
probably explain why my wife's here on
this dream with me because she's
actually been active in the channel
since pretty much day one not quite day
one technically actually but pretty much
day one of when it wasn't me and one of
the hardware connects guys back at NCIX
who were working on it and so the
purpose of this dream is just kind of to
talk to us about the journey here and in
particular if you want to get any
insight sort of behind the scenes we
left off with a huge cliffhanger of a
question that we are going to come back
to we've just been waiting for me to not
be traveling and not be too tired
frankly we're both kind of too tired
tonight but that's good news for you
because you're probably going to end up
with a lot looser filter anyway it's
kind of what reading through these
articles kind of being me reflects
on my own sort of history on the on the
platform and the sort of forced humility
that I've had because I've got to be one
of the largest YouTube channels that I
we - tech tips has to be one of the
largest YouTube channels that I'm aware
of from a subscriber standpoint from a
total view standpoint from how long it's
been around standpoint that has never
had like a massive viral breakout hit
you know I think seven gamers one CPU
was a sort of a turning point for us but
it was a million views in a day which
even at that time so that was like four
years ago I want to say was not a huge
deal in the context of YouTube as a
whole so we have just quietly kind of
grown slowly but steadily along with the
growth of the channel I actually have no
idea how well you guys are gonna be able
to see this if you will at all so I'm
gonna have to pop up the thing here
oh you guys can kind of see my screen
yeah that's right this is how we're
streaming tonight but like this is our
this is our social blade you can
actually creep vid stats X seems to be
kind of gone now but you can creep
pretty much any YouTube channel only the
really really small ones that haven't
been added to their database don't show
up but you can creep any YouTube channel
like how many subscribers they're
gaining per day how many views they're
getting per day and we've always had
just kind of this slow and steady growth
but some of the spikes you guys might
actually see there are just you know CES
in actually CES 2017 was huge for us we
we uploaded like 50 or 60 videos in a
span of five days like we usually do but
we had quite a few that were that were
really picked up by the algorithm and
performed really well and like all on
the same day so we end up with like this
monster month but
other than that we've never really had a
breakout so we've always been kind of
just kind of in the shadows chugging
away and you know in the last ten years
in spite of the fact that you know I've
never been featured in a YouTube rewind
for example and until the last couple of
years when we've had a freaking awesome
rep with YouTube like mad mad props I
don't think he wants his name public so
I'm not gonna name him or anything but
we've had an awesome YouTube rep who's
really like engaged with us and kind of
cared about us and it's been it's been
really my breath of fresh air you know
other than that we've really just gotten
no attention from the platform
whatsoever and in that time like we've
overtaken channels that were absolutely
you know monstrous at the time that I
first started out like Chris Pirillo and
PC whiz kid were like huge tech channels
back when back when I was first starting
out and you know sort of quietly over
again the last 10 years
- tech tips has 2/3 as many views total
as jenna Marbles who was like number 4
on YouTube or something like that you
know back when - Texas was first
starting to gain some traction so it's
been just an unbelievable experience I
do have a couple super chats coming in
so I should probably have a look at some
of those if you guys have any questions
you don't have to super chat them but it
obviously does kind of help me see them
honestly this is just like we're
chilling with you guys and we're gonna
try and take questions from everywhere
but the chatons so fast the first thing
I wanted to do before we do that though
is come back to the question that we
left off with last time and that was
does Linus Media Group support diversity
in the workplace couldn't help noticing
that you guys are kind of like a tech
bro tech bro culture and for that I'm
gonna kind of let my well HR manager
take over don't look down here
okay well why don't we recap where we
left off so it's not like we haven't
tried to hire females we really did try
for especially for positions that aren't
tech related I mean you guys know that
most of our audience is male so
literally 97 percent over the last month
or so so anytime we get applicants for
any tech related position most of them
really are male so for things like sails
or bookkeeping accounting and camera to
edit and shooting editing we we get more
female applicants and we've actually
hired females for all of those positions
I mean to know those females aren't with
us anymore but that has nothing to do
with we didn't want them here yeah
that's not wanting them here and things
like that it just they didn't work out
for various reasons we can't for obvious
reasons go over that with you guys I
mean I will say that one thing that
we've discovered makes our lives a lot
easier from a production standpoint is
having a passion for tech yeah I mean
I've I've been asked a lot of times over
the years how do I break out as a
youtuber and one of the pieces of advice
that I really like to fall back on if I
can't think of anything unique and funny
or whatever which happens a lot so if I
say this a lot is you have to do
something that you are truly passionate
about because the audience is BS
detector is just too finely tuned if you
don't actually care then it's just not
gonna fly and you can find people who
are passionate about what we do in other
ways like they could be you know
passionate about interpersonal skills or
they could be passionate about you know
filming cinematography or video editing
or whatever the case may be but if
you're not if you don't have at least
kind of a peripheral passion about for
technology it's really hard to enjoy
your work and that's another thing that
I've said a lot over the years in fact
that's something that we've kind of
butted heads about a lot over the years
so for those of you who don't know
Yvonne's background is in pharmacy yeah
so I went to school for five years got
my pharmacy degree came out
became fuzz not working out for you hey
I still work once a month it's true yeah
it's working somewhat but like we would
we would run into situations where
people would be kind of fooling around
or not on tasks or you know whatever and
in her line of work someone not paying
attention for five minutes is could be
deadly literally yes literally life and
death
yeah whereas in our line of work like
I've always kind of made the argument
that like we have some pretty
loosey-goosey policies quite frankly you
you don't have to be on time for work
you're not even you don't even have to
notify unless you're gonna be more than
half an hour late
we don't really taste people about being
on their phones or just kind of going
for a walk or having conversations in
the halls like we're we're pretty we're
pretty lacs about it and the argument
that I've always kind of made in defense
of that goofing around is that as long
as the work gets done and it doesn't
affect other departments adversely we
have certainly crossed that line at
times and obviously we've had to talk to
people about things like we're still
running a company sort of it's funny
some Jake today I made a comment that
the walls were painted like this really
these really pastel bright colors and
feels like a daycare in here and we were
like really does feel like it sometimes
but anyway the point is the argument
that I've always made is that if you're
not having fun when you're creating
content that's the other thing that the
audience picks up on so fast if you
don't actually care and you're not
actually having fun then your passion
and your excitement and your fun are not
gonna bleed into the content okay one
thing that I feel like I had to jump in
with here yes it's like you're making me
seem like such a terrible like
taskmaster yes lady yeah
need I remind you that was your nickname
at your old job literally the boss lady
that was an affectionate nickname the
one you're giving me right now doesn't
sell
I am very affectionate
at the right time I brought that up is
when it's been excessive not when it's
just been like I I in joy getting to
know people at work - it's not like I
and I take longer than 30 minute lunch
breaks all the time I get from the
subhead
so I don't think that's better that is
something we actually had to crack down
on a little bit recently yes setting a
bad example okay well I'm just
explaining that I'm not the bad guy you
make me out to be I only cracked out on
it when I do think it's excessive or
when people are underperforming and that
sometimes does happen and that's one way
to get them to stop underperforming is
to stop wasting time okay so I'm not
being unreasonable I think so this is
what a lot of people probably don't
realize and I know that I don't help
matters so we've we've had some we've
had some very sort of I won't say tense
how about intense we've had some very
intense conversations about you know hey
I couldn't help noticing that when you
announced the Christmas bonus this year
you said I decided I'm gonna do this I'm
doing that yo what it gives like I I
tend to be okay whenever I need another
youtuber I am almost always blown away
by how cut from the same cloth youtubers
tend to be because I don't think you'd
survive as a youtuber without being
tireless without loving the spotlight
without you know being kind of quick on
your feet and and kind of making things
up as you go along and so you know what
I what I have tended to do is be a bit
of a spotlight hog and like it's funny I
mean I had to talk her into doing the
stream with me now four times because
Yvonne tends to be more of of a
background player but
what I think a lot of people haven't
realized over the years like I've seen
comments on our videos that have made me
laugh so hard
mostly inside because I think she'd get
mad if I laughed like that hard of them
okay well I'm pretty sure you oh yeah I
did okay
why did Linus bring his wife torque yeah
and there was this there's this really
great one there's actually quite a
number of them it was on one of the
vlogs where you can tell the company's
going downhill because the boss's wife
isn't weren't barking orders the first
thing I do is hand in my resignation
good know is that I was actually part of
the channel from really really early on
so like filming things in our dining
room or in in my parents in her parents
dining room where I was living
yeah at the time the dining room
specifically and yeah the cameraman
which did refer to one specific person
yeah I was part of the camera people
that did help film so I think it was
what within the first 30 videos I had
already filmed the first one for you yep
I mean I never did that it very early on
I in no particular order the people who
actually operated the camera for Linus
tech tips are there was a guy named
Arthur who did at one point we are you
allowed to be naming these things yeah
it's just the first name Arthur there
was a bloke named Keaton there was the
cameraman who has asked me very nicely
to never reveal his name so I won't be
revealing that one Ivan
shots them at some point I'm pretty sure
one of my colleagues who now works at
Coursera shot something at some point
like it was kind of whoever I could grab
and he'll hold still for long enough to
point a camera at me because I didn't
have a lot of time like I just have
started is like low-budget I remember we
would go you would come home on the
weekends with like a trunk full of
products there'd be like 50 products in
his drone not 50 not 30 30 no we would
spend the entire weekend yeah filming
unboxing after unboxing you're my
parents but it probably felt like 30 but
I think the most I never brought home in
one weekend was around 15 so always yeah
I'm serious I'm serious it just it
probably seemed like more so your way it
worked was I I had a quota and I don't
remember how much I got paid I think it
was like $30 I don't eat all your for
tea five dollars or something whatever
it wasn't a lot so aside from my salary
and then any Commission structures that
I had for my real job which was as a
product manager category manager and
then the PC systems division head so
aside from that I got these like per
video Commission's on both NCIX tech
tips videos and - tech tips videos so I
think NCIX tech tips videos I got paid
about two hundred and fifty dollars in
episode so I like tried my best to hit
my quota for those but it was actually
eight a month and I think four years
I didn't hit it because the cameraman
whose full-time job was very time
consuming and my full-time job which was
very time consuming just made it
impossible those were so much more time
consuming to film and then for every
line expected to do I think it was like
30 bucks or something like that
up to a maximum of 45 videos a month so
the reason there was so much volume and
from time to time you guys would see me
unboxing like swag promotional items
that Intel shipped or like I think one
time I unboxed a game code that was part
of like an Nvidia promotion and then
just like scratch the game code on the
videos when whoever watched first it's
got a free game so I was like I was
spinning that is like hey well we're
promoting our partners like game
promotion thing also I really needed my
30 bucks so there was nothing
interesting in there
so anyway Yvonne's been involved since
really early on and even though she
didn't actually appear on our company
roster on - Media Group calm until she
joined us full-time which was three
years ago when did you join full-time it
was after we moved into the current
studio right I think it was when we
moved into the cuz he's never worked out
of the old house yeah okay
yeah I worked from home and that wasn't
because we had a
baby and I was on Maui or like after my
work at Costco full time and trouble at
the CRA because you were working on your
manliness
well I wouldn't from well hopefully
anyone from the CRA is watching and we
won't have to deal with that that's no
there is nothing wrong with that no I
was yeah so you yeah so I didn't go to
the office because I was dealing with
the newborn and like working in between
and then I was working at Costco
full-time and then working after hours
so there was just no point but I
actually like people who people would
wonder you know why is even allowed to
give orders that - media group and the
reason is that she's been a senior
manager here since day zero she actually
filed all of our incorporation documents
has dealt with all of our accounting
anything that's involved a lawyer
anything that's involved a contractor
it's hilarious because you'll I'll kind
of have these funny experiences where
particularly with contractors and I'm
not trying to generalize but
particularly with contractors Yvonne
will do the initial outreach and they'll
we don't have the last same last name so
there would be no reason for them to
know that we're related in any way but I
think the vibe they get is that she's
kind of like a personal assistant or
secretary or something like that so
she'll do the initial outreach and
they'll walk in the door and you know
you Linus yeah hi nice to meet you
alright so I want to go through the
thing right here and I'm like oh yeah
yeah look I don't know anything about
that I'm gonna have to defer to Yvonne
and they're like well you know I really
need to go through you know some of the
technical aspects yeah yeah I go talk to
her I never deal with that stuff so yeah
like I don't think okay it's hide from
contractors I don't like our accountant
knows you like I don't be he's ever met
you um I don't think the bank knows you
cuz I always deal with them no I don't
think the bank knows me the lawyer the
lawyer knows me the girl lawyer with the
office in downtown Oh
I never was different that was like
time thing yeah okay I signed some
papers
but yeah so Yvonne does all that stuff
she's actually hired about as many
people for - media group as I have she
has kind of done everything set design I
think he's even wrote a script I think
so I don't know I feel weird talking
about myself right now but I know people
ask what I do so I guess I guess we're
being helpful what else I guess I get
projects so nice will be like hey I want
to redecorate the office yeah go do that
or hey I want to build an office that
that's probably a bigger project it's
probably the biggest project you ever
had to take on yeah was building LMG
from scratch oh it was a specific
headquarters yeah it was really funny
because we were working out of the
Langley house which was a residential
house and we had like 10 to 4 against
the bylaws we had the City of Surrey try
to evict us and luckily we had that
other place but construction was going
really slow on it and we'd uh yeah it
was it was really hard it was such a
mess but we made it up yeah and it's
kind of worked out yeah it's getting a
little cramped now but it is getting a
little cramped but we actually have a
plan which has ended up being yet
another project poor Yvonne she's trying
to finish reconciliations for October
the time the date is now almost December
but I actually just dumped two more
crazy projects on her so because we need
some more space we've actually and the
timing worked out really well we've
actually acquired another unit next door
some of you I think noticed over the
last couple of years that all of a
sudden that's like there were those
units that they had and then there was
like this extra space where'd that come
from so we did end up expanding into a
unit next door not actually because we
wanted to what happened was that used to
be owned privately by someone who owns
other property in our complex and
was the ideal neighbor storage of boats
motorcycles cars yeah CEO playground and
he was never in there so we had this
paper-thin drywall wall in between units
one two three four which is us and unit
101 and we were like oh this is great
because no one's ever in there so and to
be clear yeah we needed it to be quiet
for filming purposes ya hear everything
well that's what I was gonna say was
until one day they were in there too
putting in like a temporary mezzanine
yeah which is the mezzanine that you
guys now see in our videos the stairs
that are thankfully there now and our
entire studio is completely unusable
yeah hammering away at things and these
guys are a construction company to be in
there with a forklift all the time like
it would have been a disaster so anyway
they kind of a bend in that project
because they got busy and then
everything was quiet for a bit and
everything was good and then I walked
past it one day and it was up for lease
oh crap
it could be anything it could be a
mechanic it could be uh III don't know
it could be anything and so we were like
okay uh we really don't have the money
for this right now but but we want to
make an apt choice otherwise our units
are completely useless but I also didn't
want to just lease from the guy forever
that would feel pretty stupid so I was
like okay look we need a permanent
solution let's see if they'd be willing
to sell it so we ended up acquiring that
unit in order to just yeah it's it's
extra payments we have to make but that
secured our future basically permanently
because there's eight units per building
we already have these three it's a
concrete wall down the middle of the
building so there's four more over there
and now we've grabbed this one we're all
the way to the ends concrete on one side
nothing on the other side and you have
to worry about noise anymore ever again
yeah theoretically I mean unless we ever
have to move again but we're not moving
okay the one on the other side came up
for sale right around the time that you
know we've been trying to get better at
doing more maker style videos like we're
constantly trying to evolve and I don't
think we're ever going to be
Adam Savage like it's just it's not in
the cards but we can still we can still
acknowledge that maker community without
without being that hardcore but we what
we need decent tools otherwise it's
going to be sketchy heatsinks forever so
we were looking at building a workshop
in 101 yeah and what we realized is it
wasn't gonna fly yeah so for again noise
purposes and the other safety safety
actually because people are always going
back and forth and if you're gonna have
a proper workshop with a laser cutter
and things like that you really can't
say Alex want to leave yeah like a metal
lathe you can't have people just rocking
back and forth it was also our storage
area so so people would be yeah there
all the time
yeah so we were like okay oh wow
unit 105 is available what if we put the
workshop in there on the other side of a
concrete barrier cuz that was another
big concern even the editors were
complaining when the CNC was running
yeah and that they weren't trying to
film anything so so we've expanded our
space and so the latest project for
Yvonne has been acquire that space build
a workshop fortunately she's got a few
months for that and in the meantime
build an epic employee lounge in 101 so
I think you're gonna have a what I think
there's a 12 gaming station Lynn yeah 12
seat like land center which we talked
about in a previous video but we've
expanded the plan because what we
realized was like that's gonna be lame
just like sitting out in a warehouse
playing video games like yeah we can do
that here so what else we're gonna have
so I think jig said there was an 85 inch
day to an 82 inch TV which is I I don't
even know where to start we're gonna
figure this out Jake and I went couch
shopping today so that was pretty I do
like big comfy couches all around it we
got flooring already which was super
cheap and nice good I feel good about
getting good deals that's what matters
to me I have to get a good deal not a
trained accounting but for better or for
worse a professional accountant for the
last six years so and and the accounting
firm that we hired to look through our
books
said they would hire her so the first
one that we went to first one yeah that
made me feel pretty good we day that
good though I don't know what you are
you guys anyway but anyway so we're also
gonna have a tabletop gaming section
that's just gonna be like kind of a nice
dining room table some chairs we're
gonna put the arcade in there so
hopefully some will finally use it
ping-pong table we're gonna have a
bigger kitchen area because the one
right now is literally it fits a
microwave and a dish back and that's
pretty much it I mean it's not gonna be
a full kitchen because we'd have to pull
a permit if we were gonna do like an
actual sink and running air and all that
kind of thing so it's just gonna be kind
of a microwave and a countertop that's
still it's still gates enough for your
popcorn we're gonna have a mini fridge
yeah
popcorn drinks yep things like that that
kind of thing should be all good so
that's Yvonne's latest project so that's
gonna be pretty fun and now maybe we
could actually start to take some of
your questions Logan says once the next
crack your dwarfs love you guys it's not
in the plan right now you've tried to do
scrapyard wars once every quarter so
once every three months but I think it
happens more like once every six months
yeah I think it's gonna be probably a
year in between the last one and by the
time we finally get to it again now the
reality of it is scrapyard wars is
extremely taxing on the entire team yeah
even the people who aren't directly
involved in it get just screwed because
their entire workflow gets messed up by
half of the company being out of the
office filming something for an entire
week and the thing about scrapyard wars
is this is such a big risk every time
what if this is the season that no one
actually builds a computer what if it's
boring and you know it felt like there
we got a lot of feedback last time
around that maybe the concept was kind
of played out
with that said though those of you who
are following on floatplane are probably
already aware of this but we have a new
kind of proposed totally different but
we hope equally exciting multi-part
serialized format coming it's going to
start it today right on flow plan yeah
I'm actually really excited to watch it
I was hearing people in the office
talking about Alex and Anthony
unbeknownst to each other we're sitting
basically back-to-back having just sat
down with their lunches and they were
watching almost the exact same part of
the video just like had their popcorn
ready the first episode is about 20 to
23 minutes long and it's gonna be called
secret shopper so we realize that a lot
of the time because of our profile we
might get special treatment from
manufacturers and so what we wanted to
do was go undercover and look at PC
builders that's so this is the first the
first run here is going to be system
integrators and see exactly what the
experience is like start-to-finish
bonynge a custom-built PC or a pre-built
PC and there's I don't want to spoil too
much but there is some epic stuff that
goes down I'm not going to name names
but at least one representative claimed
to us that we could get a ten times
performance increase by going from a
standard SKU to a k' overclockable SKU
of the same model number or like 3% okay
you know not ten times so that's gonna
be pretty good ah no man says can you do
a GPU giveaway we actually have a GPU
giveaway running right now on our forum
for folding at home so go check that out
will says thank you for the best content
on YouTube thank you I really don't know
for the best content on YouTube you know
mr. beast saying cutie pie over and over
again for ten hours that has got to be
in the running
setting a hundred thousand times I
didn't actually watch the video because
I feel like I could kind of have the
experience from looking at the thumbnail
looking at the length of the video -
navigating somewhere else but it's gonna
be right up there sir cloud says how has
the last ten years affected LG for the
future well it's funny because when we
started LMG your goal was be a real
company and I think that we've we hadn't
really started to do that the sort of
the dream was five to six people within
five years making enough money that they
can sustain themselves we never imagined
anything like this yeah hi so I think
we're up to 21 people now at LNG an lmg
if you don't count flow plane people and
I think there's five people at flow 25
people of flow plane so it's it's great
and I like to think that people at LNG
like lists people that work there get
paid really well um they're buying homes
which is amazing to see they're buying
nice cars nicer than to be clear the
ones that stick with it yeah and the
ones that laughs the ones that prove
they're proof they're worth it or what's
that called earn their stripes there we
go
yep so we've it's funny there's been a
lot of people I've seen a lot of talk
outside sort of around the web about how
- Media Group expects slave wages and
we'll see a lot of comments whenever we
post a video looking for applicants
whether it's a call for writers call for
programmers whatever else there's a
whole lot of comments with people
definitively as though they've worked
here or something you know stating as
though it's fact that - Media Group
expects you know endless over time and
for slave wages and the reality of it is
our turnover like in the total time
we've existed as a company is I think
just over 10% and we have been around
for six years wrap your head around that
once people get in at lmg they do not go
anywhere and I'm gonna cop to it
starting wages very low but it's one of
the it's one of the few things that I
took away from NCIX that or from my time
at NCIX because not all this was
necessarily NCIX philosophy but one of
the things I took away from my time at
NCIX
is that you should hire the team of
people that are really excited to work
with each other every day to the point
where it's not about the money they'd
rather just do what they do and love
what they do and love the people that
they work with and genuinely enjoy
getting up and driving to work
and then from there if you have an
amazing world-class team of people who
are passionate like that the business
will thrive and when the business
thrives well then the reward will come
that's always been the philosophy as for
how the last 10 years has affected LMG
for the future I guess the point we were
trying to make was we had so little idea
where we were headed and honestly the
whole thing was crazy yeah we were we
were talking in the last room about how
yeah ever ed and I were guessing how
many subscribers we had when we first
branched off into it's not like into LNG
its own company yeah and it had guests
around a million I had yesterday on five
hundred thousand and we started with 150
I was both so it was about two hundred
thousand by the time - media group was
actually incorporated and started its
first day of business but when we made
the decision when the decision is
actually made it was probably closer to
a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty
thousand subscribers looking back on
that that is crazy I don't know what we
know I look at I look at channels with
like a couple hundred thousand
subscribers and I go yeah you know
you're you're on your way but like you
know we hit that million mark and then
you can let go nd you can make it your
full-time job like excited for you like
make it happen and meanwhile we were
absolutely nuts because not only did we
go indie at 200,000 I had a six month
old baby that I was leaving a good job
before like I was making well over six
figures at my job I was pretty high up
in the company so I was leaving this job
which I got a lot of support like can't
be can't be grateful enough for that but
I was leaving this job we had this six
month old baby we expected to start the
company with two full-time employees
yeah plus myself right out of the gate
Luka Ned because I didn't know how to
edit video and Luke was running the
forum which he wasn't on camera yet at
this point remember so he was running
the forum and he was also doing like
prep for the videos because I didn't
have time to prepare everything I had
this crazy harebrained scheme work out
and I worked out of my head where we
were gonna work with technology
companies like NCIX we were gonna do is
just do unboxings we were gonna do
a week's worth of unboxing videos for
the tech channel in one day then the
next day we were going to work with like
local car dealerships and we were gonna
do like car unboxings just like
overviews and we were gonna stoop like
five of those six of those and you
wanted a we're gonna do like tools this
other day toys this other day and we
were gonna run all these like low
production value kind of cheap Oh
Clinton we were gonna put up like 50 to
70 videos a week because but this is
like the three of us like it was just
stupid like I don't know what I was
thinking and and we and so like I need
but I needed these people I couldn't
survive without them because I didn't
know how to shoot her at it and I didn't
know how to well I just needed Luke for
like the forum stuff that he did any
development stuff that he did and and
prep and so also means Ivonne for
organization and accounting and keeping
me grounded and yeah I don't know where
I'm going with this anymore but it was
not it was stupid it goes basically
right we had no idea what we were doing
then we probably have no idea what we're
doing now and we're getting to the point
where lmg honestly is developing kind of
a heart beat of its own like I kind of
found out that we are up there are
apparently internal proposals that exist
and there are brands looking to work
with us in like more of an agency role
and I was like oh yeah that kind of
makes sense cuz we kind of nothing
against any of the agencies we work with
some of them are awesome but well we
just we do some of that for ourselves
yes so we're experienced when we do a
lot of our own agency work and quite
frankly we do a good job it's not that
complicated prompt communication deliver
what you said you were going to deliver
clear communication you know we bring
your a ideas to to the client and you
know work with them to achieve both
their goals and yours and make it work
for the audience I got like all that
kind of stuff and I was like okay yeah I
guess that kind of makes sense we'll
probably need to hire like a half a
dozen people if this takes off what the
hell
thank you so I don't know
to be clear we don't know if we're gonna
do that yeah yeah still how I'm thinking
about it we're not ready to announce who
it's with yet but LTX this year is going
to be in partnership with a major live
event partner like you guys are going to
know who this is they're gonna be like
no way it's gonna be really awesome this
year we're actually taking it like way
way way we're way up into the big
leagues hopefully yeah like the venue I
think is something like double the size
of last year it's in Vancouver proper
yeah Vancouver Convention Center looks
like it's pretty much locked down like
we are we are kicking it up a handful of
notches trying to really do it this year
and like that you gotta remember there's
entire companies who and whose entire
business is one or maybe two events that
they host once a year or twice a year
and and all of this is kind of like
happening with actually very little
guidance from from my hand anyway I know
Yvonne's been involved with it but
alright so yeah we don't know there
that's know but I think what we do know
is that it's it's really become a real
company yeah yeah with like paper towel
dispensers that go like this you know in
the bathrooms and some well no seriously
like you don't have a way to dry your
hands for the first three Oh like you
just kind of wipe them on your shirt or
your pants like I bet if you guys go
back and look at videos there's gonna be
like water marks on my shirt I'm like
yeah is that even when you become a real
company you have those paper towel
dispensers and things like that people
still go take a shower in the office
come out shake themselves off and
there's literally like Waterston
Waterston the wall there's just like
just like shook their hands off against
the wall
hence the day care comment uh-uh
Aditya thank you Jamie Dunn says lines
perfect timing was just tuning my PC
watching your videos in the process
you're amazing love your videos thank
you Jimmy KITT caffeine TV isn't this
leggy okay oh isn't this leggy speaking

it's gonna be I think Saturday night
adnan hi thanks Aaron Cummings hi thanks
Joshua hi thanks Trevor hi thanks Troy
Williams hi thanks apparently I've been
an inspiration hey its mate thanks mate
you know you don't have to send money
dude here you're awesome maybe super
chatted us bought us a cake today that
was really nice that was really nice too
celebrating everyone's getting into the
you know we have wanted to do like a
10-year anniversary product like like a
keyboard or something like that but we
just couldn't get our act together in
time and honestly I kind of like this
better just keeping it low-key but our
community has really like made a lot of
noise about it and it's been it's been
really cool yeah you guys are amazing
yeah none of this exists without you
guys six says always fun to have
Canadian content on YouTube we take so
much flack for being bad Canadians cuz
we always talk in like us pricing I'm
sorry fellow Canadians but like here's
the thing okay our audience is
predominantly us sort of it's us the US
has a greater share of the name one else
but there's other regions that are
catching up a big time Australia UK
India is making a significant ground
right now which is really cool
anyway the u.s. still takes the biggest
chunk and here's what you got to
remember the pricing in other regions is
often derived from the US pricing in
particular Canada so we're giving you
Canadian pricing ish you just got to
kind of go Times 1.33 ish in your head
except it doesn't always work out that
way because sometimes we're talking
about like promote promos and stuff ah
Mahesh says thank you for 10 years
inspired me to become an Intel engineer
so you already you know more about tech
than I ever will I can pretty much
guarantee that was pretty cool dude I
love hearing those stories like when
watching our videos people get inspired
to go way deeper than I ever could
that's incredible Rishi says could you
tell tell us something that changed you
significantly during the past 10 years
Wow how about you do you want to go on
this one um well I mean there's the
obvious starting LMG has changed this
significantly over the last 10 years I
feel like I've aged way more in the last
10 years having kids yep
it's crazy to me that we're still the
only people in oMG who have kids
well a lot of people that are younger
than us they are younger but we had kids
already we also have kids we had kids a
lot sooner than most people nowadays had
kids I think what I was 24 yeah most
people are in there like late 20s early
30s so funny so between her being 24 and
being Asian which means that like as far
as I can tell Asian girls turned 17 and
then turn 65 so there's kind of like
this look it's it's it's it can't be
racist if it's true right so anyway
between her being 24 and being Asian she
would go to like the baby time classes
you know rec center yeah library or
whatever and all the moms would look at
me really really weird like like pity or
like judgy ears like yo look you know
the rings on the finger okay
also I'm 24 like this is not a big deal
it's actually like prime prime birthing
years you know biologically so no I
don't think you've ever done that in
your life it's like it's so funny to
think is like even though the social
norm at least here in Western Canada
anyway has been to have kids older you
know biologically it's actually more
difficult on your body the older you get
and I remember one of the funniest
things that her OBGYN said during was
this pregnancy number two q so you're 26
yeah at this point and turning 20 26 27
somewhere in that range anyway
she goes yeah this one's like way more
difficult I'm getting more sciatica
pains and just I feel my fatigue it's
harder any kind of a nice clipboard or
whatever he's like yeah well you know
you're no spring chicken so it's to be
expected
excuse me he was awesome yeah I loved
him yeah just totally to the point yeah
we're all about just straight talk
communication you know if if it's hard
because we're old then we want to know
yeah that was actually one of the
questions from the last stream to is how
are what was it was it our communication
or a relationship has been starting a
company together yeah there have been
times okay look there's been tears yeah
no doubt it's been a lot of stress it's
been a lot of fun a lot of stress
there's been there's been fights yeah
obviously you know making hard decisions
you know particularly when it comes to
HR because there's a relationship
component to it making hard decisions
with respect to money like we were very
close to running out of money in the
first six months like I forgot how close
it was yeah until I was thinking yeah
two hundred thousand subscribers like I
was looking back at the kind of adsense
numbers we did at that point I was like
holy crap we had no money
there was nothing it was hard and you
know that's actually that was one of the
things that I'm gonna totally derail
this but that was one of the things that
really made me reflect on the community
again I still remember the first time we
uploaded a pre-roll like a baked in
pre-roll on one of our videos aside from
just YouTube ads that ran against them
we actually uploaded it as a dedicated
video because I don't know how had felt
about it but I was pretty proud proud of
the animation job he'd done on this like
intel snowboard campaign or whatever it
was was weird campaign and the video was
basically like look these are coming
we're gonna try our best to make them
you know have a tuning yeah and good
production values and be entertaining
but like we need to eat and that was
what it was about at that point and the
vast majority of the feedback we got
from our community was actually positive
and I kind of like Wow thank you because
you know that was a very fragile moment
for us where if we hadn't been allowed
to diversify our revenue streams we
might not have made it I might have had
to go crawling back to NCIX and we all
know how that would have
right well they didn't survive we have
outlived my previous employer which you
know I'm sad about a lot of aspects of
that there are some great good people
who worked at NCIX who lost their jobs
because of frankly mismanagement but
there's also a certain sense of pride
that I and everyone that I managed to
pull out with a fire with me I'm doing
better than ever before
oh boy do you want to go back to the
previous word I knew when I keep going
and just answer some of these yeah go
back to the previous one turist um so
actually I'd say that it's made our
relationship a lot better like it's
forced us to talk about a lot of things
and be on the same page because if we're
not then how is that 20 other people
supposed to be on the same page as us
and it's made this groats made us grow
together
like it's easy I think too it's when you
divide and conquer your tasks as a
couple and you know far be it yeah you
don't have to take my relationship
advice I'm not some kind of relationship
guru or anything but I think when you it
was actually one of my ex-girlfriends
parents that was really inspirational to
me in this way I remember having a
conversation with her that was like her
parents didn't want to come get us from
somewhere because it was a real hassle
because her mom was in the middle of
something and I was just like why is
this a big deal like your dad's not
doing anything why doesn't he just come
get us and she can stay at home and
she's just like oh well they don't do
that I was like oh oh yeah I don't think
I've ever seen them not just like when
they have to go out and run an errand
together they just go and do it together
and I was like that's really cool to be
married for 40 plus years or whatever
and still crave each other's company to
that degree and I don't think something
like that happens by accident I think
you grow together
and there's a temptation to divide and
conquer like there are times when Yvonne
will go out and do the shopping and I'll
stay at home and
I do things hey you gave me crap last
weekend but I had cleaned the kitchen
even if you couldn't tell so my fault it
was so messy that she couldn't tell it
had been cleaned up she's cooking anyway
the point is there's a temptation to
divide and conquer and sometimes we
split up but there's also an incredible
value to just tackling problems or
hobbies or challenges together and so
we're we really had a turning point was
when we went from we can't be spending
so much time on work it feels like
everything we do is work - okay we need
to start treating work as like this epic
hobby slash adventure slash surrogate
social life for better or for worse
slash all these other sort of more
positive ways that we can look at it
because there is a lot of positive there
even if it would be so easy to dismiss
it as work we have the coolest jobs in
the world and we are so lucky and we
work with the coolest people in the
world my team is see I did it again my
team our team our team is hands-down
world-class absolutely world-class and
one of the best things I ever heard was
from a review last year where somebody
said that at their old job there was
always or at their previous jobs not
just their old one there was always this
one guy absolutely hated but at lmg
could literally sit down and have a beer
with anyone because they're just awesome
and we take a lot of pride in that
TK says buy some v bucks for your wife
what Hervey bucks I don't know okay I
feel old right now
right Troy says you've inspired me to
learn and research more about tech happy
to hear that Mapes sent more money what
are you doing dude uh Jeff go crazy
we're watching you guys grow for the
last decade - the only man that looks
fourteen years old
acts ten years old the aches moans and
groans like a 60 year old I was born old
man like straight up I was born an old
man
Guddu says congrats from india and you
live in Richmond or Surrey so we live
out
I don't know how specific I want to get
about it but we don't live in Richmond
thanks Paul
thanks other Ben Cloverdale thanks tough
thanks Casals thanks Finn
Amy where do you hope to be in the next
five years it's so tempting to say like
on a beach like I don't think that
sipping coconut won't juice whatever
butterflies would actually like that I
think it's an honor style yeah you like
to be really hands-on be involved and so
do I I joke about it so much with my
team like I walked into our Monday
morning meeting I think two weeks ago it
was like okay so first order of business
everyone's laid off we're shutting it
down I've made enough money see ya and
no one even like blinked because they
just like you I am whatever he does this
all the time and like I always talk
about like these pipe dreams that I have
like I just want to like drive a school
bus or flip burgers and I just want to
have like all these crappy jobs because
I haven't had a lot of jobs actually I
was a lifeguard and then I painted
houses and then I worked at NCIX where I
actually did a number of different jobs
but I worked for the same company and
then Linus media group like that's all I
did I never worked fast-food I never
okay I worked retail but only for six
months and NCIX like I didn't work and
honestly it was hardly work like I
applied there because I spent so much
time on their forum advising people
about what computers to buy I figured I
might as well stand in their store into
it and get paid but like like a child
these things I'm gonna like work on a
road crew and like you know people are
gonna come and be like hey we do like
famous on the Internet at one point
without nah man don't know you talking
about you and I talk about this stuff
all the time but I don't think I don't
know and like you know for being
completely honest like I'm not at a
stage where I have to go this hard
anymore so I guess that would be the one
thing I'd love to see over the next five
years is for us to have more
life balance especially with three young
kids like we're never gonna get to enjoy
the stage of their life in again yeah so
that's something I really like to see
meanwhile you're streaming with me yeah
well this is fun too you have to think
of this as our hobby yeah we tackle
together this was this was my spin this
was actually when I finally finally won
the like look- media group really needs
our attention to survive and it's not a
bad thing
Sebastian just want to try this feature
paid two bucks to try the future thanks
tough red gamer Daniel what would it
take to have my six-year-old daughter
meet you next time you're in San Fran oh
man I just honestly I just don't know
how to manage something like that for
context yes blue to San Fran so he left
Tuesday night I think you took the
arrived and I left the office at 5:20 to
get to the airport get to the airport
flight was that what like it was delayed
8:30 anyway the point was he landed
around 11:00 right 11:30 11:30
okay so filmed all day to the next day
yeah I think what time did you finish
filming well we finished filming at
around 4:45 4:45 what time do you drive
to the airport five o'clock o'clock for
a 7:00 7:15 flight and then I was back
on my doorstep 29 hours after I would
have left it yeah and that's the way
that I do things not because it's
pleasant but because it means that I get
more time with my family it means that I
get to spend more time with my team
helping them making sure that the
content is as good as it can be I get
more time with my kids like I would love
I have never seen the Golden Gate Bridge
I have been to San Francisco over a
dozen times for sure probably over 20
times and I have yet to actually see the
Golden Gate Bridge yeah oh end a I think
I like saw it at night or something at
one point but I'd like couldn't really
see it
so sorry Daniel it's just it's not
really my style we do LTX once a year
and that's army done that's the best I
can really offer and we've had young
kids come aboard and they've had a great
time so yeah don't be shy
thanks Matthew thanks rampage deluxe
thanks subhan Andrew and she says where
is Luke Luke wazzup flute playing media
he's doing fine Denholm says hi from
Australia yo dude Yvonne are you loving
the other side dragon no I know like
what are we gonna do with it so I
noticed that I want to have a smile and
Center okay yeah that's what you told me
you were gonna do and then in Jake's
mock-up of the land center it's not in
there I'm gonna put in me okay he told
me that it's going to be tucked under
the stairs oh oh yeah oh yeah there well
I'm gonna let you guys fight that one
out ah Dave what are your strategies for
keeping creatives on task in producing
make sure okay so this is actually
something that's been really challenging
over the years never let it get boring
creatives are really hard to manage no
offense to my team love my team I might
need to remove this world class but
creatives are alike
you know I kind of separate people into
two groups
you've got your geniuses and then you've
got your others I have a word I use but
I'm not gonna use it it's rude
so you've got your geniuses and then
you've got everyone else and the way
that I see it genius doesn't mean IQ
over a hundred and forty or whatever it
is that doesn't matter that's not the
point
geniuses can think for themselves they
can problem solve they can they can
innovate they can identify a gap and
they can fill it they can come up with
new ideas everyone else just kind of
does whatever you tell them until you
tell them to stop and of course you'll
have varying levels of focus in either
of these groups but the good thing about
geniuses is that they come up with new
ideas they keep the content fresh I
don't think it's an accident that Linus
media
group quarter-over-quarter has never
gone down in viewership not once we've
been told many times your videos suck
now unsubscribing this is why - tech
tips is going downhill because of this
video - tech tips has literally never
gone downhill so I can kind of let those
kinds of comments roll off my back
pretty easily sometimes I mean it's not
like you don't read some of the comments
and tweak things quite sure we take
feedback yeah but I don't let hate get
to me because numbers don't lie
anyway a big part of why we've been able
to sustain that kind of growth has been
that we hire creatives we hire geniuses
we hire people who can bring their own
fresh perspectives their own fresh jokes
their own ideas their own expertise and
we let them contribute it of course in a
controlled and like harnessed manner
like we can't let people just go off the
rails and start wearing dinosaur suits
all the time and jumping out at cars or
whatever the thing that was actually
happened and happened I did not approve
anyway you can't let people go off the
rails but you got a you got to harness
that energy right and so the thing about
creatives is that they're geniuses but
they are more difficult to manage and to
get bored really fast and so you can't
just take Alex I'm gonna use Alex as an
example me to pick on Alex so I could
have Alex pump out something to them to
the tune of three to four laptop reviews
per week because really you can kind of
run them in parallel there's only a
handful of things about a laptop review
that are subjective you got kind of your
keyboard and your touchpad and like sort
of the fit and finish and then like that
kind of stuff but other than that you
benchmark it you check the thermals you
check the battery life you open it up
you see how upgradeable it is like it's
kind of assembly line but even at times
when we're kind of like we really need a
video and then a laptop on the shelf I
have to kind of step back and go okay
hold on a second how hard am i pushing
him right now to crank out
assembly-line content no i need to
assign him something that really lets
them flex his muscles even if it is a
terrible investment from like how much
it costs me to pay him to work on it how
much it cost me to pay a shooter to
stand there for three days while he
works on it how much it cost me to have
an editor go through all that bloody
footage and how few people are gonna
watch the damn thing but you have to let
people flex their creative muscles and
you will find that the productivity
stays higher of course yes still have to
have conversations like yo your comment
on your phone and I couldn't help
noticing that you actually didn't
contribute any posts to the company
Twitter last week so you're probably not
working on that you should probably put
your phone away
like maybe clean up some gear or
something you know obviously you have to
do that but I find letting people try
things I mean I have greenlit so many
projects that I think are outright bad
ideas but and some of them I've been
totally right and other times I've been
wrong and that's where other people get
fulfilment from their jobs is when they
get to be creative and they get to see
it work and they get to prove their boss
wrong seriously job satisfaction what
would you rather I think about it really
think about it would you rather like a
10% pay increase or would you rather
have the satisfaction of proving your
boss wrong on a regular basis be pretty
fun in front of everyone in front of
hundreds of thousands of people okay and
I think that keeps our audience from
getting bored too because we're always
trying new things Erin Lee visit
Australia's and I'd love to I have never
been to Australia I don't know how that
is but it has never managed to happen
Joey says huge thanks for the videos
they really drove me to IT and I've been
assistant min same company for five
years
wow that's incredible smokey says
Congrats Thank You smokey little Aiden
Thank You juicebox Thank You Thom this
way plays Thank You God's law says I
actually think I recognize that username
thanks for the content watched you since
the NCIX days Jackson - you still use an
app watch I was wearing the Apple watch
just as like a tone
I hadn't Android phone in my pocket for
like weeks right now I'm actually not
wearing one because I don't know where
my galaxy watches I don't even know if
I'm gonna review it after all I really
wanted to it looked so promising I'm
just so frustrated by it like I was I
was I had I was like I was eating a
burrito or something so I had like
burrito sauce all over one of my hands
and then I was like holding a book in my
other hand or like a phone or something
and my watch buzzed and I was like okay
this is an email from someone no idea if
it's important no way to interact with
no way to get this information without
touching a touchscreen how do the smart
watchmakers fail so badly pebble had
this figured out half a decade ago the
point of a SmartWatch is that my hands
don't need to be involved I need to get
the crucial information that tells me do
I need to take out my phone without my
hands anyway super brawler thank you
spicy Thank You Yvonne will you ever do
reviews no I don't think so right cut oh
no I actually wrote one review for it
was the hardware connects that in one
case I wrote down review a really long
time ago I don't even know if it's still
up
I loved that case I actually gave it
away though I kind of wish I hadn't
because now we have a girl and I bet she
loved it um do you want to show them
what it looks like I don't think the
pictures are even still on the hosting
service okay but have likes weird about
Swarovski crystals or ski crystals and
they had like really pretty painted
flowers and the case was pearly way like
it was just cute cute but yeah I helped
her with some parts of it but here are
the external impressions I'm pretty sure
your exterior impressions I can I can
read off oh no please don't people will
go find it themselves the first thing I
noticed about the metallic gray case was
the fact that was actually more white
than gray it has a beautiful white matte
finish
that appear shiny and reflects light
from every angle well they don't look
like much in the pictures the Swarovski
crystals shine brilliantly and are
stunning they actually add to the classy
high-end impression in win was going for
when designing this case also since this
is an N ATX case it is quite small when
compared to its ATX present I probably
helped with that last sentence the
flower pattern is flat to the touch and
is also very nicely done it is
strategically placed so that it doesn't
make the case look too busy or too plain
while adding a feminine touch to an
elegant looking case without it coming
off as cheesy okay we're good we made
them suffer enough so this is why I
don't do it
just cuz I'll make fun of you that's
yeah I did try it well we talked about
it earlier on in the stream I did try to
write uh what was it I think it was a
FAP I tried to write a fat one we don't
really use that terminology readily I'm
sorry fast as possible for our tech
quickie channel yes real quickie ones
anyway
yep yeah okay it's channel super fun dad
asks Nathan yes
epic weird random vids thank you
- can you do a house - I actually did a
house tour once and she flipped out yeah
because it's pretty easy to find
someone's house from an internal house
tour especially if they just bought it
because you can look through recent
listings in like sort of the general
area you wouldn't be able to find that
house to her anymore and you wouldn't be
able to find that listing anymore so
still no mabe what are you doing mate
sending more dude chill out
Rishi says we need more channels super
fun yeah adds dip thanks soo - thanks
Kyle Thanks Thunder mayor of Colton says
wanted to say I love that you took
YouTube to a new level and making
legitimate company out of it that really
has been the goal we're gonna keep we're
gonna keep changing so stay tuned for
that
Joey - what would you say to someone who
has lost hope in programming due to
chemical drugget
I have no idea well I think the first
thing to do would be to get help for the
diction yes I think it's easy to lose
hope when you're in that drugged cycle
yeah I guess you know more about drugs
and addiction than probably I do well
you just want to come out of that you
might find more positive things or find
more interest in other things because
that's I mean I've never done that I've
never been in that cycle but I hear that
when you're addicted to something like
you just that's all you can focus on
that's all you're interested in the
closest thing I've probably experienced
would have been the depression that I
went through during my second year of
house painting yeah second you know a
second year of house painting just like
kind of feeling like everything's
pointless and
like why would you even get up and just
kind of can't do it anymore can't face
the day like that kind of thing I it's
funny because it was during that time
where you swore you never wanted to
start a business ever again I know right
that was one of the big things that
really stressed me out probably her too
because she was a big part of supporting
me out of that the first time around but
that was one of the big things that
really stressed me out about starting
lanús Media Group was that I knew that
there were certain things that it's like
it's funny um people probably don't
think of me as shy or socially awkward
and I've come a long way in the last 10
years but go watch my first video the
Sun beam tunak tower over on the NCIX
tech tips channel that's me that's what
I'm more like that's me trying really
hard to come out of my shell and like do
a good job of presenting I don't think
that's you anymore you've grown a lot
from that right but that's my teacher
that's what you started yeah and
honestly one of the things that's made
it really a lot easier for me is that if
bears like like okay perfect example
just happened so for the employee lounge
the land center that we're working on
um I had told Yvonne I was like we
should get the same spray that we have
on the walls the same acoustic spray in
the rafters because it'll turn it black
which will make it less noticeable that
we don't really have a ceiling on it
kind of like in restaurants or they just
like paint their trusses and the roof
black so you don't really like kind of
see them so it'll do that and then it'll
also mean the acoustics in here will be
better and then the guy who does our
spraying for us hates doing small jobs
hates working with us for some reason
I'm actually not a hundred percent sure
why I think because we've changed the
scope of projects on him at the last
minute in the past and also because it
was really busy he's really busy and I
demand that he do a good job yeah so we
had him like come back and do like touch
up something touch up so the thing is
that normally I think in his line of
work just like spray they spray what
Park aids and things like yeah they
probably don't care about these statics
or anything like that exactly but we did
we did yeah so anyway he didn't want to
come back but she talked him into it I
got a quote and everything like that and
had the dime set and I was scheduled for
Monday that's Monday this Monday that's
coming Monday and so I come back to her
and I'm like I don't think we should do
the spray because if we ever wanted to
go back and pull permit for this
mezzanine as long as it's completely
exposed we could retroactively Lee get a
permit for it whereas if we spray the
whole bottom of it you won't be able to
see how it's fastened you won't be able
to you won't be able to inspect it
properly
have you already arranged the spray she
goes yeah can you call and tell them not
to like I I make Yvonne play the bad guy
for me so much because I just get this
like social anxiety about like tough
calls and tough decisions and stuff like
that so yeah I don't really remember I
was going with this anymore but that's
been a big part of why we've been able
to be a success that probably isn't
visible from the outside oh you were
talking about the student works
depression thing so actually even though
that was a bad experience yeah I think
the skills you learn from there
have transferred a lot absolutely do
Fahmy Joe Fahmy says what are you coming
to Australia I have no idea
I'll brief thoughts on t-series vs.
PewDiePie I don't really have a lot of
thoughts on that all of that all of that
takes place at a level of youtuber that
I'm just never gonna be
it's kind of cool going back and looking
at that stuff from like 10 years ago and
seeing that top performers on the entire
platform have like 1.3 million views me
like yeah I'm like you know 4 to 5 times
that or whatever now see I said it again
you know like 5 times that no but like
that was like 10 years ago like those
guys are operating on a completely
different level so we got here
have you gotten rid of the pink piece of
tasks Dione it's sitting in the parking
lot at the office right now yeah I
Strada complained about it recently
asked if we had storage insurance on it
we do we do we do yeah I think there's
some plans for it in January I don't
know if I'm allowed to talk about them
yet yeah we're gonna run over it with a
tank okay it'll be sponsored AAF says I
don't know if you watch Top Gear but my
wife says you're the Jeremy Clarkson of
computer so funny story I don't watch
Top Gear I've seen like clips here and
there but I actually consume very little
TV or movies but that doesn't prevent me
from wanting because I know I kind of
reverse-engineer content so I don't
actually watch a ton of YouTube I don't
watch a ton of TV but I do watch I do
eat a lot of comments on YouTube videos
like I will I will actually click on a
video that I'm curious about
and I might watch the first 30 seconds
or something like yeah okay I think I
kind of get it and then I'll just read
opponents will go what do people like or
not like about this about this concept
how do they feel about this person and
so a lot of the times I'll kind of
reverse engineer it so that doesn't
prevent me from saying yes Ltd's goal is
to be kind of the top gear of tech so I
think even though I don't watch the show
I think that was the goal you set two
years ago so
to see that comment is kind of amazing
great it's great that is exactly what
we're going for so even though I don't
watch Top Gear I'm glad it works on that
it's good thing other people on your
team do willpower pc's says please
update lions cat tips although that's
hard to do because we don't have our
cats anymore yeah they they both ran
away at one point or another and didn't
come back so yeah we're actually talking
about getting a new cat my daughter
broke down at breakfast earlier this
week just about broke my heart she's
telling me I don't know where rocket and
Rumble are and I don't know if they're
ever gonna come back and I kind of go oh
me neither sweetheart so that's the
thing that happened logan asks what's
the best gift for our family about to
have their third kid babysitting for a
week well you buy them tickets and hotel
for a vacation you have the best gift
not realistic gift mike says hope you
two are doing well been enjoying LTT
watching youtube what has been the
hardest part of being the leader at LTT
helping people helping people continue
to reach their own goals that's hard you
know in the cases of some people in
particular it's been like you can lead a
horse to water but you can't make it
drink and you see so much potential and
you you think you know these people are
brilliant and talented but they kind of
they kind of get stuck in their ways or
they get comfortable pushing people it's
the hardest part of our jobs yeah and
you don't always even though that's your
even though you're trying to help them
grow and develop them they don't
necessarily always see you as the good
guy when that happens that's really
roughest I feel like that gets put on me
a lot more than you so yeah that's been
really hard for me yeah I get to be like
the the pump up guy like I inspirational
speech like nobody's business I could
pull those out of my butt but like when
it comes to you know if someone's like
on the verge of tears they always go
straight to work mom yeah that's my
nickname not boss lady
they're both pretty brutal
Sean asked how slow-playing doing
bulwark creators be joining soon
we've had some stumbles we're still hard
at work on it more creators will be
joining as soon as we feel like we're
ready we don't really want more creators
on the platform when it's some not quite
ready yeah Tyrone says for maker content
get in touch with a ve would love to try
my best to get in touch with AV no
response whatsoever
if anyone like knows him feel free to
tell him go - is trying to get in touch
it was actually a while back when he was
complaining about his editing machine I
was like yo I head over there just like
build you an airing machine I didn't
want anything out of it just here we go
but I couldn't get in touch Michael says
thanks for the redemption stream yeah
welcome we did elaborate on the
male/female thing but we didn't quite a
bit earlier I don't know if we ever
finished it did we well the gist of it
is just that we hire based on male
replies who applies and merit and merit
yeah and passion yeah and if you don't
have a passion for tech it's a lot
harder to get hired at - Media Group .
ah
Zach hey guys now that you're
considering major content would you
create an extra channel no very unlikely
extra channels are spectacularly
expensive and not just from a money
perspective from a time perspective and
from an opportunity cost perspective so
if you're not familiar with the concept
of opportunity cost its how much it
costs to not be doing something else
that you should probably be focused on
and I don't is again I don't necessarily
mean that in terms of money but let's
talk money first because that's the
easiest to understand if I'm spending my
time let's say 10% of it a week working
on - make tips which frankly 10% of my
time is not enough time to do a good job
of running a YouTube channel obviously I
mean right now - tech tips I think does
a good job and requires probably more
like 75 percent of my time so 10% is
already not enough time so we have to
consider not just the cost of that
content that we're producing in the
space and the the crew and all that
stuff that we're doing we also have to
consider the cost
to Linus tech tips if we were doing an
extra sponsored video that month or if
we were doing an extra live stream
creating content for the 7 million
viewers that have subscribed to that
versus the you know 20 to 30 thousand
that we could probably get right away
with like a new channel announcement
there's an opportunity cost by not
taking advantage of this opportunity and
spending my time on that there's also
the opportunity cost of just me having a
life so I could not compromise on LTT go
work on the new channel and then not see
my kids anymore
but that's an opportunity cost that I'm
not willing to pay
did you finesse Yvonne with the socks
and sandals asks Ibrahim did you
actually wear socks and sandals only
first minute no I did not I used to wear
like grandpa shoes yeah yeah yeah yeah
black leather grandpa no let's say
that but you told me that you would like
see me on campus and be like so don't
even lie okay it made a bit I remember
you with your big winter big oversized
winter jacket I don't know I don't know
if that's the look I was giving yeah
find them you tell the story the way you
like be honest though well I like your
face you could dress better
Travis Sen LTX corrupt desks what
happens to super chat money we put it in
a big pile honestly we can't we don't
even read some of them like full full
disclosure guys we don't even read some
of them like we are so far from getting
to all of them on this stream and like
we're not going to be able to get to
them all because they come in faster
than we can read them if we want to do a
good job of answering them so given that
we we can't know sort of what they're
for they just go into the LMG coffers
you know the way you could think about
it is okay we're using a bunch of it to
build the employee lounge which is
costing not an insignificant amount of
money but is all about making the people
who work at lmg happier and have more
fun and be more passionate and be
excited to bring you guys great content
every day so everything that gets
contributed to us whether it's an
eyeball watching an ad or a sponsorship
placement or you know buying something
off of new meg with our affiliate link
or sending in a super chat whatever it
is it all contributes to us being able
to do a better job of what we're doing
and be able to provide for the people
that work with us like there are now so
whole sorry I gotta go an order of like
hired a maybe one I try to help you find
you at your clinic you I think there are
six people at Linus Media Group who have
used LMG money to buy a house hmm that's
huge you guys did that straight up
because without you those people are
still struggling as renters in Vancouver
and I expect as we continue to grow as
we continue to do better that there will
be more and yeah most of the people that
have managed to pull that off have been
the people that have been working here
since very early on but like you know we
always that's another thing with
creatives you always have to give them
room to advance and grow and I feel like
we've tried that's okay back to hardest
thing about your job that's really hard
is finding ways for people to continue
to advance and grow without letting the
overhead of running your company
outstrip the revenue that it can bring
in I mean I think we take a lot of flack
for how shamelessly we generate revenue
we've got you know Adsense we've got
sponsors we've got merch we've got
direct contributions we've got
floatplane we've got all these different
ways that people can help lmg make money
but it's also no accident that we help
the people we have a big team so that
people have can achieve work-life
balance and we compensate them well so
that they can achieve they can have a
good life that they're balancing with
that work and that's really important
that's important to us
hi sunder Schwar Daniel asks have you
updated your personal ring yet no it's
actually funny because we painted the
upstairs gently and to do that we have
to remove everything from the room
including our desks or computer setup
and sometimes like three months ago yeah
I don't think you ever put that yeah I
haven't missed it honestly it's funny
I've been fighting this battle with you
on how we need a third bedroom for our
kids because right now we have three
kids and they're all in this one big
room we combined two rooms into one just
select the mega room yeah they could
share and have a good time you know
sibling bonding all that but eventually
we're gonna need another bedroom I don't
have to move there's no way we'll see
okay we'll see yeah we'll see let's see
the point is I've been fighting you
about having another bedroom and you
inadvertently gave it you don't need it
you've proven that you don't need it
I need it for other things not
necessarily as a computer room I think
we should still have a computer in there
in fact you were whining to me that you
missed having a desktop yes and I'm not
putting down here here no communal
desktop family desktop then what year is
it
1998 we'll see we'll see anyway so to be
clear we don't agree about everything
key a door says it's not a question I
just want to say thanks your videos are
helping me through the death of my wife
yo dude I'm sorry
pretty heavy glad we can do something
I'm sorry to hear that
Ankit
says seeing mkbhd do hot ones in Joe
Rogan do you plan on doing something
similar for promotion LTX and the
channelings feel more mainstream very
underrated e yeah I we've gotten remains
dream but I don't know if we ever aspire
to the completely mainstream like
the day that I upload a video where I'm
geeking out over like PCI Express
bifurcation or something stupid like
that and the entire comment section is
like wTF is he talking about is probably
the day I quit like to me our community
is about sharing passion for tag not
like having a phone like that's not
passion for tag and so the viewers we
want to engage have to be the ones that
can appreciate even if they don't fully
understand it yet but have like a spark
somewhere that can be ignited for
technology and there's one person
internally who really wants to get me on
Joe Rogan experience in particular and I
was like sure yeah whatevs I've never
watched the podcast or anything like
that I'd like know who he is but like I
don't know like I never watched him
fight or anything like I'm not into MMA
or anything like that so yeah sure
whatever but I really don't think we're
a great fit for them because it's just
not that mainstream and I'm actually
okay with that like every time we'd
reached a new milestone I'd go well this
is it this is the plateau billion
subscribers there can't be more than a
million people in the world who are this
interested in a motherboard though okay
we're gonna be happy with this forever
and we're never gonna grow any more and
every time I keep being blown away at
how whether we are contributing to it or
whether it's happening naturally the
tech community just keeps growing and
we're big enough now that we don't need
to go more mainstream just totally
unnecessary if we went more mainstream
it would probably be a completely
separate channel and a spin-off business
and like I wouldn't want to interrupt
what we're doing now and quite frankly
you asked about another channel earlier
I don't even want to do that for all the
same reasons that I wouldn't want to do
another channel so would you consider
starting a gaming channel partnering
with an existing channel with its own
audiences can't think of a name probably
not that sounds like more hassle than
it's worth
we've always had our best success just
doing things from scratch and doing them
our way in some ways that's kind of my
superpower that I don't watch youtube
videos and
don't watch game streams because for
better or for worse I end up reinventing
the wheel a lot and people asked how do
you stand out on YouTube and I go well
do your own thing it's a lot easier to
do your own thing if you don't know what
other people think yes there's also
things that I really could have learned
a lot faster by watching others but
that's kind of a double-edged sword
Phillipe thank you Peter says you should
look at fpga boards they're super
interesting at some point maybe tres
says tried to meet you in Vancouver or
the crews doing a shoot didn't know
where you were I got to Mexico oh okay
that's cool
ah the German dude my PC isn't great can
you help me with reboot I'm actually not
even involved in the selection process
for a rig reboot so you'll have to suck
up to it probably cold actually Colton I
think had a few judges this year thanks
Chris Newsom yeah
tracers little over a month ago I didn't
know anything about computers today I
built my first gaming PC that's awesome
awesome
yeah thanks Samuel thanks Kota Broudy
Brian Louie oh sorry go ahead
oh no she's gonna say this person asks
if you have a degree I don't I have a
degree from the school of hard knocks I
flunked out so hard she's even a good
tutor great tutor couldn't get me
through calculus hey you got it for all
of five minutes and that was longer than
five minutes woman okay it was at least
an hour okay I like it clicked I was
like I get this I can do all these
problems and then the next day I woke up
went to my exam and had no idea what I
was looking at it's like okay well that
was short-lived so same thing with the
stroke butterfly and swimming stroke
butterfly I have done a grand total of
three lengths of Awesome butterfly in my
life and every time I've tried before or
since it's just been that flappy mess
anyone who's ever done fly knows once
you get it you feel it and I've been
there I got to experience it just once
and it was and then it was gone it was
so fleeting it was
or calculus someone asked didn't I go to
be CIT no I went to UBC yeah sort of I
went there sometimes yeah didn't show up
for a lot of classes fell asleep in the
pool it's so warm in there and I love
the smell of pool I was a lifeguard
chlorine it's beautiful
I'll tell you guys I'm gonna let you
guys a little secret when I go swimming
I actually don't tell off the chlorine I
just put on my clothes and I just let
myself smell like chlorine all day I
love it it's like it's one of those it's
one of those guilty pleasure smells like
gunpowder like it's not supposed to
smell good I don't think but Oh God full
of burning gunpowder's beautiful brian
says first time meeting you was at an
NCI hex fair way back when I would have
been like eight years ago crazy to see
how far you've come
thank you so yeah I tried to get a
science degree but I sucked
well you sucked at math I sucked you got
it you got physics way better at math I
understand things conceptually but I
have a really hard time with numbers
yeah let's see auras Elias says how good
are you at badminton how long even
playing for I've been playing for about
10 years and I'm pretty good I'm high
level recreational but like very low
level competitive King Peng son says
congratulations hope we can see the
scene every year no promises can't
promise that we will do a stream like
this every year
Wow did we actually catch up somebody
else oh I think we missed a bunch of the
I think we missed a bunch of the Super
chats cuz it just scrolled us down to
the bottom mike says the look of love on
Yvonne's face when - talks yeah I'm
going up I think we missed a lot of them
very all says I would like to give an
extremely belated apology for the most
Awkward hello I gave you about a year
ago or so while I was teaching your kids
swimming lessons no problem and you were
not the most awkward the most awkward
was like
straight up at the airport on my way
back actually wasn't even the most
awkward it was so funny kids like
walking past is like oh my god - for -
tech tips I'm like hey man what's up and
he's like this is so awkward right now
and then he just walks he just leaves
like well I didn't tell you that so good
so funny
yeah Wow this is so many comments that I
just cannot get to them all I'm so sorry
guys the tech fro says congrats on 10
years you inspired me to make a tech
channel that's cool I wish you the best
of luck you seem like you're getting
overwhelmed with them right now yeah I'm
just late just pick a spot and start
going I know I'm trying I was trying to
focus on the super chest just cuz it
like makes it easier because the other
things moving so slowly but now I feel
terrible because I've done some and not
others but like it's like a bad person
well thanks and thanks Timothy
okay maybe okay I'm gonna try I'm gonna
try look at some regular chance okay oh
dang
do you like potatoes now that's what I
got I like potatoes she's not much yep
any new events coming to LTX 2018 yeah
or 2019 yes it's gonna be huge casting
couch says Stefan
well we didn't own this couch yet when
she applied for the job of my girlfriend
okay thanks fun fact
oh wait Melissa's oh no second okay I
was a super chat so I can probably see
that one oh wow even those are going too
fast fun fact the aromatic chlorine
molecules are the result of chlorine
reacting the worse the smell the more
dirty the pool is that makes so much
sense because the pool I worked at I
mean I worked at it probably wasn't that
clean I wasn't in charge of cleaning I
just mean I knew that it
that's great when are you getting the
new motorcycle so I've done a little bit
more research on lightning bikes and a
hundred percent sure their glass door
reviews are terrible
if anyone's worked there and can sort of
contradict that then I would be happy to
open them up as a possibility to
purchase from again but right now I'm
just sort of on the fence about those
guys and I don't know of any other
electric bikes that have really tickled
my fancy I also now that I have an
electric car sort of it's plug-in hybrid
but it drives pure electric mode I'm
less excited about an electric bike it's
kind of boring I never thought I'd be
like I'm not a I'm not a gearhead I
never thought I'd be one of those guys
that's like yeah without the sound of
the engine what's the point but on the
bike without the sound of the engine
what's the point I just got a bigger
bike seriously I'd get like a like a big
internal combustion engine bike I tweet
appreciate your dedication to the tech
community you and Jo my go-to guys stays
a good guy you could have much worse
guys than us geez
I think there's ever a potential LTX
part two for adults are you talking like
a like a sex LTX
like adults only like whatever we're
talking about here okay regular LTX is
supposed to be for adults and kids but
it does tend to skew towards a younger
audience because I think a lot of the
adults are at work if you're talking
about a summer party type stuff then we
think there might be an after party this
year um Matt says can we say this moans
with my cable mod no congratulations on
all the success - 10 more years you know
what's funny I love what I do I have the
greatest job in the world but thinking
about 10 more years of this is actually
exhausting but things are really hard
right now or have been really hard
hopefully when you get more work-life
balance you'll feel better about yeah
oh man okay well you know what you guys
all 14,000 of you that are watching in
the middle of the night you guys are
absolutely amazing but I think after an
hour and a half we're probably gonna
have to call it has it really been an
hour now Wow elapsed time an hour and 36
minutes of complete stability streaming
from the blade stealth this time rather
than the phone phone Android YouTube app
oh one more act when does elem do you
give internships no unpaid internships
are illegal in Canada and if you want to
be paid then you might as well employ
apply as an employee that's the way I
see it well I think the difference is
that internships don't have to work
there permanently think you have to
identify things it like if I want you
then I want you permanently what do I
want with someone who's really good and
then goes away so from that employer
perspective I'm not like I just don't
really get it
jørgen what tips are advice to you after
starting a company any regrets things
you do differently I'm really happy that
we retained ownership little company
there was a time during the negotiation
when NCIX was pushing really hard to
have a stake in - Media Group and that
could have really screwed us when their
creditors came calling so like not
having outside parties involved - Media
Group has always been self-starter so no
matter what sort of financial milestones
we ever made it would be straight up
self-made and we're really proud of that
ah okay yeah okay thank you go Salome
kriti says didn't mean sex just
something with fewer kids yeah it's it's
tough to do because we do have more
adults in our audience than I think a
lot of people realize because they'll
see live meetups will be like it's all
kids they're well but like it's during
the day well this one is uh okay how
much are we allowed to see look can I
tell how many the other good no no no no
they're gonna know you're gonna know
about the event later I just mean like
naturally something like VidCon has a
lot more kids
even if lots of adults watch YouTube it
just is what it is I think adults just
have stuff to do sometimes and they
can't make it yeah like that's all there
is to it I think kids just have a
greater degree of flexibility in terms
of being able to you know bug off and
like go to a convention and I'm not
saying adults don't go to conventions
I'm just saying greater degree of
flexibility so I think the audience in
the audience at a live event tends to
skew younger than the audience at home
that is like you know just gotten home
after a long day's work and wants to
wind down and watch some YouTube videos
it doesn't mean that either of them are
any less of a fan of the channel it just
means that you get these different
audiences showing up in different places
it's just like how the demographics are
different on mobile versus desktop for
example just as what it is alright
alright thank you yeah really thank you
