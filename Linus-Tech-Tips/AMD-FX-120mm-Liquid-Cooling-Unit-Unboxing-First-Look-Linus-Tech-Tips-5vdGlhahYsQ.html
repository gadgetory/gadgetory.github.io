core processor black edition with liquid
CPU cooling system however I should tell
you guys now this is a sample of the
liquid cooling system that does not have
a CPU inside so there you go
overclock and don't overheat liquid CPU
cooling system easy vent tubes for
maximum flexibility quiet high
performance pulse width modulation I
think they mean PWM radiator fans
brilliant customizable RGB LED ok that's
kind of cool custom fan speed control
software as well as aa more about the
CPU that is not in here because this box
includes an AMD processor that is not in
here installation instructions limited
warranty information a liquid CPU
cooling system designed for use in a
desktop PC so let's have a look at what
is just the liquid cooling system from
AMD so you can see right here who the
OEM for this particular liquid cooling
system might happen to be ASA tech shows
you how to install it ok cool beans next
we have the liquid CPU cooling chill
control software which you should not
use you should download the latest from
someone's website whether it happens to
be AMD or ASA tech ok it includes
mounting hardware for AMD systems there
you go so we got screws for the fans
screws for the hold down plate as well
as a little ring that goes here
apparently
there goes somewhere ok and then
mounting clips it is compatible with
a.m. 2 a.m. 2 + a.m. 3 a.m. 3 + 2 fans
included they seem to be of some kind of
reasonable quality because they don't
have like a ton of flex to them these
are ever flow motor your life are 1 to 1
2 to 5 su fans and there are two so you
can mount them in push-pull if you see
fit
or you can just put one of them on your
CPU and like put the other ones
somewhere else they're reasonably
nice-looking we've got you a little
AMD sticker going on there that's green
as well as nice short for pin pwm
connectors that are using all black
wires and then a black connector so they
are very aesthetically pleasing if
nothing else all right as you can see
there is no CPU in the box although
yours would have a CPU in the box here
we see the bottom cold plate as they
call it or CPU block as I think we
should probably be calling it with pre
applied thermal interface material it is
a very high quality Tim that is
installed on the bottom of these ASA
tech coolers I do know that for a fact
changing it out with something better
actually will not really net you much in
terms of a performance gain here we have
the power for the pump itself as well as
the pass-through that will power the fan
so this cable right here runs to power
both of your PWM fans and it can control
the fan speeds on both of them at the
same time you can see the only wire that
is not running to the second connector
is the RPM monitor so the RPM monitor
will only work on one of the fans as
long as they are both plugged into the
radiator you would hopefully notice that
the radio that one of the fans isn't
working long before both of them failed
and then you know your CPU wasn't
getting any cooling because as long as
one of them is going you should be fine
so this uses a thick style radiator much
like the course are each 70 or H 80
which means that if you are running in
push-pull it's ideal because there is a
lot of resistance to the air being
pushed or pulled through the radiator if
you don't have two fans and in order to
get the best possible performance out of
the surface area you have available you
want to make sure you're pushing lots of
airflow through it now when they talk
about super flexible tubes they are not
kidding these are just like the end the
ones on the enttec 920 where you can
bend them up like this and you can see
look ma no kinks so you will be able to
get adequate liquid flow to your CPU
regardless of what kind of a you know
contortionist configuration you have to
do in order to get the block positioned
correctly over your over your processor
now the other thing that can be a bit of
a challenge for these is you got to make
sure you do have adequate room in your
case most cases that accept a 120
millimeter cooling fan at the back will
work with this kind of a radiator you
can see there's a small tank at the top
as
well as a small tank at the bottom but
on the sides there fairly little
profiles so it's exactly the width of
okay slightly more than the width of a
fan I think that pretty much covers it
if you want to know how it performs go
find out how in each 70 performs and
it's gonna be pretty much that but
probably a little bit better because
these are better fans and you got your
unlocked FX processor thing going on on
the top here that's where the RGB LEDs
are so you can actually change the color
of the FX in there I guess I'd recommend
red I mean you can make it blue if you
want but I think we all know why that
would be wrong so don't forget to
