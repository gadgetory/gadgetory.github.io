graphics party so we're going to do this
in a slightly different way than we've
done before and that is to say instead
of taking a big schwag of video cards
and testing them we're going to take a
schwack of price point so about a
hundred bucks about 200 bucks and about
300 bucks and tell you head-to-head
GeForce vs. Radeon which one comes out
ahead at that price point now besides
our standard graphics card test bench
which has our OC z ZX 1250 watt it's got
a vertex for 128 gig 16 gigs of kingston
hyperx ram and a CSP 9 X 79 deluxe
motherboard and obviously the graphics
card varies a little bit we've got a 13s
3930k on here now whatever it is it's
overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz meaning
that we've removed the CPU as a
bottleneck as much as possible and aside
from all that we are overclocking every
graphics card to within what is
according to lei forums a reasonable
level that most people can expect to
attain so because we've done graphics
card overclocking guides we expect you
to overclock your graphics card because
if you're not you're basically throwing
away free performance so we no longer
test graphics cards at stock which means
whatever models we have here actually
doesn't really matter the important
thing is the GPU and then the fact that
it's overclocked to within what you can
probably attain with the same GPU so
let's start with our lightweight
showdown so at the approximately a
hundred dollar price point we had the
Radeon HD 7770 and GeForce GTX 650
unfortunately at about 100 bucks we
couldn't afford the 650 Ti so it was a
hundred and twenty three dollars for the
Radeon card and one hundred and fourteen
dollars for the GeForce card we take all
of our pricing from NCIX at the time of
filming our video we are using the
latest drivers on all of these cards so
that's catalyst thirteen point one and
whatever the latest GeForce one is so we
take the second lowest card on NCIX so
that it's a price that you can
reasonably find and we leave off mail-in
rebates because not all territories have
them so in this case it was a bit of a
one-sided battle with the 7770 beating
the GTX 650 by about 40%
if the 650 Ti had been able to squeeze
into this price bracket
we'd probably see it come in quite a bit
closer if not approximately the same as
the 7770 but we weren't able to make
that happen with the constraints that we
set for ourselves so we're going to move
on to our next price point in this one
we've got the GeForce GTX 660 this is
the non TI version so it is
significantly slower but it is based on
the same core as the 660ti up against it
we have the Radeon HD 7870 so this is
their top line whatever this core is not
Tahiti the other one can't remember
don't worry about it 78 70 there we go
oh yeah we're using the ultra preset in
Far Cry 3 we're using our custom
benchmark which of course you can check
out in a video that we made on our
channel for how to run our exact
benchmark no anti-aliasing 1080p and our
pricing was pretty close now it should
be noted that the Radeon card does cost
about 8 percent more than the geforce
card in this case but it performs about
25 to 30 percent better in this case so
I would personally spend an extra 8% to
get another 20 percent performance so to
speak so in this case yeah it was a bit
of a Radeon Radeon sort of win as well
next up we've got the about $300 price
points so 660ti is going to be up
against the 7950 both of these cards are
very well positioned they're the ones
that I generally recommend on either
side of the fence you want a geforce
card i usually say okay get a 660ti you
want a Radeon card generally I say get
one of these bad boys and the reason for
that is they're both great overclockers
and great performers at stock remember
these are all overclocked numbers were
showing you so in this case our Radeon
card was around 300 bucks
our geforce card was around 290 bucks so
they're very close in terms of pricing
however once they're both overclocked
the Radeon card does come out ahead by
about 12 13 14
whatever 10 to 15 percent so there it is
a win for the Radeon camp I mean all of
this should probably stand to reason
given that far cry 3 was a never settled
bundled game with Radeon graphics cards
so it looks
like it looks like Ubisoft and AMD we're
working together on making sure that
it's optimized for AMD platforms
hopefully we'll see some kind of a
driver update from Nvidia that will
address the sort of performance
disadvantage however it should be noted
this is just one game what I'd love for
you guys to do now though is tell me are
you interested in seeing these videos
done on a game by game basis moving
forward in the future or is this kind of
a forum on that forum format not that
useful for you let us know and also guys
if you check the description under the
video we are going to post these graphs
so you can review them at your leisure
without actually skimming through the
video and finding them so there you go
