the core thing about g-sync that they're
touting here is the ability that lets
you get away from completely isochronous
or fixed time slices for your games now
time slices have been with us for the 50
years since television when you've got
you had to refresh the screen in these
continuous patterns because the light
from the phosphor is just decayed it
went away with backlit LCD displays the
lights continuous there so there is no
sensible reason why we have to be doing
that and because we are we get these
artifacts of either tear or judder so
it's really good to get away from that
now if you try for a high frame rate
like 60 frames per second which but I've
been a big proponent of if you miss it
hurts really bad you you know you drop
all the way down to 30 frames per second
Wow
with something like g-sync if you if you
take 17 milliseconds instead of 16
milliseconds nobody can even tell it
just comes out as a tiny delay on the
frame and that's a wonderful thing so
that's one real advantage if you're
trying hard for a frame rate it makes
your inevitable miss imperceptible if
you're not even trying if you're just
making a game that's randomly running it
whatever the hell frame rate it turns
out it magically works out on this if
you're going between 20 and 80 frames
per second like you know a lot of games
will if they're unconstrained there this
makes that beneficial it means that it's
smooth at 20 but then at 80 it's silky
and this is a really great thing now the
interesting tension that we've got here
is that I didn't really appreciate this
a year ago but the persistence on a
display the fact that it is continuously
illuminated contributes to a lot of
subtle blurring effects on the screen
when you look at like a text you know
like a webpage if you pan it across the
screen smoothly or if you scroll like an
iPad or something even if it's scrolling
at a perfect 60 frames per second
smoothness it's hard to read because it
feels blurred in the direction that it's
moving and that is a consequence of the
persistence the fact that it's
continuously illuminated the solution to
that is to only illuminate it very
briefly now this happened automatically
for CRT displays as the electron beam
scanned over you only had you know
microseconds of illumination from that
before it went away and there's a
category of people that would talk about
like sports broadcasting where they'd
complaint is never been the same
you've got flat panels because
everything is a little bit more smeared
on the pans
I never really noticed that so much but
in a head mounted display it is night
and day there's one of the more dramatic
technology demos that you can do to have
a display that you can switch between
low persistence and full persistence
it's a big deal
now the interesting thing is in the last
couple years
Nvidia's had their light boost
technology for the 3d my vision stuff
and you could put that in you could use
that as a low persistence monitor people
wrote firmware hacks to be able to do
this so if you made 120 Hertz game and
doom 3 BFG was one of the few things
that is it's an old game and we paid a
little bit of attention you could run it
at 120 frames per second locked and you
could put into a mode like this and it
was pretty awesome but no modern game
runs at 120 frames per second a let
alone stereo for a head-mounted display
because right now people will just say
I'm a thirty Hertz game and why bother
and even if you try for 60 no that's
enough some blood sweat and tears to get
there pushing further beyond as hard but
g-sync makes it a smooth continuum so
every bit that you do to help helps you
know it is better to be at 70 than to 6
and then 60 it's better to be at 40 than
30 this is a good thing and I think that
this will be a path that can start
bringing some games up now we've got the
other tension of like 4k displays it's
like okay let's go back down to 30
frames per second to do a 4k display but
at least there's the option of possibly
pushing up because once you get over 90
95 Hertz
ideally up to 120 or 140 for some of
these monitors will run at you can start
doing this low persistent stuff but the
problem with this and this is an
interesting tension I if you do the low
persistence and you bury your frame rate
then it changes the intensity of what
you're looking at so what needs to
happen is you need to vary the length of
the illumination based on how long the
frame rate was now g-sync can do all of
these things they actually they they
didn't want us to really talk about this
aspect of g-sync these I thought I would
confuse the you know I the people
listening but I actually think that's
pretty important where it's got the low
persistence option right now it's binary
you can go to 120 Hertz and be low
persistence or you can be at variable
framerate but there's no reason why this
can't be combined where you
adapting one towards the other then you
get this option where the best world the
best case of this would be the game is
running if it's running at 20 30 frames
per second it's full persistence it's
just variable but as the game creeps up
and it gets over 90 frames per second
then it can start adapting the backlight
to it and that'd be great so you might
have a game where only in some simple
scenes are you at low persistence
wonderfulness while in your massive
outdoor exploding everything then it's
falling down as for persistence but that
would be great it's making things better
where they can be better and there's a
lot of other uses for this type of thing
like I had mentioned Android
specifically because I did complain that
you take the like the Nvidia shield
where it's got should have plenty of
horsepower but if you play sonic on it
it drops frames every now and then and
that's not the fault of the GPU or the
CPU it's the fault largely of the power
management and what happens on Android
where they're they're constantly trying
to save power by adapting the core count
and the frequencies on these things and
unfortunately what happens is they often
pull the power down until you start
dropping frames which is exactly the
wrong thing to do so we can fight that
by saying well we want a dedicated
amount of core cores and frequency but
then you waste power where really the
optimal thing would be let them manage
the power as they do now and use
variable refresh technology to just mean
when you slightly miss it it will be
imperceptible if you go to 17
milliseconds for your frame instead of
15 there and that will be a great thing
but even invidious knows that even
though they own that platform it's gonna
be integrating with another display
vendor pushing things through
integrating with more Android stack
these are hard cross company issues and
NVIDIA it's great that Nvidia did this
I've been harping on this for a number
of years but it took something a company
like Nvidia that can change GPUs and
that can change the hardware that can
write the drivers for it that can you
know leverage the display vendors to
actually put something like this in it
could have happened five years ago it
would have been good to happen five
years ago but you know it's finally
happening now
thank you very much everyone appreciated
you taking the time
I would offer demanded thank you okay
all right
we're gonna go try to intercept in
Sweeney
hey Tim can I borrow you for just a
couple minutes just to basically say hi
to the viewers sure okay I am going to
have to okay this is very challenging
okay but can you kind of reach past me
here and do you see channel one where
it's there's an anim yep can you switch
that to a and then same with channel two
so there you guys have it Tim Sweeney
that's my camera so we've got about
3,000 viewers on here right now that are
that are watching live so you know what
I guess probably the most appropriate
thing given that we're at in videos
event is can you talk a little bit about
do you think and how important you think
it is oh sure um is really important
piece of technology it enables a games
running any framerate to have the
smoothness that you get from running at
a constant framerate you know right now
to achieve 60 frames a second perfect
smoothest if to make great sacrifices in
a game and if you just go one frame
below it to 59 and suddenly your game's
interrupted by these massive starters
and the g-sync tech really creates a
continuum so that whatever level of
frames the agam is outputting can be
displayed smoothly and without these
crazy art effects that you have in games
nowadays it means a gamers game
developers a we would have create really
awesome levels of content and still
achieve the sort of smoothness that you
get in games like Call of Duty for
example I mean one of the things that
the average person I think really
doesn't understand is build they're
quick to blame any kind of a framerate
issue on well the game optimization
isn't very good can you talk a little
bit about the ballot the delicate
balancing act that you guys go through
to deliver both great level of detail
and a smooth gaming experience sure it's
a constant trade-off for a game
developer you know what Gears of War for
example we aimed at creating the most
impressive visual experience we could
while trying to hit 30 frames a second
pretty consistently but you know once in
a while there's a moment when the game
drops below that and it really
impacts the quality because you're not
dropping to 29 or 28 frames a second
you're jittering back and forth between
20 and 30 and it's just a it's just
really bad this type makes it much
easier to all games that have a high
level of smoothness and that's going to
mean a lot more games will be smooth in
the future it's it's one of those kind
of magical technologies that you don't
necessarily look at the screen and
recognize exactly what's going wrong it
just looks wrong and it looks jittery
and unrealistic for reasons that are
hard to identify when you see it working
perfectly it's an entirely different
experience so in your mind would we see
something akin to gsync on handhelds
televisions along with PC monitors and
how far out do you see that in the
future I mean how much would you love to
have this on the console we'd love to
have this everywhere
televisions projectors mobile LCD
displays it's going to be especially
important for you know products like
oculus where you want to have a very
high inconsistent frame rate for fast
response time this technology it's
starting at like almost everything it's
an innovation in the industry it's
starting on high-end PC and it will work
its way throughout the rest of the
industry over the coming years all right
well I don't want to take up too much of
your time I know that you're supposed to
be up here for the panel but I
appreciate you just taking the time to
say hi to the viewers and I would shake
your hand but if nothing else I'm gonna
try and have like a photo-op sort of
that's the best we were able to do thank
you so much for taking the time yes so
there you guys go have you forgiven the
enforcer now the Foresters not bad good
because he helped us sync up with Tim
Sweeney so there you go Tim over there
actually he wandered away from us over
to the G sync demo you can see he's got
his face about four inches from the
screen okay maybe we're not gonna leave
him alone just yet
okay just for fun we're gonna bother you
again here you're playing around with
the demo right now correct yes yes this
has three modes of vsync novi sync and
gsync of course in a video of this you
are not going to see any of what I'm
talking about but the difference in
smoothness is really impressive with
visa you see you don't see tearing
artifacts but you do see an
inconsistency with the framerate
consistently you know jittering back and
forth between one frame rate and another
because of the way that frame rates are
discretized I never knew what was wrong
vsync always felt off to me I never
liked it
well it's subtle so you turn off vsync
and you have a different set of errors
which is that each scanline is
independently experiencing its own
discretization but now you're getting
this tearing where half of the screen is
the previous frame and half of the
freeness in the next frame
wherever arbitrarily in time the change
and then what you think it's displaying
frames at a consistent rate and so you
get a lack of jittering artifacts and
look here the frame rate is varying here
in places it's dropping probably even
below definitely around 30 frames a
second but this smooth dropping from 60
down to 30 as much much less disturbing
than dropping frames one at a time
and what you're looking at right now
looks like a very extreme example it
looks like the first it looks like the
first thing Tim did when he got here was
cranked the frame time minimums all the
way down and the maximums all the way up
or was it already like that when you got
here okay really the worst case so when
the debt so the way the demos running
here let me show you this guy so it's
mayhem in a multiplayer game where
they're enormous numbers of players is
causing crazy spikes and frame pile all
the time but here what do you think you
won't appreciate it in this video
because it's a video of a screen with a
different display resolution and
sampling rate but it's just uh it is
polished to the point where there's this
old text on the spinning pendulum and
you can actually read it which is
astonishing because if you go turn off
vsync and then it's tearing it makes it
hard it's distracting your eye away from
it it's a it's making a really big
qualitative difference very cool okay
thank you we really will we really will
stop bothering you now thank you so guys
I mean you would never really see okay
so the way the demo set up for minimum
and maximum frame times so it's it's
kind of swinging between 60 and 30 and
that really does present a very
worst-case scenario I mean that's kind
of like an artificial situation where
you're looking down at something
intensive like a scene with a bunch of
stuff exploding and then swinging your
your camera up to the ceiling and then
back down and then back up and then back
down and back up and you trying to make
the experience disconcerting and that's
the worst case scenario that we're kind
of looking at over there and even then
it's pretty darn smooth
someone says g-sync will somehow
adoption will affect it doesn't g-sync
will affect the people who buy the gear
that runs it there there's no you don't
have to wait for any industry adoption
other than making sure that there are
monitors that have the technology built
into them which nvidia is saying will be
available as as early as q1 next year so
it'll be up to the individual to adopt
it and enjoy it and that's that it'll
work on any game it'll work on any
Kepler based GPU and it will work on any
g-sync enabled monitor and you don't
have to wait for game developers to
enable anything you don't have to wait
for any else anything else to happen
g-sync we're going to
a very small initial user base because
it's based on a popular TV you and a
particular monitor that as a particular
partnership minute hello crystal ball
again
so is this within the next five years we
will be able to actually forget about a
target for a great of the game and
assume that the end user can experience
it really reducing in delivery this is
gonna be pretty addictive because this
is not like it doubles the size that
died of something to do this it's not
that expensive technology there like he
went into these licensing cost and what
are going to be on here but I this is
something that should be broadly tossed
like guys like from a pure technology
standpoint this is just the right thing
and I obviously in early years this is
just gonna be smooth this benefit birth
for people but in the space of five
years or something I would hope
something like this is pretty much
absolutely you also there's a limited
amount of things they monitor
manufacturer human factor connection can
be done once you have the only things in
yeah suddenly this is actually a good
baby please remove the the sharpening
that detection and the motion
compensation and actually add this and
forty pixels would be nice also and I
think it will be when people actually
see the planes it's been doing and more
of your people see nuts will actually be
a lot of product movement in the world
industry to transitions or something
like this really by quick and that's
been a hopefully because that
actually doesn't say the target games
more specific important stuff yeah
Kentucky the rest of the industry needs
to hardware up every display device
every platform including mobile
platforms we need to adopt this kind of
technology over the next few years
because it's it's visually striking
doesn't show up in a TV commercial but
it's to the new player playing game it's
incredibly apparent the difference in
visual quality here and so it's going to
be a major initiative for everybody or
else people are gonna look at and take
over that looks like you know the last
generation actually well one which I
have there is that when going to these
bodies retail stores when they sell tons
of Tulsa to displace or monitors that
you see all of them standing there
really nice monitors really nice big
screen TVs look amazing and all them are
set and actually gave a start-up
showroom move mode that just cranks out
all of the colors I would like to
replace that removed that note the
showroom mode is that it does not exist
in more instead of us have this greater
than you actually see the difference on
that the false colors you don't want to
have that anyway that's not calibrated
to anything that we actually create it
just creates a new artificial
environment plus all the dollars
we'll sit back absolutely logistics wise
just a second in terms I've got to go
catch a flight I didn't want to I didn't
want to take off without thanking you
guys properly you guys you guys not only
make make the show make the launch you
guys to be made out here I mean this is
a quite a privilege to have you guys
anywhere but have the three of you guys
in the same place at the same time and
having this kind of access to you guys
it is really really a privilege it's a
privilege for me another push for
everybody in the audience
it's just so much fun to listen to you
guys I want to thank you guys for
everything you've done for the game
industry but not just a game industry
for the computer industry the technology
industry and just good old-fashioned
people needs in general ok I think you
guys are fantastic I love you guys love
your friendship
they certainly
or K versus g-sync what is more
important today the disagree yeah I mean
at this point look at we will all be
able to suck up to the resolution but
right now people migrate to 4k and they
get much lower frame rates on the
experiences I think the trade-offs
already hit a little bit south of
optimal but people are making pallet
so my point is do you think you don't
want to go back to anything else well I
got the whole issue about the the low
persistence smooth displays that I have
to deal with them out of it i displace
systems high but I think that for a
conventional desktop monitor I really
want to see this just absolutely the
good news is it doesn't have to be or
there
if those were team honors that there are
not g-sync because you see them
shuttering and tearing and exactly the
problems we've been talking about now
it's actually an object lesson there is
a she 4k is kind of a workstation
application for the next few years right
in that timeframe
we'll be using these liners for building
games because we all have a huge set of
complex tools and photographers will be
using for their work videographers lots
of people will be isn't but I don't
think it's the right output resolution
for rendering until your TV is
significantly faster consumer knows like
what said 28th tariff boxes in a single
GPU depositing 300 bucks that's what you
want to go 4k and is when you need to
stay in 30s and 60 to 90 frames per
second and then actually just to pull up
without the department's forever just
essentially happen
well because it's for the moment for
each beam and the 4k screen and mix it
up and then they're putting them in half
circle and Rob you this section are
really good work environment workspace
so having a single 4k screen that's
curved and 50 inch or something I would
actually replace our high speeds that
would be a decent work environment for
we play games to the issue numerous away
in there also and you started to see
these curved screen co-occur : screens
in that size
and basically management diversity of
perfect gaming and perfect coordination
while we're at it another vertical
section screen so the focus is properly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
