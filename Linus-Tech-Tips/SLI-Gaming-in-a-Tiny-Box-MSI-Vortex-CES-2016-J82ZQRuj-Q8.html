Lynas Media Group to CES 2016 check out
the link in the video description to
learn more about Squarespace so there's
a lot of stuff in the msi booth they've
got like a stardestroyer computer they
got a bunch of liquid-cooled computers
they got eye tracking they got VR they
got all this stuff but this this is the
focal point this is the center of the
room this is the vortex and this is the
actual cause of a legitimate argument
between me and someone that I've
actually known for years at MSI and I
would have considered a friend until I
came into the booth and he told me no -
you may not open the vortex so inside
this kind of Mac Pro shaped but actually
slightly bigger cylinder PC they have a
phenomenal amount of hardware so they
got a core i7 6700 km as a skylight
processor up to 64 gigs of DDR 4 RAM
loaded on so-dimm memory stick so that's
notebook memory 6 up to 2 GTX 980 s note
the absence of an M yes that is in
videos new m XM gtx 980 - m dot 2 s SD
slot so you can throw in nvme SSDs you
can put them in raid if that's even
supported yet I mean you don't even need
to could just throw throw 1 nvme in here
throw another like you know storage nvme
because you're apparently a baller
because it's priced at anywhere from
$2,000 for the one with 960 s to $3,000
for the one with 980 s but you're
probably asking yourselves well hold on
a second Linus how did they get to 980 s
and SLI a gtx 6700 k up to 64 gigs of
ram and two drives in here great
question and you can actually watch
Apple's keynote on the Mac Pro online
because it was I'm sorry MSI because it
was actually done in a fairly similar
manner so instead of relying on the more
traditional PC configuration where
you've got the box with all the
components kind of against one side
they've actually got multiple completely
custom laid out PCBs inside here with
one gigantic blower fan on the top that
MSI is claiming is capable of something
in the name
like 22 decibels at idle and in the low
30s under load making it not only
extraordinarily powerful but extremely
quiet and they didn't skimp on IO either
at the back you'll find four USB 3.1
ports two HDMI ports two mini display
ports and two USB 3.1 type-c ports with
Thunderbolt support for a total of six
display outputs natively supported if
you count the USB 3.1 type C and also
Thunderbolt three ports oh yeah I guess
it's got dual land as well audio ports
and all the usual stuff now this is not
the final hardware it isn't launching
until q2 which is apparently why they
won't let me open it but I have somewhat
forgiving cliff because he has assured
me and now this is this is documented
this is documented cliff he has assured
me that Linus tech tips will be the
first to cover the finalized system you
have my work there's a drop a comment on
the video and let me know if you are
excited to see us tear apart the vortex
and reveal its secrets to the world
I didn't bring a screwdriver can you
believe I didn't bring a screwdriver
everyone came so prepared for me this
year I walk in there like no you can't
open it so thanks for checking out this
video here at the msi booth guys don't
miss any of our CES 2016 content by
