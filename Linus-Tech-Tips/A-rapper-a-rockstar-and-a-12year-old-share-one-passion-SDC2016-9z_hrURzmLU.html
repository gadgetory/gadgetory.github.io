Developers Conference was the how do we
say up widening definition of mobile
developer so we took some time to learn
about three very different projects from
three very different individuals first
up is Flo Rida yes that Flo Rida
turns out he's working on a mobile game
called speed gods it's a racing game and
it's all caps all bold and all
italicized and if that's anything to go
by it might be as loud as it is fast so
I wanted to open with one that's really
actually quite personal for me so would
you consider putting my car in your game
let me see what kind of car this is okay
at least it has an engine oh man how
much you gonna pay oh no no it's all
custom and it's not cheap oh that's
that's custom mandala pepto-bismol on
wheels all right well I guess that's my
answer so why don't we get down to the
more serious stuff then can you walk me
through the progression from musician
and performer to game developer I mean
this must be a passion project for you
yeah definitely but it's very organic
because oh my god Chris I'm three gaming
you know he's been trying to pitch ideas
to me you know since the start of my
career but I had to do something enough
that would be you know what have that
wow factor as well as my music this game
is like I said it's very organic to
myself we have some of the flyest cars
in there you know with me having a guy
who loves music you know we definitely
have some of the hottest music and
everything in there so I mean that's
what all started from I'll let the guys
know and Chris you know he's a great
friend of mine so he know I've actually
been on out on you know the NASCAR track
racing and things like that so from from
the from I was particular about how fast
the cars will move how agile the cars
was I felt like you know being a guy
putting on the game for the first time
it has to be perfect so I definitely was
on those guys you know every moment you
know like this represents me and I
needed to be perfect for my fans you
decided on a mobile game well we all
know that you know we live by our phones
you know so I can't go nowhere without
my i7 and
at the same time we create in this game
I felt like you know it would be a plus
if even if I wasn't a part of it this
game would be high so it had to be hot
you know rather if I was a part of it
not what makes Speed gods different from
other mobile racing games there's
hundreds of them
well speed gods as a trip will take you
have some of the Flyers cause it's so
surreal as well as you have myself
what's the game without floor attic but
that's not to say that every musicians
mobile app has to be tightly tied into
his or her music career and Tommy fair
you might know him from a little band
called kiss is working on of all things
a kid's storytelling app called earnest
hummingbird that's due out in August
tell me how do you bridge the gap
between songwriting and performing and
creating a children storytelling
application for phones you know it's
it's it's tricky no it's actually pretty
easy bridging that gap is actually a lot
of fun and I really enjoy it because
what I do usually in rock music you know
it's very defined what we do so when we
have a children's storybook app like
Ernest hummingbird I can be inspired by
the imagery and the aesthetic of it it's
outside of the box so to speak for one
from what I usually do so I've really
enjoyed doing this it's been a lot a lot
of fun the reason we went with doing a
store of a app rather than a traditional
television show to begin with or
whatever it may be is that with new
technology new media and all the
exciting things that are happening
particularly here at this Developers
Conference that is the avenue that I'm
interested in and I think that because
it's really what's happening it's where
the future is going you know with with
mobile apps and and like I said new
media this is the new form of
distribution for music and storytelling
and all the things that we're doing so
we're embracing that and and you know
that's the direction things are going
for sure
which leads us then to our last unusual
developer youngling Yong Jun Lee from
Korea evolved from simple block based
coding in App Inventor to Android studio
where his plant watering reminder app
for Android won him the junior software
cup and
to comment speak at the developer
conference he was obviously a little
nervous but he did an amazing job of
walking us through the various features
of the app adding plants setting up
watering schedules creating nicknames
and even drawing little avatars for the
plants and his shockingly deep thought
process for all of the features and
functionality honestly I wasn't really
expecting for a grand prize when I
attended to the cop because the grand
prize actually had only one prize within
elementary middle and high school so I
wasn't really expecting to get that
prize but um being here and what winning
that prize I really cherish this moment
for for for a long time the reason the
main reason I kind of game if I did was
because I wanted the user to be
encouraged watering plants isn't really
an exciting thing that's the same thing
with a drawing feature I just wanted to
make the user feel encouraged and being
tricked to water those plants yeah
because I really like living things my
career to bylaw gist is hasn't really
changed but I think I can be kind of a
bio gramma so something that can
actually simulate to some reach research
on biologist by computer programming and
so my goal drink whatever I want to call
it is actually biologists and also a
programmer yeah I actually really love
your hand-drawn paint inspired icon
design you do them all yourself
yeah
I just wanted some emotional kind of
little icons because many people think
that machine is really something that is
cold and something that is really hard
but I think by that strong this I really
put some emotional contents in my app so
yeah I think those drawings really
represented me my some kind of goal that
I wanted to use a to feel so I hope you
