down below also thank you to a soos and
Corsair we're checking out at Razer
today is the Razer Wildcat this is
Rangers first foray into Xbox one styled
controllers and this controller is
compatible with Xbox one and PC is
running Windows 7 and above the last
controller they released was the Razer
saber-tooth that was an Xbox 360 style
controller and this one kind of grows on
that it's just improved in a few
different ways that I actually really
like the main change that I like is that
on the back of the controller we're on
the saber-tooth we saw a rocker switch
two rocker switches we now see two
actual triggers these triggers are a lot
more solid what I didn't like about the
saber tooth's were that they kind of
would slide back and forth and over time
they can I got a little bit weaker these
triggers feel a lot more solid and
they're also easier to remove just like
the last one it's a hex screw that
removes them but unlike the last one
instead of having rubber plugs to
stopper off the area you just drop the
little plug in cartridge thing down into
the controller and it looks very natural
and they're also much smaller which is
actually kind of cool you won't have
your fingers get caught on them more
easily and even if you're not using them
they feel much more natural just like
the saber-tooth you have your stock
normal shoulder buttons and your
additional hyper response button buttons
from Razer what I like this time around
though is on the saber-tooth you could
feel them actuate but this time you can
feel and hear them actuate so much like
the mechanical ABXY buttons you can
actually hear them moving on from there
you have a three meter or 10 foot long
braided USB cable which they got rid of
this screw connector for the screw
character was kind of cool but caused
some issues so now they've gone for more
just general compliance with a micro USB
plug it has rails on the side of it so
you're not gonna plug it in incorrectly
and like I said it's long and braided so
that's actually pretty cool
just like the saber tooth you have the
same analog stick grip caps that we had
before but now there's also palm grips
optional palm grips we unfortunately
don't have them here today so you might
just see a still image of the more some
but it actually looks pretty cool the
triggers have received an upgrade now on
the bottom of the controller there's two
sliding switches one for each one of the
triggers and it's a trigger stop so
basically if you don't have the trigger
stop engaged you can pull all the way
down and it's a smooth long-distance
pull it's going to be more careful about
your shooting or with the trigger stop
engaged it's a short pole and you get
more rapid fire shooting depending on
what mood you're kind of in what kind of
game you're playing that may or may not
be good for you and with a fast toggle
like that doesn't really matter then
there's the four button control panel on
the bottom button one is a remapping
button so you can press and hold this
and then press the button that you want
to remap so like one of the hyper
response buttons for the shoulder
buttons or one of the triggers on the
back you can bind that to another button
on the controller the one beside that is
a profile switch there's three different
profiles the first one is the default
profile that has none of the custom
razor buttons bound to anything so if
it's like the first time you're trying a
game you don't want to accidentally
press the button you don't know what
it's going to do you go back to the
default profile then figure things out
later on the second two profiles are set
as whatever you really want them to be
so you can have the trigger on the back
as a or whatever you want to bind things
to those go on the second two profiles
the third button is a mic mute and the
fourth button is a game chat balance and
volume switch so one press increases the
maximum volume by about 20% a Preston
hold and then pressing the left and
right buttons on the d-pad moves the
chat balance in your headphones or
speakers
and then a press and hold and then up
and down on the d-pad increases or
lowers respectively the master volume
also in that controller box there's that
input headphone jack for your headset
and one interesting thing about this
compared to the elite controller that I
was told is that the elite controller is
actually kind of heavy the stock Xbox
one controller weighs 262 grams the
elite controller weighs 384 grams and
the Wildcat weighs less than both of
them at 260 grams I'm not necessarily
sure if this is something you
personally as the viewers going to care
about but if you do get weary and tired
of heavy controllers something to take
note of it's actually very light and has
additional features over the stock
controller now to be fair I haven't had
a ton of time with it but one thing that
I do have to say is I have experience
with the anza and the saber-tooth fairly
extensively this feels a lot more like
the saber-tooth which is good I tried
the Anza back in the day and it was a
cool controller but I did have some
gripes with it and honestly overall I
really liked the saber-tooth there was a
few things that I wasn't 100% keen on
but that's probably true about every
single product that I've ever used and
this one improved the things that I
wasn't super keen on and moved on from
there so pretty cool actually
