brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so we're meeting in like a
sketchy parking lot in downtown Las
Vegas these guys are like they've got
their booth running out of the back of a
hatchback over here not sketch you guys
at all and this is what we're checking
out this is the Z board to blue edition
they're going to have a new IndieGoGo
campaign up very shortly with a blue
Edition in Pearl Edition so the Pearl is
going to have a dark deck with white
wheels and the blue has blue wheels and
a light deck and they've actually got
some differences in terms of specs as
well they both have 20 mile per hour top
speeds which is more that's more than
the San Francisco special that I
reviewed isn't it so the regular Z board
is going to be more than their previous
special edition in terms of top speed
they also have reductions in weight with
the Z board blue being 40% lighter than
the original Z board so that's at 16
pounds whereas the Pearl Edition is
going to be 20 pounds but come with
additional range so it's actually an 18
mile rate 16 mile range on this one and
24 miles on the Pearl Edition now this
does come with a bit of a price increase
but Z board ones will still be available
and I think for those of you who are
interested in electric skateboard the Z
board to range is going to have some
pretty appealing features so feature
number one I'm holding it my San
Francisco special I can barely lift the
damn thing with one hand whereas this
one the difference in weight is
astonishing the fact that they've
managed to achieve the same or better
range with a weight reduction like this
in a couple of years which is as long as
they've been doing business is
outstanding and they've done this in a
number of ways number one the deck is
thinner and significantly lighter it
also has an upgraded design so you can
see right here that the pads are much
much larger they don't rise up as much
out of the board and you can't see this
but they are actually significantly more
sensitive when you're riding on it
something that I do have a little bit of
trouble with especially when I'm
fumbling for the brakes on my San
Francisco special the handles are also
this one's a little bit rough but
they're curved so that you can easily
lift the thing around you can see the
weight distribution doesn't drive the
edge of the
bored into my leg when I'm holding it so
much and that is because the battery
itself has also been significantly
reduced in weight and it's also really
darn slim too so I I was joking that the
bottom of my san francisco special is
like covered in marks for me bottoming
out on it looks like it'll be much less
of an issue with this bad boy right here
so there you go much thinner battery
more range faster all these are good
things all right the urethane wheels so
the urethane wheels that are available
as an optional upgrade on the Z board
one I actually haven't gotten my hands
on any yet but apparently they give a
smoother ride more speed and more range
those are going to be standard on Z
board too we now get a brushless motor
instead of a brushed DC motor so that
added some additional controller
complexity as well as more wiring to the
unit rear lights and front lights are
now both standard and controllable so
you go ahead and click this button right
here to switch between solid blinking
and I think there's one other mode off
yeah those are the three modes from
other things powered on it's got more
standard trucks so you actually get us a
bit of a weight savings there as well so
they're eight millimeter diameter for
the axles themselves versus 10
millimeter which is more of kind of an
off-road spec and that's what we saw in
the original Z boards they are wait am I
allowed to talk about that you're
working on splash splash resistance well
I whether I'm allowed to talk about it
or not there's a connector on the bottom
that has been repositioned and is now a
water resistant connector although I
can't speak to the rest of the board I'm
sure they still have some work to do on
that and I feel like I must I must be
missing something because there is so
much that they've changed about this guy
I think that is that pretty much it did
we get it oh and it charges faster you
guys didn't even tell me that 90 minute
charge that's outstanding so now instead
of it being kind of suitable for going
to work and then leaving on the charger
all day you could actually just go hang
out out of buddies leave it on the
charger for an hour and a half and then
you're gonna have a full charge when
you're ready to go which reminds me yes
there's actually a battery life
indicator the LED and the power button
changes color now to tell you how much
charge you have left so I am super
excited to hopefully get my hands on one
of these and try it out for you guys in
a full review but in the meantime well
