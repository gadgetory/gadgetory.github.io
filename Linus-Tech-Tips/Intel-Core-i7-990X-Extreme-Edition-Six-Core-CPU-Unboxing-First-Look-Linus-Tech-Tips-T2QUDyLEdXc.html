fastest desktop processor on the planet
this is the Intel Core i7 990 X yes this
is the very same one that an extreme
overclocker recently took well no it's
not the very same one this is a retail
sealed box but it's the same CPU model
that an overclocker famous one recently
took to over seven gigahertz using
extreme cooling methods so this is
Intel's
fastest clock six core to date it is
fully unlocked for all the overclocking
you could possibly want to do and I am
breaking the seal on it so that I can
open it up and show you guys the 990 X
in all of its glory
so the 990 X actually doesn't change a
whole lot over the older 980 X it comes
in at the same price point so that is
about $1000 distribution cost so means
you'll see it marked up however much
from your local retail or your or your
local a tailor and whatever country you
happen to be in okay it includes some
thermal paste which we'll get to later
the clock speeds of this processor at
stock is three point four six gigahertz
now remember that that also support it
supports every technology Intel can
possibly throw at a CPU so you've got 12
Meg's of cache hyper threading so that
means you've got 12 threaded performance
okay you've also got support for turbo
boost and obviously virtualization let
me see it does not have onboard video
because this is an LGA 1366 socket CPU
so that means you do have support for
triple channel memory and it is going to
run on the x58 Express chipset graphics
card is required yeah see I mentioned
that no graphics I'm surprised they
actually have that on the box you're
buying extreme edition processor no
graphics card very random three year
warranty as with all Intel CPUs and I
think that's about all that I wanted to
cover on the box so let's see what we
got inside here we have some thermal
paste okay which you can cut and then
apply it's probably pretty good stuff
from Dow Corning thermally conductive
compound great
okay next we have a core i7 processor
extreme edition installation
instructions through your limited
warranty an Intel Inside logo label
which is right there
very nice you fix one of those to the
outside of your PC and everyone knows
you have an Extreme Edition processor
inside alright let's have a look at the
stock heatsink that is included it looks
like the stock heatsink hasn't changed
since the 980 X so it is a tower
heatsink although the way intel has
designed it is they've put a finger
guard on it which is good and then they
have also designed it you see right here
how these blades actually go a lot lower
than the fins then the cooling fins that
is so that and you can also see the
shape of the blades is not necessarily
to blow air just that way but also to
blow air kind of out the reason for that
is down here at the bottom the fan is
actually going to generate a lot of
turbulence a lot of sort of random
airflow around the CPU socket that
ensures that even if your CPU are even
if your motherboard uses like heat pipe
design to carry all of the heat from the
chipsets up to the PWM the power
delivery you're going to get enough
incidental airflow to cool everything
from this heatsink without using a
downward blowing design so it has four
heat pipes uses a plastic very very
rigid backplate does not have pre
applied thermal compound so that is why
they do include that thermal compound
and it has a rather ingenious mounting
system so you can actually you're using
screws so you're using a bolt through
mounting system you can access these
ones through here cameraman through here
and then the ones at the back you can
see they're covered you can see they're
actually covered by the heatsink so
that's okay because you can use this
hole in a long screwdriver in order to
screw those in okay so up at the top you
got an Intel logo you got a quiet mode
as well as a performance mode for the
fan on here this is by the look of
things a 92 millimeter fan or book could
be could be a hundred mil how big is
this 110 110 mill correct me if I'm
wrong but I think that's what that part
number means so either way it is a high
performance fan it actually spins up
quite loud if you max it out I have used
it in the past but if you put in quiet
mode you shouldn't really run into too
many problems with that here we'll go
ahead
I guess we'll throw this how do I get
the CPU up I haven't actually seen this
this retail box before don't think can I
pull it up this way no can we fill this
out first and then get it ah there we go
okay so there it is the 990 X the
thousand plus dollar CPU the fastest
performing desktop CPU on the planet it
is as I mentioned before an LGA 1366
processor with 12 Meg's of cache 3.4
gigahertz stock speed and it is 100%
overclocking friendly basically if you
buy one of these and you don't overclock
it then I will personally write you a
very angry letter there's the bottom so
there's 1336 pads that will make contact
with your motherboard so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the core i7
990 X fastest processor for a desktop
and don't worry I won't actually write
you an angry letter if you buy one and
don't overclock it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
