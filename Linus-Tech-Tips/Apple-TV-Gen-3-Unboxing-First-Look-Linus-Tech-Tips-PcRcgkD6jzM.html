welcome to Linus tech tips and a big
awesome dislike button go ahead and hit
it for the Apple TV generation 3 so this
is the first Apple unboxing I've done in
quite a while and I am pretty excited to
check this out because it supports great
Apple features like airplay from my
iPhone and my iPad onto my Apple HD TV
no actually they don't have a TV I've
never really materialized that was sort
of disappointing about that more from a
curiosity standpoint than anything else
so the gen 3 player is the main
advantage is airplay so it does have
wireless end which allows you to mirror
the display on your other device whether
it's a Gen 2 or up iPad or an iPhone 4
or up which happens to be exactly the
iPhone 4 on the iPad that I have and
that is what I need it for because I
need to do a demo using it and mirroring
from an iOS device so that's why I
bought it I'm aware there's no jailbreak
I'm aware that you can't run a bunch of
different apps on it because Apple's
really locked down what you can run on
this device through the App Store and
the jailbreak keeps being promised but
it hasn't really materialized and all
that good stuff so what is it got it's
got a single core a5 processor it
supports 1080p unlike the previous
generation Apple TV it has support for
Netflix YouTube Vimeo Hulu actually just
got an update with apples 6 point
something point 3 iOS update so that's
that's pretty cool supports wireless 10
or 10 hundred in Ethernet and it was a
hundred and nine dollars and 99 cents
which makes it more expensive than
something like a Pivo Co s-- which is in
a similar size sort of a form factor and
does offer quite a lot of functionality
using XBMC as well as as Android 4 for
the OS so you can actually use XBMC on
top of Android on that device or you can
use XBMC running natively on that device
and this is actually supposed to be an
apple TV unboxing not a pillows is
unboxing so I'm not gonna talk about it
too much more but you should check it
out if you haven't already I know the
guy who runs pillows actually a really
good guy so anyway here's Apple's remote
which is much less functional than the
than the optional air mouse remote
that's available with the zyo sizing
area I'm talking about it again which
has like an onscreen pointer that you
can kind of go like this so this is just
your basic right left up down menu play
and pause it's got a metal finish to it
which is nicer than the Zayas one it
actually feels like really good but the
disadvantage is something like this is
it could easily get lost in a couch
cushion or you know in a blanket or in
like a butt crack or anything it could
actually easily fit in any of those
things so you know cleavage so we're
gonna go ahead and take off the
protective cover Apple knows that this
device is way too glossy and is bound to
get scratch so they go ahead and cover
that up for you
it's constructions very nice I mean I'll
do my trademark iPhone size comparison
here guys not gonna be doing that for
long gonna be switching to the HTC One
really really soon for my smartphone I'm
already carrying it around and
installing some apps on it so I'm almost
ready to go the bottom has a non-slip
rubber now it's not really non-slip at
all is it that's a shame okay well the
bottom has an Apple logo which makes it
higher performance and the top has an
Apple logo which actually gives it
double the performance of other media
players enabling it to run 1080p which
is basically space-age technology over
HDMI so at the back we've got just a
simple power in HDMI micro USB which you
can use to sync to your Mac or your
other computer or whatever else
an optical audio out which I actually do
like to see you know what this is
probably like the number one thing that
I was really surprised about on this
because there's some media players that
only support HDMI out which is great if
you have a receiver that supports audio
over HDMI but if you have an older
receiver it might still be expensive it
might still be a great receiver with
great amp and all that kind of stuff and
it doesn't support audio over HDMI then
you're pretty much boned so it's nice to
have that optical there's your ten
hundred Ethernet and I think that's
pretty much it thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the
Apple TV
