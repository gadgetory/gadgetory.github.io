done Thank You Colton I appreciate the
help
it was great it was great we have
awesome news this week I'm sure you guys
know of at least some of it there's been
the crazy battlefield controversy going
on why do I keep something a battlefield
the crazy battlefront controversy going
on with the like most downloaded comment
of all time on reddit and all this other
stuff we are of course going to talk
about that but there's also some other
crazy things new too like the Firefox
hardware survey has some interesting
nuggets of information for us so we're
gonna analyze later on and face ID
hacked in the first week BAM
suck at Apple oh oh this is not good for
anybody except the people who did it
I guess yeah and if you're watching last
night Tesla unveiled finally their semi
truck and a surprise the second
iteration of their roadster yeah their
original vehicle yeah new fastest car
ever fastest production car of all time
super epic intro it's there we go
almost
the Wanko
Carl
so tag thank you a one-in-three chance
no taxi box system enter to win heck
yeah Mac well then 20% off I fix it
protect tool kit why not you where we go
BAM we're back and just right into it
with the battlefront news I think that's
deviously actually I'm gonna cut in
slightly before this shameless
self-promotion big charity stream
happening tomorrow 24 hours on my twitch
channel switch ITV slash Luke underscore
life are going at least 24 hours I think
it's supposed to be like 27 hours doing
a whole bunch of different games one
game per hour iterating every year buh
buh blah blah blah show I mean dude help
support extra life it's gonna be awesome
okay bye anyways next or be mean or just
enjoy your day in some other way
um Battlefront crazy stuff happening
there's a post on reddit we're gonna
show it here right now the reddit post
was talking about how it takes 40 hours
to unlock a hero they talk about a bunch
of different stuff the post has been
updated a few times actually been very
well taken care of by the hotter potato
this has been nuts if you've been on the
internet this week almost at all even if
you're not that into gaming you have
probably heard about this there's huge
controversies where countries like
Belgium are considering classifying
different games as gambling online
gambling because of how loot boxes are
being handled because this post has
gotten so big that it has gotten to
people that manage laws in countries
which is pretty crazy but congressmen
are being contacted about this like it's
it's blown up to a ludicrous degree
which is good or bad depending on your
stance probably bad let's start at the
beginning yeah so the beginning is this
post and then what really blew it up is
the developer responding which usually
makes things better it's super did not
I'm sure a lot of this is the same old
same old from what you guys have heard
so before we get into their response why
don't we ever learn what happened to
begin with it was basically everyone
getting yes super super duper mad
because the new Star Wars Battlefront 2
game from EA which is a flagship title
that cost 80 bucks yes also has heavily
these pay2win game mechanics so how that
kind of works and I played in the beta
and I started to feel it as well is a
lot of games have loot boxes you've got
overwatch where you get a bunch of
different skins or portraits or whatever
shadow of war had some issues here as
well where it could really help you with
your gameplay but I beat on the hardest
difficulty without using any of them
that's not a brag a lot of people did
this it's not that difficult of a game
and it's not that big of a deal this is
where it became a big problem this is a
multiplayer game and they directly give
you extremely powerful advantages
against your enemy not just aesthetic
skins stuff like that like overall no
yeah like directly power you are better
you do more damage you regen more health
you have more health you lock onto
targets faster you don't get locked onto
as fast these types of things but surely
you can achieve those things from just
playing the game and not spending money
yes but it takes a ludicrous amount of
time how much time I don't know the
exact hours but I think someone
calculated it as like this is over six
months it's 40 hours to unlock a hero
but there's other stuff as well like the
the hero that's definitely part of it
and you can't get Vader without playing
the game for 40 hours which is
ridiculous because most people aren't
gonna play the game for 40 hours no
player or like just the game the game
it's it's how it's balanced is not based
on skill which is another thing that's
pissing people off if you do really
really well in a round and you kill a
ton of people you're not gonna get that
many more credits than someone who just
played for the same amount of time that
you did okay which is bugging a lot of
people which sounds like seven
money-making business package yeah
because you have to pour a huge amount
of time in like 40 hours to unlock
something like a hero the party that
bugs me even more than the hero part the
hero part is just it hits that 40 hour
number so it's easily digestable yeah
okay um the cards you get these
different cards that you put on your
character they give you different
bonuses okay say you're playing the
spaceship combat mode I'm in a bomber
you're in a TIE fighter I've spent a
whole bunch of money on the game just
money man tossing it all over the place
I have something that makes it so that I
lock on to targets 200% faster oh also
my bombs do increase damage and I move
fast
you don't have any cards you just
started the game you just launched up
you were just fighting another bomber
you're in a fighter you're able to get
away from them and get out you're like
sick ok I got this new move I spin and
list slightly to the left and everything
works out great you try to do the same
thing against me I lock on to you 200%
faster you can't get out of the way I
can't
you're dead yeah okay that directly
strongly affected gameplay based on card
advantages now to get to the top two
there's different tiers of these cards
as well to get to the top tier of cards
you kind of have to craft your way up
the easiest way to get crafting
materials as loot boxes these easiest
way to craft you two you're up to the
top card is loot boxes people who spend
money will be directly better at online
competitive modes because of this and
it's lots of money from remember quickly
if you want to unlock everything like
top tier of every card in all the heroes
it's like 20 100 dollars or something
that's I'm saying that I've talked my
head I don't remember exact but it's not
like even a realistic thing that anyone
would want to do or realistic that's the
thing yes it absolutely is if you look
into the game industry right now
especially the mobile side which of the
guys that have been doing more of this
kind of like loot box pay2win mechanics
it hasn't been in a lot of full price
games because that's ridiculous that's
the whole controversy like do you think
people get as mad if this game was
free-to-play no pay2win I don't think
they'd be nearly as you already paid 80
bucks yeah so what they're targeting is
what's called in the gaming industries
whales right it's small amounts of
people I've heard people I know
PewDiePie in his video said 10% I doubt
it's anywhere near that high I'm gonna
go with one percent or lower of players
will spend a ludicrous amount of money
these are the guys that will play a
mobile game and just be like I'm gonna
spend thousands and thousands and
thousands of dollars not to wreck all of
you literally thousands I spoke to when
I was traveling I met some people from
Silicon Valley who worked in the
industry and they said they had a very
small percentage of users who had spent
over a hundred thousand dollars just on
on that mobile app yep insane absolutely
nuts and there are definitely lots of
people that will spend that $2,100 to on
day one Oh have a huge advantage on
everyone else that also makes it that
you've also put in cheats like is it
yeah
godmode it's not quite god mode but it
is a noticeable advantage and the
biggest issue for me is it creates a
concept in the game where when someone
kills you
you can legitimately say that it was
because of something that wasn't skill
yeah you can you can lose be like
overpowered that's ember and he just
spent more money on the game that's why
he won and you might not be wrong which
is ridiculous I like that in lots of
games where you're like oh that guns
just overpowered the response from
pretty much everyone else is gonna be
like Haven use it or like find a way to
counter it get good something like that
in this game you could be like he just
spent more money what can I do and
that's a legitimate stance and that is
ridiculous I shouldn't be able to be
legitimate stance but it has been made
so by the developers and it's ridiculous
because of one of the statements that
they said in this official post on which
I'm going to jump back to here which
drives me absolutely insane it drove the
entire internet insane and I'm sure
you've all heard this but where is it
did it today and you really mean it this
is like a record breaking oh yeah record
breaking Java it says right now negative
twenty point nine thousand but it's way
more than that I don't know what
happened it must have been on a slope or
autocorrected curve whatever but I saw
it personally at over six hundred
thousand and I'm sure it was higher than
that at some point in time but yeah
let's see here will continuously adjust
our progression mechanics to give
players a sense of accomplishment as
they all as they explore all of
battlefront - that has driven everyone
nuts because the sense of accomplishment
isn't skill it's not doing better at the
game gives you more credits it's
spending more time on the game gives you
more credits and you can just skip all
of that and have a sense of freaking
accomplishment by paying a whole bunch
of money into the game and
instantaneously being better than
everyone removing other people's sense
of accomplishment by squishing on them
with your cash because you bought better
freakin cards or heroes or whatever the
question I have is when you come into
this as a new who hasn't spent anything
yet and you get absolutely demolished by
someone who has are you just gonna put
the game down and not play it anymore or
are you gonna be motivated to spend
their obviously banking on the ladder
but what
spending is actually gonna happen for
people I think it's gonna be a little
bit of both if you have this is the the
frustrating situation you have right
here if you have a group of friends and
some people are saying yeah it's I think
it was a slightly different quote I
don't know if it was from a different
poster this is one has been edited or
what but I think it was slightly
different anyways if you have a group of
friends that all play games together you
guys have been playing a game games
together since high school or something
and two out of six of the friends start
playing battlefront all right you
normally play a game all together but
these guys want to play battlefront they
just bought it then maybe one or two
more guys buy battlefront because they
were playing the last two guys are gonna
cave because four or six have it anyways
it's very easy if a couple people in
groups start playing a game that
everyone will eventually play it cuz
everyone just wants to play together in
something new and shiny that's great now
you're all playing together but Jim and
Larry don't have as much time they spend
more time at work they're great gamers
they're great in your crew you love
having them there but they don't have as
much time so to make up for the time
they're gonna spend money on the game
even though they're great gamers they're
topping score charts and everything they
could normally make up the time by
getting more credits and just doing
better in the game so something like
counter-strike it doesn't matter at all
because they don't care if they don't
have the fancy skins they still get the
same freaking gun
yes um they're like overwatch it doesn't
matter they don't care if they don't
look as cool they have the same heroes
everything's fine or even in destiny
they just scale it they just scale it
and in destiny you there's loot boxes
sort of bright engrams but they just
give you aesthetic items and it doesn't
really matter these are games where you
can catch up through skill or catch up
because there's nothing to catch up on
mm-hmm instead of oh I'm gonna catch up
by spending money that is my mechanic to
catch up to us I realize there is this
time issue it's almost completely
separate from the money issue it's yeah
well that's the big problem is they kind
of work together the money issue almost
as like alleviates the time issue but
that's some sicko that's like Dominic
though yeah yeah so like the problem I
have is cuz let's take a look at my
brother my brother works a lot and has
crazy work hours because he he drives
truck for
movie production companies so they work
two crazy hours of the night they work
crazy long hours in general and usually
get on for a specific show and they want
to film that entire show right so for
the duration of that show you're working
nutso amount of hours if he wants to
play a game like this it's very likely
that it would make logical sense I'm not
saying he's going to I'm not saying he's
not going to but it would make logical
sense for him to buy some boxes so he
can catch up to the rest of us that
would be able to play more mm-hmm
if we were playing this game that makes
sense for him the problem is that the
game is based around that yeah and it is
trying to push people to do that if
gaming companies start making money
they'll try to find ways that make more
money
yeah so the time and money thing are
mutually reinforcing yeah yeah the thing
about back there's a question of like if
you are more likely to just stop playing
versus more likely to spend money in
order to not get squashed you already
have this sunk cost of 80 80 bucks
that's a big issue too and like oh it's
free you could walk away yeah oh if I
just spend 10 more bucks I'll have more
fun but then it's gambling which is
another huge issue so you spend 10 more
bucks and maybe you want to play the
heavy class in the ground war game
instead of the space game or whatever
you want to play let's just go with the
heavy class and you don't get any of the
cards that you want for the heavy class
you already spent your 10 bucks it's
gone you didn't get any because the
cards limited loot boxes and the loot
boxes are random so it's gambling cuz
maybe now you have to spend more you
don't know I like playing the bomber in
the star fighting game thing I played in
the beta I only want cards for the
bomber I play the bomber on both sides I
play the tie bomber and I play the a
wing I if I don't get cards to the
bomber I'm just gonna want more loot
boxes it's gambling you can craft cards
too yeah and you can craft someone just
in the chat just said you can craft
cards to great people who spend money in
the game will be able to craft more
cards because they'll have more
materials from the other cards and the
more you play the game if I played that
spaceship combat game for enough time I
would eventually want to branch out of
just fighting with the bomber ship it's
not necessarily true for everyone or
y-wing sorry it's not necessarily true
for a wings a little fast one sorry it's
not necessary true for everybody but a
lot of people including myself are going
to want to play
then they'll want cards for other things
then you're running out of crafting
materials then it cost $2,100 to get all
of the cards in the game because now you
actually enjoy the game because you
spent $80 and it's the only game you
bought this season maybe it's just
frustrating because now that it's here
they're building the game around it
that's one thing that I actually
defended shadow of war with is when
playing shadow war it didn't feel like
they had built the game around the idea
of the loot boxes the loot boxes gave
you money they gave you some followers
but the entire game it's like smashed in
your face that there's these no not
shadow for now it's smashing your face
that there are these orcs all over the
place and you just need to press the one
button and it actually ends the combat
faster if you want to recruit them so
like it the game gives you these orcs
all the time so it's not that big of a
deal I didn't mind it that much it
didn't feel like the game was designed
around it Battlefront absolutely
absolutely battlefront 2 feels like it
was designed around the idea of the loot
boxes instead of the other way around
which is bad this is very bad so we
haven't even got to the news portion
which is the new lock that after a
brutal AMA where they just made everyone
even more mad either question dodging
and brutal unsatisfactory answers they
made another determination which was for
now they're just gonna turn off all of
it all the ability to purchase crystals
in in-game will now be completely off
it's offline and John told me that
actually if you go to the the interface
where you go to buy these crystals
instead of just removing the button and
not letting you go into that area you
can click the button and it brings it
just like a random janky blank page
maybe people on the check and confirm or
deny this but that's I haven't seen that
I don't I don't have it some of the chat
said Luke won't be streaming battlefront
2 technically I will be streaming
battlefront 2 I'll be streaming
battlefront 2 tomorrow it'll just be the
original one because I'm playing games
throughout the years so I don't remember
what your the original battlefront 2
came out in but I'm playing it for that
year so it's gonna be all pixelated and
wonky and fun so fun I was involved fun
there's no loot boxes it's great 2007
apparently
what No maybe it's not 2007 so thing to
note about them turning off this this
game mechanic for the buying is that
they didn't remove it they've just
turned it off and they say the ability
to purchase crystals in-game will become
available at a later date
once EA has made changes to the game so
it's funny because the internet seems to
lag here a little bit it felt like if
you if you pile everyone which isn't
fair it's not fair I understand if you
pile everyone on the Internet into one
little hive mind bubble hmm they read
the first part and then about an hour or
two later read the second part because
the whole internet rejoice like we did
it reddit we we won they took
microtransactions out accomplished and
then like starting about half an hour to
an hour later it started kind of
bubbling up and then by two hours later
it had passed posts about the original
happiness yeah that oh my goodness
they're just putting the
microtransactions back in the game and
they called it the wait what inning yeah
so like it's it's frustrating because
this is so transparent they're trying to
get this huge wave of people that are
refunding the game like me to rebuy it
play it long enough that now they're
invested maybe they have a group of
friends that play or I don't know how
the great game guarantee works on origin
I know that I played for zero hours so I
was zero minutes zero seconds whatever
so I was able so they're gonna wait til
that expires I think so but I don't know
if that matters I don't know how the
great game guarantee works but they're
trying to they're gonna wait til people
are kind of stuck in it or can't refund
it or whatever and then they'll put
microtransactions back in they'll make
their money off their whales and they'll
move on I'm sure that the
microtransactions I'm sure it's gonna be
they're gonna adjust it so you don't
have to do so much work the disparity
won't be so huge okay there is a huge
issue there as well did you hear about
this
so they reduced the cost of Heroes but
the right they do that in the amount of
credits that you get that's right
so they basically just it was the same
basically they did two different moves
that were both two-faced non moves yeah
they were like hey we reduced the cost
of yours by the way we also reduce the
amount of credits you get don't worry
about it right and then they're like hey
we removed microtransactions to the game
by the way they're also coming back
don't worry about it so it was like a
hero used to be a grand but you start
with a hundred bucks now a hero is only
a hundred bucks but you start with ten
bucks yeah essentially so I guess this
controversy just got so bad that they
were actually afraid of losing their
launch day sales like that upfront $80
yes that was gonna get so heavily eroded
that you're like okay we can't sacrifice
that and I wonder at some point because
like a lot of these moves are so dense
like a sense of accomplishment when
you're answering a spot a a post which
its title is it takes 40 hours to unlock
a hero and you can just buy it like
that's so obviously not the right way to
respond to that I seriously wonder at
some degree if this isn't just any press
is good press because now every single
gamer definitely knows about battlefront
every single mom and dad knows
battlefront is around now this is too
too bad too bad too bad usually when
companies take that strategy on they
only alienate people who weren't gonna
get their product anyway you know what I
mean yeah someone in the chat Oh Neha KJ
I think I probably butchered that name
I'm sorry said Disney CEO literally
called up the EA CEO and told them to
remove the option to pay for loot boxes
because Disney started getting Kraft for
purchasing which is mechanics towards
children I haven't seen anything about
that at all if I heard did that be very
badass where he's just like looking out
for a bro it's like yo this is not going
well for us don't do it yeah I I don't
know I haven't heard anything about that
but it's it is pretty brutal there are
people who have been posting examples of
like the
Disney star wars XD shows the animated
ones where it's like a show about how
gambling is bad based in the Star Wars
universe it's like a part of the Star
Wars show I think it's rebels and it's
about how gambling is bad and then they
have a Star Wars game that has gambling
in it and you can say as much as you
want like this isn't a kids game kids
are gonna play it like our generation we
played I'm assuming you did as well yeah
I thought our games pretty early on
Grand Theft Auto was one of the ones
that my parents were like I played it a
little bit like friends houses and they
knew and they didn't care but like okay
like halo I was in there pretty early on
counter-strike I was in there quite
early as anything goes and I grew up
like the thing is now it's our
generation and a little bit above that
are starting to have welfare a bit above
I guess that are starting to have kids
at these ages that were you're talking
about where they might watch something
like Disney XD you think our generation
that grew up with like shooter games is
gonna care too much if someone plays
battlefront which is like pretty
innocent for a shooter game oh yeah
like can you can you chop people up your
lightsaber humans not okey I think it
goes through them I don't think they
split in half they just like fall over
yeah cuz like ever since I was eight I
wanted to be able to just totally do
people that hard ribbons yeah I'm not
sure I could be wrong on that if you
can't do that then like that's like I
don't know kids are absolutely gonna be
playing this game it doesn't matter that
it's ers are berated whatever I don't
even know what it is might be em I don't
know what they are look at them there's
no ways what is what is the normal
rating T okay that makes sense teen
whatever kids are definitely gonna be
playing it and gambling's in it and like
a gambling mechanic that makes you
better at the game isn't it and that's
bad because kids always want to be
better there's always that kid in your
school that was like my shoes make me
run faster now there's gonna be some kid
being like I have a better card from a
ship I'm better than you
yeah that's I could see kids at school
being like use your scrub yeah yeah I
bet they don't place a scrub anymore
they should bring it back to the route
and pretty cool as far as I'm lazy James
thinks you should bring scrub back yeah
I know we've talked about this topic for
a long time but it is pretty important
we can get out of it though we're pretty
good we're pretty done aren't we yeah I
guess I'll talk about like the aftermath
and kind of what to do and stuff so a
lot of people been bringing this to
local representatives because they're
trying to get loot boxes and games
classified as gambling
I do think personally that something
needs to happen I'm a little bit worried
about how far seeing things in games as
gambling could go because like
randomized loot off of a monster that
you have to farm by spending more time
in the game where a game is
subscription-based might be seen as
gambling slippery slope so it depends
where it ends but something needs to
happen and loot boxes are just horrible
so maybe contact your local authorities
to some degree well I can tell you the
language that the Belgium Commission was
using yeah the Belgian gambling
Commission is investigating Battlefront
about because the loot boxes and what
they said was loot crate's that you
purchase without knowing what's inside
can be considered gambling because your
ability to succeed in the game is
dependent on chance and therefore it's a
game of chance and if it's a game of
chance so in that permit so if that
individual item is purchased and it's a
random chance that's that's a good way
to define it because I don't want to
screw with like random chance that is
inherently built within games well I
think that the emphasis here though in
my interpretation anyway is that your
success in the game really depends on it
yeah see that anyway this is probably
not a conversation to bother have on LAN
show but that's where like like if you
get a legendary item in world of
warcraft your success in the game could
be based around getting that it affects
your success for sure but like but it's
not but it's not a loot crate and it's a
totally different style of system and
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba pretty should be pretty
easy to divide between I don't think
it's actually gonna be a problem so
let's move on
tough topic yeah how about that face ID
that iPhone X yeah let's jump to that
yeah
oh they did it so how did how did it
happen is that it's so awesome if you
bring up the pictures of this mask it's
actually a YouTube video you can play
that YouTube video just put the sound
office up hills anyway yeah it's one of
those what the heck okay I'm gonna show
security researchers in Vietnam have
cracked apples new face ID using a
composite mask consisting of a silicon
nose literally paper cutout 2d eyes
mounted on a plastic frame that they 3d
printed okay so that's this is no good
this is not it well there's like I've
won like a two-minute video oh no this
is 51 minutes I was like maybe I can
find them I think it's linked from the
forum thread
okay good music so the caveat here is
like even though this mask only took
fifty bucks to make they did have to
actually scan the the victims face with
like a face scanner so that's kind of
integral to it but other than that the
eyes were actually just printed out
paper and it's a simple silicon nose
silicon nose getting a scan of someone's
face is gonna be not that easy what did
they have to scan it with they used a
handheld like dedicated scanner but they
say that in there that's gonna yeah in
the future you might be able to use one
of those just like cell phone ones yeah
or even just construct the image with
with images like just use the images to
make them on yeah okay because if you
could be like sitting across the table
at dinner with someone and oh I'm just
telling the boss or like yeah and
inadvertently get someone's you have to
go around them but right yeah so not
that far because they just have the
white meshing on on most of the sides so
he just used that thing to unlock like
if you look at it the size of the thing
I show the front at some point here but
there's a there's a couple things about
this number one is it's hilarious
because at launch Apple said that it
worked with professional mask makers and
makeup artist in Hollywood to make sure
that masks couldn't be used to hack face
ID
and these like random dudes have already
done it with something that doesn't look
all that professional well that's the
other things especially the eyes it's
literally just printed out in like his
face a picture of his face they cut out
the eyes from that picture and put it on
to this like mannequin head that's wild
and the reason that's especially
interesting is because people thought
from the patents that Apple took out
that eye movement factored in to face ID
but this would suggest otherwise and if
I move Minh doesn't factor in to face ID
then that means that you can use
potentially someone who is unconscious
knocked out or even dead to unlock a
fault which is pretty scary even even
the touch what do they call that touch
ID yeah yeah even they're super crazy
even touch ID which Apple claims is like
an order of magnitude less secure yeah
face ID even that when you had its sense
like the heat of your thumb so if you'd
been dead for more than like a couple
hours or a day they couldn't unlock your
phone you can wotty yeah you can do that
slightly artificially by like external
heating and all this other junk but like
it's it's not that easy it's a lot
harder than just like you know what I
mean like it's yeah it's there's always
gonna be a way to get through some form
of security nothing is 100% secure but
like it's kind of sad this has already
been done and it's kind of it's
interesting because cameras on stuff
like phones are constantly getting
better and they're constantly starting
to implement things like depth scanning
and all this other stuff so we're gonna
get closer and closer progressively to
breaking through this being easier and
easier the security on this get the
worse over time unless they're actively
improving it it doesn't prove itself as
you use it or more and more yeah like
I've heard of people being locked out
when they put their glasses on and it
had yeah when they did the initial scan
they weren't wearing glasses or their
hair wasn't in their face so then it
locks you out you enter your code and
when you enter your code it's like oh
the the model that we just took like you
with glasses on we're gonna add that to
the model now so that's just an
annoyance banning the model but it's not
necessarily making it more secure like
see like the having hair
your face and stuff is just annoying I
don't I don't want to deal with it
because it gets in your eyes and well no
good call but like like with touch ID if
I just like with mine it's not touch ID
but I have a fingerprint sensor on the
back doesn't matter what situation mean
I'd be completely covered in mud if I
just like wipe my finger off real quick
and go burp I get in my phone yo you
still got the passcode and that but like
it's just I don't know but it's pretty
sick that I can t remember the last time
you it's that's still an action that
you're taking right you're deciding
granted that it's muscle memory that you
do automatically after a while yeah
you're still taking an action to unlock
your phone whereas apples is pursuing a
time when you just kind of go like do
not know you don't even do that you're
just like look you like by the time you
look at your phone it's unlocked
that's sick so they're like trying to
get there I guess they should be
aspiring to that that's because that's
optimal use case as long as it's secure
it's not there yet though evidently it's
slower than touch ID which is
frustrating fingerprint is pretty
insecure though yeah it has a lot of
issues too it's like 1 in 50,000 or
something like that yeah it's like I
don't know what your problems with their
methodologies here so the story is
absurdly short-sighted it is there
though cuz some people were saying that
it's possible that when they registered
their face they like had their face
obscured or something like that or tried
to make their face kind of more like the
mask so that they were similar yeah but
they and there hasn't been there's no
way to verify that but the research
researchers did say that they made four
other masks that didn't work and once
those ones failed they rear edge Estate
re-registered their face on the face ID
and that after registering their face
they didn't do any passcode entries to
update it that's what they say yeah I
don't know I if if nothing else all I
really want this to stand for is to
reinforce that anything can be broken
into no one should ever consider
anything absolutely secure this might be
better I don't necessarily think it's
easier
when I go to I always use my phone when
it's in my hand I never go like I'm
gonna look at it what's on the table so
Linus does that we talked about this
once and he was like he hated that the
finger for things were on the back
because he often wants to like just
unlock it when it's on the table yeah I
just heard a lot of boo-hoo-hoo yeah but
that doesn't find me here so like and
it's become a natural part of picking up
the phone to unlock it by the time you
get to it yeah so the speed thing
doesn't help for me personally and face
ideas slow words over there mad cuz he's
an Apple user and he just doesn't know
what it's like to have that fingerprint
reader on the back do you have a ten
gravy baby do you have a ten
no you wish even Apple yeah maybe yeah
maybe it is in I don't know if you guys
can hear that but just in case any of
you missed it that was sarcasm
it's a fantastic tool but yeah I don't
know I I just don't like it for a lot of
reasons personally but if you do like it
that's great
run with it do whatever you want
personal preferences are awesome just do
know that nothing is completely secure
we should also mention that the fact
that you can like scans one's face and
then make a mask and unlock their phone
that's like espionage level packing yeah
like this is more like see they're just
gonna like run by you and grab it or
grab it and then choke hold you and make
your face look at it and then run away
or or steal your phone and go hey is
this your phone and then you look at it
yeah it is and then thanks that would
actually work way to that's pretty good
if a guy with a balaclava comes up this
phone so everyone's gonna have to carry
your own masks so they have to chase
someone who steals their phone they can
put the solution that this is more mask
yes yeah
take those laws away that we can't wear
masks everyone has to wear masks so that
when they go to unlock their phone they
just go huh and then put it back yeah
they just occurred to me that there's
gonna be people in the Middle East who
like wanna
use face unlock did they do they just
not use face unlock didn't you just only
use it at home use a passport your house
code public yeah never thought of it
yeah
moving on anyways last night I got to
watch this awesome livestream
Oh Ellen Musk's it can't be Elon Ellen
must DeGeneres they had a child together
and they hyphenated the last name oh
that like that hurt oh I need a moment
anyways okay so no I know it's Elon yeah
they finally unveiled the semi truck yes
which i think is pretty BA the question
on everyone's mind is when and where are
you gonna be able to make these things
given that you're struggling so hard to
produce the Model 3 for the next like
two years and you're spending a billion
dollars per quarter on doing that you
can't just build another gig of fact for
you apparently they're gonna be start
shipping or not shipping they're gonna
start producing the semi truck in 2019
yeah and the new roadster which is gonna
be the fastest car fastest production
car by acceleration in the world
that's 2020 yeah so things could happen
before 2020 and change that claim but as
of right now it theoretically is which
is really cool
there's a lot of really awesome things
about the truck but there are concerns
like you just said how are you gonna
make this I do know they're they're
production lines are constantly
increasing so maybe a theory somewhere
says that they'll be able to actually
make them properly by 2019 maybe one
will be made in 2019 are they making two
more Giga factories as well they're
they're constantly expanding so I I
can't claim to know what is gonna happen
in terms of their production line semi
truck itself is pretty dope though did
you jet it looks cool it looks pretty
cool and it I've been saying for quite a
long time that semi trucks and trucks in
general are going to be
super-important for Tesla because trucks
things that need huge amounts of torque
are gonna benefit from electric engines
a ton now there are some issues coming
from the trucking industry like my my
grandfather his job actually for like
basically ever was financing semi trucks
for people and companies that want to
get into trucking so a super important
detail is costs per kilometer or cost
per mile and they talked about that in
the stream that was a direct call out
for companies and financial institutions
that financed the semi trucks because
they're extremely expensive that was a
direct Hey look at us it's going to be
easier to get loans because you can
throw this number which is one of the
most important numbers when you're
buying a truck that is it is cheaper per
kilometer you can also throw in numbers
like the truck is guaranteed for
whatever amount of distance if you have
a breakdown
it's it's some ridiculous number if oh
yeah yeah what was that if you have a oh
yeah what happened was it's got four
separate independent engines and two of
them break down and you can still go
like four hundred miles or something
like that yeah it's it's not in this
document okay by the way speaking of
price they did not mention an absolute
price at all they only know price per
mile which they put at 20% cheaper again
it was only relative 20 percent cheaper
than a comparable diesel truck it
includes the cost of the they're not
just talking about the truck they're
talking about like a the entire thing I
can just buying it and Sharon is
moderating it me and maintenance you
know maintenance is gonna be a big
reason why that number is lower yeah
yeah because gonna put that out there
right now another huge issues only goes
500 miles on one charge the only there
is probably not properly placed someone
in chat said only most trucking routes
are able to be there and back within
that time and truckers are mended
mandated to take breaks that is a huge
deal in I know North America I don't
know outside of that you have to take
breaks and that is within the amount of
distance that you would be able to
reasonably travel within when your
breaks easily your break has to be half
our during the break it can charge for
500 miles of further just 400 400 miles
of further distance during that break
and you be able to keep going that's not
really a major point as long as they
actually have the I think they're called
super charging station I think actually
he dropped Megatron a good charger yeah
Megatron's like it's gonna be like a
separate kind of network I'm thinking
that kind of a same way you drive by a
card lock gas station oh yeah yeah
that's for Sammy's ya have to be like
that I wouldn't be surprised if it was
kind of its own thing so a typical
diesel truck can go a thousand miles on
a full tank do you know how long it
takes to fill up that tank when you're
saying it I think he said 15 minutes no
no I'm talking with like a like a normal
diesel truck oh wow I assumed it would
take a little while it's going to take
longer to charge this truck but one of
his points was that you don't have to
stand there the whole time I guess it is
definitely going to take longer to
charge it but I don't think there's
gonna be a bunch of truck drivers
leaning against the truck while it zips
electricity or gulps I guess electricity
from hugs it from the network I've also
talked about a guaranteed price for four
semi trucks at 7 cents per unit would
that be kilowatt I don't remember
exactly what analyst is that also in
kilowatt that's not on the document
either but he did okay got a guaranteed
price which is a big deal also also a
big deal in terms of getting financial
support for trucks one a big question
that I haven't I'm sure okay I haven't
seen anyone ask it but I am absolutely
certain someone has so and I haven't
looked so that's kind of an issue that I
haven't looked for it but a big problem
is gonna be wait they didn't talk about
it on the street there's a lot of
weighing stations for trucks because
roads can only support a a certain
amount of weight and the batteries are
gonna weigh a lot I did see this yeah
okay naked it is gonna be heavier then
yeah then a naked normal diesel I think
that's gonna be a big issue there's
weighing stations like all over the
place
they did not address that did you see
the cockpit design yeah so it's 500
miles with 32.2 tons of cargo so at max
capacity is that the heaviest class heat
a lot of the stats he gave out were for
the heaviest class of truck like the
speed and the range and everything so
the lack of engine might compensate for
that yeah but like if you look at the
Model S it's actually a pretty heavy car
because the battery and all that other
stuff you have to do more than look at
it you probably have to try to lift it
apparently way stations are for trailer
load and balance not total load oh okay
we have some really we just got everyone
all kinds of now someone said weigh
stations over total weight who knows I
just it wasn't addressed in the stream
and it made me worried a little bit but
this will be huge another big thing that
they brought up was convoy mode this
isn't the first time we've seen convoy
mode I've been in a car that was doing
convoy mode before being in a convoy
but essentially the cost per mile or per
kilometer goes down drastically when you
have these trucks in convoy mode I
believe I don't think he went over it in
exhaustive detail but I believe because
they talked to each other and they can
run really closely together drafting
very efficiently okay so I didn't I
didn't hear this from the stream last
night but it was an article I read today
okay they said that in comm what the
reason convoy mode is so much cheaper in
fact musk said it was cheaper than rail
yes it was because but he didn't show
the rail number well you only need a
driver in the front truck okay yes
that's a thing is that they evil they
even showed it in the animation there
was a person in the front truck there's
no people of nugget once following it
that was a very important note that's
crazy but is that so did they bake in
the cost of the driver
definitely they must have otherwise that
doesn't matter so but I mean in the in
the initial Tesla semi versus diesel
semi comparison well I don't think so
because in the second number when he
said in convoy mode he was comparing
those against the other ones not against
train and he said it was like 80 cents
or something
I would think of that at that comparison
I mean like it's a company they're gonna
make their numbers look as good as they
can I would assume that they'd be like
yeah but it's like you know 2/3 cheaper
because there's only one driver involved
and that is that is a realistic
consideration if you're well yeah mostly
I think I I wonder how they're going to
accomplish this because convoy mode
makes sense for highways which is what
they showed it on it's like you get to
it exactly you're not gonna be like
you're not gonna be able to convoy for
the entire trip yeah you got the turnoff
and what do you do for the rest of the
drivers well they are getting their
enhanced Auto III missed this maybe
twitchchat knows what's going on enhance
auto pilots they're deaf for all of them
yeah and if this is like 1 to 2 years
out maybe it'll be even better by then
then the Elan did not did not avoid
talking about autopilot he brought it up
directly in the stream he said that they
would have all their most modern yeah
that's true but he didn't say that
he may not have what they're saying
doesn't address our question of whether
he said that about convoy mode Oh long
did say that they're all gonna get it
hence to autopilot for sure yeah well in
the video there isn't drivers in the in
the trucks behind the first ok I didn't
notice that so yeah that's good yeah
it's it's it's gonna be interesting does
it have air brakes
I oh it has the he did talk about
breaking a bit because it's never after
it has the regenerative braking so I was
actually out of test another dealership
the other day and I was asking if with
the regenerative braking can you can you
coast just as well as you can cuz me
when I'm driving actually coast quite a
bit yeah and he told me as a person
who's never driven at esli said actually
you can't really coast worth a crop and
the regenerative braking is on a slow
easy down like pretty fast
yeah but the upside of that is he like
barely ever have you over a bridge brake
which is what he said here he didn't say
anything about about air brakes I would
that even work I don't I don't have a
very good understanding of how semi
trucks work
don't think it would work anyways what
about that roadster though the roadster
yeah I guess we can at the end of the
whole semi truck thing it was kind of
like a one more thing moment yeah and
they pop open the hatch and a new Tesla
Roadster drove out of the back of the
trailer that the semi truck was towing
can do 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds it can do
zero to a hundred and I believe 4.9 I
don't see that on here but see that but
I actually I do have a list of linked a
Wikipedia of the fastest zero second
speeds and I was like oh I wonder if
they like killed some records from other
like super expensive cars well they kind
of just beat their own record yeah yeah
it can go 620 miles or a thousand
kilometers on a single charge he was
happy because they broke the thousand
kilometer ceiling which is pretty cool
it seats for production so yeah it's a
2+2 production starts in 2020 the first
1000 cars will cost 250 grand each paid
in full up front who later cars starting
at 2 underground so presumably their
first thousand there they're gonna sell
there it was yeah yeah which makes a lot
of sense I love this quote Elon said and
his stuttering is removed from this
quote is that the point of doing this is
just to give a hardcore smackdown to
gasoline cars driving a gasoline sports
car is gonna feel like a steam engine
with a side of quiche that's wicked that
was pretty funny we'll just take the
voicecrack out of when people quote
yours I love you on I was yeah I was
just kidding he speaks that way because
he uses particular language anyways
moving on to someone in the chat guest
it
sponsors maybe thank you very much heck
yeah I fix it sometimes like I love ads
please please make them show up I fix it
this 59.95 pro tect toolkit it's awesome
as a 64 bit driver kit which is easily
my favorite part and probably the main
stay feature of someone
the driver that's not good is that
awesome yeah it has a ton of other stuff
in it as well including little tweezers
and pry tools and anti-static strap in
which we use here all the time
yeah and suction cups for taking screens
off of things which is a major issue
with very specific devices
esd-safe tweezers even I forgot to
mention that part also if you just want
some awesome free guides on how to fix
things which does include the use of
their kit you can just go to ifixit.com
they have 25,000 free repair guides for
devices they also do repair ability
scores so if you're interested in buying
something you can check into how
repairable it is so you know if it's
gonna have a long life because you
yourself are going to be able to fix it
which is actually really cool they're
like their own movement sort of in like
a culture bringing repair ability and
craftsman traits back to society because
it's kind of faltered a little bit
lately anyways moving on I fixed a
dot-com slash Linus get your protec tool
kit now for 59.95 USD moving on Mac
Walden I am wearing a Mac Weldon shirt
damn damn that's a good shirt but I wish
my shirt that's not Mac Weldon had a
front pocket that I can hang these in I
could now they're on the floor um
anyways Mac Weldon believes in smart
design premium fabrics and simple
shopping which is great it's actually it
is quite a simple shopping experience
which is not too bad
Mac Weldon will be the most comfortable
underwear socks shirts undershirts
hoodies and sweatpants that you will
ever wear mmm wow what a clamp even if
you're not a nudist and you do wear
other stuff yeah this will still be
better yeah they want you to be
comfortable so if you don't like your
first pair you can keep it and they will
still refund you no questions asked
which is pretty major for a claim to be
made from a company you can try it out
no big deal it's which is probably fair
because you probably don't want to send
your underwear back because that would
sort of be weird go to Mac Walden comm

video on the 1 + 5 t we have a hands-on
for that which is pretty neat we have a
video that I hosted whoa what that's
weird
it's the Xbox one X versus ps4 Pro
versus $500 PC results may surprise you
I gotta watch that one too it's
interesting it's everyone's response to
it is exactly what I expected nice yeah
everyone who's on floatplane when I plan
YouTube presents it will be coming to
YouTube later but it's on full plane now
yeah and it's Friday so what are you
gonna do all weekend you have stuff to
do unless you're unless you're a
floatplane heir or coming to my charity
stream now yeah true and our flow plan I
got so much stuff what a double combo
tech quickie on powerline Ethernet which
is actually super interesting powerline
Ethernet is weird it's Internet that
goes through your power lines sort of
makes sense how it works it's pretty
neato the opportunities for education
are immense it's embarrassing tons of
really cool videos razor blade 4k review
I don't think that's on YouTube yet and
that has probably one of the best skits
in a video we've like ever done oh is
that the
the one with me when I'm in this coat no
that was a phone I don't think it's not
alright are you we got lots of good
skits I'm not in it oh yeah can't be the
best get the best get would have us both
yeah yeah yeah so bad pack can get
regards that packing I love how every
once in a while my the words just come
out all right Firefox that topic might
as well move on to it yeah you should
open up the source number two because we
can check it out on the screen and
there's lots to see I need to find it
huh there we go got it the Firefox
hardware survey which uses telemetry
supplied by the browser to assess what
hardware participants are using has
revealed some surprising statistics
related to GPU market share yeah so we
can not see right here because this
isn't the way but I'm just gonna move us
turns out more of people maybe for
graphics we've got AMD at 15% we've got
Intel at 65 percent so that's the
built-in graphics on your CPU look
they're talking about integrated
graphics nvidia 14% that's one percent
behind AMD what the heck would what a
surprise I mean this isn't just people
in the world this is Firefox users yeah
who filled out the survey what all right
did anyone actively fill this out is it
just our first Hardware report I think
you have you have to like opt-in to
supply data or whatever right so it's
possible there's a selection bias where
AMD people are just the type of people
off into this stuff doesn't seem likely
to me I don't think that's necessarily
what's going on I have I have I have I
have a main theory for this Firefox
right now is the like this is the
ethical choice of browsers this is the
underdog browser this is the browser
that not the mainstream uses oh and
those are the same people you can run a
bell and bry this browser or use this
browser I see it's similar arguments to
don't use the big mainstream scary guy
thing that a lot of the AMD guys are
making and I think it might make sense
that there are more of them on this
platform regardless
even if that is true this is still super
cool definitely this is good people for
some reason are comparing this to uses
our stats that we had from steams
hardware survey T pcs is coming in with
the sassy luke where have you been well
there's been the case with Firefox for
years so yeah apparently that might
actually be more true of a statement
than IV so he's backing up your theory
yeah I guess
indirectly he doesn't know yeah no one
actually knows yes that's true yeah I
don't think anyone actually really knows
but I wouldn't be surprised if that is
at least part of it for some reason
people are saying that this is like
super at odds with the steam Hardware
server the latest iteration of which
came out in October yeah where the GPU
mark Scheffer and video was over 80% and
AMD was only 10 and Intel integrated
graphics there's only like seven and a
half it's pretty obvious why these
numbers are so vastly different yeah
selection bias being you're someone who
has steam installed so you're a gamer so
you're less likely that integrated crap
graphics and if you're gonna have a
gaming type of GPU it's likely gonna be
Nvidia surprise surprise most people on
the internet don't have a gaming PC I'm
probably using laptops even that just
don't have any form of dedicated
graphics and it's all integrated on
chips and you can't even add one or
they're using older like best buy pcs
that were just like home pcs that don't
have graphics cards even though it's
like obviously a weird comparison to
make I can see why it's being made
because those steam hardware starts to
get excited a lot particularly in
displays like the fact that only 4% of
steam players have 4k monitors like that
the stack gets thrown around all the
time
when people are talking about how
prevalent 4k monitors really are yeah so
okay it's steam stats are popular but
yeah they just really don't have any
relevance here yeah it doesn't matter
for this specific use case and there's a
lot of Cheaper laptops I don't know if
necessarily right now but at least when
I worked in retail that's sold with AMD
graph
so it was I actually probably sold more
laptops at that point in time that had
AMD graphics because it was more
affordable so more people were buying
them from my store I didn't own the
store but the store that I worked at
give me can we see that page again yeah
it had more than just GPUs on there yeah
that was an interesting part too so it
has quite a few different things
it even has operating system which I
find fascinating Windows 7 was that 46
percent which is Wow
probably pretty crazy witness again is
only that gives credence to your theory
then is a certain like the certain type
of person uses fire people that windows
inside resisted upgrading to Windows 10
that's crazy
I love Windows 7 well I stayed on
Windows 7 for a long time but the only
reason why I moved off of it was because
of be constant super aggressive annoying
pressure from Windows 10 as I moved to a
Windows 8.1 embedded copy so you do that
I'm still on 98 and said nice yeah so
all day that's pretty good
that's pretty cool all day after that
we've got 1% of users on Windows XP guys
update what are you doing oh just
working 8% of people on Windows 8.1
represent I that's me
you think there's a sliver for Vista in
there that's 5% others 6% dozier there's
your Vista speaking of Firefox users
these these people are gonna be pretty
pumped because Firefox quantum is out
now have you used this yeah I have used
it I'm loving it really yeah I was
taking it for a spin it's good
yeah I've so I've seen people having
issues I have not personally had any
issue okay I know there's some things
where people like certain specific
add-ons that aren't quite on quantum yet
some people don't like how certain parts
of the browser aren't customizable but
let's talk about the core value
proposition of this browser
according to Mozilla Firefox quantum is
over twice as fast as the firefox from
just six months ago built on a
completely overhauled core engine and
boasting a stylish new design dubbed
photon UI which streamlines a number of
elements included in previous releases
so i'm not gonna lie this marketing
takes a lot of people off and for
reasons that i understand do they show
it here somewhere they showed like two
times faster and then they show a
comparison of firefox quantum versus the
most recent version of Chrome
so people don't realize that they were
talking about a previous version of
Firefox okay because they show two times
faster in big bold text and then
directly beside it a comparison of
quantum versus Chrome right when they're
meaning two times faster than the
previous version or product
they do say quantum is faster to load a
number of popular websites than Coronis
yeah including Wikipedia Bing no one
cares tumblr and shutterstock no one
cares like Firefox users around 30% less
memory than chrome edge and Safari on
windows so there's there's some things
going on here one thing that I did
appreciate is that in their own testing
in their own video showing load time
comparisons between quantum and Chrome
it shows quantum winning quite often not
by two times and someone with chat says
in fairness in the comparison video it
shows fairly equivalent speeds if I
remember correctly quantum wins usually
and I'm sure they cherry-pick sites to a
certain degree but I know at least one
point in time the Chrome browser did
beat the quantum their own video and
they included in their own video that's
cool I thought that was pretty cool so
he's a weird like we're gonna show
ourselves losing and at the same time
we're gonna do super misleading
marketing so it was like what so like if
anyone actually watched the video at all
they would have known something was up
but yeah it's been a delight to you so
far I think it looks great
it's run great for me float plane runs
on it beautifully just want to put that
out
- tech tips writer Allison Young chimed
in virtually saying Firefox users may
also be more likely to be running ap use
yeah so if we want to jump back slightly
to that topic this was six minutes ago
that he sent me that but we can look at
the processor section which has shown to
you guys good Intel is that 88% AMD's at
12% I don't know the steam hardware
survey for that is but I wouldn't be
surprised if on the steam hardware
server a into was even higher you think
yeah there were so many years where AMD
wasn't putting out a news yeah yeah
right yeah yeah so I don't know but I
wouldn't be surprised but it's it's not
like AMD is crushing the processor side
of things back to the quantum thing I I
was like I should actually just check
this out because I used to use Firefox
like forever until chrome came out in
2008 I just wanted to check it out and I
liked the design haven't use Firefox
since I was like I should go back to my
roots here but then I had the thought
well it'll be like two weeks until
chromis better again they'll make a new
they'll just make a new version it would
be better I like using Firefox and it is
very fast it's it's fast to the point
where when using the previous they said
six months ago it's two times faster and
six months ago it was notably slow and
now it's not notably slower it's fast
enough that I click on a site and it
just loads but here's something that
made me reconsider I saw quote from not
sure if it was a CEO but someone at
Mozilla who is like my biggest fear is
that people just won't try it I just
want people to try it and I read that
now it kind of took my heartstrings bit
I was like you know what man for you
I'll try it
I didn't yet wow I think I want it I'm
gonna check it at all
I don't know if people remember but in a
lot of my older videos I used to where I
have a couple two different shirts one
of them just has the Firefox logo on it
and another one says I'm protecting the
world's largest resource mmm and on the
back it talks about Firefox I kind of
support them a little bit um I even have
a little Firefox plushie thing cuz I
used to be like when I actually
programmed things I used to be a big fan
of
firefox and i stopped using it because
it was directly interfering with my
day-to-day work because firefox was
crashing so often or was slow and all
these other issues and i excitedly but
with a lot of fear installed quantum
because I was like I really don't want
this to fail me again they are making a
lot of strong claims I'm gonna give it a
shot
and I give it a strong shot and I
installed all my different add-ons I
customized it made it look exactly the
way I wanted it to and then dove deeply
and I have it on my work with you to
have my home care now you're fully
entangled it's on my phone it's great
you get it and been awesome anybody get
that joke was a quantum joke oh that is
good that is good
speaking of I really hope that in the
near future these companies stop using Q
or quantum in their branding because
there's gonna come a point where there
are actual products with quantum
capability we need to be able to
differentiate that yes that is actually
I know any means I immediately thought
about that what I saw the name I was
like is it oh yeah we're getting in what
way well I was actually I thought it
might be like some super wacko
experimental thing that they were
working on and then I was like oh it's
just a new browser what that actually
was a little bit confusing so yeah I
hear you on that one but yeah I don't
know I think it's cool having a browser
that actually isn't made by a company
that aggressively profits off of
harvesting every single thing that you
do in your entire life that's weird you
know like I don't know kind of down with
the Firefox a little bit so we've been
doing this for long enough but you want
to do a couple more I mean I'm down we
have been doing this line up what do you
want to do ah there's so many exciting
ones okay there's some rapid-fire ones
okay Apple home pod the big speaker it's
kind of a smart speaker from Apple
delayed missing out on the holiday
season this brings joy to my heart
actually um I'm actually kind of a
anti-fan boy with Apple I do respect
Apple and I think a lot of products are
pretty objectively sick like they're
sweet but on the other hand sometimes I
like a little win I like when because
it's not that I don't like Apple
satisfying stab yeah III don't like
Apple fanboys so I have like a counter
force to that they get out of here
you're talking about the ad not me right
yes yeah it's great so full disclosure
home pod is not it is a small part of of
apples revenue it's in the other
services or in the other section why
don't you eat apples so much I don't
hate apple i hate Apple fanboys apples
pretty dope do you hate Android fanboys
I hate all fanboys okay I like objective
people okay but so you want app Apple to
hurt because you dislike the people that
like Apple no I don't want Apple to hurt
I want Apple fanboys to hurt ah so
you're hoping this doesn't really hurt
their bottom line
anymore but you're also like haha you
don't get your thing for Christmas yeah
it won't hurt the bottom line because
this is one of their other products and
they get like the majority of the
revenue from the iPhones and their
services so that's gonna be miniscule
anyway but it actually could hurt them
in the future because right now these
smart home smart speakers and and home
the implementations are really starting
to gain traction especially since little
mini is out now there's a bazillion
different types of Amazon echoes I think
they're gonna be a pretty significant
gift this holiday season and I got one
from Apple to miss that it's gonna be
yeah that hurts and it's it's hitting
mainstream and my grandfather and my mom
have one that's not like that's not like
me forcing it on them be like use this
to support your sodden dark grandpa yeah
this is like I got one for my grandpa I
believe he got one for my mom and they
both like actively use it all the time
well everyone has everyone has
everything these days like what are you
gonna get someone for Christmas in so
this is totally a thing yeah except the
home pod won't be notably Google's
answer to the home pod which is the
Google
home max looks very similar has similar
sound like speaker focusing capabilities
it will be on sale this holiday season
and this is just so bad for Apple
because even though Siri is the oldest
virtual assistant its assistant it is
quite clearly the worst and they just
need any ability it's less than Cortana
hmm or are you only classifying the two
I was known as that no I was thinking of
a Bob Bixby as well uh Bixby is actually
pretty dope really it's probably as a
general assistant it's probably on the
level of Siri but it has these extra
capabilities that we used in our
showcase video that you let you navigate
through apps like open this app and go
to settings and then change this setting
go to my home screen swipe right you
can't even do that with the assistant
yet and I can't wait until you can cuz
it's super sweet to be able to do that
Cortana I don't know I've actually seen
videos on YouTube of people using
Cortana to do these like kick-ass things
in Excel which I would I'd love to to
program macros by voice like using
Cortana just like how can't be bothered
because it seems like such a upfront
cost but anyway Apple needs any
opportunity they can get to try to catch
up in this space and they're just not
getting it and eventually I think it's
gonna be the end I don't think I've ever
heard anyone say anything positive about
Cortana although that Excel thing does
sound cool but I haven't had it work in
any form in any other way so there's
that or Bigsby I haven't personally used
Bigsby but that dedicated button is
rough well I mean I didn't say it's
perfect I'm just saying like serious is
pretty weak yes yeah watching the
lioness try to use Siri to call someone
while we were driving for lunch was
hilarious oh no it just it just couldn't
it just couldn't do it like it was
actually hilariously bad
well the Google assistants not perfect
either I'm actually no I'm disappointing
you know what makes me can do that
assistant doesn't seem to be able to is
chain commands like on Bixby I can say
Siri can't do that because Google
assistant can
Google's my goo my Google home even
though I can say the command and say
turn on my TV and I can tell it to play
a certain video on YouTube I can't say
turn on the TV and play the latest
Vsauce video on YouTube it'll say I
don't know how to do that but if I say
there was one I did yesterday words you
can't do that either
well but BICS we can change commands it
can do things like go to Instagram and
post my third latest photo with the
caption blah blah okay how's that one
long command yeah yeah you can say go to
the settings and open and go to display
settings and change the screen timeout
to ten minutes yeah okay which is cool
but there was a command I issued to my
Google assistant that I it was two
commands and I put them this way and it
said I don't know how to do that and
then I rephrased it the same commands in
a different order and then it did it
like I wonder if that's part of it cuz I
use Google assistant for everything and
I play specific songs with it within
like it has to open an app and then find
the specific song and whatnot all the
time which is two different steps
hmm well music and play whatever that's
actually one because you can't say open
google play music yeah I know that I
can't say hey open YouTube on Google
home I can't say open YouTube on the TV
I have to say open you two can play
Linus tech tips on the TV yeah but then
I don't person it this is what we should
probably move on but I don't personally
think that's a huge point because Bigsby
isn't in a home device is it yeah I
don't know anyways Amazon echo is coming
to Canada
Lance would be so stoked we can finally
start reviewing him and stuff yes do you
know that story no we got neck oh oh
he tried that's right dude I tried on
the fire TV I brought it home on a
weekend and stuff and I was like the
interface like this is work
yeah I was on tech support calls and all
this Junkin is like yeah just not
supposed to be using that yeah it's like
you and you can like with mine it was
like you can't use it at all it wouldn't
even allow itself to set up so I like
VPN to my router so that when it
connected to the Wi-Fi I thought it was
in America and I was like okay cool
okay and then yeah yeah hi - hi there
are gonna be all salty that you're not
here now well they're going well now
they know that I'm on the LAN show even
though you're in the building what does
it mean
why is this quitting video someone in
the chat said Linus is fired he's just
gonna drive his multiple Tesla roadsters
from now on that he drives around in his
Tesla semi-truck what are we talking
about we're talking about a Mazon right
yeah so so we got one for review I had a
vpmi router - even freaking make the
thing work at all and then it couldn't
do almost anything because I'm in Canada
and it doesn't know any of the stuff for
up here and I was just like oh okay and
then we sent it to a person I'm not
gonna say who who was in America to do a
review on it and like write the the the
notes for the review for us and then we
never heard from them again no it's gone
well it's here now and apparently it's
gonna speak Canadian English with a
Canadian English accent so Eastern then
I know I don't I it's gonna say a boot
like I don't know what's the difference
what's it gonna say yeah open that a
it's gonna say sorry instead of sorry
sorry alright so I say like I don't know
I guess what this one summer in the chat
said Zed that makes sense yeah yeah yeah
it's mostly it's mostly that we's
pronounced o's like o's and they
pronounced always like a is a lot like
I'm sorry and what's another one I've
been oh sorry yeah yeah but anyway it
won't speak French yet I don't care
neither do I is I don't speak French
people who me apparently 20% of our
population does yeah yeah well like as
their main language it'll be coming from
more than come I bet you more than 25%
of our population can speak French I bet
you twenty four twenty percent of our
population speaks French as their main
language no if it's less than that
actually
really didn't put in the in the notes
what I read it earlier but this isn't
actually the first country I thought we
would be maybe the second country that
echo was in but we're not they went to
India a month ago and Japan last week
and presumably it's not English in India
and Japan yeah so get on it French come
oh there's give you some deals to the
echo is gonna be $99.99 Canadian peso is
instead of a regular 130 the echo dot is
gonna be fifty bucks instead of 70 and
the echo plus is gonna be 170 instead of
two hundo
Gary a B that's what it's gonna say you
yeah issued a command it's gonna execute
the map command and say dare you be dare
by if you like if you if you tell it
like I'm gonna go hike Mount Everest
it'll be like good luck big shoots I've
never even heard that one anyways show's
over yeah that's it bye if you want to
see a cool charity stream tune in
tomorrow I'll probably start it noon are
you gonna be lazy looking no try it try
it but I'm not gonna do it I like it man
it's crazy how much everything
everything's super blue that's cool hey
yeah that would eat every day we should
actually submit this Rancho to an editor
so when you put these on at the very end
it like does a crazy effect just super
enough for the people that made it to
the end now all these people sing lazy
Luke anyways come by check out the
charity stream if you want it's gonna be
awesome I don't know what the heck Jake
is trying to say but it's fine
you called me a ho these are relevant Oh
hardly it's okay oh that's the most
harsh thing influencer could say to you
well I was dropping a reference back to
the idubbbz rice come kind of deal no no
that is it I'm going home Wow where is
bye thanks for watching bye bye
a charity stream twitch on TV /
Lucarelli afar show up donate money to
kids or just watch actually do it it's
gonna be lots of cool games retro stuff
yeah boom it works
where'd you write on that napkin that
you crumpled up
lazy Lou
looks at you and make to beYOU
apparently I'm also supposed to say
discord dot G g /l TT yeah nothing ended
yet we were just doing the thank you - I
fix it and thank you too Mac Weldon and
thank you - ZOTAC so yeah I guess check
out that discord we actually have an
official discord now so check it out if
you link your forum account you get
access right away if you don't I think
