be unboxing the EVGA GeForce 8600 GT s
super super clocked edition 256
megabytes PCIe DirectX 10 ready with a
big circle DirectX 10 ready HDCP capable
back when anyone cared about that video
card it is sli ready it is graphics by
Nvidia and it has a free copy of enemy
territory quake Wars inside it also
includes EVGA 90-day step-up program
which probably isn't valid for this card
anymore I'm thinking because it's pretty
old ok SLI ready full DirectX 10 support
blah blah blah this is all the same
stuff you saw before high dynamic range
lighting Wow
- dual link DVI outputs support - 2560
by 1600 resolution displays Wow
what else do we got here ok lifetime
warranty really comes with a lifetime
warranty upon product registration lots
pretty cool pretty cool for like a
relatively low end card alright make
sure these two stickers match up before
you buy this card let's open this baby
up there we are
break that seal like nobody's business
design for extreme HD gaming not anymore
it isn't
but it was I hated this packaging from
EVGA bethany's to package cards like
this because it was impossible because
of the the lips on the plastic to put it
back in without catching the tab here so
then he could never put the stupid card
back in the box if you wanted to which
is a problem when you're a professional
unboxer like me okay the folder contains
EVGA k stickers and installation CD with
trial software and an installation guide
so for that CD away download the latest
drivers off the Nvidia website because I
can pretty much guarantee you this is a
really old driver at this point alright
so let's go ahead and throw this back in
there EVD is packaging has really come a
long way since then ok enemy territory
quake Wars ok not super relevant game
anymore look at this we got one of those
components out thing
bombs that could be useful not all right
we've got to molex to single PCIe power
adapter we've got an s-video out cable
that could be useful not okay then we've
got two DVI to VGA adapters because back
then most people still running VGA
monitors well not maybe not most but
many gamers we're still running VGA
monitors even if they were buying gaming
graphics cards all right so here I'm
just going to put the other side this
aside put this on the side and bring it
over here we'll have a look at the 8600
GT s now I don't remember exactly what
the difference was between the 8600 GT s
and the 8600 GT but um my understanding
is it's something to do with lower
memory on the GTS and the higher clock
speed or something like that and the
performance was fairly similar now
there's a very good reason actually that
I'm doing this particular retro unboxing
but I'm going to get to that after I
have a look at the overall layout of the
card so this is from back when gaming
cards could actually be single slot so
you can see here we've got just a single
fan here we've got a nice little cooler
I don't know if it includes any heat
pipes it looks like it doesn't just a
typical thin cooler and it actually
exhausts all of the air either out the
back of the cooler here or probably more
of it comes out of the top of it here so
that's going to be maybe a bit of an
issue for the card the next one down
because as I recall the 8600 did round a
little on the toasty side but shouldn't
be that big of a deal especially with
the ventilation that you get in most
decent gaming cases the sli bridge used
to be located in a fairly different
location compared to what we see now
where the sli bridge is usually right
about here and as they have maybe a
secondary one here on many parts we've
got a single PCIe 6 pin power connector
we've got some capacitors and voltage
regulation we've got a PCI Express 16 X
slot that the card runs off of and then
up here where we would typically these
days see DVI DVI and mini HDMI we now
see that s-video and component output
ething as to go along with the two dual
link
DVI ports on the back of the card we
find nothing really of interest and
that's pretty much it so why did I do
this unboxing the reason is that I
wanted to compare a card from a few
years ago to a card that costs the same
today as this one did a few years ago
and I want to do what I did with the GTX
560 t I launched with the 550 ti
launched so I'm going to take that card
from a few years ago in the similar
price bracket and I'm going to say okay
let's say you own one of these or you
own an 8600 GT or some other similar
class of GPU what kind of an image
quality improvement what kind of a
gameplay improvement are you going to
see by upgrading to a current generation
similar DirectX 11 GPU such as the 550
ti so thank you for checking out this
unboxing of the 8600 GT s super super
clocked don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other videos especially if
you do want to see that image quality
comparison I'll likely use Crysis just
because it's a you know a pretty
demanding game I might use Metro 2033
haven't really decided yet but
definitely subscribe if you want to make
sure that you catch that image quality
comparison between the 550 ti or ty and
the old 88 88 8600 TTS super super claw</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
