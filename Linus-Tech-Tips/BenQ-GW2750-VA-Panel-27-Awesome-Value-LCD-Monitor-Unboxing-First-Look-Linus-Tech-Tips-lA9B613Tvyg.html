the Ben qgw 2750 this is a pretty unique
product and that it is a 27-inch monitor
it has a and it has a VA panel it uses
an LED backlight which means a lot of
things so you should have excellent
viewing angle and color reproduction
great power efficiency and a really
really low price point I know I never
really talk about price in these videos
but this monitor is around three bills
or a 27 inch VA LED backlit monitor now
monitor unboxings are kind of tough to
film live because there's a whole lot of
unpackaging and assembling that needs to
be done but what I'm going to do is I'm
going to unbox all the components and
stuff that we're finding here and then
I'm going to assemble it off camera and
then I'll show you all will fire it up
rather click here and I'll just kind of
show you guys and give you my
impressions of how the image actually
looks because you know it's one thing to
say okay it's gotta be a panel or it's
got an IPS panel or whatever other kind
of good panel technology that's oh
really anything but TN at this point but
it's a whole other one it actually fire
it up and have a lesson see how
impressive it is so there's the base
glossy base I mean I wish we'd I wish
we'd get away from glossy but it is what
it is
here's the arm so because this is more
of a value priced high-end panel monitor
you're not going to see things like
height adjustable stand or anything like
that pretty so it's a pretty basic
pretty basic stand but personally I
believe that the image quality of the
monitor is priority number one and then
if you can afford the luxuries of things
like you know pivot and height
adjustable stand and all of that may be
good for you like that's great but good
panel first don't get a fancy TN monitor
because it doesn't make sense you're the
part that you're going to be staring at
is the part between the bezels not the
part on the outside of the business and
depending on you know sort of how your
how your personal tastes go I'd rather
have a really nice image sitting on top
of like you know a video card box to get
it up a little bit higher than a crappy
image that's not exactly the right level
to look at it I mean if you look at my
desk though it's fairly evident that
pretty ghetto something si that's that's
all to be expected so here we go here's
the monitor itself oh you got ok 178
degree viewing angle to VA panel I
believe it five thousand to one native
contrast ratio now you see contrast
ratios up there that are like 1 million
to one that's a dynamic contrast ratio
it is it is a bit of a trick five
thousand to one is a very good contrast
ratio and especially if it's a true
contrast ratio sixteen by nine okay this
is pretty much to be expected and check
this out this is another thing that you
don't find at this price point matte
screen matte ballin so finishing on
packaging the product so we've got our
power cable our audio cable our CD for
whatever reason
just has a manual on it brought to my
attention that the one display cable
included with this monitor is a VGA
cable sadface I've seen this from BenQ
before if you're going to include one
cable I'd really appreciate it if it was
a DVI cable as opposed to a VGA cable I
understand why they did it because the
VGA cable means that no matter what
especially for like big-box retail
customers who might maybe not aren't as
educated or don't have as high-end a
machine as like an NCIX customer would
have it'll prevent returns because they
will have the cable that they need to
run the display even if it's not
optimally but it just makes me sad to
see a beautiful panel beautiful monitor
like this and think that someone
somewhere is running it off of VGA okay
moving right along side buttons are here
Auto menu up-down entering power so
nothing out of the ordinary their inputs
on the bottom again nothing out of the
ordinary so you got your power in you've
got your audio pass-through you've got
your HDMI DVI and sadface connector the
assembly is very very quick for this
monitor so you just slide this piece
into here screw this in and then usual
finger type screw thing on the bottom
that sets the base up to that you've got
your ventilation holes in the top there
that are keeping and you it's not as
much of a concern with LEDs as it was
with cold cathodes because cold cathodes
kick off a lot more heat for the amount
of light that they produce compared to
LEDs so internal power supply and just a
little bit of ventilation is no problem
you can also see just in the thickness
even though it's a 27-inch panel it's
still quite thin if I can find my iPhone
and we do the iPhone comparison so you
can see exactly the thickness of the
character two sec now look and I are
actually both pretty impressed with the
monitor overall 1080p monitor so you
don't have that additional resolution
that yeah personally I'd like to see
once we get above about 24 inches 27 to
30 inch I'd like to see 2560 by 1440 or
by 1600 but it's not the end of the
world and what you do get with the VA
panel is the viewing angle that you need
because these large format monitors okay
is this one perfect the answer is no but
it's a $300 monitor so you have to keep
your expectations in line with what
you're paying for it's very very good
compared to anything with a TN panel
what it will ever be in terms of the
color def which is very noticeable on
cheap monitors we're even watching a
video like this you'll be able to see
that there's no color depth in things
like the jeans everything turns to
blockiness
on things like a black box where it
doesn't have it can't pick up enough
detail to show you the the differences
in color between the slightly less black
and the slightly more black so it's got
that going for it however you know if
you get a little bit up high on it then
you can you can see a bit of a shift in
the in the brightness more than anything
else from the low up is not nearly as
bad and side-to-side is excellent so
there are very few scenarios where you'd
ever run into this now the most
important thing because this is a
monitor it's not like you're going to
have six people watching it like a TV
you know from all kinds of different
angles monitor you're going to sit here
and you're going to look at it like this
with a large format monitor never buy a
TN because TNS will distort the color
and the brightness and as has little of
an angle as this right here which is a
big problem because it means that by the
time you look at the edge of your screen
you're seeing color loss or distortion
at the engine screen up and down the
large panel monitors must be VA IPS or
PL s that is the only way to go so if
you're looking for a value monitor in a
27 inch 1080p don't get a T and get
something like this for maybe it doesn't
have the height of
whilst and all it's pretty much God is
tilt the pivot nothing like that but
it's a good panel so I mean you've
always got the option of getting a
better mounting arm for it or something
because it's got these events on the
back in the future if you do want to go
that route something to bear in mind
about the whole resolution thing is as
much as I might harp on 1080p monitors
that are larger format sizes that's not
necessarily going to be the case for
everybody because just because I like a
30-inch high-density monitor doesn't
mean that my you know my in-laws want
one actually they recently complained
about their 23 inch 1080p monitors
saying they wanted something bigger but
more magnified in which case something
like this would be perfect for them when
your eyes aren't as good anymore it's
helpful to actually just have everything
be a little bit bigger so the same
resolution but a larger monitor and
27-inch you'll start to see the gaps
between the pixels a little bit but
let's face it if you need the
magnification you probably aren't seeing
that anyway so thanks for checking out
this unboxing the first look at this did
actually incredibly good value monitors
