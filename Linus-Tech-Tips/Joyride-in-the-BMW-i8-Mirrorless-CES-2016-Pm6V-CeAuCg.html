it's going to be a little bit different
last time we got to see the inside of a
tent and we got to see a car from the
outside this time we're seeing the
outside of a tent and we are going to be
playing around in the i8 mirrorless from
the inside actually taking her for a
drive so this would be my first time
ever driving well anything this high
performance so I am actually pretty
stoked right now let's get going
so the test-drive started out with a few
surprises number one is that the i8 was
really really comfortable for me
sometimes it's nice to be small Wow this
is a car that I actually feel like right
at home and at my size look at that
number two is I was actually surprised
as many of our viewers know I'm really
not that much of a car guy so I was
surprised when we started the car and I
realized that it has a three cylinder
supplementary gasoline motor which
contributed along with some simulated
sounds to the car not being as quiet as
I had initially expected though
switching to pure electric mode later
was a very different and very silent
experience and number three the
mirrorless rearview display I guess is
what I'm going to call it was a lot
better than I expected and the cameras
hooked up to it really really impressed
as you can see the entirety of behind
you that is way better which doesn't
mean that I got the hang of it right off
the bat in fact the first thing I did
when I went to back out of the parking
stall was to wrench my back around put
my hand on the back of the passenger
seat and try to stare out the back of
the vehicle though no no that's not what
to do you are actually just supposed to
stare at the mirror and monitor the live
video feed from the cameras that are
directly out the back of the car and the
ones that are positioned where normally
the rear view mirrors would be on the
left and right side of the vehicle so
from there it was pretty much off to the
races I mean it's not to say that it
went completely smoothly especially at
the beginning of the test-drive I was
constantly trying to check my mirrors on
the left and right side of the car but
what's interesting about even that is
that my behavior started to shift very
very quickly something that I don't
think would have happened if this system
wasn't so cool so let's talk a little
bit about the cameras they're positioned
on the right and left side mirrors
facing backwards or where the mirrors
would be see I can't even help but call
those positions the mirror
and then there are two additional ones
that are on the body of the car pointed
towards the back those are the depth
ones so let's talk a little bit more
about those cameras there are four 1.3
megapixel cameras and let me tell you
this is not the 1.3 megapixel camera
that's in that cheap Chromebook that you
were looking at as kind of a disposable
computer not all pixels are created
equally and I have to say these ones
looked really really good now I did only
get to try the car in broad daylight but
BMW is saying that with the extra time
that they have between building a
concept car and actually bringing this
product to market they have a lot more
work to do and they're confident that
they will be delivering nighttime vision
capabilities out of these cameras
without relying on infrared light that
exceed the capabilities of an unassisted
human and the other thing that I thought
was really cool about them is the way
that the whole thing is stitched
together so when you're just driving
down the road and the most important
thing is hey what's behind my car all of
a sudden with one glance you've got not
just what's outside the rear window but
what is outside the rear almost 180
degrees of the vehicle it's great for
being able to get a quick and efficient
glance at what is important to me as the
driver and this is neat to the
information actually changes depending
on the context of what I'm doing as a
driver so for example hitting the turn
signal to turn is going to go ahead and
widen up the stitching on that side so
that I can get a better idea if there's
say for example a pedestrian to the side
of my car that might have snuck up on me
or a cyclist coming up beside me in a
bike lane but that's not all they can do
so the four rear view cameras can
actually work with the other four
cameras and sensors that enable BMWs
like bird's-eye out-of-body experience
thing that we saw the other day with the
i3 where that car was able to park
itself look at lines on the road to find
well the parking spots to park itself
and this is cool if someone bumps it
send you an alert that gives you this
live view of
what the car looks like from the outside
so you can check for vandals and then
they take that mode and they put it to
even better use so this is an issue that
I have with sporty-er cars and really
cars in general it's often very very
difficult to shoulder check and see into
the blind spot that is created by a
traditional mirror setup this takes it
one step further not only can you see
completely behind you to the left when
you're trying to change lanes on the
highway for example you can see the
entire rear of the car at a glance in a
way that is genuinely useful and what do
I mean by genuinely useful ah yes
very good question if this system had an
unacceptable degree of latency I would
be crapping all over it because that is
totally unacceptable at the speeds that
you might be moving never mind on the
Autobahn but even on a regular highway
here in North America and I have to say
BMW has done a pretty bang-up job of not
only just having a low latency camera
and display but also doing all of the
processing that they're doing pretty
much in real time
check out this demo ok so this would be
an interesting test of the latency of
the system you guys will be able to see
my mouth moving we're not going to mess
with this at all and I'm wearing a
lavalier microphone on me that will give
you guys an exact idea of how much delay
there is between something happening and
what's on the screen so I guess all
that's left to say at this point is what
a freakin cool practical application of
Technology on this concept car and I
wish I could say this concept can point
behind me but that's just the regular i8
it's the one with actual mirrors which
for now is fine because at the moment at
least in the u.s. driving around in a
car with no mirrors is not actually
street-legal but that doesn't change the
fact that I got to drive one it doesn't
change the fact that it's really cool
and way way better than I expect it to
be and it doesn't change the fact that
that technology is most assuredly coming
so a huge thanks
to BMW for hosting us here for allowing
me to take their i8 mirrorless concept
out for a drive and a huge thanks to you
guys for checking out this and all our
other content here at CES 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
