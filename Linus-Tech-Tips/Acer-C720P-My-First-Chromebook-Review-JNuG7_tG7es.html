DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts now I've never
reviewed a Chromebook for a couple of
reasons number one is that no one ever
offered me a sample and number two was
that I didn't care about them enough to
even bother to ask for one
well Acer managed to address point
number one for me by offering to send
over their C 720p touchscreen Chromebook
and while I still didn't really care the
spec on this $300 device surprised me
it's got a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core
Haswell based processor and 4 gigs of
ddr3 RAM on top of that I guess I kind
of owed them one for being super late on
returning some other samples so I was
like sure what the hey I'll check it out
now this won't be a review per se since
I don't have any other Chromebooks to
compare with so it'll be more of a
disjointed summary of my thoughts as I
fumbled my way through Chrome OS for the
first time with some specific comments
about this exact model but mostly focus
on the general stuff so first up the
build quality of this unit is better
than I expected it's quite solid but
very plasticky and not nearly as sexy
and slim as Acer's premium offerings
booting up is lightning-fast the 16 gigs
of solid-state storage takes care of
that and the setup process only takes a
couple of minutes if you already have a
Google account I'd say it's even faster
than Android it logs you into your junk
imports your profile picture and all
that which is great and yes I know
Windows has similar functionality if you
use SkyDrive and hotmail I mean outlook
but who does so that's great
speaking of Windows though some stuff
feels a touch borrowed there's a Status
tray down here instead of the system
tray there's a handy chrome apps
launcher in place of the traditional
Start menu I wish the launcher could be
moved back and forth on the taskbar like
it can on Windows but it's stuck in the
traditional Start Menu spot but other
than that it's pretty familiar to use
the launcher contains all of your apps
but not your extensions
the distinction between which is a
little confusing to the user because the
list of extensions in the browser
contains both and the search within the
launcher at the top actually finds
everything - but a really cool thing
about the search is that it finds stuff
that you've installed both apps and
extensions and it also finds available
stuff and suggests things based on
what's available in the store but that
you don't have yet alright so navigation
time let's start with the mouse double
click and drag like tap tap tap hold
drag is not available and the touchpad
is generally not super configurable some
gestures are supported like swiping back
and swiping forth in a browser but
really not much I mean that didn't
bother me that much but the absence of a
hardware right-click is a big problem
for me I use it for everything from you
know right-click copy right click paste
to correcting spelling errors within
emails and a two-finger
soft touch is just not as fast as being
able to use two hands to operate the
touchpad at the same time so left hand
for tracking right hand for right and
left click and that's pretty ridiculous
to me for the keyboard this arrow key
layout is a pet peeve of mine but the
keyboard is otherwise actually a very
strong point of this notebook
it ain't satisfying to type on and it
sounds really thin and kind of crappy
but I'm really fast and accurate on it
even though I can't quite put my finger
on why get it put my finger on it cuz
the keyboard to put all my finger anyway
I'm sorry anyway the F keys are gone and
that weirded me out a little bit but if
they don't have any functionality in
Chrome OS beyond being media Keys and
shortcuts then good riddance to the
function modern modifier I suppose
immersive mode and overview mode are
both quite cool and allow you to
basically go fullscreen or expose style
have everything sort of pop up on the
screen and allow you to select it
something that I ended up using the
touchscreen for a fair bit and there's a
couple other interesting things that are
gone so caps lock the scourge of the
Internet is gone replaced by a dedicated
search key but don't worry you can
rebind search and not only that but ctrl
+ alt
other stuff if you want so you can bring
back caps lock if it's really important
to you and finally there is no Delete
key but you can use alt backspace if you
want I would have personally preferred a
hardware delete key instead of power up
here and then like an on keyboard based
power button but I guess there's always
trade-offs and no one's going to be
happy with everything so we'll close the
usability with the killer app of this
Chromebook the 1366 by 768 touchscreen
yes it's a TN panel so there's nothing
really special about it in terms of
colors or viewing angles and touch
screens with plastic fronts always feel
a little bit janky to me but at this
price the plastic front is more solid
than some of the ones I've felt and it's
a miracle that we're getting a
touchscreen at all let alone a glass
covered one the main stuff like accuracy
is fine and I honestly did find myself
using it I have a touchscreen Windows
eight notebook and I'd say the
experience is probably pretty similar
unlike Android and iOS it's not like you
can do everything with the touch screen
but for stuff like you know casually
scrolling through a list or you know
zooming in and out or selecting which
app you want with the multitasking
button it offers finer control than
touchpad gestures and it's faster than
just using the touchpad to point at
things so two thumbs up for having that
functionality two thumbs up
so now let's move into some of the
general observations I made about Chrome
OS minimize maximize and then dock left
and dock right control could be better
you can snap to the sides like in
Windows Vista onward but pulling
something up to the top doesn't
automatically maximize the window and
when a window is maximized you have to
actually click the little button in the
top right corner in order to unmask some
eyes it you can't just grab it and then
drag it around and have it resize itself
the folder structure is simplistic to
the point of being absolutely
infuriating the only file storage on the
thing is called downloads I mean
seriously I get you want me to use the
included hundred gigs of Google Drive
storage that I have for two years and
get hooked so I can start paying
but if unlike iOS
gonna actually have storage that's local
and you're gonna let me make my own
folder structure and stuff within it you
might as well at least let me change the
name everything is a download apps in
the store don't filter according to what
is compatible so that was a little bit
frustrating I mean a great example would
be the IE tab app that gives you better
compatibility with some websites on
Windows so you can have an IE tab within
chrome is only available on Windows
where IE is separately installed but it
still shows up in the store even when
you're searching for it on here I mean
most people will know for that one but
this is just a general problem I'm
speaking of compatibility playing back
video files is pretty hit or miss not
much can be done to update codec support
other than just wait for Google I mean
what you could do I guess if I was going
to give you a solution Google might like
it's just upload the files to YouTube
then watch them on the Chromebook from
there but that that's not a great
solution sometimes it's nice to play
things locally like if you're on a plane
multiple instances of the same
application pop up in a list down at the
bottom when you hover over them just
like in Windows 7 I don't think the
implementation is that great though for
example the integrated video player
nests with your file explorer equivalent
so that's not that intuitive to me I'm
Google Hangouts on the other hand this
is the best implementation I've seen of
Google Hangouts the conversations spread
out from the right across the taskbar
and it's like it's all like it doesn't
feel like it's just like bolted to your
browser you don't have to use a
third-party app video calls are super
seamless and I love hangouts on this
device I need an app like that work that
works exactly this way on Windows video
calls speaking of hangouts are also
seamless and I guess this is a good time
to comment on the video chat experience
I was just randomly listening to some
music on the unit getting getting a feel
for it and I was blown away by how loud
and clear it gets for what is a very
inexpensive notebook then I figured it
out this is a communication device Acer
went balls-to-the-wall
on the microphone and speakers because
video hangouts is going to be a huge
selling point for a device like this the
webcam is actually decent as well so
here's a sample clip of me just sitting
in front of it
so my intention is to use this video
clip to give you guys some idea of what
a voice chat from this Chromebook would
look like and sound like so overall the
experience of the Chromebook was
surprisingly good I wasn't expecting it
to be this good but it would really take
some workflow changes to make a
Chromebook seamless for me and the
biggest issue would be when I'm without
internet and Google knows this I mean
they want you online in the tutorial the
work offline tutorial bit is at the very
end and includes the words I got a kick
out of this for the rare times when you
are disconnected from the internet
here are some offline ready apps for the
rare times right okay I guess I never
leave the house the list includes
offline Gmail Google Docs and calendar
as well as some cool third-party ones
and that's fine but there's plenty of
basic stuff that just doesn't work
offline I disconnected temporarily on
purpose to diagnose something and the
help menu just started behaving
strangely like clicking on things just
didn't really do anything it didn't say
hey you're offline we can't bring
anything up it just didn't do anything
and it took me a while to figure out
that I was offline and it's a live
document I mean there's something to be
said for live documents that are
constantly updated but there's also
something to be said for locally stored
ones that update periodically because
then you can get at them if you're
having a problem and you actually need
to help I mean either solution is
perfect but the biggest challenge for me
wasn't what's the experience but rather
where does this device fit into my
digital life it's not a replacement for
your desktop or your notebook so what is
it I don't know like is it a tablet with
a low price and a keyboard or is it a
netbook with solid battery life a usable
screen size and an OS that doesn't drag
it down like a boat anchor maybe it's
both and as crazy as this might sound
while I won't junk my tablet if I'm a
very on the move person I would probably
go see 720p over something like a
Microsoft Surface
if productivity is a priority for me
they're both kind of immature platforms
but at least if I'm going to bet on this
one it's only a three hundred dollar
investment in a device that might not be
cutting edge but does what it says
is going to do and in a competent matter
and Google has Chrome's ever-growing
market share to continue to drive
innovation in the Chrome App and
extension developer community Windows RT
in Windows eight touchiered we'll see I
forgot to do an outro guys like this
