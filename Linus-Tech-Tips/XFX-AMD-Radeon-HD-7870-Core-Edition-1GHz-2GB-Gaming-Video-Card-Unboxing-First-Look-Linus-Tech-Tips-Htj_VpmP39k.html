the Radeon HD 7870 from XFX this is
their core Edition card but even though
it's a core or like a more basic Edition
card I guess compared to their double D
card which has two cooling fans this is
still a gigahertz Edition card so the
GPU itself is clocked at one gigahertz
so this is not based on the same GPU as
the 7950 in the 7970 which are using a
larger die a more complicated chip to
produce this is using the Pitcairn core
which is the same one as is in the 7870
as well as the 7850 my performance wise
the 7870 falls just in the range of a
GTX 570 or 580 usually falling in
between those two cards from the
competition but because this is
manufactured on a more advanced process
it is able to achieve that performance
with less power consumption as well as a
lower price so let's see what XFX
includes with their particular card here
a crossfire bridge that's a standard
length one however if your motherboard
requires a longer one they usually come
with them they do not disturb I'm gaming
door hanger I have their old one from
back when XFX was Nvidia exclusive over
there on my door I've also got a driver
DVD download the latest off the AMD
website
limited warranty terms for full details
please refer to support central so they
actually don't include that in the
documentation they just want you to go
online and check it out that's sort of
smart quick install guide install guide
for the drivers pro series power supply
brochure for their power supplies as
well some other great XFX products
another brochure okay so that's pretty
much all the information we need let's
have a look at the XFX Radeon 7870
itself now these have been in in a bit
of a production shortfall for the most
part since they were released but what
that should tell you about them is that
they deliver a very compelling price to
performance ratio and also
you just take the software and also that
people are demanding these cards so
let's have a closer look at this
particular card XFX does such a good job
of the aesthetics and the overall look
of their GPUs but let's dig a little bit
deeper and find out how well design this
is check this out so this is a very
beefy cooler considering that even
though this is a an enthusiast class of
card this is still not the highest end
GPU which you find on the 7950 in the
7970 so they've put an aluminum yunus
ink across almost the entire card itself
which is making contact with key
components that do need to be cooled
while staying well elevated over other
components that don't need to be cooled
so you can see there's gaps in it here
here down in there I hope you can see
that where you can see right through to
the PCB which is giving you airflow over
the components that don't need to be
directly contacted by the Unison and in
providing extra cooling to those that do
so that's a very neat design choice I
actually haven't seen that before it
then uses an aluminum shroud which has
like a brushed look as well as some sort
of chrome looking accents with their
ghost thermal technology slogan on here
as well as the XFX logo here we've got a
standard ish I guess it's getting
standard these days although it's still
not on many reference cards but an 80
millimeter fan in the middle we've also
got four heat pipes that are carrying
heat away from the GPU itself can you
see those okay away from the GPU itself
you'll be able to see them better from
the top and then out to two aluminum
FINRA's on either side of the fan itself
so that is how the GPU is getting cooled
they yeah like I said they're so good at
this check this out so we've got another
metal brushed piece which is Radeon red
is it AMD red I mean AMD's colours never
been read but they're still using the
ATI red on the graphics cards which
looks absolutely fantastic power for
this card is provided by two PCIe 6 pin
power adapters and it supports up to two
way crossfire so AMD has removed the
option for multi way crossfire
configurations from this card it makes
sense because honestly if you're buying
three so to step-down GPUs you should
probably just be buying one or two
higher end ones instead because it's
going to yield better performance do
- the way that crossfire and actually
SLI technology both inherently scale now
in terms of output options this is a two
gigabyte graphics card which means that
it is more than capable of driving
slightly older games and by older I
don't mean like three four years old I
mean like sort of last year six months
ago like current generation as well as
older games at extremely high resolution
so having that extra graphics memory
makes all the difference in the world
because you have to load all the
textures into the memory so even if you
have a high performance card that's
maybe from the competition say like a
gtx 570 with only one point two gigs of
memory the 7870 will absolutely rock it
as soon as you start to increase the
resolution beyond a single monitor so
what that means is that this monitor or
this card not only supports up to four
displays out concurrently using 2d vis a
DVI and HDMI or DVI and HDMI and then
the two display ports but it can
actually drive games as long as you're
not GPU bound it has enough memory to
hold all the textures necessary that you
don't end up crippling the performance
this is a pcie 3.0 16 X card so that
rounds out it's sort of current to
future generation technology so that
means with your new Hydra bridge system
or your sandy bridge-e system you will
be able to take advantage of all of that
bandwidth although it's quite debatable
whether or not that's going to make any
performance difference whatsoever so
basically good pricing good performance
and really the reason I'm doing this
unboxing is because I really needed one
so that I could test it against the
upcoming GTX all wait I should probably
shouldn't say so that I can release this
