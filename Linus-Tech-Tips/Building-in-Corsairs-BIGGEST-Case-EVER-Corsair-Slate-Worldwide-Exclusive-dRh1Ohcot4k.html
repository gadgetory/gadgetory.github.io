at the Corsair concepts late a
theoretical spiritual successor to the
big bold and beautiful 900 D fast
forward to today and we somehow got one
of the only two prototypes in existence
here in the lab what are we gonna do
with it well how about a bowls to the
wall 18 core workstation whoa the
producers are telling me that it will
also have a second rig in it for gaming
this is madness but you know what isn't
madness tunnel bear tunnel bear makes it
easy to privately and securely browse a
more open Internet to try toddle bear
for free go to total Vericom slash LTTE
to give you an idea of how big this case
is the box that it came in is big enough
for me to comfortably fit inside and hey
when you're this big there's a lot to
talk about so let's jump right into an
overview of the slate anyway
it features nearly 360 degree tempered
glass coverage safe for the angular top
brushed aluminum accents both of the
side panels rocked strong hinges with
magnetic catches and they open like
suicide doors from what I'm assuming is
extra style points
now most hinge side panels actually do
open this way but there's something
extra special feeling about these ones
maybe thanks to their sheer girth and
weight each air intake comes with what
are likely the largest slide-in air
filters of any case ever though I guess
that comes with the territory then
moving on to the inside there's mounting
for a whole heck of a lot of hardware
and since we have a lot more to cover in
this video we're gonna do this in
lightning round fashion here in no
particular order the slate has mounting
for two motherboards five GPUs eight
SSDs five hard drives thirteen fans to
quadruple 120-millimeter radiators a
triple 140 millimeter radiators two
power supplies and probably a dog or
three and believe it or not we're
planning to make use of all of that
space with full custom hardline water
cooling first some planning though yes
we plan let's talk about our parts list
and do a dry fit to ensure a that
everything is working and B that it will
actually all go in there so the final
system is gonna be kind of a mullet
business that's like content creation 3d
rendering etc in the front and then
party that's gaming in the back the
ultimate best of both worlds within a
single tower though like a mullet it
clearly won't be for everyone let's
start with the content creation rig in
typical ltte fashion it's the best of
the best
Intel's flagship 18 core 79 80 XE might
not be a great value for like Adobe
Premiere but it does allow for the
virtualization of four quad core systems
with two cores left over to run the
hypervisor and for 3d rendering and
blender it absolutely slays in the same
spirit of overkill how about for quad
rows with a serious amount of
motherboard to accommodate them all Asus
Rampage 6 Xtreme was up to the task with
all the PCI Express slots that we or
pretty much anyone could ever need
triple m dot two slots for some rated
480 gig nvme goodness 10 gig networking
and lots and lots of RGB actually our
plans are set to white for the color
scheme we have planned so haha take that
2017 to feed those 18 cores with sweet
sweet bits and bytes of course they're
somehow managed to get us a hundred and
twenty eight gigs of their vengeance RGB
it's not entirely possible that we are
single-handedly causing the continuation
of the global DRAM shortage so sorry
about that and then as for a GPU
choosing one was a bit of a challenge a
challenge in the sense that convincing
Alex to let us disassemble the 16k
gaming machine that he's been using as a
SolidWorks workstation since then was a
challenge not in the sense that we
actually had a ton of cuadros lying
around to choose from so these four p5
thousands they don't really match our
color scheme but they conveniently
support eqi's Universal 1080 waterblock
so that is going to be fixed by the next
video each GPU here has a cool 16 gigs
of vram and 2560 CUDA cores for our
power supply we went with a corsair ax
1500 i it's one of the only units on the
market that can handle everything in
this system then we added some sexy
white gray and blue cables from cable
mod onto our ITX gaming rig this one is
a whole other ballgame instead of
focusing on quantity like sake cores or
GPUs it's all about quality
now the core i7 7700 K isn't it
technically Intel's top consumer CPU
right now but with a little bit of
overclocking we aren't really making any
compromises here because like we're
still talking about 22 processing cores
in a single box the GPU was an easy
choice here we went for the NVIDIA GTX
1080 Ti which should handle gaming all
the way up to 4k resolution with
relative ease and then we actually
managed to get two more 16 gig dims of
Corsairs vengence RGB ddr4 bringing our
case total to a whopping 160 gigabytes
of RAM all that fits neatly into a Suzy
270 I which shares a similar monochrome
aesthetic with our rampage board and of
course has even more RGB which again
we're probably not going to use and then
this rig has to slum it with a single
480 gig MP 500 nvme SSD for the OS and
any important programs or games finally
it gets powered by Corsairs SF 600 power
supply which also gets the same cable
mod treatment to stay consistent with
the rest of the build while we're around
the back here
let's talk storage each one of our
systems will get its own triple 480 gig
SATA SSD raid 5 array for super fast but
not as fast as nvme storage then for
mass storage the main workstation system
has an additional 312 terabyte Seagate
iron wolf pro drives that could actually
be set up as an as for both rigs with
virtualization actually it could
probably serve the rest of the house too
if you're into that sort of thing even
with though all this incredibly opie
hardware the slate still looks almost
empty so hopefully water cooling
components and lighting will fill it up
a little bit more in part 2 but before
we get to that we want to show you guys
some baseline air-cooled numbers for our
rig as expected we're looking at pretty
good temperatures on the main system
with nocked who has NHD 15 on a 79
and then unsurprising GPU thermals for
cards that are installed this close
together our gaming system was a
completely different story though since
we could only fit a Noctua l9 I in the
space available temperatures on our 7700
K were basically pegged at a hundred
degrees even with the absurd 30 to 50%
throttling we encountered definitely no
thanks to the massive airflow
restrictions in the form of the four
Quadros and the 1080 TI hopefully though
we'll be able to do a little bit better
than both of them with a couple of d5
pumps and some thick radiators but again
you'll have to stay tuned for part two
for that speaking of part two have you
ever had one of your devices and it's in
two parts and you want to put them back
together
wow that was painful I fix it has got
the tools for you not to mention the
guides I fix it is all about helping
people repair and upgrade their devices
and their iconic black and blue pro tech
tool kit is now only 5995
it's got their 64 bit driver kit a wide
variety of opening tools sputters and
picks so you can safely poke and pry
their suction cup that makes it easy to
remove display assemblies and their own
rubber handled Jimmy pry tool along with
ESD safe tweezers metal spudger is an
ESD safety strap and a lifetime warranty
so go check it out over at ifixit.com
slash Linus and get your own fully
loaded pro Tech tool kit for just 60
bucks
honestly it costs less than paying
someone to repair your device once and
you can use it forever so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
maybe at weight get subscribe oh wow
there's like someone put a custom thing
in here something something water cooled
Beast something something oh yeah buy a
