actually a very cool product as well
this is a silverstone power supply it's
only a 450 watt power supply so how is
this relevant line as well the reason
it's relevant is this is their nightjar
450 watt zero decibel power supply this
is a fanless power supply it produces
zero noise it's an 80 plus power supply
and it better be if it's not going to
have a fan in it because the less
efficiency the more waste heat output
there is so if you have an efficient
power supply you're far more likely to
be able to build it without an active
fan taking away heat it has single pci
express 8-pin and dual pcie six pin
support for high-end GPUs alright that's
pretty cool 450 watts of continuous
output with 500 watt peak although you
better not use this outside of its spec
for very long because I mean it is
fanless it doesn't have a way to just
sort of ramp up the fan to make up for
any additional additional heat output
there is nothing on the back of the box
out here we go here's the overall ah
well wow this thing is actually really
heavy I'm actually I'm like having a
hard time holding it up while I talk
about it okay so this is a single 12
volt rail at 35 amps or 40 amp speak and
that so that can provide up to four
hundred and twenty watts of the total
450 watts that this power supply is
rated for so I'm going to go ahead and
put this down here I have never actually
seen this power supply before although
I've been curious about it and I've
wanted to see it for a little while so
we are having an a voyage of discovery
today that's for sure so the first thing
we'll find inside the box is the
silverstone optima to do okay some kind
of manual okay so this tells you a
little bit about your power supply it
tells you the physical characteristics
and whatever that seems really pointless
okay then we will find okay we'll find
another document that is completely
unlabeled ah this is the manual so this
shows you how to install the power
supply how to connect it to all of the
relevant parts of your computer that's
pretty useful actually thanks guys okay
next we will find a little accessory box
that has
a power cable in it ok so there's wow
that's actually a pretty nice pretty
beefy thick power cable it's if I could
just find it yeah I can't find what it's
sweet poor but doesn't really matter and
then next inside you will find more
stuff oh you don't normally have a whole
lot that comes with a power supply but
it looks like they've gone the whole
nine yards here and they have included
some oh they've included some plastic
zip ties as well as some screws for
mounting it they've also included some
ah some velcro tie straps for managing
your tables okay that's pretty cool I'm
not okay i have to confess I am
completely stumped I have no idea what
this is for it's some kind of bracket so
okay so they've included both thumb
screws and regular screws depending on
how you want to mount it in your case
maybe your case doesn't have room for
thumb screws at the back maybe there's
something blocking it so they've given
you all the different options there
which is very cool okay and then we're
pretty much left with the power supply
itself I suspect so that has a very
unique looking finish to it let me just
get this open here and I'll get the
plastic off it I mean this is the kind
of power supply that is perfect for a
media built or for a small form factor
built because the reality of it is most
computers are not using more than 450
watts 400 watts of power even gaming
machines and a big part of the reason
that many users use overpowered power
supplies for their systems is because
they want to keep the noise down because
an overpowered power supply isn't going
to have the fan working as hard so it
won't be as loud so I mean if you just
go with a 450 watt power supply in the
first place that doesn't have a fan well
then win-win right I guess the one
disadvantage is this power supply is
quite expensive so why don't we have a
look at the unit itself and then we'll
move on to the cables and this thing is
heavy okay so there we go see we've got
pretty much another another outline of
what we saw on the front so the rails on
the side this thing is all about the
about the vent
relation holes so you can see this side
of the power supply is completely
honeycomb mesh the top is a thick
aluminum heatsink that is also vented so
you can actually see right down into the
power supply but if you look at it from
the side this whole structure is all
heat sink okay so this is screwed on
with a couple of screws here dive around
to the other side of the power supply we
have more honeycomb mesh at the back of
the power supply we have more honeycomb
mesh and then we have our power switch
as well as our plug ok so then at the
front of the power supply we have guess
what more honeycomb mesh so this is all
about as much passive airflow as
possible and I want you to try and try
and look inside there you see those huge
heat sinks right here and right here
that is what is going to be cooling this
power supply so those appear to be
connected to the top and this is going
to be the majority of the cooling
surface of the power supply so if you
are using a unit like this or this one
in particular you want to make sure that
you're providing at least a little bit
of air flow to it where it's doing most
of its cooling you don't want to jam
this in a little box with like zero fans
because then you're just asking for
trouble so in terms of connectors on
this power supply we have a 20 + 4 pin
power connector ok so that plugs into
your motherboard that's terrific you
would pretty much expect any power
supply to have that in terms of PCI
Express connectors we have oh wow
they've given you a whole lot of options
for PCI Express connectors this is oh no
they haven't nevermind this is a 4 plus
4 pin power connector so that's for your
CPU ok I'm just going to adjust this a
little bit so that I can hold it more
comfortably there you go so that can
come apart if you're using just a four
pin motherboard which the odds are
pretty good you would be doing if you're
using like a media oriented motherboard
or a small form-factor motherboard then
you have six plus two pin and another
six pin so this I mean I really like
these cables the ones that are like this
because the reality of it is most people
are using one GPU so if you have one GPU
even if it has 26 pin connectors or an 8
+ 6 pin connector you run just one wire
to it perfect love that ok then in terms
of say two connectors you've got a whole
lot of them so imagine that imagine like
a media oriented power supply needing
lots of hard drives Wow go figure
so there you go you got six SATA
connections three on each one of these
cables i want to give you sort of some
some perspective for the length here so
this is the power supply itself so these
are quite long so pretty much whatever
case you're using you're going to be
able to reach your hard drives just fine
and then you have a bunch more molex
connectors so we have two more cables
again here's your power supply here's
the length of the cable is very long so
one two three on each of those and then
two floppy connectors at either end
thank you for checking out my extremely
heavy unboxing of the silverstone
nightjar 450 watt power supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
