going to seem like kind of a random one
because I actually just recently unboxed
what is the faster better stronger
replacement for this particular product
the reason I'm unboxing this one is I
want to do an NCIX tech tips episode
comparing the older 300 megabits per
second version which is this guy right
here the te w 647 GA against the newer
better 687 GA which is a 450 megabit per
second wireless end product so I'm going
to start with my unboxing night by
breaking the seal along this side of the
product here there we go gonna open that
up and it's going to be hard for you
guys to see what's on this box with this
glossy shrink wrap covering on it can't
slip that off there we go alright so
what is trying to have to say for
themselves about this product well it
has a one touch setup button led status
indicators reset button on the bottom
land port and a power connector okay my
understanding is that the land port on
this guy is actually ten hundred so
that's going to be a bit of a
performance limiting factor compared to
the gigabit port on the 687 here's some
related products they're talking about
so you can use this they're called the
wireless and gaming adapter oh there's
nothing particularly gaming about it it
can be used for a pc or are we using a
USB adapter or a PS ps3 xbox or a pc or
television or whatever any kind of
ethernet network enabled device you
happen to have so Wi-Fi compliant works
with BGN devices works with pretty much
anything enhances performance for online
gaming ok right i mean it's probably not
better than a network connection but you
might be better off with this then with
you know some cheesy USB wireless
adapter depending on the situation ok so
they're saying 4x the coverage of g and
12 times the speed of g ok and that's
pretty much it for the outside of the
box so let's open up the box and find
out what's inside i suspect i already
know what's going to be inside but lee a
disk emmanuel a product of any fernet
cable and a power adapter but
find out just for fun so here is the
setup wizard users guide so that's not
actually a driver disk so you might want
to check that out find out what's on
there next we have a quick installation
guide which is at two pages long
apparently in English oh no no there's a
few more pages so to show you how to
connect it to your router setup password
all kinds of good stuff in here alright
next we find a power adapter as expected
an Ethernet cable as affected as well as
the 647 GA now what I didn't expect and
then I'm going to like totally show you
guys the floor of the tech tips from
here here's the 687 GA I did not expect
a size differential here so the yeah the
647 GA is absolutely dwarfed by the 687
GA it's like just yeah look look at that
I like hold these really far away to
even show you the 687 where's the 647 is
like tiny so that's one thing the 647
has going for it its small size here's
our Ethernet port here's our power in
here's our glossy finish where you can
see my chest mounted tripod camera set
up here is the wireless indicator land
indicator as well as power indicator
some trendnet branding on the side like
their glossy black outsides they're
using on their current products versus
the like cheesy blue ones they had on
their old ones these are really nice
here's our connect button and then on
the very bottom there is a little tiny
pin point that's the reset button so
unless there's something else in here if
there isn't thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the TW 647 GA and stay
tuned for my test of this guy versus
this guy and what wireless 450 megabit
per second actually brings to the table
over an old wireless 300 megabit per
second adapter</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
