I almost got is better graphics it
doesn't even have the damn 4k blu-ray
player but if I wanted to spend $400
every three years for better graphics
and non-cinematic frame I've now got PC
this well you know what I say amen
brother
we heard all the outraged console gamers
out there and got on the phone with D
brand to devise a plan so if you don't
want to buy a ps4 Pro why not just water
cool your ps4 end make it look dope AF
while you're at it so let's get down to
it then welcome to PlayStation 4 water
cooling
so this journey began over six months
ago when my son and I sat down and tore
down the ps4 looking for the best way to
tackle this problem then I got busy with
other projects and handed it off to Jake
who promptly did what any sane person
would do and taped a thermal probe using
a non conductive thermal paste to the
back of the mainboard and reassembled it
he chose this position because placing
the thermal probe on the apu directly
would have affected the contacts between
the heatsink and the apu itself and the
purpose of this disassembly reassembly
rig Murrell in total it was completely
torn out and put back together twice and
will need to do it one more time to get
our thermal probe out at some point
sorry Jake was to get baseline
temperatures so we could determine how
well our DIY water cooling solution
worked so I don't expect too many people
to replicate this project and if they do
I'd imagine they'd have some idea how to
go to ifixit.com and find a ps4 teardown
to follow along with but since we've got
all the footage of taking it apart I'll
leave it to my editors to give you guys
the highlights until we reach the good
stuff ah here we go
with the motherboard removed we get our
first good look at the thermal compound
on the AMD APU that functions as both
the CPU and GPU core for the PlayStation
4 so we replaced this with a pea-sized
amount of IC diamond for both our before
and our after tests let's fast-forward
again for a little bit here really
that tiny heatsink does all of the
cooling for the PlayStation 4 so that
then is what we'll be replacing with an
ek supremacy GPU block by the way shout
out to ek for providing our liquid
cooling gear by drilling through the
rivets here with a couple of different
sized bits next we needed to cut away
the motherboard tray with some aviation
shears we actually ended up needing
straight right and left angle for this
but I guess you could just use a dremel
then we routed zip ties through the
block through the motherboard and
through the tray proceeding to cut a
hole into the
I to the PlayStation 4 for our tubing to
read through please note that we don't
generally recommend attaching fittings
to tubing then screwing the whole thing
into a block it is very easy to
accidentally cause it to come loose and
leak when the tubing moves but we didn't
have many options here and it was the
best way forward with the tubes
installed it was time to reassemble the
ps4 but we needed to make sure our block
was securely mounted first hmmm that
single Zab strap didn't really seem to
cut it but with four or five pieces of
squishy double-sided tape we were able
to compress the stacks slide them in and
let them expand giving us a surprisingly
good mounting solution that not only
held the block in place but also
supplies adequate pressure between the
block and the APU so far so good fast
forward again - are they really going to
do that yes my friends during reassembly
we swapped out the stock 500 gig hard
drive
for a 3.8 4 terabyte samsung PM 863 SSD
making this the highest internal
capacity and possibly the most expensive
PlayStation 4 ever at about $3,000 all
told now by this point some of you have
probably realized that we didn't manage
to mount a radiator pump or reservoir
inside the ps4 s chassis it's possible
that this could be done but given how
cramped the ps4 already is with its
smaller size similar power to the Xbox
one and internal power supply it
wouldn't be easy no problem though proto
case to the rescue so the first step was
to do up an initial design in Sketchup
which we sent to proto case to
mechanically design and to manufacture
those guys are great at what they do the
footage you're looking at now is from
their amazing metal shop that they use
for rapid prototyping and even some
larger scale manufacturing there was a
small design oversight on our part that
forced us to run the radiator in pull
rather than push but
that it worked great we load it up in
ekx res 140 with a pre-attached d5 pump
using a custom mount from our 3d printer
a cool stream SC 120 millimeter slim
radiator a bunch of ek fittings some
primo chill black tubing and a sky
slim 120 millimeter fan then at this
point we sent the mostly finished system
to D brand for one of their sexy vinyl
skin jobs those guys mostly do phones
game consoles and accessories and
computers but they're always up for a
challenge and I think they did an
amazing job of the external water
cooling box let them know over on
Twitter if you agree we'll have that
linked below and be sure to check out
their configurator which we'll have
linked in the video description next
time you need to personalize and protect
a device whether it's an iPhone or a
monstrosity such as this one anyway
surprisingly with it all put together no
leaks which leads us to moment of truth
time will the PlayStation 4 boot and
success it still turns on but did we
improve our temperatures the answer
again is yes unfortunately for those of
you who legitimately thought water
cooling might help you avoid a ps4 Pro
upgrade this won't do anything for
performance at all but a 16 degree
improvement in temps while staying near
silent is still a pretty fantastic
achievement at least we think so so
thanks for watching guys if you dislike
this video I guess you could do that
thing but if you liked it hit that like
button get subscribed maybe even
consider checking out our links in the
video description where you can learn
more about dbrand
you could buy a PlayStation on Amazon
we'll have that down there as well or
whatever the case may be also linked in
the description is our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join now that you're done doing all that
stuff you're probably wondering what to
watch next so click that little button
in the top right corner to check out our
latest video over on channel super fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
