or Core i5 processor and get a free copy
of Rome 2 total war click now to learn
more the AMD Radeon r9 290 when it
launched to turn the graphics card
market pretty much on its ear by
delivering performance competitive with
the then $700 plus GTX 780 at $400 there
were some issues however power tune is
AMD's technology that balances power
consumption clock speed temperature and
fan speed so while the card is
advertised to run it up to 947 megahertz
it and it's big brother the 290x often
runs into thermal limits causing clock
speeds and voltage to scale down so they
don't actually run at the speeds on the
box in games this throttling behavior
could be blamed on a couple of things
one of them is the high heat output of
the Hawaii GPU with its massive 6
billion transistors the other is the
lackluster reference cooler with its
loud fan that forces end-users to choose
between hairdryer lake noise or throttle
performance now whatever you want to
blame it on there were a few things that
were very clear number one is that the
r9 290 already performed very well
against the GTX 780 which prompted
Nvidia to drop prices only down to 500
mind you but it was a drop number two is
that we won't have a clear idea of what
the card is truly capable of until we
get better coolers in the form of twin
frozer or direct Cu to class coolers
from guys like MSI and a soos even with
custom air cooling though we'd have no
way to know for sure whether any thermal
throttling was occurring we've observed
both good and bad things about Nvidia's
GPU boost 2.0 which is similar to AMD's
power tune a good thing about it is that
unlike AMD they provide a base clock so
you'll have a reference point for the
minimum performance you'll be getting if
you buy the card one bad thing we've
noticed however is that while GPU boost
2.0 provides end-user customization and
allows you to change your thermal limit
manually for example from 80 degrees to
95 degrees it seems to be actually
just doing whatever it wants in the
background so yeah you can change it but
it's just throttling anyway so we wanted
to remove all possibility of thermal
throttling and liquid cool the cards
fortunately we contacted khulus who
hooked us up not only with the water
block that fits on either the r9 290 or
the 290 X you can check the link in the
video description for pricing and
availability of the gear we used in this
video but also a GTX 780 block a pump a
reservoir and some awesome awesome quick
disconnect fittings that let us do very
fast graphics card swaps on our first
ever liquid cooled test bench in fact
guys I just disconnected a tube here
that's completely full of water and we
got no leakage whatsoever alright moving
on to the test we used the Maximus 5
formula with a 3770k at 3.9 gigahertz
eight gigs of ddr3 memory at 1600
megahertz and a PC power and cooling
1200 watt power supply as always our
graphics cards were overclocked as high
as they could go on both air and water
and we used two separate liquid cooling
loops for the CPU and for the graphics
card so we could isolate the heat
generated by the GPU so we could remove
variables when evaluating them in terms
of their thermal performance if you guys
want to see the clock speeds we were
running out on the graphics cards there
will be a link to our chart in the video
description below our results surprised
us a lot we were like everyone on the
entire internet expecting the r9 290 to
overclock like a beast and destroy the
780 out of which we were expecting only
a mild performance improvement now
because we traditionally set our 780 295
degrees on the thermal limit for an
apples-to-apples comparison against AMD
cards and it only ever runs at 80
degrees we assumed that there was no
additional Headroom to unlock with
better cooling because we were never
hitting our user-defined thermal limits
but it turns out that for liquid cooling
enthusiasts and videos monkey business
with the user adjustable thermal limits
turns into some pretty good performance
gains for that card when it's running
underwater as well so first up is
thermal performance both cards ran
between 35 to 45 degrees Celsius under
load with the 780 being closer to 35
in the 290 being closer to 45 when it
comes to gaming performance we only
really tested a couple games because
what we were looking for in this video
was performance scaling from air to
water so a huge library of games wasn't
really necessary what we found is that
the max overclocked performance of the
GTX 780 improved by just under 10% and
the max overclocked performance of the
r9 290 improved by about 7% that means
that basically when you're out there
shopping and deciding between these two
cards with the intention of going water
you can basically look at any
performance comparison chart and factor
in another five to ten percent for each
when you're doing your value analysis on
the subject of value in performance this
video is a great example of why I don't
talk about pricing for products in my
videos the r9 290 launched at $400 which
would have made it a clear winner
against the $500 GTX 780 in this
particular showdown but it now costs
$500 to making it exactly the same price
but with higher power consumption and
higher heat output so for the gamers out
there the GTX 780 gets the nod from me
at the moment but there are things other
than games and AMD's cards are well
known to perform incredibly well against
their Nvidia counterparts in some
compute applications one example of
which being cryptocurrency mining and
folks are buying up AMD graphics cards
by the truckload for bitcoin and
litecoin mining and that's been causing
some serious changes to the retail
pricing as I outlined before so
ultimately it'll be up to you the viewer
to look at the performance numbers then
check out the values that we're showing
you in terms of what you can expect when
overclocking then check out the links to
the cards in the video description to do
the value calculation for yourself if
you're curious guys you can see the
overclocked values for our graphics
cards in the Google Doc linked in the
video description
remember that overclocking is always a
crapshoot and you may get a card that
overclocks better than ours you may get
one that overclocks worse than ours and
there's no guarantee for any of that
stuff so anyways guys I hope you enjoyed
this video on the removal of thermal
limits from the r9 290 and the GTX 780
let us know in the comments if the
results surprised you
or if they were what you expected like
the video if you liked it dislike it if
you just like to de nos always Bob's
doing really good up till there as
