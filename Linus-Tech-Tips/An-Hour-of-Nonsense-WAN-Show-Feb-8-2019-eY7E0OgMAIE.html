time again that is to say it was when
show time 22 minutes ago but in fairness
to us this is actually the closest we've
been to on time in about a month
I love how at the time was 4:30 so we
always went live at 5:00
yeah another time still technically 4:30
but we kept on hitting 5:00 so then we'd
yeah so acting like it was 5:00 well
Colton went rogue that's what actually
happened yeah do you do you know this
part of the story he changed the
thumbnail he changed it and he changed
the description so that he he basically
unilaterally without any prior
authorization for management changed the
landowner five o'clock start which means
then he made a mistake he told me yeah
he told me it started at 5:00 now and I
was long ago okay so I'm gonna head down
there at 5:00 and then so today I had a
new laptop so that I won't accidentally
leak any information on the show anymore
so I had a new laptop tube setup and
then I had to do the thumbnail and then
this computer got signed out of a bunch
of stuff and then here we are 22 minutes
later and it's time for us to be honest
with you guys because we've actually
gotten a lot of really negative and or
angry feedback over the last few weeks
about the state of our titles and
thumbnails for the land show you know
people have said hey you guys put this
topic in the title and you barely talked
about it now in fairness to us that used
to happen a lot even back when we did
talk about tech news on the show there
was times where we literally would not
talk or we would completely forget about
it
but people are particularly upset
because over the last month or two when
show has gotten to the point where we
talk very little about any tech news
regardless of whether it's in the title
of the video or not so today we're
leveling with you guys the show is just
going to be an hour of us being with
each other and we might talk about some
tech news
we do have some topics for you guys the
NYPD is apparently mad at Google there's
been a crackdown on facial recognition
in Australian schools the FBI conducted
a sting operation on huawei at CES this
is hilarious and I'd actually really
like to talk about that one there's a
rumor of an upcoming gtx 1660 TI
whatever the crap that would be okay so
that you can overclock your switch
apparently right that's thing if you're
into that sort of thing that seems like
a good idea so that was a list of topics
that we may or may not talk about and
intermixed with all that might be
discussion of luke's beard which really
hasn't improved since last week and you
what sorry i got to deal with yeah you
you do okay you know what let's roll the
intro let's reel the intro because we
forgot to roll the intro at one point
people are mad about that too why
what now - says Luke Spears oh no kami
Eibach says Luke's beard looking mighty
fine
so I think I think I'm gonna give it one
kind of chance yeah where I'm gonna try
to clean it up now
okay and how what exactly is your plan
to clean it up because right now you've
got this whap sided thing going on here
yeah it's really hard to shape it right
so I'm gonna try to like cut it into
shape which probably isn't gonna work
okay cuz you know that the entire
comments section of I think it was last
week's wine show was basically beard
advice for you right no you got a comb
it like this way and then you got to do
that you gotta use like a conditioner
you get it yeah there was like a bunch
of product recommendations for stuffy
who I was talking to they just don't
know you very well anything more
complicated than like a bar of soap
doesn't touch this man he's a simple man
I just yeah I don't know people have
asked me for any kind of soap that don't
come in a bar that's too messy okay
do you use conditioner no no I have do
you hold on on accident thought it was
shampoo do you use shampoo yeah really I
just know I am poo for my whole body I'm
gonna body wash for everything is this a
TMI moment about how much hair you have
is it more just your belief that soap is
soap so mess or your cleaning stuff
therefore whatever has the highest
volume yeah so per dollar is therefore
superior Costco so I feel like
three packs you buy like six at a time
you don't go back for a year I have to
confess I am just as bad as you but the
other way so for me it's bar so I don't
own shampoo okay the shampoo bottle is
for my wife I don't touch it
no and and I I just I just use the bar
for soap your hair yeah oh I didn't even
know that was like no yeah I guess yeah
is soap not soap yeah and like it's not
like I keep my hair for very long yeah
like I kind of gets long enough that
lets so it's funny thing so I ran into
trouble with my kids because my
daughter's in particular well they have
longer hair than me and so when they're
babies you just use like this infant
like general wash yeah and you know they
have like they have really short hair
and they have really delicate skin and
blah blah blah so you just use this like
infant wash sure and use it all over
anyway just out of not feeling like
searching for another product if it's
good enough for an infant it's good
stuff for a 3 or 4 year old
I just kept using it on them and my
eldest daughter's hair got to the point
where it was just like straw coming out
of her head
and I was like light bulb moment
conditioner right I will like there was
one time I accidentally grabbed a bottle
of conditioner and put it in my gym bag
okay and then went to go have a shower
at the gym if you conditioned your whole
body how was that it was so weird
because it's like really like I don't
use conditioner so I don't know but it's
like oily is it it's more oily pretty
sure yeah yeah so then I like I didn't
look at the bottle and I like squished a
bunch into my hand and put it in my hair
and then like tried to transfer around
it was like what defense they looked
very similar in a lot of cases yeah and
I was I was highly highly confused but
yeah people have asked me many many
times what I do to my hair I'm like yeah
it's it's water in the shower and then I
go flop and then I leave the house so if
it can't be that easy I probably
shouldn't do it which is why I'm
probably gonna trim the beard
No yeah so uh one of the reasons that I
brought this up is another youtuber who
I believe own Miller with Phil DeFranco
launched a hair product what yeah so I
was just gonna say like if we ever get
to that point you'll know that we either
had outside consultation or you just
shouldn't buy it it's just like it's a
it's in like the shape of a shampoo
bottle but it's just like three bars of
soap the entire sales pitch would be
like it's cheap you just buy it like
really affordable your supply at a time
yeah yeah it's green trust us it's not
Irish Spring yeah I don't know so that's
okay I have I have a funny story yeah
you know you've complained mildly about
my shoes I've had the same pair of shoes
yeah nope yeah I was gonna say toe is
doing on one of them but this isn't
weight sorry I was gonna like this story
no oh I see just a story okay let me
guess I mean yeah okay I'd like to I'd
like to guess what happened here so for
reference its it's supposed to it's
supposed to be know what the shoe is
suppose I think everyone knows but this
is not what a shoe is supposed to guess
I got a guess okay does it involve like
a campfire no actually but that makes a
lot of sense but no no I see where that
was yeah well informed though and this
is like oh it's how are you wearing this
today no I don't have other like these
are really light yeah I know they're
great this is why I have a really hard
time replacing them the back is
destroyed oh yeah like I need new shoes
yeah now I especially in the initial
yeah and like this isn't quite a whole
but it's definite
all the way through like the first layer
here yeah others many many many holes
how could its the toes okay I thought
you were gonna I thought you were gonna
tell me no there's also a huge groove
that's on the bottom that's new it is it
heat-related though uh there there yeah
there was he there was he there's
technically he okay there's also a lot
of movement wait were you like being
dragged behind something can I give you
a pretty powerful hint fine I wasn't
wearing them they got stuck in something
and yes curled up yeah and it was there
was heat involved yep you're getting
really close there's like a molded thing
put them in the dryer yes I'm like high
heat so okay though the actual problem
is that it jammed itself between the
side wall and the like the three arms
that are in the I don't know what they
call the three panels that are in the
dryer and it was like stuck in there
minded itself around that's why there's
like a groove in the bottom and it's
bent over and stuff it wasn't like high
heat it that's from like friction
molding like it's the dryer was like I
don't care you're going around the
circle so yeah I'm gonna have to finally
buy any shoes I can't believe you're
still wearing them today like when did
this happen last night okay
alright so this weekend that's your
that's one of my tasks is to get new
shoes so I said get toe shoes
what are too old oh oh I did but the
problem is they are also higher
maintenance what do you want to maintain
about toes okay one if you don't wash
them all the time
like they stink unless you get the socks
if you get the socks the socks are
really expensive yeah
and they like take a long time to put on
I guess you have to get each one of your
freaking toes mentioned the drawback
that you look like an idiot
you do okay I'm just checking yeah but I
actually really like them a lot I have
like part of my like knee problem with
wow this is great this is like what toe
shoes look like in the marketing
materials
what toe shoes look like on your feet
they don't look like no because they go
up higher those are like those are those
are weird they're all weird
those are exceptionally weird Ed's super
into them ed likes the toes I like them
so they they help my knees a little bit
I find a little bit because I don't know
if you remember I used to run barefoot
all the time
yeah convincing you to put on any amount
of clothing at work was kind of a
challenge
okay fair different story but yeah I
used to run barefoot all the time so
that made it so I could run barefoot
with a little bit of protection as I
stepped on something that was the idea
so yeah I've also met people that not
only thought they look stupid but we're
like personally offended by them
personally as they like really really
really hated feet and because they could
like see the separation of the toes it
like looked more like an actual foot and
it like disgusted them how do people
like this shower I mean look at your own
yeah yeah like how do you I didn't
address it at the time but I was like
that legitimately has to be a little
difficult yeah how's your week this week
it's been pretty good actually
it doesn't seem like yours was I'm
assuming by the exasperated sigh I don't
I don't remember I actually don't
remember much from this week so we we
did a bunch of videos obviously yeah um
some of the ones we did are actual
pretty cool I don't have my regular
laptop so unfortunately I can't I can't
see my list of them but um what was the
one that we did in my office it was cool
oh oh I started working on one that I'm
pretty excited about so red and NVIDIA
came out and said that they were working
together to have r-tx cards accelerate
actually Adobe was involved as well so
to have r-tx cards accelerate working
with 8k red footage in Adobe Premiere in
real time so you can actually use the
GPU acceleration on the r-tx card
specifically to get smooth 8k video
playback at one to one while you're
editing and I thought that was really
cool so we're actually gonna be doing a
piece fairly soon on what exactly that
looks like and over the course of a
couple of days I finally got my test
bench working which involved three CPUs
two motherboards
three sets of RAM two graphics cards I
don't know what its deal was but I think
a CPU managed to just die okay it was
one that had been previously deleted and
it had been sitting in storage for a
while okay I actually wonder if the
liquid metal seeped out and then is
contacting something inside right now
like honestly anyway we've got a piece
coming on that but I want to talk a
little bit about liquid metal actually
cuz we've had there was a post it was
either on the forum where I saw it on
someone tagged me on Twitter where they
were talking about an issue they were
having with their laptop that they had
liquid medaled so not deleted in this
case because laptop CPU still have bare
dies but they had liquid metal did I
think it was like six months or a year
prior or something like that they
suddenly had issues with it they took
the thing apart removed all the liquid
metal that was on it put regular thermal
compound on it fired it up and it booted
up again and I just want to kind of like
address this again because even though I
feel like we made it really clear in the
videos that we did at the time people
seem to be still running around
and putting liquid metal on their
consumer electronics be they phones or
laptops or whatever else we said in the
videos and I want to say it again we
don't recommend that it's actually a
pretty bad idea because anything that's
going to be stored in a vertical
orientation especially anything that's
going to be stored in a vertical
orientation when it will be warm runs
the very real risk of having the liquid
metal seep out and make its way on to
other things because it doesn't
necessarily behave like water would
where it has a lot of surface tension
for example where even if it was a
liquid like it would be unlikely to to
just kind of ooze out or crawl over
things liquid metal is nasty freakin
stuff and so like putting it on
something like a phone is basically
asking for your phone to die yeah so
that's what I have to say about that oh
we also did this was this was great I
guess we'll see how people like it we
also did a video where I read me in
comments for the first time that's okay
do you like respond to them sometime I
felt like I kind of had to they were 10
out of 10 very mean ah
I put James in charge of it so he picked
them he he hand-picked the meanest
comments that he could find were they
like personally offensive or were they
like Gary personal oh they went after
everything from my voice to my looks to
my mannerisms to my mannerisms oh yeah
oh for sure yeah I haven't seen one of
those oh oh oh yep you may enjoy the
video you may enjoy the video I don't
think I will be like this isn't you
you've heard me say this since the start
of us working together so you know this
but I've never seen those things right
like people have complained about your
voice and didn't you say like someone
hated editing your videos even right now
about my voice being annoying that never
made me think
ever once understood that I don't know I
find it annoying so I think they don't
remember eyes don't be telling you yeah
I find it annoying and that's why it's
so hard for me to edit anything that I
host maybe yeah because I remember we
were like in the office at ncx talking
about it and be like I don't know you're
dying but it's fine
I don't find it as bad now and maybe
it's just because I've also gotten more
used to it okay or maybe it's because my
my manner of presenting is is it
possible that voice is also just
naturally deeper we have better
microphones and better microphones
that's probably a significant part of it
is we have across-the-board better
microphones for everything we do
honestly one of the biggest upgrades
that we made in the last little while
every last I have to take this off I
always wear this microphone home it
drives me nuts
I'll get in my car and that's what I'll
realize because sitting down with it is
kind of uncomfortable yeah I'll be like
oh I'm wearing the bloody microphone
again or you have the clicker or you
know I don't have the prompter in my
pocket pretty funny it's really annoying
because it wears it out and it's already
I've had to kind of like reinforce this
thing up here cuz this is like your
drink this is a fiver yeah yeah that's
my heat shrinking job it's really bad
because I used like this really stiff
heat shrink that doesn't really fix the
problem because if you're trying to
implement a strain relief and you just
move the strain really just some worlds
yeah you move the point of strain
somewhere else then you're you're just
prolonging the inevitable you're not
actually preventing it from being
damaged so what I really need is I want
to get like a bunch of those you know
those really little Springs like they
have on pens yeah so I want a bunch of
those that are just the right size for
our cables and then I want some nice
flexible flexible
moss yeah that's a pretty good job I'm
not trying to like plug our own sponsor
but yeah there's a few different
companies I've done stuff like that
unfortunately you don't get to pick the
cable for like a syncing microphone like
this anyway so the thing that bothers me
is that I'm unnecessarily damaging it
and this is like twenty five hundred US
dollars worth of audio gear but I don't
regret it at all cuz this has
been one of the best upgrades that we've
made sound is super important yeah it's
like actually really really important we
still don't always get it very right but
at least but at least generally speaking
on the videos now we get it more right
than we used to a lot of people you know
there were a lot of comments on the on
the 10 years of LTT video did you watch
it by any chance I did you did yeah
there were a lot of comments on it I
want your thoughts in a moment but there
were a lot of comments on it that people
were like you know the reason people are
harkening back to the old days isn't
because of the production values in fact
it's because the content was better I'm
like okay okay I see your point but one
thing that I wish we had found as we'd
gone back and looked for examples of
production gear upgrades was the videos
that I would personally stitch together
and forget to put the audio in both
channels because a lot of the time I'd
be doing it on speakers and I wouldn't
realize that you you you just took all
the blame for a problem that every
single person did at that point in time
so thanks mr. boss but I did it too and
it happened from other people that were
editing videos at the time as well it
happened a lot on our channel to the
point where like it was a consistent
complaint in the comments section people
like how are you guys still doing this
like years later how is this still a
problem because there were so many
videos where audio was only in one
channel that is absolutely a thing and
there was there was lots of other
problems as well so to be clear we're
not saying like production values are
the be-all and end-all to better content
I'm just saying that they were when I
was saying it was hard for me to go back
and watch that stuff I meant it was so
bad in ways that were entirely
preventable there's I think I think
there is some justifications to the
comments as well though not I don't
necessarily think the content was better
I think that's an overgeneralization and
possibly a misdirection of them assuming
something because they they don't
necessarily fully understand the problem
I'm not I'm not sure I'm just saying it
happens a lot yeah there was a comment
or
earlier about people saying something
about something and it was like knowing
from the inside I'm like kay that isn't
actually the problem but I see why you
would think that Brett makes sense but
that isn't really what's going on
because what I'm gonna say here is we
were quite campy back then yes and it
might have felt a little it might've I
don't know it might have felt a little
bit more personal and campy and more
like just sharing friends making videos
yeah and it relates to a tweet I made
relatively recently where I like
everything will change over time like
the original Assassin's Creed games are
intensely different than the new ones
the original Battlefield games are
intensely different than the new ones
and they will lose sometimes what the
original identity was yeah yeah I think
that's fair you'll claim a new identity
like we used to do unboxing videos in
front of insects yes it's changed a bit
yes like the content is drastically
different I think that in particular
yeah I want is for the better sure but
it's different people might not agree
and they might have glommed onto that
and it could be a nostalgia thing where
if they actually watched if you actually
made those videos now in that level of
quality they'd probably be like they're
about those things I mean that's yeah
boards in power that's all something
that I think a lot of people forget is
that or don't think about is that maybe
their own tastes have also changed yeah
maybe if we actually started making
videos on boxing power supply's again
they would find themselves also very
bored by it in the same way that I got
to the point where we would sit down in
the garage with like a pile of stuff to
unbox that's often how the preparation
started yeah and I'd be like oh just had
a power supply hold on give me like a
couple minutes but am I gonna say about
this what could I possibly say there was
there was times we had to do like pep
talks
I'm not even it happened I don't know if
you remember but like there was there
was times where we had to do sort of pep
talks or like you would try to like get
amped up before we started the video
yeah like holy crap this is boring I'm
neither motherboard and we had
had to shift from the products that we
were getting were interesting enough to
drive the content yeah - we had to make
them interesting enough and that was a
big shift and that's something that the
industry did and we had to react to it
or we wouldn't have kept improving so
like there's there's things that had to
change because the industry change
there's things that should have changed
because their production quality things
there's things that change because the
company's way bigger now there's there's
there has been a lot of change so I
think it's not completely unjustified
for someone to say like yeah it's
changed but I think it's I think it's
objectively fit so what did you think of
the video I liked it
did you get the nostalgia feels yeah so
you think like there's there's I have to
like I look at it and for me like
certain sections are more important sure
or like for instance I wasn't in the
last chunk which makes sense cuz I left
for floatplane so like I cared more
about other parts or whatever right but
like the video was really good cool yeah
so you want to know something
interesting I didn't write it really huh
that kind of makes sense Ashley earlier
this week was actually the two-year
anniversary of the writing staff I mean
and I mean the bulk of it so yeah
Anthony Alex and James now Jake worked
here before that but it wasn't right
area and then John obviously has worked
here for much longer than that but he is
working almost exclusively on tech wiki
and tech linked so so so the actual like
the LTTE writing staff yeah two years
now and that was that video was a moment
for me because it used to be that people
would often comment on the videos like
that was that was honestly a big
difference change in production value
that we didn't address in that video
because it wasn't really gear related
but that was one of the biggest
different changes for me I mix it as a
content creator and at the time
especially in the first few months
people would would say in the comments
like this wasn't real boy alone this
wasn't written by Linus it sucks
I was even then I was still reviewing
the scripts and I was going through and
I was making changes but I've gone
through sort of periods of greater or
lesser interference in the work that
they hand in to me and I've also gotten
better at copy editing someone else's
work over the last couple of years so
I've gotten better at my job but that
script was really a fun one for me
because it showed it revealed to the
extent to which they have gotten better
at their jobs yeah so that's kind of a
cool like wasn't necessarily included in
the video but was literally a core
component of the video like it harkens
to them regardless that's pretty cool
yeah and and it's not just James like
those that wrote it it was James that
wrote it but those guys Tom really have
started to think about how to tackle a
project in a way that makes them less
like bench markers and writers and more
like content creators over the last
couple of years so I shot a video with
Alex today on the Coursera one and there
were a couple of things that he did
differently in the video then you know
back when he had started and the scripts
I would get from them were so like they
were cookie cutter they were rudimentary
so there's this flow to it where it
refers sort of back and forward to
itself as you go through along a couple
of different threads that's really it's
the kind of thing that you wouldn't
think about unless you're a gigantic
nerd and you're like reading the script
and going through it with the writer but
it adds a level of dynamism to the video
that otherwise wouldn't be there and I
find that stuff really helps to make it
feel like a story which really really
engages the viewer and the story is far
more interesting than just the speeds
and feeds yeah absolutely
sort of this black box yeah and then the
other thing was he actually thought
about what we could do production-wise
to make it look and feel a little
different than just another system
review and you know what's funny he
talked Brent somehow he talked Brandon
into a dual cam setup
one tripod just aimed at me why does not
and one tripod off to the side with with
a sorry I telephoto lens on it so that
we could get like close-ups of me
interacting with the product at the same
time and when I walked in and saw this
setup I was like huh what the heck that
is so similar to that thing that I can
now one key difference is that we aren't
trying to do it live to tape which means
the host is literally switching which
source the audience is looking at like I
was dope no you're talking about
there's no anyways that was so amazing
no no that was the pinnacle of creation
but I still I still got a real kick out
of it
that's fantast okay Peter dat seven I do
want to get back to this as soon as I am
able to any updates on your crazy new
internet connection I actually do have
updates for you but first we really do
need to go through our sponsors yep
first up is private Internet access this
show is brought to you by P ia actually
there was there was a big thing oh I
hosted tech linked today and right
ISPs were selling your like real-time
location data to all kinds of where do
wells including bounty hunters Wow yeah
okay but like so it's definition of
Bounty Hunter and the dog you know yeah
yeah yeah like not like so like arrest
you because you have a warrant for your
last oh okay yeah still I'm just yeah
some people in the audience might assume
like oh those are the guys that boba
fett yeah so yeah not quite but with
that but still so basically you should
be using a VPN all the time and yeah you
should be using a DNS server that are a
DNS service that is that doesn't log
your activity
and you should be doing kind of anything
you can to keep your activities private
and then what was the other big thing
right yeah there was another big one
Abercrombie and Fitch who else got
caught doing this
I was basically using their iPhone app
to screen capture purportedly to you
know record the way users interacted
with the app but they actually ended up
with like credit card information and
stuff Wow yeah to be clear I don't think
P ia would necessarily save you from
either of these situations wasn't
anything you can do at this point really
seems like something you should probably
but it's not hurting it and it's gonna
help you in other ways too which is
super so go check out P ia
l mggg slash p IA when this stuff is
getting ridiculous go check out tech
link for the full details on that stuff
and yeah i also brought to you by
madrenas oh so it's actually here I have
not tried it yet but I did promise them
even though I'm not really a coffee
drinker that I would roast the lambo
roast apparently it's pretty good
third-party reviews are in cool yeah
sweet so lambo roast is a specialty
crafted roasted coffee blended and
designed by madrenas coffee and lioness
tech tips so we actually had a bunch of
coffee lovers here on the team
contribute to this the African and Latin
American beans in this blend give this
roast a suite at chocolaty flavor with a
huge bold body and smooth caramel finish
so there you go guys you can check that
out at the link in the video description

oh they didn't bring anything for you
these are both maple buffalo bacon
that's okay I'm sorry Luke that's okay
I'm the only one who's going to be
eating any savage turkey today that's
okay you can do the you can do the
talking point okay if you'd like to sure
it's right there
so oh yeah I can just look savage jerky
actually no I'm gonna find my own savage
turkeys great they've been a sponsor for
a long time they don't use nitrates or
preservatives in their jerky I remember
that that's amazing
and they use the best ingredients with a
goal to create a snack that is full of
flavor and spice and isn't bad for you
and if it's maple buffalo bacon try to
keep it away from lioness because he
will take it
Linus his favorite flavor is maple
buffalo bacon it's great delicious and
he clearly can't stop eating it until
it's gone love it my personal favorite
is the Moho jalapeno grab yourself a bag
and other and maybe some other flavors
or try out some of their their hot
sauces really good I yeah they're hot
sauces are very good I've actually I
that bottle that I took is super gone it

that code everything is all good
boom I'm so happy right now because I
have a matinee buffalo bacon in a while
I ate it all and then there wasn't any
left did you only get two bags though or
is that just what's here I hope there's
more okay yeah okay so our new internet
our ISP I tell and tell us who like owns
the actual fiber all over the Lower
Mainland can't seem to get on the same
page about how exactly it's getting from
the D mark which is where it comes into
off the street which is actually another
building in this complex how it's
getting from the D mark to our building
Telus says I'm good Telus says that I
tell didn't do the right thing you know
splicing in three and four whatever they
said they've know what that means and I
was like okay and then I tell us
says tell us isn't really privy to how
their equipment works it has no idea
what the hell they're talking about
so right now I am as far as I know
supposed to have ten gigabit internet
now and I don't so that's the update on
the 10 gig Internet and I am like pretty
excited I thought it was five point one
five so it's five point five to the
general Internet okay yeah but it's 10
but it is actually 10 to everything at
Vanek's it includes AWS Akamai Google
basically anything that matters so
effectively it is ten gigabit internet
yeah and I want it and that's where I'm
at right now is there any rough ETA or
anything soon ok soon TM yeah ok there
are a couple of tech topics I actually
do want to talk about today so this is
hilarious this is supposed to by Daniel
T in on the forum and the original
article here is from Bloomberg and it's
like it's not actually related to a lot
of the Huawei stuff that's been in the
news lately yeah but it just kind of is
a really interesting look at how Huawei
is accused anyway of operating its
business so here's the summary Adam con
the inventor of Mirage Diamond glass
which is meant to be six times stronger
than Gorilla Glass sent a sample of his
product to huawei a potential customer
and you know it's funny on the tech
linked episode where we talked about
this some of the people commented under
the video look you're an idiot if you
send a pre-production product to huawei
of course they're gonna copy it well no
companies like Huawei and Apple and
Motorola and Google what will they
partner and they license technologies
from partners in order to make a better
product so no that's actually something
that you kind of have to do except that
instead of while we returning it when
they were supposed to and in the
condition that it was supposed to be in
they sent it back months later and badly
damaged so we had problem
to send it back within 60 days and to
limit and their tests to any that
wouldn't cause it damage this is pretty
standard in the industry and it's meant
to make it harder to reverse-engineer
intellectual property so the sample was
scratched cracked in half and had three
shards missing when it came back on an
FBI gemologist later concluded that
Huawei had blasted it with a 100
kilowatt laser that was powerful enough
to be used as a weapon so the FBI is
involved at this point they get Conn and
his chief operations officer Carl sure
baath has participated as participants
in this investigation of Huawei and they
asked him to travel to Las Vegas so this
is drinksy yes we were there like we
were down the street while this sting
operation is happening and asked them to
conduct a meeting with Huawei
representatives and they actually
secured a room at the LBCC this is the
convention center yeah and Bund it so
the FBI could listen in from another
location of the building so they bought
signage to make it look like a con had
rented out the space so sure Boff was
outfitted with surveillance devices and
recorded the conversation while a
bloomberg businessweek reporter watched
from a safe distance Wow
so finally this they didn't actually
confess to anything in the meeting but
on January 28th so this is about three
weeks later the FBI searched the Huawei
lab in San Diego where a cons glass had
been sent it was eventually forwarded to
China which they weren't supposed to do
and the FBI raid was a secret but not to
con insure baath who had been receiving
regular updates after it through their
lawyer um by then they had apparently I
didn't actually know this this is I
think is a newer development they had
succeeded in getting Huawei
representatives to admit on tape to
breaking the contract and to violating
US export control laws Wow
so the FBI this is how they figure into
all this they met with con tell him that
the bureau was hoping to educate local
startups
cybercrime and security vulnerabilities
and to encourage them to come forward
with suspicious activity and they were
trying to gather intelligence on Chinese
efforts to obtain us technology I was
gonna say it's probably more related to
that yeah yeah probably like heavily
more related to that it's interesting
it's also interesting that happened in
the convention center I know right like
you like we were we could have been like
there while this when I walked right
past where I did those rooms it's
probably just those little rooms in
South like I walked right now yeah yeah
that's crazy that's cool that's pretty
this is the kind of thing that like it's
cool that someone is actually like
standing up to this because the thing
about a contract is that it's only as
powerful as the entity that signed it
yeah and there and as their will to
enforce it because breaching contracts
is absolutely a thing okay i breached a
contract once probably more than once
accidentally oh okay I thought that was
a specific dick I was good no like oh
did I know okay okay I thought you meant
like there's something with no your
demeanor was like no sorry there's
something going yeah yeah oh you
destroyed me I'm assuming there are
contracts that you've broken so I
breached a contract once with a company
called student works painting I was I
thought you were gonna say like okay can
you get someone who knows coffee things
maybe get Alex Alex knows coffee things
know can you just ask Alex it'll be
easier just ask Alex Jake okay but
haven't you like since lmg times I
thought there was like an Nvidia thing
mmm oh okay like accidentally publishing
yeah a piece of content like technically
no me yes okay that's technically yeah
this is why I said probably more than
once yeah definitely
yeah okay but there was one time in
particular that I did it on purpose
oh because I was going over a period of
significant depression oh and I believed
that it was caused by my my job painting
houses or running that painting business
I asked them nicely to let me out and
they basically said you signed a
contract yeah that's it that's all there
is to it you have to finish the rest of
the summer but all I really wanted to do
was quit and go work at the computer
store and so I I worked through it with
my wife and we basically went yeah this
is pretty bulletproof even had a lawyer
look at it like a free legal counsel
through the city or whatever they were
like yeah you probably can't not do this
and finally I was like you know what I'm
not gonna go to work anymore and I think
that the optics of a student painting
company suing a student are probably bad
enough that they're probably not gonna
actually do that because that's a really
bad idea and that some interns yeah
that's something that I have actually
sort of relied on at points in my career
I will confess that during secret
shopper we did not fully vet the
legality of recording our conversations
is that it's an it single party consent
in Canada we will we did look into it
and it was questionable okay so single
party consent yes in Canada but that
doesn't necessarily apply to
conversations we're having outside of
Canada it could certainly be challenged
oh I thought it literally did but I
thought it was where the recording
happened anyways yeah our belief at
least my belief I actually had to fight
this battle internally my belief was
that the optics of you know someone
let's say someone that ended up not
looking that great like origin or
iBUYPOWER or del especially del the
optics of someone like del suing Linus
tech tips over exposing their customer
service agents outright lying to us
like was gonna be bad enough yeah they
probably weren't gonna do that so so I
guess what I'm trying to say is though
the law is only what is what someone is
willing to enforce please don't take
this as advice yeah it's not I am NOT a
lawyer and I'm not qualified to provide
any kind of I just wanna like make sure
we've got that yeah so I guess what I'm
trying to say is I think it's cool that
they're getting involved in what would
otherwise not be possible like in in
something that's happening that's wrong
a little startup yeah trying to deal
with what they wouldn't be able to
defend themselves they wouldn't be able
to enforce this contract against a
gigantic multi billion-dollar
multinational because even if they were
going to win it would be very very easy
and rather simple for Holloway they're
just be like Kate well this is gonna be
tied up in like a five-year or a get our
legal ragged house and we'll just bury
you with that so by then they'll have
been making insane profits selling this
reverse engineered glass already and
what do they care they can literally pay
for their involvement in this lawsuit
through the money they are stealing from
the patent that they violated yeah it
happens a lot actually yep yep so I
think that's cool there's one more news
topic that I did want to talk about but
Nick did you have something you want to
jump in with we don't neither of us
coffee how long 10 seconds well how's
this work I don't okay we don't we don't
coffee we don't know okay first 50 bang
okay cool
why do you why do you push down yeah
what are you doing right now what is
this straining the cop we're straining
the coffee okay you don't drink like oh
so the the coffee liquid is squishing
through that filter thing sure okay this
must be absolutely painful for people to
watch okay
is this so we're going straight from we
don't consume coffee at all to Jake is
just serving us black don't pour too
much in because I want it to cool down a
little yeah I'm gonna want to cool down
a lot so like give me less than that
that's fine that's fine that's fine
there we go I've always liked the smell
of coffee I've never been inclined to
drink it maybe twice in my whole life I
don't know like his cream or sugar
customary I should not drink it straight
so if I want it if I want it what what
are you even talking about Jake cool I
mean it's uh madrenas come that's nice
and light this is probably yeah legit
for camp I'm just I'm just gonna try it
hold on we're gonna do a couple of
really hot isn't it I have you you mean
we have to send you a play okay there's
one more news topic I wanted to do
beforehand we should also probably do a
couple super - oh wow we haven't done an
LTX update holy crap this show is never
gonna end
is there a blog update oh oh holy crap
ticket bracelet ticket pricing Oh John
will brought me a better coffee mug
here's my gamers Nexus coffee mug
fantastic thank you John oh I'll always
be shilling for gamers Nexus guys ticket
pricing for LTX is here so we'll be
using dream hacks preferred tix or
platform to sell and process tickets
this year they'll be sold in US dollars
this time sorry Canada and everywhere
else but to combat the dollar conversion
we have apparently lowered the cost of
the admission ticket
what it was last year so here they are
Saturday pass 30 bucks Sunday pass
sunday sunday sunday 30 bucks
two-day pass 50 bucks dreamhack
b-y-o-see plus two-day pass $80 in
response to the obvious question no you
cannot get b-y-o-see without a full
two-day pass yeah but that's that's for
fairly obvious reasons that is how that
should work just guys anyone wants to
complain that is like legit how that
should work alright
the LTX merch pack is 30 bucks that
includes a lanyard a t-shirt and and a
pin like an L TX pin it'll look a little
something like this and an LMG office
tour which is is that the day before
which which is on the Friday the day
before is 50 bucks I will be conducting
tours all day I guess pretty much ok
surprisingly cheap yeah it's about 15 20
bucks well we're gonna do groups of like
10 or 20 or something like that giving
the two yeah yeah yeah I'm just going to
do that all day the reason we're
charging is to control demand if you
guys honestly want to know why yes
because if we made it free then we'd
have literally three plus years ago we
made it free and we had a line up around
the building and we weren't able to
serve everyone and people were like
upset I don't even know if we had two
million subs at that point a fifth of
the size we are now so sorry
and then VIP which includes dinner and
what else does it include yeah yeah
there's like a little party here is it
here at the office yeah okay so you come
into the office and there's like a
hangout after work and specific VIP
merch I think they get a special hoodie
is that right different color t-shirt so
that's four hello
oh yeah the land center will be done by
then heck yeah
that's it no that'll that'll be done
cold for sure
for sure so here's a bunch
more information you guys can check it
out on the LTX Expo blog oh right yeah
here's what the pin looks like here's
what the t-shirt and the lanyard look
like all good stuff tickets go on sale
ah 12 p.m. Pacific time February 22nd so
also something that I wanted to make
clear is that these prices are the right
now prices we are going to be selling
tickets in waves and prices depending on
demand may go up if you want to come to
LT x and the Dreamhack land that's going
to be there buy your ticket do it fast
because there's a good chance it will
cost more we think there's going to be
very high demand we're we're trying not
to like be too optimistic but the number
of creators that I've heard back from
who have a strong interest in going
including some that are quite big has
been very encouraging I think that if
you're just not that into Linus Media
Group you might still want to be there
so one thing one interesting thing that
I'm going to point out which is probably
gonna be a big part of the reason why
people are gonna buy tickets faster this
year is the first two years the first
year was a pretty cool set of stuff plus
we got to hang out with Linus Media
Group crew the second year was like that
was about that good yeah there was a
ball pit the second year was like more
cool stuff and you get to hang out the
lines Media Group crew oh and some other
creators showed up which we didn't
necessarily know about until last minute
that's really cool and then this year is
like there's a land
there's tons of booths the VR section
got like multiplied by a billion its
Rheem hacks they're like everything's
been scaled up to such a ridiculous
degree that no matter what part of it
you actually want to go for if you want
to go to hang with lmg people there's
gonna be everybody there be there and if
you want to go there because the
conventions freaking sick then the
conventions freaking sick which is like
I don't know that's that's a really good
there's so much to do like it's this
this year's gonna be wild I'm so excited
all right I think I've said that enough
on the show are we doing this I want to
do one more top okay okay though the
rumor GTX 1660 TI so Nvidia was kind of
mad when the end of our our TX 2060
video we basically said well if you were
looking for a value card from Nvidia for
this generation wait for the rumored
upcoming something that will be without
RT X and now it looks like some of the
initial rumors were wrong in that it's
not going to have as many cuda cores as
the RT x 2060 so even in conventional
games it should be significantly lower
performing but it does look like there
is another card coming that will be have
the RT x stripped out of it and might
end up being a better value so it's
going to be based on the tu-160 in GPU
with 1536 cuda cores 6 gigs of GD r 6
and it will not have our TX no word yet
on tensor course the first listings for
MSI and palette cards have appeared on
Russian retail sites and I can talk
about this rumor because I don't have
any official word from Nvidia other than
getting mad at me saying that that was
unsubstantiated and you shouldn't trust
the rumors and I did they did get some
stuff wrong but it looks like there was
no line I think the worm the the rumors
weren't true at all now here's all the
numbers that you saw in the rumors on
screen behind me in that half with their
last major launch yeah sweet yeah all
right whatever man coffee then super
chats ok when's the last time you drank
coffee probably close to 8 or 9 years
ago okay I have sipped coffee once in my
life for the one of the like the manly
desk management video and I had to
borrow a mug from Burkle I think I think
Nick van Berkel made the coffee for me
because I had no idea how to make coffee
so I've been in yeah we used your truck
I've been in shots where I'm supposed to
drink coffee I just swapped it for water
yeah so ice is legitimately coffee I
forget why I had to I forget why yeah
can I can i whatever there's coffee
there's coffee in there alright so I'm
gonna try it and just because I don't
like it doesn't mean you guys might not
like it but there you go that's an
important note
neither of us are coffee drinkers nev us
and this is black it's pretty strong
I guess that's black how I don't drink
coffee I don't drink coffee either it's
better than the other one I had I was
just gonna say it's but it's like better
yes exactly okay I usually get the like
look from coffee that did not give me
that like it's I I was expecting it to
be like super bitter and I can I can
taste what they were talking about on
the bag we're gonna have not black
coffee maybe we'll do that next week
because realistically we're gonna have a
madrina spot to do next week anyway yeah
like it's way better than like whatever
garbage Nick van Berkel made for me
throwing endorsement right there even
people that don't like coffee are like
yeah that's all right
better than garbage yeah um yeah I can
also taste the undertones that they were
going for so that's pretty cool actually
there's some third-party reviews of it
already because the first shipment went
out and people seem to think it's pretty
good so nice yeah all right yeah couple
super chats Erik says who's gonna do the
voiceover for the Linus audio book come
on me obviously well when I do my book
I'm just gonna read it yeah yeah that
makes sense
so like the funny thing is I think I
have I talked to you about how I'm gonna
use like more like a podcast
subscription monetization model I'm
gonna release it chapter by chapter it's
gonna be the most blatant cash grab of
all time and then so the so the
audiobook is just going to be a podcast
that you subscribe perhaps no right you
should have your own channel on Flo
plain making everyone mad that's how you
should distribute it no I know right the
like Linus personal
so it's like yeah hey all the you know
the whole thing where you know - media
group makes revenue and then you know
takes that and just assign salaries to
everyone and like everyone kind of wins
when the company wins yeah forget that
nope this is the Linus personal job well
no you can still do that split
behind-the-scenes my grand soo Shadow
Zion shout out to you to Zion dials Oh
Everett says I'm applying for the grip
position just waiting on permit so how
many people applied whoa Oh for yours

that from people yeah
shoutout to zero hope to see you at LTX

no I'm just kidding someone asked for
flow plan updates there is notifications
in now we haven't been broadcasting it
like a ton because there's a bunch of
improvements coming to notifications so
there there's nicer things will be
happening with notifications but you can
get them now if you go to your settings
cog wheel in the bottom corner should I
do it sure should be fine ok yeah I mean
it should be there we go so settings cog
wheel settings not a creator CMS yeah
and then notifications and then you just
like click the bell and fill the Bell in
for the different things that you want
do you want push notifications do you
want email we should probably eventually
have a better explainer for that if you
want push notifications your browsers
gonna ask you like hey is this ok and if
you say yes you'll you'll you'll get
them that's pretty cool and by the way
our Bell like really works yeah it's not
miss or anything it's not that you to
buy theoretically yeah there's some
stylistic changes coming and there's
some improvements for how it looks and
feels overall also we don't have a
notification sound right now we will
eventually get a notification sound but
we need like a unique sound and that's
not something anyone and either of the
companies has really done so it's a new
new avenue to go down I've been doing a
lot of research on notification sounds
which is a weird thing weird weird thing
to research but I've learnt a fair
amount yeah
