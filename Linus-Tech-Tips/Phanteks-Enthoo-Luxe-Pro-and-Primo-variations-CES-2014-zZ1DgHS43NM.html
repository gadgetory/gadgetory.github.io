brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys we're here at
the fantex booth checking out a few
cases one of which Linus should have
reviewed by now but hasn't that's the
enthu primo and he will be getting to
that hopefully shortly after CES but for
now we have the luxe and the pro and a
few extra options for the Primo that
should be coming soon on the front panel
of the luxe we have two USB 3.0 two USB
2.0 mic and headphone in a reset button
a light changing button which I'll show
you in one second and a power button up
on the top which is not behind the
hidden door within the hidden door is
that light changing button so as you can
see there's LED bars around the case
which are not going to shine directly in
your eyes if this is almost anywhere
because they shine down onto the case
which is nice because we want to know
you weigh too much is it the rest of the
case is all black and black matches
quite literally everything so as long as
you go with black and then change to
whatever color you want it's gonna match
the rest of your belt moving to the top
of the case you can fit up to 420
millimeter radiators with this nicely
removable fan filter which is actually
quite solid sometimes with fan filters
I'm worried that they're gonna warp if I
take them off too many times so this one
seems quite solid moving into the case
we have our reservoir and quite nicely
displayed here more closer to the front
of the case mounted quite nicely on that
bracket but you could also put it in the
back just in case you have a really long
graphics card so they have a spot right
here which would work very well for you
just not in bolt to be able to bolt on a
radiator right there moving to the back
just so that we can see it easier but
you can access this from the front to
right in the middle of the front here
they have a nice plate for some pumps so
it's you can mount quite a few different
pumps there and that's really easily
accessible in a nice because it has
rubber mounting for the pump where
you're mounting the pump and it has
rubber mounting on the bottom of the
feet of the mount for the pump so it's a
nice vibration dampening they also have
a radiator here in the front which you
can mount there or lay it down at the
bottom and if you mount it here you
can't have any harddrive cages but if
you met at the bottom you could have a
hard drive cage hanging from right here
so you have a ton of different options
just in that small little area then
moving to the back of the motherboard
tray you have a PWM splitter at the back
which comes with it it's quite nice it
supports up to 11 fans which is solid
and you can get additional if I think
you just have to buy them as accessories
and then you could
split out to different areas and have
different temperature zones so say this
top radiator you only want the fans
going at certain speeds depending on
what temperature it is you can set that
area different than the radiator that
you have down here what if you want to
do if you get different modules for that
they also have SSD mounting spots so if
you do like their configuration here
where you don't have the hard drive
cages you can mount SSDs just right on
the back of the motherboard or down here
as well they also have an adapter plate
to hide the power supply in the basement
and their current configuration that
wouldn't work because you'd hit some of
the tubing and some of the fittings and
stuff but if you felt like being crafty
and going along with this configuration
you could cut this guy a little bit and
then make it fit and it works really
well with the case because it looks
exactly the same and there is rubber
grommets built into the side which is
really fancy minuses full-featured
coverage of them through primo is coming
so we'll just be kind of going over the
newer options that they have here first
of all they have a standard white one
now and then for special editions they
also have orange and white and red the
orange and red will all of them to be
completely honest have a sandblasted
aluminum style not a brushed aluminum
which I like quite a bit because your
fingerprint burnin is not nearly as bad
there's been cases in the past where
I've built them wearing those like weird
white gloves just because I have
fingerprint burning problems like mad so
I'll leave like a crime scene across the
case which is terrible so this is a much
better style in my opinion and finally
we have the pro this is a cost of down
version of the lux and it is very
aggressively priced when you come to the
inside it no longer has the basement it
no longer has the reservoir plate on the
kind of front inside area it no longer
has the PDF PWM splitter on the back of
the motherboard tray and it no longer
has one of one of the 140 millimeter
fans that come stock on the lux but like
I said it is costed down and all of
these things can be added later you
could buy the accessory for the basement
and the reservoir plate and you could
buy another fan to go put in there so if
if you need something that has an
initial lower investment it's definitely
not a bad idea on the outside in
comparison to the lucky few you lose a
few things as well the most notable and
what you'll obviously see first is that
the lighting features are not there so
on the i/o plate everything is the same
as well except for the lighting button
and then at the top you lose that extra
shroud that you had to get fit fans
there and the super super easily
removable fan filter but you can still
remove this fan filter to clean it
