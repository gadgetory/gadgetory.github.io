shuttle with a radeon HD 7970 and a 2600
cake now please note guys there is no
overclocking and no overclocking will be
done but a lot of naysayers out there
have said well Pablo minus the 500 watt
power supply in there is not capable of
running that kind of a system to which I
say pop because it can and also this is
more of a test than something that I
actually know already but I wanted to
check out what kind of temperatures were
going to get on the system if we load up
in intensive oh okay apparently CPUs
that is not working properly but
whatever there's a 2600 k in there
that's all I really needed to show you
guys and I I'm telling you it's not
overclocked you know let's run some
small FFT and CEO to boost up to its on
air cooling so it should pretty much
find its temperature pretty quickly here
that's probably going to make the GPU
run a little bit hotter as well not much
though I mean they're they're sort of
different thermal zones because the
ventilation holes here are going to be
mostly actually I can feel the air
coming and are going to be intake for
the vga fan which was right here and
then exhausting air out the back and
then the CPU intake area is going to be
over here on this other side because the
video card actually physically blocks
off the video card cooler from the rest
of the internals here okay so there we
go our load CPU temperatures are in the
neighborhood of let's say sixty degrees
okay which is still acceptable and then
let's fire up a game and let's find out
what our load video card temps are gonna
be so what we're going to do actually
hall let's do it this way we're going to
torch your test four threads so that we
are pretty much fully loading this
system let's leave let's leave real temp
on actually so that we can we can see
when we get out of the game how how hot
it's running and then we are going to
launch the campaign of battlefield 3
we're going to leave afterburner running
so that we can check the GPU types oh
yeah idle GPU temps about 40 40 plus
degrees which is still
double yes the system is a touch on the
loud side it's not what I would consider
to be a silent system but it's also not
what I would consider to be unacceptable
either it's what i say is kind of you
know your typical desktop all right give
me a sec here guys I'll get in game and
then we'll check this out so noise level
the machine here I'm just gonna get
slick to bring the camera kind of close
to it so you can see you can kind of
hear the quality of the noise it's not a
super high pitch noise which to me makes
more difference than the overall noise
quality in general oh I was about to oh
yeah I guess it's okay here you
carefully move my steam drive which is
what my games run off of just going to
open up the the shroud here and then
I'll put it back on before we take our
temperature measurements but i just want
to show you guys how jam-packed it isn't
there like yeah i get--oh mounted the
SSD whatever but got the 2600 k running
there and the 7970 is installed with not
a millimeter to spare and come over here
and check out the other side we've got
some musk in ridgeback 8gig memories in
there about the Kulin for the drm okay
so we can throw this back on I'm not
even gonna bother putting the screws on
this time just because the screws do not
affect the cooling performance of the
chassis in any way although having it
close prop for the desk there we go ok
so I'll show you guys what kind of
performance forgetting in battlefield 3
on ultra yes ultra presets damn and here
we go so yes we are getting above 30 FPS
in intensive scenarios that means
explosions going on all over the place
and I just got knifed oh man okay well
either way let's check out what kind of
low temperatures we get in what I would
consider to be as far as realistic
scenarios go a full load scenario so
here we go so our CPU maxes out around
60 degrees even with the graphics card
running full more as well and then msi
afterburner shows us that our graphics
card is peaking at around 72 degrees so
very nice so yes
you can build a high-performance system
in a shuttle PC if you have the you know
desire thank you for watching Linus tech
