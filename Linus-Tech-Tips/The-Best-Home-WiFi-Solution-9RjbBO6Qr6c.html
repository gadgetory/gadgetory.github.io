collaborative between google tp-link and
a soos to create a truly simple home
Wi-Fi router and they achieved that and
more it was simple to use and
outperformed a ruckus our 7/10 in our
testing $1,000 solution now of course we
weren't able to get like a hundred
different Wi-Fi devices on it or
anything crazy like that where a ruckus
device would shine but that's still damn
impressive
there was only one small problem if your
home was too large or had too many walls
that were difficult for Wi-Fi to
penetrate like cement you were kind of
screwed range extenders are objectively
terrible and having multiple access
points with separate SSIDs
is hardly user friendly this time
there's a new solution enter Google
Wi-Fi and one of its competitors the
Netgear or b2 different Wi-Fi solutions
that promise better coverage and
smoother access point transitions
through mesh networking let's check them
out
verdaguer zerg anomic s and plus line
gaming chairs make a great addition to
any gaming setup check them out of the
link below the idea behind these
so-called Wi-Fi systems which include a
router and one to two additional access
points is smooth uninterrupted
transitions between Wi-Fi zones you
should be able to walk around your house
seamlessly changing what access point
that you are connected to without any
hitches in your signal while everything
is handled by the Wi-Fi system in the
background no need to go into your phone
or laptop and change what point you're
connected to as you walk around it does
it all for you
this may seem familiar if you've used a
well implemented Wi-Fi system at
something like a large office or a
school but it hasn't been very
accessible for consumers until now both
the Google Wi-Fi and the Netgear or be
promised essentially the same thing I
mean they even both have the same quote
from C net on their respective websites
saying that their Wi-Fi system is the
best on the market though to be fair
reading the full quote on CNET of the or
be review reveals that they actually
said that it was the best at the time
and that it may be better to wait for
Google Wi-Fi tisk tisk Netgear
physically however both devices are
quite different the main or b package
comes with two rather large units a
router and an access point both of these
units feature quite a bit of
expandability with four Ethernet ports
and a USB port Google wi-fi's main
package on the other hand comes with
three rather small units which are all
identical featuring two Ethernet ports
which can operate in a switch mode if
preferred and then there's also a Type C
USB port but that's for power the setup
of both systems was simple and easy in
their own way Google does theirs through
an app and mostly has you just clicking
next or scanning a QR code as it handles
all of the work for you and hides most
of the complicated stuff behind the
scenes as you place the access points
around your location it will constantly
test to make sure that the signal to the
base is strong and stable Netgear on the
other hand has you connect to their
network with a default password then go
through a simple in browser setup
process with
slightly more revealed Advanced Options
than Google wi-fi's while it does
testing and stuff in the background as
well keeping the whole thing simple
overall now at a surface level this may
leave you thinking that the or B is
better set for like if you have an
access point in an office and you have a
bunch of things plugged into it more
business focused and less total Wi-Fi
range and the Google Wi-Fi is more for
just having Wi-Fi everywhere but it's
not actually that simple they're
actually quite different overall and
while Google hides most the specs for
their unit performance should reveal
what is best for you so let's try them
out whoa it's like many days later after
CES we took some extra time on this one
because we experienced a few oddities
with our testing I set up both of the
routers on Linus's desk which is just
outside of the main offices area of our
studio and don't worry I do this one at
a time so they wouldn't screw with each
other then during their respective
testing sections I set up one access
point in the furthest away reasonable
corner from Linus's desk but still
within the office area and for Google
Wi-Fi I also set up a third unit way on
the other end of the warehouse then I
tested the transfer speeds of one large
file one medium file and a ton of small
pictures going from a Mac book which has
fantastic Wi-Fi capabilities to a
desktop that was wired into the network
on that router that I set up earlier and
vice versa I do this in three locations
six feet away from the router to
simulate a small relatively cramped
office in the conference room which
wasn't very close to any access points
at all and in one of the loading bays
which was the furthest corner of the
warehouse away from all of the access
points the orby behaved sort of weird
especially when the laptop was about 6
feet away from the router to be clear
you don't want your Wi-Fi devices that
close to each other having a laptop this
close to the router is not an ideal
situation but it is a very possible
situation in cramped apartments and
Google Wi-Fi dealt with it just fine in
conclusion my testing methodology
involved a
warehouse some random files that we've
been using for file transfer tests for
years now and a rather large testing
area that was totally out of spec at
6000 square feet
neither of them say that they can handle
that at all and both of them did that's
something to give the or be considering
their mesh properties both systems did
very well but still Google Wi-Fi was a
rather clear winner in this use case but
there's one last very important thing
the creepiness level for the or B I
didn't personally finally think fishy
but I could be wrong on the Google side
of things they don't even try to hide
that they're collecting data it's up to
you to decide if you're okay with what
they're collecting or not look up Google
Wi-Fi and your privacy for more
information tunnel bear is the simple
VPN app that makes it easy to browse
privately and enjoy a more open Internet

slash LTT thanks for watching guys if
you liked this video like it if you
disliked it dislike it could subscribe
all that fun stuff check it down below
you can see to buy some mesh networking
parts if you would like them also you
can see where to purchase one of our
shirts and discuss these mesh networking
ideas on the forum if you want to check
out that google onhub video that i
referenced earlier because maybe you
have one our friend has one you think
about adding Google Wi-Fi to it for
whatever reason it could expand your
network check that it up here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
