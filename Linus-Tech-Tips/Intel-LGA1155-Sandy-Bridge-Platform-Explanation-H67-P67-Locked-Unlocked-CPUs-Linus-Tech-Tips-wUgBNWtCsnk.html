demystifying the new Intel Sandy Bridge
processors and the chipsets that go with
them a little bit or at least we're
going to be attempting to do so now
there's a few new features on these
chips are a few important features let's
say so let's start with Intel turbo so
turbo as we're familiar with already
from the core i7 original processor
allows the chip to overclock itself if
you have enough cooling and you're not
overstepping the thermal design power so
turbo processors such as the core i5
2400 are allowed to turbo themselves up
up to four speed grades above their
stock frequency if you're using only one
core they also okay so here let's let's
let's start sort of working our way
along here
so they are also allowed to turn up the
multiplier and OC up to four speed bins
above that for Speed bins so up to eight
speed bins or multiplier levels on the P
67 chipset this is also the same as over
here okay on the age 67 it can only use
turbo mode that's it no additional
overclocking so for speed bins turbo
there so that is a regular turbo
processor then there are completely non
turbo processors in terms of
overclocking we have no support on age
67 no support on P 67 and no support on
z68 nothing you can overclock probably
about 5% if you turn up the base clock
but it's really not recommended because
you can do all kinds of nasty stuff like
corrupt your hard drive and just don't
do it ok so then we've got unlock so an
example would be like a low end core i3
alright unlocked so these ones have
turbo because all the unlocked chips are
already reasonably high-end chips and
they also have a suffix K so the example
we're using is the core i7 2600
so you cannot increase Wow okay I guess
you got support for the
four-speed regular turbo okay you have
completely up to whatever the heck you
want in terms of overclocking on p67
and you have up to whatever you want on
z68 which isn't out yet so these guys
you can overclock as much as you could
possibly want mom tell the chip reaches
its limit so ok right so if z68 is
exactly the same as p 67 then what's
going on here so let's talk about the
other important feature of these new
core iSeries processors and that is
their onboard graphics so there are a
few different kinds of onboard graphics
built into these chips the K series
chips actually have the highest end
onboard graphics which is pretty funny
because I know onboard graphics on P 67
so on the platform where you can
actually overclock these K series chips
you have no support for onboard video
here we have onboard video enabled but
we actually can't overclock the chips so
you have the best possible graphics
court on the one that is only supported
on the one where you can't overclock it
and it has the overclock so here we have
onboard graphics enabled that is the
difference between Z 68 and P 67 it has
sort of the best of both worlds but it
isn't out yet so these ones don't have
quite as powerful and onboard graphics
card so same thing here
no onboard graphics supported here it's
supported here it's supported and same
thing here these ones have the lowest
end onboard graphics and here is no and
here is okay so that is the difference
between all these different chips and
all these different chipsets so in
summary if you are not using onboard
graphics and you are overclocking then
your choice is going to be a K series
processor and a p67 motherboard if you
want to use onboard graphics and you
don't really care quite as much about
performance you do not need a K series
processor you can get either one of
these and an H 67
they're bored if you want the best of
both world I guess you'll just have to
wait until z68 launches at some point in
the future don't forget to subscribe to
