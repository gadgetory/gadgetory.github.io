comes packed with this little guy right
here and I mean little whether it's been
by removing thin area or eliminating
performance enhancing copper slugs intel
has been costing down their box cooler
for years years I mean to be clear it is
adequate for default operation but it
would easily be overwhelmed by an
overclocked processor but what is Intel
made a stock heatsink specifically for K
series and x-series overclockable chips
well it turns out they do and it looks
pretty much like what you'd expect if
Intel's cooling engineers the same ones
what bring you this were terminally
unimaginative and we're told well make
something like that but that performs a
bit better so it looks about like the
stock cooler on roids but did the
treatment give it better performance or
just mood swings fatigue and a deflated
sex drive let's find out
the be quiet dark BassPro 900s modular
design supports a variety of different
layouts and configurations click on the
link in the video description to learn
more okay silly intro aside taking the
Intel thermal solution gs-15 a out of
the box it looks pretty much like
somebody took three or so regular Intel
stock heat sinks and glued them together
the push mounting pins remain for that
easy installation and the fan clips on
to the top exactly the same way it
normally would looking more closely at
it though reveal some differences so the
regular heatsink uses an aluminum
extrusion process to create the required
profile that's great for keeping costs
down but not so great for having thin
higher performance fins so for the gs-15
a which will be calling roy d from now
on each pin here is actually its own
bank piece of metal that meets at the
center so you can kind of see it here
around a copper slug this increases
performance but also increases
manufacturing cost but how much
additional performance does it actually
get you and can you slap a decent
overclock on your processor using it and
then perhaps more importantly at this
price does it make any sense to actually
go and buy this product compared to
larger and probably better coolers like
the cooler master hyper 212 evo they are
available for as little as only two
dollars more to test this we first ran a
couple of other heat sinks on an Intel
Core i7 7700 K at both the stock speed
of 4.5 gigahertz turbo and a modest 4.8
gigahertz overclock that was mostly
there to increase its Hido
the stocks and curve was used for these
tests and we also used the thermal
compound that comes pre applied to these
things out of the box and yeah it
couldn't quite do it add the stock speed
the roided cooler was able to pull off a
warm 81 degrees Celsius but with our
step fairly reasonable overclock it
throttled hard reaching a hundred
degrees Celsius in about 30 seconds the
only thing in our test table here that
performed worse than the ROI cooler was
actually the regular Intel stock cooler
which immediately throttled so badly
that we just cancelled the test out of
pity for both our board and our chip you
know what it's not all terrible news
though I mean it was able to maintain
4.7 gigahertz in the point 1 volt offset
test which wasn't really fair because
that makes this chip more like a space
heater than a room heater get it cuz
like outer space anyway and with a bit
of tweaking we were actually able to get
this processor up to a stable 4.9
gigahertz without it thermal throttling
that is to say upstairs where the
temperatures are about 5 degrees cooler
here it is definitely thermal throttling
but it's still managing about 4.8
gigahertz sustained at 100 degrees ok
then so it performs a bit worse than a
hyper 212 Evo dome product video over
right
wrong if I'm investing 33 of my
hard-earned dollars plus shipping
we're going to dig deep what about a
comparison to AMD's cooler that's sort
of a stocks cooler but you also have to
buy it separately now the easiest way to
see how these stack up would be to use
the same heat load of the same CPU but
unfortunately that isn't possible given
that there aren't currently any am4 to
LGA 1151 mounting adapters or vice-versa
so we devised a completely over
engineered and clever plan to use an
intermediary reference cooler that was
compatible with both or because we're
thorough like that we actually used a
total of three references and looking at
the results AMD is the winner for non
stock stock cooler performance although
only by a slim 5% over royalty and at 12
percent more expensive it looks like
it's pretty much coming down to whether
it's worth it to you to pay seven
percent for that RGB lighting although
there is one other thing that really
differentiates them as well the noise
level once the intel fan kicks in it
reaches about 40 decibels which isn't
overly loud but the AMD Wraith cooler
comes in at 38 decibels so you think
okay that's pretty similar uh ah the AMD
cooler is at a low frequency so tuning
it out is easy kind of like a clothes
dryer in the other room the intel cooler
on the other hand is high-pitched and
very distracting kind of like your boss
which hey anyway at this point you might
assume that we aren't big fans of paying
aftermarket dollars for OEM design and
that we think buying the intel thermal
solution ts 50
I would be super dumb and that would be
correct
great work detective this is Omar's
cherrywood earbuds they are as I
mentioned handcrafted from natural
cherry wood with handmade details and
they've got all the normal features
you'd expect from headphones as well
including a built-in microphone with one
button function control coaxial dual
driver speakers a 45-degree oblique
angle design and it comes prepackaged
with three pairs of ultra soft silicon
ear pads and small medium and large
sizes these things are 50 bucks on
Amazon and US residents can use code Oh
earbuds to save 40% which would make
them $30 and these are absolutely
ignoring the wood handcrafted miss these
things sound killer for 30 bucks like
unbelievable so go check them out at the

consider checking out where to buy the
other stuff we featured like the hyper
212 Evo or really any cooler from Noctua
at the link in the video description
also down there is a link to our merch
store where you can get cool shirts like
this one as well as our community forum
which you should totally join I've got
to go have a word with our writer Alex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
