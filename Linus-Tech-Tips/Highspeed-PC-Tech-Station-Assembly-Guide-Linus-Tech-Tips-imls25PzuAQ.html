well rather assembly guide for the
high-speed PC XL ATX top deck tech
station that I have for my personal use
now or well rather my tech tips use so
i'm going to show you guys step by step
what to do first thing is you will need
a Phillips head screwdriver they
recommend a powered one but I don't have
one so i'll be using this one next you
should compare all the parts included
with the reference in the instruction
manual here to make sure that everything
is included if it's not there email
supported high-speed pc com alright
finally you can get started you should
cleared us give yourself room and yeah
that's pretty much it okay so step one
assemble the test bench feet for this
step you will use the four rubber feet
for stainless washers and 41 inch screws
that look like this you'll position the
feet over the mount over the guide holes
right here position the screw and then
you will screw them in until they just
barely poke through you're going to
tighten it the rest of the way later on
when you attach the upright post I'll
show you guys how deep I'm going to go
so just about like that so where you
have a little bit exposed the next step
is pretty straightforward we're going to
install the motherboard rubber standoff
guys okay so basically you're going to
screw these down tight enough that the
rubber doesn't rotate anymore but not so
tight that the rubber starts to pucker
because if you drive down tight enough
you can put the screw right through the
rubber and you may ruin the rubber
standoff now for a couple of the holes
so invariably this one up here which is
going to be the top of where your
motherboard is mounted and all the way
through there we go
and then sometimes this one sometimes
this one and sometimes this one you're
going to put these two nylon screws and
then you're going to hand thread down a
rubber standoff and this is to hold the
board in place because the threads on
these guys here hopefully and get to see
the threads on here will keep the board
from slipping off okay so just hand
tight on there so you put it here for
matx here for ATX in here for XL and HP
TX so i'm going to show you guys quickly
this is what it looks like if you over
tighten it see how it starts to flare
out at the bottom so I'm just gonna
untighten that one and put it back right
where it's supposed to be there can't
turn the rubber can shot okay and
finally see these little nuts right here
I never ever use them but in theory
after you put a motherboard on you can
screw this on to hold the mother board
in place more permanently next step is
to install the fan bracket so we're
going to use these little guys and we
are going to do fan one first please
focus please focus there we go so you
just flip this guy over put it like that
and then drive the screw into the this
is going to be the bottom of the top
deck so you can see the nylon washers
poking through here so that is where the
back of the motherboard will be on the
other side of this piece and just like
that these ones i do pretty tight just
because i'm often doing weird stuff like
hanging radiators off them and whatnot
don't do them super super tight right
now because you're going to want to have
a little bit of give when you're
installing your fans and then you can
crank it a little bit later then you
just repeat that process for fans two
and three respectively for this next
step the hard drive stopper you will
need the spacer the stopper right there
it goes right there so just show you
guys have the fans on now already and
you will need the slightly longer screw
that looks like this put that in there
and then screwed in the next step is
installing the hard drive rails so my
their tech stations don't come with the
option for two and a half inch but new
ones do so regardless you put in this
one so you can see you use a nylon
spacer right here you use a screw and
then you use the plastic rail which is
going to hold on to the drives like this
see like so so you'll either put your
tuna half-inch drive in there or you'll
put your three and a half inch drive in
there okay hopefully you guys can see
that now it is imperative that you don't
over tighten this screw right here like
you see this doesn't move much remember
it's not holding up the world it's just
holding up a couple of drives so you
make sure it's not moving around but i
can still spin the washer in here are
the nylon spacer in here freely so don't
like crank it tight i'm going to do mine
for three and a half inch because SSDs
are not much of a problem to just stuff
between your optical drive in your power
supply not to mention that if you drop
an SSD while you're moving your tax
station it's not a big deal and if you
drop a hard drive it's pretty much dead
this next step seems a little tricky but
actually it's quite easy you take this
piece right here which is a threaded
bolt you push it through so remember
this is where the back of the
motherboard is where these nylon posts
come through so you're putting it
through this very corner one here and
the very corner one here then what you
do is you take your shorter of your two
types of posts you put the hole at the
top because remember that's where the
expansion cards are going to eventually
plug into and you thread this one on
from the top and you take a longer one
and you thread it on from the bottom
turning at the same time so you can see
here's one that I've partially completed
I'm just going to adjust my chest cam
here so I can show you guys what I'm
doing and I am twisting them both at the
same time now high-speed PC mentions
that it's a little bit tricky to ensure
that this whole stays facing outward and
that's very important so you want to
tighten this one in all the way then
hold it outward and tighten in the
bottom one the rest of the way to make
sure that it faces the right way because
you want a nice snug fit between these
otherwise your tech station is going to
be loose when you pick it up for this
next step all you need is the remaining
to support post and what we're going to
be doing is we're going to be taking
those screws that we threaded ever so
slightly through the bottom platform
and we are going to be screwing them
into the support posts so it's quite
important while you're doing this to
hold the post very snugly against the
tech station please focus mr. camera oh
come on all right so here what I was
what i did was i held it between my legs
focus focus thank you okay held it
between my legs like this and I use a
screwdriver from one side holding it
snugly and just screw that in like that
you go until the foot compresses a
little bit and then once that happens
you want to do about a half turn so I
think we're pretty much there holding
the screw in place do about a half turn
or even a quarter turn with the support
stand itself to make sure that you've
got a nice snug fit against the base
it's starting to look pretty complete I
have taken my bottom portion and I've
put it down on top of the top portion
just like this I'm lining up these
screws that are poking through a little
bit with the holes right there and then
I'm going to tighten them down in much
the same manner being careful not to
over-tighten through the feet so that
the washer pops out you see the washer
that's that's in there all right until I
have a nice snug fit and then it's
pretty much put together and all we're
really left with is a couple finishing
touches now I flip around the tech
station one more time I put together
this assembly where I have the final
silver screws we don't really have any
silver screws left a washer and a little
cap to go over it and I'm threading
those in well screwing those in to the
final part of the two platforms that
needs to be supported so I'm just going
to go till I can see it sticking through
a little bit line that up with the hole
now you can see what I'm doing here okay
and then I'm going to hold it snug and
screw those in and it's pretty much
structurally complete at that point so
I'm just going to put some pressure here
I'll do this on camera
if I want to show you guys one of these
finishing touch steps that so that's
nice and snug then I just close up that
little cap keeps that metal screw from
being exposed in shorting anything out
alright so now we're going to put that
PCI support bracket on at the back
person here so you can see here's where
where the IO of the motherboard is so
this is where the expansion cards go
please note that these holes are going
to be closer to the motherboard rather
than further away from it or the
brackets on your PCI cards will not line
up you're going to use two different
screws for this one you're going to use
a sharp one that goes into this post and
then you're going to use a blunted one
come on let's see focus focus whatever
you're going to use a blunted one that
goes up into this nylon piece here so
you're just going to use an L bracket
position it right there and then screw
them in completely so that it's nice and
tight like I've done on this side here
oh and last but not least for this piece
gonna put a little cap on there so it
looks nice and finished you know they're
so I'm melting my fans I'm putting my
neoprene non-slip pad into the bottom of
the tech station here so that's where
i'll put my power supply all that good
stuff so it doesn't move around once I
put it down I'm also screwing in the
fans so fans go in just like this now I
person they provide a suggestion for how
to mount the fans I believe fan mounting
is very personal so you know maybe I
want to take hot air away from the cpu
area maybe I have at our heat sink here
blowing air that way and then maybe my
graphics cards are installed in the
lower slot so maybe I want to push cool
their towards them whatever the case may
be you can install the fans however suit
your personal needs the rest of the
stuff i consider optional so these guys
i mentioned before are for securing the
motherboard down which i consider highly
optional i'll just throw these away also
we have plastic thumb screws which there
is no way i'll use i have my own thumb
screws that i prefer that are a little
bit easier to work with because the i
don't know they just cooperate with the
threads better see these ones i have a
little bit of trouble with them
really like those and then obviously
we've got fans crews this is another
thing that I probably won't do but if
you have curious pets or children then
it's definitely a good idea to install
these fan gardens just like that ok so
just screw those in from the other side
just two screws is good enough to secure
a fan garden place and have it not
vibrate so I would just do it like that
remember the whole point of this is
efficiency and quick hardware testing so
there it is that is my assembly guide
for the high speed pc top deck tech
station i hope you've enjoyed it don't
