the all-new geforce gtx 660 from nvidia
now this is actually pretty different
from the 660ti in fact they are even
using different GPU cores so let's get
into what special about MSI's Twin Frozr
version of this card this is an O state
card it has two gigs of memory just like
a gtx 660ti it is PCI Express 3.0 ready
so this is using a Kepler GPU with all
of the latest features from Nvidia full
support for DirectX 11 and a three year
warranty in US Canada in Mexico only
moving right along we've got whatever
well what else does MSI have to say for
themselves MSI Afterburner is a
fantastic utility you should use it
whether you have an msi card or not it's
a great overclocking utility they're
using solid caps although I don't see a
military clasp any military clasp
branding on here so they've at least got
the solid caps going from their military
class concept they long they're also
using their new propeller blade fans so
these do generate more airflow than
their well their previous generation
fans and multiple heat pipes direct
contact design high-density heatsink so
they're talking a lot about the Twin
Frozr cooler which we will again look at
more closely once we open it up so let's
just you know what let's dive right into
it here because you guys want to see the
card itself you don't want to hear me
talking about it so Kepler what is
Kepler all about Kepler is all about way
better performance than Fermi with less
power consumption than Fermi and well
yeah I mean do you need do you need you
need more than that so the last the last
generation cores were all based on the
Fermi architecture and now we have
Kepler available for the masses so
Kepler started with the GTX 680 which
brought all kinds of cool new features
with its introduction including their
adaptive vsync which turns vsync on when
you need it and off what it's not going
to be helping you but rather hindering
you as well as new anti-aliasing modes
phenomenal power consumption I can't
stress that enough compared to previous
generation cards you're going to need a
less powerful power supply which means
instead of spending money on
you can spend money on better efficiency
which is actually gonna save you money
on your power bill I mean not a ton
especially if you live here in Canada
where power is relatively cheap but if
you're somewhere in Europe for example
or in some parts of the US it can
actually make a difference if you can
have you know a slightly better gaming
experience or a significantly better
gaming experience and save a few bucks a
month on your power as well and like hey
why not write in terms of accessory we
have a quick users guide oh yeah see
this download the latest version yeah do
that we've also got a quick installation
guide again DVI to VGA adapter and a
dual molex to 6-pin PCI II connector so
here we go let's get into the card
itself there are the propeller blades
there's your twin frozer you've got
three geet pipes so two smaller heat
pipes and then one big fat super pipe
coming out directly over the GPU core
you can tell where the GPU core is
because you can see it on the back and
taking the heat as far away from the GPU
itself as possible so almost the entire
card is covered in aluminum fins here
I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys a
pretty good view of it there and then
again almost the entire cart up to the
end of the PCB here and up to almost the
end of the PCB here is covered by these
fins so while this card doesn't have a
full yuna sink as we've seen on some
previous msi cards where here I'll try
to give you guys a view that where all
the memory chips are sometimes covered
by by a heatsink by a heat spreader it
does have their rigidity enhancing
pieces I don't know what they're calling
this but the point is what it does is it
keeps the weight of the card from
weighing down on your slot and keeps the
card from flexing and and torquing like
this against the PCI Express slot so
this little aluminum piece right here
doesn't really contribute anything in
the way of cooling but it does make your
card more stable in the slot which can
help especially if you're buying a
system you might want to choose one of
these so that it doesn't have a chance
of of breaking or destroying anything in
the process of shipping in terms of
outputs we have got more Kepler features
so dual DVI hdmi and displayport powers
up to 3 plus 1/3 plus 1/3 plus 1
displays in surround gaming with a
single auxilary display however I would
suggest that if you're gonna run triple
displays especially at 1080p you
probably want to step up to its big
brother the 660ti which uses using a GK
104 core whereas this guy right here is
using a GK 106 core both the 660 and the
660ti are using 192 bit memory
interfaces which will not affect your
performance that much particularly on
the 660ti compared to the 670 until you
get into really high resolution gaming
or very large textures where it's really
needing that fast data transfer on and
off of the frame buffer which you will
get with the 670 or a 680 and I'll let
you guys kinda have a look here because
you're going to see a fairly strange
arrangement to the memory so there's
only four memory chips on the back and
what that here compared to how many are
on the front it should be suddenly four
on the front to open sorry so what
NVIDIA is doing in order to achieve a
two gig frame buffer with only 192 bit
memory bus okay is there doing some
voodoo magic that allows them to
actually mix and match the density of
the memory modules of the memory chips
that they're using on the card so that
they can get an even number so a 1 gig a
2 gig or even I guess potentially a four
gig frame buffer if they come up with
higher density chips for them with a non
even memory bus width so normally it'd
be 128 or 256 in order to get an even
memory amount but they are gone they've
gone with a 192 bit bus and an even
memory amount all the usual and video
technologies are supported so you've got
full support for SLI although only
two-way SLI there's only one SLI
connector on the top of the cart
you've also got support for 3d vision as
well as nvidia cuda physx is also
supported so all those new anti-aliasing
technologies TxAA fxaa
and oh right power requirements so i've
talked a lot about how it's a low power
requirement card only a single 6 pin PCI
II connector is required for this card
and the performance does get pretty
close to its bigger
the 660ti so what does it come down to
this is a great option if you're gaming
at 1080p although I'd say above 1080p if
you want to run on high details it
starts to become a less compelling
option you might want to step up to a
660ti and thank you for checking out our
