this year we would not be at Computex
2015 without them and also thank you to
Linda calm all right guys welcome to the
in win booth where we were checking out
the H frame this is a case that I
actually saw earlier at a soos I think
on day 1 or 2 and I thought a modder
head building they had a bunch of modern
cases in the area but it's actually a
case that's going into production this
is a continuation of their concept
series of cases they this is the sixth
one in the line and they release about
one every year this is the only case
that I know of that actually requires
dedicated power to work which is fairly
insane but that's because it's a
freaking transformer this thing opens up
a Tim okay maybe transformer isn't the
best wording because it looks like
something from Avengers that could hold
like the tesseract or something yeah
that's what Brandon said and I
completely agree it opens up to like
reveal the motherboard so it's easy to
work on but realistically it's just
because it's freaking cool there's four
little laser spotlights one on each side
of the computer that can show you where
the perimeter needs to be clear around
the computer for it to open up and did
not actually hit any obstructions in the
area and along with those laser
projected lights there's LED strips that
go up the forearms of the case and can
be controlled by the app which can also
control how the case opens up and
performs in other ways if silver and RGB
is in your theme they also have the ROG
certified Edition which comes in black
and red and then those LED strips can
only go to either red or white if that's
more of your color palette taste on the
left-hand side you have power for the
power supply which the routing for that
is going to change that ideas not final
so it'll probably be more elegant on the
actual release version you have power
for the case itself and you have
switches to turn on those lasergrid
lights around the case or the LED strips
within the case on the right hand side
you have the controls for the mechanics
of the case itself so you can open it up
step-by-step close it step-by-step or
set it to automatic which will fully
closed or fully open it depending on how
open or close it currently is right
above those controls is the IO where you
have three USB 3.0 plugs one USB 3.1
type C plug two audio jacks a reset
button with a blue hard drive led LED in
the middle of it and a power switch
which also has a blue LED ring around it
there's not much going on on
the case other than a big red warning
stop button which is basically just in
case you're worried about the case
hitting something while it's opening up
you can slam that stop button then it
will stop what it's doing once we move
inside you'll see compatibility for
motherboards that sizes ei TX and below
you'll see that you can have up to 209
or 240 millimeters CPU coolers depending
on the position of that CPU cooler up to
340 millimeter length graphics cards at
200 millimetres of height and a power
supply of 230 millimeters in length at
ATX form factor you can fit 8 add-in
cards for two and a half inch SSDs with
two of them being below the reservoir
and two of them being on the back of the
motherboard tray and one two three and a
half inch drive slot which is also on
the back of the motherboard tray also on
the back of that motherboard tray is a
unique serial number as they will only
probably be selling about 200 or 250 of
these cases and by the way they'll be
around at probably 1,500 bucks although
neither of those numbers are finalized
at this moment the vast majority of the
case is made out of very thick aluminum
two millimeters in some places three
millimeters in other places
pretty crazy although the supporting
mechanical arm that raises up the main
section of the case is made out of steel
and last but not least is cooling as
you'll see on here there's pumps and
reservoirs and whatnot mounted but most
of those were custom drilled spots the
only actual dedicated spot for cooling
is up near the top where you can either
fit just three normal fans or a radiator
and three additional fans let me know
what you guys think about the H frame in
the comments down below or on twitter at
Luke underscore la fr it might not be
the most practical due to the cost but
it would be pretty damn cool the like
swap out a graphics card now and then to
have your computer actually give itself
to you when you need to do that anyways
let me know like I said while you're
down there like dislike favorite share
subscribe all that fun stuff thank you
to MSI for sending us to you this year
we would not be at combi decks 2015
without them if you wanted to check out
their bitly lake in the description down
below this video you can check out all
the products that they launched at
Computex this year including their
laptops which are running Broadwell
processors also thank you to lynda.com
slash coffee Dex and you can get a 10
day free trial there and start learning
immediately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
