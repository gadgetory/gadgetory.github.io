2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is Corsair
Vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCI XCOM okay so okay come on help me
out with this okay so 13th unlocking
okay 13 is missing and then four is
unlucky for is me 14 body half 14 then
you know it's kind of ridiculous it's
like the place my parents live they have
no 13th floor no floors with four in
them but then it goes up to 40 floors so
they have 40 41 42 psyche you don't just
get to make up new rules so our room
here at the Sherwood is awesome check
this out there's like a place to sit
that okay know the place to sit makes no
sense but it's like I don't know you
could if you have like a really small
person then you'd have like in it maybe
it's like a dog bed well you're like a
romantic thing I'm antegrade like have a
couple sit well the beds over there they
brought what the romance and we've got
our closet so that's where the safe is
including a romantic housecoat please
don't open the veins bitch got it okay
toilets aren't for toilets huge the
bathroom is huge so this is this is sort
of different because oh another romantic
house good so oh whoa okay so you could
have two people showering in this
bathroom at the same time but one of
them would be expected to kind of do
this and then the other one would be
expected to go in the actual stand-up
shower so it has both a bath and a
shower and an additional shower for the
bath but only one sink mind you so you
wouldn't get sort of too many too many
sort of people in here at the same time
although one person could be on the
heated can so there's power save
functionality seat heat and seat sensor
and then there's a control panel on the
left
Oh control panel yeah there we go okay
so what happens you press the thing
and get me on it yeah be on it for it to
work yeah it has sensors it has sensors
well but if you like what you
I guess it's probably pretty powerful I
don't want you using it as like a
drinking fountain yeah because it can
squirt over the seat oh okay here we go
so next we've got to clean beds which is
much better than our arrangement at CES
where we had to have four people sharing
to clean beds now we have two people
sharing to clean beds which is awesome
I'm sharing a room with b-roll got a TV
but our little cabinet here with
presumably ludicrous of expense and I
yes Pringles I'm almost afraid to touch
them just because probably poison um and
then old enough poison but don't be
expensive and Oh our breakfast menu
which is brilliant because our breakfast
is covered for us every day except the
days of the Computex show so we're like
well we're here for Computex they're
like oh well then you get breakfast on
this one day here's our desk here is our
window here is B rolls chair yes my
chair woo this is actually a super super
comfy chair and that's pretty much it
that's our room it's actually super
super nice so those buttheads left the
hotel without us because we're running
behind them and
they didn't give us the note in the
hotel so we have no idea where they are
now
taijuan cellular corp but like I don't
know we're in the spot now
great so a loss so apparently this store
is closed but forever thank you
like forever III don't know he was just
like out there gone
so okay how can a hotel not have that
updated already I don't know and
parently that's where they said it's
like a diesel so then they must be just
wondering you have got to be kidding me
this is a great start have I told you
how great will start this is
so here we are in Taipei it's uh yep and
everything is closed
we're trying to buy some cards well it's
gone out we don't really know how things
work here it's like really confusing oh
okay and yeah apparently he went the
other way we should do the samething
lady not we got to similan and why
because I think it's the only sword it's
gonna be open and it's really really
humid so we won't drink
yeah rule number one stay hydrated
ah you got something like egg things
going on here and looks like you kind of
make your own sort of delicious things
and we got some like hot dogs this is
this is really that different seafood
wrap so our seaweed wraps in cellar
doors yeah yeah all look good 7-eleven
this is new
well we got another note at him we are
in our room we assumed you would stay
here long so we've been on I've got
these chase how long were we walked like
away from 7-eleven where's there where's
their room 14 911 oh hi did you guys
find SIM cards no we could do it did you
like how the the directions were to a
place that the guy told us is like gone
what yeah so so we went down there then
we're like oh well they're from North
America maybe they gravitated towards
the 7-eleven after someone who's
actually less adventurous than me can
you walk me through the foreign
delicacies that you have on your plate
here I have a what they call backing
over here back in yakking and welcome
fun yeah these socks
so T so T attentions patatas okay
haggis Wow cool
these look can you explain to me why you
did this well I thought I would clean up
this mess because the guy who did it
- sorry did you say slick nice and -
it's like why would you put sausages in
miso soup now that I think this video
record will prove that it was you okay
so we're heading for the second tallest
building in the world I got Jason from
WD who is of course taking pictures with
someone else's cell phone other than
mine
hello thanks man give me point to get
the building oh just it's playing video
right now cool so yeah we're gonna head
up there which will be pretty exciting
the highest I've ever been is Hotel in
Vegas which was not the Sun cool I guess
if I say the highest I've ever been is
at a hotel in Vegas that could be
interpreted a little the wrong way but
Oh Taipei 101 it's like the only
building taller than you uh how do we
get there
I'm assuming you up yeah we have to talk
about this okay up as opposed to down
it's like how are your ears doing in the
world's fastest elevator directions I
can see the thing tracking I'm quickly
reminded 1,000 liters per minute that is
quite big ass Wow my ears popped like
multiple times on the way up here oh
it's probably fine
there is bigger this was pretty cool I
guess McGill holy crap it's cool because
how the building is built it comes out
on an angle so when you look over it
feels like you're actually leaning over
the edge because it comes in that is
very disorienting I mean that right
there must be like what a 30-story
building and it this is just makes it
look stupid you can see everywhere sorry
can you tell me can you tell me how
normal this is this vibration we're
feeling right now
okay so so the staff here on Taipei 101
is very reassuring everyone seems to be
kind of heading for the elevator over
there
Wow okay we can go there's like people
running around with like messages and
stuff it's funny cuz we were just in
there talking about how to damper made
it so we couldn't feel anything changing
original experiment - please be patient
and wait for our next instruction we
thank you for understanding
WD wants to go down I think we're going
down so we're going down 89 flights of
stairs no no we're not going down any
stairs yeah you know what's crazy is
that's my first time we've had but with
four or five birthplace and then Hoover
in my life that's the first time I've
ever actually felt that way yeah I have
always slept through them or something
imagine our biggest building Taipei that
is an awesome oh we're down on the lower
level of BI damper observatory oh I wish
we've been looking at the damper when
our timing was almost perfect
yeah yeah he'll be after the aftershock
is coming for sure right yes so that
should be good I'm just gonna hide
behind this dude it's funny because if
you get him from the right angle he
looks really unhappy yeah 6x is oh it's
like oh yeah we're not allowed to move
the fastest elevator in the world is
broken is it broken or they're not
letting us walk down either
we're basically stalking to say this
tell me how you feel about traveling all
the way around the world I'm totally
emailing your mom and telling her there
was an earthquake that is uh yeah slurps
licks mom is already super mad at me for
letting him go halfway around the world
so uh the fact that we were 101 stories
up during an earthquake is gonna really
throw her you know she follows me on
Twitter I think we don't have to know
it's gonna kill she's weekly mean about
me that's true
so here that's just the same fine good
vibe right now so that was a 6.5
earthquake and this is the line to go
down so I have her I think we're a bit
early we should buy some jewelry so the
entire team is getting a haircut so that
we look nice and
slick for tomorrow we have no idea
what's going on but Albert from WV here
is
guiding us through the process and the
role he's Albert is his new favorite
person as they've been talking shop
about cameras and lenses and stuff I
barely even understood the whole time
they were talking so chairs and
a refreshing beverage
so it's a paper cup but it comes in a
nice little plastic holder of the
witness
I hope it's not for
making sure the temperatures just right
not to picking lettuce how you want it
ah hole headed which shape no not not
shape just shorter just it on uh you
know what whatever whatever they think
it should about the Joe the G probably
by tieguanyin good plan but I need them
to show me how to have you know about it
style it properly after this is a diesel
get abused eyebrow shape over up over at
the shoulder yeah let me get out of the
way
I have you know how to censor stuff
sorry
yep yeah there's nothing you can do
right now because there's a straightedge
like I did to his face and I was
touching it
oh she's gonna do it yeah chance yeah
yeah I I've never felt this we had John
there ever was</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
