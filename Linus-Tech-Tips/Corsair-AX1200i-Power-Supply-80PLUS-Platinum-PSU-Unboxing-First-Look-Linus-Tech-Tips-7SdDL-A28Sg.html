the Corsair ax 1200 I so this is an
improvement over the original ax 800 and
there's the ax 800 because what I really
meant to say was ax 1200 and there's a
few things that they've done differently
so first let's go over the box itself
digital ATX power supply so meaning
they're using digitally controlled power
for tighter regulation quiet efficient
operation and there's more to this than
actually meets the eye fully modular
just like the original ax 1200 supports
corsair link yes quiet efficient
operation so using corsair link you can
actually not only monitor the efficiency
of the power supply you can also control
things like fan profiles which is not
yet been seen in public ever i mean i
think i've seen power supplies that have
a dial on the back where you can sort of
adjust the fan profile but this is more
robust they've also added a d+ platinum
certification as opposed to the 80 plus
gold certification of the original 1200
here's modular cables that we're
actually going to have a look at once we
open it up so we're not going to worry
too much about that okay digitally
controlled power for solid voltage
regulation outstanding performance
upgraded internal components and digital
design for 80-plus platinum
configuration this is a great picture
fully modular cables for quick knees
installation okay so this is more of the
same in terms of what they have to say
for themselves so let's have a look at
the back 80-plus platinum basically
means 90 plus because unless you're at
sea even at a hundred percent load
you're just under that 90 percent mark
even on 115 volt input and if you're
using 230 volt if you're in Europe or
Asia or wherever else you'll actually
basically unless you're at light you
know five percent system load you're
never going to fall below 90 you know 91
92 percent efficiency which is
outstanding the fan doesn't even turn on
until you reach 30 percent and I'm
assuming this is just the stock profile
because if you're using Corsair link you
will be able to know how well your ax
1200 is working at any given moment it
lets you quickly tweak its performance
so server inspired diagnostic tools
monitor real time efficiency power usage
configurable over current protection
Florence and fan profiles so overcurrent
protection has been a bit of a hot topic
because there's this constant
back-and-forth debate do you want a
multi rail power supply with over
current protection applied in a way that
would you know prevent potential
problems do you want a single rail power
supply that can basically have the
flexibility to power whatever components
you plug into it no matter where you
plug them in and Corsair is basically
giving you the flexibility to go okay
look we're giving you a single rail and
we're giving you the ability to actually
control how the safety features are
going to work to according to whatever
you're comfortable with you don't see
this very often though it's capable of
providing 1,200 and four point eight
watts on the 12 volt rail and total
power exactly equal end more than spec
in the past I've seen power supplies
that go for that extra five watts in the
actual product name so there you go
they've apparently not worried too much
about that 140 millimeter cooling fan
rounds up the list of features so now
let's have a look at what's in the box
oh well courser is so good at compared
to basically everyone else is products
that work well together and look great
together if you go with that we actually
did a PC at NCI x4 where I work we did a
PC not that long ago that was all
Corsair and isus premium branded parts
and the end result was outstanding
because all the parts work really well
together and look really good together
and the PC looked a lot more expensive
than it actually was just due to the
part selection that we use so that's
just a cool thing to be aware and this
look at that
there's your course our link connector
so you plug in by USB and then you've
got our third link adapter right there
cool beans power cable nice thick one
okay
download the latest link dashboard
software please visit their cool
modular cables look at those after zip
ties as well as of course a case badge
some screws excellent
users manual not gonna worry too much
about that now let's have a look at the
power supply it's also comes in a nice
velvety baggy and seat again things
Corsair understands excellent quality
foam you could pretty much you know what
be kind of funny to do this but Tom you
could pretty much drop that off a couple
story building and I'm sure your power
supply would survive to I mean don't do
this you know please don't you know
about a new corsair ii x 1200 i today
lightest and i'm going to throw it off
my you know apartment complex because
you said it would probably live like no
justno so don't do it but i suspect it
would be fine
because it's an extremely robust packing
material they're using and that's
important because when you order your
new system the last thing you want to do
is get everything all unpacked and
assembled and turn it on and it doesn't
work and packaging plays a big role in
that so there's our 140 ml fan they've
actually gone with quite a different
aesthetic compared to the ax non-ai
series so they've got a bit of a glossy
shininess to the sticker now as well as
a bit of texture and you know character
to the overall shape of the of the metal
so they've gone with a bit of a
different fan grill is still about the
circular bars in there so you can
accidentally get anything in there 140
mm fan still got yeah neat looking thing
here got your typical honeycomb grille
on the back with an on/off switch as
well as your power in and then we find
the modular interface so here we go oh
cool okay so let's go let's do cables
first I suppose so you got your 24 pin
cable this pretty much stands to reason
coarser again they're so good at this
all black cables beautiful actually give
me a sec guys now these are the best
quality included cables and I think I've
yet encountered so there's a few things
about them that are kind of special so
one we're used to that is the black
black wires so that's fantastic number
two is this is
the best sleeving that I've ever seen
included on a stalk on a stalk sleeved
power supply also the wires themselves
are very very flexible very bendy and
just have that you know that while that
quality feel about them it's not going
to impact performance in all likelihood
but they look good they feel good and
like I said this is just like there's no
gaps very dense sleeving compared to
what you see on lesser lesser power
supply products so included cable so
you've got two nice long four plus four
pin connector so you can support up to
dual eight pin motherboard without any
difficulty whatsoever you've also got
the flexibility of up to eight
selectable either six plus two s or four
plus four so it comes with 2 4 plus
floors and 6 6 plus 2 so that is PCI
Express connector so you could do up to
look like an uber motherboard with 3
dual cable graphics cards without any
difficulty whatsoever however if you
only needed let's say for example you
only needed one 8 pin but there's an
auxilary sic spend on your motherboard
and you can source another cable you can
actually use it for that so you can use
them for whichever purpose you require
you've got other included cables as well
so you've got 4 by SATA cables galore 4
of those and then you've got a bunch of
wool X connectors as well so 3 3 molex 4
pins so you're only going to be able to
plug in six of these but I think that
should still be plenty I mean that gives
you up to 12 drives I say 12 because
what I meant to say was 16 and then plus
another you know 4 by plus another
formal X's and then another 4 so another
8 molex connectors if you can't power
everything in your system at that point
then you're probably doing something
wrong on the back you also find a couple
more things so one is a self-test just
kind of cool to have included and oh
right sorry a couple more things molex
to floppies there's two just in case you
need them again very nice black sleeves
are not black sleeve black wires and
then there's this guy right here so
that's the comport so Lou uh whoops
slick and I
that could be short for anything a slick
and I deduced that there's probably some
kind of a cable that plugs into here but
we couldn't figure out where it was and
then we kind of went oh maybe it's in
the cable bag so we dug through it and
that is where you are able to plug in
this to here and then the link to here
and then that to go in there and that to
USB and then slick sort of was like well
if this is going to be mounted inside
your case somewhere you should probably
come with like double sided tape on the
back to which I responded Wow
because there's double-sided tape
included in the little accessory baggie
of course there's good at these kinds of
things so the ax 1200 eye is right side
up no matter which way you mount your
power supply oh you can do it again Oh
didn't work cables are too twisted um
great luxe great performance what else
is there to really say Corsair lint
compatibility is going to be huge for
the Tweaker and the gamer who really
wants to monitor every last detail their
system and I think that pretty much
wraps us up so thank you for checking
out my unboxing your first look at the
Corsair a X 1280 + Platinum power supply
don't forget to subscribe to - tech tips
from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos
okay so I know I didn't throw it off a
building but I'm sort of hoping this
will make my point so even if your
courier like really abuses it bearing in
mind that your box will be sealed and we
probably should have taped it shut
before we did this because that caused
the box to to open so there you go
there's some awesome crush damage on the
corner there there's so this is about as
bad as you could expect it to arrive
from your courier and then we're going
to go ahead and investigate here so you
can see that there's enough foam padding
here to choke a horse or at least stop a
fall from damaging your power supply and
because it's a soft foam I I know I harp
on soft foam but because it's a soft
foam there's also no damage to the foam
which means we could actually throw it
out of the car again and it would
survive whereas with a hard foam once
it's broken the structural integrity is
dead and not windy it's going to blow
away old paper and then I'll be a
litterer okay so we're going to pull
power supply and determine that it is
indeed unscathed within its protective
packaging oh so good don't forget to
