the minnow HD the first thing that comes
up is it wants me to set the date this
is camera man's idea so I don't know
exactly what we're gonna do with it but
okay oh there we go oh it has a little
sound effect so it's March and then it
is the eight two three four five six
camera man's giving me a hint so what he
doesn't realize is I actually have my
other phone here so that I can cheat and
the year is 2010 that's right okay so
we're pressing okay oh it's very
sensitive I actually barely touched it
okay and then the time is 4 p.m. so why
don't I go this way no no it doesn't
matter so it's for this is very slow and
boring but hopefully you'll all bear
with me here we're just setting the time
and date on our new camera is p.m. in
the afternoon those tones are kind of
obnoxious let's turn them off and we're
gonna save the settings so that was it
that was really easy okay so here you
can see the time left is sixty minutes
this is the four gig model and we've got
like the live oh yeah you don't want to
put your finger in front of the screen
because then it doesn't work very well I
couldn't figure out what that blurriness
all along the bottom was but I figured
out it was my finger and the camcorder
is empty okay so then all you really do
is press the button and then it starts
recording so that's we could even record
my phone so then we're looking at a
screen through a screen through a screen
if you're the cameraman which is not
really all that interesting but that's
okay okay so in a minute we're actually
gonna film an unboxing with the Minow HD
we're gonna do a retro unboxing and we
are going to unbox an Athlon 64 FX 51 so
we'll get to that in just a moment so I
figured we might as well show you the
other aspects of how to use this thing
so in order to playback the video we
just took all you have to do is press
play
and it starts playing immediately and
then if you don't want to hear it
playing anymore then you just press play
again so you can Fats play and pause I
guess you could call it that and then
you can skip to the next video which
doesn't exist because we only have one
video on here right now while you're
playing you can turn the volume up or
down so that's pretty cool and then if
you're sick of hearing that video you
can oh okay hold on you hold the
trashcan to unlock and then you delete
the video and you can click yes there we
go so we deleted the video we took now
we're gonna do our Athlon 64 FX 51
