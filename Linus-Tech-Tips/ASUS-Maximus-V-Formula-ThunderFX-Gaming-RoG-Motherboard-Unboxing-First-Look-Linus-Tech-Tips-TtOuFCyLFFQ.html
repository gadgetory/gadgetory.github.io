the soos ROG series Maximus 5 formula
this is the thunder FX version and there
will be more on what makes it Thunder
effects but there is a plain formula
version as well it includes the Diablo 3
mousepad that's kind of cool support for
Intel Core i3 i5 and i7 processors from
their third generation line of CPUs
Intel z77 chips that means you get all
those usual features including SRT 4 SSD
caching as well as virtue MVP for
accelerating your GPU experience and
allowing you to use your integrated
graphics for video transcoding in your
dedicated graphics for gaming supports
2-way SLI or Quad SLI with two dual GPU
cards and up to 3-way crossfire X or
quad crossfire X with two dual GPU cards
here are some highlight features
including Fusion thermal completely
redesigned thermal design thermal
dissipation design for the vrm supreme
FX 4 which has some really cool new
innovations we'll talk more about those
later thunder FX is included on this
version and we'll definitely talk about
that more later in diablo 3 mousepad
also included let's go ahead and get
this bad boy opened up so some more
features we'll talk about those as we
get it opened up comes with a Diablo 3
mousepad which is here and you can get
it you know how to get that out oh here
at the top there's an envelope take you
thing all right this is the Thunder FX
so the thunder FX this yeah this is the
kind of thing that is a tremendous value
add for a board like this so yes you're
spending a bunch of money on a board but
if you're a frequent upgrader sometimes
you can get well I hate to say burned a
little bit but you can get burned a
little bit on spending a ton of money on
these premium boards only to find out
that there's nothing you can really
carry forward with you in the future
well the Thunder FX is something that
you will be able to so this is okay what
do they have to say for themselves
versatile gaming audio for PC and
consoles right is compatible with any
device tablet phone PC console doesn't
matter it is capable of driving up to
300 ohm resistance headphones and uses
premium capacitors for pure powerful
audio supreme sound accessory that your
console and
or entertainment enjoyment requires so
let's have a look at what they've got in
terms of spec they're using a C media 66
31 audio processor they're using as I
recall I have notes on this so why don't
we get more into it rated actually let's
just put this aside for now so let's
check out the board first we've got
under FX audio solution so we'll take a
closer look at that there's the USB
interface and then you can also just use
a standard stereo input which will allow
it to amplify the signal and I'll switch
to wherever you need it to go so there's
your headphones as well as your
microphone in xbox360 voice in is also
included that's pretty cool this is
awesome check this out so this
microphone port right here is actually
for active noise-cancelling so if you
paired this with say for example a
Seuss's uh they go vulcan noise
cancelling headphones you would have
multiple rounds of noise cancelling
going on so you would have the closeness
of the headphones you would have the
noise canceling built into the
headphones and then you'd have a
microphone actively listening to what is
the ambient noise around you and then
canceling that out at the sound card
level which is very very cool so I also
got here you can switch between PC Xbox
360 and ps3 mode you can also switch the
oh yeah you just got a volume knob and
then that's pretty much it for the
physical attributes of the unit so this
probably reminds you guys a little bit
of the essence one that we took a look
at a while ago so it's more like it's a
it's well it's not quite an essence one
which is like a $600 USB DAC and
amplifier itself I mean this one's
bundled with a motherboard but it's
along the same lines in terms of trying
to deliver the best possible quality
audio so there are advantages actually
this is in line with their with their
redline concept so you see the red line
that actually separates all of the audio
components on the PCB from the rest of
the PCB this is to reduce interference
there's also shields here to again
reduce stray interference and there is
an advantage to keeping it separated
from the PCB that way you then get a
further
advantage going with something like a
high-end zone our sound card and putting
that in a PCI slot or PCI Express slot
because then you're further removing
yourself from all the hoo-ha that's
going on inside your PC case by removing
it even further and plugging in via USB
you can almost completely eliminate it
so that's one of the reasons and people
do like using these external USB sound
cards so let's start with just an
overall look at the layout of the board
so one thing that you guys are probably
going to be wondering about right right
off the bat is the Republic of gamers
logo in the middle they have brought
back the breathing I so it is no longer
just illuminated it is not not
illuminated it has a breathing pulsating
effect going on right under your CPU
socket so that should look really really
cool once we've got it powered on um I
jump straight to the border into
accessories just say alright coming back
to the board will do accessories later I
guess so couple things I want to mention
is it comes with a full one-year copy of
Kaspersky and comes with a full copy of
daemon tools which is kind of neat one
thing to note though guys about formula
boards versus extreme boards because in
theory like you know an extreme level
board should have everything a formula
level board so why is it that you can
get this under FX one with a formula
board and not with an extreme board and
why does the formula board have this
super high-end onboard audio which we'll
get more into later and not an extreme
board the reason for that is that Asus
is trying to appease the different
market segments so an extreme Buy or
user is not necessarily even going to
want to use on board audio no matter how
good it is they're probably going to
want to buy like a dedicated couple
hundred dollars on our sound card to
throw on it so there's no point
providing them with that high-end
onboard audio anyway although it'll
still be pretty decent so networking
there we go
so they're using Intel networking again
however they have completely redesigned
the Intel game first technologies that
allows you to prioritize gaming or
prioritize other applications depending
on what you need and you can not only
use it on the Intel Gigabit Ethernet but
you can also use it on the included
Wi-Fi network module and even if you add
a third party NIC like say even a
multi-port NIC you can still use the
soft
that's built into AI suite - in order to
prioritize different applications in and
get the best possible experience so if
you even if you load something in here
you can still use game first - which has
been completely rewritten from game
first one in order to provide better
compatibility and a more seamless
overall experience
the reason Isis went with Intel versus
killer for this particular application
because I if you guys have seen some
high-end motherboards are using killer
networking is that they wanted that
flexibility to allow you to use it not
only on this one network connection here
but also on everything else as well so I
want to talk about the PCI Express slot
layout it's going to run in 16 X 8 X 8 X
or it will run in 8 X 4 X 4 X now these
are all running directly off of the CPU
and they are all pcie 3.0 enabled slots
which means that even if you're running
8 for 4 that's equivalent to PCIe to 16
8 8 which is plenty of bandwidth
assuming you're using newer generation
video cards that use PCIe 3/4 3-way
crossfire configuration however Nvidia
doesn't allow for X lots for SLI so
you'll be limited to two-way SLI
but one cool thing that you should
notice guys is that as you may have seen
a soos is doing a lot of triple slot
graphics cards with their direct cu2
cooler and there's a lot of boards that
aren't really compatible with multi-gpu
configurations with these cards well
they thought of that and they went okay
well let's leave huge spacing in between
the slots so that you can even use to
triple slot PCI Express cards and still
you're left with a PCIe 4x slot for
expansion whether you want to throw a
raid card in there a network card in
there or whatever else you have a desire
for so moving on to the vrm you can't
really see it very well but something to
note is that asus haven't gone overboard
in terms of how many phases that they
have built into the voltage regulation
modules are in to dwell in to the power
delivery system on this board instead of
going with huge like multi a huge multi
phase design they've gone with a lower
phase design that uses higher-end
components in order to make sure that
the taller
says are as low as possible and speaking
of low tolerances they've also gone with
a slightly different overall take on the
component sourcing than some of their
competitors have as well so while okay
while it's interesting to see what a
capacitor is rated for in terms of
current delivery at 105 degrees because
that seems to a normal user you'd go
okay yeah that's a highly stressful
environment so that probably represents
a worst case scenario there are power
delivery designs that will perform
extremely well at 105 degrees Celsius
but then will actually suffer in terms
of their efficiency at a more realistic
temperature like maybe 70 degrees which
is what you might encounter in a typical
gamer system so a sous Wanted whether
you're using extreme cooling all over
your system you're going to be water
cooling you're vrm and you know you're
going to be going all out on that or
whether you're going to be going for
like a silent system and it's going to
be running completely passive with very
little air flow around it they want it
to perform well no matter what scenario
that you're going to use it in so
they're using Niki con GT caps and this
is the same design they were using on
their x79 boards and if it can handle
x79
then d77 shouldn't be a problem also
something that ASA specifically asked me
to point this out is that they adhere
fully to Intel spec in terms of the
build quality of the socket itself the
components that go around the socket
itself and it's not just the marketing
spec of what they've built over here but
they can actually deliver the quality of
power that they're generating to the CPU
itself and not all solutions are built
equal in this manner it's also worth
remembering that it comes with all the
usual Asus features so there's actually
8 4 pin PWM fan connectors scattered all
over the board love seeing stuff like
that there's two in here and you can use
fan expert 2 in order to control them
some boards have fan control options but
not all the ports are supported that's
not the way that it works with the Asus
one and you can even use external
temperature probes in order to control
those fans so it has up to three
and I can't remember where all the slots
are there's one so you just hook up
these probes and you can run them
wherever you want them to go I think
there's one sort over here somewhere
anyway there's three run them wherever
you want them to go whether it's a hard
drive and then you have your chassis fan
plugged in in the front you make sure
your hard drive stays cool if it's
getting too warm or wherever you want to
put them you can adjust your fan curves
in order to make sure that everything
stays appropriately cool you've also got
y'all your usual staff including USB
boost which gives you better performance
out of your USB 3 ports you've also got
a I charger which supports not only
Apple devices but also Android devices
for accelerated charging over your USB
ports there's the Thunderbolt header
which is present on almost all of these
c77 boards which where is it it's right
here somewhere so time to pull header
right there so there's the Thunderbolt
header which is allows you to add
Thunderbolt retro actively to this board
even though it doesn't include it it
supports usb BIOS flash back which
basically doesn't really need anything
actually hold on let us let's let me
find that no button required folks you
just renamed the BIOS file to this file
name right here you put it in the ROG
connect port and then you restart the
system and there's some flashing lights
that indicate when the BIOS is flashed
remember you can use USB bio flash back
without even a CPU or memory installed
in the board all right moving right
along then fusion thermo this is cool so
there's a heat pipe in here right there
and then there is also a water channel
so you can either use air cooling or
liquid cooling and while it'll perform
perfectly well with air cooling and
they've designed it if they're actually
using these the special coating that
enables better heat conduction all that
good stuff
the heat pipe in there blah blah all
this it's a greater cooler however you
can get phenomenal performance with it
by using a water cooling setup so these
are 3/8 Barb's and there's a little
there a little bit narrower on the board
than I would have liked to see however
the restriction shouldn't be too bad
because I saw a cutaway diagram of how
the how the routing of the tube is done
inside and they're using very smooth
curves rather than using sharp 90
degrees like you often see you know non
water cooling oriented companies do so I
would expect this to not really slow
down your flow rate that much
I'm very excited to see that a Seuss has
made some significant improvements to
the quality of their water cooling
versus what they were doing back in 2007
so it uses all nickel and copper which
means you're not going to run into any
corrosion issues if anyone had a Foxconn
blackops board and actually tried to
water cool at you know what I'm talking
about those things corroded like crazy
and just fell apart so a soos has
figured all that out and they want you
to be running this board two three four
or five years down the line without
without wealth yes falling apart so
moving on to the subpoena FX for audio
this is discrete class audio and you
look at how big the actual PCB that is
laid aside for your onboard audio is and
it's almost a sound card worth of space
so it shouldn't be that surprising that
they're able to build in a fair amount
of quality there so the redline
shielding actually is a physical
separation of the PCB which is very very
cool and then they're using Elna premium
audio caps so those are all here and
then this guy right here is kind of
special this is a 1500 micro farad
massive cap so what a soos is calling it
a massive cap so what does this allow
you to do it allows you to store power
in reserve for when you need it so let's
say you know you're creeping down the
hallway things really quiet and the boom
there's an explosion that requires
additional power draw that can't
necessarily be delivered on the fly by
the normal power delivery system that
would go to something like an onboard
sound card so this capacitor right here
is holding power in reserve so it can
deliver that responsiveness in that
punchiness as soon as you need the
additional power to go to your sound
card so that's a really neat design
choice that they've made they also went
with audio grade caps which are
different so there are higher okay
higher quality capacitors than what
they're using on here in terms of the
current they can deliver however audio
caps use completely different
electrolytic content and completely
different foil to give a certain
tonality to the noise versus just
managing power which is what regular
caps are more about so there's some
differences in how they respond to the
requests and soos believes that the
experience that they have in does
in audio products now I mean they've
been doing zonar for a while including
some very high-end stuff has given them
some big advantages over what their
competitors are doing in terms of
discreet grade onboard audio and I'm
really excited to try this one out
because between the 300 ohm headphone
amp just here and the the shielded chip
as well as the audio grade caps and the
super cap super get massive caps sorry
my bad and the massive cap I'm expecting
this to deliver a very good audio
experience with started thanks a
question why would they include this
with it and I guess it's that you have
like like the best and then like the
even like best wrists included with the
same with the same board and you have
the flexibility of using that on
something else even when you no longer
using this motherboard which is kind of
neat now let's go back to my regular
programming so there's your LGA 1155
socket lots of space around it for
aftermarket coolers you've got your vrm
cooling here which I think we've talked
about plenty already your 8 pin + 4 pin
power connectors are in their ideal
location at the top left of the board
and then moving along the top of the
board you got some more CPU headers
you've got some ah there's a debug LED
so if you don't want to use this though
remember guys you always have the option
of using ROG connect so there's the
button to turn it on there's the pork
for it and that's where you plug in a
separate computer in order to you can
monitor things like temperatures you can
change overclocking settings you can see
ah yes if you're booting up and for
whatever reason you don't want to look
inside your case lean over and look at
the debug LED it'll give you a plain
text version of any kind of error so if
you accidentally turn the computer
without rad in it plug this in it'll
just save it all this is like there's no
RAM so you better put Cerreta which is
kind of neat ok slow mode don't worry
about that unless you're going below 10
degrees Celsius so our below negative 10
degrees Celsius so leave it off for for
now you've got onboard switches start
and reset you've got your Go button
which works as a memo pay button as well
so for whatever reason you're not
posting that'll set it to very very safe
settings and get you going you've got
all your onboard here you want to get a
close look at that all your onboard
voltage readouts so you don't have to
trust the BIOS you can actually get ones
with you can get readouts with a
multimeter you've also got not either
neat so these are little Buddha
LEDs that tell you the status of things
as you're booting up you've also got
your ln2 mode jumper so don't worry
about that unless usually using liquid
nitrogen 24 pin connectors in its ideal
location along the right-hand edge your
front USB 3 connector is in its ideal
location along the right-hand edge and
they've also changed the configuration
of the SATA ports a little bit here too
so there's only four SATA ports here
that are running off the Intel chipset 2
SATA 2 ports running at 3 gigabit per
second to say 2 3 6 gigabit per second
ports and all four of these are running
off of as media chipsets so while you
don't have the caching feature that you
get on the third-party Marvelle
controllers you do have better
performance with these as media ones so
that's why SUSE opted for that so you
have a total of 6 C 2 3 6 gigabit per
second ports and 2 SATA 2 3 gigabit per
second ports remember you can still run
caching off of the Intel ports should
you so desire all your front panel
connectors are here TPM your thunderbolt
headers down here talked about that
already to front USB 2.0 connectors
auxiliary power in case you are running
multiple GPUs although if you're running
only 2 should be fine your front panel
audio connector on the other side of the
thin red line and aa slot layout so
we've talked about this a little bit
already but three PCIe 1x slots three
PCIe 16x slots and a PCIe 4x slot make
up all of that so the pulsating and I
just you guys know you can if you for
whatever reason don't like it you can
unplug it and tuck it in there without
damaging the board in the slightest up
here this is cool
so this is an N PCIe combo and what
we're going to do is we're actually
going to show you guys what goes on on
this guy so this is just a little check
this up so you can use there's n PCIe
and then there's also a and n SATA slot
and it supports both of them and then
you plug the whole thing into this
module right here that sits up at the
top of the board like this so you can
see there's already a dual band Wi-Fi
module plugged in here
wherever the where are the antenna ports
give me a sec so these two little
nubbins have little adapters that plug
into them and then you plug the full
sized antennas into them and run them
out of the back of the case so that's
the mini PCIe card that they include did
ice already say it was dual
and Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth 4.0 okay
cool and then there's your M SATA slot
so you can plug in an additional SSD
should you so desire and put pull thing
on here like this
aha okay so I'm not going to put loops
we're not going to put that on for now
but let's have a look at some more
accessories so there's your antennas
that go with that
you got some included SATA cables for
say two three six gigabit per second
cables to say two to three gigabit per
second cables you've got an included ro
D flexi black SLI connector the very
best kind these are all related to
thunder FX so we're gonna hold off on
those for now io shield helpfully
labeled these are great so you can label
all your hard drive cables so you make
sure you're not boot disks make sure you
don't accidentally unplug the wrong
thing at any given time there's your
user guide which is extremely thick and
extremely thorough I think this is the
thickest user manual I've seen from an
asus motherboard yet and we've used it a
couple times throughout this unboxing to
clarify things and it's very helpful
driver disk don't use that though
download the latest I'm gaming Do Not
Disturb door hanger very cool ROG
sticker with instructions for
application ROG connect cable as well as
few connectors for the front making it
easier to plug in your front USB and
front power in one fell swoop so let's
finish up with the rear i/o clear CMOS
ROG connect three USB 2.0 ports four USB
3.0 ports eSATA DisplayPort and HDMI out
optical audio in and out Gigabit
Ethernet and 7.1 audio with like the
beastliest onboard audio powering it
very good stuff so now let's move along
to the flood gah FX so this should not
be confused with Thunderbolt which is
totally different
although the board does support a fun
durable add-on card this is thunder FX
this is all about sound so we've looked
at it physically now let's talk about
what makes it special so accessory wise
it comes with a USB cable which has two
USBs on one end and one on the other end
that
that it can get enough power okay we've
got an Xbox adapter as well as out a
more different Xbox adapter for your
microphone in good stuff and that's
pretty much it in terms of included
accessory cables so just wanted to
clarify something that I numbed out on
before so this is noise canceling for
your microphone not for your headphones
themselves so you will need noise
cancelling headphones which do their own
noise canceling for what you hear but

this go oh I must have left it at home
okay well if the microphone was plugged
in I'd be talking into my microphone and
this would be isolating the random
ambient noise from the sound coming in
through my microphone in order to make
sure that whoever I'm talking to here's
me clearly even if I'm at a crowded land
center so I think that pretty much wraps
this up thank you for checking out my
