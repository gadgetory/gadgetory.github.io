singularity computers the guys that have
been behind some of the craziest
computer mods in the world and their
Spectre case which should begin shipping
to consumers in the next few months
isn't just compatible with water cooling
it integrates water cooling directly
into the case with a pump and a
reservoir built right into the back
panel so then let's build an
unnecessarily powerful computer in it
right what are we waiting for this
message from our sponsor synergy -
synergy - makes sharing one mouse and
keyboard between multiple computers so
simple and seamless that anyone can use
it check it out today at the link below
the first steps were to take off the top
panel thread our motherboard standoffs
into the acrylic backplate and add an
RGB strip to the top for some sweet
sweet edge lighting action next we added
plugs to our triple 120 millimeter
radiators from bits power to a avoid a
repeat of last time
then we pre tapped the radiator holes
and tried to attach them to the case but
without luck our case is actually a
little bit too thick so we're gonna have
to live without our orange anti
vibration dampers the wires for the RGB
and front i/o then needed to be hidden
under the front panel and as it turns
out front USB wires are a lot thicker in
real life than they are in CAD so
getting the front panel back on was
quite a struggle something that should
be fixed in the next prototype now the
choice of CPU for this project was
pretty easy we went with the 18 core
core I 979 ATX e extreme edition and
since the point of this case is no
compromises water cooling well we took
our CPU for a spin in our der Bauer X
299 D living tool replacing the stock
thermal compound with a very light
application of liquid metal
now we're not expecting to break any
world records but we would like to get
close and replacing the Tim on these
chips is a must for the best
overclocking results our GPU choice was
equally simple but Titan V is the most
expensive and most powerful consumer ish
card on the market now to water cool
this bad boy you first remove all the
screws from the bottom to release the
factory heatsink and wow holy crap
there's a lot of thermal compound in
here so the next thing you'll need to do
is clean all of that off replace it with
some thermal grisly cry knot and then
attach Ashram XE full cover water block
like this one from bits power the
motherboard a prime X 299 deluxe from
Asus is also getting the water cooling
treatment now if you guys think that the
theme of this build is water cooling
then you are wrong if
LTT orange and black duh anyway we
removed the vrm heatsink added thermal
pads and then screwed on our bits power
full cover block with the components
installed we threw in 128 gigs of Triton
see RGB Ram
you gotta fill up all those slots right
installed our fittings and then got down
to planning out the loop so for the
first couple of hard line bends it was
basically measure cut bend test fit get
the length perfect and then move right
on to the next but as we progress
through the loop the bends got
increasingly difficult like this little
guy up in the corner here needed to be
done freehand something that Alex had
never done before and while the rest
were made a little bit easier with our
brand new kit from alpha cool it needed
a little bit of modification
so now it's gonna be totally straight up
and down
perfect a couple more bends later the
loop was complete
so for storage we used three one
terabyte SSDs in raid zero so that's you
know pretty cool for wow factor but not
quite as cool as the RGV SSD covers from
v1 tech that we installed on them so
huge shout out to Hasan for those and
for the LTTE themed GPU backplate with
the computer temporarily wired up to our
C Sonic 1,000 watt 80 + platinum power
supply we were ready to see if it posted
and oh wow well you know what it's okay
it just wouldn't be an LT T themed build
if it powered on the first time would it
so to fix the problem Ivan and Alex came
in on a Sunday to completely disassemble
the computer and test everything as it
turns out the culprit was some errant
silicon this stuff is used to glue
deleted cpus back together but some of
it got on one of the contact pads on the
bottom already
so after reassembly and some finishing
touches it was time to fill the loop
with tap water to check for leaks and
confirm that it was in fact totally
working then drain it and add some
orange premix to finish off the LTTE
look so with the build done we think it
looks awesome but if you haven't decided
if you agree yet sit back and enjoy some
eyeball tickling glam footage
it was never
but don't be fooled into thinking that
this is just a pretty face as expected
thanks to the ample radiator mount
points and the open design of the
specter not to mention our high quality
cooling blocks the thermal performance
of this thing is nothing short of
fantastic
so at stock clocks we left this thing
running Unigine Valley benchmark
overnight and the max CPU core temp was
43 degrees with the Titan V topping out
at 42 while boosted to an outstanding
1912 megahertz then after some
overclocking things got even more
interesting so check this out with all
18 cores running at 4.8 gigahertz
Cinebench looks a little something like
this
the brow crazy I mean there is basically
nothing this thing cannot absolutely -
through it's a total beast and while
it's hardly an amazing price to
performance machine in terms of raw
benchmarking prowess it scored number
five in the world taking that spot for
Canada in 3d mark and that is with a
single graphics card pretty flippin
astonishing so yeah it costs 11 grand
but basically nothing on the market can
beat it for performance or my opinion
for looks so special thanks to James
from singularity computers for all his
help getting this put together we are
stoked to see the final product from you
guys when it hits the market almost as
stoked as we are to tell you guys about
fresh books fresh books is the small
