my oil-cooled workstation into your life
you invite potential problems so while I
was extremely disappointed to see that
spot had left an oil patch on my desk
from a leak that formed near the seam in
the back when the system was roughly
handled during our move I knew what I
was getting into when I built an oil
cooled PC so let's make lemons out of
this life that lemonade something oil
cool rig maintenance video time
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more step 1 is to
identify the cause of the leak be it a
crack or a fail bond at a joint between
two pieces of acrylic if it's a very
very slow leak like mine the temptation
to just put a drip pan under it and call
it a day will be pretty strong but small
drips can turn into gallons of oil all
over your floor very quickly with all of
that pressure on them so I recommend
finding a helper putting your system on
a plank that you don't care about and
moving it to a suitable place for
repairs as soon as possible step 2 is to
prepare your workspace for the tank
itself garbage bags are a cheap spill
proof cover material for the table and
floor where you're working but I'd
recommend also creating a ridge around
the outside of the area and or pairing
them with cardboard or newspaper to
absorb excess spilled oil in case it
drips off of the edges of your bags
you'll also need a place to put the
internal computer components my system
can hang off of the edge of a large
collection bin but you might need to
come up with your own creative solution
here whatever it is you do make sure
that you've got lots of garbage bags and
lots of paper towels on hand step 3 lift
the system out of the oil we gave it a
good 60 seconds for oil to drip from the
video card power supply and heatsink
fins before picking it up resting it on
a bin to collect the waste oil you can
let it go for longer but if your plan is
to let all the oil come off this way
then be prepared to wait for literally
days at this stage the tank is ready to
be emptied or if there's nothing wrong
with your tank and you're just
performing some system maintenance
removing stickers with failed adhesive
swapping up memory sticks etc then you
can do that now step 4
it's time to prepare two basins one for
rocks and accessories and the other to
capture the rest of the oil from the
machine if you're going to reuse the oil
like me
then it's a really good idea at this
point to clean out the container before
pouring oil into it mineral oil is a
great cleaner and solvent in and of
itself and will pick up all kinds of
dust and grime from anything that it
touches so unless you want that junk
floating around in front of your video
card do a really good job of this then
depending on what kind of container
you're using a funnel might come in
handy here as well something I really
wish we'd thought of when we originally
built this machine so make sure you
clean that too if you're not planning to
reuse the oil please contact a local
waste management depot or failing that
ask an automotive shop where they take
their oil to be disposed of correctly
step 5
pouring the oil out and removing the
rocks when it comes time to dump the oil
I'd recommend changing into clothes that
you don't care about assuming you
haven't already
mineral oil can be very difficult to get
out of clothing and again if you haven't
already I'd recommend removing any
jewelry and throwing on some gloves
because it is about to get messy now to
be clear mineral oil isn't particularly
harmful and is actually present in many
cosmetics and household items not to
mention its usefulness as a laxative but
it's extremely slippery so getting it
all over yourself isn't recommended
either find a muscly armed young
gentleman to help you avoid throwing out
your back while you pour out the oil
into your collection Basin for step 6
now that the tanks empty we can get a
better look at the damage while our
earlier inspection of the leak revealed
that the oil was only seeping out at the
very bottom there are actually numerous
hairline fractures in the adhesive
holding together the joint at the back
of our tank these were probably caused
by the vibration from transporting the
system in the back of a u-haul so I
forgot for a minute that I should be
driving really really slow because
things are only somewhat secured in the
back
look at this guy not letting me get what
a check house so it's time to patch him
up as best we can with the repair guide
that was sent to me by John from Puget 1
wipe down the surfaces to be repaired
there's no need to get every last bit of
oil off mineral is actually what they
use to clean the surfaces before welding
but in our case because there was no
single obvious crack I actually needed
to clean it quite well to see what was
going on - if you can identify the crack
drill a small hole like the smallest bit
you have at the edges of the crack to
keep it from spreading any further for
us however because these micro cracks
are actually between the overlapped
pieces of the main tank we're just going
to have to rely on the wicking abilities
of our weld on acrylic adhesive to fill
in those gaps next well we apply the
acrylic adhesive with the application
bottle and needle then leave that for an
hour to cure finally we apply this
completely not dangerous sounding stuff
over the cracked area the same way that
you would apply caulking to a seal in
your bathroom then allow it 24 hours to
cure step 7 is to come back to it the
next day and just kind of visually
inspect our caulking along the bottom
end up the seam in the middle make sure
it seems like it's evenly distributed
and then once that's done all that's
left is the usual you know oil PC stuff
so we were able to put the rocks back in
spreading them out and then basically
just dumped the oil in doing this more
slowly would have helped me avoid
plunging my arm into the tank to
reposition the rocks and decorations but
honestly I was kind of in a hurry to get
this video films by that point so Yolo
and then with that finished it was time
to submerge the system itself carry it
back upstairs and power it on
successfully even yay worked so overall
I'd say that with a helper adequate time
thanks to my laptop it's not a huge deal
for my desktop to be out of commission
for a day for repairs and with a
suitable workspace the results were
satisfactory the leak is now sealed
and what'll PC maintenance was not as
bad as I thought but it still doesn't
change my original recommendation at the
end of the oil PC bill blog that most
people should stay away from it unless
they want to go through this kind of a
process every time their PC stops
running like a well-oiled machine
speaking of running like a well-oiled
machine it seems like without fail every
time there's a power bank deal to be had
on Linus tech tips hero is the one
providing it and they are kicking off
some Black Friday deals as well as
introducing a few new products into
their power plus three lineup so the
full details of the Black Friday deals
are going to be available at the link in
the video description but in the
meantime we've got the power plus three
premium here featuring twenty thousand
one hundred million powers of capacity
with three output ports through which
you can simultaneously charge three
devices with a total output amperage of
4.4 amps and a maximum of 3 amps per
port you can actually even charge a new
MacBook if you have their USB a 2 type C
adapter cable with the estimated time to
full charge being four and a half hours
also announced is their power plus three
mini with a 6700 milliamp power battery
and the power plus three stick they
haven't actually specified the size of
the battery in it but they do say it
charges the iPhone 6 1 so we can assume
it's somewhere in the neighborhood of
1800 milliamp hours for deals on these
and many other cheero products check out
the link in the video description below
so that's pretty much it guys thanks for
