am building something so huge that I
don't even fit next to it welcome to
personal rig 2015 upgrade part 4 so if
you've been following along up till now
I've introduced the hardware I have
introduced the I don't remember what the
second video was about I have introduced
yes my friends the birth of the case
right the second one was designing it
and now I am finally going to build it
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster check out
the link in the video description to try
it for free so this was a bit of a
rollercoaster of a build for a variety
of reasons it started out actually like
I was really excited because I have this
great concept I've designed the case
from scratch with help from Tarun and
proto case and like it finally arrived
and I'm like yeah I've got this new
concept for picking my system and
putting in a completely different room
to achieve true silence and then I
looked at my old Rick and I was like
it's actually kind of hard to say
goodbye I've been using that case that
tjo 7bw for nine years it was a gift
from my then girlfriend now wife
I have polished it I have dremeled it
and cut it I have painted it I have
stripped all the paint I have painted it
again and we have been through a lot and
between that and the radiator in the
front that's my first ever water cooling
radiator that I've been using for 12
years I'm leaving behind some of the
pieces of like my PC enthusiast history
that actually ended up meaning a little
bit more to me than I had originally
thought that they did but hey the builds
got to go on so it started with
carefully extracting the motherboard
being really careful not to chip that
extremely fragile paint job that I gave
it way back in this controversial video
here and grabbing some of the components
that I'm gonna carry with me so the CPU
the 59 60 x8 core that's coming with me
so is that gold-plated Apogee block from
Swift Tech and actually this is a funny
one my optical drive is coming with me
because it handles CDs DVDs HD DVD and
blu-ray all in one drive not to mention
it has LightScribe yes I'm sure someone
somewhere on earth cares about
LightScribe one thing that won't be
coming with me is these UV LEDs these
are the worst lighting solution I have
ever encountered they stopped working
within one
two weeks and then the UV light actually
causes the resin to turn to like stone
and crack it's ridiculous so the Rams
new here we've got 64 gigs of corsair
dominator Platinum's I installed them
the way that I do install Ram not a
whole lot to say about that the radiator
was a whole other story this was a tight
fit at the front and it actually took
quite a while to get the cables for the
front panel connectors as well as front
USB kind of out of the way enough to get
it just barely wedged in there and then
I equipped it with three of those LTT
addition knocked when ff12 fans now
these are pretty quiet fans but honestly
I'm the kind of person where if this
system was actually sitting next to my
head on my table I would be fan
controlling them but I ended up not
carrying the T balancer forward and I'm
just using two of these little molex to
three fan connector cables that cable
wad made up for me with turns out they
actually kind of screwed them up a
little inadvertently they didn't screw
them up they're fine but they're three
pin whereas the fans are four pin so
they didn't fit so I had to cut them and
then hot glue them together to secure
the cables anyway it's all fine it's all
good so my point is that I would
normally use a fan controller but I
didn't have to because the whole point
of this build is to have it in a room
away from me the SSD was the next thing
I tackled while I was waiting for the
glue gun to warm up and this was a bitch
I could not get the stock cooler off I
even tried a heat gun finally I resorted
to a hobby knife to cut the thermal
adhesive on the NAND chips I mean damn
even then it was hard to pry the thing
off the good news though is that the
results are technically worth it Ek you
never cease to amaze me
liquid cooling and SSD who'da thunk it
the other front radiator was I thought
going to be the hardest part of this
build it needed to be precisely cut for
the hard line tubing to get exactly the
right length to sit in between them I'm
running them in parallel and
even once I got that right tightening
down the callers on the fittings was a
freaking nightmare the good news is that
monsoon tubing kit that was provided by
performance pcs is freakin awesome so I
used it to cut the tubing to exactly
that right length it did take a couple
tries even so then with some very
careful and tedious fussing around with
the mounts cuz the rad had to be slid
into place from front to back and then
the tubing had to be pushed in from back
to front and basically I learned a
valuable lesson about if I were to
design this case again I would
definitely not do it this way but I
eventually got it in there and by the
end of it it was not leaking speaking of
not leaking and awesome freakin stuff
recommended by performance pcs this
monsoon reservoir I mean I could talk to
you guys about mounting it or whatever
with screws but instead I'm just going
to talk about how balls-to-the-wall
amazing it looks it uses monsoons
modular system so you can actually
configure it any number of different
ways and they kind of asked me what I
wanted to do and I went gee that looks
complicated you figure something out and
send it to me so they sent it with
cathodes for the bottom but I actually
ended up taking out since I didn't
really have anywhere to put an inverter
and I wanted to go with UV LED lighting
anyway so I took those out but even then
holy crap it looks so cool there's a ton
of options for inlets and outlets
there's a lot of flexibility sort of
once I get to my tubing and the d5 pump
goes right into the end with this like
sick metal cover on it and it all comes
together really nicely and saves me
another tooling run at the same time
freaking sick I didn't think anything
was going to impress me more than my old
t-virus reservoir this one definitely
did on the subject of tubing though this
was a disaster from the start complete
disaster the original plan was to hard
pipe water cool this thing so I broke
out the monsoon kit again I got the heat
gun I got the fancy fittings I started
cutting to the flank except for one
small problem the block for the 750 SSD
so much lower profile than the GPU block
that the bend here ended up being
impossible at least for me so I had to
start evaluating other options even
going as far as to dig up some red
angled fittings that were earmarked for
a project I never ended up completing
and man that would have looked awful but
I was desperate trying to come up with
some way to plumb that card fortunately
by some miracle I found enough between
the random fittings been in my old
system 90-degree fittings and straight
compressions to complete the build if I
was willing to go back to flexible
tubing which I mean sure the runs aren't
just perfect and beautiful and clean
looking as they would be with hardline
but there are a lot of benefits to
flexible tubing it is harder for it to
leak it is easier to work with if you
ever want to upgrade and honestly I'm ok
with it it ended up looking in my
opinion pretty sick anyway and if I'm
being entirely honest with myself it's
going to be installed on a server
cabinet in a closet anyway so I'm
unlikely to ever see the guts unless I'm
working on it which leads us finally to
the conclusion where I guess a lot of
Brandon's sexy b-roll is going to go I
learned a lot about a lot of things I
especially learned a lot about designing
a case it is not as easy as the case
designers out there like George from
Corsair make it look I did a lot of
things right actually this was monsoons
idea having a fill port on the side of
the system in order to make this thing
so easy felt freakin awesome I
personally like the front panel that was
painted by our neighbor over here at
Linus Media Group
he does like helicopter repair and
apparently airbrushing on the side I
love the front panel I loved the concept
of the water cooled rack mount case but
then there were a lot of little things I
could have done to make my life easier
in terms of planning out the tubing runs
better in terms of planning out the
radiator installation better but the
good news is now that system is actually
built I think it looks fantastic
I can't wait to install it and it and my
wife system and the new nas and all that
stuff so there is going to be a part
five of personal rig update 2015 but it
is not this day today is done it's 2:40
in the morning I am ready to go home
today is done and it is finally built
and I am actually very happy with it and
I hope you guys are happy too so thanks
