have talked about this concept on the
wine show for years now especially in
the tech space the idea of a big-box
store is crumbling stores like Best Buy
are starting to dry up and disappear but
that doesn't mean we don't need
brick-and-mortar shops anymore I'm here
to show you what I personally think
could be the solution let me know if I

for quite some time now going to a
big-box electronics store has been
rather inconvenient they very likely
don't have what you're looking for other
than a few diamonds in the rough their
sales staff probably have no idea what
they're talking about and are just going
to fire off specs from the same little
card that lists the price which probably
isn't very low anyways the staff are
also likely on commission and are going
to try to upsell you at every
opportunity and gave and forbid you ever
get on the topic of a service plan
because you might not get out alive but
can you blame them they're probably
underpaid it's very possible that these
sales employees at a big-box store are
at or below the poverty line and they
probably need their Commission gains to
get by a sheep situation for both of you
overpriced products uninformed sales
staff limited selection aggressive and
pushy sales tactics often a waste of
time and money with a hefty side serving
of frustration and annoyance this has
pushed a lot of the techy crowd to
smaller boutique shops mom-and-pop
stores and the on online eat a Lucian's
but the showroom idea is still nice a
lot of the time we want to see a product
in person before we buy it and a limited
selection of the small stores in the
inherent website nature of an e tail
don't allow for that type of interaction
enter sin trend the potential saving
grace of brick-and-mortar during the
reign of Amazon and various other a
tailors the focus of sin trend creative
Park or the sin trend mall seems to
a showroom style experience for new
products with a heavy focus on comfort
and relaxation everyone I asked working
in a shop was clear and open with the
fact that they won't really be having
special sales and they'll be selling
everything at MSRP because of this they
know you're probably going to go find a
better price somewhere else especially
considering there is a really cheap tech
mall literally connected to the same
building they don't need to be pushy for
a sale because sales aren't their metric
the companies involved ranged quite a
bit but the main pc and mobile tech guys
i noticed were msi asu's Intel Acer
Lenovo Toshiba HP Sony HTC sent hyzer
transcend and razor and that's just a
few of what is actually there the floor
layout was split into categories the
first floor was mainly mobile the second
floor was mostly computer hardware and
accessories the third floor was cameras
the fourth floor was more camera stuff
mostly focused on accessories and also
some speakers the fifth floor was
audiophile headphones the sixth floor
was mostly like figurines with Gundams
and stuff like that and the seventh
floor was little kid and toddler stuff
with some other various things scattered
throughout like 3d printers on the
second floor and this crazy cool racing
simulator thing where you actually put
on a full racing suit which didn't
really fit me but then get into the
racing simulator which cost fifty
thousand US dollars but then while you
go around corners and stuff the whole
thing will lift you around and move you
and whatnot and it's super cool and you
can apparently get an actual racing
license there if you take a course and
blah blah blah
anyways that was cool and that's all the
floors for now but in the future they'll
be opening five more floors the eighth
being Explorer the ninth being dine the
10th being dream the 11th being make and
the 12th being show whatever those
actually mean on the first floor intel
was set up showing a wide range of
products and for fun they had these two
racing Sims set up which were wild a
racing chair and racing wheel hooked up
to three massive TVs for an amazing
panoramic racing experience again just
for fun
moving up stairs though is where the
real fun started floor 2 was definitely
for me
stores appear ranged in styles from just
being a straight-up boutique gallery
like a soos as a comfy couch setup where
people can learn how to use their
various products with trained staff that
will also host your birthday party for
you
if you're a customer and give you cake
and presents so random but also so
awesome my favorite store however was
the razor store and I'd say it was the
most popular store there as well they
had everything there from various
potential razor gear setups along the
outer walls to a laptop LAN a desktop
land and even a console fighting game
area tucked away in the corner the vibe
here was great and they had it going on
with a huge range of casual tournaments
and a super welcoming environment people
are encouraged to just hang out as long
as they would like and much like the
rest of the stores in this mall the
sales counter was tiny and mostly
ignored by patrons and staff because it
just wasn't the point I could definitely
see myself going to one of these little
stores if there was one locally for the
amateur tournaments especially the
hearthstone fireside get-togethers which
are awesome let me know what you guys
