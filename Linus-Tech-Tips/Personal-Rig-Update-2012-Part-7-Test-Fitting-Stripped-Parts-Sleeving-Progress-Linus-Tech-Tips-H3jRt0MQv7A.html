seven parts in one of my recent videos
and asked when the next personal rig
update is coming it is finally here I'm
sorry guys I've been super busy and I
just haven't had much time to work on
the project but I do have some updates
so sleeving is progressing here's the 24
pin sorry there's an extra piece of heat
shrink here that will do it the other
end when I'm done with it but yeah
sleeving is progressing so I'm ending up
with cables that are going to look
pretty darn sharp
once I Kate once I bind them all
together and run them in a way that is
that is reasonably nice here's my here's
my 8 pin for the top of the motherboard
you can see I've done two cables per
sleeve which I personally think looks
pretty good I haven't really seen that
done before but sure someone's done it
but yeah so they're those ones will go
around there somehow I've also got my
RMA back for my t-virus reservoir so I
will be integrating that into this build
somehow you can see I'm experimenting
with some fittings over here so this is
my old Big Bang xpower motherboard this
is not the one I'm using just because my
system is running on my test bench down
here so I don't want to I don't want to
tear it apart just yet but I think I'm
going to have to in order to test fit
everything before I send so you can see
the paint's been stripped off of off of
these parts before I send everything in
to be powder-coated because I'm going to
have to make whatever cuts I want to
make in the metal before I do that so
you can see I've made some modifications
to this case in the past so there's a
hole here for running fan cables from
these 292 Mills and the two 120 is that
go in the top but I'll probably want to
widen that and then what I'll also
probably do normally I used to I've
always run the 8 pin under the
motherboard here and then up the top
here because the tj7 use is larger than
normal standoffs but I think what I'm
going to do this time is I'm actually
going to widen this cut that I was using
here for the Seder cables all the way
along the back it'll lose a little bit
of strength but I think I'm willing
- willing to make that sacrifice here so
I'm going to widen that and then run the
8-pin up the back and make some cuts
here for a CPU cut out this is an older
TJ of seven so it doesn't have some of
the features that the newer ones have
cut here for an eight pin cut here to
run the 24 pin and I'll figure out if
there's anything else that I need to do
I still got to figure out how I want to
lay out my eight drives because those
are a bit of a bear in terms of
placement just because they take up a
fair bit of space now there are some
challenges that I have here because all
of you guys are going to be able to see
this but there's some come on focus
there you go there's some Nick's in the
metal here some pieces are even worse
check out this one see it's full of
little pock marks and that was something
to do with the stripping process so not
only that but it completely ate the
threads out of this piece and then
there's one other piece that's having a
bit of trouble with the threads I was
able to put the case back together
though it just means that oh and these
threads are still intact
which is really fortunate because I did
not want to try to rebuild those in any
way you can see here I'm using some
masking tape to dry fit the t-virus res
without scratching it I won't be using
that when I do the final build routing
the water cooling is I think I've pretty
much figured out how I want to do it I
hate having tubing cross
I don't think tubing should cross in a
clean system so what I'm probably going
to do is I'm going to use a ninety
degree fitting here this guy is going to
be more in the front of the case so
closer to closer to over here like right
up at the front so what that means is
you're not going to be able to see that
one then I want to do a hole I'll drill
a hole through this base plate here as
well as through the usb3
front panel thing that I'm going to put
right here in order to get that one down
then I'm going to have this come out
it'll cross the t-virus which I don't
like but I'll have to live with that
it'll go to the Apogee HD Gold down to
here
this will go to the res and the res will
go down to the pump which is going to
sit down here in the basement there's
going to be a lot more room in the bay
but now with without the cabling tidied
up a lot down there hold on let me just
sorry guys I apologize for the Bourne
series like shakey cam that's going on
here so this could be a fair bit of
space down here just because I'm going
to have everything routed really cleanly
so then this will come out it's going to
be pretty tight because it has to go
down to that bottom that bottom tube are
the bottom fitting in order to make sure
that the bubbles bleed more easily then
out here which will go up to right here
up to the second radiator so the eye
would be easier for me if this radiator
could be turned the other way but once
again for ease of bleeding I want to
have the fittings on the top so that the
air bubbles don't get caught in it as
much really don't like the look of being
able to see the power supply here what I
may do is remove the sticker just so
that it's a little bit cleaner looking
I'm going to try to have as few fittings
as I can up here at the top because as
you can sell tell I actually didn't
terminate the ends on the power supply
itself as cleanly as I did the ends that
are going to go to the components sort
of forgetting that I'm going to be able
to see it you guys feel free to post in
the comments let me know what you think
of this tubing placement right here I
will be using my blue tubing but
basically these are going to run around
here then come out a little bit and then
this tube is going to run from here to
here with with silver compression
fittings I just I just don't know about
that one if I can tighten it up a little
bit it might help but I'm just not sure
in terms of SATA cables I've decided to
I've almost decided to go away from my
usual UV reactive SATA cables let me see
if I can just find them they're the ones
that come with Intel's high-end boards
or at least used to come with Intel cyan
boards anyway I can't find it but I
think I'm going to go with this guy
because it does match the color scheme
of the board even though it's not
reactive in any way it's pretty close to
the blue that's on there and it'll allow
me to have a really tidy run so what
I'll do is I'll go straight from the
state
output here then I will bring it through
a hole so I'll cut I'll cut maybe that
hole go further I'm not really sure
through a hole and then up here over and
down to the optical drive now this right
now is screwed into some holes in the
motherboard tray that happened to be
threaded correctly but what I'll
probably do is move it over just a touch
and drill some new holes because it
doesn't look like this is going to quite
fit I may also get a different optical
drive I haven't decided what to do about
that I'm either going to powder coat
this or I'm going to get a different
optical drives that it'll be flash here
it won't be visible this is an older one
it's an HD DVD blu-ray combo drive so
that's why it's so long too many lasers
inside still haven't decided what to do
about the outside of the case that
finishes damage to the point where I
don't want to just leave it but I'm not
really sure if I want to paint it
anymore either I may send it in to be
powder-coated with the rest of the
internal parts but I think the whole
machine is going to look really plain if
I do that so I'm still very much
waffling about that overall nothing
insurmountable the t-virus looks amazing
here I'll show you guys that is going to
be a heck of a centerpiece for this
build on you can't really see it so
bright in here hold on let me turn off
some light that's helping a little bit
can kind of see what its gonna look like
well sorry guys let me just honor I
can't really take that down there that's
okay you can kind of see what it's going
to look like so that's gonna look slick
I'm just gonna go with clear distilled
plain water for the liquid I'm not going
to do any kind of coloration just
because I don't want to deal with the
gunk that inevitably builds up I mean
I've got quite the dye collection let me
tell you I have used a lot of dyes in my
day and there's no there's no winners
where dyes are involved there they are
this is my favorite dye though this is
some awesome fluorescent green stuff
that aqua tuning' way back in the day
yeah I got some moldy tech dye
this stuff was horrible it's not some
fessor dye stuffs alright but eventually
which color was it and I can't remember
there's one color that had that
gunked-up I'm sure they've changed the
formulas instead it's been a long time
since I'd since I've used any of that
stuff oh there's my little triple rat
but I used to be using in the bottle in
my case now I'm using the quadruple so I
think that pretty much does it for my
update for now I still have to I still
have to go to the local glass shop where
they told me they should be able to do a
one-off piece of glass for me so sick of
this gross I scratched up acrylic so I'm
going to get something better for that I
still got to send a wave whatever parts
I decide to send away like this this is
going to be a bit of a challenge because
this is supposed to screw on to this
piece here but because all the threads
are dead what I might end up doing is
riveting it on and then sending the
whole thing to be powder coated as one
piece so I still have a lot of prep to
do before I can before I can go any
further so thank you for checking out
