more guys it's time for part two of our
Linus Media Group headquarters tour so
part one we had a look at slicks domain
which as you can see has changed a
little bit since last time we were in
here for one thing our teleprompter is
on the floor for some reason which is
terrible because these are pretty
fragile with their glass and all that
that is just sort of you know I don't
know what to do with that something here
also slicks leaving food dishes in here
which I clearly need to talk to them
though here's a cereal bowl that's
hopefully from today at the very least
so if Schlitz mom is watching this video
tell them about the cereal bowls I
wanted to take this opportunity to
remind you guys that there is still one
contest running the HTC phone giveaway
is closed we're going to be selecting
the winners soon but the WD Computex
giveaway is still open I've talked to
Western Digital I know that we're not
that close to any of the targets but get
this guys they are still going to honor
the first three tiers even though we
only reached just under the first tier
of prising so they're still giving away
the internal drives they're still giving
away the external drives and they are
still giving away the two puget gaming
systems
very very cool kudos to WD for stepping
up and doing the prising even though you
guys didn't watch enough of the videos
in the playlist of our WD videos from
Computex but it's ok anyway guys it
would be a huge favor to me if you'd go
and check out that playlist share with
someone it just talks about some cool WD
technology that they had on display at
Computex they're going to be honoring
the prizes one way or the other but who
knows maybe if we can you know push
really hard and get a bunch of views on
those now then they'd be able to honor
even more prizes I'm just sort of four
actually there's there's no commits from
their side to do that but just throwing
that out there remember to enter the
contest all you got to do is follow the
instructions in the forum link that's in
the description for this video so I'm
gonna do our second room tour and
Diesel's
whoa leaving apparently so Dargo oh the
doorbell rang evidently okay well
hopefully you'll find out what's going
on the back so this is the editing room
so right here we have a workbench that
clearly I need to do some work on
because it's pretty terrible right now
but this workbench is just basically
because slick has his place to work I
need my place to work and so I'll be
putting together an actual workstation
for myself here at some point we've got
our bag so here is my fancy clothes in
case someone shows up for a meeting or
something no I can pretend that I
actually dressed like a real human being
here's the case that we carry around our
shuttle editing computer in so that's
Diesel's workstation which I've actually
done a video of before this right here
used to be the forum server but we've
since cannibalized it and this is
running a 980 X extreme edition so we're
going to be stripping that apart for
other things and someone needs my wallet
as my life of course that would be what
she needs not that I have any money she
knows that okay so moving right along
this is my workspace where I was testing
out the HD 5 v 5s with the mod mic
whoopsie-daisy there goes earlier today
as thing there we go
with the mod mic earlier today I still
use my MSI quad core gaming notebook as
my workstation even though I've been
meaning to just I just have to put an OS
on this SSD and put this SSD in here and
then I'm going to be switching over to a
extreme edition 965 so this is a quad
cross stream addition on LGA 1366 with a
560 Ti for a little bit of CUDA
acceleration if I can ever figure out
how to use Adobe Premiere I have a pro
monitor that b-roll doesn't know this
yet he's filming right now but I'm
probably going to donate this to him
once I get a new monitor at some point
and take one of his old Ben cues there's
diesel practicing of course his desk for
your discipline
like and all of our all like all of our
prop guns end up next to his workstation
one is not enough evidently he needs to
this will go in like kind of our lounge
area at some point I want to put in like
a TV so there's kind of like a like a
hangout place where we can also film
videos and stuff like that
this is Diesel's workstation so he
there's these are his eyedrops
he recently got LASIK say yay so you can
see now right yes 2020 2020 right now
probably better soon yes sir very cool
yeah look at his glasses no lenses
unbelievable we've told him not to do
this but he doesn't apparently take
fashion advice from me because I wear
socks a sentence actually that's not
even the reason you don't take fashion
advice from music why don't you care
this is interesting let's get why don't
you take fashion advice from me let's
just all right I see how it's gonna be
so we have diesel snacks which are
muffins
we have diesels USB Drive which he got
from gigabyte of all people at Computex
I got one too it's awesome 32 gig data
traveller nice metal chassis diesels
fork what else is here diesels thermal
tape peripherals it's such a fanboy this
isn't actually a really nice keyboard
though very solid built this is the
mecha gg1 if I recall correctly and then
the BMW mouse which I I personally find
a little bit a little bit heavy
Tracking's alright though diesel asked
very politely for speakers when we moved
to the new place so he got them and then
last but not least the pride and joy of
his workstation the 246 from Asus which
is an 8-bit panel meaning he can do all
of his fancy color work on here there's
also a script for an upcoming ninja
video but we're going to be doing soon
and then let's still let's see what
Diesel's been doing here so Borderlands
2 lyrics Borderlands 2 main theme the
heavy the heavy removing stuttering
objects but so you have to like look up
you have to like look up tutorials now I
thought you were supposed to be some
kind of professional after theis After
Effects we're sure yeah
all right what do you want to be rolled
Workstation now I know for a fact that
the subway wrappers from today which
this is from today I'm pretty sure that
I saw my little ways for the subway
yesterday and today I'm alright okay
well here's B rolls phone which is uh
this is what this is a Nexus S right
Galaxy Nexus okay oh you have a call
from Dylan but maybe I'll take this call
no don't don't hold on oh wait
can't talk now call me later okay I
finally I didn't take the call ah okay
pull off Street right here lens time for
cleaning lenses wallet he's dead babe
neither of them knew I was gonna do this
so ah so here we've got dear old
monitors which are like ancient Ben qva
panels he's working on an unboxing for
drive and then b-roll doesn't get
speakers b-roll gets a jam box by
jawbone which really I think shows his
uh you know compactness as an individual
in terms of his skills we've also got V
rolls lenses which have been a huge boon
for Linus media grip because I haven't
had to invest in lenses yet because
b-roll has all the lenses and I would
also be got here bag like a camera in it
or something oh yeah
here are storage closet so this is where
we keep the gear so we've got like
tripods and light stands additional
lights our Pelican case that we use for
traveling one of the cases Oh bacon Kino
Flo lights are in there now YouTube bad
god I don't really use anymore some
boxes for random junk but we have this
is our blimp we've actually only used it
once but it was pretty handy it's for
reducing wind noise when you're filming
I've been looking for this I could only
find one of them
that explains it okay well it was put
away exactly where it's supposed to in
order everything's okay yeah I could
have asked you I guess there's a random
ass on the ground where we charge our
batteries and I think that pretty much
does it this has been our room tour of
the of the editing room where three of
us work and then slick gets his own room
