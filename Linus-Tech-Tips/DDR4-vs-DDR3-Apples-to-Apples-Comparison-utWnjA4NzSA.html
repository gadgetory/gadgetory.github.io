efficient it's a requirement if you want
to pick up a fancy new CPU that needs it
and you can learn all about it here so
with ddr4 available why would you want
ddr3 anymore on top of all the other
stuff that I just said ddr4 has four in
it that's like one more than ddr3 the
answer is cost at the time of making
this video ddr4 is more expensive for a
given capacity than ddr3 so for that
reason many potential customers will
want to see it justify its higher cost
so welcome to our apples-to-apples
comparison of ddr3 and ddr4 Coolermaster
v-series semi modular power supplies
feature 80 plus gold efficiency and
their gold guarantee five-year warranty
click now to learn more so let's
introduce our test platform shall we
there are no CPUs on the market that
support both ddr3 and ddr4 at least
consumer ones so we have to be pretty
careful to reduce variables and make
this comparison as fair as possible it
starts with the processor so we chose
two CPUs based on the scene Haswell
microarchitecture from Intel the core i7
4790k and the core i7 5820k then we
proceeded to disable two of the course
on the 5820k and clock them both at
straight 4.4 gigahertz with no turbo
boost
so neither of them would have any raw
clock speed advantage one thing we
couldn't do anything about is the
difference in cache size but this is as
close as we could get to a level playing
field for the CPU next up is
motherboards we've got two gigabyte
gaming 5 motherboards the z97
X gaming 5 and the X 99 gaming 5 we were
looking for feature equivalent boards to
use for both chips and both of these
have a very similar loadout with SATA
Express 10 Gigabit M got to drive
support amplified onboard audio
welcome killer networking similar CPU
power designs with gigabytes all digital
implementation and of course a sexy
matte black and red color scheme that I
find myself carrying about probably far
too much the x99 version does have some
extras to go along with its higher price
a more advanced sound processor 3 and 4
Way SLI support and some LED lighting
accents including on the heatsink and
the i/o shield to make it easier to plug
things in in the dark but enough about
that you guys want to know about the
memory we're using right representing
ddr3 at up to the highest J deck speed
21 33 megahertz with enhanced timings
we've got a 16 gig dual channel kit of
XP GV one memory we resplendent in an
anodized red finish and representing
ddr4 at up to the highest J deck ddr4
speed 2400 megahertz
although higher speeds will be coming a
16 gig quad channel kit of a data's new
ddr4 XP gz1 series with an updated
aggressive looking heat spreader also
featuring an anodized red finish so huge
thanks to a data for providing us with
these modules for testing even the brand
new ddr4 modules operated flawlessly
throughout the benchmarking process and
for that matter so did the motherboards
I'm really impressed especially with the
x99 gaming 5 this one has made a lot of
progress gigabytes drop in BIOS updates
like that and the stability of it is
much much improved over x99 at launch so
yeah everything just kind of went
smoothly for a change anyway speaking of
the benchmarking process I guess that's
what's next so I'm gonna show you three
different scenarios here first is ddr3
dual channel next is the EDR for dual
channel so we have a very direct apples
to apples comparison between the two
memory technologies at a variety of
speeds and timings and finally to show a
very best case scenario for modern ddr4
I threw in a set of results with the RAM
overclocked to 3 gigahertz in
quad-channel mode the configuration that
most folks running ddr4
people processors will be running until
Broadwell comes to the mainstream
desktop in dual channel only sometime
next year
now synthetic benchmarks are where ddr4
should be able to really flex its
muscles these I 264 benches are designed
to show us the upper most limits of the
theoretical performance of the memory
subsystem of a PC in our
apples-to-apples test ddr4 delivers
better performance in Reed's than ddr3
but actually worse right and latency
results making this a bit of a wash but
in its full quad channel configuration
our high speed ddr4 is untouchable here
next up is real-world non-gaming results
multi-threaded rendering and our 7-zip
compression and decompression benchmarks
are a good way to show off the
performance of modern CPUs with lots of
processing course and high-speed memory
is needed to keep all of those cores fed
so something to note here is that while
the performance scaling with better
memory might not look very impressive
the LGA 2011 3 socket is likely to be
with us for a few years and has CPUs
available for it already with up to 18
course so while the extra bandwidth even
in quad-channel
isn't needed for this artificial quad
core that we created here there are ways
to kid out a board like this so that
it's much more likely that that extra
memory bandwidth would be used which
leads to our final set of benchmarks
games I only ended up running a couple
of games the canned benchmark in Tomb
Raider at these settings and my custom
run at the end of BioShock Infinite at
these settings because the results here
don't leave much for me to interpret
even going all the way down to ddr3 1333
megahertz so nearly the launch speed of
ddr3 in dual-channel i couldn't create a
situation where game performance was
limited in any meaningful way by the
memory subsystem on it as well based cpu
with only four cores so in conclusion
while it might be worthwhile from a
platform point of view to invest in ddr4
for your six core or eight core
processor since you don't really have a
choice if you want the latest CPUs
if you're a normal consumer who doesn't
really need the extra course it looks
like LGA 1150 with its ancient ddr3
memory still has a lot of life left in
it and given how unconstrained our
Haswell CPUs are even by very low speed
ddr3 I think it's safe to say that the
performance improvements we can expect
to see from Intel's upcoming Broadwell
desktop processors will be thanks to
architectural improvements not the use
of ddr4 guys like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment letting me know what you
thought were you expecting ddr4 and an
apples to apples comparison to run away
with it or were you expecting exactly
