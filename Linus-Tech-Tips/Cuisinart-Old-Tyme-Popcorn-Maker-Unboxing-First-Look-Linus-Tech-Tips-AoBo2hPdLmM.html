maybe doesn't belong on Linus tech tips
youtube channel maybe it doesn't but the
legendary cameraman himself for reasons
that I'm not gonna get into here has
asked me has asked me very nicely to
unbox the Cuisinart theater-style
popcorn maker which incidentally is
available at NCI XCOM yes it is a
theater style popcorn maker so it's got
the red look it's got the glass going on
it's got the popcorn bin going on here
it's got the water Ernest okay here
let's just open it up 300 watts of power
makes up to 8 cups of fresh popcorn
pivoting kettle and magnetized already
attached for easy cleanup that's a good
thing removable serving tray is fun to
serve ok limited three-year warranty
there any what else we got here classic
look that I definitely get optimum
results what else do they have to say
for themselves on here that's not in
French serving tray okay let's open this
up hm
inside we find some packing materials so
we're gonna go ahead and remove these
this is actually cut you know what cut
here's how I'm gonna tie it into tech
tips if you have a media PC here like a
networked media player like a theater
room you might need one of these think
that's sort of related right there's our
own piece one I do prefer to see like
more of a run a soft foam used if you
guys are regular watches in the channel
you'll know that I do prefer that
although I guess it's not the end of the
world because it doesn't really wave
much so that's that's a factor that you
guys should consider when you're
evaluating the packaging of a particular
item okay you know what we're just gonna
cut this in order to get access to the
popcorn maker here oh okay yeah where
I'm good I don't need anything from
upstairs I'm about to get locked into
the building so uh that was that was
that that small interruption there sorry
about that guys here we go oh I get it
hold on yeah no I get it I get it haha
paper protectiveness on the top here and
then we open it up to find the theater
style popcorn maker itself and I gotta
say it is even more hilarious looking in
person than it is on the picture on the
front of the box I would have loved if
it was like a more metal construction
but it is completely plastic
construction this doesn't seem to come
off okay we've got the pop and off so
operation seems fairly simple if you
either want it to be off or you want it
to pop this door is magnetized pops up
to 8 cups of blah blah okay so that's
the same things we saw already let's go
ahead and open that up there you go you
got a little hinge on there you got more
flips magnetized or so it doesn't open
accidentally okay inside here we find
protective peace and find a an
instruction booklet let's see what's in
the instruction booklet I'm just curious
oh look at that it just comes right off
so you can I can easily clean it I
wouldn't have done this if the cameraman
didn't ask me to you guys okay so plug
the thing into the thing pretty much
power cord its power cord instruction
well whole page for that save these
what else we got here
assembly procedure okay so place the
door on the hinges it came with the door
on the hinges but that's okay we'll let
it go figure to hook the kettle on to
the hanger of the main unit figure three
insert the tray finally insert the
internal kettle plug into the socket of
the inner top of the popcorn housing so
let's go ahead I'm not gonna you know
what I'm not gonna get too much further
into this you guys I'm just gonna sort
of show you so here is the hanger unit
itself here's the power cord up here is
where it plugs into here's a little
light inside so it's it's lit on the
inside so it'll look all bright and
cheery and this right here this white
piece is the actual tray so it's fairly
straightforward thank you for checking
