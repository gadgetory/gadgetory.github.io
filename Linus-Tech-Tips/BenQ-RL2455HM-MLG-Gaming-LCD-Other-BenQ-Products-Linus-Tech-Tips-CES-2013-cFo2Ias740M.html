now we're seeing a couple things we've
seen from Ben Q before there's some
projectors some monitors but this is
something that's a little different now
Ben Q has had interactive projectors for
over a year now this you know you can
sell that kind of thing to a school or
business where they want to make
presentations they want to be able to to
gesture at the screen or you know write
on it or whatever else this is an
interactive TV it uses a very
sophisticated system involving two
cameras and an infrared sensor
technology to make the touchscreen
incredibly accurate now's both slick and
I we're playing around with it before we
shot the video and both of us noticed
how easy it is to hit the correct action
on the screen even when you're off to at
an angle which can be a problem on TVs
because of the thickness of the glass
and the fact that the LCD panel is
actually behind the glass so even while
I'm off to the side I'm not gonna miss
that black box when I try to write on it
you can also see there's almost up there
made one mistake there's almost no delay
as I write on it and it is very very
accurate so part of the problem right
there is I'm wishing on it really really
hard so if I sort of touch it more in
the way that I would normally touch a
touchscreen there you go we can get
quite smooth lines so this is meant for
more like the same kind of audience as
the interactive projector maybe a
classroom or something like that but
where they don't necessarily have the
room to mount the projector or they
don't want to worry about being standing
in front of the light beam and it
causing the yeah the actual screen
itself to go black as a shadow behind
them now this is something we've seen
from BenQ before beastly projectors so
they're saying their customers are
demanding higher brightness projectors
so for something like a boardroom where
you don't you're not really able to dim
the lights properly this guy right here
has all kinds of sweet awesome inputs
including dual HDMI they're also adding
3d to their business class projectors
which is I suppose entirely necessary
because you never know when you're going
to want to give a presentation in a
board meeting in 3d but the main thing
about this guy is the 4000 lumens
brightness now okay so that's not a
general consumer skill but BenQ does
have general consumer skills as well
there have also introduced this new
merchandising scheme they wanted us to
show it off at CES
so rather than relying on the sales rep
in your local big-box store who you're
gonna ask them a question which one's 3d
which one's got the best brightness and
they're gonna kind of look at you like
oh and they're gonna like look at the at
the label under the product and see if
they can see it on there cuz they don't
know so the idea is to put everything
about the projector on an easy-to-read
format on the top of it as a sticker you
just remove it when you get it home and
that's gonna roll out to all the
projectors not just that particular
model we're looking at now Ben Q already
has the MLG official PC gaming monitor
under their belt now they're adding the
RL 2 4 5 5 hm
this is oriented more towards the
console gamers now you still have those
features that were available on the PC
version that is to say you have the FPS
mode the RTS mode black equalizer which
is designed to take details that are
hidden in shadows or hidden in dark
areas of a map and make them pop out a
little bit more not something that'd be
ideal for photo editing for example guys
but if you're looking for every
competitive edge that's there it has a 1
millisecond greater gray response time
which is about as fast as it gets and to
appeal more to the console guys maybe
you don't have a lot of space maybe your
our PC and a console guy it has dual
HDMI inputs so you can either have a PC
on the right of it and a console on the
left or if you don't you have a laptop
you don't have a PC you can have your
ps3 and your Xbox 360 perked up to it at
the same time without ever having to
swap any cables so this is now their
second official gaming monitor of major
league gaming and I think they're very
very proud of it and that's why they
have it here at the show today now I've
talked about the W 1070 already but this
is a short throw version of it basically
the only things that have changed are
the optics so it now is able to project
a 100 inch image which is over there in
at less than a 6 feet throw distance
this is the first short throw 1080p 3d
projector on the market and it's going
to be available sometime in Feb
so just to make the point of how here
I'm just gonna take this with me just to
make the point of how short the distance
we're throwing here is we can go sort
out here let's let's go by Linus arm
length so that's one two three and a
half Linus arm lengths and the actual
throw distance that we have from the
projector to the TV is just over one
Linus body length in fact about five
foot six inches according to what what I
think it converts into a regular sort of
measurement so this is really awkward
we're gonna move on to the next thing
now kiss design you probably haven't
heard of it before that's because it's
new to North America this is a wholly
owned subsidiary of BenQ so they're
getting into house lighting now I'm
gonna start with how much these things
cost this is two thousand dollars this
is a thousand dollars and this one right
here on the table is six hundred dollars
so guys this is not meant to replace
light bulbs this is more of a fashion
statement it's intended for a luxury
home where you're it's not I mean it
doesn't even throw that much light it's
more of an artistic piece you're
expected to actually already have
lighting in the room so what's cool
about this one and all of them is
they're LED lighting I'm gonna move over
here so that slick can sort of survive
over there you can actually change which
ones are on and which ones are off just
by flipping the switch around so the
bottom is metal the top are sort of
these semi translucent plastic panels
and you can put it in sort of a pattern
it looks kind of like a piano so that's
why it's called the piano led floor
thank you tried really hard to have this
all perfect so now I've got a messed it
up for them so I'm sorry guys this right
here is the seagull so at a thousand
dollars each you can control how much
light on the front knob it emits just
like that and you can actually control
the positioning of the wing so I told
them I probably need an entire flock of
these from my kitchen and I was offered
sort of a very compelling discount of I
think it was 873 99 each so I said there
you go if it's the kind of thing where
you want to make a statement with the
lighting in your home not necessarily a
bad idea
personally I don't spend much time in
high-end lighting stores but my
understanding is these prices actually
aren't that crazy once you get into that
kind of a product this guy right here is
the coral LED table
this one's to me actually the most
appealing out of them because unlike the
others which seem like this there
they're bright enough to actually throw
light this really is just kind of a
stand you've never used this to read by
it's just kind of unique looking it's
available in a variety of colors and we
have one more thing Ben Q wanted me to
mention this they have one at him a CES
design and engineering showcase award
presented Zhu Ben Q for this monitor
right here this is the VW 2430 H so it's
a white monitor it is optimized for
Apple users so that is to say you buy
your MacBook you buy your your Apple
desktop it has a built in profile where
it's an apple mode that tries to
simulate the way that the colors appear
on the display of your Apple computer so
basically they're just trying to make it
so that you have a more uniform
experience this isn't anything that you
couldn't do on your own with a color
calibrator or by eyeballing it for long
enough but out of the box it is intended
to appeal to an Apple user it also has a
built in business card holder you can't
miss this diesel check this out it
rotates holds business cards don't miss
