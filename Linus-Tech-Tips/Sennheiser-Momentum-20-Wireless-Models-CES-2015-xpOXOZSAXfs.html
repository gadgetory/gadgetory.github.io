brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors here at
Sennheiser they're celebrating 70 years
with some pretty interesting products
some of them are small refreshes so this
is the momentum on-ear 2.0 basically the
only changes is that now that
lightweight metal band design folds
bippity boop just like that that is
about it other than that same materials
same drivers same everything the
momentum on-ear 2.0 actually has a
couple of more changes so this one does
fold but also gets an upgrade to the
earcup material as well as the ear cup
size so folks who were complaining that
with the old momentum over ear they felt
more like an on-ear cuz it pressed down
against their earlobes that shouldn't be
it nearly as much of an issue anymore
now both of these haven't changed in
terms of pricing so it's 229 for the on
ear and 349 for the over ear but where
they really shook things up is right
here now this looks just like a regular
urbanite excel in fact if i were to tell
you that it was one you probably
wouldn't know any differently because
the urbanite XL has a detachable cable
and in fact this one does too but now
it's wireless so for another 50 bucks
over the regular urbanite XL you get
wireless functionality it's bluetooth I
actually don't have a quoted battery
life for this one but this one does
about 15 hours battery life so you're
gonna get that same ruggedness and
durability that same fold ability and
travel ability that same sound signature
however it is that you personally feel
about that now with wireless bluetooth
4.0 all that good stuff and that one's
$300 and then wow I just dropped a $500
pair of headphones in front of Zen
Heiser and I'm getting the nervous
laughter over there Wow so this is the
momentum over ear Wireless I just
mentioned the price there $500 they
haven't changed the acoustic quality
compared to the momentum over here is
extremely well regarded but what they
have done is they've given it the
momentum 2.0 treatment so you've got
those nice thick nice larger ear
cushions on it it does still fold just
like that it charges via micro USB
but this one and aside from just plain
sounding better than the urbanite XL no
offense if you really like your urbanite
excel has some really cool technology
inside so you get 22 hours of playback
or 2 weeks of standby and you get 5
microphones it's like yeah you're buying
2 speakers and five microphones so one
of them is for voice yes you can hold a
conversation with them four of them are
for noise cancellation so active noise
cancellation on this bad boy we tried it
out here on the show floor actually the
only audio thing that makes any sense to
try on a show floor pretty impressive so
far compared to the QC 15s which are the
only other really well-regarded active
noise cancellation headphones that I've
personally tried I get less of that
feeling of pressure on my ears but I'd
need to spend quite a bit more time with
them to really give you guys my thoughts
I forget where I was really going with
that right so active noise cancellation
this is something I haven't really seen
much of from Sennheiser in the past
controls are over here on the back of
the right ear cup so you've got your
power as well as volume a volume up and
down slider that you press in order to
play or pause and then finally there's
your microUSB as well as you can still
wire them up should you so desire but if
you're gonna go and pay $500 for a ball
and wireless headphones you're probably
gonna use them wirelessly mostly unless
your battery runs out of course so that
is pretty much it for the momentum and
urbanite updates guys hope you enjoy all
of our show coverage I want to take a
little bit of time to thank our sponsors
so these guys you know the guys that let
me take my phone and like do this with
it and like rub it all over everything
and not care even though it's an iPhone
6 yeah that corner right there I'm
getting a little I'm getting to look
from these guys over here they're like

glass screen protector these guys make
awesome screen protectors for me to
