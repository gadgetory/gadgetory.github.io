unboxings over the next little while
here I've actually got an entire new
lineup of CPU coolers from silent X so
this is there a physio lineup i've got
the compact which comes in a blue box i
have the extreme which comes in a green
box i have the performance which comes
in a grey box and i have the low profile
which comes in a red box so the very
first one that i'm going to do is going
to be the compact and the reason i'm
going to do the compact first is
completely arbitrary I like the blue
color because i am wearing a blue shirt
today so this is the quietest noise
level heatsink so that means it falls
under there less than 18 decibel rated
heatsink category you can see that we
have to six millimeter heat pipes that
are heat pipe direct touch so they
direct the interface with the processor
core that means that you get slightly
better thermal performance but it is
more expensive to manufacture a heatsink
that has the heat pipes directly
contacting the cpu core with optimized
fan late for the greatest air to noise
ratio so they're using silent X fans
which they well should because this is a
silent X heatsink and next yeah that
they have a new universal mounting
system so that's going to be a big one
that we're going to look closely at is
how solid is the new universal mounting
system so here's the compatibility as
well as the specifications i'll let you
have a close look at those so you can
see the weight is actually quite low
which i would expect for a low profile
here rather for a compact heatsink
because you don't want a compact
heatsink that weighs a ton you've got
the ratings for the fan on there as well
so let's go ahead and open up the box
and have a look at what we find inside
so the first thing that I'm going to
notice here is that it is very compact
this is a small heat sink so that means
that you can use it in a case that is
very slim because it's not going to sit
very far away from the motherboard and
you can also use it in a case where
there's you've got a fair bit of
clearance from the cpu socket upward but
you don't need a ton because it does use
an 80 millimeter fan so let's go ahead
and have a look at the back plate for
their new universal mounting system
alright so we got holes on here that's
nice and solid you can see they've
actually shaped it as well see this
even here so they've shaped it in order
to give it a little bit more structural
rigidity and you can see that they've
got a plastic coating on the back here
so I can't actually put my finger into
that groove so that's to keep it non
conductive when it's plastered to the
back of a motherboard so we've got 775
1156 1366 holes am two and three holes k
eight holes you've got holes for pretty
much everything make a hole in it to
mount it to all right next we have a cpu
fan speed controller that's a pretty
good value for a lo ng think we don't
usually expect to see that and this is a
value heatsink I mean you're not going
to be shattering any performance
barriers with this one that's not the
point of this product okay so in here we
have our AMD k 8 am-2 a.m. 2 plus am
three mounting hardware so you can see
we've got a little adapter here that we
basically bolt on to the cooler and then
we use the included screws to screw it
down ok I love that all of the melting
hardware here is made out of solid metal
pieces there isn't a single plastic
piece of mounting hardware in this
entire kit so we've got ok yeah we've
got rubber grommets to mount the fan if
we want noiseless fan mounting but
that's it and that's perfectly
acceptable other than that we have bolt
through ok we have thumb screws with
spring mounting so those are things that
I really like to see and then we have
like no plastic nonsense now we've got
some included thermal compound this is
silent ex Brandon will compute greater
than thirty percent silver content by
volume so that's a silver based thermal
compound here's our included fan speed
controller I've seen these in a number
of different heat sink solutions so
there's probably some OEM somewhere that
makes these they work really good they
have a hole in here because there's a
little heat sink down there gives it
some ventilation for the heat that it's
going to kick off its not very much
though so you just plug this into your
motherboard you plug this into the fan
and then you control the fence because
fairly straightforward ah but i'll
probably do is plug this into my test
bank just sitting over there and then we
can hear how loud the fam is now this
isn't a typical looking silo next time
is expecting to see one of their silvery
looking fans but I guess that's fine oh
cool that's nice so they actually
include extra rubber mounts because you
can see the rubber mounts on here are
already attached to a fan so that means
you can actually set this up as a
sandwich this is kind of a neat design i
haven't seen something like this from
cylonix before so first let's have a
look at our three pins and connector
right here that's it that's all there
really is to say about it is three pins
it's fan the fan is black and white and
you can see it's actually mounted with a
bit of a gap here so the way that these
that these rubber grommets work is they
actually slide into the heatsink right
here and then you just push the fan onto
it and pull them through that's actually
pretty clever I like it so you've got
your two heat pipes now this isn't gonna
be like I said it's not a
high-performance product so you've only
got 26 mil heat pipes but you do have a
quite a flat finish to the base it's all
machine very very nicely and i'll do the
obligatory finger shop thing here which
doesn't actually tell us anything but
everybody does it so I guess I might as
well so you got your Universal hold down
on here ok actually oh yeah oh yeah this
is universal so the AMD clips go on to
these holes and then they extend extend
it a little bit and then these are the
Intel holes okay so you've got a little
heat sink built right over on to the
heat pipes so that's going to dissipate
a little bit of heat but it's not going
to get a ton of airflow even if you're
running like a push-pull set up with the
fan and then I really like the way
they've laid out these heat these are
heat sink fins so what they've done is
they've actually built in like kind of a
a different shape to every alternate fin
so that gives you a bit of a um I don't
know how to describe this but the way it
looks to me is like what they're aiming
for is more of a streamlined entrance
for the air that's going through where
most of the air goes through which is
directly under the fan blades so you can
see right under the fan blades that's
where you have this intersection where
some of the fins are shaped out in a
bulbs like this and some of them are
shaped in an hourglass shape in like
that so that's that looks like it's by
design it's quite a dense fin
arrangement so what you're probably
going to want to do is invest another
three dollars and get a cheap fan or you
can invest a little bit
more and get a nice silent fan throw
that on the other side you should have a
nice performing little cooler for
relatively inexpensive cost so thank you

oficio compact heatsink and don't forget
