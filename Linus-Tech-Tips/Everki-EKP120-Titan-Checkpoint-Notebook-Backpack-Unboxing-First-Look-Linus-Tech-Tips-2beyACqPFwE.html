over key Titan II KP 120 and this is a
larger a larger notebook carrying bag
for good for up to eighteen point five
inch notebooks or something like that if
I recall correctly eighteen point four
inch sorry my bad well I'm sure if you
you know forced it you could probably
get an eighteen point five inch bag in
laptop in there so I've actually
recently switched over to using it a
virtue bag this is the last one that I
unboxed which has the carrying strap
here the huge compartment here is the
underlined console carrying case that I
use to actually store my camera and
accessory in it because it's nice and
soft and padded so overall very
satisfied the straps are extremely
durable and you can see they're just
like totally over built but we're not
going to focus on that bag for this
video we're going to focus on this one
so starting with their documentation
let's see the number all the features
checkpoint friendly this is this is kind
of hilarious because checkpoint friendly
evidently means you can take the whole
bag zip it down to the very bottom past
the very bottom like this yes checkpoint
friendly all I think they mean by
checkpoint friendly they mean like
airport friendly okay so you take the
whole bag and you go like this which
means that your laptop is now in a
completely segregated pocket so when
you're going through airport security
they can scan just the laptop because
they always ask you to have that in a
separate in a separate bin and then you
can leave all the rest of the stuff here
so that's actually a really cool feature
that now that I figured out what it's
for on camera when I was trying to
figure it out for like two minutes
before this makes a ton of sense so
that's very very cool so there's that
and then you can also strap in your
notebook just like that so holds up to
an eighteen point four inch laptop this
is a 15.6 inch laptop so you can clearly
see there's quite a bit of extra space
but because of the padded nature of the
pocket quite thick padding as well as
the faux fur lining it's not going to
scratch it's not going to bounce around
in a way that's going to be harmful
you've got a fair bit of padding on the
bottom probably about this much padding
on the ball
so as long as you don't like throw your
bag anywhere you're not going to be
running into too much trouble with that
so let's go ahead and close this pocket
back actually no let's not close this
pocket so the whole point of this is the
checkpoint friendliness right so let's
keep going here so the next thing we've
got is a dedicated media player pouch
right there once again
faux fur line so nothing's going to get
scratched or anything like that got
enough space for whatever you want to
put in out and say maybe your iPhone or
whatever else okay then you've got one
of those one of those headphone cord
holes which is a slightly
water-resistant because it's rubberized
and you can see they all come together
but I wouldn't rely on that for a
completely waterproof seal just throwing
that out there guys do be careful
what are these okay so we got like some
flippy things going on here let's get
let's get to those after these are
covered in neoprene which is once again
a high quality material that's one of
the things that really impresses me
about these of our key bags so far I've
only seen two of them the one that I'm
using in this one but that the overall
materials that they choose seem to be a
very very high quality all right okay so
we will take those off now let's open up
the next pouch one of the few complaints
I have about the bag that I have now is
not enough segmentation inside it to
really organize your things so looking
at this one this seems to address all
the problems that I have with the
current bag just by using a slightly
bigger one so this guy has tons of
little compartments you got little
compartment here little compartment here
you've got another bigger compartment
here you've got ones that zipper off oh
this is neat what's this oh this is the
bag that Oh check this out this is like
way bigger than it looked
oh that's like the most amazing thing
I've ever seen okay check this out check
this okay hold on okay so it looks this
big but then I find some like jump to
pile in it hold on here let's let's
unclip it okay here here so we can put
like a gaming mouse in it and put like
another gaming mouse in it and then we
could like roll up a gaming mouse pad
and we could like put that in it
and then because it expands in the back
due to the way they've done the seams it
actually gets significantly bigger than
it initially looked so that's kind of
cool yet another way and this once again
addresses my one issue with the one that
I'm using now not enough segmentation
all of a sudden this is my tool bag and
then I can fill my tool bag into the
bottom of the bag where there's a little
space for it see that and not worry
about any of that stuff scratching up
any of my other stuff these guys also
have these smart scenes look at this I'm
gonna call them smart seems even though
a ver key doesn't have a name for them
so they make the pockets slightly bigger
than they actually appear okay so that's
neat you got a cat I wonder if you can
put a cat in the bag
there you go
he likes it we're testing the durability
and ruggedness of the avera key bang
okay so moving on here at the front of
the bag we have yet another
compartmentalized
thing going on here lots and lots of
different pockets love bags with lots of
pockets that's like a personal thing bet
that I like quite a lot especially bags
that you can hold a cat in the although
the cats out of the bag now hahahaha I
was waiting to make that joke okay so
we've got a little little pocket thing
here that doesn't look all that safe I
probably wouldn't keep anything too
important in there but you know
something you want to be able to access
really easily that's maybe oh you know
what I think they thought of this
because as long as it's something that
can be held in by this strap oh this is
oh I know what it is this is the tablet
thing because I read the features but I
didn't know where any of them work so
you can keep your tablet here I don't
know that that's the best idea if you're
not using like some kind of a protective
case like my iPad I have a protective
case on but oops there goes my zero
punctuation that I was watching on my on
my Galaxy Tab because it doesn't work on
the iPad because the escapists doesn't
support ipad right now so yeah
everything's very soft and non scratchy
there so there you go I found the tablet
bag container thing let's see what's in
here
ah the weatherproof well not
weatherproof the weather resistant cover
so I'm not going to take the whole thing
out this is kind of a twelve okay I'll
get that will do so basically you just
take this thing and you cover the bag
with it when you're going to be riding
in the rain or walking in the rain and
it should keep everything inside
reasonably safer than it would be if you
didn't use it at all
more pockets more segmentation and that
is here here here
hens other random stuff see these kinds
of pockets I don't find as useful the
other one has more of these just because
you can't really put that much in them
whereas the ones in here are awesome
because they're like huge like awesome
okay so now I think that leaves us just
with the ones on the side where once
again we find more segmentation so we
got here we got here and then let's flip
it around so to answer the question how
much tech crap there we go
some pens some other pockets and one
more mesh pocket in there how much tech
crap can you hold in here I think we can
all agree that the answer is a heck of a
lot and slick is pointing something out
to me that I don't really know what it's
for so we're just going to cut for a
second here oh it's to hold the water
bottle there you go so that's what this
is for it holds a water bottle if it
sticks out to the top oh that's actually
kind of neat and smart okay let's see if
we missed anything so we're gonna go
through their documentation to see what
they think of it now okay oh we haven't
talked about the straps at all yet
although I did show you guys the straps
on my other of our tea bag which I'm
quite pleased with so my assumption is
that they're going to be quite similar
but I will show you guys before we wrap
this up here lifetime warranty that's
always good to have brand story
innovation is the result of challenging
the mind to overcome the obstacles so
the designs to use this mentality to
constantly employ new and unique ideas
in the creation of our products they
really do actually because I've had a
lot of backpacks in my life because I'm
more of a backpack guy than a briefcase
guy and okay I don't know that this
documentation is particularly useful but
whatever but they're good at making the
backpack in the first place even if
their little brochure isn't that
fantastic
so the water-resistant weather cover the
clever buckle system provides additional
support when the backpack is fully
loaded will show you that it's a
five-point system soft fur felt line
checkpoint friendly five-point balance
strap evenly distributes weight yep
okay aero flow padded back and shoulder
straps okay
so let's show you that show you the
padding and the shoulder straps so oh
wow it has very very thick padding so
this is probably about this much padding
actually between the notebook itself
between the notebook padding that's on
side and the back patting that's on this
side and that's at the bottom and on
both sides as well as on the straps
themselves so it's very very padded
we've also got not only the yeah okay so
here let's see where this strap goes so
I'm gonna have to do this up a little
bit here guys sorry my tablet got my
notebook since I'm actually loading it
up with a fair amount of weight I should
be able to give you guys some idea how
it does in terms of support oops okay
little bit tough to to reassemble once
you I'm checkpoint it but still less
work than taking your notebook out of
your bag entirely so I think mission
accomplished on that one there we go
okay so let's go ahead and throw it on
oh this is alright so this is for extra
support so that it distributes the
weight more more evenly because when you
have something out here that hangs off
the top of your shoulders that's where
the weights going to hang so what
they've done here is they've allowed you
to tighten it in so that it hangs off of
the small of your back instead of
directly off your shoulders that's
actually really smart and wouldn't have
made a huge difference on one of the one
of the trips I went on recently to CES
where I was carrying around a backpack
with my notebook in it all day okay so
where have they position the strap so
they've got the chest strap going on
here not bad actually it's a little on
the big side because I only have a 15
inch notebook and I'm quite short I'm
only about 5 6 but if you're a little
bit taller than me it probably won't
look quite as big on you so you go I
guess I'll do my little turn on the
catwalk uh and I think that's pretty
much it thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the emerging
