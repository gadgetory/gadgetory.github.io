to you by the Corsair one and synergy
check them out at the link in the video
description for my initial plan for the
gigabyte suite was pretty
straightforward drop by
check out the X $2.99 board and then
GTFO then I saw this thing this is not
the finished GT x 1080 gaming notebook
that's here at the show both a soos and
Acer actually have thinner ones but
gigabytes approach to in videos max-q
design technology that they announced
here in my opinion is a little bit
better balanced so yes inside this
device is a fully fledged gtx 1088 gig
gddr5 x overclockable graphics card and
while you might not be that impressed
because it is about a half a centimeter
thicker maybe Seuss's design in my
opinion they've made you were gross
trade-off than both of the other guys
with a touchpad that's in a normal
location and a massive 94 watt hour
battery not to mention that the rest of
the specs are looking pretty ball to the
wall as well it's got a great mix of i/o
with support for up to three external 4k
displays it's got four full-size USB
ports in addition to a type C and a
Thunderbolt 3 port it's got HDMI out
it's got an SD card reader and hard line
networking making it suitable for
workstation use and that's not all that
makes it suitable for workstation use
the 4k display might not be high refresh
rate which I would prefer but it's
Pantone certified it's got a number pad
it's got programmable macro keys and the
whole keyboard is RGB backlit with a
nice feeling touchpad that I wish with a
little bit more responsive feeling but
these are small complaints because when
you open this thing up it has absolutely
got it where it counts to go along with
the overclockable graphics card they've
got an overclockable core i7 78 20 HK
quad core up to 64 gigabytes of ddr4
memory and you can even swap them
yourself because they're sodium based
they've got 2 m dot 2 slots with support
for
zero in addition to may two and a half
inch drive bay and they're rocking a
massive 94 watt hour battery so that
extra half a centimeter is really being
put to good use
now you aren't going to get this for
cheap it's going to cost over three
thousand US dollars but so far this is
looking like the best balanced thin GT X
1080 notebook that I've seen it might
seem a little pudgy but you got this
little kickstand thing to get a little
bit of extra cooling but in my opinion
it actually feels less flimsy than a
Seuss's vent that opens up when you flip
open the display so thanks for watching
and a huge share of this energy for
allowing us to be here at the show their
software which you can save 25% on it
the link in the video description lets
you share a mouse on the keyboard across
multiple pcs even cross-platform and
took course fare who's Corsair one small
form-factor gaming pc looks and performs
a freaking fantastic you can check that
out down below as well don't forget to
subscribe so you don't miss any of our
time to get coverage and I will see you
guys at the next terrifying skyscraper
