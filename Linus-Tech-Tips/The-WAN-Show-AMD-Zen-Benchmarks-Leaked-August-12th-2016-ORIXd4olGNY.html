broadcasting that's fine you can keep
doing what you're doing
Terran apparently thinks building Lego
crap at work is his work or whatever
Lego look I got you know brain brain
hurricane or whatever it is
see I knew he can't resist it he has to
correct me brain for even though even
though he knows like he absolutely knows
on every possible level that I'm doing
it on purpose he can't resist brew face
he has that he has to correct me so wait
so sorry hold on a second is Lego
Mindstorm related to mecha no see he did
it abend McKenna what the whole purpose
that time yeah of course okay and he's
leaving hey and you guys are coming on
board welcome to the win show it's gonna
be me and John here today we're gonna be
telling you about what's new in tech
we're gonna be trolling Terran and it'll
be up to you guys to decide which of
those things is better and or more
important and of course you're here to
find out why exactly it is that we're
late today okay so I would love to tell
you about that but I went and I left it
I left it over there well whatever I was
working on a video yeah actually yeah
pella do you mind grabbing that green
and black video card that's kind of next
to the inventory station sweet fellas
gonna bring it over for us oh you
haven't been introduced to pella he's
kind of shy I don't know if he's
actually gonna want to be on camera but
he works here
he does he does some ham right sometimes
sometimes sometimes okay um I got people
saying my pupils are huge it could be
all of the drugs that I took it's not
that easy to get amped up for landship
how could they tell that your pupils
were huge the the camera's not that
high-res I mean hey thank you alright so
this is what I was working on a five
thousand dollar graphics card finding
out just what makes it special so it's a
Quadro n 6000 and there's a lot of
there's a lot of discussion about these
because they're very hard to get your
hands on unless you have five thousand
dollars that you
want to trade for one of these so I've
seen people saying things all the way
from Quadros can't run games to that
Quadros run games better neither of
which are true well there's only one way
to find out and that's watching the
episode of holy Shi that's gonna be
coming pretty soon maybe I'm wrong stay
tuned to find out yeah now some of you
are probably kind of sitting here going
really was not more important than
starting the show on time and the answer
is normally no normally that would not
be more important than starting the show
on time but we ran into a bit of a
production snafu one of the videos that
was supposed to go out this weekend on
vessel the b-roll wasn't done and then
Brandon's out of office on a forced
vacation right now seriously the guy
wouldn't take his time on yeah I know so
he has let's see at seven weeks to take
all of his time off because he hasn't
booked off any and q4 is a blackout zone
mm-hmm and so so Yvonne actually just
assigned him days and she was just like
you're not coming into the office on
these days and is he going anywhere or
is he just kind of hanging out and just
not being here I suspect he's like
sitting at home dreaming of work
probably that's that's my best he's not
looking at camera gear that's my yeah
he's probably he's probably like
researching crap that he can hang in the
lighting grid or whatever the case may
be all right so let's get this show on
the road and that begins with of course
after the excuses the intro role it
Wow it's so nice having the stream work
properly the only thing that doesn't
work properly is me being here on time
so you guys should just skip the intro
and do the excuses no I already did the
excuses that's the whole point all right
let's jump right into what I personally
consider to be the big news this week so
the original article here is from WCC F
Tech when I saw this I pretty much went
bananas look at that AMD's and
engineering sample benchmarks leak out
the summit ridge CPU is apparently
faster than the Intel Core i5 4670 in
the whatever it is yes ashes of the
singularity benchmark program yes my
friends I just covered for a weird
grammatical slip-up by pretending that
the pauses were intentional it's very
convincing that's a pro tip by the way I
didn't get away with it today when I
have your job one day I'll keep that in
mind okay all right well Oh show up on
time and work hard and other thing yes
then profit question mark then profit
okay so let's let's talk about this a
little bit first of all yes I know
the source is WCC eff tech bit of a
rumour mill but sometimes they do hit on
things so bit of a rumour mill I mean
it's one of those things where a few mil
enough rumors eventually you will end up
with a loaf of truth I was just about to
say loaf of truth bread right my mind
perfect perfect so you got synergy today
all right and there are things that you
can consider there are things that you
can do to sort of vet a particular rumor
so one of them is you can kind of go
okay does that what's the evidence so
the evidence here is not a leak from AMD
it's a leak from a benchmark database so
that
that can be credible or it can be non
credible because some benchmarks it's
just a matter of like editing a text
string somewhere and you can make a
product show up as though it is
something else whereas other benchmarks
especially ones where the publisher in
particular wouldn't really have any
reason to any reason to act like it's
something that it's not um this this can
be an excellent way of figuring out that
yes that is indeed pretty credible so
for example a leaked CPU said screenshot
maybe I wouldn't put too much stock in
it can you probably don't cpu-z
a validated CPU said screenshot where
the processor ID shows up as Intel
engineering sample whatever whatever
code name usually those are pretty
credible ok number two is timing timing
is huge so AMD is figuring like the the
old quote if I recall correctly you'll
have to forgive me AMD has changed the
story a number of times on this but the
old quote was that they would ship Xen
in late 2016 we are now getting towards
well we're well into the second half of
2016 however they did say that it
slipped and should be shipping sometime
in early 2017 the timing for this leak
is perfect because don't imagine for a
second that a motherboard maker remember
this is a new CPU and a new chipset this
isn't a micro code update for existing
motherboards and chipsets because this
isn't like what five years old make no
sense at this point exactly we are
getting a new socket socket a.m. for we
are getting a new chipset with support
for ddr4 finally support for PCI Express
3.0 finally I mean I mean AMD has
shipped multiple generations of graphics
cards that support PCI Express
technology that their CPUs and
motherboards do not and even if you
aren't even if you're running like sort
of a middle-of-the-road or even a high
end GPU that's not going to saturate a
PCIe tulane it also means you can't take
advantage of life and you storage
options as well that's for winning an
older PCIe revision that's right so
basic
the timing is pretty good don't imagine
for a second that motherboard makers
don't have some of the first working
silicon in their labs so they can start
to make sure that their motherboards
work because AMD again this is a new
platform AMD cannot launch a cpu until
the motherboards are not only completed
in the design stage of things but are
actually tested and validated
mass-produced packaged and shipped
otherwise emails will just hang the CPUs
on your Christmas tree with that said ok
that's kind of a funny funny thing AMD
has done that before they have launched
CPUs before the motherboards were
available retail yeah yeah I don't I
don't remember which one it was but
basically it was it wasn't a huge delay
it was like a couple of days but like
the CPUs were in stock you could build
some hype that way I guess it almost
like pre-ordering a game I guess so
pre-ordering a game except it's a game
that you also need to buy like like a
special controller for and then you have
to pay shipping on the order separately
so like Guitar Hero but to another
degree
yeah just ordering like ordering like a
guitar hero like disc library and then
not having the plastic guitar yet
exactly exactly
ok so so basically what I'm trying to
say oh yeah so consideration number
three is what kind of performance we're
seeing out of it an early leak that
indicates that Zen at $200 is going to
crap all over the 69 50 X is probably
designed by some AMD fanboy somewhere
who wants people to be hyped up about
AMD that's the doesn't have much
credibility
whereas this rumor looks pretty solid so
so the benchmarks so first of all and
this is another important disclaimer the
benchmarks are of an engineering sample
and may not be entirely representative
of the retail product with that said the
product development timelines on things
like CPUs are so long that if
motherboard manufacturers and presumably
that's that's where this ultimately came
from at some point but if motherboard
manufacturers or anyone else and has
their hands on motherboards and CPUs has
silicon that they're actually using to
validate anything it's probably pretty
far along like there are sometimes very
early chips that are clocked much much
lower than the eventual retail ones end
up being but that's earlier on in the
development process where there's still
time to like tape it out again for
example I don't think AMD is looking at
if they're going to be launching the
chip sometime in the next you know three
to six months actually okay maybe but
that would be very tight like I don't
think we're gonna see anything that's
dramatically different from what's here
maybe some tweet clock speeds maybe this
is a lower end skew hard to say it was
tested with an unnamed motherboard and
an Rx for a new graphics card and the
1080p average frame rates and ashes that
the singularity showed 258 FPS for the
Zen engineering sample compared to 65.4
on an Intel Core i7 4790 and 52.6 on a
46 70k so it's currently clocked at 2.8
gigahertz base 3.2 gigahertz boost and
the benchmarks have since been pulled
down by the source so ambe's n are you
still hyped well I mean okay so I feel
like the benchmark results are probably
so a OTS is it CPU valid all I feel like
it might be there there yeah there's
some CPU yeah so so we have a chip
that's like on like a 40 nanometer
process and I know there's like a lot
more to it than just the transistor size
but it's what Intel is currently using
as well so it's it's been such a long
time since 2011 since we've got anything
new from them is
terms of architecture or so it's also
been completely redesigned by the team
that was led by Jim Keller who has
actually since moved on to Tesla which
is sort of a shame although AMD says
that the groundwork has been laid for
not only Zen but improvements upon Zen
over the next couple of years though my
concern then if I were say for example
an AMD investor or an AMD fan would be
well gee isn't that exactly what
happened with the Athlon 64 Jim Keller
led the team that designed it and you
iterated on it after he left and then
just kind of kept iterating on it after
he left and that was sort of all we had
for the next I don't know 10 years but
sorry let's let's get this let's get
this straw pull up so I just post a
strawpoll are you guys still amped for
then let's see the results here boom 45
percent of you saying yes with nine
percent of you saying no and 45 percent
of you saying you never work so
basically in a nutshell this has not
really dampened the spirits of anyone
who was legitimately excited about Zen
in the first place and you know what I
am actually in the same camp on this
because I don't need AMD to come back
Athlon 64 style and take the performance
crown that is actually not what we need
at all because at the performance crown
level is not where Intel has been
stagnant you look back at the last three
or four generations they've given us the
39 60 X the first six core consumer but
they gave us a six core consuming okay
the generation after that they gave us a
six core consumer for a little over half
the price of the previous one and a
faster six core in the 49 60 X the year
after that they bumped the core count
and they drove pricing of six cores no
wait no that 58 20 was still a hold on
yeah 5820k it was still a six core if I
recall correctly right it just it just
has fewer PCIe lanes or some of the
other ones do that's right 28 PCI
Express lanes versus 40 so at the
enthusiast level okay we got an
eight-core we still got a cheaper six
core and we got an even cheaper six core
but with fewer PCIe lanes which quite
frankly for consumers is completely
irrelevant you can quote me on that
especially these days with the SLI
limitations that's right and then and I
mean even in the previous days when the
SLI wasn't limited but you see was doing
it anyways it's still scaled horribly so
just why exactly uh and then in the
latest generation we got a ten core at
the top range which is sort of more of a
moving the bar of the top range unless
of delivering us a ten core for what
used to be with eight matches yeah
exactly but then we still get eight and
six cores for and I think in particular
the 6800 K is a pretty compelling skew
on the enthusiast platform you get six
cores really high clock speeds and you
get overclocking and there okay it was
the same thing that we said in the
review I think I think is because the
retail is like what 350 somewhere that
ball core it's a little higher I think
so but it's not ridiculous yes yeah it's
it's do it's not $1000 yeah
$1,700 it's it's not completely
outlandish yeah so actually at the
performance crown end of things Intel
hasn't been sitting on ass to quite the
same degree with that said what they
have done is they have ramped up pricing
in the performance crown in halo tier
and the reason you can ramp up pricing
of your halo tier products is not
necessarily because there isn't a
competitor who's also releasing halo
tier products at a lower price in fact
if they both had halo tier products you
can bet that they would both be selling
a CPUs for $1000 a pop in fact it's
happened everyone likes to treat AMD
like they're these like good guys
champions of you know cheap CPUs for
consumers they are not it's about
strategy like what market segment are
you going to talk that's right you go
back far enough AMD introduced the
thousand-dollar enthusiast processor
they started this thing and people
forget that so that's not the problem
the problem is that Intel has the luxury
of holding not only the performance
crown but also the mains
dream enthusiasts segment where AMD is
only really competing in the very low
end range with their AP use and in the
desperate AMD fanboy range with their FX
CPUs that's all AMD really has
so because Intel is not putting any
pressure on their enthusiast processors
by continuing to sell us quad cores for
an entire decade an entire decade until
us a quad core is enough for the
mainstream and you know what they're
probably right but that isn't the point
of what I'm saying the point is they are
not giving us the other stuff because
they don't have to because the only one
putting pressure on the enthusiasts
making us do a cost per performance per
core value calculation on the enthusiast
chips is Intel and they're going yeah
that's how much of 6-quart costs because
if you want to spend less all you can
get to quad-core and you can argue till
you're blue in the face about AMD's six
cores and eight cores but let's get real
performance matters how many cores you
write on the side of the box doesn't
matter and intel's eight cores have
nothing to do or air and brethren AMD's
eight cores have nothing to do with
intel's eight cores they're not they're
not the same thing yeah they're not even
comparable in terms of like single
threaded and all that so no they're not
yeah yeah it's it's not even it's not
even conversations so am i amped for Zen
knowing that Zen is not necessarily
going to go toe-to-toe with the 6700 K
what's not the point is in absolutely
I'm amped exactly if Zen gives us great
performance at 200 bucks then mission
accomplished AMD will have effectively
dramatically increased their average
selling price if they can move a bunch
of new generation FX whatever it is they
end up calling them FX Zen CPUs I
actually don't know what the branding is
going to be for them but if they can
move a whack 10 of those it'll drive up
AMD's ASP s that's their average sell
price it will improve AMD's
profitability give them money to spend
on R&amp;amp;D which they have been sorely
lacking and maybe give them a shot to
come back with another punch after Zen
that really put some fresh
on Intel in the meantime giving people
who want to buy a high-performance value
computer a legitimate option because
after the $200 mark even like closer to
230 bucks position returns
yeah Intel really starts to lock you
down they kind of go okay yeah we're
gonna really start to ramp down clock
speed actually did a lot of analysis on
Intel's lineup for a video that I worked
on recently called which Intel CPU
should I buy don't worry there will be
an AMD follow up but I'm waiting for Zen
because right now the answer is a cheap
APU if you want a cheap machine that
runs an APU so I did a lot of research
and you start to get into dual course
really quickly down at the bottom of
Intel's lineup and the reality of it is
when it comes to cost of the silicon
there is no real reason that Intel
should still be shipping a dual core at
least not over $100 so I would love for
Zen to bring the fight to Intel in that
mainstream segment in a real meaningful
way in much the same way that our X 480
has been a smash hit at the 200 to 250
dollar price point even though AMD
doesn't have an answer for anything
about that it's a very similar strategy
you know because our X 480 it's not
designed they're not targeting like the
GT X 1080 they're targeting the middle
of the market and it looks like they're
gonna be doing the same thing with Zen
which makes a lot of sense I think
people are kind of tired of being
quote-unquote trapped and you know
Intel's the ecosystem because if you
want like a modern CPU they're kind of
your only option and in addition to
paying like that sort of extra you know
Intel tax if you will on just just like
you were talking about so yeah and I
mean there's more to there's more to
modern than just the CPU because I would
even make the argument that you know you
could buy used Intel hardware you could
go grab a 3770k overclock that still
really good processor great processor
and you know if you want to go back to
the enthusiast platform ones assuming
you can find a board and I talked about
this in my what CPU should I buy video
but assuming you can find a board you
can go back to something like a 39 60 X
you can get those on Amazon for like 180
200 bucks I saw them used yeah and I
haven't checked out eBay lately but like
yeah you can get like a 6 core for a
pretty good value
four o'clock that's not out of that
thing the problem is the platform so
you're gonna be missing a lot of USB 3
ports you're gonna be missing USB 3.1 10
gigabit for sure you're gonna be missing
um dot 2 you're gonna be missing things
that require BIOS level support even
though the hardware is there so
something like an nvme SSD that goes
into a PCIe slot you're not gonna have
support for that bottleneck by that by
the interface board yeah yep well not
even just that the motherboard
manufacturer has to specifically enable
it yeah they have to add BIOS support
for it and let's face it you show me a
motherboard manufacturer that cares
about their motherboards after the
product cycle is over and I will show
you an incredulous face like this I like
to say I'll put a unicorn in your
driveway yeah that's good too yeah yeah
I'll put a unicorn in your incredulous
face Wow
all right so let's see what are people
saying they're saying they have
expansion slots so it's not quite that
is a good point yeah but there's some
stuff that you will not get with an
expansion slot Thunderbolt comes to mind
vulnerable must have support at the
board level before you can add an
expansion card to it even though some
motherboards do support expansion cards
notably the rampage 5 extreme that I
have in my personal rig doesn't have it
on board but there's a header like a
data header that you can plug in this
specific expansion card and that
specifically will work native support
just seems to play more nicely with
things overall that's right so like I
know what like on the upcoming um the
the kb light from intel but it's going
to have native I think USB 3.1 perhaps
without me like an add-in chip
I think KB Lake was also gonna add a
Thunderbolt Thunderbolt 3 that best well
it might be both yeah I think you're
right actually it was one of the other
yeah it had three it I just remember
that but yeah alright so the flash
memory summit this is sort of a big deal
if you're into if you're into that kind
of thing the original article here is
from Engadget have you not been able to
load this up yet I have to factor or so
yeah just go get it okay yeah that's
fine don't worry I'm all good I'm not
good in the hood see gates new six
terabyte SSD Dwarfs others on the market
and we're talking both in terms of the
capacity and in terms of the actual
physical size now Seagate's
sixty terabyte SSD that they showed off
is not the first three and a half inch
SSD that I've ever seen in fact let's
see if I can find a picture of it the
OCZ colossus with a whopping two star
rating over on new egg dadsy a here the
OCZ colossus took a similar approach
back in home plus this like around 2013
2012 something something like that I
want to say where they just went to a
three and a half inch form factor solely
so that they could stuff more flash
chips onto a larger PCB in order to ship
a capacity that otherwise wasn't
possible the problem with the Colossus
and the reason that you're not gonna be
buying one of Seagate 60 terabyte SSDs
unless you are and like I actually have
no idea who the customers are for these
no idea video production companies maybe
no I don't think so I'm kidding
I don't think so like who needs sixty
terabytes of solid-state storage and
doesn't already have like like on a
single drive okay yeah on a single drive
with a SAS interface I mean the cheap
way the incredibly cheap response here
would be no one will ever need more than
64 KB of RAM but you making I said it
was a cheap response you make a good
point that is a cheap response now
especially the fact that it's on a
single drive over as well okay it's a
dual interface drive but over over over
just a dual SAS interface instead of
being like 60 terabytes of flash storage
in like a ginormous server that has
doodles and oodles of read and write
bandwidth and can handle hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of I ops to like
this you know ball in interface thing
anyway so the problem that they're gonna
run into is the same one as before it's
a lot of capacity it's a single
interface still so you're not really
getting a performance benefit for the
size and last but not least there is not
really a cost benefit because you still
have to buy all of those flash dies so
let's go ahead and see if we can find
the let's see where is it
blah blah blah how many how many how
many packages can't remember it was
something ridiculous and unfortunately
this version of the article doesn't have
that information there was a different
one that I was looking at when I was
just like tooling around reading about
this but wow this is great the actual
the actual marketing line for this is
reach 1 petabyte of storage with only 17
drives Wow fantastic right now it is
only a demo unit in fact we have reached
out to Seagate asking if they can get us
a unit just for like another episode of
holy or something like that cuz
this thing's gonna cost like okay if I
had to guess I'd say it's gonna cost
over $25,000 for sure probably more
depending on who exactly the target is
because the performance of it is
shockingly not that bad again this is
something that was covered in the other
article I was looking at and
unfortunately isn't in this one 4
terabytes per watt of power consumption
that's fantastic
ultra dense and Technology from micron
and uses a unique approach where Seagate
is actually still using a single
controller to access all of the NAND
flash so then they're just using what
are effectively kind of like like switch
switch technology to allow each like
each channel of the controller to access
many many many more flash ties than the
otherwise it's just like behave right
here to control where they developed or
is it something else
well see Kate's been investing very very
heavily in in flash even though they
don't actually have anything as I recall
so yeah it wouldn't surprise me and they
I mean they acquired they acquired LSI a
little while back yeah more company
seems to be getting involved in then WD
start trying to get involved with with
NAND yeah they purchased SanDisk or
maybe you know I think that happened I
remember hearing about it that could be
wrong
it's an ocean maybe 12 2016 complete so
couples like three months ago they they
finished up with that yeah okay all
right so I guess that's pretty much all
there is to it there's a 60 terabyte SSD
which is four times the capacity of the
next leading SSD Samsung's PM whatever
it's called PM 1633 a which is a 15
terabyte SSD we've actually reached out
to Samsung that's in a two and a half
inch form factor though by the way we
had actually reached out to Samsung
about getting us one of those and they
were they were not able to do so nor did
they even reply to our emails I actually
I actually wanted it for a specific
project I wanted it for the world's most
expensive PlayStation 4 a water-cooled
PlayStation 4 with you know 15 terabytes
of solid-state storage I thought that'd
be pretty cool no all right also from
the flash summit Toshiba and the
original article here is from the
register co uk Toshiba teases an even
higher capacity SSD quad level so yes
I'm su me that's what the Q stands for
yeah so four bits per cell which we
should probably explain a little bit
there's a fast as possible episode about
bits per so why don't you do that
explanation I've been doing a lot of
talking I'm gonna go get a drink of
water you explain why q yes okay it's
been a while since I've looked at this
but the gist of it is that so if you
were buying an SSD usually what you'll
see on the product page is it'll
indicate whether or the SSD is SLC mlc
or key LC and what that refers to is how
many bits of data each little memory
cell inside the NAND flash can hold so
an SLC Drive can only hold one bit per
cell whereas a TLC Drive can hold three
and more sounds better as far as more
obviously sounds better but the capacity
but as far as capacity it sounds better
but usually PLC drives they tend to be a
little bit slower performance wise so
this is a you cute qlc drive that holds
four bits per cell so we might be able
to see some really really good
capacities with it and indeed
they're kissing there this this I guess
it's a prototype but they're teasing it
as being a hundred terabytes there's not
a whole lot that's been confirmed right
now on this it looks like it's all talk
the the qlc technology was also released
very recently it looks like it would be
a 3d SSD so I guess the company that's
most famous for this is Samsung because
they marketed their 3d there are 3d SSDs
pretty heavily where instead of having
the chips all on one plane they're
actually stacked like so so it will
increase the data density so we're
looking at a 3d SSD with a PCIe gen3
interface so it's not SATA it's PCI
Express over hard hair bias at capacity
and oh hi Linus um three gigabytes a
second us acquit sequential read and one
gigabyte per second sequential right
javi gigabytes per second yeah that's
that's quite a bit more than like
Samsung has their 950 which is I think
their their highest and thing right now
that I can find but three I think is
almost a whole gig higher than that if
my memory serves me correctly yeah and
it's not leave an GME either because
this is uh let's see what like what
interface is it even using well that's
that's a big deal isn't because um more
bits per cell usually means a bit slower
yeah so yeah but I don't but this is but
because it's 3d and it's a via me so so
there's a couple of things to bear in
mind here so you've got a lot of NAND
dies you have many many many many many
flash chips that you can read from and
you can write to so assuming your
controller isn't a bottleneck assuming
you have a sophisticated enough
controller you can do these massive
throughput numbers mm-hmm even though
we're talking qlc flash which it
surprises me that they're putting this
in an enterprise product first frankly
well I think um it seems to be focused
more on kind of like playing the
copy-paste game removing huge files
around because also you look at the
random read and write which is measuring
iOS it's only 50,000 and 14,000 for
read/write respectively and you it's
extremely easy to find very affordable
consume
level say the SST I think say that's a
yeah
SATA SSDs that have numbers way above
that so it's yeah it seems to be more
suited for a me a farmer you're moving
around huge files where you get those
sources like a really good speeds like
something that I would even okay so here
again like so here's something I would
wonder are you even better off let's say
you were you were one of one of
Netflix's one of Netflix's things where
they want to install their hardware in
an ISPs space mm-hmm right so yeah hi
the term is escaping me but it's Friday
okay it's Friday it's been a long week
right so if I was Netflix the idea is I
want to use as little rack space as
possible mm-hmm I want a store as many
movies as I can and I want to serve as
many customers without unnecessary
delays and buffering as I can so very
high capacity drives look like well hey
that might be a very very very good idea
except that by the time you are starting
to hit these drives with a lot of random
operations are they even any better off
than mechanical well couldn't you split
your workload then like like let's say
just just accesses to your web page or
things like validating a login couldn't
you couldn't you do that with like
something faster on the random and they
just have these do nothing but post
videos and then if you were gonna do
that if you're gonna split the workload
anyway then how do you just have why
don't you spread out this data over more
drives so that people are less likely to
be trying to hit the same thing at the
same time well you could you could just
like to buy a bunch of these and they're
writing together but then that would get
very expensive probably so this is kind
of scary
um the qlc drive would have a three
petabyte to six petabyte workload over
its lifetime so
what does that lifetime what that sounds
like to me is that you could only write
this drive and correct me if I'm wrong
somewhere between 30 to 60 times okay so
a pedabytes a thousand TB so so like so
a million gigabytes yeah would be a
petabyte yeah yeah that actually give
you think about something like Netflix
that what so if it seems like you would
have to get you a lot of these so below
you would be so you're right I mean they
only change their library every once in
a while
uh-huh so as long as they're smart about
how they utilize them maybe it helps oh
no ok so hold on a second this is using
a PCI Express interface by the way I
think I might have said it was SAS or
something before but yeah and it was
PCIe let's move into sponsors for today
number one is Squarespace and Nick isn't
here so I don't have to do the
Squarespace read the way he says to do
it so I'm gonna say Squarespace old
slogans about Squarespace has many
slogans some of which we're very good
like I personally like to build a
beautiful a lot and some of them well
should have been changed like
Squarespace you should go change yeah
they change it all the time now it
appears to be Squarespace
set your website apart by using one of
our templated designs ok no but really
Squarespace is a great way to build a
website and not all Squarespace sites
look the same they have a wide variety
of different templates and once ya gussy
them up with artwork you customize them
you put your own copy on there boom you
end up with a gorgeous website that just
freakin works all the time
Squarespace allows you to edit your
website through their cloud-based tool
they had crap I was leading yes they
handle all the hosting so you don't have
to worry about like a server somewhere
that you might accidentally throw a USB
Drive or whatever the case may be and
our Squarespace site this is actually
this is such a fun fact our Squarespace
site has never gone down - Media Group
com well ok it did go down but that was
a domain registrar issue that actually
had so we were actually we were
directing the domain to the wrong place
due to an compromised account etc etc
anyway it did not go down because of
Squarespace is service
all their templates are future
responsive design so it means they look
great on any size screen they've got
commerce that comes with every site so
you can sell stuff on your page if you
want to end their cover pages feature
allows you to be one of those obnoxious
web 2.0 companies who has no information
on their website whatsoever other than
the name of the company and like a
slogan they have video backgrounds
they'll do
please don't make those sites but if you
must make it using Squarespace you can
save 10% off your first purchase by
heading over to oh there we go
squarespace.com slash when and by the
way you can try it for free for a couple
of weeks to just decide if it's right
for you there's no credit card required
speaking of trying things have you ever
thought yourself gee I'd sure like to
learn something today but going to
school is expensive and a lot of work
and my life is busy and I have stuff to
do well lynda.com could be the solution
for you it's used by literally millions
of people around the world which if you
go and crunch the numbers means that
lynda.com at what is it 25 bucks a month
is where their plans start is like a
pretty ballin company seriously like
ballin which I guess is why they sponsor
the land show and also because they're
just generally good guys we have a
number of people here at Linus Media
Group that use skills they learned on
lynda.com to get ahead in life by
getting a job at Linus Media Group
they've got more than 3000 courses
available and topics like web
development photography visual design
business software training like Excel
WordPress Photoshop things like digital
camera operation video editing that's
pretty cool I don't know what you're
doing right now
oh you're touching the screen okay
that's good they show you how to operate
computers actually they have tons of
different courses and they're taught by
industry experts with new courses added
every week so whether you want to take
your hobby to the next level or you want
to take your career to the next level
try out Linda calm and find out if it's
right for you there's a free 10-day
trial at lynda.com slash land show and
then nope I do not have an offer code
for that so sorry
but it's perfect I'm not sure what
you're doing
reading the wind on me know what you
just said to me oh no no I just know I
couldn't see the screen through the
microphone and you were just like kind
of like it looked like you were kind of
like fawning at the screen or something
was going on all right the nouveau has
been successfully correct this has been
a long time coming actually de nouveau
has held up surprisingly well so for
those of you who don't know de nouveau
is a copy protection scheme for games
and it's over it has been successfully
cracked with both doom and rise of the
Tomb Raider apparently already available
online with a functional bypass for
Deneuve o--'s anti tampering technology
it was correct the crack was created by
a Bulgarian hacker called boxxy boxxy
boxxy boxxy can you do a bulgarian
accent i have no idea what they sound
like bulgaria all right well he's also
working on a crack for Just Cause 3
along with several other recent de
nouveau titles the crack exploits a bug
in steam which allows users to play the
full game while steam thinks the game is
a free demo version it appears as though
this is given that this is a steam steam
exploit that it could be fixed with a
steam update so it may not be functional
for long so there you have it so you
will either have to buy the game or you
will have to never update steam again
DRM versus hackers is just like a
never-ending battle alright
quantum break is officially coming to
steam this isn't our rapid-fire news
topics let's go ahead and drop that in
the twitch chat in case you guys are
sort of curious about it at all let's go
at the original article here is from
overclocked 3d net I will go ahead and
go back to my thing so basically it's
coming September 14th 2016 so in about a
month it this will end its exclusivity
in the Windows Store I would love to say
that I
this is because Microsoft just has the
best interests of gamers at heart and
wants to support a more open ecosystem
in fact they've even made some
statements that would seem to support
that kind of do not walk on the green
screen second person I've caught doing
that today
gonna have to repaint that whole thing
that is a hassle that is a royal hassle
hashtag fired hash - no he's not fired
I'm just he does it again he might be
man anyway sorry it includes all the
updates that are available in the
Windows 10 store version will support
DirectX 11 and will not be a Universal
Windows platform game meaning that any
of the limitations that come with that
whether they're related to benchmarking
multi-gpu or whatever the case may be
framerate limits but will not be imposed
on it I'm still a little bit surprised
that games that there are windows App
Store no sorry not windows elsewhere
just Windows Store exclusive games yeah
surprises me a little bit by the time it
sinks in for you my hope is that it will
be over yeah there we go
but then again they've demonstrated as
they did with games for Windows Live
that they're willing to stick with a
terrible thing for an awful long time
before giving up that's kind of human
nature oh yes so well this thing is
basically on fire but let's stick with
it anyway pretty fine yeah all right
let's go ahead and go this is kind of
fun so the first commercial mission to
the moon approved for Florida company
moon Express I already love the name of
their company sounds like a plan to
express from Futurama delivery service
to the movie i I have to I have to
wonder if it's intentional like I hope
it's intentional that's freaking awesome
so the US government has given them the
go-ahead to launch the first commercial
mission to the moon so the moon Express
CEO and co-founder said it's a huge
milestone for us not quite as catchy as
one small step for man one large
whenever leap giant giant leap thank you
for mankind not quite as catchy as that
but maybe he
have quite as long to write it given
that he didn't sit in a spacecraft for a
long time you know I wonder I wonder
what the story is behind that I'm sure
I'm sure it's been talked about like
weather heat whether it was spontaneous
or whether he like thought about it and
planned it it had to require at least a
few minutes of pre-planning
I mean it's frustrating because you're
sports fan so you'll be able to relate
to this it's frustrating because the
greatest moments in sports are sometimes
made as much by the commentator as they
are by the athlete oh yeah because they
put it in the appropriate context they
get you amped up for it they they they
make the moment something that goes
beyond a fantastic athletic feat and
something that becomes culturally iconic
because you can like you can okay so the
the the Bobby Orr goal mm-hmm it's
amazing to watch
but with that with that commentation a
commentary commentation commentary
commentary thank you with that
commentary it's something that like like
it's like moving to a to a hockey fan
anyway so most people wouldn't care um
doesn't it drive you crazy when you can
tell that they had a sheet of paper on
in front of them with like epic moment
quotes that they've been thinking up
over the last month and they just say
well oh you you can always tell when
it's like oh you were staying up late at
night last week just trying to think of
this stuff and now you have your moment
American American commentators are the
worst I'm sorry
in what regard though you could be right
in depending on doing that I notice it
so much less on Canadian broadcasts the
contrived fake nonsense on a big game
win especially when it's like not a
close game like when when the when the
outcome has basically been decided since
the you know middle of the second period
or game yeah yeah yeah we're like
they've got like this quote that they
were obviously saving that makes it
like I'll f it like an epic triumph when
it was just kind of a beat-down I've see
I've actually seen I don't disagree with
you but I have seen it in other
countries as well like if I'm walking
the like Premier League in English soft
okay there could be a game pulled away
by halftime and then you know the
announcer will go on in this Golf
announcer style drone for the second 45
minutes and then with the final whistle
goes I'm just like okay like so your
point is very well taken they'll
understand what you're saying um all
right so back to back to going to the
moon the company has raised more than
thirty million dollars so far and
planned to unveil their mx1 a lander at
the Cape Canaveral Air Station the first
launch is targeted for late to 2017 this
is kind of funny the FAA has not
actually issued a launch license yet and
that will be considered separately from
the mission itself so while they do have
permission to travel between Earth's
stratosphere and the moon and land there
they do not have permission to actually
which layer of the atmosphere does the
FAA is jurisdiction in I don't know
either so I don't know if you asked the
FAA maybe it never ends you know what it
wouldn't surprise me all right ah else
we got oh the Kansas thing I thought was
pretty okay let's move on to that where
is that Oh what is that indeed I saw
what Kansas farm Suze max mind over
quote massive IP glitch unquote so let's
go ahead I'll pull up the original
article from the Washington Post you
want to go ahead and get us going on
this yeah so this is pretty nuts Oh max
mind is a company out of a wall fan
Massachusetts I should ride across the
river from where I lived when I was in
law school and they are a company that
maps IP addresses to geographical areas
now what they did is they had one one
point that they considered the default
center of the u.s. so and this one there
for a center of the universe exactly as
hashtag hashtag Canadian commentary okay
so and basically what this is
the geographic center of the country or
anything else is is suppose you had a
cardboard cutout shaped exactly like the
US and you balanced it on a pin the
geographic center is where it would
balance like where the pin would be and
this happened to be very close to these
folks folks his house that lived in
Kansas and so what ended up happening is
all this IP traffic was being mapped
back to essentially their front yard and
what ended up happening was for years
they had cops showing up at their door
at all hours accusing them of being
involved in all sorts of crime or
whatever other shenanigans and they're
just it's like random elderly couple
that lives on the farm or something I
had no idea was going on
so basically Mack's mind is responsible
for mapping IP addresses and they used
this this geographical center as the
default location for any us-based IP
address so let's say that you know oh
man like what even would be an example
of something that didn't have a proper
IP address and they just default like
why would they even be doing this I it
was a little bit unclear from the story
honestly maybe if someone was like you
know using a VPN but even then why
sometimes when mapping IPS apparently
they're able to only determine the
country of origin that's it yeah so
there it is mm-hmm
so so if all they know is oh you're
somewhere in the United States you get
mapped to this random place in Kansas I
mean these are some of the complaints
that this poor family has been dealing
with they've been accused of
interrupting email service for customers
of a certain small business they've been
accused of harbouring stolen vehicle
harboring runaway children and keeping
girls in the house to make pornographic
films I mean I really like how that last
ones in quotation marks but yeah so so
it says ambulances have appeared to
prepare to say suicidal persons FBI
agents federal marshals IRS collectors
and other law enforcement officers have
appeared on their doorsteps at all hours
of the day and night and even one random
war
a broken toilet was left in their
driveway without explanation all right
so max mind has since changed their
default location in the u.s. to the
center of a lake west of Wichita but in
the meantime the Arnold's have filed a
lawsuit against Mac mine max mine
seeking compensation punitive damages in
excess of $75,000 make a comment on that
yes so the reason they chose that dollar
amount in excess of $75,000 so here's
the reason for this super quick crash
course in jurisdiction of American law
so they follow the case in federal court
and if you want to file something in
federal court in the US there's two
required there you can do it in one of
two ways one is if it involves a federal
question or a federal law but the other
is if there's what's called diversity
assistantship or as the two parties in
this case the old couple and maximize or
from two different states and they are
and the amount in controversy is above
$75,000 so that's why there's a sort of
vague in excess we won't in excess of 75
grand
like who knows how much the actual
amount that they'll get will be but that
is just sort of like a venue selection
trick to get them at the federal court
as opposed to state court oh I see okay
makes sense yeah let's move on to a
pretty important rumor so the original
post here is actually from the Linus
tech tips forum because I think I think
they are quickly being wiped out and I'm
not gonna say anything about this
because I may or may not actually have
real information but basically here
there's an imgur post of what appears to
be I'm going to read it word for word it
is this image or post that is the entire
that is the entire source of everything
that I'm saying it appears to be an asus
rog Strix g 7 v 2 v MVC 0 3 3 t 7.3 inch
what seems to be a laptop of some sort
this this potentially completely
photoshopped page says that it okay it
seems to be a laptop because it has a
core i7 6700 H
you processor word next to this picture
of what appears to be a laptop so I
guess the implication being that one of
those is inside one of those ddr4 8 gig
ram 256gb SSD EMA period 2 1tb 7200rpm
something something that's a word in a
language that I don't understand
norwegian nvidia geforce gtx 1066 gb hmm
so the implication is then a laptop with
a gtx 1 0 6 0 6 gb could potentially be
a thing for nineteen thousand 999 of
whatever the devil these are the region
chrome is that is that right i think
that's what it said I wish I wish Luke
we're here because Luke is very good at
Scandinavian currency we were having a
discussion about this year today
that's an interesting talent don't worry
about it um so an interesting actually
no I'm not gonna point out anything
that's interesting about it there were
also some let's see if any of the other
listings are still are still alive it
looks like this stuff is being pulled
down so all the links that were
originally given for expert dot n o are
yep nope you know not I don't know what
any of this is but it definitely isn't
that so hmm very very interesting very
interesting all Scandinavian letters
we're easily Luke anyway Britain that's
as much information as I have that's all
the information I have to all right
self-driving Tesla original article
here's from the telegraph co uk saves a
man's life by steering him to the
hospital so this opens up and introduced
ok let's go through the basics the
basics of the story first also every
journal article from telegraph I think I
already said that originally posted by
fake Z Z on the forum so it his Tesla
Model X is credited with having helped
save an American man's life after its
autopilot function got him to the
hospital when he suffered a pulmonary
ilysm the man's name is Joshua Neely a
lawyer from Springfield Missouri he
called his wife and said something was
wrong that he couldn't breathe and
thinking it would be quicker than
pulling over to call an ambulance he set
the autopilot autonomous function of the
Tesla Model X he just got the car a few
weeks before this happened he doesn't
remember much after he set the mode as
the car drove him over 20 miles to
Branson he managed to steer the car the
last mile or so between the motorway and
the hospital so this is an interesting
debate mm-hmm how is it that we consider
Tesla's autopilot record because a
couple people have died now do they get
one in the bank if autopilot saves a
life is that how it is that how it works
like life savers lives taken I don't
know I'm not making the rules for this
I'm just asking questions we're gonna
straw pull this friends I haven't got a
straw pull this okay go ahead I mean I
mean I feel like this was inevitable
when you have when the design when
whoever's idea this was first said hey
why don't we try to make a self-driving
car but I don't know how do you measure
something like this whether or not like
this is a good or bad thing because okay
I'll say this so how much testing has
been done versus death rate because
people who just drive regular cars both
kill themselves and other people all the
time yeah so even though it's easy to
say oh you can't trust these computers
to drive cars if their fatality rate is
still much lower than you know some
random person behind the wheel but
you're you're okay the problem though is
that you're approaching this from a very
a very scientific standpoint like a
purely fact-based standpoint and the
reality of it is even for even for
people who care more about facts than
feelings
let's say it was you know your mom who
died in a self-driving car do you care
that the odds were better for her like
that the overall odds like fewer people
would die if we were all in self-driving
cars do you care your mom's dead and
maybe wouldn't have been dead if she had
been operating the steering wheel like
that's something to consider is that
while it's easy to kind of go oh the
greater good and this and that that
doesn't change that you're gonna be
dealing with people who are inherently
emotionally distraught and very upset
and prepared to make a very loud noise
about why self-driving cars are met are
bad if someone close to them dies in one
or is seriously injured in one where as
we all accept just because of because
we've all been born into a world where
cars operated by people are the norm
we all accept the risks that come along
with a manually operated car people also
like to feel like they're in control
which is why people tend to be even more
afraid of flying than they are to
driving even though flying is too simply
much safer you have a feeling of not
being and controlling if something goes
wrong there's nothing you can do about
it that's right and I would also make
the argument that flying is a much more
terrifying way to die because there I
can think of very few scenarios where
you won't have an awful lot of time to
think about it yeah and you just like
plummet for quite a while I don't know
what the terminal velocity of the human
being is but it's not that high yeah so
no it's not so we've got 65% of you
saying yes we can evaluate autopilot
systems on the on the bank system what
to be fair one end one out you come out
net even when these start becoming more
mainstream I feel like this is how we're
going to make decisions on them like
this is how governments are going to
regulate them this is the way that
companies are going to be approaching
safety it's so it's awfully going to
affect like how people use them so
I don't know I just I'm wondering with
the whole you know the Marsha progress
and all that like I'm wondering how much
voices of people that oh I lost a loved
one in a in a self-driving car accident
and maybe I wouldn't have had they
actually been controlling the car I
wonder if those boys will just cos will
just end up being lost in the
conversation because ultimately I think
we're going to make decisions based on
more words numbers I don't know I mean
the thing is is that it's pretty hard to
lose a voice in the conversation these
days with social media being what it is
true yeah I mean people can you know
with through amplification factors like
Twitter and reddit all it takes is one
viral incident okay suddenly the
conversation changes you know at least a
little bit so and at the end of the day
I mean any politician is at the mercy of
the voters so whatever they can do
quietly behind closed doors that is
something that their voters wouldn't
agree with is all fine and good but as
soon as something goes viral and there's
a bunch of pressure and it looks like
they might actually not get reelected if
you're a career politician not getting
reelected is like getting fired
effectively exactly or like or you know
if you're let's say a senator and you
have to go back to being the mayor of
you know three sticks Nebraska then you
know that's it's like getting a huge
demotion within with the coma C
advantage it does become a career I
think I don't know how it is in Canada
but like in the US House income a see
success rate in the election is like
over 90 percent like most of these
people were there for a long time
so basically we're looking at something
that is potentially very emotional and
and can be driven by fear
absolutely so I don't know yeah because
yeah I mean how many self or like
autonomous vehicles other than cars are
there if they're still it really aren't
all that many like most metro systems
and train systems they have a human
conductor or or a human driver you know
I don't know if this guy has one I think
there might be a remote controller
though I'm actually not sure I slowed
the SkyTrain is I'll see how it matters
but
okay if you're gonna hate on the
SkyTrain hate on the SkyTrain right okay
the SkyTrain doesn't go anywhere it
covers yeah that's true tiny fraction
yeah of the Greater Vancouver area that
it's basically irrelevant our mass
transit in North Carolina is a joke -
I'm not trying to take on that this is
just as bad so all right well speaking
of things that are bad the end of the
show is bad because the show's ending
not because the show's dead and maybe
the show was without--without when they
said if it was a bet if it was a bad
show it would be good at this ending so
yes maybe I'll do a straw poll is the
show bad or the end bad the show is bad
a show was that actually we even like
that is perfect and is bad this pool is
bad all right let's find out was bad and
I did not put an option for Michael
Jackson all right
it has been a long week it's been two
very long I don't even know why probably
because last week was a holiday week
we're also a little bit short-handed
this week yeah a little short-handed
this week what was Luke not here
Brandon's out today mm-hmm what was
people hating people hating they're safe
yeah every single every single voter is
saying something's bad it's like look at
this negativity they mostly hate your
poll I mostly hate my poll mm-hmm I can
