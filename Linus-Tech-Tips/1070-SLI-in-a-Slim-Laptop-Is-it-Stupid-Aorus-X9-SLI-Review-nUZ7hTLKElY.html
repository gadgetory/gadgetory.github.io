the thinnest lightest most powerful and
perhaps most RGB 1070 SLI laptop ever as
for whether anyone was actually asking
for an RGB 1070 SLI laptop but maybe
this is one of those things that we
didn't know we wanted until we had one
or maybe it isn't the only thing I know
for sure is that Sennheiser gives you
the best there pxc 550 wireless
headphones feature up to 30 hours of
battery life
noise guard hybrid adaptive noise
cancellation and more learn more at the
link below
consider the Lamborghini veneno it's not
everyone's favorite Lamborghini
aesthetically but like it's still a
Lambo and the styling of the ARS x9 is
similarly polarizing other than the
muted black exterior it's one of the
most gamer II looking laptops that's
been through the lab in a while
meaning that it'll definitely turn heads
at your next LAN event but showing up to
a meeting with this would be about like
showing up to a hockey game in a wetsuit
some kinds of head turning aren't
necessarily positive I do have to give
it points for build quality though the
aluminum around the keyboard and the
chassis itself are both extremely rigid
and at 7.9 pounds it's not the easiest
thing to carry but it's not unreasonable
given its power and it makes it so that
it's not going to move around
accidentally on your desk plus it's got
enough IO on it to make it look like the
Flying Spaghetti Monster if you actually
plug everything in that's something you
can't take for granted these days and
this over-the-top build philosophy makes
its way to the internals as well our
model sports a core i7 78 20 HK 32 gigs
of DDR 4 ram 2 512 gig nvme SSDs not
configured in raid on our model
curiously and two gtx 1070 GPUs this is
a really unusual graphics configuration
the disadvantage is you've got to deal
with the usual performance scaling and
power issues that are associated with
SLI the potential advantage is higher
frame rates than a GTX 1080 currently
the best performing single mobile GPU in
supported games and then maybe the
ability to spread out your heat
generating components to make it thinner
on the subject of heat generating
components the i7 7820 HK CPU is
notorious for overloading the thermals
of basically every laptop that we've
tested it in even that water-cooled one
from Asus so then has gigabytes for fan
design been able to tame the beast
at stock clocks actually yes I mean it's
a thin and light for what it is no book
so it wasn't particularly quiet but it
also doesn't have an annoying tone to
the sound and the CPU maxed out at
around seventy five degrees while
maintaining 3.5 gigahertz turbo on all
four cores this is a great result let's
move on to gaming performance this one
is a bit of a mixed bag since the years
now 2017 and SLI scaling is as
inconsistent as it's ever been at its
best the ARS x9 with its two 8k gtx 1070
s destroys a desktop with a 1080 but at
its worst it actually gets beaten by a
max-q
gtx 1070 in a laptop a quarter its
weight due to sli driver nonsense and
yes we double-checked that result so
this is kind of disappointing for
prospective buyers but it's also
expected and without giving away too
much about our conclusion for this video
it reinforces our belief that a single
better GPU is in the vast majority of
cases a better option than two lesser
ones even at 4k resolution though that's
nothing against the x9 s display it's
got a matte finish it comes with X right
Pantone calibration out of the box and
looks really good though with that said
I would personally have gone for the
1440p 120 Hertz version which is a wva
rather than an IPS display but would
deliver a much smoother gaming
experience without again this is my
opinion giving up anything meaningful in
terms of image sharpness I'm really glad
that gigabyte has that option now the
keyboard has custom mechanical switches
with a long travel but I can't say that
I really enjoy typing on them the
tactile bump feels more like a tactile
hitch which means that unless you press
pretty hard naturally you might find
yourself missing keystrokes from time to
time I personally wish that they had
stuck to something more like what is on
the Aero 15 X
that one is a much better keyboard for
both typing and gaming in my opinion the
good news though is that the quality of
the trackpad is similar here and you get
a bonus
falken graphic on it it has solid
tracking and a tactile feel in the click
even though it does seem a bit small
given the size of the rest of the laptop
flipping the x9 over to open it up I
will admit that the way that they made a
bird out of the vents looks pretty darn
slick whatever I might have said
aesthetically earlier and then that
taking it off reveals a completely free
two and a half inch drive Bay to empty
sodium slots to fill them dot two slots
a very generous application of thermal
compound and a very high capacity ninety
4.2 watt hour battery that would give
you great battery life on a less
power-hungry machine as for the x9 well
let's just say it's a gaming laptop so
those LEDs under the logo well you can
set them to things like fan speed or CPU
or GPU temps but you should probably use
them to monitor the battery the webcam
is pretty good and it includes a feature
called smart cam which allows you to
remove the background while you're
streaming like this guy from the
reviewers guide and you can tell he's
really pumped on smart cam and the
speakers though this is somewhat
predictable on a larger machine sounded
pretty darn good so it's not bad it's
just a little misconfigured the x9 as it
is next to me here costs thirty-eight
hundred US dollars and with a lower
resolution and higher refresh rate
display maybe a 1080 a single SSD to
save a buck and then maybe we could drop
some of the RAM it might still fall
behind the Asus G 701 vi in terms of its
bang for the buck but it would be
thinner and much sexier than that one
with a more sensible display as it is
unless you only play a couple of games
that you know are super well optimised
for SLI and you value resolution over
refresh rate the ARS x9 doesn't make the
most sense but what might make sense for
