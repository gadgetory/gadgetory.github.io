brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX
now lucky me this is the first time that
I've had an opportunity to check out a
5k display but this is the first time
that I've been able to do it on a
display that will work on a PC so this
is the Dell you p27 15 k 5k monitor it
has five thousand one hundred and twenty
pixels this way two thousand eight
hundred and eighty pixels this way for
four times the total pixel count of a
2560 by 1440 display yeah this thing is
crazy crazy sharp that's about 14
megapixels 60 times per second so let's
start with a general physical overview
on the front it's a 27-inch monitor so
you're gonna have that I guess there's
also a glass bezel around it so it's an
edge less bezel designed personally I
really do like this particular style the
stand itself it's it's not a crazy thin
monitor or anything like that but it's
not bulky by any stretch of the
imagination the stand is a nice sort of
sandblasted anodized aluminum design
it's got a Dell logo on the back of
Kensington lock and then there's the IO
and that's where things get a little bit
tricky because you might be thinking to
yourself well - hold on a second what do
you mean 5k I mean what's it what's a 5k
it does my mom does my graphics card
support 5k the answer is no probably not
at least not on one output so on the
bottom of this monitor you're gonna find
a USB 3 hub so that's one input and four
outputs then you're gonna find a
full-size display port and then you're
gonna find another one right next to it
and those two have lines around them
that say okay this is for a 5k by 3k
that is how they do it to DisplayPort
inputs in order to drive this entire
monitor there's also a mini DisplayPort
in back there but that one only supports
up to 4k max so you're gonna have to
deal with interpolation now this thing
is not cheap it's over $2000 but at
least it comes with the kinds of
professional grade you know quality and
features that you'd expect for a monitor
of that caliber
so it's an IPS panel it's got a ten bit
it's a 10 bit panel so that's a billion
colors featuring a 12 bit lookup table
so you're gonna be able to work with
broad gamut content if you want to it
supports 99% of Adobe RGB it's got
support for advanced calibration
features with an X right color
calibrator and it even comes with a
report in the box certifying its Delta e
less than two calibration so you
shouldn't even really need to do
anything unless you have your own
personal needs that are a little
different from what you might get out of
factory calibration I'm not really sure
how much there else there is to really
say about it other than that it looks
absolutely stunning from the front from
the back so why don't we move on to this
little tiny box next to it that is
actually powering it so this is Intel's
Broadwell based nook so that's their
little you know next unit of computing
thing computers that fit in your hands
and I just thought this was cool because
this demo right here where we're zooming
around and panning around on New York
City is actually being powered by this
machine and thanks to its dual mini
DisplayPort outputs it is able to drive
a 5k display something that we wouldn't
have imagined possible
only a couple short years ago I think
there's a couple little things on my
cheat sheet here that I missed so the
contrast rated contrast ratio is a
thousand to one which is pretty typical
for a static contrast ratio on a on a
very solid display the pixels per inch
is 218 just in case you don't want to do
the math yourself it's got eight
millisecond great a great response time
rating so you may actually be able to
game on it half decently assuming you
have the graphics horsepower in order to
drive this kind of a resolution and
reality check you don't so that's
hopefully coming in the future and I
think that pretty much wraps it up
absolutely beautiful but there is a
price to pay and at its current pricing
I'm not sure how many people it's going
to make sense for especially given the
pricing of the iMac 5k Retina that also
includes a computer built into it but of
course there's plenty of time for for
Dell to get more competitive and for all
this technology to get more competitive
very excited for the future of
high-resolution displays speaking of
displays I'd like to do a shout out for
our sponsor here at the show phantom
glass these guys make great protectors
for your displays the ones that go on
the ones on your phones not the ones on
your desks although that could
potentially come in the future they're
made of Gorilla Glass so they're
extremely scratch resistant extremely
clear and they have that same oleophobic
and nice touch finish on the top of them
they're basically impossible to get
bubbles stuck under so they look exactly
like the surface of your actual phone
and they're available at store dot
phantom dot glass linked in the video
description I also want to give a
shout-out to HyperX their YouTube
channel has tons of great gaming content
you guys are definitely gonna want to
check that out and they are a huge part
of the reason that we are able to be
here as well guys click that subscribe
button so you don't miss any of our CES
content or anything else ever again and
I think that pretty much wraps it up
we'll see you at the next crazy booth
here at CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
