majority of the people watching our
build guides are not at home
surrounded by piles of new computer
parts screwdriver in hand following
along step by step assembling the exact
machine that we're building on screen
know most of you are just here for well
Hardware porn and that's okay it's
nothing to be ashamed of and today is
all about giving the people what they
want a workstation slash gaming build so
high-end that few people will ever have
a genuine use for it let alone enough
spare cash to justify buying it this is
the drink spitter
I mean thread Ripper all right you guys
know the drill
just kidding we won't need one of those
but what we will need is a clean
workstation an ESD strap a screwdriver a
magnetic parts tray a pair of side
cutters and I like to have a pair of
pliers on hand just in case you got a
you know tighten your nuts
I also recommend testing the system on
top of the motherboard box to make sure
that it works before you begin the final
assembly all AMD thread Ripper CPUs have
a lot in common
tons of cash up to 40 Meg's and 64 PCI
Express Lanes so it mostly came down to
picking how many cores we wanted well we
wanted all of them so we chose the 1950
x16 pour 32 thread processor now I could
lie and say I'm gonna use it to
livestream myself playing games while
encoding 4k video in the background but
we all know it's just for Facebook and
streaming web video on the subject of
which let's insert the processor now
normally I just copy-paste these
instructions from
another build guide using a similar
socket but this time our big new chip
has a big new socket AMD's tr4 and it's
a little different to start we'll use
the fancy thread Ripper branded size 20
torques a screwdriver that actually
comes in the CPU box loosen the screws
labeled 3 2 1 in that order until the
load plate lifts itself up next lift the
rail frame by gently pulling on these
blue handles and then slide out the
external cat sled we're going to replace
it with our thread Ripper CPU and its
carrier frame carefully slide the
carrier frame into the rail frame making
sure it slides all the way to the end of
the rails and remove the pnp cap that's
been protecting the sockets 4090 four
pins now gently close the carrier frame
so that the CPU makes contact with the
pins pushing down on the blue handles to
fix the carrier frame in place then
close the load plate and fasten screws
one two and three in that order with a
recommended torque value of twelve
pounds per inch of force finally take a
moment to bask in the glory of the cow
tipper the thread Ripper AMD's thread
Ripper CPU support up to one terabyte of
wait a minute actually yes one terabyte
of RAM
if you populate all eight DIMM slots
with 128 gig lr or load reduced dims
those aren't even out yet they'll be
super expensive and would be total
overkill so we're using 8 16 gig sticks
of trident zr gb ram from tea skill
because you know we didn't want to be
overkill and 128 gigs seemed pretty
reasonable obviously though you could go
with 64 or 3
to save a buck to install your dims pull
back the tabs on the memory slots align
each module according to the key in the
socket and press firmly on both sides
until the latch closes if you're using
just four sticks then use the lighter
grey slots for other configurations
refer to your motherboards user guide
you'll probably notice that there's one
more slightly different looking slot
that's been left unoccupied leave this
one alone for now but get excited
because we will be coming back to it
later we're basically using the pant
splitter I mean thread Ripper of cases
it's cooler masters latest addition to
their hallowed Cosmo series the C 700p
it's got many of the characteristics
that these cases have become known for
like the suicide doors and the aluminum
skids to make hauling its forty-nine
pound heft around just a little easier
and it is 2017 after all it's got
integrated RGB lighting and a curved
tempered glass side panel now as cool as
these doors are we start by taking them
off simply open them and while gripping
near the hinge pull upward stash the
panel's particularly the glass one back
in the box they came from this is also a
good time to give ourselves more room to
work by taking out these screws and
sliding the internal panels free we're
going to replace the cases included fans
with cooler master master fan Pro 140s
placing three in the front for intake
and one for exhaust at the back remove
the cases front covers by tilting and
then pulling up on layer one and then
simply pushing out layer two then it's
just a matter of screwing the fans on to
the 140 millimeter rails with the fan Li
it's pointing towards the motherboard
tray next pull to remove the cases
magnetic rear fairing so you can access
the fan screws here and mount your new
RGB fan with this
towards the back next check this out
one of these SSD sleds is actually an
integrated fan hub in disguise and this
is where all of our fan leads will go
as for the RGB leads we'll connect those
to the RGB hub that came with the fans
it's magnetic so we can just stick at
any old place and leave the internal USB
connector dangling for now our
motherboard choice the asus rog zenith
extreme is full of badass features like
802.11 ad Wi-Fi and their live - oled
screen for measuring vitals
it also has what's called dim dot - a
riser that adds space for two more MDOT
two slots and a 10 gigabit PCI Express
network card which is actually a pretty
good value if you wanted one anyway if
you don't care about that stuff you can
still totally follow this guide and save
about $200 with the Asus prime X 399 a
so our i/o shield is pre attached that's
cool
meaning that we can jump right to
installing the standoffs that came with
the case in all of the points labeled a
for e-atx
set the board in place over the middle
standoff post then use these screws to
fasten the board to the rest you can
plug in the two eight pin CPU power
connectors now to do your future self
assaulted and since we still have easy
access to the motherboard will also show
you guys how to plug in the rest of the
annoying tiny things the front panel
connectors for the power LED hard drive
LED reset switch and power switch the
fancy front USB 3.1 gen2 connector here
and the USB 3.1 gen2 'srgb and system
audio along the bottom so to keep our
rig chilling out Mac
relaxin all cool we're gonna be using
the cooler master master liquid 240
all-in-one liquid cooler high-end
cooling is basically a requirement if
you are overclocking thread Ripper this
one comes with a lot of hardware for all
the different sockets it supports but
we'll be using the socket TR for mount
which at the time of filming is sold
separately and available only from qu a
masters website now normally this is the
part of a build where I freak out and
realize that I've installed my
motherboard without first mounting the
cooler bracket on the back but today I
don't have to worry about that because
the tr4 socket is sturdy AF and the pump
actually mounts directly to it like a
little baby monkey start by fastening
your fans we're using RGB ones to match
the rest of the case with the stickers
against the radiator using these long
screws letting the fan leads hang
towards the motherboard tray next mount
the radiator to the top of the case by
popping off the cases dust filter and
fastening the rad to the mounting rails
using these eight screws connect the fan
headers to the included Y adapter and
plug the other end into the CPU fan
header here will connect the RGB leads
to the included hub like we did earlier
but right now we've actually got a
problem we have to RGB hubs each
requiring a USB 2.0 header and our
motherboard only has one such header you
know what that say you guys I'm done if
I can't have all my RGB working I'm
leaving just have dinner sent to my
trailer oh okay so apparently this is a
pretty simple problem to solve
what's 25 bucks for one of these
internal USB hubs on a seven thousand
dollar build so we're gonna mount it
here connect up all the USB cables then
wire up its molex power cable now it's
time to mount the block to the CPU we'll
start by peeling off this one
label and placing two rice grain size
dabs of the included thermal compound on
the center of the CPU now arrange the
2tr four mounting brackets like this and
start tightening them down if you think
it looks weird that the cooler doesn't
cover the entire chip don't worry
on thread Ripper the CPU dies the parts
that actually produce heat are in the
center anyway so all that's left is
plugging in the pump header way down
here and then using this handy extension
cable to route it behind the motherboard
tray using a power supply calculator
might suggest that a 600 watt PSU would
be sufficient so naturally we went with
a power supply that coolermaster says
will be completely silent up to 600
watts and is capable of double that with
efficiency in excess of 80 plus titanium
now we're not here to mislead you
the master watt make her 1200 mij with
it's all made in Japan components and
10-year warranty not to mention thousand
dollar price tag was a because we can
move and the V 750 at a tenth of the
price will do you just fine for this
build just make sure that whatever power
supply you go with you grab something
with two eight pin EPS connectors thread
Ripper can run with a single connector
but you'll be losing the ability to
overclock
and risking instability as well as
issues with higher end memory start by
connecting all the cables to the power
supply while it's still accessible
you'll need the 24 pin connector to
power the motherboard to 6 plus 2 pin
PCI Express connectors for the graphics
card to SATA chains 1 molex cable and
the 2 8 pin CPU cables that you managed
earlier
unfortunately the cables that came with
this power supply aren't sleeved and
cable mod doesn't make a kit for it but
they do make cable extenders so we'll
connect these to the ends of our cables
hiding the excess slack in the basement
next
gently flex the power supply cover so
you can finagle it onto little pedestal
in the basement or you could just take
off these four screws and not be lazy
place it fan side down install the four
screws in the back like so then wipe it
tear from your eye when you realize that
no one's ever gonna see your ball air
power supply now we could put normal
storage in here
a single M thought to drive would be
blazing fast on its own but before the
end of this year AMD is planning to
release a driver update that will enable
bootable and DME raid on X 399 so how
could we not be a f-word future-proof
with a few of Corsairs high-speed MP 500
SSDs we begin by removing the m2 heat
spreader by unscrewing these three
fasteners being careful not to slip and
scratch this nice plate here next we'll
grab the small baggie from the
motherboard box that contains the m-dot
to stand off and cap and install the
standoff in the nut that matches the
length of our m dot to drive this one
happens to be an 80 millimeter stick so
we're using the nut marked 20 to 80 all
that's left then is to insert the SSD at
an angle press it down fasten it on the
opposite end and replace the fancy heat
spreader and you're done where are you
we're gonna use that same mounting
procedure as before except this time
instead of going directly on the board
our two additional SSDs will go on this
nifty little add-in card one on each
side
we then slot the card into our last
remaining dim slot such that this little
gap hops over the dim got to signpost
press firmly until the open tab closes
itself
they Walla over a terabyte of wicked
fast storage now you might wonder at
this point why our build doesn't contain
a hard drive we clearly have the budget
for it and that last bit is exactly why
we figure anyone spending this kind of
money on their workstation especially
one with 10 gig networking should
probably just have a
separate storage box elsewhere on their
network for our graphics card we
considered a Quadro but from our recent
findings they're not actually better in
many applications than consumer cards so
if your use case specifically benefits
from Quadro go with that but we chose
the GTX 1080 TI amp extreme edition from
ZOTAC remove these three PCI slot covers
two of them are for the graphics card
and one is actually for our 10 gigabit
network card remove the protective cover
from the card edge and align the card
carefully with the motherboards PCIe
slot and the openings at the back of the
case push the card in firmly until the
slot tab snaps shut then put the K
screws back in finally plug in the 2 8
pin PCI Express power connectors that we
attached to the power supply earlier now
this technically isn't a graphics card
but you can throw your network card in
at this point to this slots a good
choice but thanks to thread rippers 64
PCI Express Lanes
you really don't have to think about it
too much just throw it in there and put
the screw in our case is deep covered
basement and the wide gap between the
motherboard tray and the door make cable
management a piece of cake especially if
you're not the perfectionist type since
most of the mess not including our RGB
hub Spaghetti Monster will be hidden
behind the internal panels that we
removed earlier so once we replace all
the doors
she ain't looking too shabby for
peripherals were using cooler masters
master keys Pro L RGB keyboard their
master mouse Pro L mouse and a swift rx
XL mouse pad now let's put it all
together now I promise we're getting to
the sizzle real soon but first a couple
quick tweaks and the BIOS we're gonna
configure our RAM by going to the
extreme Tweaker tab and changing the AI
overclocked tuner from auto to do CP
then we're going to do a basic overclock
using the EZ tuning wizard
in our case we got an easy 8%
performance boost now this is also a
good time to configure your MDOT to raid
unfortunately we can't show you this now
because the feature won't be supported
for a couple more weeks meaning that we
save and we're done now we've covered
installing your operating system pretty
thoroughly on the past so just check out
this guide on the forum that we'll have
linked below as for drivers your
motherboard actually comes with a flash
drive with the latest ones for our audio
your network card your chipset etc
meaning you just got to go over to
Nvidia comm and get the latest for your
graphics card leaving us with nothing
left to do but admire our creation is it
a great value well in its current state
it's the most expensive build we've ever
done but with some tweaks that wouldn't
affect performance noticeably for most
people compared to what you'd have spent
for a 16 core bed spinning thread
ripping PC even a year ago it actually
ends up looking pretty compelling so
long live competition in the CPU
industry and long live coolermaster for
sponsoring this build guide time for the
sexy gland now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
