unboxing of a kensington notebook
docking station I actually have no idea
what a notebook docking station is
exactly in this context but NCIX has a
bunch of these and so I thought what the
hey let's do an unboxing and see what's
going on inside the box so the first
thing we find inside is an installation
guide and that could be useful for
someone like me who doesn't oh my
goodness look at this thing for someone
like me who doesn't know exactly what a
notebook docking station is good for
okay about the size of a typical wall
poster so that's in a variety of
different languages including English
francais Deutsch Italian Spanish as well
as Dutch of all things okay and here we
go so you install software all it has
drivers your life just got easier no
need to plug multiple peripherals into
your notebook every time you return to
the desk through one USB connection the
docking station connects you instantly
to your USB mouse keyboard printer and
other peripherals as an added benefit
placing your notebook on top of the
docking station allows for better
cooling of your machine so it has some
drivers and has a little instruction on
how to use it with a USB 2.0 port so
let's have a look at the docking station
itself and see what all the fuss is
about so first we have drivers including
drivers from Windows Vista remember
Windows Vista drivers will work on
Windows 7 and the may also have Windows
XP drivers so those are the supporting
operating systems here we have what
appears to be a power adapter I'm fairly
certain I'm going to find a power
adapter inside yes
so your typical wall warrant style power
adapter nothing really to see here and
here is the docking station so we have a
USB a 2 B cable so this is going to plug
into your notebook and this one is going
to plug into the docking station and
then we have the docking station so find
out how this bag
opens let's just tape closed here ok
I'll be needing my knife for this
because apparently that's very strong
tape so here we go so warm all is going
on with this guy so hold on there's a
warning on the front of it have a look
at that first if Windows disables your
notebook speakers upon installation of
the docking station refer to the
troubleshooting section of the user menu
ok so you can see here on the back we've
got a variety of different connections
so it looks like we have a LAN port we
have 1 2 3 4 5 USB 2.0 ports we have a
microphone port as well as a headphone
jack we also have a USB input as well as
our power input now the bottom of the
docking station has what appears to be
rubberized
4 rubberized mounting feet so those are
going to make it very difficult for it
to slip around if you have it positioned
on the desk and then it's got a couple
of what looked like sort of lucky things
here so if you have any insight into
what these guys are for please do let me
know leave a comment under the video and
I'll definitely take a look at that
cameraman is having a look at the part
number for whatever reason so this is
the SD 100 maybe he's doing that because
I haven't actually mentioned it yet on
the top you can see actually you know
what here cameraman stare at this for a
second I'm gonna go get a laptop don't
worry we'll take as long as it sounds
like it'll take got it got a laptop so
here the way this is positioned is so
that you can put your laptop on it like
this so here cameraman come have a look
at the back so basically all you do is
you take this USB cable and you plug it
into one of the ports on your notebook
you plug this in over here and then you
get all of these interfaces as well as
as Kensington mentions there's like the
rubberized thing on the top here so your
laptop's not gonna slip if you put it on
here so that means that you get a little
bit of extra space under the notebook
itself for more cooling now I've
actually found in my own personal
testing with
coolers that it is just as effective to
place the notebook on a hard surface
versus the carpet as it is to put a fan
under it so something like this will
probably be quite effective and this was
even on a gaming model and keeping your
notebook adequately cool when you are
using it so thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look at the
Kensington I think it was SD 100 wasn't
SD 100 notebook docking station don't
