arms race and often an unpredictable one
I mean look at phones first we wanted
smaller than we wanted flips than we
wanted touchscreens and now we want
bigger and bigger with an appetite for
massive black phones that can't be
waitwhat gold phones ok well this video
is about a laptop anyway which made
golden laptops
alright you lost me there this is a non
ridiculous black laptop with more
horsepower than my son's tricycle the
gigabyte p34 wv3
fractal design listens and the define
our five case was made with feedback
from you the PC community so click
wherever you want to learn more about
here and here now I was obviously being
facetious in the intro there the specs
alone tell us that today's featured item
is designed for a different customer
than Apple's new MacBook inside the 21
millimeter thick chassis you'll find a
quad core Core i7 4720 HQ that turbo 2
3.0 to 3.1 gigahertz Aundre sustain for
core load for me up to 16 gigs of ddr3
memory up to 512 gigs of em SATA SSD
storage and 2 terabytes of hard drive
based storage and Intel two spatial
stream AC wireless card that I had
connected it up to 780 megabit per
second and managing 42 to 45 megabytes
per second transfer speeds from my
server man Wi-Fi has come a long way and
a dual graphics solution comprised of
Intel HD graphics 4600 and a gtx 970m 3
gig graphics card yeah you heard me
right this puppy packs a serious GPU
punch for gamers on the go removing the
bottom reveals gigabytes dual fan supra
cooling branded cooling solution that
they've been using to make thinner
gaming devices under their own brand and
their premium ARS brand for about a year
now it's pretty simple in principle
intake at the front and strategically
along the bottom to keep the wrist rest
and gaming Keys cool with heat pipes
carrying that heat to the back where it
can be exhausted without making your
palm sweaty I just wish it was a fair
bit quieter it seems like gigabytes fan
profiles could use some tuning here
since the fan ramps up at even a mere
sort of 10 to 20 percent CPU load
immediately upon beginning my physical
tour here I realized that my comparison
of this compact gaming notebook to
Apple's latest and greatest MacBook was
even more inappropriate than I initially
thought the P 34 W has actual ports on
it specifically a power in HDMI out SD
card reader and two USB 3.0 ports on the
right and the lock a real tech powered
Gigabit Ethernet port VGA and two more
USB 3 ports and a headphone and
microphone combo jack on the
flipping this puppy open reveals the
1080p IPS screen with a couple
front-facing which is nice for loudness
but decidedly laptop grade speakers
under it I'm happy to see this compared
to a TN panel but it should be noted
that not all IPS displays are created
equally motion blur and processing leg
were non issues here from using it but
contrast is noticeably unexceptional and
there's some wicked backlight bleed
along the top and bottom edges on dark
backgrounds on my sample the keyboard
and touchpad are similarly unexceptional
and while I appreciate the separate
buttons and solid tracking for the
touchpad the plastic surface is
something I'd like to see gone on any
laptop over $1000 and while the keyboard
is well laid out with a nice bright
backlight it and the wrist rests flex
far too much to deliver a satisfying
typing experience which is actually a
complaint I have about the general build
quality of this notebook the screen and
hinge feel robust
so I wouldn't expect any breakage there
but it seems like gigabyte sacrificed
all the space inside the main chassis
that would normally be allocated for
structural support tuba gods of thinness
and lightness I played with the p34 w's
bigger cousin back at CES and told
gigabyte that if they sent me anything
with that kind of flex to it I was going
to call them out on it and while this
one is not as bad as that one I'm going
to call them out on it anyway what's the
point of making a computer out of metal
if it bends more than a plastic shell
would have anyway but some people buy
for bang for the buck and are willing to
be a little careful with their fancy
piece of machinery so let's have a look
at gaming performance then shall we at
high details with very high textures 4x
TxAA and motion blur disabled at its
native resolution of 1080p the gtx 970m
in our thin and light gamers delight
here manages a whopping seventy six
frames per second in my standard Crysis
3 run pretty impressive that is until
you let the laptop sit for a while on a
hard flat surface
have the GPU throttle way the truck down
to 671 mega Hertz at 87 degrees and lose
a solid 25% of that performance yes this
baby thermal throttles but the good news
is that it's not as severe as that
bricks gaming computer we checked out a
while back and not enough that gigabyte
would have been better off simply
putting a lower grade less power-hungry
part into their design like they would
have in that case and there are some
other positive takeaways - battery life
is in line with what I'd expect from a
gaming notebook at 2 hours and 40
minutes and the PC mark work suite and
overall I think gigabyte has actually
done a swell job of targeting their
audience presumably the traveling gamer
who may have to hook up that VGA port to
a boardroom projector from time to time
with a rocking spec list at a reasonable
price compared to this time not Apple's
MacBook Gold or whatever they're calling
it but something like the Razer Blade
which has similar specs and a much
higher price tag because that's the
decision buyers will ultimately have to
make settle for throttling and weaker
craftsmanship or pay the significant
premium product tax for what is
essentially thicker metal from a brand
like apple or Razer or even gigabytes
own a horas for that matter speaking of
paying a premium why would you pay a
premium for your mobile carrier ting
comm is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction and charging a real price
how do you focus on customer service
well when you call them for example you
don't talk to a robot or an automated
menu you actually get put through
directly to a real person also you only
pay for what you use the average ting
bill is only $24 per month per device so
what you do is you go on their site
that's Linus ENCOM you fire up their
savings calculator and you actually just
enter okay well here we're gonna let my
last few bills here was my usage and it
spits out a number that says hey this is
how much you would pay if you switched
over to ting if you've got a contract
they'll pay 25% of your cancellation fee
up to 75 bucks not to mention that if
you use our link that's linus 10.com
you'll also get $25 in the service
credit or 25 bucks towards and you
vice as well so I think that's pretty
much it guys like this video if you
