and I use terms like like skew with you
guys but I know you don't necessarily
know what that means so skew stands for
stock keeping unit and that means that
it is a particular configuration of
notebook that has a unique identifier
like a part number whereas the shell
that is what the notebook looks like
could have any number of SKUs associated
with it if you had different
configurations like different CPUs
amounts of memory graphics cards or
whatever else so this skill is unique
this is using MSI's GTS 685 shell so it
is a 15.6 inch notebook it has their
Dynaudio in my testing significantly
better than average speaker system it
has their LED lighting strips it has
it's got a decent keyboard on it it's
not the best it's not the worst it's got
their built-in overclocking I'm just
opening this up as quickly as I can here
because the most interesting about thing
about this notebook is actually nothing
to do with the shell but actually the
configuration inside so we're gonna grab
the battery because we will need that
for later so it comes with a battery
comes with a copy of dirt3 as well as
your utilities QuickStart guide manual
all that good stuff it comes with an
enormous power brick do the old iPhone
comparison oh actually the iPhone
comparison might not necessarily be
valid if I have it in a case so that's
how big it is you can go ahead and get a
better angle of that from the side maybe
to show them the thickness while I'm
sorting out other things over here so
yes it's an enormous power brick and the
reason for that is that while this is a
core i5 notebook that's actually fairly
high price this is a $1700 notebook at
retail what's cool about it is the fact
that it has a
ix 580 em inside
a 5 atm so why would you have a GTX 580
em with a core i5 dual core CPU and the
answer to that is because I thought it
was a good idea so I asked MSI based on
my request to create this view what
they've done is compared to other
similar models they have downgraded the
CPU from a quad core to a dual core that
is from an i7 2 and i-5 they have
downgraded the memory because normally a
system of this caliber that is about a
$1700 system would come with about 16
gigs around these days they have
downgraded the hard drive so instead of
going with dual hard drives in raid 0
which they are apt to do with with this
particular shell because it can hold 2
drives which is a very very cool feature
and so now you've got one empty drive
which you can throw an SSD in once you
out once you receive the notebook and
then they've used all of that extra
budget that we saved on all those other
things and upgraded the GPU to a 5 ATM
so what does this mean for the usage
model of this notebook well for one
thing don't buy this notebook if you're
a video encoder if you're a video editor
or if you're planning on doing any
serious 3d modeling work or anything
like that because the dual core is gonna
really slow you down even though it does
have hyper threading however if you are
a gamer this system is going to be
delightful because most all of the
downgrades that have been made to the
system are not going to really affect
games too much so yes we've gone to a
dual core CPU but it's clocked higher
and most games are still preferring to
use fewer cores at higher frequencies so
there's that the 8 gigs of ram is still
more than adequate for pretty much any
game that's out there right now although
you can upgrade it if you want
the additional graphics card firepower
is what's really going to deliver that
buttery smooth performance so what else
do we have here that I'm missing so it
has a map screen which is great so many
gaming shells come with glossy screens
these days because they are cheaper in
order to achieve the contrast that the
manufacturers are going for it is an LED
backlit panel as you know Wireless and
got your eco button Bluetooth Wi-Fi all
those intro it just turned on the Wi-Fi
fascinating all those interesting
features you can actually change I don't
know if it's gonna work now when we're
not booted up into the OS but you can
actually change the lighting effects so
you can turn on and off the ones that
are on the sides the ones that are on
the front and then the MSI logo I think
is lit all the time
here on the back we're gonna have a bit
of a closer look at the notebook itself
though so it's fairly thick although
this is probably about as small and thin
of a shell that you're gonna find a GTX
580 in at any point in time here's a
cool thing going along with their
Dynaudio better audio for notebooks
theme you've actually got dedicated 5.1
out ports which is very cool we've got
USB you got a DVD drive on the back you
find your power your Gigabit Ethernet
your VGA your eSATA your HDMI this is
the perfect combination I think because
you still do run into needs for VGA from
time to time but HDMI is smaller and
more compact and DVI so very convenient
you've got huge exhaust fans here and
here and you will need them the GTX 580
is a beast we've also got a USB 3 ports
2 of those an SD card reader another USB
2.0 port and then on the front we just
find some vents that they're not
actually vents they just have lights
behind them so they glow orange when you
set it to do so upgrading this notebook
is a piece of cake I've actually done it
on my channel I think and with this
particular shell not this skew but yeah
you can see one of your drives there so
you just take off this whole panel and
you can access your memory upgrades as
well as your hard drive and you can have
a look at that expensive fancy GPU that
you just spent a lot of money on because
a GTX 580 M is not cheap so thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at I never even told you the SKU
this is the GT 6 8 5 8 1 8
us oh he wants me to hold this up okay
sure
and it has an HD webcam which I didn't
mention yet and that's pretty much it so
this is this is as close to a custom
Lynas edition skew as it gets because
this ski was created based on my request
for a more balanced configuration so I
downgraded everything we didn't need and
I wanted to beef up the GPU as much as
possible to deliver the best possible
gaming experience on a notebook within a
sub $2,000 budget it's actually a few
hundred dollars less than that so we're
actually going to be testing it against
another notebook on my NCIX Clown
channel so you're gonna want to make
sure you're subscribed not only the
Linus tech tips for more unboxings and
videos like this but also NCIX comm so
you can see the showdown between this
one and the similarly expensive Asus
model with of GTX R 560 and a quad core
and lots of RAM and all that all the
other bells and whistles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
