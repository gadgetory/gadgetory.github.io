sent to me months ago and it
accidentally got buried under a pile of
cases with its factory tuning in data
center DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is
an amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts speaking of
which there is a link to our store in
the video description if you're logged
in to the forum you can check that out
and you can see that we're unloading
some products that we used for previous
videos on the cheap so definitely check
that out but anyway I finally dug it out
when I decided that I wanted to gain
more on my TV and I realized that my PC
qo7 wouldn't fit the kind of graphics
card I wanted for the best possible
experience the pc q 28 is quite a bit
larger than my older case but is still
small enough to fit in the cabinet under
my TV and it comes with some updated
features that make it both very easy to
build in and very functional let's start
with the outside if you've ever seen the
leanly case before then I don't need to
tell you that the fit and finish of
they're all aluminum cases is
exceptional and this one is no exception
to the exceptional nough sit
unexceptional I guess so it's good
though the brushed aluminum finish is
beautiful and every joint lines up
perfectly at the front you can install a
five and a quarter inch drive and I did
I happen to own one blu-ray a copy of
Disney's Enchanted so if I ever feel
like watching that I want to make sure
that I'm prepared true freaking story
not even joking about that and other
than that on the front it's just a
little lean Lee logo and the power
button on the right hand side we find
the front i/o two USB 3.0 ports a
headphone jack and a microphone jack and
then on the bottom we find a filtered
intake right there at the front for the
front 140 millimeter fan that is going
to bring fresh air to the inside of the
system on the left hand side we find not
a whole lot of anything and on the top
we find a 120 millimeter exhaust at the
back well two expansion slots so it
supports either I TX or D TX and then
power supply so that's pretty much it
opening up the side panel was
refreshingly simple rather than 6
tiny little countersunk screws leanly is
doing a sliding system with one screw
and then little plastic latches for the
rest of them much better much less
tedious to open up and much less likely
to cause you to lose something now the
first thing I'd like to say before we
get inside is that I am using a personal
build to showcase this chassis so some
of the hardware choices might seem a
little bit odd trust me I know alright
so now that it's opened up the first
thing I want to show you is actually
something that's not in there anymore
and that is this right here these two
thumb screws down here on the bottom
we're holding in this handy-dandy
bracket that accepts up to two two and a
half inch or two three and a half inch
drives I don't really need internal
drives because I'm using an as with I
scuzzy to install my games so I went
ahead and took this piece out in order
to give my graphics card a little bit
more breathing room here at the bottom
next up is the top hard drive cage which
I also removed to give that front 140
millimeter fan as much room to work as I
could this one accepts for three and a
half inch drives with a two and a half
inch drive hanging from the bottom so
that's a total of up to seven
mix-and-match internal drives in this
tiny little case now cable management
won't be super tidy if you do instead
decide to install that stuff so make
sure that your expectations are
reasonable but the good news is that it
doesn't have a windowed side panel so no
one will ever see it you can see what I
did is I remove that so that does give
me quite a bit more cable management
room although I don't have anywhere to
actually wrote those cables to your
power supply can be up to a hundred and
seventy millimeters in length but I'd
recommend a little bit shorter if you're
planning to use that drive cage or if
you're planning to use a modular power
supply and I'd also recommend picking up
a short cable kit Silverstone has some
great stuff for better cable management
I was on a budget when I first built
this media PC so I'm actually using an
an tech true power new 550 watt power
supply that I actually hacked all the
cables short on and then soldered them
back together reinsulated and reese
leave them it does improve cable
management but also makes the extra 6
pin PCI Express cable that I had to
attach
for my better graphics card with its
long wire on it look a little bit out of
place and really guys that's not
something that I would recommend doing
is just something that I did for this
particular build speaking of the
graphics card and the connector for it
I've got an open airflow gtx 660ti that
doesn't quite seem to be frauding in
this system but runs at a hundred
degrees under load in Far Cry 3 for that
reason I would prefer a rear exhaust
card but this one I was able to trade
Luke's friend something for so the price
was right there is lots of room in the
case to install something as big as a
GTX 780 Ti in there but based on how hot
this one's running even though it is an
open airflow design I don't think that
that's something that I'm going to do
without modding another intake or
something because that front intake does
have a 140 millimeter fan behind it but
the vent is quite small and and it's
it's definitely going to need more
airflow I mean one option would be to
take like a slim fan or even open up the
bottom of the case here to get some
better airflow and just throw like like
a dust filter or something on there and
then the other thing to consider to guys
is that your media cabinet is going to
get quite hot especially running games
with something like this inside of it so
but even now I'm going to have to get
like a 120 millimeter hole so I'll cut
some holes and then get some get some
airflow going on in there as well if we
take out the four thumb screws at the
back we can slide the power supply back
which allows us to see the gigabyte z87
ITX motherboard that i've got installed
in here the cpu and there's a core i5
45:17 on k it runs about 70 degrees in
my gaming load scenario in Far Cry 3 and
75Â° Mac's running prime95 small FFT
with the random silent X color that I
have on there I'm actually happy with
those results
I turned the fan around so that it feeds
directly into the power supply for
exhaust but I would definitely recommend
using a thermal probe to ensure that
your motherboard vrm temps are still
okay before doing something like that in
your own system normally your
motherboard should want to benefit from
the downdraft airflow that's coming from
your CPU fan the front connectors in the
system I don't know if you'll be able to
see this very clearly but that USB 3 one
in particular
is pretty taut yes the other ones were
okay but there's more strain on that USB
3 connector than I would have liked this
is an unusual spot on this motherboard
for the front header for USB 3 and the
front ports do work but another inch
would have made a really big difference
with the power supply popped out you can
also see my my super ghetto cable
cutting job here and how short the
cables on this power supply again I
don't really recommend doing that so if
we take off the other side panel you can
see that behind the motherboard tray we
find a very limited amount of space for
cable management and we also find my
boot drive it's a 1.8 inch 64 gig SSD
from Kingston this freed up some space
for me in the front for better air flow
which I desperately need given that you
saw my GPU temperatures and since I
don't really need any storage in this
machine 64 gigs is lots for my OS and
like the four internet browsers that I
need to have running at all times
so in conclusion overall I really like
this case I'm happy with it but I went
in knowing that I was trading proper
ventilation for physical beauty don't
expect to fill the PC q28 up with
everything that you can physically pack
inside and have it function seven drives
plus like a graphics card and it should
be noted that if you do install drives
on this bottom sled here you're not
going to be able to install a double
slot graphics card so even five drives
plus that graphics card it's just not
enough ventilation and you would have to
make some alterations to make that
happen so with that said I've definitely
still got some work to do on this bill
but I don't really think it's fair to
review the case
after I've modded it so I think we're
pretty much done here guys like and
