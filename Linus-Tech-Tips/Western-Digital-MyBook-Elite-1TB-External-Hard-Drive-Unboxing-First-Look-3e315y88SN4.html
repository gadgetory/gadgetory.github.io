my book elite this is an external hard
drive it is premium backup and storage
it it is the number one world's
best-selling external hard drives that
is WDS claim to fame on this particular
line well no I guess that's overall it
has a three year limited warranty it has
an LCD screen on the front it is secure
and I have no idea what that's supposed
to mean it's a brain with gears in it
but I guess we'll get to that when we
get to it so it's a one terabyte drive
that I have today it's up to 120 hours
of HD or 25,000 250,000 mp3s or 200,000
JPEGs ok yes I think that's just kind of
averaged visual backup ok so this is
their their LCD screen which can show it
has a power and activity light it has a
drive lock indicator so it locks and it
has a capacity dage so that's kind of
cool you don't have to monitor it you
can just monitor it at a glance
ok so visual backup 200 system files
music movies photos documents visual
backup displays your content categories
and confirms that your files have been
backed up ok that's kind of neat
mouse-over a category for an information
window with file details i actually know
nothing about this I'm just sort of
unboxing it on the spot here so they're
smart ware software's vidual Control
Center it gives you automatic continuous
backup it has password protection with
256 bit hardware encryption that's
pretty cool you have a smart display
custom label you can see your label
available capacity and security status
even when the drives unplugged that's
kind of a neat feature ok let's go
around to the other side and this shows
the drive itself so why don't we just
take it out and show you the drive
itself because this is meant to be
unboxed and that's what ow oh that hurt
ok I'm good I'm ok I'm alright
Oh hit my wrist on the table it's like
gonna bruise okay ah now I'm gonna try
and figure out how the box opens there's
a little tap okay our stickers cut the
stickers okay I gotta cut the stickers
the other way yes the stickers in every
direction possible there we go okay so
there it is there's the my book elite
and then over here is our accessories so
why don't we start with the accessories
let's see what we got inside here
I'm gonna guess there's power cord yes
success okay so here is an Asian power
devices 100 and 100 to 240 volt 50 to 60
hurt 0.5 amp 12-volt power adapter cool
and this is a power supply it's you can
conveniently labeled look at that
alright next we have what else we have a
USB data cable which is also labeled USB
2.0 oh this is this is kind of funny I
haven't seen too many three and a half
inch external hard drives that use the
little mini connector and most of them
seem to use the larger one but they're
yeah
and then we have a little pamphlet
brochure thing that says these and power
devices Inc and gives you some safety
instructions for the included AC to DC
power adapter clean only with a dry
cloth heat all warnings follow all
instructions do both of those things
keep these and these are okay this is
great
check this out okay one read these
instructions to keep these instructions
free heat all warnings for follow all
instructions and then they give you the
instructions so there's actually four
instructions out of 19 about reading and
keeping and following and heating all of
the instructions that's excellent next
we have an important note to Windows
users make sure that you follow all
these instructions also if it does not
launch automatically with my computer I
show you how to how to access the drive
my book elite this is a Quick Start
Guide so step
one two three one you plug in the power
two you plug in the data and three you
use your computer to use the Smart wear
software okay and there's nothing on the
back oh they they have a tech support in
case you have trouble with those three
instructions you can call tech support
in Spanish English to Japanese whole
bunch other languages have one phone
number in Middle East in Africa
okay technical support and warranty
kapow this is thick technical support
and warranty guide look at this thing
you could like hang this on the wall
I'm guessing it's because there are
umpteen billion different languages and
that seems to be the case so here's
English and then here's some more
English and I think that's all the
English so there must be actually that
many languages on here cool well it
looks like some of the languages get
diagrams and other ones don't if anyone
here someone should leave a comment and
tell me what this says because that
diagram isn't on there in English and
I'd like to know what it says this one
too actually
what does that say oh oh that's our OHS
so it's lead and mercury and cadmium all
that kind of good stuff okay so without
further ado why don't we have a look at
the actual unit okay so this is the
unbagging portion of my unboxing oh wow
these plastic things that they use are
very strong or I'm very weak one of the
two all right so it definitely weighs
about as much as a typical three and a
half inch drive which is about what
you'd expect here's the bottom so it has
two little rubberized foamy grippy feet
so if you put it down won't really slide
too much that's pretty good okay on the
side it has like a matte black finish
can you see the shininess cameraman sort
of okay good on the back this is where
you find most of the business end of
this particular device it's got a
Kensington lock I'm really happy to see
that then it's got a power button
there's your USB interface and there's
your power in okay this is all seems to
be ventilation so if you actually
look at it from this angle can you see
that you can kind of see into where the
drive is
can you tell okay yeah you can do you
can see that and then if you looking at
this angle on the top you can actually
see the top of the drive
so all these vent holes make sure that
the drive stays nice and cool oh and the
bottom is open too so it's going to use
natural convection to to let the heat
rise out the top and then come in from
the bottom that's kind of nice so at the
front there's our LCD screen and then
there's the power indicator LED just a
little tiny one you know what I like to
see that because you see so many
external devices with these obnoxiously
bright power indicators in fact the
camera man has a couple just like that
he's nodding to me and they can like
keep you up at night because they're so
bright then there's a wd logo and that's
pretty much all there is to it I mean
it's quite simple really the one thing
that I don't see is a disc for their
software I'm guessing it comes
pre-loaded and all you have to do is
plug it in which would stand to reason
we could try plugging it in but I think
that'll take too long why don't we do
that in a separate video thank you for
checking out my video blog on unboxing
