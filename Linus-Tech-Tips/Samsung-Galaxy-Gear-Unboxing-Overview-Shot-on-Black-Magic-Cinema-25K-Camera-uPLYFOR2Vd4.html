fully private click now to learn more so
guys were hands-on with the Galaxy gear
which as you can see if you were to
measure the luxurious nosov a watch by
the size compared to the pet no I'm just
messing with you guys it's not actually
that big so one of my big complaints
about smart devices is often the use of
microUSB however I actually love the way
Samsung's implemented this with the
Galaxy gear so it has a little charging
cradle that sits around it so this plugs
in via microUSB so you can see there's a
connector here on the back so that lives
on your nightstand because really the
device is good for about 24 hours of
battery life is about what they're
quoting so if you can get through a full
day then great and if you can get
through two days then see so much the
better if you're a very light user but
heavy users are expected to get a day
out of it so then once we've actually
taken that off I'll show you guys how
you adjust the strap now I'm gonna draw
a few sort of comparisons to the pebble
I recently got a pebble so I would
consider this to be more like the toyota
yaris of the SmartWatch sort of world
and I'd expect this to be more like more
like a Cadillac so we'll start with the
basics of what's out there right now so
hardware buttons as opposed to having a
touchscreen very sort of you know
rudimentary look and feel to it I kind
of regret ordering the orange one
because to me it feels kind of like the
sort of thing you a twelve-year-old
would wear has kind of a rubber strap
that comes with it out of the box but
the good news is you can change it now
let's go ahead and compare that to the
Galaxy gear so it has a 1.6 8 inch
AMOLED screen which is touchscreen and
support swiping in from different
directions so this enables a lot of
different functionalities I'm going to
go ahead and put it on hopefully I've
got it at the right size here that
should give you some idea how it looks
I'm personally not a huge fan of the
whole rubberized or plastic II watch
surface here and unfortunately unlike
the pebble you can't change it but
there's a good reason for that and
that's because there is functionality
built into the line I'm going to move
this again because apparently it's still
too big there's functionality built into
it so
not only does it have a microphone and
speaker that's built into the bottom of
the watch which will allow you to take
calls simply by holding your hand next
to your head which i think is sort of
debatable whether that's much better
than bluetooth sitting there and just
being walking around talking to yourself
talking to an empty hand but at least
you'll have at least you'll be
hands-free technically if you were
driving a car or whatever else so that's
one advantage to it and then there's
also a camera built into it does this
have the same kind of quality that you
might get with you know a companion
device such as the note three the answer
is obviously not but it does have the
advantage of being extremely quick to
activate so you can see the screen
turned itself on without me actually
pressing that loan button that's on the
side although you can turn it on
manually and a double click here will
launch an application of your choosing
depending on what you prefer so in this
case it is bound to s voice other than
that most of the navigation is done by
swiping up and down on the screen so the
defaults are swiping down opens up the
camera which allows you to quickly take
a picture you don't take a picture of my
camera tap to record tap again to stop
recording so it does support I think it
was 15-second video clips I'm getting
the nod from over there and then the
other main functionality that you can
access simply by swiping is the phone
functionality now other than that you
might go okay we'll honest that wasn't a
whole lot but you can swipe from side to
side and that actually gives you access
to a bunch of different cool stuff so
notifications are one of the big ones
whenever something comes in whether it's
a text or a phone call or whatever else
it's going to go to your phone but your
phone might be in your pocket or it
might be facedown on your desk or
whatever else the case may be this
notifications right here here we go
let's just open that up allows you to
see it and you can also see archived
notifications as well now this
particular one isn't configured right
now so we're not going to worry too much
about that s voice is another thing I
really see people using a lot with
something like the Galaxy gear because
obviously while it does have a touch
screen and while it does have a color
email LED screen you're not going to be
typing text messages on it that's
ridiculous
so if you were to dictate text messages
this is a great way to once again it
comes down to that driving or on-the-go
scenario it's a great way to be able to
use it without actually bringing out the
full size device now let's keep going
through here now there's going to be
customizable applications so we'll go
ahead there's voice memo gallery media
controller this is a big
one for me and while while the
implementation for me for the Galaxy
gear isn't as effective as the pebble
because tactile buttons are better so
when I'm riding on my motorbike I
actually have speakers wired up into my
helmet and I've been wishing for a way
to skip tracks easily without digging my
phone out of my pocket and touchscreen
will work for me when I'm wearing gloves
but the pebble does but if you don't
have that particular limitation and
you're not wearing gloves all the time
having a media controller just to skip
songs and pause and play is outstanding
you can check out your contacts logs you
can go to the camera manually settings
are in here but they're mostly going to
be configured through the companion
application that runs on the note 3
however I don't think I have it
installed on this particular one right
now anyway so we're not going to worry
too much about that and then there's the
apps so right now app support is about
as limited as phone support so you're
going to be able to use the Galaxy gear
with the note 2 the note 3 the s4 and
the s3 out of the blocks however Samsung
is committing support for additional
devices and not even necessarily just
Samsung devices so stay tuned for
updates that is again another advantage
of something that's more open like the
pebble where it does work with pretty
much anything but you don't get that you
don't get that tight integration one of
the things that they were demoing at the
reveal for the for the Galaxy gear as
well as the note 3 with simple things
like when you get a notification here
and you whip out your phone it's
automatically ready to go on the phone
itself and that type of integration
doesn't happen if you aren't using
devices from within the same family so
you have to decide basically it's down
to your personal preference do you want
something that's more open but is going
to have inherently more limited
functionality or do you want something
that is less open operates from within a
more closed ecosystem or more open
moving forward and gives you enhanced
functionality that you otherwise can't
get it's available and I believe it's
three different colors black white and
orange and it's going to be have an MSRP
of this is where it gets tricky again
over $300 here in Canada but with that
said a little bird told me that at
launch or potentially at other times who
knows what's going to happen down the
road you might be able to get bundles
with devices such as the note 3 which is
a perfect companion device for it and
save you know up to maybe even a hundred
dollars which brings
it down into a pricing where I'd go okay
so compared to the pebble I know I'm
drawing that comparison a lot but it's
the only SmartWatch I have so far so
I'll be able to talk more about it in
the future
but compared to something like that what
do you get you get well a faster
processor
well tangible processing power at all
you get a color screen you get an ID
that is a better out of the box but
perhaps less customizable and you get
that enhanced functionality with the
galaxy companion devices
I did say app support was a little bit
limited but that doesn't mean it's
useless so there's already Evernote
support and you can change things like
the watch faces although I haven't
played much around with this one in fact
I was going to have a device to take
away with me to do a full unboxing and
overview but this is pretty much all the
hands-on time I have with it here so
hopefully I'll be able to bring you guys
more information about it later thanks
for checking out this video on the
Samsung Galaxy gear something I'm
particularly excited about because I
mean I don't think there's really any
argument to be had about wearables being
