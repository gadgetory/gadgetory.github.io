far far away well actually it wasn't
that far away and it was in June of 2016
that AMD drop drop drop the RX 480
codenamed Polaris in a wild marketing
campaign evoking revolution and for good
reason the 400 series performed really
well for the price
although the flagship 480 was quickly
overshadowed by invidious 1060 haha the
dangers of shooting first but after 10
months of reloading AMD is finally ready
to fire again with the only question
being what's in the chamber firepower or
firepower
the phoenix auteur is a full-sized
minimalistic aliy designed keyboard
complete with Cherry MX switches and a
new white backlit variant check it out
at the link below
come on it's okay maybe it's not funny
but it's silly so let's get this out of
the way this is still Polaris the same
architecture AMD use for their rx 400
series if you were waiting for Andy's
highly anticipated Vega GPUs then you'll
be disappointed but if you were waiting
for Polaris enhanced with a more mature
14 nanometer FinFET process and tighter
voltage and frequency regulation
translating into better power efficiency
and higher clock speeds then you and all
the other holdouts with r9 285 or r9 380
s should be enough to sell right about
now well hold on a second here Linus
this is just a shinier 480 why is this
even worth the video and where is Vega
great question
Rx 570 and 580 then presumably due to
slumping rx 484 gig sales and these
partners will be putting more emphasis
on the top tier 8 gig version this time
around though that won't have much of an
impact on you the consumer and pricing
looks to be well basically the same with
rx 570 coming in $10 cheaper on average
than the 480 vedat replaces in other
news
AMD's slide deck also had prominent
mentions of both the rx 550 and rx 560
the former of which is brand new silicon
but we don't have those yet so all we
can say for now is that apparently the
rx 550 is better than an integrated GPU
at $80 and I would sure as hell hope so
and the 560 is a 460 but with a $10
price drop and
since enthusiasts were running around
unlocking extra compute units with BIOS
tricks
AMD went ahead and enabled those right
out of the factory and I guess there's
some software news as well as of the rx
500 series launch AMD's Radeon driver
for every card from 7000 series onward
includes what they're calling Radeon
chill a configurable frame limiter that
improves thermals and power draw when
enabled you can specify a minimum and
maximum frame rate and Radeon chill will
keep your game running within that
window eSports titles for instance are
designed to be easy to run and for that
reason they're notorious for ultra high
frame rates that go way beyond what a
typical or even very high-end monitor
would be able to display so what this
translates to for users is lower noise
and more consistent performance without
adding any input lag and in some cases
they claim even improving it pretty cool
right yeah call me when it's in a
notebook you guys also a bigger
supported games list would be swell so
to AMD's credit the big eSports titles
are mostly covered here alright then
Linus
enough stalling tell us how they are X
580 and 570 perform you guys are so
demanding sometimes you know okay so we
tested our shiny new cards on both our
Intel test bench and our rise in AMD
test bench along with equivalent last
gen cards from both AMD and NVIDIA now
since AMD doesn't have reference boards
for the 500 series they actually sent us
factory overclocked cards to test so
shout out to Asus and NVIDIA who
provided us with some factory
overclocked cards for the greenside to
level the playing field somewhat before
you ask by the way we did try
overclocking these cards further but
neither of them achieved a core
overclock of more than 50 megahertz over
what they already shipped with so then
as we can see in our perform
testing obvious things are indeed
obvious in fact we've got a measurable
if not earth shattering performance bump
over the RX 400-series directx12
and vulcan both show us a wider
improvement than DirectX 11
thanks to those AP is more efficient
rendering pipelines that favor
AMD's GCN architecture although again
the difference isn't that massive and
also of note here is the utterly
uninteresting differences in performance
between the cards across Intel and AMD
CPU platforms so sorry conspiracy
theorists but the rumors of Nvidia
drivers crippling rise in performance
seem to have been greatly exaggerated
so the TLDR then is that in a big
surprise to no one we're looking at a
higher clock rx 480 and 470 for this
release Andy chose to iterate on their
existing polaris architecture cards in
order to address some of their short
comings against invidious mid-range and
budget lineup have they achieved that
well as far as performance is concerned
yes yes they have when it comes to power
consumption the story does fall apart a
little bit particularly with these
factory overclocked cards though it
should be noted that we didn't use
Radeon chill for our testing because it
makes apples-to-apples comparisons go
sour so then if you're an AMD fan
desperately waiting to upgrade your
high-end Hawaii or Fiji based GPU then
you get to keep waiting but if you're
more of a mid-range buyer who didn't
know enough lawns last summer for a 470
or a 480 then great news because you get
a little bit more for your money this
year so rock on you sexy gardening beast
you so you're here
from your nephew or niece or whatever
that a VPN is a good idea and you go and
you look into it you're like what DNS
configuration port forwarding are you
kidding me
tunnel there takes all that crap out of
setting up a VPN for personal use you
download tunnel there it's available for
PC Mac Android iOS they even have a
Chrome extension you press like one
button and boom your internet connection
gets encrypted with AES 256-bit
encryption and you appear to the
websites and services that you want to
use online as though you are some
anonymous person from some other random
country allowing you to access services
that maybe you normally wouldn't be able
to they've got a top rated privacy
policy and they do not log your user
activity and the best part of all of
this is you don't have to take my word
for it you can try it for free with five
hundred megabytes of data and no credit
card required when you choose to get a
year of unlimited data you can even save
10% to by gonna tell bare comm slash LTT
so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but it
was awesome get subscribed hit the like
