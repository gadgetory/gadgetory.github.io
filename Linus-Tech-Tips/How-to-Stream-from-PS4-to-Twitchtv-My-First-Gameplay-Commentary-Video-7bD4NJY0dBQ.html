ready for anything
click now to learn more game streaming
online whether it's on console or PC
basically popped up overnight and it's
kind of a thing on the last gen consoles
it was mostly done through external
recorders such as pcs or dedicated boxes
but Sony has gone ahead and implemented
live broadcasting directly to twitch TV
directly on the PlayStation 4 console
saving gamers money and hassle this
video will be a guide for how to stream
from the ps4 and I guess also an
opportunity for you to enjoy my very
first gameplay commentary video on
youtube something and there's a dome wow
did you see the monitor that guy had and
these action figures this place is
awesome
I wish I had a monitor like that okay so
hold on I'm gonna see if I can find some
like bad guys to fight or something
beanbag chairs okay we got some plants
I'm pretty sure something really
exciting is gonna happen really soon
this is uh you know my very first
gameplay video and is that guy on his
phone is he even working this is
supposed to be an office and these guys
look like they're getting hammered and
that other guy over there is just like
on his phone so all right I'm gonna go
like report them to their boss or
something let's see if I can find his
office and then there's this guy well
this guy it he has a Bluetooth thing in
his in his ear he's got a Bluetooth
thing in his ear and he's holding a
phone up to his head I think he's a spy
I think I'm gonna follow him where's he
going now what what is this oh yeah oh
yeah super inconspicuous all right well
we're going to be ready for this I'm
going to be broadcasting this so all you
got to do is go to broadcast gameplay
select twitch then you go to the twitch
website don't worry it doesn't just open
up a browser gives you a couple of
options here so you can go ahead and you
can create a new account
I personally already have a twitch
account so I'm just going to go to login
where I can enter my twitch TV username
as well as my twitch TV password which I
have of course completely blacked out
here guys because stealing my twitch TV
password is not going to be a thing
so once I'm logged in I've got a few
different options I can include yes I
can include a little video of myself in
the corner if I happen to have a
PlayStation camera I can include
microphone audio in my broadcasts and I
can display comments on the screen or
not display comments on the screen so
that'll be from the twitch chat I can
also change the channel name when I'm
broadcasting and I can post a link to
Facebook because I use Facebook actually
I don't use Facebook but what I will do
is I'll change the name of my stream to
test stream or something like that so
that people have some idea what's going
on although they probably still won't
know what's going on then what we can do
is we can go into broadcast settings and
you can manage your account information
set up the quality from you know low to
medium to hide to best you can change
some of the same settings that we saw on
the screen before yay
then when we're done that all we got to
do is go down to start broadcasting and
we're ready to rock all right so let's
watch this guy here he's getting some
like coffee or water or something I see
him giving me the shifty eyes he knows
I'm on to him look at that look at look
at it the cops are not even touching his
lips there isn't even anything in it
look at that he tips it over before what
is he even doing he tipped it before it
got to his mouth then he maybe if we get
it out of the garbage can we can get
some clues all right Mike don't want to
let him get away oh I can run and he
can't that'll be a big advantage
that'll be key for later let's see if he
does anything else suspicious here Dan
tan tan-tan tan tan-tan tan tan-tan tan
tan-tan tan tan-tan Tata ah yes oh hey
cool check that out okay so guys you can
actually see a little bit of information
over on the right there you can see
there's 20 people watching the stream
and a couple people have commented on it
in fact I guess there are some more
comments now because people are indeed
confused by my test spy stream named
Yamuna yes you are indeed on TV your
mother would be proud so I really hope
that we don't get anything showing up
here that's not appropriate for
broadcast to my my youtube child hold on
a second he's doing it again he's doing
it again look he's holding a phone he's
got a bluetooth earpiece in
he's a bad person well I think we're
pretty much done here so thank you guys
very much for checking out my first ever
game commentary video i'ma stop
broadcasting now and I'll see you back
in my normal habitat
now while gameplay archiving on twitch
TV isn't supported on ps4 right now it
will be coming in the meantime if you
want to archive your footage and/or edit
it on a PC you will need a couple of
things number one is an HDMI splitter
that removes the HDCP protection from
the gaming stream these splitters aren't
illegal but some of the things you can
do with them are so be responsible and
number two is a capture device such as a
more traditional PC capture station or a
standalone device that records to flash
memory such as an AVerMedia live gamer
portable or Game Capture HD 2 these
setups allow for full 1080p recording
I'd like to thank you guys for watching
my very first you know whatever we would
call that video that was in the middle
of this one and I'd also like to thank
twitch TV for being the ones to provide
us with a Playstation 4 the one that we
used for our console PC image quality
comparison in exchange for us simply
doing a guide on how to stream from ps4
to twitch TV which is something that I
suspect a fair number of you are
interested in anyway like the video if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it leave a comment if you have anything
else to express to us and as always
