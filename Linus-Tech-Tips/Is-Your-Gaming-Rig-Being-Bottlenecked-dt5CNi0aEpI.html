ooh this looks pretty good now I just
need a graphics card to pair it with
right mmm well this looks to Pinner
this is probably gonna bottleneck my CPU
but then this huh this is probably over
the top it might like destroy it just to
be in close proximity to it but I mean
how do you keep from bottlenecking
your CPU with your GPU and then do you
have to worry about picking the right
CPU for the GPU can it work both ways
what is a balanced build even look like
these days good thing we've got all the
tools to find out
when I say bottleneck what comes to your
mind is it super laggy unplayable frame
rates and games is it waiting five
minutes just to load windows is it the
neck of a bottle whatever your exact
experience with bottle necks is they all
have one thing in common like a
five-lane highway merging before a
single lane tunnel one aspect of your
computer system will be holding back
another one keeping it from reaching its
full performance potential so
bottlenecking has become one of the most
common fears among new pc builders I
mean after all no one likes wasting
money so are these concerns legit or has
bottlenecking
become some sort of boogeyman for system
builders to deter new users from
configuring their own we were actually
inspired to make this video by the
incredible bottlenecking that we
experienced when we tried to game on
this right here a 64 cores Xeon Phi
system but that was obviously an
unrealistic scenario I mean this CPU is
made up of 64 like crappy atom
processors so today's investigation will
test just how badly we can bottleneck a
more normal system built from actual
desktop components so in front of me
here is a lower end current gen CPU a
popular but pretty obsolete CPU from
2013 and a high end current generation
processor we're gonna start then with
the most basic of our graphics cards a
gtx 1030 this will help us establish a
baseline now I'm actually expecting
similar performance in games going all
the way from a mid tier processor from
five years ago all the way up to the
brand-new one that would indicate a GPU
bottleneck where it's holding back our
better CPU
and success I guess because we're
basically even across the board
surprisingly csgo actually runs really
well on this card averaging over a
hundred and twenty FPS for all of our
benches but what's less surprising is
the way that in a gaming workload an
underpowered graphics card will perform
its best pretty much regardless of which
CPU it gets paired with so you heard it
here first folks a processor upgrade
will do nothing for your gaming
experience if your GPU can't keep up
with that said 3d creation software
blender reveals a difference between our
platforms demonstrating that whether a
system is bottlenecked or not is heavily
dependent on the type of work you plan
to do on it now then let's retest
everything with a gtx 1060 and see how
the situation changes right away
we're greeted with oh good a difference
so the core i7 pulls way ahead in
Assassin's Creed origins and csgo and
3dmark confirms this data with a much
nicer spread between our platforms which
means then that our more powerful
processors are getting to stretch their
legs a little more because they're not
being held back to the same degree but
wait it appears as though the gtx 1060
is still the bottleneck for deus ex and
far cry 5 this is where our second
lesson about bottlenecks comes in it can
even be dependent on the individual
piece of software with some games
favoring faster CPUs and others needing
more GPU horsepower in order to look
their best coming back around then to
our non-gaming tests the results
confirmed that productivity still likes
a fast CPU to keep the GPU fed ok then
so that's probably quite enough of these
blue-collar GPUs where the devil
Titan V James James is running something
on the Titan V right now so we're going
to use this Titan V box this gtx 1070
and this gold sharpie marker to create a
reasonable facsimile of a titan v here
we're expecting some pretty different
results and yes we have finally broken
the GPU bottleneck on deus ex and our
Rison 3 is definitely beating out the FX
6350 for the first time in far cry 5
showing us what an optimized title can
do unfortunately blender still doesn't
run on the Titan V so we're just left
with v-ray which doesn't scale bringing
us to our last test scenario dropping
our monitors resolution down to 1280 x
1024 on that very same Titan v test
platform and oh what's this
interesting even with a Titan V we're
back to CPU bottlenecking ah yes the
final lesson is that bottlenecks will
also appear and disappear depending on
the settings that you're using in your
program lower resolution gaming is
easier on the graphics card but actually
doesn't ease the CPUs job to nearly the
same degree and higher resolution gaming
is harder on the graphics card but since
that drives the framerate slower the CPU
doesn't end up having to work as hard so
if your gaming system was severely CPU
bottlenecked you actually might be able
to upgrade your monitor and play at a
higher resolution without losing any fps
go figure so really the main takeaway
here is that there
is no way to avoid bottlenecks
altogether think about it a theoretical
system with no bottlenecks would have
unlimited performance in every workload
because nothing would be a limiting
factor obviously that's ridiculous
something is always going to hold you
back and you can't get paralyzed by the
bottleneck boogieman as you've seen here
as long as you apply some common sense
to your config and avoid pairing
30-dollar CPUs with $3,000 graphics
cards you should be just fine and you
can always ask for advice like maybe
over on the Linus tech tips for them
about where the bottleneck might be in
your system and how severe it might be
just make sure to provide some
information about what you expect to use
your PC for and what kind of settings
you expect to run at or as you can see
it's gonna be pretty hard to help you so
thanks for watching guys if this video
sucked you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like

buy the stuff we featured in the video
description also down there's our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should definitely join so you can get
