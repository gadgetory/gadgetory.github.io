personal rig update and the last one
kind of fell flat anyways it was a
rushed plan you guys didn't really like
it and admittedly I wasn't really into
it either
ever since moving away from the mineral
oil build the choice of case has been a
difficult one
I even opted for trying to go with just
a test bench because I was so
unsatisfied with what was currently
available on the case market I didn't
want a big gaudy case I did want
something that could fit an ATX
motherboard however because I like
expansion slots I wanted it to be clean
but not happy-go-lucky Martha Stewart
clean more like that looks nice but also
scares the absolute out of me Adam
Jensen style clean I wanted angles I
wanted tempered glass and I wanted
quality construction I think I may have
finally found the platform that I was
looking for and because of that I'm
going to be hard on it it's time to
review the end to evolve ATX TG
the sound course Port Excel from Ankur
is an ip67 rated Bluetooth speaker
featuring 15 hours of playtime 16 watts
of audio output and the USB charging
port for your devices check it out at
the link below the front face features
the beginning of the angular design my
case came in anthracite gray but is
available in silver and black variants
as well somewhat near the bottom of the
indented section of the faceplate is an
LED bar and at the top there's a flip
cover which reveals dual USB 3.0 ports a
headphone and microphone jack and an RGB
LED changing button which allows you to
cycle through the 10 available colors
for the integrated LEDs and additional
LEDs added on later in the form of a fan
Tech's LED strip but this is where I'm
going to get quite nitpicky for an ATX
case I would have liked to see more USB
ports up front 2 more USB type a ports
as either USB 2.0 or 3.0 alongside a
little bit of modernization with the
inclusion of a USB 3.1 type-c connector
would have been ideal it also looks like
it would have been entirely possible
with a denser configuration of ports the
front plate is removable by simply
leveraging the bottom and then the
revealed fan filter is able to be
removed by the handle at the top or by
the squeezed mounts on the inside of the
case it does start a little too tight
but after you remove it a few times it
gets a bit easier to use just the handle
the side panels are both made of
tempered glass meaning your right side
panel which is normally hiding your
cable management is now quite naked the
fan Tech's mounting solution for their
tempered glass is admittedly the best I
have personally used because they
relentlessly built buffers of foam or
rubber between contact points that could
scratch the glass this includes foam
padded thumb screws rubber wrapped
female thread points and a foam lined
interior that the glass squeezes against
it would have been wonderful if they
could have used the same mounting method
they had used for the non tempered glass
version of the Evolve because the
screwless swivel mount was fantastic but
I understand going this direction
because you don't
mess around with tempered glass if this
stuff shatters it's one hell of a job
getting it all cleaned up the top of the
case features your power button and some
speed hole inspired venting along the
angled sides with some great-looking
mesh underneath the whole panel can be
done away with by removing two screws at
the back and two screws at the front
panel and then simply popping it off
moving inside the case you have a nicely
rail mountable radiator and fan install
area up in the top but it's kind of
unfortunate how far down that radiator
and fan setup would go covering up the
top of your motherboard because of this
I would go with what I usually consider
the less visually optimal position of
the front which by the way has a
removable panel so you can extend
radiators down into the basement of the
case putting a triple radiator up here
and removing that panel will also remove
your ability to use any of the modular
drive mounts and the dual three and a
half inch drive bay mounting area in the
bottom so essentially you're stuck with
three 2.5 inch positions two of which
are on the back of the motherboard tray
and one of which is beautifully
displayed in the main compartment on the
side of the basement the back of the
motherboard tray features a fan
controller which is a nice addition but
due to it being exposed through the
glass I would have appreciated some type
of cover to make it more aesthetically
pleasing the three velcro cable
management straps are a wonderful touch
but I would have appreciated them being
just a little bit longer as they seem to
just barely be able to hold on with some
of the more populated runs and I don't
even have that much stuff installed and
adding on to that some form of zap strap
loop or something would have been
appreciated for managing the 8 pin CPU
cable along the right hand side because
right now there's nothing inside the
main area of the case you have the
snugly fit ATX motherboard a cool angled
panel where your cables can come out of
through the rubber grommets and some
unfortunately not somehow covered or
grommeted cable management holes for the
bottom of your mount motherboard add-on
slots and SSD mount you can fit three
120 or 140 millimeter fans in the front
and top of the case and one 120 or 140
millimeter
and in the back that removable panel up
near the front for the tall radiators
can also facilitate a panel that will
aid in installing pumps or reservoirs if
that's your thing as well then there is
a cutout that reveals the side of your
power supply speaking of which I would
have preferred that fantex had a
different mounting solution for this
that enabled you to slide the power
supply in through the back of the case
using something like a removable bracket
okay so conclusion time I was hard on it
I nitpicked things that I would have
never even mentioned on other cases and
this was out of love from titanium grade
sandblasted anodized coatings which look
absolutely stunning while allowing you
to touch it without having a heart
attack to the refreshing ease of the
entirety of the build process down to
the little things like including a
surprisingly nice spare screw box it's
great
goldstar that's why I'm going to use it
for my personal rig the video of which
will come at some point I'm still
working on getting the internals so yeah

guys for watching sorry it took so long
for any mention at all of my personal
rig updates I know this isn't really
much of one considering all of the
internals and a lot of the other stuff
is going to change because I going to
need to mod it for it to be a really
good personal rig update but anyways if
you liked it like it you just liked it
dislike it get subscribed if you want to
see future updates on this thing we have
a bunch of shirts that you can pick up
which are great at the link in video
description down below check out the
forum become a member
more members on there is cool it's not
really growing that fast anymore because
I think we hit some form of like real
to peak but the community is great and
that is cool we want to see a cool video
on a mineral oil rig that I built a long
time ago for myself and which helped me
get this job click here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
