and welcome to the Wynn show we're
technically here get this out of my face
yeah but no I want it in my face put it
in my not letting me remove it once you
put it in my face you got to leave it
there
oh please for a little while let me
savor it all right so we've got a great
show for you guys today I think I
actually have no idea at me neither it's
been off to a pretty rough start to be
perfectly honest I can't even check if I
wanted to yeah
Luke's got an update that's sitting at
23% thank you dual-core laptops yeah I
am so glad that as of 8th gen you're
gone forever
did someone who someone raised your
chair again doing it but from people
like when people come on when show they
need to just not dink around with
anything or did they not that's it well
why is it framed like this did someone
mess with mine you know what forget it
who cares ah your chair is too low
chatter yo creator suspended after being
arrested for child exploitation um yeah
I know well like mine too now let's just
I'm calling max I'm so I'm somebody
reacts beautiful show the best show
um okay no further details yet other
than the other details that we have that
will tell you about later AMD suggests
that mining may be profitable on thread
Ripper I don't even I don't even
laughing cuz I like know that it isn't
or that it is it's just like please
miners buy our stuff to buy more of our
stuff miners yeah he has so much money
please all right Elon Musk released a
flamethrower
you know what's called the boring
company yeah alright so we'll talk about
that later I guess yeah and Apple sells
fewer iPhones but profits rise wow this
is some boring boring stuff I'm so
interested in Apple making lots of money
we'll find out other things to talk
about I guess
so I had you lower it max but I think
what ultimately happened with someone
adjusted my chair height because Luke
said my head is bit about the same
height because we're me
that I'm not so
we can't see it no I do not want an
Apple box to sit on what are you Brandon
no no bad new Brandon why just slouch a
bit terrible welcome to the wine shop oh
man still at 28% it's gonna go like the
whole show I'm not even gonna have a
laptop for the show today oh man you
know what I would I would even say it's
been that kind of week but it actually
hasn't it's been an okay week I actually
had an okay week yeah well you know no
wait hold on a second I forgot about all
the drama at the beginning of the week
what with the whole yeah you know about
game right I was a late comer okay cuz I
night I had no idea I had no idea was
happening while it was happening yeah
and I was like just cruising through
flow plane to make sure everything was
going good and I saw like you were like
what I'm this way this come Flynn no I
saw like that thread and I was like I'm
confused and then I watched like two
minutes of it and was like I don't have
time for this and I don't care and then
I scrolled down and was like most the
comments don't seem to care oh oh on our
side on our side
yes yeah and then I heard about the
tweet and then I was like wow and then I
moved on yeah it totally blew up um a
lot of people have sort of asked me for
comments but I hope I've said pretty
much everything no no it's that's the
schedule shot to know I've said pretty
much everything I have to say in an
unlisted livestream that you should have
gotten for notifications about I was so
mad like it's so mad okay I have a 15
megabit up connection at home I am I've
watched that part down the hall from
$1,000 access point which said those of
you who've been watching a long time
know that I used to have a lot of issues
with Wi-Fi so eventually finally just
like about three years ago I was like I
am so done with this like what gives me
more satisfaction in my daily life
another graphics card for SLI no or
Wi-Fi that works all the time I think
I'm gonna do by the way I think I might
do another wTF is going on with this
live video really because I think it
almost needs an update more that much
it's like neither of them want to
support it AMD's like No completely in
videos like sort of - other than that no
Nvidia likes people putting two graphics
cards in their system honestly I think
for them it's less even about the money
and more about just like that a GPU is a
status symbol yeah but the game
developer support is basically
non-existent and before the I don't know
why we're talking about this I guess
there's no good topics we might as well
before the mentality from the the
hardware guys seemed to be that they
just show up to your development studio
before your game came out would be like
no you now support SLI and crossfire
yeah and then now they just don't and
because they're not there isn't support
for you I don't know it's it's been a
terrible experience like Assassin's
Creed origins if you ran with SLI
enabled the game would run it would just
run way worse than it would have ran
otherwise it's like completely not the
experience that you should have I don't
know its benefits but it's been rough
for the multiple graphics card guys and
the future doesn't look any better at
all yeah so I don't remember where we
how we got onto this topic you were
talking about this the you preferring
having like a sweet AP versus this
weekend yeah so I decided that Wi-Fi was
actually more important to me than a few
frames per second so I got a baller
access point so I was streaming through
the YouTube app on a pixel to excel so I
was as Google as I could possibly be and
I sent out and that interesting part I
managed to send out three notifications
to people each time I went live which
three each time no no one each told you
three one for each time I went live and
then the streams would just stop I got a
I got a screen grab of actually you know
like an unhappy face I can probably grab
it but yeah like it would just give me
this error and be like yup
your stream is down wah-wah
it doesn't seem to have uploaded so
that's my thumbnail I know yeah it's
just the day I wrote I couldn't I roll
enough I actually tried to I roll more
that was the most that was the most that
I could physically roll my eyes but I
just got this your stream has failed
message and and it would just stop and
then what I've discovered now is that
you can't you have no way of undoing
those notifications that are sitting in
people's feeds so I was getting messages
from people for the next couple days oh
babe screenshot these for notifications
on the road they'd be like wTF is this
I'm just kind of sitting here going I'm
sorry I can't reply to every single one
of you I don't like it either
trust me it's dumb but I can't do
anything about it so I finally streamed
on the iPhone 10 instead and it works
perfectly that's like something like if
you're if you're twitch streaming and
say OBS crashes are you yeah pewter blue
screens or something and you need to go
Twitter stream again yeah it sends the
email version of the notification to
everyone I disabled the auto tweet one
because of that on like most like ours
doesn't do it mine doesn't do it most
people that I hope it doesn't do it
anymore yeah but it will still email
everyone and people still get the phone
notification right so it's pretty yeah
it's pretty frustrating like it would be
nice to have it you know be resumable or
something like it yeah especially
because the app itself didn't crash it
was just like your stream is stopped and
I understand I do understand that
whether it's down to you know codecs
requiring files to be closed out or
whether it's down to any number of
reasons that it's actually not like
trivially simple I do get that but there
has to be a better system than what we
have now especially if you stream for
like one minute and then you stream
again like I would I would I would like
for it to be a little bit smarter than
that
um so anyway I said pretty much
everything I had to say there you guys
can check that out if you want you
probably have a notification if you're
subscribed but in a nutshell people were
mad because I confused attempt
and a pad because the title said tampon
okay in the thumbnail is holding a pad
yeah we probably shouldn't move probably
should we get into it because all we
stand to do all we stand to gain is more
articles on Mashable Daily Mail really
and some yeah oh yeah like there are
there are like articles about about this
controversy that I'm kind of sitting
here going okay like I guess I guess
that's a thing that we need to write
about today okay I'm just gonna no
comment let's move on
yep so I don't even want to cover this
first topic either what's the first
topic today the counter-strike thing
oh yeah there's not really a lot to say
well no it specifically says was not
charged yeah a crime so I don't really
want to cover it because we're just like
throwing the student to the bus when he
wasn't charged with a crime maybe if
anything concrete comes out of it yeah I
don't like the idea of just throwing his
name into the bus when he's not arrested
suspended bivalve yeah suspension
they're probably waiting til the okay
statement from valve suspended from the
developer while the company investigates
does not have a criminal history so in a
nutshell we're not gonna name any names
it doesn't look like anything's really
happened here but one of the co-creators
of Counter Strike has been arrested and
suspended from valve and there's what's
weird is that he's been arrested but not
charged with a crime and the police
didn't say if an actual child was harmed
he has no criminal history and of course
the local news station is speculating as
to you know what this might mean but no
one has actually indicated that they
know exactly what's going on here so
let's move into oh man
why would AMD even bring this up so this
article from PC games and calm what does
this mean for AMD's reputation that's an
interesting thing for me because so many
gamers right now are really upset
about lack of stock of parts about
prices of things going up and the person
or the group that everyone loves to hate
is theoretically fighting against that
at least in statement I don't know
outside of that yeah but NVIDIA has
stated at least I don't again I don't
know outside of that they might be doing
something I don't know if they are or
not that they that they are trying or
they want game works to still be able to
buy graphics cards and stuff AMD I don't
think I stated anything about graphics
cards as far as I know I could be
ignorant on that topic it's not like my
laptop's working right now like several
minutes yeah you bet it will but but is
actively encouraging people to buy CPUs
remaining so they're trying to
potentially crush the other side of the
market and right now with everyone being
mad at like what is it Micro Center or
something I don't know because they're
like bundling GPUs with whole platforms
but if you buy the whole platform you
get the GPU at MSRP okay sure
but like if you don't you get it at a
cranked up price right yeah so it makes
it tough for upgraders but that's but
then upgraders are a huge part of the
market because ya don't have to upgrade
your CPU that often yep
so anyway the what leads up what leads
you know we should probably strawpoll
this but what led us to this
conversation is that AMD's technical
marketing manager Damian trill it
believes that there's massive potential
for home mining rigs with their thread
Ripper CPUs and there's a few details
here let's go through the like stuff
that was said first and then we'll get
into all the problems with this because
there are some so kryptonite can be
mined with CPUs that have about 2 Meg's
of level 3 cache per mining thread 3
cache is important for CPU money yeah so
this rules out almost all ASIC mining
machines that are so far in production
but favours CPUs with high level 3 cache
per core which thread Ripper is designed
for ok so he also said CPUs could be
acceptable for mining if they could
handle very few threads very fast and
that's exactly what thread repair is
able to do Fredrick fir comes with up to
32 Meg's of level 3 cache and it can
keep the data set in cache which speeds
up crypto mining a lot
blah blah blah so with 2 Meg's per
thread a thread refer 1950 ax could run
around 15 active mining threads not bad
that would allow it to get in about the
same ballpark as our X Vega and it will
be much faster for example this is all
quoting them much faster than a 1080 TI
for example in kryptonite h2 Intel's a
DDT chips have far less level three
cache per core so he believes that a
thread Ripper could be capable of
accumulating around $90 a month through
the nice hash mining program though of
course let me just check my handy dandy
how much has the market fallen yeah you
know calculator here and it's dropped
honestly this is not reflective of what
happened yesterday so somewhere in the
neighborhood of like 30 plus percent in
the last couple of days so your mileage
may vary
now of course and also go back up I
could go down 80% more I heard something
happened last January as well so there
could be a seasonally sure it's every
January yeah there could be a seasonal
element to this but or there might not
be who knows
maybe every other January was just a
coincidence and maybe this one is - or
maybe this is the end of times who knows
the end of mining anyway so using his
estimated earnings a thread ripper 1920
x would see a return beyond its own MSRP
of around seven hundred and sixty
dollars in just under nine months so oh
yeah I'm not reading games you have to
do it you do it is ambi trying to cash
in on that cryptocurrency
CA CH e okay so penny problem number one
is the perception problem yeah do I
think that's huge because you look at
how many people were mad about the piece
that we did on cryptocurrency mining
what was it a week ago two weeks ago
something like that did you check out
mining adventure part two part three
yeah part two you don't want the GPS
I've seen all okay you've seen all of
them so mining adventure part two cool
rough
we covered building a more optimized to
GPU mining machine and that got 40,000
likes which is pretty good Wow
but also 10,000 dislikes yeah cuz the
gamers so just over a fifth of you guys
were mad enough that on a piece of
content that I thought was pretty good
whether you like mining or not I thought
it was interesting Jake did a lot of
research on this one he ended up with a
pretty cool rig pretty optimized
configuration anyway people were so mad
that we got a fifth of you like pressing
the dislike button to show your
dissatisfaction with us even covering
the stuff and there's 8,000 comments on
it 1000 I don't know who they should be
mad at well okay I know at least one
group that they should be mad at outside
of that I don't know if they should or
should not be mad at other groups
yeah but gamers I understand the GPU
market is terrible right now that's
crazy I would not want to be building
computer I wouldn't build a computer I
tweeted out like way before the whole
internet made articles about it and then
some people were like oh they copied you
it's like no they didn't but whatever
I stole sure they figured it out
independently yeah yeah it's a pretty
common thought but buying consoles right
now yeah is like actually if you just
want a game a pretty decent it's like
not a bad bet yeah and the crazy thing
is you look at how quickly this happened
oh because if you go back to mining
adventure part 1 which it was fine
backed by many accounts or by our by a
lot of accounts is a worse video yeah
because we we did not try to build
something optimized we actually went at
it from a completely unauthorized way
it's amazing by the way was the boy it's
amazing how many comments there are on
that video about how poorly optimized
the build is even though we said it
right in the video the top was what
exactly what we were doing it's amazing
how many people try really really hard
to not understand a video anyway so that
had 50,000 likes and just 1600 dislikes
that's about 97% and then this one's
closer to 80
so the whole public perception was like
this is okay and then this is suddenly
not okay so that's gonna make sense from
mid-november to mid-january two months
and the perception changed that much
around GPU mining well it went from like
where I think is a good spot for it to
be which is like Oh gamers you can like
make some more money doing this yeah and
like if you if you have a couple GPUs
around or you want an excuse to play
with hardware and buy some more graphics
cards you can do this it went from that
to like dawn good in a warehouse to
remember and then people got really
upset about that right okay the solution
Linus coin did you see Jake's tweet no
he's saying instead of float coin we
should call it sync coin st. Croix sync
sync is the market syncing and because
of its same coin because you should sync
your investment into it all of it we
really really all of it yeah
so so I think we've pretty much decided
we have kind of talked about it a little
bit to be clear when Luke initially
brought it up total joke in Paul's video
not even talked about at all
pure troll you still don't want to call
it pure troll let's know we don't have
to okay okay um but we've talked about
it we're gonna do a coin and we're gonna
do it as part of mining adventure and
the point that we're going to be trying
to make is them and I really want you
guys to listen really carefully just
turn off the radio do kids don't listen
to the radio anymore turn off the
whatever else it whatever audio noise
pollution you have around you off the
twitch memes listen really carefully we
are creating this video to demonstrate
how a coin can be created for purely
exploitative purposes because a lot of
them are because a lot of them are we
will be going through the procedure and
showing you guys how it is done and
we'll be listing like a lot of the
different ways that it could be done and
then we'll be picking a few yeah and
we'll be going that route yeah well do
you guys want so if you guys decide to
mine it
by all means - if you guys decide to buy
some by all means do it but let me tell
you guys right now our coin aside from
if we can find some purpose for it where
you can like use it for voting on
weighing Shores voting on land show or
like some kind of access to a special
sub forum on the forum or whatever like
we might come up with like a couple a
couple LMG or floatplane related things
you can do and those would largely be a
part of the experiment of getting people
to use it actually but expect it to
crash because in the long term we do not
have either the technical know-how or
the inclination to follow this through
and make it a technologically superior
coin which is yeah it won't be we're
just work someone else's thing dude do
no special advancements to it yes and
run forward yes so expect it to be that
which is coming now I realize I talked
for a really long time so if anyone
tuned out here's the bottom line if you
didn't listen till there everything I
just said don't mind any and don't buy
everybody got that yes okay that's good
all right now it's time for our sponsors
hold on one quick thing if I want to
know
CPU mining I believe I believe you FD
Tech has done a video on like is it
worth it I don't know if we're gonna go
down that road actually haven't I wanted
to talk about a few things to do with
this okay after after these messages
from our sponsors we're gonna talk about
a few things from them no way
what up oh these are cool it comes with
swappable the kids ones oh ok nevermind
I thought it was like just purple and
for at all yeah so those those can come
off easily and though they Bend easily
and they won't break and all that
alright so spectrum glasses my friends
spectrum glasses are all about keeping
that blue light out of your eyes staring
at a monitor all day can be hard on your
eyes over time and make it tougher to
fall asleep so compared to a software
solution
chum gives you better filtering of blue
light features include that they are
stylish and you guys can check out their
site they've actually got tons of
different styles to choose from they're
high quality they come with a one-year
warranty and they have low color
distortions so the idea is to block
high-energy blue light while keeping
colors as similar as possible to be very
clear you're still gonna have to flip up
your glasses if you wanted to do some
like color accurate work but if you're
reading text or working on spreadsheets
or PowerPoint presentations or whatever
the case may be you won't be sitting
there working on it with your spectrum
glasses and then like you know save it
and walk away and then go to present it
to someone you're like oh that's
supposed to be red it's orange not gonna
be a thing they're primarily focused on
the Canadian and US markets but they are
expanding to Europe oh that's cool
and they offer international shipping
check out at Spectrum glasses comm slash
collections slash pro spec or click this
link and use offer code Lynas to save
10% I'm going to copy that link into the
twitch chat so you guys can go check
them out and you can look almost as cool
as me almost I'm wearing big headphones
around my neck which makes me look super
cool that was a thing drew I know why
was that a thing why I know why because
it beats by dre why were those a thing
why are they still a thing actually I've
heard the latest ones are pretty good I
haven't actually tried them I suspect
Apple might improve them oops there's
this bit you know I don't know I think
apples bar for audio is like good enough
and clearly when they Bobby a brand it
was already good enough was it
well the solo twos are apparently pretty
good oh I don't know tell Harrison's
likes them the only ones I've tried were
garbage but I've only tried like one or
two pairs I only tried the OG ones yeah
and they were awful yeah I did like the
really old-school black and Red's right
I remember I remember trying to talk one
of my old colleagues at NCIX out of
buying them like I I did my video on
them and he was like yeah so like I want
to buy them but it's a lot of money
they're like $400 it's a lot of money
are they any good and I'm like no and
he's like well I mean they look really
cool
and I just like I thought maybe they'd
be pretty good and I was like they're
not and he's like well I was just like I
mean maybe they're like good enough and
I'm like they're not good and you need
to change the batteries like every other
day so they're not good there's a change
that they weren't charged didn't work at
all they didn't work at all without the
batteries to triple A's okay yeah and he
was like yeah you know I'm just gonna
get them and I'm like why do I even that
was the point where I realized that no
matter what I say in these videos people
are just gonna do whatever it is that
they're gonna do like it's actually
amazing how little influence that I have
as an influencer yeah and on that
subject Squarespace

ebooks.com slash win and get a free

hear about us section Oh
all right let's go back to why CPU
mining doesn't make any sense so first
of all um okay part of mining adventure
should you do a like the other ways
video and do like hard drive and CPU
well hard drives coming okay yeah that's
mining adventure side quest did you get
GPU working it's not good
I haven't yet I figured it out though
you just need to use a different plotter
yes yeah so yeah like I just told ya
it's slightly more complicated than that
yeah
but yes I don't care anymore because I'm
using a dual 22 core system and I am
getting up to about 70 to 80 thousand
nonces per minute on CPU so I have so I
have my four instances running at a time
because there seems to be some kind of
limitation that's wrapping me at 60
percent of CPU usage so I've got four
running at a time so while one of them
is committing to the draw or while two
of them are committing to drives the
other two are running and then these
ones will kick back in and then those
ones will kind of run through creating
nonces and then they'll
be committing them to drives and these
two will be running so overnight I was
actually able to do over 10 terabytes on
a single rig with CPU plotting so anyway
to be clear I'm not running out and
buying all the hard drives put away the
pitchforks I'm just experimenting with
birth coiling because it's this coin
that you mind by just allocating empty
hard drive space to it and it doesn't
seem to so in further research and
actually doing it a little bit myself
yeah once it's plotted yeah it doesn't
seem to hurt the drive okay at all
plotting though yeah you're hitting the
drivers rough yeah like really rough so
from talking to guys in the burst
community they're saying that it doesn't
hurt it any more than normal use would
yeah so I'm still not doing it on
petabyte project yeah no because I just
don't even want them spinning if they
don't have to be yeah but on all these
like janky drives that I had sitting in
literally sitting in boxes around the
warehouse why not
might as well so before I go for the
weekend I'm gonna load up as many drives
as I can on that system run them through
all weekend and then buy sort of next
week I should actually have it all going
so far I've made $5 nice yeah there you
go
do you how much more than that I've
spent on electricity a lot I don't know
exactly how much but a lot you can do
dynamic plotting - are you gonna do that
uh no I'm actually not familiar with
dynamic dynamic plotting is you are able
to use the drive Oh add more data to it
the plot will make itself smaller no I
probably gonna do that and you set an
offset so that you have room to put
stuff yeah you put the stuff there and
then it will shrink itself we can
discuss it in the video but that's like
not really the approach I'm taking you
saw the machine I'm using no I know I'm
just saying for for people that have
like it's already getting to the point
where it's probably not that practical
to try to mind with just like the drive
in your computer depending on the pool
you join so the the difficulty so okay
I'll get into this in the video but the
more capacity you have the easier it is
to respond to a job in time in sort of
very very simple terms and so different
fools you know fill our machine basis or
a per address ah that's a great question
wonderful questions no idea okay anyway
so different pools will have different
thresholds for how quickly you need to
be able to respond to a job in order to
benefit from the pool yeah because if
you're just someone with like 300 Meg's
and you're like never never going to
actually discover a coin because it's
like each amount of capacity is kind of
like buying more and more lottery
tickets so if you just have like a tiny
tiny amount you're basically just
piggybacking off of the success of the
big people in the pool so some pools
have very strict requirements for how
much capacity you have to have in order
to be considered a contributing member
and in order to allow you to join so
what you can do is you could join one of
those pools even if you have a hundred
Meg's of data but you would just never
qualify and your entries would reject it
every time you would never benefit don't
hit your drive from plotting and then
never again and then never get anything
and then there's much much looser pools
that have really really long times but
those ones are full of a bunch of losers
that you know no one like are
individually gonna find almost nothing
so anyway right now it's that kind of
like a weird stage where to get the most
out of it you really do need a lot of
drives like it's kind of transitioning
that way interesting not surprised so
back to CPUs so AMD has made a couple
fundamental errors here number one is
calculating ROI time ROI time is a
flawed calculation because it is very
easy to underestimate it or overestimate
it you can't just look at how much it's
bringing in today and go yes that is
going to pay for itself in amount of
time X because because saying it will
pay for itself in amount of time X if
nothing changes is just a sentence that
doesn't matter yeah it will change it
depends when and if you cash out
it depends what currencies you're mining
etc etc etc etc etc it depends on
whether you will even still be able to
mine that particular algorithm nine
months down the
CPU so yeah it depends on a lot of stuff
problem number the second is that
there's more to the cost of a thread
Ripper CPU than the cost of the CPU
itself so thread Ripper motherboards are
like three hundred plus dollars normal
mining motherboards are in the
neighborhood of a hundred plus two
around two hundred for something like a
Seuss's B - fifty - and you're going
pretty hard if you go to that yeah the
other issue here is that you could kind
of go oh okay well thread Ripper is only
like you know fifty percent so double to
fifty percent more than a regular
motherboard but you can effectively make
use of the CPU socket as another mining
you know node or whatever you want to
call it as another miner except the
problem with that is that thread Ripper
is limited to what is it seven PCIe
devices or eight something like that
yeah so you could never have a thread
Ripper mining optimized board because
you could never plug in enough GPUs to
account for this difference in cost so
while yes theoretically you could mine
on thread Ripper you would not do that
if you were actually trying to build an
optimized dedicated mining machine you
might not be though if you're picking a
CPU for your home rig and you want to
like mine overnight it would double your
ROI time for one because you're not 24/7
mining but if you wanted like a beast
machine CPU there's another problem yeah
yeah I'm just not sold and I also wonder
if that's power
yeah power that's probably not any worse
than like remember they're comparing it
to a Vegas but but you're taking away
from your ROI time yep because power is
a cost so that will delay your ROI time
which is a screwed up thing to measure
anyways I think it's a little it's
borderline nefarious in my opinion for a
hardware company that isn't like selling
a six because then who cares anyways to
be
like it'll pay for itself in nine months
that's a little I'm not super stoked on
that personally all right
putting it's like hash rates up and
stuff is fine maybe even if they do an
article I'm like this is why you need l3
cache yeah CPU mic that makes it makes a
lot of sense it's like a blog post cuz a
lot of people don't understand l3 cache
anyways yeah so if you're like look this
is a practical application that needs a
bunch of it that would be an interesting
blog post alright
some random YouTube channel or website
or podcast or whatever picked that up
and was like oh my goodness you can man
with CPUs that's fine cuz that's someone
else do we met so you bought this yeah
is this even legal here okay technically
100% yes uh-huh
it actually making it here imma give it
like a 50% chance
uh-huh my hope is that if they reject it
I can just tell them to ship it
somewhere else
uh-huh then I'll just send it to my
grandpa's or something and he can get
rid of scorpions with 20,000
flamethrowers far 500 US dollars they
sold them within a couple of days
yeah thanks twitch subscribers cuz they
took PayPal here's the caption here
don't do this also I wanted to be clear
that a flamethrower is a super terrible
idea definitely don't buy one unless you
like fun that's kind of lame I hadn't
actually seen it fire yet that's really
that's a really short yeah it's short
burst okay which a lot of people were
like oh that's because of laws and
apparently basically nowhere has
regulations on so one of the reasons why
flamethrowers are not illegal in places
yeah is because people use them as like
weed destruction torches basically
uh-huh and that's apparently really
common in like a lot of farmland and
stuff what you think oh that's gonna
start a forest fire apparently no
because they just like do it properly
and stuff I don't know but yeah there's
there's
no regulations around it in Canada there
is not a single beep about it in the
Firearms Act it's it's apparently
completely allowed I even looked up
import and custom stuff and there's
import and custom stuff about knives
because I'm talking about which blades
yes which blades and stuff and I was
talking about how I like like pocket
knives on my stream once - someone sent
me one and it got grabbed by customs and
customs was like we're keeping this
forever screw you and I was like oh ok
well nothing I can do about that so I
looked it up and yeah there's all the
stuff boat knives there's tons of stuff
about guns there's ways to do it
properly with both of them because
stores can do it you just can't do it
personally and you can let you have to
set up as an entity to be able to import
it and blah blah nothing for
flamethrowers
so my ready it's coming ATF says any
flamethrower with a flame shorter than
10 feet 10 feet is a-okay our design is
max fun for least danger I'd be more
scared of a steak knife this guy is such
a troll yeah like he's such a troll so I
want to cook with it if I don't know
what type of fuel it takes so I don't
know if that's possible if it takes the
right kind of fuel I want to like
propane or something like a know I think
propane we can't no you can with propane
come from you can't with whatever tiki
torches no no no but tiki torches are
like an oil what fuels it ok I mean I'm
not an expert but it but it looks like
it could be a propane flame to me it's
very blue I don't see any reason why
that would not be a propane flame
especially because that would make it
really really cheap and really easy to
to refuel sail drew criticism from a
California politician who said he would
introduce legislation aimed at banning
the flamethrowers we don't allow people
to walk in off the street and purchase
military-grade tanks or armor-piercing
ammunition I cannot even begin to
imagine the problems a flamethrower
would cause firefighters and
officers with that said this is hardly a
military grade tank or you need this to
start a fire this is basically a
blowtorch shaped like a guy yeah
like okay it's a little longer but like
if you can't go to the if you can't go
to the hardware store I couldn't find
something that'll make a fire easier
than this then I don't know man like
honestly that flame is gotta be that's
only up maybe 18 inches maybe like you
can get you can get blow torches that'll
do not much shy of that and probably
hotter if you can jog around an office
with your thing fully firing and
everything's fine yeah like you could
like you saying military-grade whatever
military if you can run around an office
shooting with a gun it's not gonna be
fine yeah okay I think it's hilarious so
honestly now that I've seen it fire like
I was disappointed I didn't order one
now I don't even care it looks kind of
lame oh you oh you figure maybe you can
mod it maybe but it depends on the fuel
like something like your propane I doubt
it yeah I don't know if it is so maybe
maybe people are spending the chat
telling us what it is
Canadian firearms laws so weird 22 snub
nose pistol nope you might hurt yourself
well technically a cannon you can get in
the same classification as a rifle such
a joke it's so bad most stuff is
classified by name instead of by
specification so there's a lot of things
that like look scary that are banned and
there's things that are way scarier that
don't look super scary so they're not
matched so weird
apparently tiki torches use butane
someone's backs me up that it looks like
looks like perfect kind of tiki torches
are we thinking then cuz I'm talking
about those ones with like the wick and
the like kind of wicker there I have no
idea I thought they just used like like
a wick soaked in a thing and they have
like that lemon smell am i thinking of
something else what is was a tiki torch
yeah no that's not that's not like I
thought this is like like a wax or like
an oil look at the way it burns I could
be wrong though tiki torch fuels like
the things that we end up I don't think
it's something something doesn't say
where it is number one torch fuel pre
fueled paradise in your backyard oh wow
please just tell me what is in it thank
you
I wish you would just tell me what's in
it oh man
tiki torch fuel American sale calm with
lemongrass oil oh my goodness okay well
either way there's a lot of like it's
scented with this or it has whatever
else eucalyptus formula ah
I'm dying the kerosene kerosene kerosene
now did you know that we all keeps the
bugs away yeah yeah but that's not there
you go no there's different kinds this
is why it's hard to find paraffin tiki
green whatever this is but like that's
like paraffins a wax type okay but yeah
just something with a wick in it like
it's totally different from from this
yeah I don't know if anyone actually
knows let's see I think you burned
citronella I think that's the yeah
that's the scent crap yeah why switched
out his family in sintra nella I think
that's what like makes it smell good or
keeps the bugs away or something really
the slow mo guys did a cool video using
tiki torch what haven't they done a cool
video about Oh finally Windows 10
defender is finally gonna block those
shady free PC optimizer applications
about time this is supposed to by tech
dreamer on the forum and the original
article is from cloud blogs Microsoft
com protecting customers from being
intimidated into making an unnecessary
purchase how did this take so long I
mean I'm not mad like it's just like a
main thing that they should have been
blocking oh there was something else
that I was like really mad about yeah
how does you know what his windows not
have a built-in screen recorder at this
point outside of games how is it that
iOS has this and Windows doesn't like
there's just some
baffling stuff that they haven't built
in theirs so okay have you heard I don't
think it's in the dock but have you
heard the rumors of the companies
Microsoft is interested in buying no oh
yeah it's propane I just go to their
website 20 ounce propane there you go
so yeah there's no way you're gonna get
a propane propane flame much longer than
that sorry let's change what fuel it is
yeah I don't know and we're talking like
okay to be clear I think there are going
to be people putting new rags in them
and they're gonna be people changing out
the gas I don't care
sure I'm not gonna do it but I think
it's gonna I'm gonna go help my friend
who lives on a farm clear blackberry
bushes with it cuz that sounds fun right
alright anyway that's what I'm what were
you saying about the so this is like
super rumor mill stuff and to be clear
I'm pretty sure if anything I think it's
like insider information I'm super rumor
mill no no no I didn't hear this
directly this is posted on some website
sure okay
and it was very much like they're
interested in doing this not those other
companies are also okay with it sure so
and one of them I'm very sure is not
okay with it but pub G Corp what yay
what and valve which they technically
have the war chest money to deal with
but like I'm sure the last one is not
okay exactly they're yeah they're not
okay with it pub G Corp it sounds like
they're micro their minecraft
acquisition yeah
hey this is already popular and everyone
already bought it let's now buy it too
we're not really sure but okay Kurt fans
actually yeah part of the idea behind
that sorry I just remembered was not
letting it go to PlayStation because
it's a timed Microsoft Xbox exclusive
and I guess they're they might be trying
to buy it before it can go to
PlayStation and I heard that the idea of
them acquiring EA is to get a whole
bunch of expensive can I let me cut you
off right there if Microsoft wanted a
game studio why did they get rid of
Microsoft Game Studios wears a mic need
a mic
well they're still making Microsoft is
games because like whatever that new
pirates game to see if thieves is like a
Microsoft game yeah like not much they
used to be an actual major developer
yeah
well I'm assuming maybe they want to get
back into that I don't know okay so the
EA acquisition idea is interesting
because there's a lot of ways to hate
that because more exclusives for Xbox
and stuff but I mean everyone already
hates EA pretty much at a maximum
capacity already so yeah maybe they
can't hate them even more I don't know
maybe it's not that big of a deal I
don't know um yeah I don't think any of
that's gonna happen I just wanted to
bring up Microsoft stuff um all right
what else we got here is all boring
Apple delays iOS features to focus on
stability that seems like a good idea
couldn't use speaking of built-in screen
recording couldn't use it today without
rebooting it would list it would just go
and then you can stop it and then the
clip would just be gone yeah we tried a
few times it was broken for iOS 12
they've been working on a redesigned
home screen app grid
hopefully by redesign they mean exactly
the same except I can move stuff where
I'm on it multiplayer mode for augmented
reality games ah augmented reality is so
bad like it is so bad we're just we're
not even close for so many years away
he's okay it's bad max it's bad what can
I help you with know we're streaming um
uh a merger the third go somewhere I
phones max do i nevah antonio you didn't
have time after work okay improvements
to face longest-standing video game
record was thrown out after 35 years
this was by Todd Rogers it was for his
dragster record yeah obviously it was
impossible because it's like physically
impossible to happen in the game so are
a lot of his like 1400 other video game
records a lot of them are physically
impossible including records that are
like not actually able to be gotten
in the game because like your score goes
up in increments that his score isn't at
like a lot of the games they'll be in
increments of like 10 and his score will
end in like a 5 it's like that's not how
that works or he'll play Donkey Kong and
like the next highest person is like 10
million points below him ya know it's
super BS and Twin Galaxies records he
has so many records and Twin Galaxies
that make no sense at all and like and
they're the official source for Guinness
World Records and a lot of a lot a lot
or all of his records were posted
through one person who's now like in
jail and like the tapes were seized by
the police so he's like oh yeah all the
tapes of my records are just gone
because of that but then people have
contacted the police they're like no we
returned them all and there's like
basically none so yeah Todd Rock Todd
Rogers records super BS moving on now
his personal website offered a simple
explanation of how he achieved his
unbeatable time while maintaining that
Activision's certification of his time
highlighted in one of the company's
newsletters was enough to cement his
place on the gaming leaderboards great
that's makes sense there's even like if
someone took apart a game I'd found that
like one of the games that he played its
electronically impossible for him to get
the score that he got there's another
game where a camera what it's called
barnstorming or something like that you
fly a plane and you have to fly through
barns and you have to dodge other things
they removed all the ops and so if when
you go up and down to dodge obstacles
you lose a little bit of horizontal
speed so you're supposed to skim things
right it's also move up and down as
little as possible and go straight as
you can but you have to move a little
bit so they removed all the obstacles
from the game and just flew in a
straight line and didn't even make his
time so they're like dude you're BS I
don't know dudes a joke it's finally
being recognized that's good because
there's too many cheaters in the
speedrunning community and the
speedrunning community is great
so stop
there's also a lot of really legit
awesome people in the speedrunning
community so there you go that aren't
Rogers so this is pretty great
TiVo will let users auto skip the

hilarious
um and YouTube will now be labeling
state-funded news broadcasts now here's
a question do they label CNN and Fox
News all right I don't think there's but
there are people who would argue on
either side that they might as well be
funded by the left of the right oh geez
run away you're tuning into the wind
show we've got a lot of great stuff up
on floatplane I can't show it to you
because I'm logged in as an
administrator on the forums so I can't
share my screen with you but there's
some good stuff there you can share it
here and just highlight the things cuz
you don't open the threads anymore okay
so LG wallpaper TV completes that's a
good thumbnail Hey yeah it is I think
we're finally getting a little bit
better at them yeah designing our new
gaming set oh I think this went up
simultaneously but that's a good
thumbnail - it is actually this big that
was cool is that on dude yeah it's on
you - no okay that was cool um can you
build your own mechanical keyboard
another good thumbnail yes what we're
finally getting it I think you know it
took a long time
um is eight gigs of RAM enough in 2018
that's more than eight gigs minor

hundred gig I don't know okay the
fastest laptop we've ever seen eight
cores in a laptop well this was cool Wow
old desktop CPU okay
it's actually an AM four processor in
there with an AM socket
yes that's cool yes hashtag
on gate I can watch it there oh we did
another episode of ultimate compact PC
nice ooh
with the Jedi one yeah that's cool Star
Wars card some picture of some guy with
like seven of each mining and I was like
really
same bat-time same bat-channel
Viji 776 says this show sucked and that
may be true but at least it wasn't
reported
it had slowed down uh no one listens to
