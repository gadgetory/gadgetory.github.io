really gets you fired up is it the
flashy angular designs maybe the thick
cooling the anemic battery life and
super heavy power bricks
yes bricks sometimes they have more than
one well Asus clearly didn't think it
was any of those things because their
follow up to last year's DL 502 the GL
503 features none of them
synergy - makes sharing one mouse and
keyboard between multiple computers so
simple and seamless that anyone can do
it check it out today through the link
below picking up the GL 503 scar Edition
ours is the vs configuration the most
immediately noticeable thing is the
significant difference in build quality
compared to the last generation it's
noticeably thinner which gives it along
with the faux carbon fiber finish here
and the darkened brushed aluminum on the
back panel a bit of extra curb appeal
now as for its little brother the GL 503
hero Edition this is a VM model this guy
gets kind of a feathery half tone vinyl
wrap that looks pretty cool up close but
then from a bit further away
subjectively I think kind of looks like
dust or dirt or something like this now
although they share a common chassis the
keyboard area of the scar Edition
compared to the hero is quite a bit
stiffer leading us to originally believe
that this surface really is made of
carbon fibre hence the title of the
video but as I am blued it to before it
is not it should be noted both of them
are on the excellent side of acceptable
though with better screen flex than the
previous gen as an added bonus there's
more than meets the eye though when
you're comparing the two incoming models
while both of them come equipped with
five USB 3.1 ports for type a and one
type see the scar additions type C over
here is Thunderbolt three enabled
allowing it to drive up to three
external displays speaking of displays
let's switch back over to the hero here
Asus used a 120 Hertz a hva panel for
the hero that's pretty good but the scar
sports a brighter 144 Hertz IPS g-sync
affair with both of them boasting 100%
coverage of the Adobe RGB color gamut
for getting real work done and they both
deliver a spectacularly smooth gaming
experience
in all but the most demanding titles a
gtx 1070 can get near the 100 FPS mark
on medium to high settings and then
especially on the scars g-sync display I
mean this is a huge upgrade compared to
whatever kind of gaming notebook you're
running from a couple of years ago
inside them we find mostly the same guts
that powered the GL 502 except this time
with more storage thanks to Seagate's
fire cuda sshd hybrid drives a soos also
added intake vents above the keyboard
and then a cutout on the rear of the
display hinge that actually clears both
the intake and exhaust vents and allows
the laptop to breathe easy whether the
lid is open or closed and then as a neat
little bonus this notch right here
actually gives you a quick look at the
main indicator LEDs while the notebook a
shut specs aside in terms of expansion
they've both got two ddr4 sodium slots
with one slot populated on each of them
and nvme SSD support along with a single
tuna 1/2 inch SATA mount where they
really differ internally is in their
cooling setups which might help explain
the extra stiffness of the scar it
didn't throttle one bit even under a
combined CPU and GPU load that is as
long as you don't mind the mini vacuum
sound that accompanies a Seuss's / boost
mode by comparison the hero and the last
gen GL 502 put up much worse results as
for our gaming tests it showed a bit of
a blow for blow between the GL 502 and
our scar with all configurations scoring
within 10 FPS of their desktop
equivalence except in csgo where okay
yeah they were different but like if
somebody offered you a 600 scoop ice
cream sundae versus a 700 scoop ice
cream sundae would you really worry
about it for productivity meanwhile the
scar overtakes its predecessor coming
closer to our comparison desktop thanks
to its superior cooling with the hero
taking a backseat now of course all of
that comes with a cost
and I'm not talking money yet without
switchable graphics both of our GL 503
units put up unimpressive battery life
numbers so this is better than the
gaming notebooks of yore but if you're
planning to use either of them for
school you might want to factor an
extension cord and a power strip into
your backpacks weight allowance for
those of you who care the webcam and
built-in microphone look and sound about
like this so serviceable but I wouldn't
go using them for streaming on Twitch or
anything like that as for the side
firing speakers well there are nothing
to write home about either but they're a
significant upgrade in clarity over the
previous model and well within the range
of acceptable moving on to the keyboard
and trackpad do you remember how the
trackpad on the GL 502 had this kind of
lip that made it awkward to use bats
ancient history now we've got flush
track pads that feel smooth and easy to
glide your fingers across with virtually
no input lag and four zones of RGB
lighting on the keyboard now the
switches themselves are just as
satisfying as the GL 502 and the layout
is improved with full-sized arrow keys
now making them easier to find by touch
so overall I've got to say a soos did an
excellent job of refining this design
it's still not to a level where I'd call
it perfect and sure at these prices you
can get this raw performance for Less
not to mention with better battery life
but what a soos brings to the table here
is superior build quality expansion
cooling performance especially in the
scar and perhaps most importantly again
especially on the 144 Hertz car truly
gaming grade screens recommended we're
