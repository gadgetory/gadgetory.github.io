test for you with the iPad 2 as well as
the BlackBerry PlayBook
and the assist transformer running in
android 3.0 so we captured a similar
video clip on the cameras the rear
higher quality cameras of all three
devices and then we're gonna go ahead
and okay I'm not sure how I'm gonna play
all these back at the same time but I'm
gonna try there we go so you guys can
check out the motion as well as the
color that you get from the camera as
well as when it's playing on the screen
so I'm just gonna play them all again so
you can zoom out and have a look
honestly the best screen out of the
three is probably the blackberry
playbook the blacks are deepest the
whites are brightest compared to even
the iPad which or iPad 2 rather which
has a well-renowned
excellent screen I know it's gonna be
hard to tell when you're looking at it
through my camera but the definite
weaker competitor would be the assist
transformer I'm gonna show you guys just
the iPad as well as the BlackBerry
side-by-side right now just so you can
have a look and see what you think I
picks up a lot more detail in the
background behind me even imperfections
in the paint on the camera and then the
hair you can see things like the NCIX
logo on my shirt and my earrings really
pop out a lot better on the blackberry
so that speaks to both the camera as
well as the screen one of the other
things that we noticed cameraman and I
did was that on the hardware canucks
website which I'm just going to navigate
to quickly here so let's go to all and
then browser and then hardware canucks
on the hardware connects website let's
go back to home this color right here
AHA came up on both of them this color
right here is closer on the blackberry
as well as the blacks being darker the
whites being brighter and this is an
actual Nvidia package this is done to
their spec I know for a fact that on on
a properly calibrated monitor it should
be exactly like this
I mean give or take because you have a
backlight but from our observation I
really don't know if you'll be able to
see it in the camera it's much closer on
the BlackBerry device versus the iPad 2
so I'm really impressed that and the
additional pixel density gives you kind
of a similar effect to what I phone four
users have been enjoying for some time
with the Retina display of a much
sharper overall image so thank you for
checking out this little video on the
screens as well as the cameras on the
iPad 2 BlackBerry PlayBook and the
transformer actually one more thing I
want to show you guys I'm sorry I'm just
totally I've got so many different
things that I want to that I want to
demo so here we're gonna bring up the
multitasking we're gonna open up the
hardware connect site let's go to the
home page and I just want to show you
guys the smoothness of the you is as as
a whole with respect to browsing so here
I'll go ahead and step back and I'm just
gonna take each one in turn and flip
them from landscape to portrait okay
so there's no animations on Android 3.0
but it's pretty quick alright
BlackBerry oh you know what I forgot to
zoom out I'm sorry
there we go so the BlackBerry you can
see it is animated oh yeah I got a hold
it right straight up sorry I'm trying to
tilt it away from the cameraman so it's
not really fair there you go so that's
more representative of what what we
would typically see and then I fall our
iPhone iPad everyone's pretty familiar
with is excellent quick snappy let's see
if it works like this - oh yeah see so
it's a little bit smarter than the one
on the blackberry in that even if I'm
holding it at an angle like this it
manages to pick up the correct
orientation and then in terms of the
overall you eyes I mean there's going to
be endless videos on topics like that
but general snappiness is excellent on
the blackberry whether you're navigating
by pressing things whether you're
navigating by scrolling between them all
that good stuff very fast very snappy
iPad everyone knows is really quick
whether it's
zooming or moving things around
scrolling around switching between tasks
all that good stuff is very very fast
and then Android has a little bit of
chop to it I don't think that's to do
with the processor so hopefully it's
something they can address update wise
but I think you guys will open something
up here I don't even know what this is
okay so thank you for checking out this
