that I'm very excited about I haven't
bought myself any cool new toys that are
this cool in quite a while
so I'm gonna be doing a small upgrade on
my machine I'm not gonna be changing my
graphics card I'm sticking with my GTX
480 I'm actually gonna be downgrading my
RAM cuz right now I have 24 gigs on an
MSI Big Bang X power with a a I can't
remember core i7 980 X and so I'm gonna
be taking out two dims and going with a
quad channel 16 gigs set up with new
2011 processor and so I figured hey if
I'm gonna go 2011 maybe it's time to
upgrade the old waterblock Oh Swift Tech
release the coolest waterblock ever so
today I will be unboxing the Swift Tech
Apogee HD limited edition 24k
gold-plated waterblock these are
individually numbered and very limited
edition they only produced a few hundred
of them that's apparently my number so
let's go ahead and get this baby opened
up so here's the CPU it's gonna be
working on so it comes with first and
foremost an installation guide which is
by the appearances ok in color sort of
certain parts are in color so they show
you how to put the thing on the thing
and line it up with the other thing and
put the goop on the other things ok next
we've got a backplate of some sort so
this might be 2011 it might be 1366 not
hundred percent sure what it is
oh yeah mounting hardware that's
included here this is a good way to know
for sure
so it includes ah 11 55 and 56 1366 and
2011 you can request free upon demand
775 and AMD hold down plate and hardware
for any of their given sockets so there
you go so it it only includes sort of
the more modern Intel sockets okay here
we've got the just general general memo
oh no this is the 2011 kit okay so cool
so what's in here
so we've got four big thumb hold down
screws I'm gonna put these on here so
you guys can see them a little bit
better
so if AK does such a good job of their
mounting hardware they're true pioneers
when it comes to mounting hardware and
hold on I'm just gonna make sure I don't
use these uh whose washers so there's a
couple washers here to hold them in
place that I really hope I haven't lost
one although it would appear that I may
have whatever I'll find it I'll find out
there it is okay good okay so I got four
of those I got four of those really
sharp just nice big thumb screws and
then there there's Phillips heads on the
inside if you do want to do that these
Springs so this is one of the things
that Smith Tech is so good at they
design their mounting hardware to apply
the exact right amount of pressure no
more no less and they were one of the
first ones - well not really one of the
first ones but they're one of the only
ones in the water cooling space that
really pay attention to the actual spec
for a given socket and then adhere to it
and then we've got a couple of clamps so
those are your worm drive clamps for
your for your Barb's so you want to you
know go ahead and use a slot screwdriver
to tighten those up I don't like these I
prefer compression fittings these are
the compressions I'll be using with this
block - got some included thermal goop
some pk-1 really they're using their
bundling Pro Lima tech thermal goop
fascinating pk-1 as far as my
understanding goes is basically pretty
much the same thing as mx1
although I could be wrong about that
either way I've heard that pk-1 is very
good I mean if they are gonna compare it
to MX one then yeah it's pretty good
anyway so here we go
socket 2011 installation kit how to use
so you take off these you put on those
you follow the instructions and nobody
gets hurt okay now let's get to the
water block itself which fella needs
some unveiling here we even drumroll
that's right dead sexy gold-plated
waterblock that I saw and simply had to
have there's a limited edition with the
engraved number on it so like I said
they only did a few hundred of these so
I and one of my co-workers actually
bought two of the first three that NCIX
is sold one guy pre-ordered it so he got
one right away and then when they
arrived in the warehouse this afternoon
I ordered one up and I went down and I
grabbed one because yeah these are like
for sure this chisel so in terms of
mounting options the Apple GHD actually
has a couple of different choices so you
can either use these guys as the inlet
and the outlet or you can use these ones
as the inlet the outlet I'll be using
these two since I'll be using
compression fittings here I'm just gonna
take all one of my compression fittings
out and I'll show you guys I'll do a
quick test fit here show you guys what
it's gonna look like with a big
gold-plated compression fitting so these
are bits power unfortunately swift tech
includes gold-plated barb fittings I'm
not much of a barb fitting guy I really
do prefer compression so I'm gonna go
ahead and replace these and while those
are on pretty tight so you know what
I'll be back in a sec sorry guys so
here's a trick that I use whenever I
have delicate delicate equipment is I'll
take whatever tools I have and I'll put
a cloth between them and what I'm
applying them to so here's the barb
coming out of the block you can actually
here you can have a look at the socket
there so you can see the gold plating
goes all the way into the block itself
and you can actually see the innards of
the Apple GHD so this is Swift Tech's
latest generation highest performance to
date water block so let's go ahead and
see how closely these gold platings
match the bits power ones a little bit
more yellow but it should still look
pretty
Ted bling when I go ahead and throw that
on there
there you go so that should give you
guys some idea how this is gonna look
once it's got a couple of compressions
on it so I wouldn't I'd be remiss if I
didn't give you guys sort of the
obligatory reflecting shot to show you
what a mirror is here you can see my cat
in it Hey Rumble come here see can you
see the cat look at that that's a water
block yeah that's right okay so yeah
there you guys here I'm actually
scanning fingerprints ah when you buy
something for the whole like and the
whole point is that it's like super
beautiful the last thing you want to do
is cover it and ugly fingerprints and
get scratches on it so you can see the
gold plating goes here and the copper
base starts here and then there's the
hold-down
which can be replaced so that's black
what I imagine someone will probably do
is they'll buy this block they'll strip
the paint off the hold-down and they'll
get a gold-plated - so the whole thing
will just like look like shiny eagle
ridiculous but I think we're pretty much
done here thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the a bougie
HD so as I said before this is Swift
Tech's new flagship block this is a
gold-plated version of it so this is
about as high-performing and about as
low-flow because that's really what
they've been focusing on achieving since
way back in the storm days when when
impingement blocks were cool and then
after that they went to the apogee so
the pin matrix High Flow low
restrictions type design so we've got
yeah whatever I'm not gonna say much
more about it cool block looks amazing I
am very much looking forward to getting
it cooling this CPU which will go here
and will be cooled and it will be
awesome and it will be gold and yeah and
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos so my assistant
here is giving you a hard time as some
of you may or may not know I use blue
tubing in my system and the comment was
oh that's not gonna look
with blue tubing and I said well are you
sure because personally I think it's
gonna look great with blue tubing so
I'll let you guys be the judge does it
look good with blue tubing you tell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
