2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm guys we're here at the WD
booth at computex 2013 it's day two this
is our home base and there's a bit of a
team meeting going on here some photo
opportunities I just want to remind you
guys we've got a ton of giveaways that
we're doing in collaboration with WD you
can check out the WD home page they've
got a link to all their videos or you
can click the link in the video
description to the linus tech tips forum
where there's full details we're giving
away internal drives external drives
full-blown gaming systems but we're not
going to be talking about gaming systems
in this particular video we're going to
be focused on the slim thin in light two
and a half inch WD drives that are
available in some pretty new and
interesting configurations let's go have
a look now these are the drives I
alluded to before where we're pushing
the envelope in terms of the storage
available in these slim form factors now
for a long time we've had very thin
devices I mean iPads and iPods and I
foods and whatever else there happens to
be but the problem is that they all rely
on flash which is fast and it's shock
resistant but what it isn't is high
capacity now this is a traditional nine
and a half millimeter Drive can i get my
lovely assistant to hold up a slim
notebook for me here that clearly with
all the other things that need to be
inside such as the keyboard and touchpad
and PCB and all that stuff that clearly
wasn't going to fit so that is where
slim 7 millimeter drives came into play
so we were able to get reasonable
capacities into these form factors the
problem with seven millimeter drives was
they still weren't that high capacity
and the fact that well they still
weren't really thin enough for some of
the devices people wanted so WT
completely re-engineered the two and a
half millimeter drive to make it more
shock resistant I don't know if you guys
saw that fall but it is still as shock
resistant as one of the larger drives
and they are able to achieve new
capacities in seven millimeter as well
as a completely new form factor which is
the five millimeter drive so this right
here is a 110
bite device in a 7 mil form factor and
this guy right here is a 500 gig drive
in a five millimeter slim form factor so
how do you do that the question might be
well number one is instead of using a
metal top they're actually sealing the
top with a plastic coating number two is
changing to a micro PCB you know how I
mentioned that the drive won't fit in
the notebook because of all the
electronic components that are all over
the bottom of it well WT went ok well
the bottoms of our drives are covered in
these things so I guess let's just cover
less of the bottom of the drive in it
and then we'll have more room for
platters so the main difference between
the ultra-slim which is the five mill
and the slim which is the seven mil is
that this one has one platter inside for
500 gigs of storage and the other one
has two platters inside for one terabyte
of storage now robustness is so
important for these form factors I mean
check out this tablet right here go
ahead and lift this up for me I'm going
to do my trademark phone thickness
comparison here so you are actually
talking about a device that has a hard
drive inside it that is not much thicker
than a smartphone this is an HTC One so
it's not exactly a brick by any stretch
of the imagination but what does that
mean for the ruggedness and the
robustness of the drive itself this new
design actually increases the resistance
to damage whether it is from touching
the top of it which makes no sense to
the layman like me because I look at
this thing and I go holy crap i can
actually see the outline of the
components inside it doesn't even have a
metal cover but it actually improves the
ruggedness of the drive compared to a
metal cover which is just mind-blowing
so these tablets right here are actually
showing a number of drop tests that were
done by WDS engineering team where they
basically go ok let's uh let's drop it
let's play catch with it let's do all
these stuff and what happens is the
heads actually park and you can even
that they actually want us to do a demo
maybe one of the other days we'll see
we'll see if we can get a tablet that we
can drop but you can actually playback
media files uninterruptedly heads are
parked on these hybrid drive so this
right here we didn't talk about this yet
these are the black drives so they are
sshds or hybrid drives that implement
this new technology so we can have up to
a 500 gigabyte ultra-slim or a one
terabyte slim but not only do they have
all the drive components on here they've
actually put an end flash as well
anywhere from 8 gigs to 16 gigs to 24
gigs is available on these hybrid drive
so right now you're going to see these
in OEM devices only but it's extremely
exciting to see some of the stuff that
we have on demo here actually that when
I can't lift up but hopefully you get
the point now behind me here i have
three glass showcases this one was
impressive in sort of you know yeah WD
that's pretty 2012 there what you got
going on so this is a one terabyte nine
and a half millimeter drive this uses
the the old design so they got the big
metal cover single stage actuator you
got a couple platters in there and then
check that out that honking huge PCB I
mean how did they get away with that
kind of inefficiency before it I'm just
I'm just I'm just messing with these
guys but the reality of it is these new
drives for 2013 have been completely
re-engineered so you see that plastic
coating on the top underneath that is an
extremely thin piece of what they're
calling a micro metal it's so slim and
thin that it still protects the drive
and in fact gives it that ruggedness but
doesn't take up extra space next we've
got a dual stage actuator which improves
the accuracy of the drive the ability of
it to read from the platters we've still
got two platters inside the drive and
then moving down this is where a lot of
the innovation actually happened that
PCB design you saw before with all the
extra stuff they got rid of everything
miniaturized everything and they were
able to get the PCB completely out of
the way of the spinning platters
themselves reducing the thickness again
now this guy right here uses the same
technology this is the ultra slim so
that's a seven mil you're looking at
before right there and this is the five
millimeter so I'd like my
lovely assistant to come in here and
show me how slim a five millimeter drive
is this is an HTC One so you can pretty
much store 500 gigs of storage in this
or you can store like you know your
contacts and your cell phone and I mean
these are impressive to you got to give
them some credit right so there you go
guys this is our day to coverage of the
WD booth focusing on their ultra slim
and slim drives available in 500 gig and
one terabyte capacities don't miss any
of our computex show coverage and don't
miss any of our WD videos for a chance
to win awesome prizes after the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
