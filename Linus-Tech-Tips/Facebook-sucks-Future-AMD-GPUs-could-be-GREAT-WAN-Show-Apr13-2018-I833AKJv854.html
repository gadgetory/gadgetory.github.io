between two ferns the Linus tech tips
addition I have laser James with me here
today and we're gonna talk about a whole
bunch of different privacy news
including the whole Facebook thing with
Mark the suck Zuckerberg am dean a vgpu
being potentially amazing or not nothing
do with privacy no and other non privacy
news yes there could be a new successor
to the chromecast and competitor to
Amazon fire stick I'm actually stoked on
this hold up okay and and mostly other
privacy stuff but also the FTC says
warranty void stickers like warranty
void if remove stickers RBS which is
awesome that makes me really happy but
stay tuned to see that and more on the
LAN show that is actually going to have
an intro today we're doing the intro oh
no it wasn't ready Colton Oh spoiler
alert
so package so the answer that question
was no and we're dead
be quiet which you already saw I think
synergy - and wear space awesome
works next time and go like that
there we go welcome to Rancho you might
be able to tell we've had a little bit
of change of scenery we're actually in
pretty close to the same area but I
can't tell you why things have obviously
changed or for how long or if they'll go
back or when they'll go back or any of
that detail so speculate as you will
that's I think that's so big buddy let's
go I've been good you've been away I
haven't seen you in like I have been
we'll see way I was like I'm gonna be an
office way more from now on I made it in
one day this week
it was great you were in the city like
in the country all week yeah you've been
back from packs like that whole time
yeah like what happened tell us about it
no I I got back on Sunday pax was good I
did there was really not a lot of
hardware stuff there we used to so like
back when I first started working here I
asked lion as my first time off request
ever was to go to pax okay and I was
like just assume that I'm gonna ask for
this time off for the rest of my career
working with you and then immediately
the next year he was like mm you're
gonna work it just at PAX and I was like
Kay well that sounds like a pretty okay
compromise so I started making videos at
PAX about computer hardware now in
retrospect good compromise it was it was
it was interesting it was a fun thing to
do I really like pack so I've been to
like 15 of them so working some of those
was probably okay but there used to be
an abundance of new interesting stuff at
PAX it's usually peripherals we get a
lot of keyboards we get a lot of mice
get a lot of headsets that kind of stuff
but we sometimes get cases and a few
other things there's there was never
like a graphics card or something but
there was always a lot of technology
videos to make sure that slowly started
dwindling over the years the amount of
potential technology videos at PAX
slowly started reducing constantly over
time but here's my question yes so do
you prefer to go as Luke or as Luke from
Linus media group I I can't
not go as Luke reminds me now yeah I
guess but like on your third or fourth
time there when maybe people didn't know
you were Luke from Lyons Media Group
okay so you're working there but you
weren't like super famous
so the that would be yeah there was like
one year cap and that that was pretty
good it was funny because my dad always
does this
so okay a little bit of backstory when I
go to pax I just born it for facts I was
conceived at the Corsair boots like
that's been to a million ease yeah I
know so my dad brought me packs as a
like as a birthday present
and he brought myself my best friend and
so we went from when I was like really
young and the first year that any amount
of people knew me at all which was a
very very small amount of people because
I think I had been in one way and show
that's it all the time I went to this
pax that year my dad would like look
around for anyone that stared at me for
too long and then would go like get them
[Laughter]
so yeah that was pretty cool but ya know
it's I still I really like meeting
people I think the reason why I would
have probably preferred the old one was
because I'd like to pax more back in the
day mmm but that's not actually be that
doesn't have anything to do yeah well
that was my question
ultimately was now that there's fewer
videos to make do you get to enjoy the
show more and it's kind of like the best
of all worlds I would have if there was
more stuff to check out so overall it's
just it's much bigger now and when you
become much bigger in terms of those
types of shows that usually become a
little bit more corporate a little bit
more stale there's more rules now like
back in the day a booth would have like
a giveaway and everyone would swarm it
and they'd like throw stuff out and it
was crazy not you're not allowed
throwing things probably someone got
hurt which has to ruin the fun and
everything and like I don't know it just
it became bigger became more corporate
it's not as like nice and nerdy anymore
it's still really cool it's a great
event I love going I hope LTX never
suffers from that remember how much
stuff we threw last year we exactly
what's got murked
serious it was serious like looking at
the size of your eyes biting your finger
like like that was actually too bad that
was too far yeah the case to us yeah we
are in closing at this time that's and
that's what I was actually going to say
not to promote LTX too much I don't even
think we're supposed to on this show but
I'm doing it anyways oh no it was
amazing the first year we had it was so
much fun and I think there was some
definite problems like the mainstage was
kind of under produced and there was a
couple other this sounds a big issue
than music yeah issued Linus wore two
canned that really bothered me that's
like the main stage is an issue
the sound is big issue Linus wore
clothing that I didn't appreciate well I
mostly saw him when he was on stage and
every time he came out and he had a
toque on I was like who's this like a
opening hip-hop act like who's this guy
and then it was Linus I was like what a
toque isn't part of your like he's like
never worn that's not part of your
uniform yeah here yeah I hear ya
yeah I don't know I'm really excited for
the next one it's gonna be bigger we're
gonna have more booths where to I'm not
gonna let up the enclosed chaos is
getting sweet because you can do bank
shots and try to down below more like
getting some kind of angle that's not
gonna be my strategy okay you know
you're gonna try to go for side wall or
the roof I don't know high for like roof
side wall ground you don't even have to
I guess it's a distance challenge not a
damaging challenge because if it was
just trying to break the case you could
just go completely laterally right yes
I'm sure there'll be some kind of troll
shots like that yeah probably
anyways we should probably talk about
actual news I think we already
introduced a bunch of topics but we can
start with probably the most yea
expected topic of the week is that we
learned this week that Zuckerberg drinks
water like this he's been working on
this it's actually pretty good at this
point
yeah yeah then you gotta be the smile
meter thing so gradually tiny it's so
good okay so I'm gonna let me hold on I
gotta be Linus here for a second which
I'm not used to there we go
facebook users aren't changing their
privacy settings despite uproar so this
has been a pretty interesting wait a
second who posted out in the forum
shorty 88 jr. good jobs or always forget
we do thank you very much I appreciate
it yeah so people aren't really leaving
people aren't into privacy settings
apparently people aren't even changing
what type of things they share with the
platform so there's this like giant
uproar well actually I think it kind of
speaks to the whole issue because if you
watch any of the Congress I don't even
know what you call that the inspection
of a lot of it was like he keeps
defaulting to be like okay we do tell
them everything our terms of services
all here nobody reads it it's gone we
know that nobody reads it so we also
have these these little um dialog boxes
that are the top near newsfeed that tell
you like hey in plain English you can
share this with the world or not they do
all these things to make it transparent
what they're doing it's just no one
cares though no one cares I like by and
large no one cares so I think a
surprisingly low amount of people
actually care about the privacy there is
like and I bet you a a abnormally high
percentage of the audience here and I
think an abnormally high percentage of
tech people in general because I think
those people actually understand better
what's happening when they're putting
their privacy out there I I think the
average person sees it as like Oh some
mega corporation knows that I like Fung
sandals yeah I got nothing to hide
maybe they'll sell me a few thong
sandals and they don't understand that
like it's going further than that and
your data is being picked apart further
than that and Facebook is selling it to
people that you don't necessarily know
they don't sell the data well it gets
given away in dead
yeah well it still does yeah it really
did for ya I don't know
and like the fact that a myriad of
platforms get hacked every single year
and people's data gets pulled out of
that not saying that happened to
Facebook but it happens to human people
you can check out I think's have I been
poned calm yeah yeah that's not
specifically Facebook data no I'm saying
I'm talking about privacy in general
yeah yeah I actually said specifically I
don't think it's happened to Facebook
like at all correct but there has been
huge companies that have had leaks like
that and and those leaks could could
make your facebook vulnerable if you're
using the same password across lots of
sites so what normally happens is like
LinkedIn got hacked so the dark webs has
your your password for LinkedIn that
gets bought by someone else who takes
that password and tries it and a bunch
of other sites like your email your bank
Facebook and if you're the type of
person has the same pass for everything
you might be compromised on lots of
sites that never actually got hacked
themselves yeah it's it's and like what
I was more getting to is just the idea
that people don't understand how their
data can spread and like not just on
Facebook I mean in terms of using the
Internet as a whole non tech people
don't necessarily understand how like
putting their data in some place or
putting their credit card information in
some place can result in it getting to
other places but it kind of leads into
the regulation discussion here because
there's yes a lot of talk about
regulating Facebook and there's kind of
three different ways that that could go
the first is what Facebook would
probably like which is just to
self-regulate and that seems more and
more like everybody wants it seems more
and more that it's like maybe less
likely to me anyway because what happen
yeah okay yeah yeah yeah because there's
this awesome article it's been written
by Zeynep what's her last name
she's that security researcher I'm
really bad with especially last names so
she's awesome she wrote this kind of
article that blew up about like 14 years
of Facebook's apology tour Oh in the
beginning they've been like a lot of
people gave props to Zuckerberg for kind
of taking ownership of what has happened
at Facebook and apologizing for it not
like deflecting or saying mistakes were
made but the same time he's been doing
that for
like a decade and a half so at some
point it's like stop stop letting him
screw up so much yeah so option one
Facebook self-regulates option two they
regulate the entire industry that would
be really stifling to innovation yeah
really if you've ever worked at a
company that was undergoing some kind of
like you know we're gonna implement
compliance for a HIPAA which is like a
health healthcare security doing that
stuff is intense and drains company
resources more than you could ever
imagine less you've actually gone
through it yourself it's crazy and
there's a time one ton like that so if
there was something like that for the
social media industry you can basically
guarantee yourself that there will be no
new upstarts like that's hard enough to
make a new social network it's hard
enough given that network effects are
such an important part of it like you
need to have a bunch of users before
it's useful to people if you're gonna
have this other layer of compliance
you're basically solidifying Facebook's
position and all incumbents positions so
that's yeah I I don't I don't think
you're guaranteeing that there will be
no challenges but I haven't seen even
without this I haven't seen very many
successful challenges to Facebook at all
any ways Google+ completely failed and
anyone that really tries just gets
bought and consumed anyways so it was
funny when that one senator was like
who's your biggest competitor
it's like you don't understand network
economies because but by virtue of way
they the way they work there are no
competitors like it's a win-win or take
all such a situation we're like
everyone's on this platform
therefore everyone's using this platform
you can't split them there could never
be half people here in half there yeah
with completely overlapping functions it
doesn't work that way
option three for regulation would be if
Facebook itself just has a like
dedicated third party or agency that
only regulates Facebook like some kind
of steward of the data to me that's like
the most likely situation but this one
to enshrines Facebook's current market
position because if it's the case that
Facebook has so much data about you
and they regulate such that that data
can never leave Facebook then no one
else has no upstarts have access to that
data in the way that the developers on
the Facebook platform did in the past
and that's how Cambridge analytic I came
to get the big data that leaked anyway
so if no one has access to that then
they're just sitting on this gold mine
of data that no one can compete with so
you're kind of in a pickle on the either
way so I'm gonna make a straw poll here
which is how should Facebook we be
regulated or not you need four bro
yeah itself expands oh dude itself
regulates wait oh I think I have to fill
this one out maybe and then hit enter
not regulated self regulated third there
we go nice and weird like that but like
dedicated like they only regulate
Facebook can't type on this keyboard for
some reason probably it's way over there
it's just a really weird one you know
like it's this QWERTY layout used to
Dvorak I know I can't believe it's been
around since the 1870s but whatever okay
so we have not regulated self regulated
third-party regulations specifically for
Facebook and government-wide spanning
right they're gonna put a troll on cirno
donkey balls
donkey come on last week it was donkey
balls
we've been regulated self-regulate okay
so check that straw poll out hit us with
the feedback I want to see what you guys
think I kind of have my own opinion but
do you have a while we wait for that
let's fantasize about some kind of
future epic social network startup
that's all blockchain based where every
individuals data is completely owned by
them is on a blockchain so that the
entire Internet is modular so that you
can switch from one social network to
another and bring your data with you and
release to each social network exactly
what you want that would be the most
beneficial to new and
because you could start up your own
social network and people could come to
it and be like here's all the data and
here's all the connections here's all
the people I know and something you'd
have like this really thick market and
strong network effects right away
someone said it's called steam it wow I
don't like that platform but I is that
how that actually works I know that
platform is blockchain based but is it
like what you're describing I don't
think so I have no idea but what I have
heard is that all the current social
like blockchain based social media
projects are junk yeah I heard it on a
podcast I don't actually know I haven't
tried it myself
Pied Piper I wouldn't put steam in my
title sounds like steaming pile you know
it's like it's like ste MIT or something
like that I don't remember exactly how
it works I'm gonna check in on this
straw poll actually let's see okay not a
meaningful split at all really donkey
please okay that plays into what we were
saying earlier where it's like honestly
most people don't really care and even
in Arad they just don't know well that's
fair it's a pretty should've had a like
I don't know and then I don't care that
should have been
that's donkey I guess but two together
but yeah that's the problem is that
they're both together so right now all
right I'm not on the screen right now
we're looking at 25% for third-party
regulation specifically for Facebook I'm
kind of surprised by that do tell I'm
just kind of surprised by that because
in that situation you're putting a
weight on Facebook which I don't think
anyone's gonna care about but you're
putting a weight on Facebook so that
opens the door to more other platforms
but then those other platforms are
probably have the same problem and then
do you at that point once they're big
yeah hit the regulation specifically for
Facebook and then push it on them mmm or
like so do you just let people run
rampant with other people's data at the
beginning and then go like you shouldn't
have done that
but we didn't tell you not to so it's
okay but now you have to stop yeah it
kind of sounds like you need to have a
hybrid approach where there are certain
ground rules for everybody to begin with
Oh
already is existing laws but also how to
consider users choices right not like
because this is happening let's just
there's a societal shift where people
are prioritizing and caring more about
this kind of thing right so if a new
upstart comes knocking on your door
asking you to become a user you're more
likely to ask for like well what kind of
data like what are you guys doing what
do you want for me yeah so in that
climate then like maybe a light touch
regulation is enough I don't know and
then people the the next highest
category that wasn't donkey was
government-wide spanning regulation
which I'm not super surprised was up
they're not regulated I'm honestly
pretty surprised that that even got 13%
but then I guess there are well those
are the people who know how to set the
permissions of the way they have yeah
it's going fine just read the TOS yeah
people who are gonna actually like
manage it properly themselves which
unfortunately isn't everybody which is I
guess the problem I have with it cuz
like my mom is not gonna understand what
to do
my mom she's just mean she's probably
watching but like I'm not saying that
they're not even yeah yeah like it's
it's my mom's actually surprisingly good
with some things but she can also
somehow manage to send emails with her
text messaging program without any of us
being able to figure out how for like
months at a time like it's it's there's
there's people that have a special touch
with technology and there's people that
when they use it it falls apart
magically and like as far as I can tell
it has nothing to do with being her
fault but anyways I love my own touch
but like I don't know there's people
that are super in the know in a platform
and there's the people that aren't and
it varies I took my socks off right
before the show but now I want them back
on why my feet got cold oh my goodness
you having cold feet yeah that this
regulation platform idea yeah change my
mind if we could get like four more
people to vote for donkey that would be
great because then it would be in first
place and then we can just be done with
this straw poll but I think we're
probably done with this topic in general
meanwhile AMD Nobby GPUs yeah rumour
mealtime let's uh let's get away from
don't come through this way go away
please
thank you let's jump down to AMD Navi
Navi is the next generation of
architecture from AMD GPUs and it is a
seven nanometer architecture and the
rumor of these days is that it's not
gonna it's not gonna be the source of
the next wave of enthusiasts cards it's
not gonna be the next Vega in fact it's
gonna be a what they call the mainstream
lineup which were mainstreamed here
which right now is the rx5 80s those
guys also thank you ryujin 2013 on the
forums yeah so what they're saying is
that when these cards launch in 2019
they're gonna have a comparable
performance to a GTX 1080 which came out
in the end of May basically June 2016
but it'll cost about 250 bucks
which is nice Wow right now is more than
that MSRP 250 bucks who knows what it'll
actually cost fair mining stuff is going
down a lot because Bitcoin super down
right now well it's going up in the last
day or two Oh has it yes no no yes it's
back baby again
man that man oh dear dad Anna and then
with new cards that are high-performance
for lower dollar value it might become
more profitable about blah blah blah
blah blah so we'll see but yeah MSRP has
not been a realistic thing for actually
quite a long time especially on the AMD
side we've seen accidental artificial
whatever spawned from Bitcoin inflation
whatever you want on GPUs for quite a
long time even well before it was
identified as being a Bitcoin mining
problem we had inflation in JavaScript
prices all the way from back to the
launch of these cards which was well
before mining Bitcoin was like super
trendy there's lots of reasons not at
GTX yes yeah I thought when I first read
that and I I read that they were aiming
na'vi at at this particular market
segment i thought are they doing that
like to satisfy shareholders is it just
more cost effective and they're gonna
it's a bigger addressable market because
stop it max you're doing that thing you
said you're gonna do get out of here all
right there's just more people who have
the money to buy a cheaper but like
still good like well $250 is a really
nice price one for a graphics card
around 300 bucks is fairly reasonable
for a quite a large amount of people for
a graphics card yeah 250 bucks is pretty
good still if you can like pcs aren't
gonna get here realistically but if like
at least not in the short term but 300
bucks in like 2013 was like the golden I
remember there was articles about it all
over the place we're like $300 for a
relatively high ticket item was really
good for consumers because a lot of
people could gather that much money in a
reasonable amount of saving time to
listen this should be comparatively
cheaper than because with inflation and
everything with inflation and it's $250
yeah but it isn't the full component for
a computer but it's a nice upgrade so
it's a sound business it's a good price
if they're just doing this strategically
that would make sense but then I learned
that actually history is repeating
itself here because this is a new what
they call manufacturing node this is a
seven nanometer part the lithography
that is they can't get the yields on all
their wafers at a at a rate or a
quantity that makes a lot of sense uh
economically for them so that was really
convoluted let me just say what I
actually have written down from a
manufacturing point of view it is not
feasible to produce a large GPU like a
1080 like a big one or Vega on a brand
new cutting edge process like seven
nanometer early in the nodes lifecycle
because it's just a new technology and
they haven't ironed out all the
manufacturing kinks yet so once they do
it's conceivable in the future maybe in
2021 that they could use the seven
nanometer of the fog rafi to make bigger
cards yeah make sense some more you know
hooray it's it's I don't know this is
good for a lot of reasons
AMD needs to keep doing well they're
doing quite well right now one
interesting observation that I had at
PAX we're talking about pax earlier on
of the show
Intel did not have a
there that was weird and tell us how to
boo that packs like every packs as far
as I know for the last five or six years
and video wasn't there that's not super
surprising they used to be at every pax
then they started dwindling off but okay
no Intel no Nvidia hey soos booth was
much smaller than normal
AMD had a fairly big booth that was
popping the whole thing it was full
there was queues they had they had VR
setups but there was VR setups multiple
other places on the show that didn't
have a line but the line at AMD was full
all the time it was an interesting
experience to see that the community has
kind of opened up to AMD as a whole if
you look back into like 2014 they were
actually very much so underdog that like
the underground people were like yeah
I'm gonna buy one of these even though
like you know maybe doesn't make a ton
of sense I'm gonna get it anymore my
money is just a donation name yeah
basically
hey but now it's actually a lot more
logical to go for their stuff which is
really cool and it's it's really cool to
see them coming back it was a pretty
awesome moment to see their booth packed
at PAX yeah because even at PAX West
which was I guess in the very beginning
of September 2017 the AMD booth was not
that bad
so you're saying now that this hasn't
even been that long now that there's no
competition that their booth is popping
well it helped I guess and like they did
a much better job with their booth which
in a way kind of sort of not really but
kind of indirectly maybe there's a lot
of caveats there I'm water not like
Zuckerberg the other work continued oh
he's got he's got sorry I'll ignore it
I'll know it it kind of shows success in
the company they have the money to
flaunt at an event spending way too much
money on a ridiculously small ROI of
having a booth as a shareholder that
angers me yeah yeah that makes sense
it's if you look at the ROI of a booth
you're actually not showing to that many
people and it costs a ludicrous amount
of money you're probably getting up
giving a whole bunch of product away
you're probably gonna have to pay a
bunch of staff like it's a really
expensive thing to do but it's it's to
cater to your super fans and
the ROI is hard to describe but it
reaches and the branding that it is
branding huge in this space and you're
you're making yourself a constant part
of the conversation and you're trying to
spread that ROI beyond at just that
event that's kind of the idea so I don't
know it was really interesting to see
that I'm very happy about
AMD's fairly recent success and I hope
they keep going and I hope this is part
of it
because if you can get 1080 performance
off a $240 card that breaches people
into a way higher level of gaming yeah
but this is three years after the fact
though like a year from now you're gonna
have a 1080 yeah which is like and we'll
have to see like if mining does crash
super hard and people start selling
mining cards for dirt cheap then it
might not matter because you might be
able to get ten eighties for around that
price anyways it just might be kind of
sketchy but the most tired
yeah or you might get you turn your
computer off it just falls apart it's
like I've been running for so long the
dust was holding me together or we might
get 1080p eyes for that price or
whatever else right who knows but if
mining does stay up there and the price
of this does inflate that might still
even be helpful who knows
she's just trolling you man you trolling
me there's a door that's open here for
the people who don't know yeah max is
loitering we like having contact because
if I go to close the door oh I can't
there's a sandbag in the way and if I go
to close the door it will it will block
the camp well not entirely actually you
just have to look through like a fire
rated window I would like to end the
show that way actually closing the door
yeah I'll crawl under there remove the
sandbag go bye-bye okay okay
I'm down all right wait till the end the
show that's gonna be a nice trick it's
gonna happen yeah so anyways there is a
weird a bunch of documentation showed up
this is the next topic okay I'm sure
documentation showed up at a random I
mean to to our ears rise anyway people
who aren't in the know of these things a
random seeming manufacturer in China has
the documentation that describes like
specs out this new mysterious Google
branded dongle which is like a 4k
Android TV dongle
as you can see yeah and some people
might think this is boring because
they're like yeah okay it's it's a Roku
or it's an Amazon yeah I was wondering
why you care so I'll tell you why I care
so much I have a chromecast at home okay
and I also have a Google home okay
those things work together they're
attached to my TV which is a smart TV
the Smart TV has a remote and I use that
remote and that Smart TV to use apps
like YouTube a lot the problem is that
Google home and casting by voice is
incompatible with my remote when I cast
if I'm like google play the latest Linus
tech tips video on the TV and it plays
it I can't then grab my remote and hit
next video and start scrolling around
and stuff like that because my Smart TVs
YouTube app is a different app than the
app that gets used when I cast things by
voice I basically have to YouTube the
APIs on my TV with this you're gonna be
able to do that just like when you have
a amazon firetv stick they actually the
microphone them excuse me the remote is
a microphone you can talk into it this
remote is the same deal it has a
dedicated Google assistant button on it
so this is the remote he's talking about
by the way and presumably I'm gonna be
able to say goog star play this video on
I don't want too hot word people I know
I was gonna say you guys got to
appreciate that he didn't include the
first word yes when he's paying
attention play the latest video I'll be
able to watch that video and then I'll
be able to just use my remote and then
back and forth and that is gonna be
that's huge for me i hey good we'll play
the hipster song with the whistling I
had to I'm sorry continue you don't want
to leave those Alexa play the hipster
song with the whistling people out it's
not gonna work though because I think
that's a fairly specific keyword for
Google Play know that that I'm sorry key
phrase the hipster song with the
whistling because they put that in an ad
and I tried a whole bunch of other
descriptions for songs that I thought
were pretty good it didn't work at all
do you try the one the Russian guy that
goes by work yes we've done even on land
show before oh that's oh yeah yeah it's
awesome okay sweet that's cool I'm
surprised that works actually it's a
great song you know the song talk yes
it's called like 7,000 by Vitas yeah out
I think that's bait that was my tooth
that's what I want so people in Chad are
saying that it's like basically a shield
TV but in a small compact dongle but I
think it does a little bit and plus the
price point those things are a box oh
yeah so this is probably gonna be way
cheaper the shield will also be able to
like cast games to your TV which is like
you're in a little bit different of a
range there the shield also has a voice
controllable remote easiest way to think
about it is gonna be there are already
android TV boxes it's just gonna be that
with a google assistant integration and
voice remote people in chat I'm guessing
that the price point would be like 120
130 boxes out how much a fire TV stick
is let me search the american internets
yeah where these things exist oh my well
you do that fire truck no they know from
last tech tips
what did you guys think about the fire
pole video good god it's $30 fire TV
stick with Alexa Boyce remote 30 bucks
that's really cheap even the 4k one is
only fifty a 4k chromecast is like 70 US
isn't it I don't know holy Google some
more yeah do it do it you can get a
chromecast on Amazon I can't you wasn't
that the whole thing that they argued
about before
can you do it now though because I know
they're arguing about it but I don't
know if it's like already an option oh
that got pretty settled in auto-filled
oh yeah I see a shield they selling it
NVIDIA shields for $200 gamepad though
yeah because you can play android games
on it some of them I guess yeah I'm
totally gonna sell my chromecast and get
one of these dollars if it comes out
they're probably gonna announce it at IO
IO is in a month it's in May Google IO
it's gonna be sweet oh you work on this
heck yeah
yeah okay I thought so so while you're
looking that up I'm gonna do a little
float plane moment 70 bucks says I have
270 okay okay so it is a little bit more
expensive flow plate has awesome stuff
on it Kyle from bit wit currently has
cool cooler is cool what happens if we
if we remove the fans it's a be quiet
cooler that should be a pretty
interesting video also he has a 32 by 9
gaming setup that he wants to show off
in a different video
- tech tips has a wearable cows cows
I've merged keyboard and mouse it is a
cow's like that was by accident but I'm
kind of down with it it's so can you
tell me a tiny amount but what this
thing actually is so it's these rings
that you were on your fingers yeah if
you lay your hand on a table okay it's a
mouse oh you don't and you just put your
wrist on the edge of the table and you
tap on a table it's a keyboard and it
can no based on like if you stretch your
finger or whatever it's not spatial it's
not like ease over here and peace over
here okay you actually have to learn a
bunch of gestures like it's like that's
a that's n oh yeah okay I learned it all
can you tell you properly that way I can
type how fast I can survive probably
dial up okay okay that's cool though
I don't need sweet I like it a lot and
it's good at what it's doing I guess it
doesn't register I'm not gonna give away
the video no yeah don't go any further
perfect there's also the continuation of
the Apple fiasco with the iMac Pro
buying a video card without getting
screwed and some other cool stuff like
the history of the motherboard I haven't
seen that video I'm going to watch that
video because I grew up with these super
janky weird motherboard setups and I
grew up with like my dad's computer
where basically to build the computer
you had to have a whole bunch of add-in
cards because the motherboard was so
bare and it didn't have like like you
didn't have on board Nick okay he didn't
have on board land for Ethernet
connections he had to have a NIC card in
order to have connection I remember when
we bought our first computer my mother
like I remember being in the shop when
we were buying it and it was like for
hours and we like bought a sound card
yeah like that's just totally integrated
you didn't have audio onboard probably
yeah so like that I'm 100 in certain to
that is going to be a sick video so be
sure to check that out check out flow
plate you go to flow plane comm and sign
up there or you can do it through the
forum but we are moving over to flow
plane calm and honestly the payment
system of open comm works way better so
if you want to have less issues I would
probably go there yeah but it only
sports credit card right now we will be
supporting paypal in the future but
crypto currencies no kitties kitties
yeah well you can hear a flow plane for
a single crypto kitty what is the crypto
kitty what you don't know what crypto
kitties is something worth describing
it's like come and gone this is like a
four month old is it like a meme it's
like a it's like a Syrian based game
where you trade digital kitties I didn't
I didn't watch it go by are you telling
you to suck off I just
there we go I think we've completed our
ritual we didn't get to watch that but I
think we're in sync I think so yeah
I noticed when mine was like going down
that yours was going down at the same
time and stuff and I was like I saw in
the corner in that smile yeah oh you did
this mommy too thing as later okay okay
that movie was amazing I just have to
say that let's get back on topic though
actually no let's do add spots we might
as well do energy you know yes a whole
yes correct synergy - synergy is a mouse
and keyboard sharing software so you can
have multiple computers even multiple
different types of computers like a
laptop and a desktop and you could have
like Linux on one of them and Windows or
Mac or whatever and you could share your
mouse and keyboard across all of them it
doesn't even matter which mouse and
keyboard use you can even use a cows
yeah yes I want to make and now it with
synergy one you had to have like one of
the computers set up as a server and I
think that was the one that had to have
the most people work plugged into it and
then you had like all the client boxes
all okay so all that's been massively
simplified it doesn't really matter
which one you have this stuff plugged
into you can share it across all of them
it's like super simple now there's SSL
encryption so you don't have to worry
about someone like taking over your
stuff which would be not great just you
know not good in general you can even
use a Raspberry Pi now which is pretty
nuts they've fixed issues with
reconnecting all the computers after one
of them goes to sleep they fixed issues
where redundant connections were being
created between machines which would
also be not necessarily good things
things are great if you have multiple
computers if you go to work with a
laptop and then bring it home and want
to be able to put it on your desk and
easily transfer files from one to the
other just by dragging and dropping from
one desktop to the other one and just
really nice seamless stuff like that
check out oh I guess seamless seamless
comm / synergy / plan 5 use the use of
the 5 yeah it's important when PI also
speaking of Kyle's video on flow plane
we've got be quiet they're a sponsor of
the show
you can check out their der croc Pro 4
and they're not as pro but still pretty
cool dark rock for itself the dark rock
4 and dark rock Pro 4 CPU coolers
include virtually inaudible silent wings
135 millimetre PWM fans it achieves a
quiet 21 point 4 DB at maximum fan speed
which is actually pretty Swick smells
pretty good in there too oh my you know
ok a slight tangent while we're on the
topic sorry be quite put mouse pads
smell terrible when you first take them
out of the box but anyways we're going
after they this is pretty bad smells
like a tire yeah that's looking like
this smell of fingertips not that
interesting ok it supports an additional
120 millimeter fan clips are included in
the scope of delivery there's a brushed
aluminum top cover which looks pretty
nice it like covers up the the fin stuff
so that's what you see inside your PC we
can replace my face with it now I'm like
the man with the Apple in front of his
face anyways moving on there's a three
year manufacturer warranty which is
great and and yeah if you need a CPU
cooler check them out there on Newegg
and other websites but we have links for
Newegg which will be in the video
description on youtube moving on

boom the beginning of the end of
passwords yes so there could be a future
soon where you very very seldom enter a
password which would be dope
because password stuck and so what
happened is there's this there's this
new security standard called web often
like authentication yeah that's so
stupid
it's weird thanks guys I thought it was
a typo at first like you know I was like
oh it appears more than once oh you
didn't account for people saying this
out loud
okay well web often has one near final
approval from the World Wide Web
Consortium which is the governing body
for these kinds of standards so what
this is is on your phone you're
unlocking your phone with face ID or
with your fingerprint all the time right
but you don't do that when you go to
facebook.com or basically any other
website all recipes for them you enter
in just a password and setting up a face
biometric password on all different
websites would take a long time you'd
have to not only would they have to
implement that that technology but then
you'd have to like do your all those
different finger taps on every different
finger for every website and that'd be
really annoying so what this is is it's
an API and the application programming
interface that all the different web
sites will will hook into and then you
only have to set up your biometric
passwords once and then the whole web
can rely on them which is gonna be be a
yes so for hackers all you really need
to do is break one system yeah then you
get all of them yes
SiC I might be wrong but this is how I
think it works because the I had to do
some some digging beyond just what was
found on the forum the forum post by the
way was posted by Matthew villian Thea
thank you very much thank you Matt
you sound Italian but Valencia that's
Spanish sounding to me I'm really bad so
you're probably totally right it could
be really yeah I don't know it's it
sounds like it could be cool it sounds
like it could be a single point of
failure it just depends on I guess how
they exactly implement it you can
require something like a Yubikey which i
think is actually pretty cool so if they
if they add power to the user in terms
of like oh I'm okay with fairly weak
authentication and you want to go that
route that's fine I don't care if
someone doesn't really care about their
accounts that's okay if you have one
password for everything and you think
that's okay
that's fine as long as it's in your
control to amplify that and have more
security well if you want to go to like
having two factors still like a Yubikey
and something else that could be pretty
cool well you kind of already have a
single point of failure like if someone
were to get my phone which they unlock
with a fingerprint or they were to get
my laptop and unlocking the password
then I have all those autocomplete set
up so they kind of have everything
anyway see but then that's that's in
your control thing yes mine doesn't if
someone got my phone yeah if they have
access to not very much I don't have
access to my email which is pretty bad
and I guess they would have I but they
don't have access to like my password
trove and nothing autocompletes mm-hmm
but they would have my email so they
could probably reset most things but
like yeah but even if even if you're the
kind of person you like doesn't care
about things wouldn't those like how are
they gonna get ahold of your of your
biometric information isn't that just
hashed isn't it totally yeah but okay so
the there's there's different types of
of hacking so you could find a
vulnerability in the system that no
longer requires you to use those sure
yeah okay right things yeah it's and and
someone will probably find one of those
okay whether it ends up on zero day and
gets solved or whether it gets sold or
what happens with it who knows and
having one central system if it's open
source and you have a whole bunch of
huge companies working on making sure
that it stays secure could be really
awesome and could like really lock
things down one thing that's awesome
about this is if you're not even that
savvy or serious about your privacy
you're more protected with this because
you can't be fished with this because
your password is like a secret that you
know and just because no one else knows
it doesn't mean that they can't get it
just by asking you what it is which is
what phishing is you know you get but my
wife actually got an SMS recently that
was like your your telco has given you a
refund or your ISPs giving you a refund
of 114 dollars and 61 cents click
through you click through and it's got
tiles for each of the common banks in
Canada totally branded looks totally
professional looks awesome and you just
you click on that and it's like you
enter your banking credentials and then
boom they have everything if she didn't
explicitly know like this is P never
text me they never text me and they have
no reason to give me a refund but like
how tempting is that like about free
money free money yeah anything's
possible with SMS login people get
fished all the time so you can't get
fish with this you still totally good
because if say it would just be done in
a different way because you would have
to have it capture your authentication I
guess so
it because you're saying this is a
general API for everyone right so they
would be so you would go to the phishing
site and it would be like scan your
fingerprint and you like click when you
have to when you get like it on Android
or iOS wouldn't you get a permission
prompt that was like share your
fingerprint with this website and you'd
be like that's weird I already did that
and then even if you did say yes that
they'd scan your fingerprint it would
just be once which may not be enough to
like totally get so your bank may not be
enough I don't know it's it still might
work it's potential you could also
algorithm it out to like angle it
slightly to try to make it slightly
different and honestly I would honestly
think most people would go like oh yeah
go away to any prompt that's like do you
want to share this with the website
heard me it's it's still possible
there's there's phishing attempts that
succeed that are super garbage all the
time and there's actually some people
who intentionally make things like
phishing attempts that are really bad
because they don't want to get savvy
people so they actually weed out savvy
people by making it fairly obviously
fake so if someone does fall for it they
can probably get way more from them
they're really gullible yeah there's
there's amazing the the world of people
trying to benefit off of other people is
vast and well it that actually is a
pretty good segue into another thing
that happened which is this ransomware
that asks yeah pub G ransomware it's
like your data is encrypted the only way
to get it back is to play this video
game like we're not affiliated just play
because it's awesome or if you don't
want to do that just enter the password
that's actually written right here on
the screen so just look at just like a
joke
I don't know maybe someone just wanted
definitely maybe it's a viral marketing
campaign it's obviously like bad and
stuff iral to virus it's a viral
marketing yeah that's pretty good I like
that I didn't pick up on there anyway
first it's it's obviously like bad and
stuff but I think it's hilarious I I
think this is very funny just play pub G
for one hour and apparently you don't
even have to you just launch the game at
all it's just that's what happens yeah
when you launch it it and the or restore
code is and you can just type that in I
think it's I think it's funny it's it's
I mean I'm not condoning it a good thing
all that kind of stuff but I just I
think it's hilarious I was like kind of
hoping it was gonna happen to me just
like wow I guess I gotta play
gee honey our data look it's date night
ignore that code yeah I have to say that
I have to save the pictures although all
the family pictures are all super
important yes family my family videos my
family BR videos yes of course
apparently warranty sticker stickers
that say yeah the sticker you're going
to your voyant tias ward you know what
I'm talking about this is supposed to
buy Steve Grabowski on the forum and the
previous topic was posted by no one
a Grabowski thanks for the topic yes
warranty void if removed that sticker
apparently is bullshit and illegal so
the FTC is cracking down they've sent
letters to six major companies they
haven't said who these companies are but
they're big and they're in the sectors
of their car manufacturers of cars they
are did I even write it down yeah here
we go automobile all cellular devices
and video game systems makers like I'm
pretty sure they're big companies like
so yeah yeah so they've sent warning
letters to these companies writing that
statements that consumers must use
specified parts or service providers to
keep their warranties is actually
illegal and it has been since 1975 and
we've kind of always sort of known this
likely always okay okay
but it's--but so okay maybe I shouldn't
say we have but like a lot of people
have been on this side and kind of known
this for a long time but that being said
because there hasn't been a big public
statement that's super easy to point out
like this there is you can point out
like really old laws and whatever but
most companies just act on the idea that
it that it is enforceable so we'll make
it a nightmare to actually get your
stuff repaired to the point where it's
not worth it I think even if even if the
case was that like you know I'm gonna
take the sticker off and there's nothing
the company can do and they're gonna
have to
honor the warranty anyway just the fact
that they have the sticker on there and
are deterring a large part of the
population even that is getting crack
down on it which is good because that's
sicker like you're right deters a huge
percentage of population basically
almost everyone and then even if it
doesn't like I love breaking those
stickers if I did want a warranty repair
for something that I broke the sticker
on it would be a nightmare and probably
not worth my time and it would probably
never end up happening and to get it
fixed I'd probably have to take them to
court which is not going to be worth it
so this being enacted is awesome I love
it it's great this is good one quote
that I like here is from Thomas B Paul
acting director of the FTT FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection he said
proficient provisions that tie warranty
coverage to the use of particular
products or services harm both consumers
who pay more for them as well as the
small businesses who offer competing
products and services you know like if
there's a say a Mac store that's not max
certified but the people there yeah they
know how to fix them those people should
be able to start businesses and fix up
these computers yeah I completely agree
the right to repair you know let's not
waste as much stuff sounds good to me
home baud no I mean like that's do that
I know let's do it I'm down this is this
is interesting Apple hasn't been what's
the last thing that Apple released that
was a new product air pods okay yeah no
you got me immediately well that goes
out the window I was thinking like
they're what they're watched hasn't done
very well their home pod now hasn't done
very well but you're right air pods have
done great but they okay they are
suppose to watch gain steamed has gains
gained steam it has yeah yeah okay
everyone knows it's the best SmartWatch
out there I mean it's not saying okay
but do people care about me exactly do
people care about smartwatches no no the
category is is still yeah pretty niche
so here's the story with the home pods
when they was when the pre-orders went
out that weekend the the sales of like
the pre-orders there for the home pod
accounted for seven
3% of all smart speaker sales that
weekend and for the first month I
believe it was 10% of the market
basically the market share of home pawed
relative to other smart speakers like E
Amazon echo and Google home is abysmal
and shrinking ahead hey a depressing
rate if at first it looked like the home
pod might be a hit pre-orders were
strong in the last week of January it
grabbed about a third of the u.s. smart
smart speaker market in unit sales but
by the time home pod arrived in stores
sales were tanking during the first 10
weeks they had 10% of the smart speaker
market but three weeks after launch
sales slipped to about four percent that
we it didn't help that they miss the
entire holiday season and that when they
did ship they were missing two critical
features that they're gonna have to wait
for Apple AirPlay to before they have
which is gonna be like July or something
all that notwithstanding the end result
here is that Apple has actually slashed
the quantity that they're ordering from
their suppliers now from 500,000 units
to 200,000 units and the people who are
working like anecdotally I guess you
know employees at Apple stores are
saying that like yeah we sell like 10 of
these a day like they're not really
flying off the shelf which is
interesting because that quite a few
stores 10 a day would be pretty good so
I don't know what yeah who said that
because if that was at Pacific Center
like in Vancouver it's like damn yeah we
sell like ten iPhones a day yeah yeah
yeah exactly but yeah and like yeah
there's a little Apple section of the
local Best Buy and like if they sold 10
home pod today they'd be so amazed and
ties to be undone like sleeves would be
rolled over getting trampled so it
really like I don't know if they have 10
customers a day at that Apple thing
they're stoked so like it depends on the
scale of where you're dealing with but
essentially they're not selling very
well so there's a rumor here I believe
it's just a rumor I mean it's definitely
just a rumor I just don't know how how
like authoritative that rumor is but
yeah people are saying that now that
could be considering making a smaller
home pod I guess it would be cheaper
because I mean it's a pretty competitive
market smoke yeah this isn't a Bluetooth
speaker but Bluetooth speakers are
totally totally commodity by now and the
thing with smart speakers is Apple is
the only one that's not decoupled from
their own proprietary device like you
can get Sonos I have or you will be soon
so knows that have Google assistant in
them yeah you can get sona's to have
alexa in them there's some devices have
Amazon Alexa as well as Google assistant
in them oh my gosh you know so almost is
gonna be like that soon and I believe
there's a company that I think it's
called the wand and it's on its way here
that does that how cool is that to
address Alexa and then address I said it
to dress her and then address Google
home
oh yeah for whatever you want like
that's awesome anyway here's a few
reasons why I don't think it's true that
Apple is making a smaller home pod and
maybe I'll be wrong but I don't think it
makes very much sense because when you
make a speaker that's cheaper they give
you think about the echo and the echo
dot everything about the Google home and
the Google mini the thing that makes it
cheaper and smaller is that they've
compromised on sound quality like yeah
the Google mini doesn't have the
speakers that the bigger one does but
with the home pod that's the only thing
that the home pod does well is the sound
quality so if they got rid of the sound
quality all you'd have left is all the
reasons why home pod isn't doing well
you'd have a crappy assistant that
doesn't do that much stuff yeah so why
would you buy that you wouldn't so it
doesn't make any sense
I think if they are doing that I think
it would speak to the like post Steve
Jobs Apple and like I don't know if they
are doing that and if they're not I
think that would make more sense so I'm
not saying this is necessary what's
happening but all the Apple with Steve
Jobs not all the old Apple without him
or older Apple with it I mean like the
the like third one not the fourth one
that we're currently in it
Madhu manded know this is the right way
do it if they make something they would
have been like no this is what people
should have and people will learn that
we're right eventually or whatever and
everything that they would make would
make tons of money and make sense and
even if it didn't sell a huge amount the
first time they made it they would just
make another one which is a linear
improvement well I'm going from there I
think you can categorize that by eras
and a tribute to Steve Jobs but I think
a lot of it is more attributed to just
the maturation of the more that
particular market category and now
there's lots of different iPhones
because the smartphone market is just
way more mature in terms of speakers
though like their their market strategy
now is like we're a hardware company
whose principal product the smartphone
is under attack at all sides and being
commoditized so what we're gonna do
instead because we can't get more iPhone
customers is we're just gonna get more
money from our existing customers
through all these kind of ancillary
products like air pods and the home pod
so we're gonna make a speaker that's
really good and we're gonna get another
three hundred fifty dollars from each of
our existing customers that's wicked I
don't think they're gonna compromise on
that I don't think they're gonna say you
know what
instead of getting $350 from our
customers we're gonna get 150 with this
like weak-ass home pod yeah because then
who's gonna get the expensive one it
makes a lot more sense to me for them to
spend their resources on making the home
pod that already exists more attractive
why don't they just make it you know
focus on the ecosystem focus on the the
integration with more smart homes stuff
makes Siri better and makes Siri better
if you can at this point
yeah and that's gonna impact all your
other products as well I think focusing
on the ecosystem for them is is what
they're gonna do is that's consistent
with those strategy that they're using
today
I think this rumor is bunk I think the
first person to make a very personalized
assistant is gonna start winning me over
pretty fast when it's like actual
conversational oh yeah that would win a
scarlet johansson CH like sap like from
is that is that hurt hurt yeah yeah have
you seen now why him stop why him yeah
yeah it's a James Franco movie no I
haven't
yeah yeah there's a there's a virtual
assistant in that movie that's totally
totally cloak you like it fights with
you inside yeah perfect yeah like I I'm
correct no seriously though like I want
it to be like you're late
wake up yeah yeah then what I'm like no
I want Susan get up yeah and like it cuz
it gets used to the fact that I've a
hard time waking up so it becomes a
little bit more aggressive sort of tries
to give me up like I I want one that
learns Who I am I would honestly mostly
prefer that it was local and didn't have
to call back to outside servers and
would just use my own stuff so if
someone makes one of those I'll spend
exorbitant Mouse money and I'll make
that work if it's like good but they
won't so that's okay but yeah now
that'll happen eventually come on Scott
it I mean if we're talking like sue for
a long term yeah
what do you mean this isn't this is 10
years 10 years until you have a local
one that's actually as good as the other
ones I'm talking yeah I'm talking like
okay conversational will definitely
happen yeah and I'm but knowing about
you and dealing with you the only data
they need for that is data from you so
why wouldn't that be local because they
want all of it though I got confused for
a second but it's because they want all
of that data so they can train the rest
of their their devices and stuff and so
they can take things from it for the
most point but yeah because they want
that data oh there's another like
diskettes get one more in here okay
speaking of Google basically there's
some leaks of where the heck did I put
this there's a new gmail coming in the
next couple weeks and it has some cool
new features yeah some what data mining
is profitable basically yeah this looks
awesome not only does the aesthetic oh
it looks kind of cool or more Android
but it has this new feature of like
confidential emails so there's like a
little lock icon you can hit and when
you hit that lock icon your email gets
all these new properties such as the
recipient can no longer forward that
email they can't download it they can't
print it obviously they can take a
screenshot because nothing take a
screenshot or even if you somehow block
that because there
native OS they could just take another
thing yeah sure sure for sure you'll
never get past that it disables copy and
paste and it lets you make it explode so
you can make the email itself expire
after like a week or a month or a year
or multiple years and when that happens
so there are other services that have
these kind of properties already the
program notably is protonmail if a
protonmail user sends an email or a
message to another protonmail user and
insects loading message when it explodes
it just disappears from both of our
boxes it's like it's just gone the way
it works or is probably gonna work with
the new Google one is if you're the
recipient you're gonna get an email
looks like a normal email you're gonna
open that email and it's gonna have a
link to the confidential email so when
it expires I think it's just that link
that expires an email like line item
will still be here in your inbox when
you click that link you're gonna have to
enter your Google credentials again
which is pretty sweet cuz then if
someone stole your laptop and just had
access to your email because you left it
open they still wouldn't have access to
that that can't confidential email and
you can also stipulate that they need to
enter like a two-factor thing like a SMS
when when they get that email to just
increases security if someone steals
your device and figures out your pattern
or your code or whatever and can get
into it like we were talking earlier
like my passwords would still be locked
but emails auto log-in so if all my
emails had this thing or all the
important ones had this thing that would
add a lot of security and you can make
it so that the expiration date like you
saying it explodes you can make us say
the expiration date is like multiple
years so if it's something that that
person is gonna have to go back to it
multiple times yeah well you could make
it so that the expiration date is like
way way down the line yeah it also says
etc so I could see a potential situation
where it just doesn't ever explode but
has all the other security features like
you have to go through that like you
have to reload in yeah all that kind of
stuff so you can do it you could do it
for just high security emails in general
which is really cool
it doesn't just have to be stuff that is
gonna delete if you're an accountant you
could tell your clients like hey some
send me or your stuff just make it
explode in seven years
cuz you I don't need it legally after
that time and I don't want to be a
holding your data in my storage service
yeah I mean it wouldn't be theirs anyway
but yeah whatever I think that'd be cool
it's Friday night
and speaking of Friday night I think
that's the end of the show I'm not a
duck juice yeah that means it's over I
