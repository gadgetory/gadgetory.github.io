you want to go to warehouse now and
start doing water cooling and then we'll
head out okay after let's go look for
water cooling and then yeah we can come
back both teams were given permission to
do their water cooling with stuff from
the Linus warehouse problem is Luke and
Linus didn't actually get the message so
the BS mods guys get the first crack at
it
tech showdown is brought to you by
synergy - in partnership with g.skill be
quiet and cable mod synergy - makes
sharing your mouse and keyboard between
multiple computers so simple that anyone
can use it
learn more at the link below we could do
cream accents with a brown base we have
to commit to something it's two o'clock
okay I don't think it's the greatest
idea the rat but like I think for us to
win this we really needed like a super
killer idea and I don't necessarily
think that we have one so let's do it so
let's get this banged out as fast as we
can do you want this kind of candy color
or do you want this kind of this kind of
candy color okay here's here's the crazy
idea I'm sorry I'm changing gears on you
again that's weird but if this is around
could we use the gold caps and do the
face brown
but that would be that would match the
fee that would match the color scheme
but not the overarching theme forget it
I I said it done the thing and we're all
gonna just forget it
Brandon wasn't recording that anyway
this is a pretty ambitious project that
we've put it in front of ourselves
everything's flat we're fucking you know
we're gonna lose right let's just try
not to get humiliated I don't want to
give them the satisfaction okay I'm just
gonna cry I think because that's
probably fair let's just give up let's
just take all the candy off the shelves
literally jam it into our Tower and
build a computer that could have to be
kind of cool I think we could make that
work a dark spin to Candyland the dark
side of candy and like the the like Dion
Candyland is like if we could illuminate
the Candyland sign I don't think that
would even be that hard and have the D
like kind of falling off and not
illuminated Oh God okay that is a lot of
work that's like two hours of work yeah
but the Candyland sign we're probably
pretty important okay what color green
no because it doesn't look like grass so
we get fake grass from somewhere and
then I'm not worried about the color too
much so we could just go with brown okay
so I think what we're gonna do is kind
of divide and conquer rather than trying
to tackle everything together we have
the general theme kind of figured out
Luke
kicked my ass with his diorama skills in
the second text showdown something like
that so Luke is in charge of making this
the well you guys like talk a little bit
or something you know
okay and then I am on transforming this
desktop surface and figuring out how the
scenery is going to work so I'm gonna
Home Depot he's gonna Michaels we're
both gonna look for some inspiration and
I'm like gonna roll with this vlogging
it up over there this dress right now so
I'm gonna get this finished so I got to
coat this I gotta figure out some paint
coatings for some other stuff since I'm
covering things I might as well figure
out this horrible zit on my nose now
that about a beer shot I'm finding this
place pretty oppressive I just got to
get out of here and working with Luke
the worst it's the worst
so we've stripped down the case we're
know we're painting it painting it
inside outside some accidents colors
pulled the tray out everything plastic
forever is gone we're gonna be doing
hardline water cooling hopefully two GPU
and CPU we also might use these gigantic
this is a 400 millimeter reservoir these
might be actually mounted onto the desk
and not inside the computer which will
bring the hardline across the computer
in the desk and tie the whole thing
together
so we don't have an actual plan really
but we made it look like we did element
we we just wanted them to sweat a little
bit so we when we get a good mod it's
usually revolves around a lot of
elements so we're trying to just develop
each key element is some of the things
we know that we're gonna use we're gonna
have we got to have movement right we
know that we're gonna do some big candy
like giant well we hope if as long as we
can find them okay we want some big
giant yeah lollipop whatever things
we're gonna of course light the
underside of the desk we're gonna try to
use the sawhorse desk parts we're gonna
try to close those with acrylic and then
we were probably gonna do something with
some sort of signage or a whole front
skirt on the front of the desk and do
some sort of signage like call it
something-something candy shop like
women twinning winning team candy shop
we just ran into an empty plant right
here and so we know that our competition
is in the store so we're gonna let some
air out of their tires to slow them down
just a little bit you know I just I
thought this was gonna be like you know
a by the rules competition these guys
just keep camping it up in my aisle here
camping it up in my aisle they're trying
to scope out the competition
Chaz if you guys have anything worth
hiding okay that's good we are so fucked
just five that's the under side like
it's fine okay so I have a little bit of
this gold left I don't think it's enough
so I bought another one but we can
return that if we don't need it this was
just in my car don't worry about it
ignore that so this is I believe the
same gold but new it's not the same at
all so that's cool these are these are
rollers so what I think I'm actually
gonna do is I'm gonna go chocolate brown
on the edges and green turf on the top
so the desk actually has like a two-tone
look and then do you want to do
chocolate brown for the legs too ah not
necessarily I still think we should get
the wrapping paper which it just
occurred to me we appear to already
actually have oh okay so I wonder if we
can just borrow that here's a white
there's actually a bright red spray balm
in the workshop right now okay check out
my toy store haul as well okay one quick
thing I got the fondue machine they
didn't really want me to vlog in the
store so here's my vlog getting the
fondue machine I also got a bunch of
multiple chocolate for it oh yeah so
how's Matt guys yeah I figure we could
just like really cross that out and
write something else I think I think
this will be good
that's like accessories and stuff you
you have to buy them at like see their
heat sealed you have to buy them as like
sets this is just a bunch of extra stuff
so I have I have like a palette that's
cool and I have like a cage that goes
around it if we wanted to have like some
finished candy in there I have I tried
to get as much of this kind of this
could be like wasteland behind the
computer because I don't know what that
absolutely this could be yeah and then
our hazmat guys could work on that I got
the hazmat guys come with hatchets for
some reason so I bought them to throw in
some brooms for them so hazmat guys have
brooms now what they only came with
hatchets yeah I know right
we're like pickaxes or whatever you
would call that remaining plutonium with
pickaxes yeah sure why not
so right so this is the like area behind
it or whatever and these guys are like
working on it or whatever yeah cool I
love that so we should leave us to like
a fairly significant amount of space
behind the computer if we can okay maybe
the behind the computer isn't even
hidden on an angle behind it it's like
beside it over here and then Candyland
is over there cool that's good you sound
worried I'm worried I'm like I could not
possibly be more worried right now we
are we're gonna get our ass I think them
being allowed to do like super crazy
multi loop water cooling and us not is
like not really fair oh I don't think
that matters I think that's a complete
waste of time
super matters oh no way are you kidding
me
what yeah but remember like he's gonna
go wow there's his water cooled yours is
not your club
absolutely we are not allowed yeah doing
it now is probably an issue yeah even
then I don't think look I think if we
try to go head to head that's for the
keyboard if we try to go head to head
those are stupid like hardline
water-cooled build versus hardline
water-cooled build we're gonna get our
asses kicked anyway they're gonna do a
better job of it right so we're better
off executing our style better
then they would execute their style or
not better than funner and I know fun is
not a word but that was sort of my point
we're the funner team you know it's like
we don't really get it but we seem nice
you know one of our shirts don't fit
yeah we're going for the sympathy vote
Brandon where do you want this lens
synergy to is designed to be easier and
more seamless to use than synergy one
features include sharing from anywhere
with automatic control of any other
computer without reconfiguring SSL
encryption to protect your keystrokes
from attackers dynamic networking so it
detects the best route based on your
setup and being able to always run in
the background on all your operating
systems so you can set and forget and it
even works across VPNs and tricky home
networks if you get the pro version you
can get access to other cool features
too like clipboard sharing dragging and
dropping files copy pasting lock screen
synchronization and lots more
got some nice piece thanks Brad still
live we got stuff from the candy shop
stuff that stuff our chalkboard that we
talked about enjoyed we got some of
these lights right here that we're gonna
use above and below RGB yeah RGB you
everything all the stuff and then our
sparkly stuff with Georgia we got some
sparklers glitter glue stick things and
then all they associated like you know
supplies paint rollers that kind of crap
nothing too exciting so alright let's
get moving
go in there yeah we're running out of
that back you don't have to worry about
the edge so diesel yeah
by the time I gotta clean up a toast
okay okay we're happy to do that in the
morning okay all right so and what I can
tell those guys haven't done anything
that looks good so yeah we could just
wait a whole nother day don't touch that
because it's not secured in any
meaningful way okay
the idea evolved from a flowing river of
chocolate that the user can consume into
having it be like like a candy place
themed into having some things maybe be
wrapped in foil but then be chocolate
inside and then into now the tower is a
factory and outside is like where the
workers harvest the materials to make
candy look I can't even stand up what
well no that's fine we'll just hot glue
everything I mean all of those changes
occurred within a span of a couple of
hours meaning that there's been very
little decisive action and very little
time to act on it wait the decisive
action is the action I mean this is what
this is what I'm talking about because
we get fun you know like that's what
this project is supposed to be about
it's not supposed to be all like serious
who can build the best you know modded
computer or whatever look at these guys
are like so I don't have the paint booth
set up right now which means that this
is pretty much our best bet
like people white
this isn't ideal talk tape talk to hit
me with the talk tape
nice throw okay
they're measurement of a good day
how much painting you can do maybe it
isn't about painting I'm gonna spring
into action springing into action for
day two let's get on this first things
first I need to get another coat of my
stain on here got my got my dark brown
stain I got one here you know got other
ones that I can't show you cause it's
too hot for TV I mean that's hot to some
people I think like maybe we could do
like brick Street kind of deal and use
like KitKat bars and have the
wheelbarrow there and they're like
laying them out on top like GPU or
something totally cool this is honestly
not the one I wanted they didn't have
the one I wanted in stock but I think
it'll get the point across it's probably
good enough yeah so I'm gonna work on
getting this while you finish
disassembling
I'm gonna work on getting this cut out
and I want it to line up as perfectly
along the sides as we can get away with
I've reflected a lot last night and I'm
coming into today feeling a lot better
actually today is a fresh day it doesn't
have to be affected by the failures of
yesterday so this is what we call the
comfort surface I think we need a most
pad or else we'll lose some points
because their comfort surface is like
exceptionally uncomfortable yeah oh it's
not exception I mean it's a little uncle
you definitely read mark your hand like
real fast
this has to come off and I need to do
some more staining
tell me objectively does it look bad
like no and you're gonna cover it anyway
so what does it matter
okay while Luke and lioness are going
with brown the other team is getting
started with good old-fashioned white
hopefully their plan for painting won't
be as big of a letdown as it was in
scrap yard Wars yeah son I just finished
cleaning off all the stickers that were
on the case so we could paint where
those were and then just kind of wiped
it down with dinner to get it ready to
paint okay so I got full coverage on the
first coat I'm gonna let that sit and it
might take a couple hours I'm not sure
how to get these grates off of some of
these parts but I'm working on it
great did it yes will make it great
again
we need to jury-rig ourselves some way
to hang things once we're done painting
them honestly Luke I think a good enough
paint job plus our X Factor could be
enough to do this maybe because I
honestly don't think the judges are
gonna look that closely at the paint the
biggest mistake yesterday was not just
like going with something and then just
like frantically doing it I think that's
what we need to do for the next three
days well that's yeah yeah I don't know
if I agree on the first part but that is
what we need to do now there's kind of a
wild card here because like I really
didn't see this team assignment coming I
mean literally no one did something not
even cool yeah oh yeah you were here for
that right yeah Colton's like what that
doesn't make any sense
I'm not gonna be the kid on the
schoolyard that wins about the teams I'm
gonna be the kid on the schoolyard who
makes the best of his crappy team
Lucan Linus might have a shot at making
up for their slow start they're going
full speed ahead with whatever half big
idea they have but will it be enough
find out next time on tech showdown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
