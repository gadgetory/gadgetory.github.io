2017 this year if you want to check out
their skins check the link below this
ladies and gentlemen is the iBUYPOWER
snowblind if you watched our intel top
three desktops of pax west 2016 you
would have seen linus just scream about
it but this is so freakin cool multiple
times I can't look away from it it's so
amazing and this is so cool he did that
with actually pretty good reason it's
genuinely quite amazing so how does the
world's most fantastical side panel
actually work well it's straight up a
monitor it's a 5 by 4 1280 by 1024 19
inch screen that they take the back off
and I believe a cleanroom I'm just going
to assume that and then mount it in here
meaning that you have to do the
backlighting yourself meaning that if
you open the side panel it's
ridiculously bright in there the amount
of like LED light that they have to have
is pretty intense and also one thing
that I want to note is that all of the
colors of the LEDs will be matched this
one like a little bit more yellowy one
will be replaced don't worry about that
the production model will look fine that
may sound relatively easy to do but it's
not especially not as cleanly as they
have done it they have their own little
box inside that takes the control stuff
from the monitor that powers the monitor
that sends the DVI cable out the back of
the computer so that can go back into
your graphics card because again it's a
screen you can configure what's on here
right now they have this really cool
rainmeter setup and they show the
iBUYPOWER logo or the intel logo and the
like CPU usage the little iBUYPOWER
chimera down there and the time up at
the top along with the date and whatnot
you could set up your own rainmeter
setup or you can just use theirs that
comes with it and they have this really
cool default graphic but they will be
having others and they're gonna be
running a campaign online so if you go
to their social media and check it out
you might be able to try to submit some
of your ideas
now the snowblind is the case but it's
iBUYPOWER so you'll be buying an entire
system this one right here is pretty
spectacles with an i7 7700 k gtx 1070 16
gigs of DDR 4 RAM a 240 gigabyte SSD a
one terabyte hard drive
five and at 800 watt power supply with
its own custom white cabling which looks
pretty slick and this units entire
hopeful targeted price is $17.99 meaning
that the panel does not cost a thousand
dollars like Linus said in that previous
video it's closer to about a 250 dollar
adder you may also notice that most of
stuff inside is like silver or white and
even their own iBUYPOWER logo in the
back is white as well with a little bit
of grey on there that is all by design
and if you go through the configurator
you're going to have to pick white or
gray things which should be pretty easy
as a lot of stuff on the market right
now that looks really cool it's actually
in like a white black or gray stylized
design so it shouldn't be too bad they
have air cooler options if you want to
go with that but they all need to be
white or gray so they reflect the light
inside the case again they need a lot of
light in there now you might be
wondering about the resolution yeah the
aspect ratio is a little bit off but
that makes sense because they have to
fit it to a side panel not a like wide
format screen but the resolution did
seem a little low as well that's for
good reason
one the individual pixels are larger
which would generally be worse for a
standard screen that you're looking at
but is better in this case because it
allows more light per pixel which makes
it easier to see and so that it will pop
a little bit better which is actually
very helpful and the density isn't
higher meaning that the like amount of
lines that have to grid in between all
of the pixels is lower which will look
better because if you look too closely
at it you can see all of those lines it
doesn't look as good if you guys are
interested in the snow blind be sure to
check it out this is easily the best
implementation of a side panel that I
have personally ever seen and I am
absolutely certain that it will be a
huge eye catcher on whatever desk you
decide to put it on Thank You 2d brand
for sending us here so I could check out
this case and check out everything else
that we've seen at CES 2017 this year if
you want to check out and configure
their skins you can do that down in the
description down below they have tons of
different options I have a marble scan
on my phone right now and I went with
like a Haunter theme on my laptop
originally it was a joker theme because
it was purple black and green and then
now I'm going to change the keyboard to
like a purple fire theme and go with
hunter I don't know it's pretty sick you
can see it in the Christmas video that
we filmed not way too long ago but yeah
check out D brand description down below
I'll see you guys the next video stay
