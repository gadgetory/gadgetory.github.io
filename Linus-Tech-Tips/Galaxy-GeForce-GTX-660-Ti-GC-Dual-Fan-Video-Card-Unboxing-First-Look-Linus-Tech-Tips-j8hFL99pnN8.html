geforce gtx 660ti factory overclock so
galaxy clocked edition 2 gig card with
custom cooling and therefore center
bracket supporting 3+1 display gaming
DirectX 11 physics 3d vision 3d vision
surround using in videos latest 28
nanometer manufacturing process which
gives you outstanding power efficiency
even compared to lower end lower
performing last generation products all
of the usual Kepler features including
adaptive vsync as well as TxAA FXAA so
these are new better either faster or
higher quality anti-aliasing methods
you've also got full support for GPU
boost which takes your let's say yeah
GPU boost which basically it lets your
graphics card clock itself at whatever
it needs staying within a certain power
and temperature threshold in order to
give you the best performance you it can
give you in any game that it wants to
give you that best performance in that
sort of petered out here the end but the
point is it's good it uses the same chip
as the GTX 670 and 680 so this is a GK
104 chip in here and NVIDIA hasn't even
really cut it down a lot so instead of a
256-bit memory interface it's using a
192 bit memory interface but the memory
is still clocked at 60 Hertz and the
core is still at the same clock speed as
a GTX 670 it's still got 2 gigs of
memory because NVIDIA has done some
funky Rikka jiggering with the memory
controller so that they can actually run
different density memory chips on
different I don't know I don't know if
channels is right but whatever they can
mix and match the density of the memory
chips in order to have a 192 bit bus but
in even 2 gigs of video memory instead
of 100 have seen in the past the first
time we saw this was on I think the 550
ti so so now we're seeing this on
high-end card
and this is truly a high-end part uses a
PCI Express 3.0 interface supports as I
mentioned before three plus one displays
using DVI HDMI and DisplayPort
it's got galaxies custom bracket on the
back which is gonna give you a little
bit more exhaust but in the case of a
card like this where most of the exhaust
is going to be around the card because
it's using an internal exhaust cooler as
opposed to an external exhaust cooler
it's not gonna make that much of a
difference it's got a dual SLI fingers
meaning this is yes a sixty level card
so like a four sixty five sixty six
sixty eighty I sixty level card that
supports 3-way SLI so fed in for a
moment
it supports truly high-end features this
custom card from galaxy has a six pin
and an eight pin power connector which
in theory should deliver more power to
the card if it needs it but it's
probably unnecessary given even the gtx
680 uses two six pins unless you buy the
galaxy card which does have the beefier
power delivery system
speaking of beefier power delivery
system the reference cards are using
that short PCB almost the same PCB as
the 670 i mean it uses the same chip and
it's clocked at the same clock speed and
it's clocked at the same memory speed
with the same amount of memory so it's
pretty similar but they had to redo it a
little bit for that mixed mixed two
density memory miss that's going on so
galaxy has not used that shortened PCB
they have done a beefier PCB with more
vrm components you can sort of see them
all here more cooling and more length so
it's the longer PCB on the galaxy card
and but it still uses these top mounted
power connectors so you shouldn't
shouldn't run into any sort of
obstructions sticking out power
connectors under the end of your card
this cooler is actually phenomenally
efficient so we compared it I've
actually already opened this card and
already tested it in benchmark didn't
sort of every way but whatever this card
this cooler actually is significantly
more efficient than the twin frozer for
cooler on the MSI power Edition card I
was really impressed by that it also
includes dust removal technology which
means it spins backwards for a few
seconds when you first boot up to blow
some of the dust out of the heatsink and
then turns around and spins properly
forward in order to give you the
school impossible speaking but that's
cooling possible because almost the
entire PCB surface has fans blowing down
on it you have great cooling not only
for the GPU core itself which has these
heat pipes carrying heat away from the
core out to the outer edges of the fins
but also great cooling for your memory
vrm components and whatever other things
you're gonna find on the card itself
this is a pre overclocked card but you
can still push it a little bit further
so we did manage to overclock this card
about another 90 megahertz on the core
which gave us again even more of a
performance boost once you start
overclocking the 660ti especially if you
can squeeze a little bit more out of the
memory performance gets amazingly close
to a GTX 670 now it's been true for
quite a few generations now that you can
take a 260 or and the 260 was sort of
pretty close to the 280 at the time
that's not the same as how a 460 was to
a 470 in a 480 but you could take a 260
and get it pretty close to 280
performance by overclocking same for 417
480 same for 570 and 580 same for 670
and 680 now we can take a 60 level card
and actually overclock it to nearly the
same performance as a 670 which has not
been something we've seen in the past
5-6 TTI's wouldn't be able to touch a
570 and the same goes for a 462 a 470 so
this is a very exciting card especially
given that it's $100 cheaper than a 670
and $200 cheaper than a 680 supporting
all those high-end features supporting I
mean low power consumption how do you go
wrong I guess have I run out of things
to say about it let's have a look at the
accessories so galaxy includes a couple
things like their card which I don't
know what they are yet DVI to VGA
adapter to do a molex for pin 2 600
right and sorry 1 is 2 8 pin 1 is the
6th in some kind of user's manual and no
driver disk download the latest from the
Nvidia website there you go they're
sending a message let's just finish up
with sort of some closer looks at C this
is part of why I think this could will
perform soil look how thick the fins are
they're using almost the entire dual
slot nosov the card in order to
either build fans around it or put like
massive sea look in between the two fans
they actually build it up a little bit
more just because they have a little bit
more space to throw in aluminum fins so
that's I I mean I don't think it's
anything about the design is more for
the aesthetic is more for the look so I
don't think it's anything about that
that makes it perform really well I
think they've just put a beast amount of
metal on this card to dicen 80
millimeter fans and it gets you know
cooled really well so thank you for
checking me on my unboxing and first
look at the galaxy geforce gtx 660ti and
