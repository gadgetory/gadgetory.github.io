sending us here this year that's
youtube.com slash kingston hyperx also
thank you to lynda.com and phantom glass
if you haven't heard of clev before
don't feel too bad they just founded the
company in 2014 and only had their first
consumer launch in January of 2015
down at PAX South but don't expect them
to stay small for long they're kind of a
big deal why are they a big deal well in
the DRAM I see space there's three big
main manufacturing players
there's micron who also sell their
products through crucial there's Samsung
who sells their products through Samsung
and then there's SK Hynix which up till
now didn't really do much in that space
clev is SK Hynix version of crucial to
micron there will definitely be some
difficulty along their path distribution
is an issue for everyone
but it shouldn't take them too long with
access to Hynix mfri sees they should
make a big splash soon enough first in
their lineup is their KRAS ddr4 sole
range in speeds of 2133 all the way up
to 3200 megahertz
starting at 1.2 volts and ranging all
the way up to 1.3 5 volts in kits of up
to 32 gigabytes next up is both the
genuine and urban ddr3 modules both of
these will range from 1600 megahertz to
3200 megahertz and from a voltage of 1.5
volts to 1.6 5 volts in kit sizes of 32
gigabytes the differences between these
two is that the urban comes without LEDs
and the genuine comes with LEDs in the
top and last that in this case least in
both performance and price is the neo
ranging in speeds of 1600 megahertz to
2400 mega Hertz voltages of 1.5 volts to
1.6 5 volts and a kit size of 32
gigabytes Brandon and I definitely had
to agree these are some of the most
attractive looking modules I've ever
seen in terms of memory very sleek
industrial and modern looking thank you
