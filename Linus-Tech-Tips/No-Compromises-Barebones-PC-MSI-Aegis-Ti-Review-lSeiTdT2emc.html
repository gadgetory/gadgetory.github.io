bare-bones gaming desktop from msi was
through this article on Tom's hardware
and I'm not sure why but I thought for
some reason that it was a compact SLI
gaming desktop so when it arrived in a
box the size of a small car the only
thing I could think was well I hope MSI
has packed a lot of innovation in there
because if the computer itself is that
big this thing is going to be pretty
hard to recommend
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description let's start with the
good news the ages Ti is very well
packed inside that enormous box so while
it's not really any smaller than I'd
expect a typical M ATX computer to be
it's also not larger to the point where
I feel like the engineering effort that
went into creating its non-standard
internals was a complete waste of time
maybe we'll see and I suppose that there
are aesthetic reasons for it too whether
you generally like the gamer look or not
you're likely to agree that the Aegis Ti
is striking the front along with its
solid i/o mix including a DVD Drive two
USB three ten gigabit ports one type C
and one type a a USB three five gigabit
port audio jacks and an HDMI
pass-through for VR Roxann RGB lit
aggressively postured design whose
helmet inspired grills windows and
emblems work together shockingly well
the top and sides are no different with
ample cooling vents a GPU window that
shows off the msi gtx 1070 gaming X
cards that I installed in SLI and a
solid metal carrying handle being the
standout features of the box that sits
on top of the bottom pedestal that
contains the included 850 watt 80 +
platinum power supply and two three and
a half inch hard drive bays with
pre-wired SATA power and data cables in
terms of rear i/o we've got a pretty
bog-standard layout here with the ps2
port being a welcome inclusion let's go
inside because from out here it's hard
to say much about YMS I felt the need to
do anything to the standard n ATX layout
in order to fit two graphics cards into
a machine this size and because my unit
is a bare-bones so we won't be doing
anything else with it until we open it
up and install a CPU Ram drives video
cards and an operating system so it
turns out the answer to why they needed
to do that
is
not ease-of-use for a bare-bones with a
custom chassis and motherboard this
thing is really not very easy to build
in some stuff is handled well two of the
DIMM slots and the two m dot 2 SSD slots
are crazy easy to access from the side
the hard drives in the bottom foot have
the cables pre run and the single tuna
1/2 inch SSD on the side though it
annoys me that they didn't include
hardware for the 2 others can be
installed in less than a minute but the
other third and fourth DIMM slots are on
the other side of the motherboard making
them awkward to reach with the CPU
cooler radiator installed though that's
honestly the least of my concerns
because you'll need to remove this
entire bracket which interestingly seems
to have enough room for a dual read if
you wanted to install your CPU anyway so
poor cable management and a lot of
things needing to be moved out of the
way is my biggest complaint down here
which leads us then to the video cards
they look simple slide the video card in
this way and oh wait a second those
aren't thumb screws how do I get a
screwdriver in here oh so I have to undo
these two screws for the top fascia undo
another 5 screws to open up this hinge
with the fan attached to it then I can
slide the optical drive forward to make
room to put the graphics cards in
finally install them plug in the again
poorly cable managed cables for PCI
Express power plug in the SLI bridges
and then Jam the optical drive back into
place and close it all up again I just
don't think that any of that would be
very intuitive for a new system builder
and in some ways I think it would be
even more difficult than building a
standard system from scratch
it's little things like the inclusion of
these ridiculously long SLI bridges
instead of a proper high bandwidth hard
bridge that's already at the right
spacing with MSI's own video cards
installed I'm forced to either have them
stick up and mash against that top grill
or go down and catch in the fan stuff
that doesn't look like it should go
together can be very confusing for the
target audience that I would think MSI
is trying to hit with a bare-bones
system and the bottom line here is that
11 screws is too many to swap out the
graphics cards
compare that to razor's core which is
tooless though it should be noted my
thumb screw was too tight to remove by
hand out of the box I ended up needing
to get a screwdriver and this feels like
a design from yesteryear from a user
friendliness perspective and while we're
at it then I might have suggested
straight HDMI connectors for that VR
pass-through thing firing up the bios
more lack of polish I remember seeing
MSI p67 boards that had a more elegant
UEFI interface than this one
the worst offender is the legacy boot
mode being grayed out and not working at
all in my shipping BIOS without doing
some configuration gymnastics and I
sincerely hope to see some improvement
here in the future with that said with
the actual assembly complete the story
gets quite a bit better cooling
performance is a wonderful and this
system with its four 120 millimeter fans
is really quiet CPU die attempts in the
neighborhood of 70 degrees even in a
toasty warehouse on a hot day with the
400 megahertz factory overclock enabled
by that big dragon button on the front
is nothing to sneeze at and the way that
MSI has separated my open air-cooled GTX
10 70s from the rest of the components
means that GPU boost speeds averaging
over 1800 megahertz in real world
applications were easily achievable so I
was running Crysis 3 at 4k and SLI for
the duration of this test which I guess
leads us well into performance then if
you've seen a slightly overclocked 6700
K with gtx 1070 sli none of this is
going to surprise you much but I think
the bigger conversation here is about
whether SLI makes sense at all right now
with the GTX 1080
be capable of handling pretty well
anything you can throw at it and the
future of multi-gpu pretty clouded right
now with the implementation being
largely up to game developers as they
switch over to DirectX 12 and Vulcan
which you can learn more about here but
I guess that's the tactic here from MSI
if the customer wants tiny gaming and is
willing to settle for single GPU they've
got that covered
but if they want no compromises they
offer that too and at a much more
palatable price premium compared to some
of the bare bones that we've checked out
recently like zou tax Magnus and 980 for
$1,600 and Emma size on vortex for that
matter so the aegis Ti is 650 bucks for
a well ventilated RGB lit case a decent
850 watt power supply as e170
motherboard and a liquid cooler actually
not bad at all
