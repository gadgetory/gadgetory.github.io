order a $35 dessert you might expect the
waiter to bring you more than just a
plain slice of raspberry pie but getting
this raspberry pie for the same price
might just end up to be a fantastic deal
a printed circuit board might not taste
as good as a piece of sweet pastry but
these little guys are a heck of a lot
more versatile but people using
raspberry pies as the basis of projects
that run the gamut from home security
and automation to robotics and even beer
making when I found out the Raspberry Pi
2 had been released I had to put it into
action myself welcome to my review of
the Raspberry Pi 2 model B
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilized the
nvme standard finding speeds never seen
before on a consumer series storage
drive click now to learn more probably
the most striking feature of the
Raspberry Pi 2 is how much stuff they
managed to cram onto a PCB the size of a
credit card you get an SOC also known as
system-on-chip that features a 900
megahertz CPU and a 250 megahertz GPU
one gigabyte of ddr2 RAM on the back of
the board and four USB 2.0 ports and a
full size HDMI port that supports audio
a 3.5 millimeter stereo jack that
actually supports video out through an
adapter if you're hooking up to an older
TV
10100 Ethernet a microSD slot for
storage and a micro USB port that powers
the whole thing you don't get a power
cord but a USB wall wart that supports
one amp of current should work fine for
most users I use the standard one amp
phone charger and had no problems
although you might want to look into
getting something like a charger rated
for two amps if you're pumping a lot of
juice through those USB ports there's
also a couple bits you won't find on
your standard desktop motherboard the PI
includes connectors for an optional mini
LCD display like you'd see on a digital
camera like we're kind of filming on now
and the optional $25.00 separately sold
Raspberry Pi camera module which allows
you to record 1080p video but probably
the most important feature for those of
you who really want to dive into a
special project is the 40 pin general
purpose input / output usually just
called GPIO these pins are fully
programmable and allow you to control
tons of different things with the PI
such as thermometers for portable
weather stations motors for miniature
tanks and RC vehicles and maybe even a
wireless door lock et cetera before I
delve into try to turn the PI into
something uber cool something on the
spec list caught my attention the CPU on
the Raspberry Pi is actually the same
CPU an arm cortex a7 that's in the
samsung galaxy s5 mini just at a lower
clock speed with how we use smartphones
for lots of basic tasks like watching
youtube videos web browsing and
listening to music I got to wondering
could the Raspberry Pi - especially if
it has double the RAM in
drupal the cpu cores of the previous
model he used as a basic pc because this
little $35 computer actually replace a
desktop that's just being used for stuff
like maybe a facebook machine I was
determined to find out so I went ahead
and inserted the microSD card that was
included and preloaded with raspbian a
distribution of Debian Linux
specifically adopted for the Raspberry
Pi keep in mind though that if you order
a pie it won't come with that micro SD
card but you can download raspbian and
load it onto your own card for free
after first displaying a configuration
utility with some basic options such as
keyboard layout the PI takes about 20
seconds to boot into the raspbian
desktop which looks a little like Mac OS
from the late 1990s a grey background
the taskbar at the top it comes with a
simple web browser console a PDF reader
a simple text editor several programming
environments and a stripped-down version
of Minecraft in case you want to forget
about your project for a few minutes and
just play with your wood and things also
a word of warning this is a Linux
environment and it's a bit of a weird
one to boot it may be a bit of a
struggle to work with even if you aren't
a Linux Wizard but I believe in you
you're a skilled and intelligent person
and with the help of online resources
you can do this once you're good to go
one of the main things people are going
to try to do is use the Raspberry Pi for
gaming outside of just minecraft and it
does quite well if you're looking for a
little micro sized retro gaming platform
there's tons of projects online for
people making super small even sometimes
mobile retro gaming machines based on
the Raspberry Pi platform and honestly
I'm not surprised as it excels in this
category first off this won't really be
that good of a PC replacement for people
who even just want to use it for Gmail
and to laugh at some memes the PI has
some issues with certain elements on
many modern websites and has a steep
learning curve for anyone who doesn't
have quite a bit of experience in Linux
so who is this product actually for well
basically anyone who has an idea for a
cool project and the patience to see it
through by learning how to configure
things in Linux can make good use of the
PI plenty of people have gotten their
retro gaming consoles
lately up and running in a matter of
hours and others have even taken it
further by building custom cases with
joysticks and miniature screens to have
a fully functional retro handheld or
gaming station but if you don't want to
gain their hundreds and hundreds of
other uses for the Raspberry Pi that are
limited basically only by your
imagination
media servers smart thermostats and even
electric electronic bottle openers have
all been powered by the Raspberry Pi so
if you have 35 bucks burning a hole in
your pocket for some reason and you're
not in the mood to spend it on dessert
it might be worth finding out just what
you can come up with
speaking of desserts our friends over at
mass drop are back with another awesome
drop the creative soundblaster III USB
DAC / amp combo which features a
built-in mic a mic in / dual headphone
out combo line in bluetooth with aptX
support and has 112 decibels
signal-to-noise ratio and it's available
over there for another four days or so
of course this product is available
through mass drop at a significantly
discounted price thanks to their group
by model essentially the more people buy
the more prices goes down for a set
minimum and it has already reached its
lowest price point which is kind of
Awesome
and it's about 40 US dollars below the
general MSRP you can check out this drop
and many others in the link in the
description or at dro PS / liest tech
tips that link doesn't give us a
kickback or anything but it does let
them know that we sent you alright guys
what would you do with one of these
little tiny machines I have a few ideas
of my own which might make it onto the
Linus tech tips channel but let me know
in the comments down below
over on the forum while you're still
here watching this video click like
dislike favorite subscribe share
anything that you really want that's
around the screen those all actually
helped us in some way or another and
don't forget to comment as well if you
want a shirt that isn't this one but is
more alanis Media Group focused you can
look in the description of the video you
can also see in the description video a
link to buy this little product that's
right here over on the forum you can see
things in the support us link like
changing your Amazon affiliate code
installing the forum add-on for your
browser which can help you see when you
get stuff like notifications or PMS or
like that and can also automatically
change your Amazon affiliate links for
you if you enable that from there along
with all of our other sponsor links now
you guys for watching I will see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
