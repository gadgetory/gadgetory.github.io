basically like the pistol and halo
combat Evolved it's small and
understated and totally overpowered now
you might be thinking okay Linus yeah
the one was pretty cool when it came out
two years ago but what is it done for me
lately how does it merit a reira view
well since you asked although these two
look very similar on the outside the
internals had actually gotten a complete
overhaul this one is rocking a
liquid-cooled core I $9.99 hundred K and
a liquid-cooled r-tx 2080 ti so let's
find out how Corsair did that after I
totally derail everything to tell you
about today's sponsor glass wire glass
wire lets you instantly see your current
and past network activity detect malware
and block badly behaving apps on your PC
or Android device use offer code Linus
to get 25% off at the link below
before we go any further I need to talk
about one area where Corsair totally
dropped the ball here see the fins here
on the original model they are slightly
above the fan grill meaning that when
you stroke them the one sings you this
wonderful little tune as for the new one
hold a ruined but seriously the build
quality and design on display here is
still fantastic every single part of it
just feels so solid and in my opinion
this machine just doesn't have a bad
side it looks great in basically any
situation from a professional studio
where desk space is at a premium to the
computer room of a well-off gamer where
the addition of RGB lighting is sure to
impress children of all ages now unless
you have a particularly keen eye the old
one and the new one which we'll be
calling the deuce from now on to avoid
confusion
look nearly identical the front i/o has
been moved down and expanded the
headphone jack here is a very welcome
addition and the side actually has a bit
of additional venting cut into it but
really that's about it for now getting
around to the back ah ok so now we're
getting somewhere
the motherboard is clearly in a
different place and it looks like the
position of the power supply has also
changed so let's dive in then and figure
out exactly what's going on here so
pressing this button on the back allows
us to remove the fan from the top that's
the one right so pressing this button on
the back so how are you doing this
so pressing this button on the back
allows us to remove the fan from the top
here you can see it's there yeah now
it's unplugged it's a hundred and forty
millimeters and takes care of the
majority of the cooling pulling air in
through the radiators that you can
actually see on either side here and
then exhausting it right up the top in
our testing this results in nearly
silent operation in many situations and
even under full load the deuce is
shockingly quiet with the two and a half
inch hard drive and the quiet water pump
competing to be an allow de store more
like least quiet component removing
these four screws then that's a marker
thought I have my screwdriver in my
pocket I don't removing these four
screws then allows our sides to slide
down so here here here and here this
gives us basically unfettered access to
the guts so with it open we can see that
there are two distinct thermal zones so
this radiator on this side provides up
to three hundred watts of cooling power
for our GPU and then this one over here
which is actually a little bit smaller
gives us about a hundred and sixty-five
watts for the CPU now this dual zone
design isn't new but courser has
actually flipped around which side the
components are on and one benefit of
that change is massively better cable
management like let's start by looking
at the GPU here I love how they were
able to get all of the cabling along the
edge over here see this it's all tucked
in there nicely rather than just
sprawling everything across the
components and as for the motherboard
huh you can see the improvement on the
motherboard side immediately because you
can see the motherboard at all and the
tubing to the radiators has also bench
which is a surprisingly important
improvement for anyone that might want
to upgrade this machine in the future in
the past when you were putting the one
back together it was really easily to
accidentally kink the tubing completely
cutting off cooling to one of the sides
not very user-friendly moving back to
the GPU we can actually see here that
the water block is only responsible for
cooling the GPUs core with v RM and
power management being taken care of by
this actively cooled heatsink this is
actually not the first time I've seen a
design like this there were some older
they were called uni sinks back when
detectors did it and you were expected
to kind of like duct-tape a fan to it
there was like no official way to do it
but it works really really well and
there are a couple of reasons for that
one it focuses all your cooling power on
the GPU itself where there's actually a
performance benefit to be gained and
theoretically if you're a true
enthusiast it's possible you'd be able
to take it and then transplant it onto a
future RTX 9000 or whatever the case may
be as long as you could figure out some
way to deal with the memory and the VRMs
now we can't say for sure how easy
that's going to be but we do know that
compared to a full cover block that is
specific to the card there's a better
chance you'd be able to reuse some of
your components well we can also say for
sure is that we got some outstanding
cooling results out of this setup here
in 3d mark the deuce was expectedly
within our margin of error for
performance compared to an air-cooled
card with the temperatures leveling off
in the high 70s after 45 minutes of
gaming so what that means is that you
might not have a massive amount of
headroom for overclocking or anything
but it also means that you can expect
full boost clocks indefinitely while
your system remains quieter than
basically any air-cooled card let alone
an air-cooled card in a tiny chassis
like this moving over to the other side
I just I feel like I have to bring this
up again how impressive the improvements
in cable routing are compared to the old
model
routine upgrades will be significantly
easier this time around there's not a
ton that you can upgrade out-of-the-box
since our config is already loaded for
bear
both RAM slots are populated for a total
of 32 gigs the single to a half inch
drive day is occupied by a 2 terabyte
hard drive and the 480 gig m2 SSD is
located on the back of the motherboard
which is probably actually easier to
access by pulling off the graphics card
but the really interesting thing over
here is the CPU radiator which is
actually smaller compared to the
outgoing model this allows the compact
600 watt power supply to pull in fresh
air from the outside rather than
recycled warm air from inside the system
so that means that it can actually
operate much more efficiently
which contributes to the overall
quietness of our machine and then back
to the size here Corsair claims that
they actually managed to increase the
cooling capacity since the new layout
has a smaller rad but one that allows
more air to be pulled through it so
let's see how that works out for them
actually looks like it's pretty well so
our core I 999 hundred K stayed right at
a blistering 4.7 gigahertz and games
even after giving it plenty of time to
heat up the coolant and our temperatures
managed to hold comfortably around the
mid 70s under a full synthetic load you
will end up sacrificing some clock speed
dropping down to about 3.8 gigahertz on
all eight cores but that's actually what
we expect from the CPU when Intel's
power draw specifications are followed
and it is an absolute beast so once
again in the spec view perf productivity
test the deuce throws up numbers that
are nearly identical to what we saw from
our open air test bench with the only
real downer for productivity being the
lack of an option for 10 Gigabit
Ethernet which if for being honest is a
must-have for professionals that are
working with large heavy files like the
8k red footage that we deal with around
here overall though
the story remains the same the course r1
is able to give you the performance of a
top-of-the-line gaming system in a
compact package while somehow managing
to remain quiet cool and sexy but of
course with great design comes great
cost and that really is the biggest
downside of the deuce which starts at
three thousand dollars for the i-140
with the better equipped I 160 that
we've got here
weighing in at an eye-watering
thirty-six hundred US dollars so let's
put it aside for a second and change the
subject a little bit this is the MS I
tried index it isn't liquid-cooled the
build quality is fine but not
exceptional
it's bigger it gets a bit louder under
load and it has half the RAM but it also
reaches a similar level of gaming
performance and costs one thousand US
dollars less and it gets worse for the
one in Corsair zone lineup you'll find
the Vengeance gaming PC that we reviewed
recently now it does step the
performance down a touch but you still
get a two-year warranty and you save it
$600 not to mention that there's better
upgrade ability and that's ignoring the
option of building your own PC which I
guess puts me in sort of an awkward
position doesn't it because the deuce
gives me like a great big nerd rection
and I think a world where everybody had
one of these would be a better world and
Corsair deserves that stacks of cash for
the engineering work not to mention the
design work that has gone on here it's
just that at this price you do need to
have some serious disposable income to
drop on your dues speaking of disposable
income you don't need a lot of it for
