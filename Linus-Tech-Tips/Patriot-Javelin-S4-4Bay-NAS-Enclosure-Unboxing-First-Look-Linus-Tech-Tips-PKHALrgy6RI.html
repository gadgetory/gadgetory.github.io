from Patriot to show you guys this is
the javelin s for media server and what
this does is pretty much everything that
I can think of in terms of a standalone
nass box and some things that I actually
didn't even think of so why don't we
start we have what's on the packaging on
the outside and then we'll go from there
so Patriot figures these are the main
talking points I have my own notes on
what I think are the main talking points
so we'll compare them later on first of
all it is an iTunes server so you can
use a single iTunes account for all
computers in your network that's handy
okay it is a Logitech Squeezebox server
so you can stream to Logitech enabled
devices that's also handy you can do
nasty nas backup so you can actually
image with another Javelin unit within
your network or outside your network so
that means you can do off-site backups
using a couple of Javelin units that's
very cool and that's actually not
something that was on my list so I'm
glad they brought it up it is time
machine compatible so this is another
Apple thing please don't don't hit the
dislike button time machine compatible
is a handy feature it has a BitTorrent
client so you can download and edit all
of your favorite torrent files remotely
okay remote media playback so you can
stream your media through a web browser
or iphone / Android mobile app that
one's really cool that one in my eyes
should be up at the top you PNP and DLNA
certified okay so you can seamlessly
connect to other home media devices and
finally you can share you can show off
your media with friends and family
anywhere so you can share files over the
entire web's
all right here we go product highlights
this is all pretty similar stuff oh no
actually there's more here
okay so data storage over the network
and Internet with mobile media center
and dashboard access photo albums
documents and more so that's that
internet sharing bit okay
you've got the DLNA digital media server
so that gives you instant access to your
music pictures videos via digital media
players on the home network such as the
patreon box office all right
a lot of tick squeeze box OneTouch
backup of an external hard drive or
digital camera via USB that's actually a
really cool feature that's something
that's a software thing maybe
that a lot of NASA's do not support with
their USB ports all right now stan has
replication we already covered that
snapshot for instant backup and
restoration backing up your home PCs is
something that is critical for any nas
to do now these software solutions are
either very elegant or very terrible in
my experience so that's something that
I'm glad that Patriot has worked into
the javelin because backing up your PC
is the only real solution running
something like a RAID one in a home
computer is not a real solution because
if you get a virus
you still get wiped out so doing nightly
backups is something that I would
definitely recommend to everybody
smart sync back up for automatic line
back up okay good good good jumbo frame
support so this is a one gigabit NAT so
you do have a fast transfer support and
it supports network print server by a
USB connected printers you can accessing
it attach an excess USB and eSATA
external hard drives as a folder share
on the javelin s4 so you can actually
expand the storage beyond the four drive
bays that are included with the javelin
s4 it has a two year warranty and here
is a little network map which I'll show
you more in a minute which has a bunch
of different ways that you can use the
javelin so flexible upgrade
configurations I mentioned it supports
four drives we say it supports a raid
zero and a stripe I mean ok please
please never set up four drives in a
raid zero in a backup device that
completely defeats the purpose don't do
it wrong rate Wan mirror this is a good
way to set it up so you can actually
take two drives or four drives and you
can set them up to mirror each other so
even if what any one drive fails you're
going to have all of your data
replicated somewhere else on a
completely data identical drive rape 10
is mirror and stripe performance and
backup I still don't really recommend it
because you're going to be limited by
Gigabit Ethernet anyway you might as
well just stick with your raid ones or
your raid fives so raid 5 is three
drives or more and it allows you to have
any one drive fail and then you can
another drive and rebuild the array as
if it was never gone so it supports the
capacity of two drives with three drives
so it's quite a bit more efficient than
RAID one where you need two drives to
support the capacity of one Drive but
you have the disadvantage of rebuild
time if a drive does go down in the
array now raid 5 is cool because with uh
spare disk is cool because you can throw
four drives in your javelin s4 if and
one of them is sitting there idling
doing nothing if any one drive fails
that idling doing nothing Drive will
automatically build itself in to be
ready to replace it and then you can at
your leisure take out the dead drive and
put in a new one
the deadliness for it does support three
terabyte drives so you can throw up to
12 terabytes of storage ok that's ok
into this tiny little box becomes very
well tacked as you guys just saw it's
got a big old thick layer of foam on all
sides of it this is up to about an inch
thick on all sides so I really wouldn't
worry about there being any damage to
your drives or your javelin in transit
that box back together notes alright in
terms of accessories we don't have too
much we've got what feels like a very
solid very heavy duty Ethernet cable
with gold plated connectors looks like a
six big cable and then we have a power
adapter looks like it has a built-in
power supply so no uh no external power
very very nice okay we've got drivers
and manuals the fan contains hazardous
moving parts don't you know put your
fingers or other objects in it you've
got a QuickStart guide which is like in
a lot of different languages and stuff
so you're covered pretty much no matter
how things go and this looks like some
kind of a key my guess is that it's to
keep other people from just walking up
to your javelin and pulling all of your
drives out of it I mean it's so small
I'm guessing they could just
grab the javelin on less and half of
Kensington lock which I can't tell yet
if it does it's actually kind of a slick
looking little unit that's another thing
that a lot of NASA's don't really have
going for them is they tend to look kind
of dumb and since it's something that
you either on or near your desk it's
done it is nice when it looks good all
right so there is the javelin itself and
you know what give me a second to get
things organized here all right so we
finally got the unit itself out all I
have to do is push there the door opens
at the front and I can see all four SATA
interfaces at the back of the unit it
comes with four of these drives ledges
which you use to put the drive on and
slide it into the unit itself this data
end up being a key so you can actually
lock this front door no problem but as I
mentioned before if I was going to steal
something from a javelin I would
probably just take the whole javelin
itself it's fairly small fairly light
although once you've loaded up with
drives it could be a little bit on the
heavy side and you don't want to move it
around to avoid any damage to the drives
you've got compatible with Windows 7
sticker as well as a deal on a certified
sticker Patriot logo and then you've got
your power button with a built-in LED at
the front and that pretty much does it
for the front you've got activity LEDs
for the hard drives as well as a network
LED here on the back we have a Gigabit
Ethernet port we have a hard reset
switch I love seeing hard reset switches
because even the best software crashes
sometimes I actually had a tablet
crashed on me a little while back and it
was very difficult to figure out how to
reset it because I had no hard reset
switch okay sorry sorry I pull my
tangent here Gigabit Ethernet port eSATA
interface two USB interfaces so that
means you can have one of them
permanently attached to a printer for
example and you can have the other one
available for USB storage whatever the
case may be and I'm sorry this one on
the back is actually the power button
and the one on the front is not a power
button so what is the one on the front I
don't know okay
figure that out later all right finally
we've got an 80 millimeter cooling fan
we have our power in here and then I
just want to take a look at the overall
construction of the unit so you can see
here we've got access via the bottom
panel to nothing that's screwed shut but
we do have four rubber feet here on the
bottom so that's going to keep the
javelin s4 from moving around when
you've put it down on the table it's
also raised a little bit so I don't know
if yeah there's a good way to see it so
you can see that it's going to get some
convection cooling coming up through the
bottom and that's where the fan is going
to take in some of its air that's at
least based on my observation and then
the rest is going to come through these
vents in the front which have a fine
mesh over them so you should be just a
matter of going like this to clean the
dust off then once in a while and then
there's also ventilation around the
outside edge where air should be able to
pass quite freely into the inside around
the outsides of the door so that's that
pretty much takes care of ventilation
and it appears that this is not
ventilation at all because you can see
that once I open it up there's actually
no access to the bottom compartment from
the top so it looks like that's purely a
power supply component RTM folks RTM
please read the manual this is the
OneTouch back up button so you'll use
that every time you want to do a
OneTouch back up which basically just
means it's triggering a software event
to run a pre-scheduled backup that you
have configured already so yeah that's
pretty much it
alright next a couple more things so
Patriot recommends using enterprise or
raid edition class hard drives for
maximum reliability when using raid 0 or
a grade 5 configuration it's a good
reason for that raid 0 as I mentioned
before like not as for speed it's not
for reliability you lose one drive out
of a four drive raid zero all the data
is gone so just don't use that at all
and then for raid 5 the array is quite
vulnerable if a drive fails during that
period where you haven't put in a new
drive and let it rebuild itself while
it's rebuilding if another drive fails
it will all be gone so it is best to use
enterprise class drives now finally
let's have a look at Patriot's network
map here where you have the javelin as
the center of the house right there and
then you have you know a UPS being
managed by it you have external hard
drives a printer you can backup the data
Lin itself to another javelin over the
Internet that's a really cool feature I
love that okay you've got portable
devices like phones that you can stream
media to you've got a network media
player like a box office hooked up to
your TV Xbox 360 you've got it connected
via wire to a wireless router or switch
which you can stream media to your
laptop or to your computers including
Windows and Macintosh computers and
finally any UPnP and DLNA devices and
even Linux computers themselves so
there's gonna be a full tech tips
episode coming on the javelin where we
show some of these features but for now
that is my unboxing thank you for
checking it out and I'll turn this
around the right way don't forget to
