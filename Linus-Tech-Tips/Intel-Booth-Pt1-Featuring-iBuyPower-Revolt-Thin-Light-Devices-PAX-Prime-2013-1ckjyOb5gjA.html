brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries so we're here at the
intel booth at pax prime 2013 remember
guys intel is one of our sponsors here
at the show so a huge thanks to them for
allowing us to be here if you swing by
you'll have a chance to welp see me I
suppose I hope that I caught you because
by the time this video's up I think
that'll be over they're giving away a
ton of crazy prizes over forty thousand
dollars worth of processors alone and
they've got a bunch of great technology
on display here in the booth so of
course everyone knows about Intel's
desktop processors but they're giving
you a chance to be hands-on with sort of
the new generation of Intel experiences
including things like super thin and
light tablets as well as convertible
ultrabooks so if you're not familiar
with what a convertible ultrabook is one
of two things one come by the booth or I
hope you swung by the booth and now you
know so then I guess we're not having
this conversation and number two is you
can look at me explaining what exactly
it is it's a device that is thin light
has great battery life functions as a
notebook or see if I can figure out how
the mechanism works on this one there we
go functions as a tablet also being
shown off here at the show speaking of
thin and light I mean this is still
technically a desktop machine in fact it
is a full-fledged desktop machine in
spite of its small stature I know that
because I'm quite short that it doesn't
necessarily look as small as it is next
to me but trust me it is this is the i
buy power revolt it is using the latest
Intel fourth-generation core i7
processor in order to pack just as much
gaming performance inside a tower this
size as you might find inside a much
larger one in fact the unique internal
layout of the revolt allows it to not
only run the latest core i7 processors
as fast as those may happen to be but
also even the very highest end graphics
card so it's available with up to a GTX
Titan meaning you can have a phenomenal
gaming experience even if you want to
run something like an nvidia surround
you know three display 3d kind of
configuration ventil
patient is handled in a very unique way
so you can actually see over here on
this side that is pretty much entirely
mesh over here above the key components
so the CPU is actually right below here
and if you come around to the back here
you're going to see that the internal
configuration of this case whoa hold on
a minute what's going on here is very
unique indeed so it uses a mini ITX
motherboard a PCI Express extension
cable and whoa the graphics card is in
line with the motherboard what
anti-hacking now how in the heck does
this work it also uses a very very tiny
power supply you're going to have to be
running extremely efficient components
in order to make sure that you're
cooling them adequately with a tiny
little fan like that while still being
able to provide enough power for all the
beefy gaming goodness that you might
want and another thing to mention is
that if you check us out on the linus
tech tips forum find the thread about
the intel packs giveaways because
there's one that intel's running on
twitter where you can win an eye by
power system and there's a second one
that we're running on the forum
exclusively to win a main gear system so
both of those go check them out they
will still be available to enter even
after the show so if you're watching
this a little bit late you can still win
something don't miss any of our show
coverage we're powered here at the show
by Western Digital Intel and steel
series so once again a huge thanks to
those guys for making this possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
