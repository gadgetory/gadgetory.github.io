intel core i7 4770k unlocked processor
if you're a speed freak added until 3500
series SSD to your Haswell system for a
truly enthusiast class experience so
this will be a little different from
most of our unboxings number one we
don't have a box I have already removed
the packaging from it so that I could
have a close look at it
number two is this is not a computer
product but it is definitely technology
related this is the 180 watt cup
inverter and it does not contrary to
what you might believe watch this it
does not take your cup and do this with
it that is actually not the kind of
inverter we're talking about but if you
found that terminology confusing don't
worry Energizer's got your back because
also on the box is this thing which has
charge that which I think we can all
agree looks like an iPad or pretty much
any other tablet depending on which side
of the Apple versus Samsung thing you
happen to sit on that thing which looks
like probably a laptop although it could
be a really old desktop they probably
don't want you to charge an old desktop
because that may explode in your that
thing which I think we can all agree is
a water fountain so pretty much what it
does is it takes the power that comes
out of your car out of the cigarette
lighter doodad right here and it turns
it into something that your other
devices can use so you get four USB
ports each of which share 2.1 amps of
total available power and you get one
standard 120 volt receptacle that you
can use to oh I don't know any number of
things you can charge a notebook you can
sit and use a notebook in the car you
can you know I don't know I've seen
people run game consoles and the backs
of their vehicles mind you that was back
when game consoles didn't consume nearly
as much power the device itself runs off
of the car or it can run directly off a
battery however it should be noted that
it will decrease the lifespan of your
battery to use it constantly and
aggressively and drain the battery of
your car very very often in order to use
this device so it's recommended for you
know when you have the engine running
with that said when you have the engine
running or really in any situation it's
not quite a pure sine wave that it's
outputting on this particular port so
you might run into a little bit of
interference with things like cheap
radios or whatever else the case may be
but most devices particularly modern
or once that are taking the power and
then converting it into something that
they can use which usually ends up being
DC anyway such as a notebook computer
are going to be fine like my kind of 99
pro cat I don't want to quote a number
but a lot of the time so let's go ahead
and see what you might actually need an
outlet and four USB ports for in a
vehicle now it's funny cuz I'm being a
little bit facetious and I'm sort of
playing on the whole how technologically
dependent are our lifestyles are these
days but the reality of it is I have
managed to create a scenario here that
is not completely unrealistic so step
one I've got see I've got four devices
plugged in and I've got a laptop plugged
in and this is plugged into the charger
here remember guys some vehicles will
discharge this port even when the car is
powered off so the advantage of that is
that you can still run devices in when
the cars powered off the disadvantage is
it'll run the devices and you might
drain your car battery and then not be
able to start it so be careful of that
watch out for that so check this out
okay so number one is I have a tablet
this tablet right here even on a 10-hour
road trip is not going to run out of
battery when I give it to the kids in
the back to watch a movie okay but how
are they gonna watch a movie
they've only got 16 gigs of storage on
that tablet right here guys this is a
Seagate go flex satellite this is the
last generation the wireless plus is the
current generation one so this is a
wireless hard drive that has up to 500
gigs or the new ones have a terabyte of
storage boom they're watching their
movies right there okay next up we've
got this right here so this is my
notebook
this notebook right here you can tell
from the power brick how much power it's
going to draw so it's 19 volts 3.42 amps
it's not really important to zoom in on
that but I do want you to check this out
on the super circuits volts watts amps
converter all you have to do is key in
any two values and that'll give you the
other value so this is a 65 watt
notebook so we're not going to be
anywhere near the 180 watt limit of this
particular device now there are more
powerful ones but this one is designed
to fit in a cup holder so it's not
exactly going to run your like you know
popcorn maker or something like that
alright but how am I going to work on my
notebook if I don't have internet boom
now I don't have to worry about the
battery dying on my cell phone even if I
have a portable Wi-Fi hotspot with
tethering enabled so I can run that as
long as I need to because that is also
charging
and then last but not least because we
are so dependent on having our devices
running all the time I have my fuel plus
see it's at 75% this is a portable
battery that I can then take with me
when I arrive at my destination to keep
topping up my devices even when I am NOT
in the vehicle so I have there justified
a usage scenario for five devices
plugged in in the car at the same time
now if you guys like excuse me I have
some work to do and don't forget to like
the video share the video subscribe to
Linus tech tips and leave a comment
under the video if you can see yourself
actually using something like this in
your own car to run all of your devices
all the time because we can't live
without them don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
