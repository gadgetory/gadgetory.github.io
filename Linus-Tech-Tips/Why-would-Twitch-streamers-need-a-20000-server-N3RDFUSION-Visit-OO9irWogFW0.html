trial and error over the last couple of
years about the better management of the
competing resources we have on hand
we've explored different video encoding
software solutions we've looked at CPU
encoding versus GPU encoding AMD versus
nvidia for GPU encoding and we even lost
almost all of our data in this video
here when wanax server lost a raid card
so we are finally ready to take our
education by fire on the road and the
first stop is going to be our buddies at
nerd fusion down in Seattle where we
will be dropping off this store inator
server so let's get going then shall we
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to Tritonal
bear for free check out the link in the
video description so we're here now this
actually isn't the first trip that's
been made on account of this project
Matt 7sz gursky from nerd fusion
actually made his way up to the frozen
north about a month ago to do a tag team
build of the final config a pair of
intel xeon e5 26 97 v3 14 core
processors so that's 28 Haswell course
total 128 gigs of DDR 4 ECC quad-channel
memory a super micro X 10 D RIT dual
socket motherboard with 10 gigabit
networking onboard and I'll explain why
that's important a little bit further on
and a hundred more this thing is heavy
a hundred terabytes worth of Seagate
enterprise storage with available
expansion base for up to a few hundred
terabytes more with their new 10
terabyte helium drives thanks to this
awesome store inator that our friends
over at 45 drives whipped up for us can
you guys actually help me with this
thanks Matt oh so this is actually a
customized version of their new store
inator so it's got an extended ATX
compartment instead of a 2x thanks for
holding that for me champ as well as
their new switch to 92 millimeter fans
in the front to make room for this LCD
panel that lets you more easily diagnose
failed drives the last big change is the
fact that the front panel can be
entirely tooless well it's ok to list
but screwdriver lists if you don't screw
that in and all the drives can be
installed and removed without any of
that fancy bar holding down you know top
plates thing it's all just like a
friction mount now we should get this
thing inside but if you guys find
yourselves asking yourselves well what
would a bunch of twitch streamers need
with some kind of like uber mega server
you're probably not the only ones so I'm
going to use this opportunity where
we're hand delivering the server to walk
through
all of the different functions that this
server is going to be performing here at
the nerd fusion headquarters thanks to
the magic of unread yes of course
unrated making another appearance in
Linus's server video surprise surprise
so first and foremost yeah is the
storage of archived twitch streams as
some of you probably know twitch only
allows even partners to store their
streams for about 60 days on the service
before it is deleted permanently so this
at a hundred terabytes will be by far
the largest storage server that they
have in the building which shouldn't be
that surprising giving the only other
one that they have is their on that
shelf and is awful and will allow them
to store about one year of archived
footage for easy access to everyone who
works here I gotta figure out how to get
out of here yep that was easy so use
case number two is really cool and far
beyond what you'd be able to do with a
typical standalone as unit like we saw
sitting in the closet they're going to
fire up a Windows VM on the on raid
server then they're going to load an
application called wowza that is going
to enable them to do a couple of
different things first of all they will
be able to save a 12 megabit full 1080p
version of everything that they stream
and because that's not really optimal
for twitch they will be able to live
transcode that incoming stream onto the
server to 4 megabit 900p which is ideal
for twitch this has a couple of effects
number one is it gives them better
quality footage to work with for vod's
or if they want to bring up a past
broadcast for whatever reason during a
live broadcast and number two is with a
little more magic within wowza it would
actually enable them to have an off
platform and off twitch higher bitrate
stream available for some of their
biggest supporters that's something that
is not happening yet but could be
possible with this setup use case number
two and this is actually really cool
involves a second vm this time linux
running a program called fog it's a
free open-source cloning utility and the
point of it is that we're actually
standing in one of their guest streaming
rooms so whether it's a remote employee
who's in town for a while or someone
coming in to do a collab stream from the
office here the point of it is to be
able to take these guests streaming PCs
and quickly and easily back them up or
restore them to a previous state so that
you know Alexes passwords or
applications or whatever else are wiped
off this computer and it's ready to rock
for the next person who needs to use it
a second Linux VM is going to be set up
as a dedicated minecraft server just for
the guys here within the office now they
already have one but it's hosted at OVH
up in Canada which is a couple of
problems number one is there's distance
which means things can go wrong with the
link between here and there number two
is that it costs money if they host it
out of here for people playing locally
then it doesn't cost any extra money
other than this server that we're giving
them anyway and number three is that
having it here on-site in a VM means
that they can just allocate more CPU and
GPU resource to it as needed because as
some of you will know minecraft servers
can be Ram and to a lesser extent CPU
hogs and let's face it if your minecraft
server isn't performing properly you
could be having a worse gaming
experience than if you were trying to
gain without Doritos these aren't
Doritos these artists Ito's they're
stale so a third VM we didn't really
have anything to illustrate this because
it'll be a year before they actually
need one of these because that server is
so huge so a third VM is going to be
responsible for taking the archived
footage off of the hot storage and
putting it into cold storage so they're
actually going to be picking up an auto
loading tape drive which will basically
about once footage reaches a certain age
or the server reaches a certain amount
of fullness
it'll take any of the oldest footage
dump it onto tape label it move it out
of the way and insert a new tape into
the tape drive oh cool
okay so the last thing they're going to
be doing is replacing their current
security system with like a 15 camera
setup this will actually be a second
Windows VM we're up to a total of five
VMs that is going to enable them to do a
couple of things so number one is
running I think they were going to use
something like ice fire similar so
they're going to be able to have all
those cameras keeping an eye on the
employees who are you know fooling
around instead of working that's the
idea right Matt yep got it yep and
second of all they've actually talked
about experimenting at least maybe to
try it once with having a full-on live
stream of everything that's going on in
the office a second use aside from the
whole video encoding thing for the CPU
power that our little server in the
closet there brings to the table so I
hope you guys enjoyed this little look
at all the things our fancy little
server is going to do and I guess sort
of indirectly what actually goes into
running a twitch streaming company
something that I bet a lot of you did
not even realize existed so let me know
in the comments below if there are any
other creators that you think would have
used for even if it's just storage a
server system like this and if you'd
like to see us try and hook them up
