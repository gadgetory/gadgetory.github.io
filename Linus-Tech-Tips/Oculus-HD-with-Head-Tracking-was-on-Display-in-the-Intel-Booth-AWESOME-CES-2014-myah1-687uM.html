brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital so we got some special
treatment and we're going to be both me
and edzel are going to be jumping into
the oculus HD prototype demo here at the
intel booth I think someone just tripped
over our tripod but we're not fazed by
that because we don't even have to be in
this world anymore we're going into a
virtual world with like spaceships and
stuff you know what I've only used I've
only used the rift before once and it
was not the HD model so it was a bit of
a different experience um actually the
last time I tried it it was on the
virtuix Omni of all things oh okay I'll
get the controls figured out a little
bit here at some point there we go it's
a little bit surreal looking down it's a
little actually creepy is looking down
and seeing the arm of some dude like
here in like the legs that could just as
easily be yours as anyone elses okay so
the whole Wow for racing or 44 flight
sim this is absolutely amazing i only
play the first person shooter last time
around but this is a whole I mean the
holy grail of racing or flight sim used
to be like surround monitors around you
and there was kind of this contrived
thing where you could you know you could
check your rear-view mirror okay it's a
little disappointing at first where you
could check your rear-view mirror by
looking behind you at a different
monitor but this is a lot more natural
it actually it weirded me out i went to
adjust my glasses without sort of
realizing that it's a whole huge thing
in front of me i gotta say you know
hearing John Carmack talk about the
future of oculus at invidious events um
a couple months ago where he was saying
that the true Holy Grail is going to be
low persistence and 4k I see what he
means but compared to the early dev kits
which were running at a much lower
resolution 1080p is oh that's that's
really weird looking down at your chest
like I
I could be touching my groin right now
except I'm not but that's my like
digital character some kind of alert
going on there's a bit of a problem
evidently by the holy crap and the whole
but the helmet thing is it's not it's
not that uncomfortable it's not perfect
yet like I can feel a little bit of a
pressure point on my nose but when you
consider sort of the type of gamer
playing which is a flight sim it doesn't
feel that unnatural tap outside I can't
I'm like oh it's like space out there
right no actually that's mark um I mean
when you've got sort of your headphones
on and your and your helmet on you
actually just feel like you're wearing a
flight helmet it's a lot more immersive
oh I died alrighty then they're
launching me again maybe we'll do what
maybe we'll do a trade off here I can
trade off with Miami my camera operator
edzel I don't looks kind of weird like I
don't know where to go I feel like if I
if I got up I should just get up out of
the chair but but then then I don't move
but then I do some people have been
talking about headaches with it almost
you know almost kind of kind of like
normal 3d and even though it's running
in 3d from 3d vision unless it's a very
little persistence display I'll usually
get a headache within about 30 seconds
and I don't have any headache whatsoever
up till now so being able to just track
people just spits perfect
I think the conclusion for the oculus HD
prototype video is actually fairly
straightforward I think we're both
buying one that's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
