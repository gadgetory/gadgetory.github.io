secret I'm on the record and more than
once as thinking that smart speakers
like the Amazon echo and Google home are
kind of cool and with the potential to
be awesome in the future but right now
not useful enough to warrant their three
digit price tags but what if 50 bucks
got you all the same functionality
introducing the Google home Mini as
smart as the original but at just thirty
eight point five percent of the cost and
speaking of smart only the smartest
sponsors like ZOTAC support our channel
there ZBOX pcs are great for
applications like streaming and gaming
and feature Intel's seventh generation
core processors in a tiny form factor
check them out at the link below
design-wise the Google home mini nails
it it's smaller than a donut weighs only
a hundred and seventy grams that's 5.99
seven ounces and comes in three distinct
colors unlike its rival the Amazon echo
dot many has no visible buttons relying
instead on a touch sensitive fabric top
to adjust the volume and craftily
stealth indicator lights for visual
feedback now originally you could tap
the middle to play in pause and to Hale
the assistant without using your voice
but that functionality has actually
since been disabled possibly forever
according to a Google statement since
some kind of bug was causing the mini to
record audio without you asking that
means physically there's really not much
to it anymore
there's a hardware switch for disabling
the minis microphones outright when you
want some definite privacy and then next
to it a port for plugging in the power
cable which is USB micro-b instead of
see what I mean given you get a free
mini with the purchase of a pixel to
phone it would be in face of the two
products at interchangeable power cables
maybe we'll get that on the next-gen on
the subject of the power cable no the ho
mini is not Wireless though for some
things that would be kind of nice even
if the battery life sucked being able to
cart it over to the shower or put it on
the workbench next to you in the garage
would be kind of killer with the
flipside being that it could easily get
lost if the battery died between a couch
cushion and you know Google's got to get
that money so they would probably much
rather you carry your phone around with
you and then fill your house up with
these things anyhow speaking of do I
need to already have a full sized Google
home for the mini to work and what's the
difference between the two anyway as
with the Amazon echo and the echo dot
the only difference is the size and the
price oh right and also the audio
quality so how bad is that speaker well
the mini single 40 millimeter driver
emits
equally in all directions and actually
my first impressions anyway is that the
speaker isn't that bad the assistants
voice in particular is full-bodied and
clear and as for music there are only a
handful of phones that I've used with
what I would call acceptable speakers
some many of them are even discomfort
inducing at normal listening volumes for
me but this is quite a bit better than
that the quality is more on par with or
even exceeding what you might expect
from a laptop and it's surprisingly loud
so you could use it instead of your
Bluetooth speaker that is to say as long
as you have a power plug nearby and the
experience gets even better when you
link a few of these bad boys along with
any other Google home or chromecast
enabled devices in a multi speaker setup
now compared to my solo set up at home
it doesn't sound as good but it's really
cost-effective and the voice controls
let you adjust the volume of the entire
group or individuals without using an
app even if you want to turn down the
mini that you aren't directly speaking
to with all that said I wouldn't go out
of my way to listen to music on these
especially just one of them but I don't
think Google wants you to do that anyway
that's what the $400 home max is for
we're hoping to review that one shortly
to evaluate its superior auditory
experience because we don't have
hands-on with it yet I can't draw a
conclusion but I will say that it would
have to be pretty impressive because
sound from the mini can actually be
piped through third-party speakers
provided that big asterisk here they are
chromecast enabled or you have a
chromecast Audio dongle for them because
unlike the echo dot but like the pixel
to the mini does not have a
three-and-a-half millimeter audio out
Jack so that you could hardline at the
old fashioned way this appears to be a
clear cost-saving issue and is one of
our biggest knocks against this product
but enough about the hardware let's talk
about the software experience along with
the
visting home features like using it as a
voice remote for your TV which is so
super cool by the way the mini is also
rolling out some new tricks broadcast is
an upcoming feature that lets you send
messages throughout the house in the
assistance voice annoying eagle is
returning to nest I repeat annoying
eagle is returning to nest so that's
pretty cool and voice match lets mini
know who it's talking to okay Google
tell me about my day good morning Alex
it will take you 45 minutes to get to
work so multiple users can link their
accounts and commands like call mom will
actually call your mom and not your
roommates mom unless that's what you
were going for which brings us to the
best new ish feature free non-emergency
calling within the US and Canada which
came out about a month ago you can call
any local business or any contact that's
in your phone and the thing that's
actually new new is that now you can
actually link your number to it so that
phone calls coming from the Google home
will look like they are coming from your
phone and it's smart so you can speak to
it naturally some stuff that seems
pretty obvious to me doesn't work yet
like returning your last missed call but
other things that we tried worked
surprisingly well
like redialing the last number that you
called or hey Google call the closest
open pizza place
calling Pizza Hut on 56 Avenue in Surrey
and this kind of functionality also
syncs with your phone like if you ask
many how to get to the aforementioned
pizza place
it'll be MIT over to your handheld
device and it works the other way too
you can browse for recipes on your phone
and then send the one that you want over
to the assistant with okay Google start
cooking like anything though it's not a
perfect product and we do have some
complaints Google home still a year
later can't send a text message sorry I
can't send text yet probably because
they don't have enough confidence in its
voice recognition to
send out messages from a device that you
can't preview them on yet and this one
is even more relevant to me it doesn't
sync with G sweet Google's enterprise
level product so since my entire life is
basically work and I use my corporate
email account for everything this
effectively means I can't use it for my
calendar at all so for you though is
this the smart speaker to get I still
need that work integration but for
everyone else men since echo still isn't
available in Canada at 50 bucks I really
don't see what you have to lose this is
a great place to start if you want to
join the smart speaker revolution and
speaking of joining the revolution if
