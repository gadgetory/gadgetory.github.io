making their own office their unique
style and fancying it up a little bit
we've got - the head of it all who has
not done a single thing with his office
since Linus is kind of an old dude with
lots of new ideas we thought we'd take
some old hardware and bring some new
ideas to life so with the help of
Corsair and free geek we've got
ourselves a bunch of old computer
hardware pieces that we're going to try
and shape into a beautiful art on his
wall so come along for the ride oh god
oh god they're not supposed to look like
this what's a terrible idea
intel skull canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the
link in the video description
Filan you can't use your office anymore
you just told me that hey wanted to
catch your office why I'm not doing an
alternate take of this you have to use
that one no I'm not saying anything
cameras rolling I don't understand I
don't film stuff can you just like to
spell it up please
okay so apparently this is why we don't
reenact things cuz it doesn't work
that's a lie we do that all the time
well why just told me to say that so
there you go anyway the reason he can't
use his office is because we're actually
having it painted so she's helping us
out
I'm sorry Kailen Kailen right thank you
she's painting it orange so these tools
are going to be orange to match that one
and we're just gonna have the one white
wall here that we're going to use for
the motherboards and hopefully when Jake
gets in today we'll get started so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to mask the
window and the door so that my just
can't see in to see what we're doing
anymore
it is really orange color was it before
is it what yeah don't touch it okay so
what are we doing where all the
motherboards going here
this whole wall oh and then where is the
logo going are we still doing that I
think up there we're going with above
the windows and we're making that out of
RAM yeah white and black well okay and
then what other stuff there's like so
much stuff oh it's just more
motherboards I thought this was just
other stuff no but it's just more
motherboards there's lots of projects if
you have lots of CDs there's like an
aquarium we're having trim people what
shrimp in the aquarium yeah like real
shrimp
yeah real strict alright
what happened here well you'll be
pleased to know the tank passed the leak
test unfortunately water soil everywhere
because that thing can hold way more
than I thought it could so cleaning up
the kitchen so here's what we have we
have these fabulously fancy little
miniature shrimp with some with some I
guess that's moss or something got those
we've got some moss balls for them to
play in some some fuzzy green balls on
though I'll let you guys liked those
this one looks like Olmec from the old
Nickelodeon show so we've got that
shrimp food nutria fin cycle biological
aquarium supplement hey so just so you
guys know I wasn't hired to be an
on-camera personality just keep that in
mind when leaving comments Thanks
accidentally filled the pitcher with hot
water but fortunately I caught myself
since we don't want to have a Louisiana
shrimp boil we actually want these guys
to live so cool water oh my gosh oh my
god okay
oh we got the pump turned on then we've
got some pretty sick bubbling action
it's like a Jacuzzi for these shrimps
we'll be fantastic so there you have it
see okay
maybe don't give them a seat here first
oh god that's not whining that's the
optimum life oh my god why is this okay
hold on wait moment the truth you not
want to spill the shrimp okay there's
two there yeah there's an outer bag
there's an inner bag oh god oh god
they're not coming out
Oh God wait go in I really don't want to
suffocate them so like I'm just kind of
putting a bag inside
that's probably much better than having
to be out of the water for too long just
trying to get because yeah there we go
yeah they were caught in the algae thank
you
you still have one in there I don't
think so bro we'll check right now okay
so our shrimp aquarium is basically
complete um the shrimp they're all kind
of clustered in one corner they're kind
of trolling around the bottom because I
guess that's what shrimp do um they got
some food sticks down there so they
should be fine for a while uh so yeah
that pretty much does it we've got a
whole bunch of CDs we're gluing them
together the shiny side up for a badass
CD lamp so we're calling it is we're
going to call it it's gonna be sweet
when it's done so I'm working on a DIY
LED lamp for Linus's office drill the
hole so that we can run this awesome LED
through it so I just have to do this
through here and then we're going to run
it all the way along the ready rod to
the very top and then once we're done
that Ivana has already pre glued CDs for
me so one side you can't see the bottom
of discs and the both sides of shining
so this is the completed DIY lamp but we
ran into a big a bit of a snag where the
LEDs didn't actually fit yeah we should
have to jumble all of these to make sure
that there's actually space for the LED
to fit through I think as a like kind of
cool like art thing this will make the
office look pretty awesome so even
though it's not the brightest thing in
darkness if Linus ever has his lights
completely off which I'm sure he will at
some point it's actually not that bad so
we didn't think the i/o on the
motherboards look too great for the wall
so we're going to take it up alright so
you might be wondering what we're doing
with all these cases here with the front
cut off of them what we're actually
making is shelving out of an old case so
we've got these cases from Corsair we're
cutting out this whole section here and
then we're going to have some wood going
in so that we can anchor some gosh-darn
drawers
right into it so yeah we're going to cut
this part off otherwise the doors aren't
going to fit I did a bad job of that
that they slide in they slide out
wonderful so now what we got to do put
this on the front so it still looks like
PC but we got some stuff in the way of
these drawers so I think I think I have
to get rid of all these tabs now that
those are out of the way
there we go look at that
and then I'll slide in and out with the
drawers so I'll put glue on it and
that's in I'm cold full colt and today
we're going to be taking three of these
frames and we're going to be gluing
quite a few of these key caps on to the
border here and then Ed zl-- is going to
get us a beautiful picture to put inside
this leg he's even straight not exactly
but like it's it's fine hi I have you
tonight cables and I'm gonna do a thing
so then you have a girl like us
Nikki oh I don't put my name there
little signature and then I think I put
Linus sucks somewhere but I don't know
where that one is
so I zip tied a bunch of floppy disks
together we're actually going to make
fun well a welcome and I do not disturb
sign for Linus so this side is going to
say do not disturb and that side we're
gonna write welcome we're going to hang
it on his doorway there so he can flip
to whatever side he wants
and final update on the motherboard wall
it is now completely done
it looks frickin awesome I really like
how the paint job and layout turned out
and we were just putting the very last
piece in right as we speak and it's just
a little gap filling right there well
that doesn't really fit that look thin
enough a lot darker in here now
don't worry it's just a little bit of
blue on the carpet just just a little
just a little bit I'm sure I can get
that off I am apparently cutting these
to make a tea mess clock what's the mass
clock it is a clock for your mouth so
that you know when to click things what
is each Mouse thingy going to be like 1
2 3
how do you know which Mouse is the for a
position okay so they're not marked no
they're not going to be my size have to
guess based on where means when you're
blaming okay is that what it's supposed
to look like this looks terrible whose
idea was this okay so I just tested one
of these mice and they work we're just
wrecking working mice so as Technica is
your thing what do you think of the
Technic you post I really like how you
put in the brain fissures you know brain
fissures increase the brain surface area
that allows our brains to like learn
more stuff and say like a lizard or
something your brain must be really
wrinkly thank you Ezell that's the best
compliment a was given to me all year
and I'm Anna and sadly I'm completely
serious
you made this one's my favorite they
told me what to do with it so I just put
me in there I think it turned out great
Comic Sans you can't go wrong when you
use common sense
look straight enough maybe I don't think
space is right but fix that
yeah spacing is all that's fine I can
fix that let's just make sure it's
straight cool looking up something yeah
me too me I'm putting his secret words
in this I'll disclose them later cable
mod your wide beams are killing me here
dude maybe turn it off okay I'm sorry
it's like Christmas look at that that
looks terrible not gonna lie like
recording me doing this probably
Superboy
well yeah but it's all it's gonna get
cut down I just want to make sure that
there's a good to this going supply
Nestico
