quick unboxing of the enttec cooler h2o
620 so this is the little brother to the
cooler h2o 920 now the key difference
between this one and the 920 they're
both fairly similar in terms of the
design is the thickness of the radiator
so while the 620 uses a thinner style
radiator that offers the advantage of
better compatibility with cases on the
market the 920 is going to offer better
performance due to the larger surface
area so you can see on the front of the
box here we have a picture of the
product itself so here's the radiator
and fan as well as the flexible tubing
this is a huge feature that the cooler
series has over other pre-done liquid
cooling systems on the market because it
gives you a lot more flexibility in
terms of how you can route your tubing
there's the integrated CPU pump and
water block and let's see what they have
to say for themselves on the box so
quick install zero maintenance that I'll
believe here we've got quick install
zero maintenance okay same thing on the
back we've got low profile pump ensures
exceptional liquid circulation while
preserving internal airflow this is true
it does give you more clearance around
the CPU socket area for the mosfet
coolers to receive airflow okay we've
got intelligent noise at speed control
fan for quiet and efficient cooling so
that's a PWM fan included we've also got
non corrugated easy Bend tubing which I
talked about before in latest generation
copper cold plate and by cold plate
they're saying the same thing as what I
mean when I say water block so water
block is more of a DIY term I guess
and see if there's anything I'm missing
here on the box yeah here we go so
they're saying that the cooler h2o 620
has slightly better performance and the
first generation of pre-done liquid
cooling systems on the market and
obviously just smokes the stock Intel
cooler all right so let's see what we've
got inside the box here first thing we
find is the mounting hardware and what
antix done created wait here see this is
they have color-coded the mounting
hardware so that if you're using AMD all
you do is put in the green the green
tats into your mounting system if you're
using Intel you put the blue tabs in and
that way you can't accidentally mix them
up because with some of the other
products that were based on a similar
design the OEM is ASA TAC which is quite
obvious it's as a Sutekh right on the
radiator they were all black and it
could have been quite confusing alright
it comes with an installation guide you
can see here it shows you all the stuff
that's included with the 620 shows you
how to mount the radiator and fan to
your case as well as the CPU block /
pump unit to your motherboard next we
have the fan it's a very beefy fan
doesn't have much flex to it well-built
overall it's got a 7 blade design ok
there's little markings on it to show
you which way the air moves oh it's not
PWM this one is not PWM this is a three
pin fan connector okay and then finally
we have the cooler 620 itself so I'm
going to take off a little plastic
baggie that covers the CPU block we're
gonna have a look at that first so here
we are you can see it has pre applied
thermal compound this is an extremely
high quality thermal compound there will
be no need to replace that unless for
whatever reason you've installed it once
and then you discover that you need to
take it off well then you'll have to
clean off your CPU clean off the bottom
of the cooler 6:20 reapply thermal
compound and put it back on okay you can
see right here we've got rotary fittings
so that allows you the flexibility to
have the fittings are the tubing
approach the block from any
angle without risking kinking it it's
gonna zoom in a little bit here so so
far forward there we go so now you can
see that a little bit better there you
go
okay we've got two cables coming out of
the pump one of them is for power to the
pump right there so it's a three pin
standard three-pin power and then the
other one is for power to the fence so
this is actually an output this allows
the cooler software to to intelligently
control the pump and the fan according
to a liquid temperatures I believe at
least the 920 does anyway hold on a
second Oh bummer okay it looks like I
was wrong the 620 doesn't include the
software so I would definitely recommend
ponying up a little bit more for the 920
but the advantages that the 620 still
has are the extremely flexible tubing so
I want you guys to check this out no
matter what you do to this stuff pretty
much I want you to look at that hole not
that I've tied in the tubing no kinking
whatsoever that ensures that you're
going to get good flow of the liquid no
matter how you have to route this to get
to your CPU okay so this is just
straight power for the pump and fan and
then an extension to the fan so that you
have power it to both of those things
alright so ntek logo on the top okay
finally we have the radiator so as I
said before the radiator actually has
the ASA tech branding right on it so
it's not like it's not like it's any
secret who makes this thing there you go
hopefully you can read that now it is a
thin profile radiator so not the thicker
style that is used in the 920 so
performance is going to be about on par
with a pretty good aftermarket air
cooler so why would you go with
something like this and the answer is
fairly simple for me the reason I would
choose one of these pre-done liquid even
for my own personal system I have a
custom liquid cooling setup but if I was
going to build a more basic system I
would go with one of these over a
high-end air cooler in certain scenarios
if I'm going to be moving the system
around and if I'm worried about having
all of that weight from a cooler hanging
the CPU socket then I would definitely
consider one of these because you're
taking the heaviest part this is the
radiator full of liquid and you are
bolting it to your case instead of to
your motherboard all your bolting to
your motherboard is a little pump unit
so there's not a terrible terrific
amount of weight on the motherboard
itself whereas with a lot of tower air
coolers you're putting a huge amount of
weight on the motherboard and that is a
bit of a stressor on it so that is
pretty much it for the cooler 620 thank
you for checking out my unboxing don't
forget to subscribe to this thing really
not gonna work for me there we go Linus
