big disk this is a thunderbolt external
storage device from obviously Lizzy and
it has two Thunderbolt ports which means
it is compatible with daisy chaining
this particular configuration uses SSDs
240 gigs worth of intel ssds to achieve
just beastly read and write speeds so
let's have a look at what let's see us
to say for themselves speeds up to 10
gigabit per second mac OS raid 0 or 1 so
you can configure whatever's in there
however you want dual ports dual cooling
stand and passive aluminum heatsink you
thing going on here and uses intel
solid-state drives well suis got here so
protocols pci express datavideo dual
mode display port remember guys
thunderbolt can pass through a
DisplayPort signal so you can plug into
this and then plug out of this into a
DisplayPort monitor here it says a fair
bit ok 10 gigabit per second time
gigabit per second time gigabyte per
second and 10 gigabit per second if you
didn't gather it already it is capable
of up to 10 gigabit per second you can
daisy-chain up to six Thunderbolt
technology compatible devices
pre-configured in a raid 0 stripe for
ultimate performance so if you were
using this as a scratch disk or
something where you need extreme
performance and an external drive say
you have a laptop that used for video
editing or photo editing for example
this is the solution to your problem
power mode cables technology active
copper kick active copper cables are
purchased separately remember guys
thunderball requires active cables which
means there are actual processors inside
each end of the cable in order to pass
through the signal alright performance
comparison this is all theoretical of
course but Thunderbolt technology
basically just rips apart everything
else because it is dramatically faster
ok can daisy-chain a bunch of devices in
a row and then finally output to a
monitor with DisplayPort so Thunderbolt
Thunderbolt Thunderbolt display port and
the dual cooling with heatsink and fan
is going to be fairly evident once we
open it up so this isn't the first time
this particular product has been open
because this is a demo unit that we're
taking a look at for an upcoming NCIX
tech tips about Thunderbolt while this
thing's
heavy it's actually pretty nice looking
got a little like blue eye thing going
on in the front one eye and then we've
got a cooling fan in the back to
Thunderbolt ports a Kensington lock as
well as power you can see the the ribbed
texture here on the heatsink that
definitely makes it cooler to use of
nothing else okay so in terms of
accessories we've got a variety of
different international plugs that it
comes with so this is clearly an
international version we've also got Wow
check this out this is also made of a
resume ibly aluminium with some kind of
metal for sure and it slides in from the
back sure doesn't knots like me to go
okay well we'll figure it out give me a
sec here guys so it comes to screw so
you just take out the included ones put
this on here plug in the included screws
with the included allen key and then
it'll sit on this handy little stand
that looks very nice very
professional-looking what else we got
here okay active Thunderbolt cable not
included but ours has one just because
we need one for the demo we're going to
be doing so yeah that does that doesn't
come with it that's not part of the
unboxing ignore that part all right
power adapter and finally oh ok that
will need so that goes there that one
actually does slide in there presumably
in order to you know do something good
oh ho I see you don't actually have to
take out those other ones you just screw
that into there and then the whole
thing's is slide into Bulow table
because I guess it was probably a lot
more expensive to make out of a solid
piece of metal something with a flare on
the end I can see that okay alright I
guess that's a pretty good solution then
because yeah I can shake this to get
something out of it because it doesn't
have mechanical drives inside so I'm
kind of tempted to open this up just
because otherwise you know we're not
going to see how sexy it is inside so
give me a second here guys so we're on
during the last screw here and let's
take these out oh wow these are pretty
long it's almost like they're
compensating for something there we go
one two three
this okay let's be careful with this and
for so hope the front comes off okay you
can see the intel ssds loaded in there
so let's oh ok more screws I got undo
these ones too I guess so those are
attached right there and one and two and
okay ah there we go and there we go
alright so this is the inside of the
little big disk so there's your two
Thunderbolt ports there's your cooling
fan that's installed there's your 120
gig Intel 320 series SSD so these are
modern intel ssds there's your front LED
as well as your front switch which oh no
that's not a front switch that must be
like uh some kind of a hard reset or
something like that so we're not going
to touch that um yeah I think that's
pretty much it not much else to say so
this drive is attached here I mean if
you wanted to change the drive you could
which is kind of cool very simple looks
like there's some kind of beefy like
chips that you thing going on under
there but we're not going to take it
apart any more than that thank you for
checking out our unboxing and complete
disassembly of the the sea little big
disk and don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips for more boxing's
reviews and other computer videos and
the reason we have such high end SSDs in
here so that we can properly showcase
the performance of which Thunderbolt is
capable sorry guys we have to clarify
something to turn the device on you do
have to press on this right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
