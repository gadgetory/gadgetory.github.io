about the fractal design core 3500
starts with the package if you know what
I mean
the Corsair Flash Voyager go is the easy
way to move photos music and videos
between your Android device and your PC
click now to learn more of course I
meant the Box fractal uses a hard foam
here that isn't my favorite closed cell
foam would be that but considering the
price point of the case and the expected
weight of a completed system it should
keep your goods well-protected in
transit if you know what I mean innuendo
aside though once we get the case out of
the box we're greeted by the traditional
clean-lined fractal design aesthetic the
front features a brushed plastic finish
to five and a quarter inch drive bays a
small logo that seems to be designed to
be easily replaced with something else
are we targeting system builders here
fractal and long filtered mesh strips
that will feed the included front 140
millimeter fan and the optional second
mount underneath it with fresh air the
mesh looks good but it's the first of a
number of things I noticed about the
case that just aren't up to the usual
fractal design standard much like on my
wife's older our committee the dust
filter system for those front intakes
can't be easily removed for cleaning and
because the mesh is so fine
you can expect some wicked dust to
visibly build up there I'm also not a
huge fan of the top of the case as a cat
owner top IO is already not my favorite
thing in the world but having the power
and reset button so close together and
so easily accidentally pressed feels
like a move from the 2010 case
manufacturing playbook rather than the
2014 one and the fan mounts up here
which support dual 140 or 120 millimeter
fans and up to a dual 120 millimeter
radiator just didn't seem robust enough
to handle the weight of our closed
looped water cooling system the way it
flexes might have been fine on a $70
case where I'd be thankful to have rad
mounts at all but this one has an MSRP
of $90 the outside isn't all bad though
the right side panel is solid and black
just the way I like them while the left
one has
large slightly tinted window that I
found quite tasteful on the bottom we
find plastic feet and what is now a more
traditional pull it out of the back when
you need to clean it fan filter then on
the back we've got a noise isolated
power supply mount seven expansion slots
a second included 140 millimeter fan and
a fan control switch whose location is
going to put the core 3500 back on board
the pain train let's open her up shall
we
this this fan controller I don't say
this kind of thing often so when I do I
hope manufacturers pay attention fractal
I love you guys but what were you
thinking these are some examples of the
100 more sensible places you could have
put this it's got a green PCB that's
visible from the window the molex
connector sits either next to your power
supply or it runs across your PCI slots
and the fan leads aside from being
impossible to cable manage nah
have some of the worst sleeving i've
ever seen on a fractal product it's this
inflexible heat shrink stuff that
doesn't even go to the end of the
colored wires the only good thing about
the included fan controller is that we
use them a sous motherboard in this
build which has on-board fan control and
the wire harnesses come off so we only
have to look at the unsightly PCB
instead of the entire thing actually you
can take the PCB out too it just leaves
a little hole in the case so that's
another good thing about it and there's
some other bad stuff in here too but
five and a quarter inch bays don't
inspire much confidence and the
clearance for both the top mounted and
front mounted radiators could be better
with the top rat installed it is
impossible to access the top portion of
our board we could barely even get it in
with the eight pin power connector
pre-installed and for the front mounted
red you need to ship the hard drive cage
in word for it to fit which will
interfere with a second high-end
graphics card and this could be a
problem if your whole reason for
installing another radiator in the front
is that you want your SLI or crossfire
setup to be adequately cooled but like
the outside the inside isn't all bad the
solidity of the three and a half inch in
two and a half inch drive cage is among
the best I've ever seen
at least when it screwed into the front
of the chassis the included rubber
grommets ample space behind the
motherboard tray and metal loops for zip
ties make cable management pretty easy
funny note here actually fractal
includes exactly as many plastic zip
ties in the box as the case has metal
loops I definitely lawl about that but
then I stopped laughing as I was working
on cable management at the back and
realized that the dual two and a half
inch SSD mounts on the back of the
motherboard tray are the older-style
screwing from the front oh wait I
already have a motherboard installed I
guess I'll use velcro motherboard SSD
mounts these just plain aren't very good
the bottom one can't be accessed if you
have a power supply installed even
though the cases manual tells you to put
the power supply in first and even if
you did have the foresight to install
your SSD first the connectors are so
flat to the back of the motherboard tray
that you'd be putting quite a bit of
strain on them if you tried to plug them
in and they weren't completely flat ones
many power connectors are like this this
was a disappointment especially when
fractal design has cases with much
better implementations the good news I
guess is that there's a two and a half
mount in the second optical drive bay
that's unlikely to be used so folks with
only one SSD won't have to use up a
three and a half millimeter mount and
they won't have to use the back of the
motherboard tray so with all that said I
guess its conclusion time I've spent a
lot of this video on nitpicky stuff I
don't like like the motherboard
standoffs not being pre-installed rather
than looking at the bigger picture and I
feel like I should take a step back for
a moment it's not like the core 3500 is
a terrible case if you like the
aesthetic you could find much worse
options out there at this price but I
guess these little issues were so hard
for me to accept because fractal isn't
new to the case manufacturing game
anymore they should be experienced
enough to realize that if your PCI thumb
screws are installed with power tools at
the factory then putting a fan
controller in the way of getting a
screwdriver in there is going to mean
that every builder will need to remove
that fan controller to install their
graphics card for the first time and
that's my problem here
I expected fractal to blow me away with
their design and innovation again and
that just wasn't the case
speaking of cases HuluPlus has cracked
the case so to speak on delivering top
notch content streaming services you've
probably tried classic Hulu on your
computer but Hulu Plus is much more it
works on pretty much any streaming
device like your Roku chromecast or
smart phone which means you can watch at
home or on the go with these they have
currencies and episodes of shows like
Modern Family and Parks and Recreation
as well as entire back libraries of some
of my personal favorites like South Park
and Doctor Who so whether you're trying
to stay up-to-date with current shows or
catch up on an entire series Hulu Plus
has you covered oh and you'll also get
access to originals that you can't get
anywhere else
like the upcoming hotwives of orlando a
parody of The Real Housewives which will
be available July 15th sounds pretty
good
Florida hotwives do you know that
Florida is actually one of the fattest
states I hope that's not the kinds of
anyway I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure that
it won't be those kinds of hotwives like
like they're too warm and they need to
anyway
the point is it's only $7.99 a month but
right now they're offering you guys a
chance to try Hulu Plus completely free
for two weeks when you sign up be sure
to use the link in the video description
Hulu Plus dot-com / - so you get that
extra week because they always offer a
free week so you don't actually have to
give me any credit for sending you over
there but I'd really appreciate it if
you do in the extra free week is like
also great - so that's pretty much it
guys thank you very much for watching
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment
and let me know was I too hard on the
core 3,500 did I beat it up too much
does it look like a great case to you I
mean I hit myself on the fan I mean that
the build quality is good I mean there's
all you know the metals fold it over
like it's it's not a bad case so let me
know do you think I do think I judge you
too harshly and that's pretty much it
guys the link in the video description
to support us is down there so you can
go ahead and you can give us a monthly
contribution you can buy cool t-shirt
