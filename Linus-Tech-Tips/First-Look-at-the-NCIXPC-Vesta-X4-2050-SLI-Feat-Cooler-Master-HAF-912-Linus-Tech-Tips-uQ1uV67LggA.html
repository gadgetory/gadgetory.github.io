PC system this is the vesta 2050 so last
time we were looking at the 3050 and
this one has some key changes first of
all you can see the case is quite a bit
different this is a value gaming case
from Coolermaster this is the brand new
half 9/10 so you can actually I wanted
to treat this video kind of as a look at
the 9/10 as well as as a look at this
particular gaming system it looks like
oh shoot it looks like I managed to
unplug the DVI cable there well there we
go
it's back it's working awesome so you
can see we're running a mafia 2
benchmark here you don't actually have
to look at that camera man but I'm gonna
go ahead and pick this off so we've got
half okay half stands for high air flow
so you can see the side panel here runs
with either a 120 or 140 millimeter fan
on it you've got all the amenities
inside so you can run with let me see -
120 s - 140 s I believe or you can run
with that looks like a 160 so you've got
tons of 200 sorry 200 so you've got a
ton of options in the top for air flow
you've got a 120 millimeter fan in the
back you've got to 120 s by the look of
things in the front or those might be
ninety two's let me see
hopefully cameraman - 120 s - 120 s in
the front all right so let's have a look
at the system's back here so actually no
let's continue to look at this case
because there's a lot of cool stuff in
here first you got support for - SSD
drives natively that's two two and a
half inch drives and then you've got
support for an additional one two three
four five six three and a half inch
drive so you have a ton of storage
options you can also install and how
many optimal things yeah we've got four
or five and a quarter inch base you can
see here on the front we thought only
the one drive installed right now you
got all your usual front connectivity
reset power all those lights and you've
got the traditional half styling now
it's really sort of standout ish about
this case is how solidly built it is for
a value case and I mean Coolermaster has
really done a great job with their half
series overall everything from this is
now the lowest end all the way up to the
half
so let's talk a little bit about this
back of this machine you can see we've
got a different architecture here so
we're using instead of an Intel CPU
we're using an AMD CPU this is an Athlon
2 x4 so we do still have a quad core
even though this is a lower price system
at 7:49
we're using an MSI motherboard once
again this is an enforce board because
we did 1 SLI support and it also
features the new GTS 450 so once again
is with the cyclone cooler so we're able
to maintain that level of quiet
and speaking of quiet we've gone with a
c sonic power supply this time around
with an 80 plus bronze rating this power
supply is actually capable of powering 2
cards in sli with this configuration
more than capable and it runs dead
silent because it's 80 plus bronze and
it uses a quiet 120mm fan we've got a
500 gig drive in here for storage and
obviously you can upgrade it to an SSD
or a bigger drive if you want and the
cameraman today is not a secret it is
actually our NCIX Ivan the guy who runs
our NCIX PC Facebook and actually does a
lot of work on our pcs these days and he
wanted me to talk a little bit about
mafia 2 so we have the benchmark running
but there's a couple things that we
wanted to touch on first of all tweaking
so at the default settings we were able
to get 29.8 FPS so that's with physics
on medium running on the video part but
there's actually a few things you can do
and you can get details on this on the
NCIX PC Facebook page you can actually
tweak it so that you can turn off
certain aspects of the PhysX such as
clothing so if you don't turn off
clothing but if you turn off the PhysX
on the clothing the dynamic clothing on
all characters you can actually boost
that up considerably to about 37 fps and
if you're running 37 fps in the demo
you're actually getting a reasonably
good gameplay experience however
sometimes it's kind of fun to see the
the clothing whooshing around and
explosions and stuff like that so if you
only leave the clothing on for Vito and
I mean the dynamic clothing then you get
around 33 point 3 FPS which is again
acceptable but you don't have dynamic
clothing on all the people around you so
that's something that we wanted
talk about a little bit bear in mind
this is the OC version that comes with
this system and there's also another
note here yes it comes with Jeff Koz too
so just in case you were curious we have
a couple vantage benches here so with
physics turned off it scores about 9,000
3d marks which is pretty darn good for a
system in this price range and then if
you turn PhysX on just in case you have
an Nvidia card and that's your point of
reference you can see the CPU score CPU
jumps way up and you get a substantially
higher score although this is the one
that any Radeon users or older geforce
users are going to want to compare
against so thanks for checking out our
little showcase on the half nine one two
as well as the vesta 2050 and don't
