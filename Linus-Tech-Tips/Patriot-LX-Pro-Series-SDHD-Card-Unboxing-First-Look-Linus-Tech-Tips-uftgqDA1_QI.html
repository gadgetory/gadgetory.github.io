may or may not be exciting to you this
is the Patriot LX pro series of SD cards
it is suitable for capturing in 1080p it
is optimized for dslrs and HD camcorders
and it can write it up to 20 megabytes
per second this is a class 10 card that
means you got the high right speed and
it is still sdhc although anything above
32 gigs becomes SDXC on the back you
find not a whole lot of information Oh
class 10 means 10 megabytes per second
minimum sustained right so it's
exceeding that specification by pretty
much double so I got a couple of these
for my new xa10 cam well not mine but
for the new tech tips xa10 camcorder
that we're going to be using so i'm
going to show you guys not only an
unboxing here who looks shiny pro series
the LX series in general is very very
popular than I XO the pro is just an
evolution of that so I'll show you guys
my duel unboxing here ok so i
requisitioned these for our internal use
and i can get the box open well are
ready to using them for something ok so
here we go so it has 64 gigs of built-in
memory but since we record in the
highest quality settings camera matin
and i do we will be needing additional
storage capacity so i'm going to go
ahead and turn this over here and we
will be installing these SD cards which
can either be written 20 concurrently
like like raid one kind of thing oh hold
on pushed reject yeah
okay there we go that's a little sticky
interesting okay well you can either
write to them at the same time the same
data kind of like raid one or you can
write to one and then the other once
this is full you can pop that out slide
in another one while you're recording
here and then finish that one start
recording here popping a new one so you
can record continuously without any
interruptions so thank you for checking
