chapter of X FX's new pro series power
supplies so these are all super
efficient really like super efficient
high-performance power supplies that are
also focused on silence clean power and
ease of use so what makes them easy to
use is the fact that they have easy rail
which is basically XFX is way of saying
that they have a single powerful 12 volt
rail they've got a five year warranty so
this is the 10 50 watt 80 plus gold
version we've already seen the limited
edition 1000 watt 80 plus platinum and
that's okay here we go and then we've
also seen the 1250 watt 80 plus gold as
well so the key difference between the
10 50 watt 80 plus gold and the 1250
watt 80 plus gold is going to be in the
GPU support so the 10 50 watt unit is
only rated for 1050 watts which you know
what some would argue you could probably
get away with a four-way graphics card
configuration but it wouldn't really be
my recommendation um I said during the
1250 watt one that you could get away
with it with 1250 and I stand by that
especially now that AMD has released
their new 7970 graphics cards which we
found out actually don't consume much
more power in fact if any than the 69 70
which is a really good sign what that
means is maybe we're kind of getting to
the end of this more power with every
generation of graphics card thing so you
can buy a power supply now that's good
for three to four high-end GPUs
depending which capacity you buy and be
confident that it's going to work with
the next generation product so this one
right here is 80 plus gold is 10 50 watt
and it is it comes equipped with three
pci express modular cables each of which
has 26 plus two pin connectors at the
end so it's ready for 3 graphics cards
by default also
with black screws for installing it in
your case as well as a super beefy thick
power cord now this is one of the killer
features of this guy right here the I
would never even consider turning it off
this is hybrid fan mode and what hybrid
fan mode does is when your power supply
is under hold on let me just double
check yes when your power supply is
under twenty percent load which let's
face it a 1050 watt power supply is
usually going to be under twenty percent
load especially when you're idling when
it's under twenty percent load the fam
turns off completely this is not a flaw
this is not a defect this is by design
so what that means is you're not
accumulating dust in your grill and in
your fan and in your power supply
because it's not even spinning whenever
your system is not actually actively
doing something which is outstanding I
think that's the coolest thing in the
world and every power supply from now on
until the end of time should come with
this feature you can't really enable a
feature like this unless you build a
very efficient power supply though
because add a thousand watts even 80
plus let's say eighty percent efficiency
is kicking out a lot of excess waste
energy so you have to get that I mean 80
plus gold is up in the neighborhood of
87 to eighty eight percent efficiency so
that is what enables them to achieve
that so in terms of modular interface
back here we've got motherboard we've
got one of these eight pin guys for the
CPU we've got those three PCIe
connectors so those are for these ones
so that's up to six that's up to six
plugs off of these three then we've also
got one two three four five six
peripheral connectors and I'll show you
all the cables we have four options for
those and then over here we have either
an additional CPU connector and this
power supply actually comes with both
8-pin CPU cables or you can plug PCIe
and so the 1250 watt comes with that
additional PCIe this one doesn't but I
don't think it's relevant because you're
not going to be powering for graphics
cards off this guy in terms of the of
the aesthetic I think XFX has done a
fantastic job of making their power
supplies stand apart from everyone
else's so you got your XFX shiny logo
there stand apart from everyone else's
without looking tacky because you see a
lot of power supplies
stand out but they just look awful and
XFX has not gone down that path at all
well actually before we before we wrap
up here one of the things that makes
this power supply kind of unique is if
you look inside you don't see that huge
thick thing of wires running up to the
modular interface and that's because
they're using a solid link interface so
what the solid link interface does is it
takes solid pieces of metal and they're
just routed like this off the PCB up to
the modular interface rather than
running wires it's more efficient that
way and it's tidier internally which is
not only better for efficiency but also
better for cooling let me just see if
there's anything I'm missing here we
covered easy rail we covered solid link
and we covered hybrid fan control so all
those major ones are there and then what
have we got over here yes okay yes true
wattage guarantee it is 1050 watts of
continuous power lesser power supply
brands are known to leave out things
like some of the automatic protection
sensors which are all in this guy and to
not actually deliver continuous power at
a realistic operating temperature which
XFX is rating at 50 degrees which I
would say is even a little bit
aggressive most power supplies are not
going to be 50 degrees internally under
really any circumstances we're talking
50 degree internal temperatures in your
case which doesn't happen very often so
there that's the example of the solid
link vs the the big thing of wires that
goes out to that soldered modular
interface that looks really messy and
unrealistic but trust me most of them
look like that solid link ok so I think
we've pretty much covered everything
there so let's have a look at what we've
bought in terms of peripheral connectors
and then I think we're pretty much
wrapping it up we've got our 24 pin here
and then in terms of options here so for
sada we've got a 3 theta another 3 theta
another 3 theta and a tues data so that
when I'd probably run up to my optical
drive and then the others I'd use for
hard drives or SSDs we've got one of
those molex to do a floppy adapter in
case you still use any floppy connectors
in your system we've got a 2 mol x + 2 x
3 molex is so you can choose whatever so
you can plug in whatever you want
because it is fully modular so thank you

1000 50 watt power supply
