chapter of X F X's new pro series power
supplies so these are all super
efficient really like super efficient
high performance power supplies that are
also focused on silence clean power and
ease of use so what makes them easy to
use is the fact that they have easy rail
which is basically XFX is way of saying
that they have a single powerful 12 volt
rail they've got a five-year warranty so
this is the 10 50 watt 80 plus gold
version we've already seen the limited
edition 1000 watt 80 plus platinum and
that's okay here we go and then we've
also seen the 1250 watt 80 plus gold as
well so the key difference between the
1050 watt 80 plus gold and the 1250 watt
80 plus gold is going to be in the GPU
support so the 1050 watt unit is only
rated for 1050 watts which you know what
some would argue you could probably get
away with a four way graphics card
configuration but it wouldn't really be
my recommendation I've said during the
12 50 watt one that you could get away
with it with 1250 and I stand by that
especially now that AMD has released
their new 7970 graphics cards which we
found out actually don't consume much
more power in fact if any than the 69 70
which is a really good sign what that
means is maybe we're kind of getting to
the end of this more power with every
generation of graphics card thing so you
can buy a power supply now that's good
for three to four high end GPUs
depending which capacity you buy and be
confident that it's going to work with
the next generation product so this one
right here is 80 plus gold is 1050 watt
and it is it comes equipped with three
PCI Express modular cables each of which
has two six plus two pin connectors at
the end so it's ready for three graph
six cards by default also comes with
black screws for installing it in your
case as well as a super beefy thick
power cord now this is one of the killer
features of this guy right here the I
would never even consider turning it off
this is hybrid fan mode and what hybrid
fan mode does is when your power supply
is under hold on let me just double
check yes when your power supply is
under 20 percent load which let's face
it a 1050 watt power supply is usually
going to be under 20% load especially
when you're idling when it's under 20%
load the fan turns off completely this
is not a flaw this is not a defect this
is by design so what that means is
you're not accumulating dust in your
grill and in your fan and in your power
supply because it's not even spinning
whenever your system is not actually
actively doing something which is
outstanding I think that's the coolest
thing in the world and every power
supply from now on until the end of time
should come with this feature you can't
really enable a feature like this unless
you build a very efficient power supply
though because add a thousand watts even
80-plus let's say 80% efficiency is
kicking out a lot of excess waste energy
so you have to get the I mean 80 plus
gold is up in the neighborhood of 87 to
88 percent efficiency so that is what
enables them to achieve that so in terms
of modular interface back here we've got
motherboard we've got one of these 8 pin
guys for the CPU we've got those 3 PCIe
connectors so those are for these ones
so that's up to 6 that's up to 6 plugs
off of these 3 then we've also got 1 2 3
4 5 6 peripheral connectors and I'll
show you all the cables we have 4
options for those and then over here we
have either an additional CPU connector
and this power supply actually comes
with both 8 pin CPU cables or you can
plug PCIe and so the 1250 watt comes
with that additional PCIe
this one doesn't but I don't think it's
relevant because you're not going to be
powering for graphics cards off this guy
in terms of the of the aesthetic I think
XFX has done a fantastic job of making
their power supplies stand apart from
everyone else's so you got your XFX
shiny logo there stand apart from
everyone else's without looking tacky
because you see a lot of power supplies
that stand out but they just look awful
and XFX has not gone down that path at
all well actually before we before we
wrap up here one of the things that
makes this power supply kind of unique
is if you look inside you don't see that
huge thick thing of wires running up to
the modular interface and that's because
they're using a solid link interface so
what the solid link interface does is it
takes solid pieces of metal and they're
just routed like this off the PCB up to
the modular interface rather than
running wires it's more efficient that
way and it's tidier internally which is
not only better for efficiency but also
better for cooling let me just see if
there's anything I'm missing here we've
covered easy rail we covered solid link
and we covered hybrid fan control so all
those major ones are there and then what
have we got over here yes okay yes true
wattage guarantee it is 1050 watts of
continuous power lesser power supply
brands are known to leave out things
like some of the automatic protection
sensors which are all in this guy and to
not actually deliver continuous power at
a realistic operating temperature which
XFX is rating at 50 degrees which I
would say is even a little bit
aggressive most power supplies are not
going to be 50 degrees internally under
really any circumstances we're talking
50 degree internal temperatures in your
case which doesn't happen very often so
there that's the example of the solid
link versus the the big thing of wires
that goes out to that soldered modular
interface that looks really messy and
unrealistic but trust me most of them
look like that solidly okay so I think
we've pretty much covered everything
there so let's have a look at what we've
got in terms of peripheral connectors
and then I think we're pretty much
wrapping it up we've got our 24 pin here
and then in terms of options here so for
SATA we've got a three theta
another three SATA another three SATA
and a two SATA so that when I'd probably
run up to my optical drive and then the
others I'd use for hard drives or SSDs
we've got one of those molex to do a
floppy adapter in case you still use any
floppy connectors in your system we've
got a two molex and 2x3 molexes so you
can choose whatever so you can plug in
whatever you want because it is
modular so thank you for checking out my

supply from XFX don't forget to
