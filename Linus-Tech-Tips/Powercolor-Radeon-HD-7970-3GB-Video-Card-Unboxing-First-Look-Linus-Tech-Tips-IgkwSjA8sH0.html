this and I'm sorry okay I am gonna make
excuses because honestly I did not get a
review sample card so I wasn't able to
do that and then I had to go to CES so I
wasn't able to do it I was preparing to
go and then I was gone and then now I'm
back and now I'm cat getting caught up
so yes I am finally doing my unboxing of
the Radeon HD 7970 that you've probably
seen somebody do a video about it
already at this point and yes they were
faster than me and yes that's okay um my
ego is not too damaged by not being the
first one to unbox this on the YouTube
so here we go today's card is going to
be from power color although honestly at
launch that's not terribly important
because most partners are not going to
have any kind of non-reference design
cards XFX
does have a card that is using a
non-reference cooler however it is still
using the reference PCB and reference
components this is the way it works with
all launch cards particularly on the
high end for both AMD and NVIDIA so
whatever you're about to look at inside
this power color box is sort of a couple
accessories maybe a game bundle here
they're pretty much exactly what you
would find inside the box of one of
power colors competitors which is to say
that our color given that their price is
pretty good is probably a fairly good
choice for a 7970 all right we have a
driver disc which you shouldn't use you
should download the latest we have
professional cooling system oh no these
are just this is just ads for like other
power color stuff as well as a
QuickStart guide we have a dirt three
code which you don't get to have because
it belongs to whoever ends up with this
card ah which might be me
you never know I'm kind of like in the
79 70 at this point in time this is a 28
nanometer graphics card so now that I
shouldn't say it's a 28 nanometer
graphics card because it's clearly a lot
bigger than 28 nanometers but what it is
is
is using a 28 nanometer GPU that is the
manufacturing process and I'm going to
finally extract these accessories there
we go oh thank you for catching that so
what that means is basically lower power
consumption than previous manufacturing
processes so that means that AMD has the
ability to squeeze 4.3 billion
transistors into a space that previously
they were not able to because you guys
got to understand there's the overhead
of R&amp;amp;D when you're producing chips and
then other than that the actual cost of
the silicon wafer doesn't vary a whole
lot from process node to process node I
mean you can get slightly more expensive
materials as you keep going but the
whole idea is that if you can build more
transistors in a smaller area the chip
the whole thing actually costs less but
if they take the other approach and they
build just more transistors into the
same area that it'll cost the same but
it'll be more powerful and that's what
we have with the Radeon 7970 so it
supports up to four displays in
Eyefinity mode so you've got your DVI or
HDMI as well as dual mini and
DisplayPort there you go I'm just gonna
put those plugs back in hate for hate
for something to leak out of them or
something although I don't think that's
likely to happen this particular graphic
crack on the back you can see okay here
here here let's just fine we'll just
take them all off there all right what
else is cool so 28 nanometer GPU all
right 384 bit memory bus so AMD s
somehow managed to put all of the
graphics memory on the other side of the
PCB which is pretty pretty densely
packed you can actually see where they
are here and so what that means is huge
massive memory bandwidth so we're still
using gddr5 but we are able to write to
it and read from it more quickly so
enormous bandwidth also an enormous
frame buffer this card has a three
gigabyte frame buffer now we've seen
this before
GTX 580 have a three gig frame buffer
but honestly the GPU wasn't really
powerful enough to take advantage of it
anyhow GTX 590 had a three gig frame
buffer so did Radeon 69 note 6990 was 4
gig sorry about that
so 590 had a 3 gig frame buffer but
when you're running two GPUs in SLI or
crossfire you're only able to take
advantage of half of that frame buffer
so if you were to take two of these
three gig cards and run them in
crossfire you would have three gigs of
effective memory whereas if you took a
GTX 590 and ran it in your system it's
running an SLI by default you actually
only have 1.5 gigs which is fine for
single display up to huge resolutions
but if you want to go multi monitor
gaming it's probably not going to be
suitable in the latest games running at
very high detail settings another new
thing about this graphics card is it
uses PCI Express 3.0 so what is the
relevance of that you might ask and the
relevance of that I would answer is um
very little I'm actually wandering
around now looking to see if I can find
again three motherboard I know what
don't worry about it okay so there's a
couple motherboards on the z68 platform
I'm going to walk around this way let's
go look at the card I guess for now
there's a couple motherboards on the z68
platform that are using PCIe gen3
compatible slots but right now it
doesn't even work because Ivy Bridge
Intel's upcoming CPU which will have
piece a PCIe gen3 controller on board
isn't even out yet so we're basically
these motherboards are just saying
they're ready for you to open a new CPU
and a new graphics card to get gen3
compatibility so there's that and
there's also the fact that PCI Express
16 X like Gen 1 like PCI Express 16 X is
still plenty for a single graphics card
so what does this mean to you well every
time we go up a generation in PCI
Express we are doubling the available
bandwidth so PCIe 2 is 2 times the
bandwidth the PCIe 1 and PCIe gen3 is 4
times the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 1 what
that means is that a PCIe gen to 8 X
slot which is what we find on z68 boards
is already capable of feeding a high-end
graphics card pretty much no matter how
I undo it no matter how high-end it is
so with PCIe gen3 we're going to get the
ability to run high-end graphics cards
in our PCIe 4x slots that looks to be
about it so we may actually be able to
run like 3-way SLI and crossfire setups
on like you know 4 4 4 4 slot layouts
and
not have any performance hits so I guess
that's cool but I mean motherboards
already has so many PCIe slots with so
much bandwidth I'm not not concerned
about it just right now so there you go
PCIe gen3 so yes more bandwidth is
probably better at some point but right
now I don't think it's going to make
that much of a difference has a sticker
on it huh what the Radeon h7t 970 huh
funny okay it has a what we've come to
expect as a standard AMD blower cooler
fan which is great because it means it's
exhausting all of the air out the back
of the case so you're not going to have
this thing reheating itself although is
runs surprisingly quiet and cool
considering that this is Bar None by a
significant margin the fastest single
GPU graphics card on the planet so yes
it does lose to the 590 it does lose to
the 6990 faster than a GTX 580 which was
the previous king of the castle and it
also over clocks like a beast
speaking of overclocking you've got two
BIOS profiles here so you can keep one
at factory default you can flash
alternate bios's to the other one and
play around with it and see how far you
can push this card AMD has built in that
mod ability to their cards which hold on
let me split this down
which is awesome so I personally
appreciate that very very much I think
we've pretty much wrapped up here I
don't think I see anything on my notes
over there that looks irrelevant so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and by this time it's probably about
your 18th look at the Radeon H 7970
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos I'm clearly out of
practice because I forgot to show you it
has an 8 pin and a 6 pin power connector
and I also forgot to show you the
included accessories so it does have
HDMI to DVI mini DisplayPort to
DisplayPort mini DisplayPort to is this
active Oh active DVI cool so it does
support dual DVI right on the box
triple DVI right out of the box wow you
have everything you need to run
eyefinity right out of the box and then
a 6 pin 2 8 pin power adapter a DVI to
vga adapter and finally a crossfire
connector</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
