be unboxing the Nissan GTR this is a
fully sporty vehicle that I can
definitely fit inside and drive know but
seriously this is a remote-control car
I'm not sure why we have them but NCIX
has these for sale and so I saw one in
the warehouse and I was like okay and I
figured maybe I better open one up on
the channel and have a look and let you
guys know you know what's what's good
and what's not is good about the Nissan
GTR which cameraman was actually making
fun of me for before we started this
because I have no idea what a Nissan GTR
is because I'm a total car newb I don't
know if you guys have seen the unboxing
I did on my car but it's like a grandpa
mobile Honda Civic so there's nothing
nothing even remotely impressive about
it okay so here's the operation guide
please install the batteries into the
car please install the batteries into
the controller oh you got to be kidding
me it takes five double-a batteries what
takes five batteries that's ridiculous
okay push the switch to the on position
adjust the direction a plastic bag is
not for playings okay direct sunlight
okay we got full function radio control
reverse left and right forward and
forward light and reverse light it has
lights yo authentic car styling with
injection molded body okay here I'll let
you read that while I figure out how the
GTR comes out of the packaging okay
actually hold on turn out the camera for
a second I got to figure out how to get
another package so this is kind of
ridiculous but it's actually screwed
into the cardboard for whatever reason
so we're installing some batteries into
the car in the remote right now got my
trusty and loops and we're gonna we're
going to get this going pretty quick for
you guys here
okay that's in I'm not going to bother
closing this up so okay there I saw I
saw flashing light on here okay so when
I press on it the lights are working so
all I have to do is flip the switch on
the car to the on position this is
apparently a no.9 GTR well there it goes
nice okay so here I'm artha are the
headlights lit can you can you see here
they lit oh yeah they light when it
moves forward okay oh I stepped on a
keyboard okay here you're here so hey
that actually moves pretty good here
let's take this out into the warehouse
follow me
let's go let's go so this is where we
had our warehouse clearance sale oh I'm
gonna rage I'm at a rage okay so this is
about the max range of this car hold on
I'm gonna turn on the light in here so
you guys can see a little better
oh this is it yeah there we go okay so I
don't know if you saw the headlights
before but yeah it has headlights been
light up when it goes forward it
actually the hall is pretty good here so
the speed is pretty good you can see if
I try and drive in the frame
it actually turns a little bit to the
right but it's got an adjustment on the
bottom so I can if I adjust it a little
bit to the left quite possible that we
will be able to remedy that problem see
let's see if that works
Hey already okay also when you reverse
it does have two lights that go on
although they're not reverse lights
they're brake lights are like signal
lights that for whatever reasons you're
not on the carbon versus
to us look at the third honey
yeah that's what the GTR thinks of Mac
people
boom-boom-boom-boom
oh it's done thanks for watching - tech
tips and yeah this was an entirely
pointless episode I hope you enjoyed it
okay actually we went into the cafeteria
and we're gonna do some donuts
haha no
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
