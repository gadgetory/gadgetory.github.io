not expecting to receive one of these in
the mail but I did so now we're going to
be doing an unboxing memory is not
included which Kingston so helpfully
points out right on the front this is
one of the sharper looking memory fans
that I've seen we'll have a closer look
at it when I get it open but let's have
a quick look at the specs which we'll
find on the back features are maximize
your performance potential with HyperX
memory and probably any other memory
twin fans direct airflow onto the memory
modules and the blue anodized fan
assembly fits most gaming systems it is
whisper quiet at 28 decibels maximum and
it is a 12 volt rated with an able to 13
bulb operational range so they are
saying that it can be under bolted the
fans spin at 3000 rpm and why don't we
get this box opened up I will use my
handy scissors to slice open the
packaging which did not work at all and
so what I will do is I will use the
scissors to cut a little gap in the
packaging and then I will peel it back
with my hands cameraman is giving me one
of those looks like what are you doing
but I don't care because I'm not
accountable to him so my phone's ringing
that back at my desk but there's nothing
I can do about that now here we are we
have a warranty and installation guide
so it is a hundred percent tested that
means that it's not like like 60 percent
tested where they test like the metal
and the one fan and don't test that fan
100% tested with an infinity lifetime
warranty that is awesome this is the
only RAM fan I've seen with a lifetime
warranty and then here is a quick
installation guide and I guess I'd
better get started on on this
installation process so that I can
actually show you how to do it on camera
before you get bored okay so we find E
which is quite wide and the camera
turned off I'm not sure why the the fan
is got a braided sleeve on it and that
is a very high quality sleeving you can
tell because you can't see the silver
color of the fan wires at all you can
just see the black braided sleeving
looks very nice these appear to be LED
fans although I I guess I'd hazard a
guess that they're probably blue but I
don't know for sure that the LEDs are
blue but they have one two three four
LEDs on each fan so this is going to
look quite sharp when it's installed in
your system so here let me I'll just
kind of put that there and you can sort
of visualize what it's going to look
like while I work on getting the clips
out of their packaging here I got one
clip out so the clips look like this
these are actually really nice I'm a
little bit surprised because unlike some
of the other RAM fans I've seen they use
like quite a thick gauge of metal for
the clips it's got a nice blue anodized
finish it's actually got quite a bit of
glitter to it so it's quite sharp
looking and they've got the Kingston
HyperX X in both sides there so it's
very Kingston branded but you kind of
expect that when you buy a product
that's basically just designed to sit on
top of your other Kingston product and
it's made by Kingston okay so these
thumb screws come with the washers pre
applied so someone is actually putting
washers on every thumb screw before they
ship these things for you which is
pretty great in my opinion because you
see so many products these days that
just have sort of you know a bag here's
all the hardware oh this I like check
this out okay
unlike and I'm going to go ahead and
call out the Corsair one here unlike the
Corsair one there's that here actually
let me put the screw in first before I
say this is really good because it might
be terrible still hold on okay so that
goes in there so there's a little washer
okay so that just screws in right there
and then let's do the other side really
quick so that just threads right into
the top piece oh shoot I put it in the
wrong way
Oh hold on trouble trouble back up abort
abort there there now sand all actually
hold on maybe goes here then does it go
there no no that's for the fans this
goes here yeah well we'll find out one
way or another based on how short these
screws are though I'm assuming it goes
kind of in the top there so I'm just
gonna yep there we go
that there oh when the other place come
oh there we go I figured you don't okay
so this wasn't as easy to put on the
clip as it initially looked like it was
going to be but I still give Kingston
kudos for having like a place where it
just kind of sits and is centered
because the coarser one is like really
hard to hold in the right place while
you're trying to put it on and that
makes things a little bit more difficult
so you know I kind of maybe what we'll
do is we'll just we'll grab a power cord
from somewhere I don't know if I have
one in here and then we'll just like
turn on that system so you can see what
it looks like when it's on - that would
be pretty cool
get this last screw put on here
cameraman is getting impatient he's not
even like looking at what I'm doing
anymore he's just holding the camera
it's just you know phoning it in okay so
here we've got a fan header right there
so in order to apply this you want to go
ahead and close all of those so you put
the clip over the one side of the RAM
modules here cameraman come over here so
you can see what I'm doing here
so you put the clip over the one side of
the memory modules and then you put the
other clip over here now you can see
that it's not going to sit quite even
because of the way I Seuss designed
these memory slots but that's not really
a big deal the HyperX fan sits quite
high up over the memory so you'd
actually be able to use tall modules
whether from Kingston or or some other
manufacturer without the memory fan
getting in the way so that's that's a
pretty cool feature right there as well
so here let me see if I can find a power
cord yeah I got one so you look even
Cameron has as PC power cords lying
around he's learning from the best here
so let's plug this in and then you know
what I don't think I even have the
motherboard bugged in so you're gonna
have to bear with me here for just a
second while I plug in the 24 pin I
wonder if that's going to be enough to
get to start yeah hey that looks
terrific
and here's something to be cognizant of
I got to move it over a little bit
because it was actually interfering with
my CPU fan so you don't want to move it
over so far that it brushes up against
the CPU fan but that looks great on the
rampage three extreme which I I wouldn't
have really
because it's a red-and-black themed
motherboard but you go and put that like
blue on there to go along with the blue
CPU cooler and it's uh looks pretty cool
it's blowing down a fair amount of air
and I'll stop talking for a minute here
let the cameraman move in closer you can
hear how loud it is I'm just going to
stop the CPU fan cameraman moved close
so they can hear you can't really hear
it anyway because it's pretty quiet
anyway there you have it that is the
HyperX fan unboxing and an first look
and it looks pretty good
at first look thank you for checking out
