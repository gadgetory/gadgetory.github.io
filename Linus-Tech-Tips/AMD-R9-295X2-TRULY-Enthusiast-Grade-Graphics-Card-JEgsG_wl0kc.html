gaming PC look no further than the
obsidian series 250 d from Corsair click
now to learn more thanks to our generous
monthly contributors we have a fun money
budget to do videos about stuff that we
don't get a sample of sometimes so we
spend about a hundred of it paying
two-way shipping for this monstrosity so
we could borrow
Austin's AMD r9 295x2 dual GPU behemoth
of a graphics card for some benchmarking
fun we'll kick things off with specs and
I actually think the most interesting
thing about them is how uninteresting
they are normally when we get a dual GPU
graphics card we get to analyze how many
CUDA cores or stream processors were cut
and hypothesize about how the
manufacturer decided what reduced clock
speed to run at to stay within power and
thermal limits not here this card is
just a big pile of aluminum shrouded
fully back plated sexiness with two
flat-out r9 290x Hawaii core GPUs on it
each with all 2,816 stream processors
all four gigs of glorious video memory
connected via a non nerf 512 bit memory
bus and the best part is both of them
are actually rated at slightly higher
boost clocks compared to an r9 290x
which due to its unique cooling solution
it even manages to sustain consistently
unlike a standalone r9 290x wow we've
also got the usual AMD technologies
including zero core which turns off the
second GPU at idle to save power DirectX
11 and future DirectX 12 support AMD
mantle support trueaudio
Eyefinity with support for up to five
direct-attached displays and more with
MST hubs bridgeless crossfire with up to
two of these monstrosity x' capable of
running a for GPU setup and excellent
OpenCL compute performance but that's
all normal stuff what about the
challenges that had to be overcome to
build this bad boy aside from designing
it's complicated PCB and beef tastic
power delivery circuitry which you'll
find under a dedicated copper heatsink
under its own dedicated red LED fan AMD
had to find a way to cool a card that
they have raided
a massive 500 watt TDP I mean that is
well beyond any previous reference
graphics card the most we've seen before
is 375 watts and it meant we were either
going to end up with a leaf blower
attached to the card or a pretty exotic
cooling solution
fortunately AMD went with the exotic
cooling solution route and that's what
you see here this card has an all-in-one
liquid cooler from ASA tech included out
of the box it's not the world's most
exceptional AIO with a single 38
millimeter thick 120 millimeter radiator
and dual block / pump combo unit design
and in fact it's not even the first time
a dual AMD GPU card has been handled
this way I'm looking at you Ares 2 but
the remarkable thing about it is that
this is the first reference card from
AMD or Nvidia that uses a solution like
this so what are the pros and cons of
this unique and expensive card aside
from the price advantage number one with
water we can carry heat away from the
GPUs much more quickly than we can with
air to a large heat exchanger in this
case a radiator with lots of surface
area that we can cool with large
relatively quiet fans and in practice it
works the r9 295x2 runs at about 70
degrees under load well under the 95
degrees of a 290x advantage number two
because this radiator can be located
some distance away the heat can be
exhausted directly from the case and the
card can remain a reasonable size so it
will actually fit in a fairly standard
albeit longer than usual at 305
millimeters to slot form factor so more
space and cooler operation for your
other components sounds dandy right now
hold on drawback number one to power
this sucker you need two PCI Express
eight pin power connectors and not just
any old ones you can't use daisy-chained
plugs that lead to a single connector on
your power supply and you'll even need
to check which power supply connectors
are wired up to which 12-volt rails on a
multi rail power supply in your PS use
manual ensure you've got at least 28
ants on each of them to correctly power
the card or you could be looking at a
fire situation drawback number two is
the form factor it'll fit in your PCI
Express slots for sure but
you'll need extra clearance between the
card and the side panel for the tubing
to come out extra clearance behind the
card for its over 12 inch length and
you'll need a nearby 120 millimeter fan
mount with 65 millimeters of clearance
for your liquid cooling radiator and fan
fortunately AMD includes long enough
tubing that you should be able to rear
or top mount it in most cases drawback
number three is heat and power
consumption yes the heat is managed but
it's still being kicked out into your
room which might be a boon in the winter
but isn't so much fun in the summer and
even compared to a gtx 780 Ti SLI set up
this card consumes between 100 to 200
watts more power in games which if
you're in California and you game for
about three hours a day will amount to
about an extra five to seven dollars on
your monthly power bill and then of
course the last drawback is price but if
you didn't know this card was going to
be expensive than stop dreaming so now
after all that the last thing you're
probably waiting for is performance but
before I hand off to Luke I would like
to take a moment to genuinely thank AMD
for making this card people complaining
about all those crazy requirements I
outlined before and how much of a crazy
Frankenstein science fair experiment of
a solution this card is compared to most
products that actually get a consumer
release need to go away and go buy
something that was made for them what
AMD has delivered here compared to their
competitors like Intel and NVIDIA is the
first product that I've seen in years
that I can say is truly enthusiast grade
but what does enthusiast grade mean to
me I did to me it doesn't mean fast or
elegant necessarily I mean it's great if
it can be faster elegant but what to me
it means is pushing the boundaries of
what's possible with modern engineering
and manufacturing and if that results in
a little bit of hassle during the setup
process a little bit of heaven forbid
actual research and planning before you
can use it then so be it I've been
calling for Intel to do away with their
130 watt TDP limit and give us a proper
enthusiasts grade Extreme Edition for
ages something that requires water
cooling with a top grade motherboard to
work properly but that legitimately
stomps on the consumer grade offerings
available and they just don't do it as
it is and
cost hundreds of dollars more than a K
and delivers a couple percent better
performance it's fast yeah but it's not
actually tailored to the enthusiast and
Vidya is slightly better in this regard
they do enable partners like EVGA to
build crazy stuff like the twin series
and kingpin Series cards but AMD has
upped the ante by creating a reference
product that really pushes the
boundaries and I applaud them for it
over to you Luke alright guys so today
we're testing an AMD 295x2 versus dual
780 Ti is from Nvidia for the AMD card
I've done my work locking settings in
AMD overdrive over overclocked to the
core by about 8% and I've overclocked
the memory by 135 remember that's times
by 4 when calculating the overall memory
bandwidth for the Nvidia cards I've only
changed their core speed and I've
increased it by 250 this is because of
auto balancing power rails so I don't
really mess with the memory too much if
you guys want to see all the rest of my
overclocking settings be sure to check
the overclocking dock linked below in
all of these graphics cards comparison
videos and let's move on and see how
those results end up in BioShock
Infinite and theif these cards trade
back and forth and it's not by huge
amounts so it's not too surprising and
then in Assassin's Creed 4 we see that
there was a bottleneck somewhere else in
the computer I wanted to show this
result because it shows that they
perform very well on their own but then
it's not that great in comparison
because again there's something else in
the computer slowing these cards down if
you guys want to learn more about
bottlenecks be sure to check out Linus's
tech quickie episode but fast as
possible talking about bottlenecks and
all that kind of stuff you can learn
about bottlenecks there in terms of
general observations I'm fairly happy
with this card when I first heard
announce I expect it to be one loud and
- really really hot but it's neither a
name the overdrive at caps this
temperature at 75 degrees and it's
audible level is pretty consistent
through the whole time of using it due
to that external radiator so I'm quite
happy about those things alright guys
thanks for watching please don't forget
to like and dislike this video and leave
your comment down below if you guys do
want to comment on this video on the
forum
I'll highly suggest doing that while
you're on the forum if you get annoyed
by ads or anything like that be sure to
become a contributor as all those ads
will disappear immediately it's quite
fantastic and just so you guys know we
do sell shirts as
well there should be down in the
description below and I know there's
there's a new I'd mount that one with a
cooler on it that a lot of people are
freaking out about on Twitter so that
should be cool there's something cool
Camila works in the shirt department
fairly soon that edsel is going to be
cooking up so pay attention to that I
will see you guys next time thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
