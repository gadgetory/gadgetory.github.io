value gaming laptop
excuse me linus adele gaming laptop
where's the Alienware at son while it's
true that even a base-model 15 in jail
Ian where would perform better than its
inspiring cousin here it would also cost
twelve hundred US dollars compared to
only eight hundred for this one so let's
find out how much portable gaming
machine you can get for eight hundred
bucks
the mastercase 5 from Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to make your mid-tower
pc case your own with a variety of
modular parts and accessories check out
the link in the video description to
learn more so let me preface the video
with this the last inspiring laptop that
I ever used extensively was a mobile
Pentium 3 based machine I mean we're
talking pre widescreen days here and
this is what I imagined the look on my
face would be like if I was going to
call someone up and tell them about how
exciting it was to use so to say that I
was impressed as I went through my
physical tour routine would definitely
be an understatement our 75 59 is the
blackened red accent model so it should
come as no surprise then that the top
lid is black with a red Dell logo moving
on the screen hinge is a definite gold
star for the Inspiron it opens smoothly
with one finger and suffers from zero
discernable wobble while typing
screenflex is what I would describe as
average not impressive considering its
thickness but nothing that affects
usability the screen itself is a matte
finish 1080p affair that didn't dazzle
me with its brightness or anything but
thanks to the use of an IPS panel it
delivers very solid color and viewing
angle performance then above that is a
surprisingly decent 720p 30fps webcam
with a dual micro ray I mean between
that in the screen I'm actually kind of
amazed at how much of an improvement
this is over the commodity laptops of
yesteryear and what a difference that
those little things make to being able
to recommend them but of course without
solid specs a webcam is just a webcam so
first is IO
on the right is a Gigabit Ethernet jack
and HDMI 1.4 output a super speed USB 3
five gigabit port and an SD card reader
on the left is a headphone microphone
combo jack 2 more USB 3 ports a red
accented exhaust vent and the power
input which leads us to the internal
guts we've got a base model here with a
core i5 6300 HQ non hyper threaded 2.3
to 3.2 gigahertz quad core 8 gigs of
single-channel ram more on this later a
1 terabyte hard drive with a built in
gig SSD cache a whopping 74 watt our
battery rated at just under 10 hours on
our config AC Wi-Fi and the thing that
really made the inspire on 75 59 catch
my eye because lord knows it wasn't the
name i gtx 960m for gig video card now
to be clear the 960m is still not a
top-tier gaming GPU even for mobile I
mean for context a 970 n is 60 to 70
percent faster but my satisfaction with
this GPU is also not random compared to
previous value gaming offerings from
tier one manufacturers like Dell Acer or
Lenovo that would have liked X 40 or X
50 class GPUs if you're lucky this is a
huge step forward I mean in terms of
performance at the 75 59 s native 1080p
resolution Tomb Raider 2013 and Crysis 3
run in a manner that I would describe as
playable at settings that would have
been previously unthinkable and that I'd
consider a reasonable experience in last
gen triple-a games then I mean if you
were to only play you know free-to-play
games like League of Legends or even you
know less graphically demanding paid
games like Counter Strike global
Offensive you might start to question
why you would even need anything more
and that's a good question that leads me
pretty well into my next well negative
and positive things about this machine
from a bummer standpoint the GPU like
the vast majority of laptops is not
upgradeable in any way even from the
factory so if you're a pure gamer an
$800 desktop will still serve you better
but the cool thing is that there are a
lot of other aspects of this machine
that are upgradable the eight gigs of
ram is a single ddr3 low-voltage stick
so moving to two 16 gig sticks in dual
channel does it require you to discard
any there is an m dot 2 slot for a boot
SSD to go along with your tuna 1/2 inch
hard drive so with a couple of
inexpensive aftermarket upgrades that
can be performed with a Phillips head
screwdriver in about 5 minutes thanks to
the thoughtful single-cell
retaining screw design on the bottom
plate for under $1,000 you can throw
together a config that makes a lot more
sense to me then the thousand dollar
config on the Dell site where you're
just paying a bunch extra for the core
i7 but what are you giving up then I
mean so far this thing sounds pretty
much perfect lattice and yeah there are
definitely things I mean if you've
watched a few of my laptop videos you've
probably realized by now that I had
never mentioned the keyboard it's not
great it's not terrible and there's very
little flex to the wrist rest and the
keyboard surface itself but the key
traps wobble more than I'd like
and the keystrokes are pretty mushy and
the touchpad is actually much worse than
the keyboard to the point where I'd call
it more of a press pad very light
touches can fail to register outright
making fine adjustments somewhat
difficult and there's more the large
battery means that the 75 59 while
reasonably thin is pretty heavy for its
size the speakers are surprisingly loud
but don't sound very good and the Intel
3160 1x1 Wi-Fi solution is literally
one-quarter the speed in real-world
transfer tests of other more premium
solutions we have here in the office but
believe it or not all of that still adds
up to a recommendation here because
there are more things that they got
right as well under gaming load the 75
59 stays shockingly quiet and even runs
passively while performing basic desktop
tasks thanks to its three heat sinks and
the overall fit and finish while not
comparable to something like a blade 14
is damn good considering the price
speaking of damn good considering the
price you know it's a good price free
