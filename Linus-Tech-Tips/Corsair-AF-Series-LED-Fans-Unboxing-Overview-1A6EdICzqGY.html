learn more this my friends is one of the
simplest unboxings I've ever done
because if you watch my videos you'll
already know everything there is to know
about Corsairs AAF series fans so
airflow series fans if you don't already
know if you do you can skip ahead are
optimized for airflow that is to say
that they are not optimized for static
pressure as much and they are intended
for use in environments where they have
open air moving through them so things
like case exhaust and intake as opposed
to mounting them directly on radiators
or CPU heat sinks now the AF series has
just received a facelift it hasn't
necessarily gotten more functional in
any way because the old AF series
actually has some stuff that the new
ones don't such as the color change
rings that can be swapped on them and
the rubber isolating mounts in the
corners but the new AF series definitely
look cooler so they've added translucent
frosted blades right there see that
looks pretty nice pretty cool ok and
they've also added LEDs so they're
available in two different sizes at
launch so that is red blue white and
purple and they're available in did I
say two different sizes red blue white
and purple cable two different sizes 120
millimeter and 140 millimeter and four
different colors red blue white and
purple other than that I don't know what
else to say about them they're going to
be better than your generic OAM grade
fans because they do use custom molded
blades as opposed to most led fans where
the manufacturer takes an approach of
okay let's find whatever gate loon or
whoever is making and will ask for it to
be clear and have some LEDs in it word
that hasn't nothing's been done over a
very very OEM fan other than drill some
holes in it and put some LEDs in it so
at least there's that thank you for
checking out my unboxing an overview of
course there's AF LED series fans and
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment if
you have some kind of a comment even if
it's just like sweet LED fans for my
system and they're made by crosshair yea
and
without further ado enjoy some b-roll of
these fans in a pretty sweet-looking
system with the different colors on
display</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
