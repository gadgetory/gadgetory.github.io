these or one of these and I bet you're
enjoying your PC doubling as your room
heater that's been a running joke for
over 15 years now so we figured then why
not purpose build a system that is
specifically designed from the get-go to
warm your room could this actually be
practical and how would it compare to a
purpose-built space heater stay tuned to
find out after I tell you about our
sponsor noble chairs their icon series
real leather edition gaming chair was
designed in Germany and inspired by
luxury sports car interiors learn more
at the link below
let's start with some college dropout
level physics according to the first law
of thermodynamics energy can neither be
created nor destroyed it can only be
changed from one form into another
which means that other than the small
amount of kinetic energy to turn like
your fans and the light energy to run
your dope-ass RGB all of the power being
consumed by your gaming rig right now is
being dumped into the room as waste heat
making every PC basically a
sophisticated space heater alright so
this is our space heater PC it's got an
AMD thread Ripper processor it's got a
GTX ten-eighty it's got a fan 'less
power supply so you know we're not
generating any more kinetic energy than
we absolutely have to and the whole
thing has been tuned to match the power
consumption of this guy right here one
of the key aspects of the design of the
system was using eks phoenix mlc water
cooling kit so it's a modular liquid
cooler that allows us to quickly connect
or disconnect any components we want so
we can either use an internal radiator
for testing purposes or unplug the whole
thing here to connect it to our external
cooler this is Bertha she's a little
rough around the edges but with this
plan we think we can use an old radiant
heater which would traditionally be
hooked up to a gas firing something to
cool our PC and heats our room so first
order of business whenever you find our
radiator behind like a Jamaican guys
house is cleaning now cleaning something
like this is not as straightforward as
you know throwing some water in it
shaking it around and calling it a day
we filled the radiator up with water and
vinegar let it sit for 24 hours and
drained it the contents
we're the worst
after the initial flush we filled the
radiator up with tap water and let it
run upside-down for a while
messing up Ivan's LTT adidas in the
process oh no my shoes oh oh after half
an hour of running water at tap pressure
through it it started to look clean now
in order to mate the radiators original
piping to our water cooling hoses we
needed to thread the stock pipe
unfortunately the dye bit so hard on
reverse that the tube disconnected from
the adjacent elbow and when we tried to
vice the tube without the elbow it oval
eyes luckily we had compatible sections
from another project sitting around so
we teflon tape the threads and here's
the result after rigging the radiator up
with an industrial pump and a reservoir
we were ready to fill it up Ivan was so
upset that I got his adidas wet that you
can clearly see him trying to
electrocute me here completely turn off
the water Ivan there's so much water
we're gonna kill the pom oh the good
news is that he failed better luck next
time chump the bad news is that with the
liquid pumping at an industrial pump
pressure it's so dirty
not only did it become brownish again
but we also detected a minor leak it is
a pretty substantial leak that like that
will affect no that won't work
you need to flaunt ape with this
tightening it more will not work after
going Gordon Freeman on the joint with a
crowbar we were able to disconnect it
and teflon tape it adding a key line
drain in the process you know just in
case good thing - it ended up taking
four fills and flushes before the water
stayed clear now as those of you who
watched our full room water cooling
project no mixing metals in a loop
essentially creates a battery causing
corrosion this can be mitigated by
adding sacrificial anodes to the loop
but due to our testing being very
short-term we omitted this step while we
were doing all that we had our space
heater running inside the room that we
call the sanity closet so in here and
didn't want anybody opening this door
because that would let the stank out so
to speak so in here this is a five cubic
meter room
approximately accounting for the the
boxes kind of taking up some of it we've
got a wirelessly monitor Abul
temperature sensor here and then we had
our 350 watt heater running here so the
sanity closet started at twenty three
point seven degrees Celsius which is our
office temperature and then what we've
done is we have configured our tests to
stop at thirty six point seven degrees
which is the temperature of the human
body you wouldn't really want your room
any warmer the matter would start to
feel like a sauna
so if our PC heats up this room from the
same temperature to the same temperature
in the same amount of time then we
consider our experiment a success one
last thing we needed some kind of
opening at the back of the case to pipe
the quick disconnects through finally we
just needed to drag our beast into the
closet hook her up to the radiator via
the quick disconnects so all we got to
do is hook these babies up to these
babies and let it bake for a bit finally
time to check on this and see how we did
with our PC so this is interesting
our FPS are lower and even though it's
water-cooled art GPU isn't over it's
over 85 degrees whoa our power
consumption is only about 275 280 watts
our graphics card is thermal throttling
okay let's have a look at what's going
on in here whoa wow that is a heat wave
and I think it's pretty clear what
happened
it looks like wool that's hot oh oh
I think once our system heated up it
made it easier for it to gather gunk
that was still stuck on the inside of
the radiator oh that's a real shame all
right come on over here Dennis come have
a look oh so here's our GP yeah okay
our GPU is totally gummed up what a
shame so that affects the amount of heat
that we were kicking out into the room
actually we found this silver lining
here so we didn't factor in that this
high-powered pub consumes a lot of power
it turns out that it's actually about 75
watts so our numbers should still be
okay
okay so after importing all the data it
wasn't immediately obvious how it all
came together and made sense because
upon initial inspection they actually
look like really different results
between the space heater and the PC but
what we didn't factor in initially
looking at it is the immense thermal
mass of the water inside the radiator so
what's actually happening here is that
water is taking a long time to begin to
heat up enough that the radiator itself
is able to start dissipating heat to the
surrounding air so in effect all we need
to do is time shift our graph a little
bit and what you can see is that even
though the PC in legs about two degrees
behind the space heater they both hate
the room at the same rate so conclusion
time can you use your PC as a heater for
your room
the answer is yes but we don't recommend
the way we did it because if you do it
the way we did it you're gonna lag
behind by two degrees and all gamers
know that any amount of lag is
unacceptable which obviously is totally
not the problem like this this this gunk
in the in the water that's that's the
problem speaking of problems if you
don't already have a VPN that's a
problem go check out private Internet
access they support a variety of VPN
protocols and types of encryption and
authentication which allows you to dial
in the exact level of privacy protection
that you need they've got apps for
Windows Mac OS Android iOS Linux and
Google Chrome with support for other
platforms coming soon you can connect up
to five devices at the same time in
their apps include DNS leak protection
and ipv6 leak protection with an
internet kill switch that will block all
traffic if the VPN becomes disconnected
unexpectedly so check it out today at
the link in the video description and if
you've already got PIAA hey they've got
gift cards so we'll have that linked
below as well so thanks for watching
guys if you dislike this video you can
hit that button but if you liked it you
can hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should totally join sometimes we
just do
you know it's like yep we did a thing
but why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
