- where'd you get that like test bench
thing meaning this thing okay so I have
a couple of high speed PC tech stations
yes that is what it is called it is
called a high speed PC tech station this
is a standard size so it is an ATX size
top deck tech station I actually have
one that's not a top deck tech station
at home and on that one the motherboard
goes on the bottom and the drives and
power supply go on the top it's a lot
less convenient I prefer the top deck
style so high speed PC noticing that I
use their product in my videos all the
time actually contacted me and offered
to send me their new tech station so I
am going to be upgrading my tech station
to the top deck tech station which is
the same but this is the excel model so
that is going to allow me and I need
another prop here to install
motherboards such as the g1 killer
assassin from gigabyte and test things
like four-way SLI on my tech station
which I was not able to do in the past
so high speed PC you tech station B
costs anywhere from around 100 bucks to
boot up to about $200 for some of the
higher-end models but they are
incredibly convenient and I have easily
gotten my hundred dollars worth out of
my old one and I'm sure I will get my
zero dollars worth thank you very much
high speed PC out of the new one I'm
really really excited to try this one
out so as you can see there is some
assembly required I remember the first
time I put one together my first one it
actually took me quite a long time to
figure it out that was a long time ago
that was back when when my core 2
extreme 6800 was a really high-end
processor so yeah it's definitely been a
while okay remember that was a dual core
Extreme Edition like crazy
okay so Wow okay the first thing I see
is three included fans so these are
logis fans they are black and
and they do not come with LEDs of any
sort which is good because then I
probably wouldn't install them what I've
gone to or most of my tech station needs
is actually me not to a p-series fans
because they provide good static air
flow through radiators or whatever other
coolers I use and they're not loud
because I often have the tech station
running behind me at work and I don't
want anything loud and obnoxious because
I'm trying to concentrate on things
other than my test PC whirring away in
the background so let's have a look at
the included parts here all right a lot
of people have actually asked me if I
made my tech station myself and the
answer is no although you probably could
it is so much more convenient to buy one
of these kits from high-speed pcs that
comes with all the little bits and
pieces that you need and instructions on
how to assemble them moving things like
fan guards okay so let's show you guys
everything that we got here okay first
thing how to get in touch with the
missing parts questions or other
problems contact us right away we'll do
our best to have a solution for you
within 24 hours awesome great next we
have the instructions so this just comes
on you're typically a4 paper it's like a
laser printed copy so nothing too
sophisticated but there are a fairly
small company and there's lots of nice
color pictures here that will help you
to put together your tech station
without too much trouble alright I want
to show you guys everything that's
included so this is actually here if I
show you guys a completed one that might
actually make it a little easier to
point out what everything is so this
piece right here you can see it's
actually got ten expansion slot holes on
it so this is the replacement for this
so it's just gonna be slightly longer
than my old one all right these two
right here these are the upright posts
right here that support the PCI slot
covered this harddrive mounting so on
the bottom of the tech station down here
you can see there are rails to mount a
hard drive or two hard drives under the
tech station itself alright these are
these four posts that keep the two
the top and the bottom piece apart and
supporting okay we've got motherboard
standoffs
I love the motherboard standoffs that
they use because they're awesome I'm
going to show you guys how you install a
motherboard on a tech station here so
first you take the motherboard off so
basically you've just got these little
rubber pieces right here that go right
over where the holes are and then in
order to get it lined up there's a
couple that come with little plastic
threaded spikes and the reason those
threaded spikes are so great is because
when you get them positioned push them
on its it takes a little bit of fussing
to actually lift the motherboard back up
which is perfect so holds it in place a
little bit but it also doesn't allow it
to slide around like this and it keeps
everything from shorting out because
you're using rubber to isolate the
motherboard from everything else so that
is what we have in there next we have
all of the mounting hardware required to
assemble my new top deck tech station so
you cut things like L brackets for here
we've got these caps right here which go
on the tops of your posts we've got
various different screws for fastening
everything together and finally last but
not least we have some fangirls we have
the ATX control kit which for
motherboards that do not have built-in
power and reset switch is is very
convenient because you just throw that
on the front panel headers and then boom
you have a built-in power switch or
reset switch power LED hard drive LED
and speaker so you can actually buy this
separately as well if you don't want a
tech station or if you already have a
tech station and you just lost yours or
something got a nice little neoprene pad
here so the neoprene pad is on my own
personal tech station right here is
mounted on the bottom
where it belongs and then I've also
supplemented it with some of these
non-slip things that I really like as
well so just to make sure that my
optical drive doesn't move around I
don't have one under my power supply
because my power supply has enough
weight that it's able to not slip on the
neoprene pad so the neoprene pad is
there this appears to be the bottom
piece all right and then
with all of the motherboard mounting
holes in it as well as lots of labels
from where to put stuff is the top piece
and I just want to show you guys one
last thing before I finish up my
unboxing and showcase here and that is
the overall build quality in the tech
station so in spite of having all of
this stuff on the bottom of it then this
is actually a relatively light load for
this particular one there is no chance
of it falling apart at any time even
though the way these are supported is
with screws so I've been very very happy
with my tech station over the last
couple of years and big thanks again to
high speed PC for sending me an XL AC x1
so I can bring you guys more
