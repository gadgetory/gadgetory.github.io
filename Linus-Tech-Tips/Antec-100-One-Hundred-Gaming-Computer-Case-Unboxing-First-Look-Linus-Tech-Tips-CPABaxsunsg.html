self-described as gaining performance
that won't break your bank the 100 a
member of hands hex legendary line of
gaming cases and I will agree with them
about that the hundred series with
standouts like the 900 the 300 have been
a staple for gamers everywhere I
remember going to Fraga Palooza ah gee I
guess it was a couple of years ago when
I did a bit of a walk around through the
entire whatever it was it was like a
warehouse or an arena or something I had
all those people crammed into and I was
I couldn't help noticing as I was
walking around but probably about twenty
to thirty percent of the people there
have either an antique 900 or 300 and
when you have that kind of dominance in
terms of market share inside it's
impressive regardless of what kind of
product category they're talking about
so let's see if the 100 can live up to
the tradition of those great cases now
based on the naming scheme and knowing
already that the 300 is a pretty value
oriented gaming case and the 200 is even
more so I would venture a guess that the
100 is all about value features versus
luxury features but we're gonna see
exactly what this case is all about in
just a moment here so here we go why
don't you turn it this way first the
first thing I notice about it is it
doesn't have a window which is fine not
every gamer necessarily wants a window
on their case so I'm just gonna trying
to find somewhere to stand right you're
not easily point at things but not block
all the light you know what I'm gonna
move to this side okay so the 100 we
have on the outside full mesh in the
front so this is just like we're used to
seeing this is a bit of a tighter mesh
versus what we've seen in the past on
hundred series cases although it doesn't
look to me as though it's going to
restrict airflow in any meaningful way
we've got an end nice silver and black
an tech logo down here at the bottom and
it looks like you can actually move this
around should you so desire because it's
just on
five and a quarter inch cover all right
we've got a pretty traditional looking
100 series look so this looks just like
the 300 in terms of these ridges at the
front we've got our power switch no
reset switch microphone headphones power
as well as hard drive LEDs and we have
four front USB 2.0 so we don't have any
USB 3.0 on this case although that is to
be expected for a value chassis I'll go
ahead and stay stay where you are I'll
rotate the case so on the side we've got
an optional 120 millimeter fan mount and
then on the top we've actually got a
pre-populated 140 millimeter fan so
that's gonna provide a lot of
ventilation for the CPU area and then if
you do install a power-hungry and heat
generating GPU you can also install a
fan back there here we've got another
120 millimeter fan in the back and then
we also find a fairly standard layout
and the rest of the back of the case
although this is interesting look at
this okay so we've got our i/o shield
and then we've got one two three four
five six seven eight PCI slots so this
may be one of the best value cases on
the market that is capable of
accommodating some of those extended
motherboards that have more than seven
PCI slots that's kind of neat don't
forget - there is a use for this bottom
PCI slot sometimes even if your
motherboard does not have extra slots
for example be gigabyte x58 extreme re
x58 extreme whatever it was had a PCI
Express 16x slot at the very bottom so
if you wanted to run 3-way crossfire or
SLI you actually needed either an empty
space or an extra PCI slot at the very
bottom in order to install a dual slot
graphics card in that bottom one so
there you have it bottom mounted power
supply okay so standard ATX only we
don't have any support for an tex CPX
standard and we're gonna go ahead and
take these side panels off so ntek has
included thumb screws which is fortunate
because I left my screwdriver upstairs
okay we're gonna take out the side panel
there's a little bit of flex on the side
panel but you have to expect that on a
more value oriented case one of the
tricks that I've often used in the past
with thinner metal cases especially if
you run into a situation where the side
panel is vibrating or something like
that like you install a fan here and
some of that vibration gets transferred
to the side panel is you can actually
put little bits of blue sticky tack on
the inside of the panel where it
contacts the case and that can eliminate
any vibration so there's the other side
panel go ahead and take that off put it
and here is the inside of the case so
the first thing we find inside is a
survey of all things so you should go to
that URL should you so desire and then
yeah okay we've got some hardware so
there's some soft silicon silicon hard
drive mounting grommets as well as
screws and then we thought all the cases
we need for are the cases the screws we
need for mounting the motherboard in the
case and then he drives and all that
good stuff that we may require okay here
on the inside we've got a couple little
raised spots for the power supply to
mountain however looking at the overall
design of the case I'd say I'd recommend
mounting your power supply with the fan
up so that way you're going to make sure
you're getting enough air flow into your
fence some cases do have mesh here at
the bottom so that you can mount it fan
side down but I don't think I'd do that
in this particular case we've got one
two three four five six three and a half
inch bays although I can verify that if
I actually check that yeah we've got six
internal three and a half three external
five and a quarter inch base and then we
have one internal mounted 2.5 inch SSD
mounting base so actually you can see
that if I turn the case this way there
are our mounting points for installing
an SSD in the 100 it looks like we've
also got to front 120 millimeter fan
mounts so the way those are going to be
accessed is by pulling off the front
bezel if I can figure out how to do it
and I will gladly demonstrate for you
guys ok one two
there we are okay so we can pull off the
front bezel and from there it shouldn't
be too challenging to figure out how to
mount the fans although I can't quite
figure it out ah clips look at that okay
I think okay give me a moment
yeah it's that simple you just take your
fan you line it up in the right spot you
can clip it in just like that so that's
how you mount your fans and then you can
go ahead and install the front bezel
back on to your case being careful that
the wires are running into their correct
locations okay so that's pretty much
everything I wanted to show you guys
here at the front of the chassis so
let's just see okay the way that hooks
in is actually kind of neat so you can
swing it out so then you can make sure
everything hooks in correctly and then
it Clips then on this side so I think
that's pretty much everything there is
to say about it we've got a motherboard
motherboard tray cutout so you can
install and uninstall backplate
requiring CPU heat sinks without taking
your motherboard in or out of the case
so that's a pretty nice convenience
factor we've also bought a little bit of
cable management going on on the back
here so they've included a couple zip
ties as well as anchor points for a
couple more although most of the thicker
cables like your a pin and like your 24
pin may or may not be able to run up the
back of this motherboard tray kind of
hard to say that I'm thinking I'm
thinking maybe not you know what though
guys if anyone has a 100 please let me
know if you were able to run your 24 pin
and your 8 pin CPU power connector
behind the back of the motherboard so
