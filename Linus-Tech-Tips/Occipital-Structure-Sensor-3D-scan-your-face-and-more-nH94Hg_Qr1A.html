mobile 3d sensor that allows you to
capture dense geometry and high fidelity
3d models very quickly it has a mode
that allows you to capture an entire
room at once and it even lets you play
with some augmented reality games stay
tuned for more of that and hit the like
button down below if you want to see us
check out more 3d printers in the future
vote for turnip we always say on the
wine show by the shirt it's in the link
in the description down below so why the
structure sensor well I've been really
interested in 3d scanners and printers
for quite some time now but usually the
best option is like Shapeways or
whatever and it's kind of been under
that whole too expensive and not really
good enough for mainstream or me yet
category yes I know I'm a
virtual-reality nut but one or two VR
dev kits is nowhere near the cost of a
truly awesome 3d scanning and printing
setup let alone the cost of plastics the
structure sensor stood out to me however
and I decided that it's time to start
getting my hands dirty in the scanning
and printing space unlike most 3d
scanners the structure sensor isn't a
contained unit with a spinning platform
or a moving camera or whatever instead
it just straps to your iPad air one or
two iPad Mini two or three or fourth gen
iPad then plugged in through a lightning
connector to the iPad itself and the
internal battery of the structure sensor
is charged through power from your mains
not the expected microUSB solution
it's a depth sensor using an invisible
laser projective infrared blast and
infrared camera to capture and then in
conjunction with the iPads accelerometer
gyroscope and compass it can map out a
relatively accurate depth map that can
be put together into a point cloud and
finally modelled if that's what you want
these movement-based mechanics really
give you the freedom to scan some very
interesting objects that you may not be
able to put into a contained type
scanning unit may be the material shape
or actually just the material could be
the problem imagine scanning a sand
castle for most people this wouldn't be
very possible due to picking up said
sand castle and having it fall apart on
the way to the scanner but if you were
able to bring the scanner to the sand
castle then you got a different story so
3d scanning mapping entire rooms playing
argumented reality games and maybe some
more how well does it do it all let's
find out so this is just the object
scanner and you can use your thumbs to
resize how large the box is you don't
want it to be too small because then
I'll end up chopping off part of poor
Terrans head
and you don't want to be too large
because then I'll pick up stuff like the
chairs and the desks so I'm going to
guess it's around here I'll get some of
his shoulders in there and as you can
see it'll put kind of this this white
stuff on top of whatever it has in the
scan whatever data you'll get you can
notice already that it seems to be doing
a pretty good job but I don't have
Terrence glasses in here it doesn't pick
up glasses very well because it's clear
and the IR light isn't going to kind of
come back to the sensor very well off of
something that's clear when it goes red
like that I'm too close so I need to
kind of come back so I just moved too
quickly you might be able to see this on
the scanner
so it's recovering move gently I'm just
trying to patch in some various holes
that we have it's coming along quite
nicely actually so I'm gonna press stop
it's not that bad really
it is sometimes there's holes here yeah
there's holes there color view there's
your terror you know it's treated pretty
okay with the glasses a lot better than
I expected one thing that I want to
clarify before we do room scanning is
that it's kind of designed for an empty
rooms it's not designed for a super
crazy clutter really small room like
this so I'm putting it into a worst case
scenario and we'll see how it works and
here we go you'll see it's kind of fun
you kind of put everything in the room
into like Tron almost I'm going to let
it look at the inside so that I can see
that those are closet doors whoa that
looks funky I think I moved too much and
it - ow so it thinks that closet is just
insane all right let's try this again
I'm going to try to move less I'm going
to try to not move my position like it
all alright so you can see how much of a
better job it did there when it's given
something a little bit more simple it
even did a much better job of the closet
it still has a bit more depth than it
probably actually has I don't know
that's that's pretty accurate actually
now we can try a whole filling that
makes it even a little bit better
that definitely did fix some areas the
roof fan looks kind of insane on x-ray
view brah cool now let's try the last
one argumented reality so I give this
little cat and balls fall down and I
have to try to go get them but because I
scanned these objects in the cat can't
go through the mineral oil bottle as you
can see right there cannot go through
the mineral oil bottle but I can go
around it it's a rather simple game but
this is basically a dev kit so you can
go in here hack the game up make
whatever you kind of want and maybe make
something a little bit more fun than cat
chases ball around bottles of mineral
oil so that was fun but what about a
conclusion the structure sensor is cool
and it's definitely fun but how
practical was it well that actually
depends a lot on the operator and the
subject things that reflect or absorb a
crazy mount may actually cause you some
problems and a shaky and experienced or
impatient operator will result in issues
the fact that the platform isn't the
same all the time we'll leave you
needing to edit many of your scans in
relatively minor or sometimes relatively
major ways what I recommend it yes if
you need a free-form scanner for many
applications that it could be needed for
instead of a contained scanner yes if
you have want to have a ton of fun with
it not necessarily if you're looking for
the highest potential scanning
resolution and fidelity in the end
speaking of things Dollar Shave Club
Dollar Shave Club is a great way to get
razors and other bathroom supplies
shipped directly to your door for only a
few bucks a month the razors are
high-quality and we have a ton of
community members who use them every day
and love the smooth shape that they get
no matter how thick or coarse their
facial hair may be for some reason this
comes as a shock to many people out
there but yes even though I have facial
hair I do shave and I would definitely
say that I get a better shape from
Dollar Shave Club razors than those old
ones that I had the razors are pretty
darn nice and on top of that their
razors also come with dr. Carver's shave
butter which goes on smooth so you can
see what you're doing and they're
peppermint scented butt wipes for men
for those of you over here in North
America that can't get your hands on a
bidet so check out everything they have
to offer at dollarshaveclub.com slash
