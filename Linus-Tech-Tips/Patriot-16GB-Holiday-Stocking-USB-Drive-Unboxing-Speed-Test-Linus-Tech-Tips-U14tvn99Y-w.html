I've seen this before this is the
Patriot holiday tree and the Patriots no
person politically correct USB flash
drive so the holiday tree is for gig the
snowman is 8 gig and there's one that I
didn't have before and I didn't know I
was getting one shot the video already
but now we have the Patriot holiday
stalking so that is the 16 gig version
which I'm going to now unbox with its
two-year warranty and driverless support
for most operating systems Wow this is
like some serious business packaging
here that I must have used my knife on
last time that's ok am i nice it's Lex
trying to find a knife for me but he
doesn't realize that I'm just struggling
with it for effect here right now so why
don't we go ahead and find out the
performance of the 16 gig holiday
stocking which is like the other two
absolutely adorable and has a holiday
flake on it and holiday gifts so here
let's go over here well plug it in to
the front USB on my own tech 300 on the
this is the tech tips video editing PC
so go ahead close all this let's go
ahead and find something maybe on local
disk see I have actually no idea what's
what's on this computer anywhere
apparently there's desktops empty
downloads alright sure let's have a look
let's find like a large file somewhere
here's one aha
here's a here's an ISO so let's go ahead
and copy that so that's 716 makes hey
that's actually not bad for like a value
value USB Drive that looks super cute so
I'm gonna let you guys do the timing
because I forgot to set a timer to start
so you know you can just pay attention
to this number and then the total time
of the video and then I was dropping off
a little bit or maybe it's not I mean
this number is notoriously inaccurate
although not as bad as it was on
previous versions of Windows Slick's
nodding in agreement he's with me on
this one
notoriously inaccurate see how
complicated is that there's time and
megabytes and like I really I really
don't see why that's so difficult to to
figure out for file copy speed measuring
like if it was one of those things where
it's like you know time over megabay
megabytes over like the spaciality of
the computer and it was like this
complicated like three dimensional graph
then I think we're having a different
conversation here but this is like this
is basic stuff I mean even if it gave me
a summary at the end I'd be happy with
that if it was just like the whole thing
even though we were saying sixteen
megabytes the entire time actually it
went it's three megabytes per second
because we've been timing it this entire
time we're Microsoft and I'm just buying
time here guys so there we go the file
transfer is done I'm gonna go ahead and
hold my stocking and holiday stocking
out of the computer and I've lost the
cap but I wouldn't have lost the cap if
I had use the included cap holder which
you can use to throw the cap on there
and then attach this to this so the
whole thing stays chained together just
like that so thank you for checking out
