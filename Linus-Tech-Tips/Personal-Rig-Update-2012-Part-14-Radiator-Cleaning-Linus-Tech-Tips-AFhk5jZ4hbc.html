have made exactly zero progress over
here so I promise to show well I don't
remember if I promise to do this but I
should have promised you this at some
point because I was going to do it so I
wanted to show you guys the procedure
for cleaning out older radiators because
as you guys know if you've been watching
my personal rig updates my radiators are
not new this is a black ice pro 2 which
is the first radiator I ever bought for
my first water-cooled rig and then this
is a thermo chill PA one 20.4 which is a
bit of a rare item these days I think
there's probably rads that perform
better but this is a good fit for the G
jo7
and yeah the great rad there's really no
compelling reason to replace it there's
been some talk about what fans is line
is using I actually use two different
kinds of fans in my rig I'm using gelid
wings they are Gaillard wings and all
the places where they're visible so
those are UV blue fans and then on the
radiator down in the bottom the PA one
20.4 I'm actually using Silverstone air
penetrator 121 s so those were one of
the are are they 121 s pretty sure
they're 121 s whatever the first
directed airflow one so those are UV
blue as well but you'll never see them
because they're hiding in the bottom the
reason I was using these ones is because
they were the first I got them back when
they were the only directed airflow fan
so i rave on and on and on about the
Noctua n FF 12s those are similar to
these they're newer they're a little bit
better but they're directed airflow so
you get like a vortex of air that moves
away from the fan like this so that it
actually doesn't just kind of go all
over the place the reason for that is in
the basement of the TJ o7
here we go the white balance will be off
over here but there's not really a lot I
can do about that right now let's go
ahead and give you guys some more light
in the basement of the TJ of seven what
you're doing is you're pulling the air
in here and then what you ultimately
want it to do is go out the other side
not just get sort of sort out the other
side not just get dispersed around there
so that's why I went with those fans and
then gelid wings for the rest of it they
go there's the rest of the Gilad wings I
went with those because at the time of
buying them
gelid wings were one of the only
good-looking good performing fans that
came in all the fan sizes that I needed
so Noctua had fans but their 92
millimeter fan was not a pressure
optimized fan it was an airflow
optimized fan it was with that really
really uh
like highly angled I never blade design
that I really didn't like and didn't
really believe in that much alright so
what am I doing here
vinegar for one thing so a 10% vinegar
and hot water mixture went into the loop
now most people just flush the radiators
by putting some some some water and
vinegar inside them plugging them up
shaking them up and then sort of doing
sort of less more and more diluted until
you're doing a couple flushes with
distilled water in order to make sure
they're all clean I knew mine were
particularly gunked-up you can actually
see the water is blue so I left it here
for about an hour actually running so I
have a pump going here here's an ax 850
running the pump for me not something to
watch out for guys if you don't have
quite as much radiator in your test
configuration the pump can actually heat
up the water to the point where it can
overheat so make sure that you actually
turn one of the one or two of the fans
on just to make sure that it doesn't
overdo it with six dot by one twenty
millimeter radiators though there's
enough passive cooling that I don't
really have that issue so what I'm going
to do now this is my 10% is I'm going to
do a 5%
I mean approximately 5% I don't know
exactly how much water's in there but it
doesn't really matter so I'm going to do
a 5% mixture then I'm going to do two or
three rounds of just distilled water to
get the rads as clean as I can so thank
you for checking out this personal rig
update where it's basically me yammering
about nothing and then finally in the
last couple of minutes telling you what
I'm actually doing and once this is done
I'll be ready to put the rads back in
the system which is one of the reasons
why I haven't been able to install
anything else because I need to route
all the power to my fans and I need to
get those Reds in before I can put all
the front panel Bay covers seeing the
rigs over there front panel Bay covers
and stuff like that so don't forget to
