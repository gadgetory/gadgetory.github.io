is the first quantum dot display that I
have yet had the pleasure of putting my
grubby little hands on but does it
deliver or does it disappoint
let's start with the monitor itself the
276 II features only what I would
consider the basic inputs VGA DVI and
HDMI with no DisplayPort it resorts to
an external power brick something I
don't usually mind personally though I
wish the cord was a little longer on
this one so it reached the floor more
comfortably but is considered a design
compromise by many it has no creature
comforts to speak of so no USB hub and
it not only lacks any ergonomic
adjustments other than tilt in its
admittedly attractive though metal base
but to add insult to injury does not
feature vase amount points so other than
putting a riser or some books under it
on your desk nothing can be done to
adjust the height the bezels are of
average thickness so no complaints there
but while some people may be into white
monitors to go with their oh I don't
know 2006 model MacBook or whatever the
use of glossy plastic anywhere that we
might have to look at it is a pretty
sore spot for me as are the touch
sensitive buttons on the bottom right
for what must be the worst on-screen
menu controls that I have yet
encountered while it's true that they
are at least labeled unlike the genius
ones on a Search Predator X 34 and the
contextually switching ones that force
me to navigate deep within the menu just
to change a bloody input on this BenQ
the labels do be very little good when
they are positioned in such a way that I
need to lie my head down on the desk to
see them PSA to monitor makers all of
them not just Phillips here glossy
plastic is bad tactile feedback and
labels we can read on navigation buttons
are good okay Linus cool story bro but
the reason I'm still watching is that I
want to know if quantum dot which by the
way is actually as cool as it sounds and
involves a sealed tube with these dots
that react to blue light by shining red
and green learn more here is enough to
make this puppy worth any of the
compromises that you might be making by
buying it and for you my friend I will
reveal the answer
it depends on who you are and what you
want to do because a quantum dot monitor
much like all the buzz and marketing
nonsense around LED monitors is still at
its heart an LCD monitor it inherits
many of the same characteristics that
you would expect from any LCD in this
case the unexceptional black levels of
our IPS ABS panel make dark scenes look
more gray than black and while casual
gamers won't notice the difference it's
pixel response times are nothing to
write home about for competitive gamers
but what you get in return is the as
advertised wide color gamut support in
the form of true 99% coverage of the
Adobe RGB color space this in spite of
the unexceptional out of the box color
accuracy is a huge boon for digital
imaging hobbyists and prosumers who will
be super amped to have the ability to
work on photographs that they've taken
in Adobe RGB mode on their camera
natively on their workstation to get the
best possible printing results at an
unheard-of price point the 270 60 even
alongside a decent color image for
calibration is still going to be
fighting in a much lower price class
than other monitors with similar color
space support but that doesn't make the
270 60 a slam-dunk and I have one more
major issue with it the way it's
presented in the marketing materials and
in the reviewers guide as more vibrant
thanks to its ability to represent a
wider range of colors is really
irresponsible as far as I'm able to tell
unless you color calibrate it and set up
an ICC profile to correct this native
Adobe RGB monitor to the smaller sRGB
color space which is used almost
exclusively on the web and the PC you're
going to end up with inaccurate
oversaturated colors think of it this
way a program like let's say your web
browser will call for 100% green
assuming a fully srgb
pipeline then the monitor is going to go
to town delivering a 100% Adobe RGB
green that the program had no idea that
it could display compounding the issue
is the fact that even profiling is not a
perfect solution while Mac OS handles
color Corrections pixel-by-pixel
system-wide on Windows it's handled on
an application by application basis with
many common programs like games for
example not being ICC aware
so using this monitor you're going to
end up with TV display model syndrome
where your saturation is too high in a
way that might make it look punchy next
to a competitor on a shelf but actually
displays the content in a way that the
Creator did not intend most monitors
literally every single one that I've
ever seen with wide gamut support deal
with this simply by having an sRGB mode
often with a quick switch button within
the on-screen display but for some
reason the 276 EES doesn't work properly
I got the exact same 99% Adobe RGB
coverage in srgb mode and Phillips's
responds telling me that the
oversaturated greens were probably
because I'm not used to wide gamut
displays demonstrates that while at
least I don't believe they are
intentionally misleading customers they
also don't seem to really understand the
issue here which leads us finally to a
couple of conclusions number one is that
whether this monitor is for you or not
wide gamut support is coming to the
mainstream thanks to quantum dot whoo
freakin hoo at this kind of pricing I'd
be surprised if every LCD doesn't
support it in a couple years time what a
cool technological advance to tide us
over while we wait for OLED to deal with
its burnin and cost issues and this is
conclusion number two we all need to
practice new technology use responsibly
it's all fine and good to be ahead of
the feature curve but it's important not
to lose track of the way that most
people will use the product in the
process I'm not saying that the 276 E is
a total flop of a product
but in my humble opinion it is best
suited for use as a secondary display
for a hobbyist
or a prosumer photo editor for example
where icc aware applications can be
dragged over to it but other
applications like games can be run on
one with proper standard sRGB color
space support
speaking of which audible.com audible is
the leading supplier of audiobooks with
literally hundreds of thousands of
downloadable titles across all types of
literature we're talking fiction
nonfiction periodicals you name it
audiobooks are great to listen to when
you are I don't know driving stuck in
traffic if you're well okay I hate to
say this because you probably shouldn't
have been doing that but if you're the
forklift operator at my old job say for
example when you're doing chores around
the house at the gym or wherever you
happen to be well that's a great time to
catch up on your reading and for our
audience members audible is offering a

tips to get away from life tips
including the entire Harry Potter series
