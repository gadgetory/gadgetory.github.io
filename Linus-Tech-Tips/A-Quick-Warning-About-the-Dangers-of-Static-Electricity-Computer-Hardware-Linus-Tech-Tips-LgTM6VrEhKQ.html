static electricity I'm not sure if you
guys heard that zap but basically this
is what happens to me especially in the
winter when it's dry when the air is dry
every time I walk away from my desk in
my awesome winter boots with the static
magnet fur inside them so this is just a
quick warning about handling computer
equipment and this is what I have done
actually at my own desk to negate the
effects of this because I've actually
been zapped so hard by my mouse wheel
that I've had my mouse turn off my
keyboard that my nose has turned into
turned off and then it takes about a
minute to turn back on
so before you handle any sensitive piece
of computer gear or in my case a bloody
mouse you should touch a plugged in
power supply in order to get the static
charge to ground out that was pretty
much it you can go ahead and stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
