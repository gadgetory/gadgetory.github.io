and I hope you guys agree this will be
my own or my knife is there it is
this will be my unboxing and first look
at the Radeon HD 7950 from sapphire now
there's something a little bit special
about this particular HD 7950 from
sapphire and that is that in addition to
being a non reference design so that is
to say it comes on a non reference PCB
which we've come to expect from 79 50s
it also has a non-reference cooler and
it is overclocked so it's a three gig
card has support for their tricks tweak
and overclock utility for sapphire
graphics cards it comes with an HDMI
cable okay so this is all very
interesting there's a lot of stuff here
but we're going to cover most of this
when we get a little bit further in so
much like the Radeon HD here we go 79 70
so this is an OEM card with the
completely um yeah dollas anything
reference cooler reference PCB so unlike
our similarly to the 7970 it uses the
Tahiti core so that is a 28 nanometer
GPU and the difference is that it has
slightly fewer functional units than the
7970 and in its default configuration
anyway it is clocked a little bit lower
both of these graphics cards have three
gigs of memory and they're using the
latest 28 nanometer manufacturing
process in order to achieve outstanding
performance with really what is was
previously thought to be completely
unbelievable power consumption not
unbelievable in the bad way unbelievable
the good way we're not talking like you
know GTX 480 here we're talking like
seems like it could be like a 2600 Pro
in terms of the power consumption at
idle but it is actually a full-fledged
gaming card so inside the box we find
the driver installation disk we find a
quick installation guide we find a
product registration card probably a
good idea to use that okay crossfire
bridge
wot's Wow all the stuff comes with lots
of stuff so we've got to 8-pin - oh no
we have them - molex - PCIe 6 pin
adapters there's the 1 point 8 meter
HDMI cable that they claimed was
included and I have now validated and is
actually included we also get a mini
DisplayPort to display for an adapter a
HDMI to DVI adapter although it should
be noted that this will only work for
single-link DVI so that is up to 1920 by
1200 at 60 Hertz because you are still
relying on the HDMI port which is only
single link we've also got a DVI to VGA
adapter so we can go ahead and throw all
of these back in here and let's have a
look at the card itself so yes I have
all these other cards over here and I'm
definitely I'm definitely getting to
that that's going to be more of a more
of a size comparison thing than anything
else there we go wow that's actually a
gorgeous looking part so here we have in
the Sapphire HD 7950 it has dual 92
millimeter cooling fans on a very very
robust looking cooler so check this out
we've got dual thick heat pipes and then
triple thinner heat pipes all of them
are taking heat away from the GPU core
itself but you can actually see right
there from the GPU core itself as far
away as possible to the aluminum fins
that are cooling it so what you'll
notice is that they use the thicker heat
pipes for the greater distances in order
to make sure that we're carrying heat
effectively away even over here so that
this fan actually has heat to carry away
from the metal in order to cool the GPU
itself it uses a very very open design
so you can see as I turn it around the
fans airflow is not impeded pretty much
in any way by a shroud or any other
characteristics of the cooler itself so
it's got a plastic shroud right here and
then it's see that free air flow coming
from the fans down out around the GPU
what this means is a couple of things so
one it means that heat is being expelled
into your case so if you
don't have a decent case that you know
has intake fans and exhaust fans if
you're using like a crummy sort of mini
Tower or something like that you might
not prefer a card like this you might
prefer one that sticks with a more
reference design which is an external
exhaust blower fan like that however if
you do have a decent case these are
usually much more effective than those
referenced coolers at removing heat from
the GPU the memory in the vrm and at the
cost that you do expel some of the heat
into your case so yeah something to
consider
what are you actually speaking of erm
what are we doing for vrm cooling oh
this is kind of smart check this up so
they've got the the usual sort of GPU
cooling thing going on here but then
they've also added a heat spreader so
you see this black piece right here that
goes pretty much all the way around and
wraps up here around the top so that's
covering up all the memory modules all
three gigs of memory are actually
located you can see the positions of
them are located on this side of the PCB
some of the other vrm components are not
covered by a heatsink but they do have
direct airflow from a fan coming down on
them from the top so I've right I was
saying advantages and drawbacks of these
coolers right so they tend to be cooler
and quieter than reference coolers but
the drawback is that they do exhaust the
heat into your case so just make sure
you got a decent case or like me no case
that is another solution okay so what
other characteristics here so you saw
the two included molex to 6-pin pci ii
adapters that's because this card
requires two PCI Express six pen
adapters you can see on it actually this
is kind of interesting yeah so this is a
completely non reference card okay you
can see on it that there was room for an
eight pin adapter here but they did not
deem that to be necessary remember the
tahiti pro so that's the 7950 does not
require as much power as the 7970 in
terms of output options these are very
similar to what we're used to seeing on
these cards it does support up to four
display I finna T so that is DVI HDMI
and two mini display ports right here
and on the back I guess
not much else to say about it now why do
I have all these cards here right let's
get to that this is an overclocked card
so what I want to find out because I've
never actually taken a look at a not
overclocked actually this is more like
this yeah there we go I've never
actually taken a look at a non
overclocked 7950 so one of the things I
tried to do tonight was flash my 7970
reference card with a 7950 bios to see
if i could actually turn off some of the
shaders so that i could compare this
against like a fully referenced 7950 but
i'm not able to do that unfortunately it
just turns down the clock speed it
doesn't turn down the shaders so what
I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be
taking this overclocked version of the
card and I'm going to see how it
compares against a itself at stock clock
speed so I'll just turn dial them back
to reference clocks using the included
overclocking utility which can also be
used for under clocking and then I also
want to compare it against a wide
variety of other cards so here I have a
69.95 90 I have a 79 70 GTX 580 I have
the 79 50 which will be OC and not OC
but it'll be the same card I'm just
going to change the clock speeds I have
a GTX 570 and I have a 69 70 / 69 50 so
I use the bios switch in order to switch
this card between those two different
biases because this one can be locked
and unlocked so stay tuned on Linus tech
tips from a closer look at this card
we're also going to profile the overall
noise and heat characteristics of it and
