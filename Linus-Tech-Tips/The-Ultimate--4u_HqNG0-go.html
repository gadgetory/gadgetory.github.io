2017 possible for us this year check
them out in the link below so you guys
have probably heard of FLIR thermal
imaging not only have we done videos on
them but they've been in like the news
they do stuff for military and police
applications they make consumer products
they do a ton of stuff they're basically
the name in thermal imaging as far as I
know but you probably haven't seen this
this is the FLIR duo it's basically a
FLIR camera in like GoPro form so you
can attach it to a drone it's cameras
capable of 1080p multi spectral imaging
which is how you get clear crisp images
where you can actually see the details
of things like say a dog's face but
still get the thermal information on top
the unit itself has a Bluetooth button
on the left-hand side that allows you to
control it through a phone or a laptop
or something like that a record button
on top and then on the right-hand side
there's a USB port which needs to be
used for power as there's no battery
onboard which makes sense because they
fit two cameras into this thing then
behind that there's an micro SD card
slot for video storage or a picture
storage and above that there's an HDMI
port which means that you can push out
to something like a screen which is
actually pretty cool if you didn't want
to attach this to a drone and wanted to
set it up as maybe a surveillance camera
or something like that what's also cool
is that it's available now but I can't
actually show you the results of this
thing working because they don't have
the right cable or something which is
rather unfortunate what I can show you
is the FLIR one Pro which is this guy
but it's named the same as the previous
one this is the third generation what
isn't about it is its specs and its
capability it's a 2 megapixel camera
which is doesn't sound that great but
when you're in thermal imaging is
actually rather good it's a USB type-c
port on the top which can actually be
raised or lowered through a radio dial
which is actually pretty cool they had a
lot of requests for this because of
people on construction sites or just
people in general who had thick-bodied
cases on their phones now they can raise
the USB port up and get it to fit up in
there without actually taking their case
off which is nice you can control up to
310 points at once so you can click at
three different places on the screen it
can measure the temperature at those
places or you can drag and move them
around and measure whatever you want and
it comes with vivid IR which is a new
technology that they're using which
should give you a cleaner crisper easier
to make sense of image it's also up well
drop rated for 1.8 meters which is good
but it does cost a little bit it's $399
that being said though it's the pro
version you can also get the consumer
version if you want which cost 199
dollars doesn't have quite as many
features like not actually going to drop
it it's not drop rated for like anything
it has 110 point on the screen not 3 it
doesn't have vivid IR so the images
aren't quite clean and crisp and you
don't have access to the FLIR tools app
so you can't do anything advanced beyond
that if neither of those float your boat
we have a different device this
all-in-one contained unit called the
FLIR c3
it has an extremely rugged package and
is designed for construction sites it
even has a hook so you can put it on
your keys or a lanyard or something like
that
but there is a trade off the sensor
isn't quite as nice and the thermal
range isn't as wide either but they did
tell me when I asked about that that if
you see a temperature that's over 150
degrees on a construction site you might
have other problems it can store 2,000
photos but unfortunately can't take
videos although oddly enough it has
Wi-Fi and you can stream with it so
that's what's new from FLIR I wish I
could show you actual footage from the
FLIR duo but we'll probably get one of
those in office at some point I love
FLIR stuff I'm happy that they're coming
up with new generation things I do
appreciate that every single time that
they come out with a new FLIR one their
consumer end one becomes cheaper I think
that's pretty cool if you've ever
thought about getting into thermal
imaging check out FLIR it's actually
solid stuff and if you want to check out
something else cool before you leave
check out D branch I've got them on all
my stuff I think I showed off the back
of my phone for like almost every single
D brand integration so far but whatever
man we also use them on our laptops
which I've also called out in every
single D brand integration so far so
you're probably used to it by now but
whatever if you're tired of seeing my
skins check out the configurator down
below and make your own I'll see you
guys next time go to the D brand link
down below bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
