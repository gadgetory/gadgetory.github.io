you have to ask the question how many
case fans do I need
how many case fans can this case even
take where should I put them what types
should I get how many are going to be
worth it do I make compromises into
other components in order to get these
case fans it's kind of annoying and
there isn't a ton of clear answers out
there so we're going to check that out
today also like the video if you want to
see a bunch of build logs based around
gaming feeds
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
click now to learn more loads of people
freaked out over their fans and I mean I
get it it kind of feels like a manual
warranty you want your parts to stay
cool you just spent a whole bunch of
money on this fancy new rig you don't
want to overheat and die
it's freaky I get it but what's the
golden rule what's the sweet spot
honestly I don't know but that's what
we're here today to find out you and I
are going to pick a bunch of components
put them all in a case and test a whole
bunch of different configurations of
fans to figure out what you need so
let's go so all my personal Twitter Luke
underscore la Fri posted a bunch of
straw polls asking people what they had
in their systems in terms of CPU cooler
fans case and graphics card in terms of
graphics card you guys told me that you
had an internal exhaust cool to graphics
card so I grabbed a 290 that I've had
for a little bit here that has internal
exhaust so that should represent that
type of heat going into your case in
terms of CPU cooler you guys said an
average like single tower cooler so I
have a hyper t4 I don't have a hyper 212
evo because I still don't know but this
will be a pretty good representative of
that motherboard CPU and RAM all don't
really matter that much but I've got AZ
170 series deluxe board here from a soos
some random RAM from a data and a 6700 K
that we'll use to kind of heat things up
in terms of fans you guys said mid-range
so I grabbed some an tech try cools here
so I'm just random once I was actually
going to go with cooler master because
we have somewhat of a theme going on
which you'll see here in a moment this
is not a cooler mastered sponsored build
by the way but a master case because you
guys said about 90 to 150 dollars is
what you'd spend on your case and this
can fall somewhere in there depending on
what configuration you get we had a
cooler master cooler already so is going
to go with cooler master fans but the
spare cooler master fans that we have in
the office on Newegg are $69 when
they're like almost 50% off so there's
some pricing error going on there and
how much they're actually worth so I
just got some random Antec ones so here
we go let's build the system put fans
all over place see how it turns out so
I'm taking the cooler master fans that
are already in the case out which is a
little bit silly because I'm going to
have to put them back in eventually but
the first test that I want to do is
actually going to be just with the hyper
tee for running because I want to see
how effective a case is with no fans
additional at all because I think that's
wow not entirely representative because
your case will basically always come
with some amount of fans still an
interesting question that we should
answer I'm going to stall the tee for
out of the case because it's not the
easiest thing to install and it's going
to be a constant in this build so if I
just put it on it's fine
so the back plate for the t4 is just
missing so I don't have an option really
there but I grab the NEFT into ATL and
got the back plate from that like the
screws are actually compatible so I
don't know I'm gonna go this direction I
don't know if it's going to work but I
kind of really need to use this t4 so
okay I can figure something out
holy crap it works thank you to ATL all
right okay so we're gonna be able to use
the hyper t4 and moving on so there's a
lot of variables here and I honestly
can't answer them all unfortunately one
of them being the power supply you could
have it so the power supplies pulling
air from the inside of the case or you
could have it so it's in a basement like
in this situation or you could have it
so that it's pulling air from the
outside and then spitting out the back
in its own little ecosystem which is
also like this situation I went with the
power supply not really contributing
because I actually wanted to remove it
as a variable there's no way like I just
said that I can do all the different
possible scenarios we'd need an insane
amount of cases different fans all that
kind of stuff so I'm trying to take a
very average use case and I think either
in a basement or not contributing to the
system's cooling it's probably more
common okay so most of the way done
building the case not a hundred cent but
most of the way so per monitor keyboard
a mouse so we can check things out I'm
going to install the graphics card real
quick and then we're going to start our
first test
all right graphics card is in currently
we have only one fan and it's on the
hyper t4 I'm going to turn the system on
by turning the power supply on first and
then turning the power button on the
motherboard
alright that's booting up I'm going to
get the panels on it then we're ready to
test my boot device isn't working
nope yeah there's another blue screen so
I'll have to find another drive damn
alright so we are currently running our
first test this is with the system
closed with only the t4 running I am
running I 264 stress test and I'm
running fur mark on our 290 so that is
only one fan I have taken the fans out
of the front of the case there is no
fans in the top which I can even show
you right now there are no fans in the
top there are no fans there is no fan
sorry in the back nothing we're just
testing with just the t4 right now the
CPU is only at about 71 degrees Celsius
which is actually pretty impressive but
skylake doesn't run that hot so I'm not
too surprised the 290 however is at 92
degrees Celsius but at the same time
we're slamming it with fir bark and a
290 is kind of a hot card so I'm not too
surprised I'm installing one fan in the
front here and I'm going to install one
fan in the back I think this is a pretty
common kind of bare-bones fan setup
where the the case manufacturer will
give you one one kind of in the middle
of the front and one in the back we're
giving them benefit of doubt and putting
in 140 millimeter fans which are a
little bit more common these days also
took out the hard drive cage that was
sitting right here because a there's a
hard drive cage down here and a lot of
people are opting for like just SSD rigs
or just one hard drive where you could
probably get it out of the way of the
graphics card and that hard drive cage
was in the way of the graphics card so
we're gonna give it the benefit out
there as well
Wow ok we'll see what it's obviously
like when it's done heating up but it
looks like a huge improvement already
okay so it's been ten minutes with the
one fan in the front one fan in the back
the CPU is running at about sixty
degrees which is down from 71 with just
the T for running and the GPU is running
at 79 degrees which is down from 92 so
just adding one fan in the front and one
fan in the back was actually a pretty
huge improvement but we haven't really
gotten to the point where you're
actually adding fans to the system yet
because this is a very common stock
setup one fan of the front one fan in
the back is usually what you're going to
kind of get in terms of fans in your
system is two that come in the case is
actually very common I don't know if
that's usual but at least two in the
case it's very common all right so now
we're running two fans in the front one
friend in the back no fans in the top
and this is our third test so far we've
seen some pretty significant
improvements from our first test to our
second test we're going to see how much
this makes a difference I can already
tell it won't be making nearly as much
of a difference but it does seem to be a
little bit better but we do need to let
it sit for 10 minutes okay so it's been
10 minutes this is again with two fans
in the front one fan in the back we've
got a CPU temp of about 57 degrees I'm
going to say 58 degrees looks like a
better average there I'm taking the
second highest number on real temp so
we'll take 58 degrees and a GPU
temperature of 77 which means we went
down to four CPU and we went down to
four GPU which is not a huge improvement
but very noticeable two degrees in both
categories is definitely very noticeable
so we're going to move on put one fan in
the back of the top and we'll see how
well that does so this is getting to the
realm of you might have added a fan or
two to your system possibly alright so
it's been ten more minutes our CPU
temperature is about 55 degrees so
that's down 3 I believe from our
previous number and our GPU temperature
is 76 which is actually only down one
degree from our previous temperature not
that surprising giving the position of
the fan alright so with all the fans
lots filled we're still running at
fifty-five degrees Celsius on the CPU
and we are still running at 76 degrees
on the GPU so there's actually no
thermal change by adding the last fan
which is actually pretty interesting and
might save some people some money
although that is fairly specific to this
set up but yeah diminishing returns was
the point I think we found it okay so
one of our extra tests is the t4 and
just one fan in the back of the case I
just kind of wanted to see how much of
an impact just that back case van did
okay so we're done testing just the one
in the back for CPU we got 64 degrees
and for GPU we got 85 degrees which is
pretty good but I'm very interested to
see how it compares to the one in the
front so let's swap the fan position and
move on forward okay so I just finished
testing with only one fan in the front
I'm now taking that fan out Blanche is
coming up soon and I don't want to be
late like we always are so I'm trying to
go quickly but with just one fan in the
front it got 67 degrees on the CPU and
eighty degrees on the GPU meaning that
it went up by three degrees for CPU but
it went down by five for GPU which is
interesting so you get a trade-off
depending on where you want to put your
fan may be something to take note of I'm
going to shove this fan at the top where
see how it goes alright so our last test
no fans in the front no fans in the back
one fan of the t4 one fan in the top
gave us 65 degrees on the CPU and 83
degrees on the GPU which lands it kind
of right in the middle of having one in
the back and one in the front which is
surprisingly perfect in my opinion so in
conclusion as we probably knew there are
diminishing returns when it comes to
adding fancier system although
surprisingly enough in my opinion once
you kind of get past the stock amount of
fans that come with your case it doesn't
really end up helping that much anymore
one of the most interesting parts to me
was actually when we started putting
single fans in different positions in
the case because that showed how much
different areas actually affected
different parts of your system as you
can kind of see here I need to get ready
for a way
encho and i stole a whole bunch of the
like monitor keyboard and mouse and
stuff from the wine show set so nick is
gonna take those and go work on the land
show set but yeah i hope you guys
enjoyed the video it was an interesting
look at what case fans kind of do and
affect in your system tunnel bear is the
