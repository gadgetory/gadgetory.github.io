learn more welcome to my unboxing of the
be quiet power zone power supply this
particular one is 650 watt although it's
available in a variety of wattages and
what is the point of the power zone line
you might ask well to deliver what would
traditionally be very premium features
such as their silent wings fan so very
quiet cooling as well as a fully modular
interface 80 plus bronze certification
for its efficiency and all that noise to
a well a more reasonable price point so
let's go ahead and start opening this
baby up a lot of their branding for this
power supply has to do with zones so the
performance zone they're using DC to DC
conversion and a single 12 volt rail
cooling zone you can actually cool up to
three different parts of your case using
the thermal control on the power supply
with a built-in extension lead which i
think is pretty darn cool connection
zone so full cable management or
modularity quiet zone so it has one
hundred and thirty five-millimeter
silent wings fan green zone so 80 plus
bronze which is not that exceptional
these days i mean come on and safety
zone so of course it has the full suite
of protections which you shouldn't take
for granted to be perfectly honest many
power supplies even if they say they
have them don't necessarily have them
implemented correctly and finally
quality the capacitors internally are
rated for operation at 105 degrees which
means that if they're operating at lower
temperatures than that which they will
unless you live in the desert and you
have your heat on in the house then the
power supply will last for a very long
time
and now that we've got it opened up we
can have a look at what be acquired
includes with the unit so you've got
your user's manual which tells you what
other products you could have bought or
by I mean they're just reusing the
user's manual for different you know
products you've also got a little sleeve
that you will never put your power
supply back in ever because who would do
that but you can use it for other
handy-dandy little things like you know
I don't know tools or whatever else I
hold onto these they're extremely useful
you've got some cable ties as well as
screws these are longer extended screws
which will become apparent why you need
those in just a moment as well as the
full complement of modular cable
don't worry they will include whatever
is the actual appropriate power cord for
your region for you the only reason I
got a European one is because I got this
sample directly from be quiet
so let's start with the PSU itself over
here we've got that one hundred
thirty-five millimeter cooling fan on
the bottom as well as their very unique
aesthetics so it's a powder coat finish
grille that instead of having a you know
a circular shape to door whatever else
just has a very straight shape and I
personally find looks quite striking
it's similar to what they have even on
their higher-end units like the dark
Power Pro they've also got to be quiet
logo that has that filled in sort of
shiny color resin thing going on with it
looks quite nice as well so this is the
side that you would normally see from
this angle when it's installed in your
case or you could flip it over the other
way and you can see all the safety
certifications and all that speaking of
safety certifications like I said before
six hundred and forty eight watts of the
six hundred and fifty watts it can pump
out can all be done on the 12 volt rail
and it is a single 12 volt rail so
you're not going to have to worry about
accidentally plugging something into the
wrong thing and accidentally triggering
the overcurrent protection on the back
of the unit you find again sort of a bit
of a different aesthetic and that's the
reason why you need those slightly
longer screws I personally don't prefer
this approach I would have liked to see
the power supply just be you know a
fraction of a centimeter shorter and
just use standard screws because this
isn't rubber it's plastic so I don't
imagine that it's going to reduce the
vibration that will be transferred to
the case by the fan inside which would
have maybe been the intention on the
side we find their power zone branding
as well as a stamped texture that I
think looks quite nice as well without
being over the top I mean I think the
last power supply I saw with black and
orange cables had black orange and white
and had like that like an outlandish
orange and silver colour scheme on it
and that I didn't find as tasteful as
something like this
so now let's head on to the business end
of the power supply you've got two spots
where you plug in the twenty pin or
however many pins that is it's a split
connector for the 24 pin as well as up
to three PCI Express cables that can be
plugged in to eight pin connectors can
be plugged in with a four auxilary
connector so that's molex or SATA and
finally there's those three fan leads
that you can use to control separate
fans with the fan controller that's
built into the
power supply one feature that it does
have although I personally don't see
much of the value to it is that it can
keep your fan spinning even once your
power supply is turned off so that are
not once your power supplies turned off
once your PC is turned off so that
components will cool down even after
you've shut down but when they're not
running there's really no danger of
damage to the components so I personally
don't worry about that too much but it
can be useful for is hardcore
benchmarking where you want to keep the
fans going to not have any of the
sub-zero coolants cause you know
condensation on the components or
anything like that once it's turned off
and it's not generating any heat anymore
then you can use those fans to blow it
away so there's something it could be
used for although I don't know how many
hardcore bench markers are going to be
using power zones compared to dark power
pros or something a little bit higher
end so what you might notice now that we
have all of the cables plugged into the
power supply is there are actually still
empty ports left so we have one
peripheral one open we have one PCI
Express one open and we have one of
those eight pin CPU connectors open this
is interesting to me because be quiet
includes actually more ports than you
need and fewer cables than fits in it
and I understand why this is only a 650
watt power supply each of those PCI
Express connectors supports two six plus
two pins so that means you can run two
graphics cards natively off of this
power supply an SLI or crossfire but you
shouldn't be running three so even
though it had three connector spots W
did you shouldn't be doing that so they
just include two cables so okay I get
that and then same thing goes for the
eight pin so you've just got a single
eight pin reasonably long cable on here
I like that you're going to be able to
reach in almost any case with that it's
a it's a four plus four you probably
shouldn't be using a 650 watt power
supply and any kind of rig that would
require two eight pins and three PCIe
eight pins so there you go okay so I
kind of look at that I go okay that's
interesting you've got your 24 pin
connector which is about average length
which is good because when this one's
too long it can just be a cable
management mess and then this is the one
where I sort of scratch them actually
notice both this first so next up we've
got those custom cables where you can
plug them into the power supply and then
those will lead to either molex if you
prefer or to a three pin
small fan connector if you would prefer
that totally up to you just make sure
guys that you don't plug
this molex into something that isn't a
fancy is clearly labeled ban because it
only has 12 volt power it doesn't
actually have an additional ground in
five volt power so you don't want to
risk damaging anything next this is the
one that made me scratch my head a
little bit they only include three
peripheral or drive connector harnesses
so one of them is pure SATA 4 SATA
connectors that's good because that you
can run over to your drive cages next up
they've got this is something they get a
be quiet does actually quite a good job
of is sensible arrangements of the
connectors on their cables so this one
is two SATA and I would have preferred
to see SATA maybe a little bit further
away from the power supply itself here
because your drive cages are sometimes a
bit of a distance and then to 4-pin
molex is and then another one to match
that except it also adds an additional
floppy so I would have liked to see one
more cable included but if you're not
going to plug in more than I guess eight
you know drives and four auxilary things
plus a floppy connector then I guess
it's not really a huge issue for you and
I guess with a 650 watt power supply you
probably shouldn't I just like the way
that with a lot of their units they give
you a lot of options in terms of the
cables you can connect but of course you
have to make compromises on the more
value oriented products and the fact
that you're getting full modularity and
all those other great features makes it
pretty compelling thank you for checking
