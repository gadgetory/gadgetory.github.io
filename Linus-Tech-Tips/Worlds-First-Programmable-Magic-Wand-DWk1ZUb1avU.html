other literally because thanks to kennel
sponsoring this video I will be the
first person in the world who gets to
cover the Harry Potter canno
coding kit in their own words you will
build a wand for yourself learn to code
and you will yes this is a direct quote
from the packaging wave your coding wand
let's find out how that works
okay so the software is currently
pre-release for this so I've gone ahead
and I've assembled an entire array of
every device that the final product will
support so I've got a OS Android Mac OS
and Windows but I'm gonna go ahead and
as much as this is gonna be a struggle
for me I'm gonna use the Mac OS version
of it because that's apparently the one
that is the most complete right now so
we're not gonna be having the entire
experience because it's not done I mean
there is no entire experience because
you can like I've actually got some
experience with the original kanno
computer kit I built it with my son and
he's actually used it quite a bit since
then and there's not really like there's
not like it like add beat the boss and
it's over type thing like it's more of a
learning product but we aren't gonna
have even the entire pre-canned
experience because it's not quite done
yet so so this is it come on over here
Ollivander would be proud how to make a
wand the handbook go ahead and put that
there look at this they got like a
little thing okay alright so um snap
click swish swish
I haven't watched the movies in a while
but I'm still getting I'm still getting
the references here oh wow there is a
spell guide stupefy Wingardium Leviosa
it's Leviosa not Leviosa I know letti oh
so not Leviosa I'm sorry I know I know
Lumos so these are some of the gestures
that you can do quick guide to one
motions I totally I totally want this
poster like regardless of the product I
like actually would just buy this poster
ah what else we got here okay we could
look at the instructions ooh that's
that's a construction book this is your
wand it's made of plastic rubber copper
and electronics
okay got your wand tip got a lanyard so
you don't throw it into the TV one
handle one brain button and to triple-a
batteries let's build your wand pick up
this piece they really do make this
stuff simple that was something that I
thought they did a great job of when I
built the cow no computer kit with my
son I mean even he was able to do it he
wasn't even 6:00 yet okay pick up this
piece count it it's called a printed
circuit board or PCB look closely at the
parts well that's fun so there's your
power controller so charging must come
in somewhere near there but I don't
actually see it here's our processor
here's an activity light of some sort
here's our codable vibration motor oh
cool there's hydration feedback so the
Bluetooth antenna this is fun actually
this is cool so a lot of people think
that devices that don't have external
antennas don't necessarily have antennas
but what they actually are is they're
generally copper on printed circuit
board so you can see in order to make
the antenna longer than it would
otherwise be able to be they've gone and
they've snaked it like this
neat right learn something every day
here's some sensors here's the button
and then this is a codable light so
you've got both vibration and light
feedback let's add some power turn the
PCB over there you go so the batteries
just go right in there
bippity Boppity ha ha that's not Harry
Potter nevermind
okay so we got oh that is RGB like in
that our Bluetooth looks like it's in
pairing mode oh wow wow these are really
step by steps a lot the first I'm Way
ahead of you way ahead of you make sure
your batteries are facing this way got
it
flip the PCB over make sure the blue
light is on if not check the batteries
are the right way right got it inside
this little black square our three
sensors a gyroscope that senses gravity
so the wand will know which way is up
and down an accelerometer so the one
will be able to know how fast it's going
and a magnetometer to calculate the ones
direct
so gravity speed right it's almost
looking like like a spell guide now
we're getting there
we're getting close so it knows if
you're moving it up down forward
backward left right fast or slow that's
cool so basically there's almost no
limit if you can get your muscle memory
just right - what you could do with it
okay more instructions on how to put in
the button I'm good I figured that out
wow they really yep they're making it
simple flip it over make sure the button
is peeping out I think we got this this
looked like heavy reading but actually
it's not pick up your wand with it
you'll do great things with the right
movements the right words a bit of
curiosity and courage when this then
flame particles Windex flame particles
one why that's cool you can make
feathers flow flames flow jelly beans
grow and gorgeo first challenge let's
use your coding wand to make a feather
levitate open the objects tray got this
drag the block onto your code space
change seconds to milliseconds and open
the physics tray and drag this block
right about there so every one
millisecond do objects that position of
all two x and y coordinates of the wand
cool so drag this block into your code
space throw that on to your exposition
oops look there you go and then we also
need the wand Y position there we go and
then we open the physics tray and set
the angle to oh I see what we want to do
so we want to change pitch to roll that
way we can roll the feather around very
cool so you can actually see a preview
see that so you can wave and roll your
wand and watch the feather match your
movements and then Reducto
you can choose what kind of beans you
want we could do regular beans and
gorgey oh wow ha ha
can you guys hear the the vibrating
feedback oh I can't make them any bigger
okay Reducto I'm a wizard airy so we're
gonna cast a cast
immobulus on a swarm of Cornish Pixies
we'll do change all to random and change
0 to 60 so they fly towards each other
so this is gonna be quite the swarm of
Pixies then so this is creating our
Pixies then we need to create a wand
action to control these bloody things
we've got our one centered thanks to the
power of block coding even I was able to
figure it out so now we can restart the
program you can see what happens is we
have a bunch of pixie spawn and they're
running all over the place in zero
gravity boom off it goes and then you go
like this Wow
and they freeze immobulus last challenge
now we get to create fire this is
actually the part I was waiting for
first add a loop so we are always
generating particles one of the neatest
things about this software is that you
can see what's happening in real time
over on the side so I can see that every
one second is not great so now every one
millisecond now we get a thousand times
as much fire and then if I were to point
my wand at the screen here I'm just
going to Center it again boom now I'm
creating these these particles that are
flying out from the point of the wand so
you can see the cursor there as well
there you have it summoning fire out of
the wand and you can follow along with
absolutely everything that we changed so
now instead of having uniform particles
we've made them clumpy ER we've made
them change color and we've made them go
from bigger down to smaller so that you
get a much more realistic fire like
effect with your wand so this
just a small slice of what you'll be
able to do with the Harry Potter canno
coding kit you will actually be able to
program actions for gestures and just
like the original can oh the sky is the
limit in terms of your creativity so yes
there's going to be tutorials and demos
and little challenges that you can
complete if you're looking to take a
Harry Potter fan in your life be they
small or adult sized and introduce them
to the power of coding but then the real
fun is to be had in the learning
experiences that you can have after
you've completed the in-the-box
challenges so guys it's going to be
available for $99.99 starting October
1st and you can pre-order it right now
at the link in the video description
guys if you want to find out more
information you can check out the link
in the video description thank you for
watching and thanks again to Cano not
only for sponsoring this video but also
for letting me be one of the first
people in the world to experience this
piece of computing magic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
