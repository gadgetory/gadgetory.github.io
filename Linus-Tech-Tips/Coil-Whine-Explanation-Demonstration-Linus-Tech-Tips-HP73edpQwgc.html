complained about and talked about a lot
on Linus tech tips in general but I
don't think I've ever actually
demonstrated what it is so this is a
graphics card this is a 7970 reference
card and my observation with the
reference cards for 7970 has been that
there's a fair amount of coil line so
I've had a lot of people kind of say
well suck it up princess so I but I
think I should leave it to individual
users to decide if it's something that
will bother them or not
bear in mind guys this card is on a test
bench it's not installed in a case right
now so the case will will help to reduce
some of this noise and it's particularly
offensive if you do have a high
sensitivity to high-pitched noises
whereas if you don't have that
sensitivity then coil whine is a lot
less bothersome once you have it there's
really not a lot you can do about it
some combinations of power supplies can
help that's that's pretty much it like
some power supplies will react worse
with the power delivery system on a
particular video card and cause it to
whine more or less but that's pretty
much all there is to it so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to position the
graphics card itself about as far away
from the microphone as my voice is now
so I'm going to turn my mic around very
ghetto solution for doing that ok sorry
about that guys so I'm going to position
the mic right there and I'm going to
launch a game in this case it's not a
particularly demanding demanding game
this is halo 1 there you go nice and a
low one I'm gonna let you guys listen to
the noise and you all can decide what
you think of it
so this is why I don't like coil line
it's particularly bothersome in
applications where it's fine-tunes it's
why ninis - whatever you're doing so
check this out
so you can see it actually corresponds
to my movement so there you go guys
that's coil line that's what it sounds
like there's not a whole lot you can do
about it unless it's really really bad
you usually won't get an RMA for it so
just try and find a card that you know
doesn't really whine if you think that
that kind of thing will bother you
