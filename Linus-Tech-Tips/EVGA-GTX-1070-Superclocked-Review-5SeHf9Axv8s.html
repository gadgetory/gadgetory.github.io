situation right now we're aftermarket
cards are being priced lower than the
reference founders edition of invidious
top end models one of the first of these
to hit the market is the EVGA 1070
superclocked which sports a factory
overclock and a somewhat flashy er
looking cooler the last time we had a
look at one of EVGA superclocked cards
we recommended it as the best value for
money among the rest of their lineup but
as different as the geforce 10 series is
from its predecessor is this still the
case let's dive right in
the ZBOX Magnus en 980 from ZOTAC is a
freaking liquid-cooled mini-pc holy crap
check it out in the lake at the video
description down below so our new super
clock 1070 is quite a departure from the
last generation of EVGA cards it's
ditched the stealthy mostly black look
in favour for a more metallic industrial
look on the front face of the new a CX
3.0 cooler you also get a brushed back
plate with the EVGA logo and a backlit
panel on the top also featuring the logo
something I personally find a little too
in-your-face and tacky but Linus and
John both actually liked it
so I guess beauty is in the eye of the
beholder as always and speaking of
backlighting there are plenty of white
lights on the front of the card so it
might be a good choice if you're rocking
a rig with a black silver or white theme
there's no RGB but plain white does work
quite well with the industrial aesthetic
of the card and white just kind of
generally goes with most themes anyways
so it's probably fine on the side you
get the standard complement of ports
including dual link DVI 3 DisplayPort
1.4 connectors and an HDMI 2.0 port for
4k at 60 Hertz with a supported monitor
under the hood the GTX 970 GPU has a
boost clock of seventeen hundred and
eighty-four megahertz one hundred higher
than the reference founders Edition but
the super clocked still has the same
four plus one power phase design and
eight gigabytes of gddr5 vram so how
much of a difference does the 100
megahertz bump make well unfortunately
not that much of one we tested it both
very high 1440p and then medium 4k
settings and across the board the super
clock 1070 and the founders Edition or
within one fps of each other with a
reference card actually winning by one
fps in a couple of tests probably due to
like I don't know alignments of the
planets or something the super clock to
only pull the way a bit in Crysis 3 at
4k where it managed three more frames
per second but of course a non-reference
cooler can often mean better
overclocking potential even with the
same power phase design so we cranked up
both our EVGA superclocked and our
founders Edition 10 70s to see if the
super clock 2 would
flex its muscles a little bit more we
were able to achieve a 125 megahertz
overclock on the superclocked over the
factory overclock and a 200 megahertz
overclock on the founders Edition using
both msi afterburner and EVGA s
precision x and OC scanner keep in mind
that because the super clock had a 100
megahertz factory overclock it was only
running 25 megahertz faster than the
founders Edition after we finished
dialing in all of our settings here we
saw a bigger jump of 2 to 3 FPS for the
EVGA card across the board but again it
didn't really put any distance between
itself and an overclocked founders
Edition but that isn't to say that the
superclocked
isn't better in any way as the new a CX
3.0 cooler kept the GPU at only 72
degrees Celsius at load when overclocked
a full 10 degrees lower than the
founders Edition with the ball bearing
fans staying quiet as well thermal
performance is easily this card's
strongest selling point and speaking of
selling points the super Clarke 1070
retails for 440 dollars that's only 10
bucks less than the founders edition
with other aftermarket design selling
for up to 60 dollars less than that
you're paying a fair bit for the nicer
cooler yes those $60 less cards have
fairly cheap plastic coolers and stuff
but still as raw performance and
overclocking potential are virtually
identical to nvidia x' reference card
that's a little rough yes those plastic
cooled cards won't perform quite as well
but still it's a bit disappointing as
the last superclocked card we reviewed
the EVGA gtx 980 SC was clearly better
out of the box verses the reference card
you can check out our testing for that
up here but that makes it so that I
can't really give the super clock 1070
an enthusiastic recommendation but the
interesting thing here is that it looks
like thermal performance may be worth
the extra cost over the like lower end
aftermarket currents that we mentioned
earlier if you really want that raw
overclocking performance over reference
though the for the win and classified
editions with their more aggressive
power delivery systems should be a lot
more interesting ting is a mobile
carrier that is focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction first
don't speak with a robot just get put
through directly to
a real person and pay only what you use
on average a ting bill is only $24 a
month per device if you're stuck in a
contract and switch to ting they will
cover 25% of your cancellation fee up to
$75 so head over to lino stockton calm
and try out their savings calculator to
figure out how much you would spend with
ting when you sign up you get a $25
service credit or $25 towards a new
device thanks for watching this video
guys if you liked it like it if you
thought I was hard on it like it or
dislike it I don't know you can do
whatever you want it's a free world you
can hit the subscribe button even if you
want to because you know Eagles and
stuff John's here so I'm referencing
America a lot I don't know man
you can check out our t-shirts in the
video description down below you can
check out this video right here which is
on the 1070 original reference founders
edition review thing that's that's what
that video is if you want to buy one of
these cards you can check those out on
Amazon they have this one and other 1070
s on there and other than that I'll see
you next time good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
