talk smart watch guys please the
pronunciation is talk like tick tock not
tok at least until they release a Bob
Marley edition the number of people who
have said that to me
the Coolermaster Glaser 240 L CPU cooler
delivers the convenience of an
all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more all right
so front and center on the talk is the
1.5 5-inch Mirasol display with a
responsive accurate glass touchscreen
that was much more difficult to scratch
them the plastic one on my pebble the
main selling points of Mirasol are its
power efficiency its visibility and
direct sunlight and the fact that it's
color rather than monochrome all in all
it is an exceptional technology and I'm
very excited to see next generation ear
eaters and other smart devices that use
it
I do think Qualcomm marketing materials
have oversold it a bit though they're
working on refining it but for now the
colors while present are not nearly as
vibrant as the promotional videos would
have you believe now when it comes to
performance Qualcomm isn't really
talking about the hardware inside but
booting it up is fast navigation is
snappy so I guess I don't really care
what processor is inside or how much RAM
it has more important to me is power
efficiency and I got similar battery
life on my talk as I did on my pebble
with its black and white display so you
can color me impressed there pun
intended my only issue with the battery
life is that I really don't know how it
would compare if the backlight behaved
the way that I want it to among the
glaring omissions in cual comes
companion Android app is any kind of
meaningful backlight behavior adjustment
you can set the double tap speed and the
timeout time but brightness control is
missing as is accelerometer based
activation like the pebbles wrist flick
and there's also no option to have the
backlight illuminate automatically when
a notification is received instead if
it's dark out I actually have to
manually turn on the backlight it might
seem like a minor complaint
but if you consider how prominently the
always on nature of the display so you
can glance at your wrist and see what's
on it at any time featured in Qualcomm's
marketing it's obvious that they
understand the importance of not needing
to touch it or do some contrived gesture
in order to read it so hopefully that'll
be added soon so let's talk everyday use
the included wireless charging dock
unfolds like that is a big plus
it uses Y power le which boasts support
for multiple devices at the same time
and with a larger charging field
compared to Chi the clock flips 90
degrees making it easy to read on your
bedside table and honestly the only
thing missing here is again a backlight
thing is the option to keep the
backlight on when it's charging so it
can completely replace the clock on my
nightstand the fact that it's waterproof
is also great I actually didn't know
that yet when I was giving the baby a
bath one night and I realized I was
wearing it so panic moment there but to
my relief it is indeed waterproof it's
also definitely a head turner I get a
lot of people asking me about it which
is fun for techno files with the pebble
people are like heck is that whereas
with this people are like oh that's cool
what is that and I mean as much as that
might have something to do with my
pebble being bright orange either way
you know I gotta give credit where
credit is due people liked it they asked
about it and it's fun
the vibrate is both easy to feel and not
unnecessarily loud as I said before it's
very responsive which leads us to the
main menu each icon on the main screen
represents an applet which is their name
for an app there aren't really many
available but what is their works pretty
well there's weather stock checking
message log call history and of course
music control which I used a lot
navigation is super intuitive just swipe
from the sides when you want to go back
or forward and I really liked being able
to go back into my notification history
much more easily than with my pebble
where things just kind of seemed to
disappear there is one thing I noticed
that must be a bug though individual
emails show up and you can click on them
and read the email when you have
multiple emails
that arrived at sort of around the same
time you are stuck with just a preview
of both of them and you can't click
further to read the actual emails that
is absolutely brutal I should be able to
just tap to see the whole thing not be
stuck at this screen staring at a couple
of different subject lines the only
complaint I really have physically then
is that for me it's just not very
comfortable
the clasp which contains the battery is
bulky enough to be uncomfortable when
I'm typing and the wrist strap sizing
just didn't quite work well for me on
the fourth hole
it was floppy and all over the place
over the bones in my wrist but on the
third hole it's a bit tight and also
actually sits a little crooked on my
wrist this would be less of a concern if
it was possible to readjust sizing
through trial and error but Qualcomm is
completely insane approach to sizing
requires the user to actually physically
cut the non-replaceable strap to size so
you got to get it right the first time
or it's going to be too small and I
don't know what you would do with it I
mean I understand why the strap can't be
replaced there are actually buttons
built into it above and below the watch
face that controlled the backlight and
the main menu
but honestly I don't really like this
implementation anyway the touch points
are not clearly marked and they're both
small enough that I often miss them when
casually reaching for them while being
big enough that I often hit them
accidentally when I'm adjusting the
watch on my wrist or using the touch
screen but I could accept the
non-replaceable strap buttons if Paul
comm would at least let me configure
their functionality the backlight could
easily be handled by the onboard
accelerometer with motion control like
the pebble or even a sharp tap anywhere
on the device and then you could be
handled by I don't know swiping in from
a side or the top or a long user
configurable tap and hold or even left
the way it is then I could bind those
buttons to something else or nothing at
all just give me the option overall
though it's a really cool device and I
genuinely want it to succeed but the bad
news is that the software really needs
some work which would be fine except
that I'm just not sure that I feel like
they're focused on the right things
right now
four days before filming this they added
a half-hearted activity monitor to it
presumably because that's trendy right
now but there are still other
outstanding issues that range from
profoundly problematic like the fact
that I can only preview my emails rather
than read them all the way down to small
things that are just amusing like the
way it puts an apostrophe ending on a
small o rather than a zero in for the
time on some of the watch faces and I'm
just kind of sitting there more like
Qualcomm it's 2 o clock but it's not
2:05 it made me feel like an Irishman
was reading the time to me whenever I
was looking at my watch but there is
good news it could be worse at least the
vast majority of my complaints can be
fixed through software updates they can
as long as they go in the right
direction it's just that I feel like
it's going to be hard to sell a fixed
device when every review of it is based
on the flawed earlier software revision
for Qualcomm zones sake and for the sake
of their early adopters I wish they had
refined this stuff first or at least
been more competitive on the price at
three hundred and fifty dollars it's
$100 more than a pebble steel with it's
more mature app ecosystem but it does at
least offer a color display so there's
that it's more than a galaxy gear which
has abysmal battery life this one
doesn't I easily got five days out of it
but gear does offer a wider range of
functionality with its camera speaker
microphone etc and consider this at
three hundred and fifty dollars these
aren't really similar products but I
can't ignore that we're getting pretty
close to just buying some other luxury
electronic toy like a PlayStation 4 or a
32 gig Nexus 5 I mean this is a next-gen
gaming system we're talking about or a
full-fledged smartphone with a 1080p
display premium processor from Qualcomm
no less wireless charging the whole nine
yards overall I like the talk and I
think it has potential but in its
current state if I've got a finite
amount of money to spend talk will have
a hard time winning it from me guys
thanks for watching my talk review like
