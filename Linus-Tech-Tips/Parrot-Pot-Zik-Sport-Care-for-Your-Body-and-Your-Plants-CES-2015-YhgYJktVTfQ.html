brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
darn screen protectors out there as well
as hyperx here at the parrot booth were
discovering their about so much more
than just drones that fly around these
days they've got follow-ups to a couple
of their existing products right here
we've got the parrot Zeke sport now this
is very early stages right now for this
headset like these are 3d printed like
prototypes do not touch but I can tell
you a little bit about them they are
designed for as you may or may not be
able to figure out all on your your very
own they're designed for sports active
lifestyle that kind of stuff and they
are designed for listening to music just
like the original Zeke headphones so
let's walk through a bit of a bit of a
tour here so they go in your ears and
actually built into the in-ears is a
heart rate monitor they've got these
pads on the sides that are designed to
make them more comfortable as well as to
give you touch control just like the
original Zeke's for skipping tracks
adjusting volume and all that kind of
cool stuff they are designed to be
incredibly lightweight at least we hope
it's up in the air what material they're
actually going to be made of and they
include a bunch of smart feature so they
connect via bluetooth as you'd probably
expect from a parrot product and check
this out this is the app that has got a
lot more detail than I would have
expected to find and certainly more than
more than any other Fitness wearable
that I've seen so far so yeah you've got
your heart rate tracking you've got your
steps per minute you've got your oh wait
what the heck is this so this is ground
contact time ground contact time allows
you to compensate or not maybe not
compensate but at least monitor the way
that your gait is balance while you're
running so if you are leaning more
heavily on your right or your more
dominant foot this can help you correct
it by telling you oh hey you're actually
not running evenly you want to make sure
you're keeping your back aligned while
you're jogging this right here tells you
your vertical oscillation so how much
you're bobbing up and down is you're
running and this right here is really
cool so just by using this slider you
can control how much active noise
cancellation you're getting out of the
Zeke sport so let's say for example
you're running around and out of the on
AB dub train track not that I recommend
doing that please don't run on a train
track but let's say you were
want to just turn your noise
cancellation off so that if the train
comes you know what's going on but let's
say for example you want to be
completely in your own world you don't
want to know what's going on boom turn
the noise cancellation up to maximum and
you can tune out the rest of the world
no idea when this one's coming but looks
pretty cool so far on to a very
different lifestyle product now I
actually reviewed the predecessor / more
basic version of this not that long ago
the flower power but unfortunately even
though it pretty much takes care of your
plant for you it doesn't quite because
it just gives you a notification tells
you hey you should probably move me to
where there's more or less sunlight or
hey you should probably give me some
water this one pretty much takes all of
the guesswork out of it so this is the
h2o and unlike the flower power it now
comes with a built-in water reservoir so
if the plant is running dry it can
automatically dispense it it still got
the same sensors so right on the top
you're going to find a water sensor on
the bottom here you've got what is it
electroconductive something Inc some
kind of fancy ink that measures
fertilizer levels you've also got the
water sensor and then temperatures
measured both inside the housing here
for within the soil and then at the top
of the housing here for the ambient air
around the soil but that's not actually
the highest end one this one doesn't
have a release date or estimated pricing
or anything like that but this is the
parent pot and this one is even even
more intelligent and self-contained yet
again for the ultimate plant dummy so it
takes advantage of the same flower power
app so you can go through the what is it
five thousand plant database or
something along those lines i'm not
getting confirmation but it's something
like that you just basically select what
kind of plant you have in it and then
it's got all these incredible monitoring
and smart maintenance tools so you can
go ahead and look at not just the real
time stats and those are those are
really freaking cool so you can actually
see in the demo one they have it set up
so that I can force it to water the
plant even though it's not supposed to
and you can see the soil moisture level
to go up and go up and go up and you can
actually go ahead and put your hand over
the light sensor that's here at the
yeah at the top of the pot and you can
see the light level go down down down
real time on the graph but you can also
see all the historical data and get
status updates that give you a a clear
idea of how to make sure that your plant
is properly taken care of now it's got a
two liter reservoir you go ahead and
fill that on the side right here and
then it has I alluded to before the
little the little water sprayer so it
actually has four little water jets that
are fed by a pump that come up the sides
and then spray the whole entire top of
the soil nice and evenly to make sure
that your plant stays in pristine
condition very cool product definitely
something for those of us with
completely brown thumbs like me and I
think that pretty much wraps it up I
want to definitely thank our sponsor so
remember guys we're powered here at the
show by phantom glass they've got their
awesome phantom glass screen protectors
are made a gorilla glass so they're
perfectly clear they feel just like the
glass on your phone they're compatible

easy to apply and I also want to give a
