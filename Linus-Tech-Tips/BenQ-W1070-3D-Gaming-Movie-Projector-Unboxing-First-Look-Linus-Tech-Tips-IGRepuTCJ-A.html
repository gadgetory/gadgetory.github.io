a very exciting projector from Ben cute
so there's some shipping labels there's
some stuff going on here they don't say
a whole lot other than that this is a
1080p projector and the other really
cool thing about it isn't even on here
so this is the W 1070 and I wonder if
when we open it up we will find out what
is so interesting and awesome and cool
about this projector so I know I don't
normally talk about pricing but I should
start with a one interesting point and
that is that this projector is aimed to
be priced around a thousand bucks
so 1080p projector thousand bucks sounds
pretty good sounds interesting right
okay things are about to get a lot more
interesting and if you guys have already
read the description of the video then I
guess the suspense isn't really ouch
doing anything for you this is a 1080p
3d projector imma let that sink in for a
minute
1080p 3d projector so it is fully
compatible with 1080p blu-rays at 24 fps
it is also compatible with the new
standard called Nvidia 3d TV play and
what that does here's our remote there's
some baggies I can see this was a
resealed unit this is an eval unit so he
comes with like a euro-asian power cord
here so put that in there comes with a
vga cable of all things come on Ben Q
should come with an HDMI cable
especially because this projector has
multiple HDMI inputs so right blu-ray
movies also compatible with games so
NVIDIA has an extra driver that you can
buy as an add-on that makes this thing
fully capable of supporting their 3d
vision capable game titles so let's take
a close look at the projector itself so
let's start with the remote normal it's
fairly straightforward affair this is
pretty much what you'd come to expect so
it's got your power your menu navigation
your source selection your smart
EcoSmart II feels cool because it does a
few different things
help you save power and help you keep
your bulb life lasting longer so when
the there is no source detected it'll
automatically turn it on which is very
very cool it also allows you to
automatically save power with certain
cool features like when you pause the
movie it'll just turn itself on you can
save about 70% of your bulb power which
is very very neat
digital zoom brightness contrast color
tint 3d settings 3d invert test freeze
mean okay
various stuff like that now the
projector itself so here is the lens
cover which you're going to want to go
ahead and put like that it has active
cooling like most DLP projectors do
there's your infrared receiver for the
remote and then this guy right here is
just your little adjust guy so it's
going to have Auto Keystone which means
that even if you're pointing it up at an
angle to your wall you don't have to
worry about it ending up with you know a
trap or uh yeah I think trapezoid shaped
image or anything like that you just go
ahead and adjust it to whatever angle
you want it up more ventilation holes
here on the side it actually kind of
looks like an alienware computer on the
side if these with this pattern here and
then on the other side more ventilation
there as well on the back we find a
whole bunch of different inputs so we've
got audio in and out it does have
built-in speakers but as you've come to
expect from projector speakers they're
nothing special it has a component in
has your your standard RCA in it's got
s-video in VGA in serial as well as a
12-volt trigger mini-b USB and two HDMI
ports AC power in is here and your
Kensington lock is here overall build
quality feels pretty good for like a
what is you know a fairly low price
point projector in spite of the very
cool features as oh yeah it's got one
other thing here so you can adjust the
way the projector sits with this foot
here as well as this one right here this
one is fixed though so you do all of
your adjustments just like that to make
sure the image is level and all that
good stuff here we have a couple of
different things so number one is your
focus there's your focus wheel right
there number two is your zoom so you can
zoom the image a little bit number three
check that out lens shift considering
that this is a
again $1,000 projector lens shift is a
pretty cool thing to see so that allows
you to actually not just sort of adjust
the angles like this and point it
up-and-down but it allows you to use the
optics built into the projector to
actually move the image up and down
that's high-end optics stuff considering
again the price point that we're seeing
all your menu navigation buttons that
were on the remote are duplicated here
as well as your power button now this is
kind of interesting because they've
covered this up for some reason but this
is one of the main selling points of the
monitor is the well 3d gaming support so
give me a second
get this off so presumably there must be
a reason that that's covered up but I'm
kind of ashamed it says Nvidia 3d vision
ready on that sticker but maybe what
they mean is Nvidia's 3d TV play and it
supports a lot of different 3d mode so
whether it's from a blu-ray player or
whether it's from a graphics card you
can do 720p 60 Hertz and 3d over HDMI
you can actually use some of the other
connectors for 3d including VGA but you
won't get the same kind of resolution
the same kind of quality as you with
HDMI and given that HDMI cables cost
nothing these days and basically use
HDMI and then at 1080p you get up to 24
fps and oh yeah I should explain a
little bit more about the Eco modes that
it includes so not only does it dim the
light when you're not doing anything or
when the image isn't moving it seems
like it's paused or whatever else but it
also is able to dim the lights and
darken scenes which will actually give
you some of that better 10,000 to 1
contrast ratio that it boasts as well as
saving you power and the 2,000 lumen
brightness actually allows it to project
up to a 200 inch image which would be
bigger than the white screen behind me
no problem so I'm going to try this guy
out as soon as I get a chance using
either the included 3d glasses or well
using the included 3d glasses and the
Nvidia driver which is available as a 14
day trial I will let you guys know how
it goes I'm not expecting gaming to be
the best experience in the world at 24
fps but I'm really excited to try it out
with a 3d movie at
and then see how the 720p 60fps gaming
experience goes because this could be
the most versatile projector that you
can buy for around a thousand bucks now
and I might be holding it in my hands
and very excited about it so the glasses
are available as an add-on they're not
actually that expensive these are active
shutter glasses and they're powered by
batteries which go around
kyaaa okay they come with batteries you
just press those out thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the w7 10 from Ben Q and I hope you
guys are as excited as me about how this
thing performs in 3d</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
