carbide series 300 R I first had the
pleasure of laying eyes on this case at
CES 2012 and now I have one here in well
I can't really call it the studio just
at home where I happen to have some
light set up so that I can shoot some
videos but here I have it somewhere
where I can show it to you guys so let's
see what Corsair has to say for
themselves the carbide series 300 Aria
is a compact expression of the Corsair
philosophy great systems begin with a
great case open the easy access side
panel find a builder friendly design
with three tool free optical drive bays
and port will free hard drive bays with
integrated 2.5 inch SSD compatibility
there's room for extra long graphics
cards and it keeps your Hardware cool
with amazing air flow including 140
millimeter front fan 120 millimeter rear
fan which should be compatible with the
H 80 as well ok and dust filters are
removable for features much like this
maybe the foundation of your neck system
ok interesting so let's go ahead and get
it opened up you know what give me a sec
here guys now that we've got out of the
box we can have a bit of a look at this
particular chassis it does come packed
in a hard foam I do prefer a more soft
foam because it can be a little bit more
robust during shipping especially once
the system is fully loaded although as
you can see by the way I'm manhandling
it this case is not that heavy
so it is far less of a concern than it
is with heavy cases and they've gone
with more than inch thick foam so 99.99%
of the time it's going to be fine and
remembering that shipping is more of an
issue in Canada than it is
to anywhere else just because of the
size of this country and how sparsely
populated it is so cases often travel
very far before they eventually reach
the intended recipient so what else we
got included here bit of a QuickStart
guide but that's about it so let's go
ahead and buckle down here so the first
thing we see is the front of the case
which has and I'm a big fan of this
actually it has that plastic brushed
thing going on and I'm going to show you
guys ah yeah I'm going to show you guys
why I like that so much and it's going
to involve removing this computer which
has my cat perched on it and then moving
my backpack which is in the way on this
door in here so no no you don't have to
follow me in here I'm just gonna bring
out a brushed aluminum side panel from
my case
so here ha you're going to need to get
the light just right but you can see all
along the back edge of the side panel
our fingerprints can you see that can
you see the blemishes and the finish
yeah you can kind of see you could kind
of see it there and that shot you can
kind of see it here okay so why don't I
just wipe them off and the answer is
because I cannot you cannot completely
clean brushed aluminum because what
happens is the oils and acids and your
fingers H into that anodized brushed
aluminum finish and you cannot
completely clean it so I love this
plastic brush thing is the same as is on
the back of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
because it looks good it's lighter than
metal although not by much aluminum
doesn't weigh much and as much as you
touch it you can actually clean it off
so sorry I've harped on that enough
let's keep going I love the industrial
look at this design of this case overall
you can see these little I mean they're
just for aesthetics but they look like
kind of you know
yeah like kind of industrial with these
these bolt things going on here we've
got three five in a quarter-inch base
power and reset switches headphones and
microphone two USB 3.0 ports and then we
have a front thing which
100% sure how it works although I felt
some kind of a something going on down
there what's that
I haven't actually taken this apart I've
only seen it on demo at the at the
Corsair suite so pardon me for for my
ignorance there guys
yeah okay so what is this down here
nothing apparently okay so we have a
removable fan filter which is not that
easy to remove frankly not so that's
kind of a shame so you do have to peel
back some tabs in order to get that to
to come off although you'll be able to
blow it out sort of 99% of the time and
then I guess if you really wanted to
wash it you can take it off other than
that the inside is pretty
run-of-the-mill this is interesting
though this is a nice touch instead of
going with plastic security pieces for
the panel's courser has gone with these
pronged metal pieces and I don't know if
you guys noticed but in my unboxing of
Shinobi XL I actually when I took off
the top panel without even realizing it
immediately I broke off those plastic
pieces so this this is the kind of thing
that answers a question or like
addresses a concern that I sort of had
about cases in general because I've
never seen this before before I even had
a chance to talk to anyone about it so
that's really cool kudos Corsair way to
go so dual 120 s or 140 s it comes with
140 millimeter fan you can throw another
one in there to put cooling over your
hard drives there's a fair bit of
restriction on these fans but they've
done a little bit to alleviate this
problem by putting in some some
perforations here in addition to the
holes that you see on most cases right
here so let's go ahead and work our way
around the side we find a pretty
standard looking side panel over there
on the other side we find dual 120 s or
140 s on the other side so you can use
that to cool your graphics card on the
bottom we find a filter for the bottom
intake power supply as well as nice
grippy rubber feet and on the back of
the case we find that once again a
pretty run-of-the-mill design so we've
got our 120 millimeter exhaust with all
this is interesting so they've bulged
out the 120 millimeter grill a little
bit to give you a bit more
between the back of the fan and the
grill this not only reduces the
turbulence and increases the airflow
it's able to push through but it also
reduces the noise just a little FYI for
you guys some perforations here bottom
mounted power supply and everything's
looking pretty hunky-dory in there here
we have dual 120 s or dual 140 s would
have preferred to see the 120 centered
and seen a couple more holes put in it
just so that if you're running a
radiator such as an H 100 you would be
able to have that radiator centered
because you can see it and hold on a
second I just gotta throw this mouse for
my cat to is bothering my filming
assistant alright there we go let's put
the front back on before we get too much
further here I do want you to guys to I
want you guys to appreciate the case the
case is finished design rather than just
you know with me having 20 depart
already more ventilation here on the
sides so that is how those front 140
millimeter fans are getting all their
air flow not only from these sides but
also the mesh in the front as well as
this hole in the bottom so very very
good access to fresh air for those fans
all right here we go take off those
thumb screws side panels pull off the
side panel so this is a more value
oriented case but Corsair still managed
to keep the side panel reasonably strong
although it is nothing compared to you
know something like the 650d or the 800
d which are obviously very very
high-grade cases which go ahead and take
off this other side panel as well give
you guys a brief look at the other side
here there you go that is a huge CPU
cutout so no matter where your CPU
socket is located on your board remember
every time the every time the CPU socket
changes the the average sort of usual
locations tend to shift around a little
bit so they've planned for the future
giving you as much space as they
possibly can in terms of cable
management room you can see we have a
fair bit of space back there we've got
an entire thumb width which is a pretty
good indicator
we should be able to fit a 24-pin
connector back here with no issues
whatsoever we've also got cable
management holes here here here and here
allowing us to also here for the eight
pin access the optical drives the hard
drives any other kinds of drives we
might install in the front of the case
that's about it I wouldn't have minded
seeing another cut out here maybe on a
like a revision you know 1.1 or
something like that because some other
boards these days do have the eight pin
in the middle and unless you have a
power supply with a very long cable you
might not make it all the way sort of
over here from that hole so just
something to bear in mind although Oh No
look at this ah they thought of that you
can probably run it through here no
problem because you can see where the
motherboard mounts are so you should be
able to squeeze it in there alright what
else we got on the back this can this
can serve as routing for your front
panel audio because most motherboards
have that located over there although
you might have to cheat a little bit and
push your heart push it through before
you put the power supply and stuff like
that and I think that covers it for this
side of the case yes it does
ok let's flip it around here so here's
our tool is five and a quarter inch base
here is the enormous space that we have
in this case accommodating up to four
hundred and fifty millimeter graphics
card I mean imagine that it would be
like this much longer than a motherboard
so I don't think that's coming anytime
soon but there you go
Corsair will be ready for it regardless
okay we've also got our three and a half
inch or two and a half inch hard drive
mounts so there are the two and a half
inch mounting holes these don't look
that strong but trust me once you put a
drive in them they are significantly
more robust here's how Corsair ships the
accessories and doodads let's have a
look what we got in here some zip ties
for cable routing some screws we're not
getting a whole lot of extras but there
isn't a whole lot to supply I mean
something like an 800 d comes with
cables for the hot-swap and stuff like
that but this doesn't really have that
does this come out no it doesn't I mean
other than that I think we've pretty
much covered it I mean you got your dual
one for use in the front you got your
dual 140 s up here you got your 120 back
here you got your one
built into the power supply here this is
a very very capable case and course our
always does such a good job of these
little details even on their value cases
black interior all black cables down to
the connectors on the very end front USB
three is with an internal header which
they all should have been from day one
but no one could decide on a standard
and I think that pretty much wraps it up
this is going to just if you want my
opinion these are just going to clean up
in that sub hundred dollar case market
because it's it doesn't come down
necessarily to like the materials that
are used it's a steel case you know with
a plastic front bezel but it comes down
to the design and the engineering that
goes into it because it looks really
good and it's I've seen high-end builds
done in this case already it does not
look like a sub $100 case once you put
some decent hardware in it so that's a
kudos to Corsair on this one so thank
