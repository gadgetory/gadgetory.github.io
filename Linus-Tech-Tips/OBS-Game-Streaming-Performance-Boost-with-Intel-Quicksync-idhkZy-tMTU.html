DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts alright guys so
as you know streaming can be hard to do
stuff like system overhead and you're
not only playing a demanding game but
you're encoding it and streaming it and
that's probably not all you're probably
playing music programs voice chat
programs and if you're like me you have
a browser with at least a bucket worth
of tabs open this would be hard on your
processor enter OBS with quick sync
using quick sync instead of x264 will
allow you to move your encoding
processing off of your processor and on
to your I GPU which is actually still
part of your processor but when you're
normally streaming if you have a
graphics card it'll use your processor
in your graphics card and your eye GPU
just sits there doing a whole lot of
nothing being able to utilize this part
of your processor is going to take some
stress off the rest of your processor
and allowed to do other things
performance wise it's actually pretty
good but you're gonna have to remember
that this is called quick sink not like
looks amazingly beautiful sink it's not
going to look quite as good on the other
end of the stream but it will be easier
for you to run so maybe if you're
pushing some really hard to run game and
doing a bunch of other things at the
time and it's going to chug on the other
end if you run quick sync if it looks
better because it's not lagging that's
going to be a big benefit but the actual
picture quality probably won't be as
good as something like x264 the
requirements aren't too bad you can need
an intel cpu which should have probably
been pretty self-explanatory
you should probably update your drivers
and your bios as well and you're going
to need OBS is that's a software that
you have to run to check to make sure
that your processor is compatible with
quick sync you just google the name of
your processor so say 2600 k go to the
ARC intel comm link and then do a ctrl F
for quick it'll jump right to it and
I'll say yes or no in a blue highlighted
box right beside it pretty
straightforward at least on a seuss
motherboards how you'll set it up in the
BIOS level is to press f7 go into
advanced BIOS then go over to advanced
jump into graphics configuration go down
to CPU graphics multi monitor and change
that to enable
that's all you'll need so after doing
that just press f10 enter and you're
good to go
once you're done setting up your BIOS
you're going to jump into your computer
right click on your desktop and click on
screen resolution then all you have to
do is click detect and find the display
that is powered by your eye GPU it'll
say Intel graphics whatever number tell
it to try to connect on VGA anyways
apply that setting before you can
actually do anything else jump back to
your main monitor until it to extend
these displays instead of just showing
on desktop one after that click keep
changes and you'll be good to go doing
that last step is very important if you
haven't done that last step properly OBS
will allow you to select Quick Sync but
it won't actually work and will just
spit out an error so to select QuickSync
properly just go into OBS and then go
into settings go to encoding and then
change the radio button from x264 over
to quick sync as long as you're not
streaming at the time of changing this
it'll work perfectly fine the next time
you start streaming it'll be streaming
through quick sync all right guys I
think this whole setup is pretty cool I
like quick sync my biggest problem with
quick sync is that it's not in enough
stuff hate me as much as you will but
I'm an expert guy not necessarily an OBS
guy so I'm not necessarily gonna be able
take advantage of this comment section
down below
whether you like expert or OBS and while
you're down there don't forget to like
this video if you liked it and subscribe
and dislike this video if you disliked
it and also subscribe because whatever
will make one that you like later if you
want to get a little bit more of a high
end discussion be sure to jump over on
the forum you guys can talk there if you
don't like the ads that you see on the
forum you can become a contributor at
any contributor level you get rid of all
the ads so don't worry too much about
that that will just be entirely fine if
you want a shirt that is not this one
and know this is not an NVIDIA shirt
every single time I wear this I get
comments on that you can jump to our
t-shirts link down in the description
below we've got some pretty cool stuff
there and hopefully some cool stuff
coming later on thanks a lot for
watching this video and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
