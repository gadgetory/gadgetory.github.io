from an tech the advanced gaming
authority is what they have to say about
this case of every kind of inclines
agree agree with them at this point
based on what I've seen about the 1100
so far maximum expandability that is up
to 330 millimeters long expansion cards
and for whatever reason they don't
mention it but they've also got 9
expansion slots which is madness ok
maximum cooling so they're showing all
the different places you can install
cooling fans including he - here - here
- one big one here one here and one here
okay we've got ease-of-use which shows
you how you can route your cables they
even show braiding the cables behind and
that is because they have an inordinate
amount of space behind the motherboard
tray so you can actually close your
panel even if you're running thick old
cables like this PS you've been taken
from fan filters fan connector PCB which
allows you to connect for three pin fans
to a single molex for improved cable
management which is true 120 ml intake
at the back 120 mil thermal okay yep
we've covered most of this oh look that
two more 120 mils on the side this
harddrive mount I'm going to show you
this is cool front panel USB 3 and 3 to
list five and a quarter inch drive bays
which I have seen in action already and
they do actually work really well which
is good I'm actually usually not a huge
fan of toolless unless it's like a tack
station or something because I don't
know something about just putting a
screw in it makes it feel more secure
and safe to me
but really matter so let's go ahead
from its box which as always is very
well packaged Antec is pretty has been
doing this a long time so they're using
a good quality closed cell phone with
about one inch of padding on all sides
which is pretty much a necessity if you
want the case to make it in one piece
we've actually had sample cases arrived
that were not packed with closed cell
foam that looked like they had been
shipped not from California but from the
depths of hell to reach us so yeah this
one now that I've said all that is in
immaculate condition which is good okay
let's start at the front so the
11-hundred is actually very similar to
the p2 80 in terms of the actual chassis
design but there are some key
differences so we've got our three five
and a quarter inch bays our front
headphones our front USB to our front
USB 3 you can see this power and reset
button placement has been reused from
the p2 80 we've got tons of room for air
intake so we've got the mesh here and
then these are also completely open see
how I can stick my finger through there
so you're getting additional airflow
through there as well as the mesh the
front pops off like this
there you go so you can see how open
these are now check that out so it's
completely unrestricted airflow and now
you can mount fans here and here and
check this out bumps here here here and
here
which allows you to install these two
fans with only four screws which is
easier and better for gamers because in
my experience gamers are nothing if not
lazy no offense to the gamers I'm sure
you already knew that there we go
alright so let's go ahead and let's go
to this side first so here we find our
side panel window nice and big I'm just
gonna take these plastics off as we go
we've also got room for two rubber
grommet 'add 120mm fans once again you
can mount them using only four screws
four of these are just blanks that will
hold the fan in place very very nice
good thinking antec so those
innovations that make gamers lives
slightly slightly easier make them
choose your product over someone else's
so I'm gonna take that side panel off
and we're going to go around to the
other side panel actually we're gonna do
the back panel first so here is a 120
millimeter cooling fan as well as the
i/o ports we've also got nine expansion
slot so yes up to XL ATX motherboards
which is great if you want to run
three-way or form is Li ATX power supply
and check this out see this these
cooling vents here that's for a good
reason and I'm gonna show you why
because you can actually well actually
you know this is probably easier to show
from here so check this out you can
install a 120 millimeter cooling fan
that blows directly at the back of the
motherboard and then exhausts out there
now why would you want to do that why
well I will give you the reason hey
check this up very cool actually give me
a second I'll go get my prop then
they'll be done all right here I have my
prop now guys I've got an X 79 board and
I'm gonna show you why you might care
about having cooling on the back of the
board check this out
we have pwm components on the back of
this board because with all these DIMM
slots there's so little room on these
x79 boards for them to put voltage
regulation modules check this out and
the side board same thing heatsink on
the back of the board what's gonna cool
that heatsink in most cases nothing so
having a little bit of extra cooling
although I probably wouldn't use it as
an intake I would probably use it as an
exhaust and just pull air from the
outside here and push it out could be
useful okay so let's keep going on the
inside of the case our accessories wise
we've got some zip ties some screws to
lift drive rails which are really cool
I'm gonna show you these in a minute
actually but but here here's something
to note about them is see how they're
bent that's on purpose so wait we have a
locking fan filter so you pull that out
you just push it like that now it's
locked it won't come out and then you
just push it down that's mostly for
shipping you just want to keep it
unlocked if you're actually using the
case right
they just pull that out clean it slide
it back in it's more convenient than the
ones that are from the back of the case
especially that long one in the 800 D
that it's kind of a pain to get out I
know because I had to do it the other
weekend all right in terms of
dry-mounting one two three four five six
three and a half inch drives here and
check this out we've also got a
tool-less SSD mount this is a pressure
mount so you just slide the SSD in and
grab an SSD so you just slide the SSD in
and it gets held there sorry guys here's
mine SSD here's that pressure mount so
you just kind of pop it in there so you
can see there's some friction you can
put in a screw if you want right about
there and then it will be completely
secure very cool
not as cool as the three and a half inch
drive mount though which I am going to
show you at some point ultra big CPU
cutout and this is handy because the
motherboard CPU spa pocket positions
keep changing so if you have a case
where they haven't built in some extra
you know kind of fudge factor for where
it could be located then you might not
end up being able to access the back of
the motherboard at all in which case you
can't change the cooler so antek thought
of that they made the cut out as big as
they possibly could and you can see even
on a new generation x 79 board we have
no difficulty with that there's that top
200 mil fan there's that molex to 4/3
pin fan connector adapter doodad so that
is allowing us to easily manage the
cables of these fans right here and then
we'll also actually I never showed you
guys this on the back we can also adjust
the LEDs for the top fan we can turn
them off or on and then we can change
fan speeds on the p2 80 but we can't do
it on this one okay what else we got
here ah yes kill management check this
out guys look how thick that is at the
back of the motherboard tray so you can
put pretty much like whatever you want
back there and you can still close the
side panel because this is the border so
you can put a 24 pin they show up raided
a couple braided cables coming up to the
graphics cards on the butt on the back
of the box here our cable management
holes so you can see these are a nice
loose
of rubber so you can put cables through
them pull them out and then it'll still
be it'll still be blocked from view and
last but not least oh yeah here a pin
pull so you can run your a pin connector
up there to your the top of your
motherboard and then you've got also
other miscellaneous stuff so you can
bring down your front panel connectors
which there are quite a few down this
way down to the bottom of your
motherboard and then haha yes this is
probably one of the coolest things that
I've seen in a while as far as harddrive
mounting goes because let's face it how
interesting can a harddrive mounting
possibly be so we're gonna go ahead and
how's this work now yes good put this on
here okay so you just put that on you
put that on there so this is a very cool
yet right so you put this and you slide
it into the case and you guys are
thinking Linus we've seen this before
and I'm thinking yes but not quite like
this one
okay now hard drives are worth a lot of
money these days would I do this whoa
right okay now watch this I am gonna
protect it a little bit just in case ah
that's right once you put them on they
cannot be removed except easily like
this I know right so basically what an
tech has created by making this thing
bent is a way to secure the hard drive
in a way that is very very secure from
both sides you can see how much I'm
pulling on it look I'm actually bending
the plastic bending the plastic even
more that's the trick so if you pull on
it from the middle evenly the hard drive
cannot come out but if you remove it
specifically from one side first then it
comes off easily so I thought that was
neat so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the enttec
