remarkably safe and simple
some years back chinese tube amplifier
companies came crashing onto the
headphone amp scene offering impressive
specs and features at prices that
traditional audio companies were simply
nowhere near if you wanted something
with similar performance and inexpensive
worldwide shipping but all of the usual
questions must be asked when buying
something from China before investing
your hard-earned dollars because they're
still not cheap will the manufacturing
quality be consistent are they using
high-quality componentry what about
after sales support well over the last
few years one of these Chinese brands
has expanded their portfolio beyond a
few products established a solid track
record for user support and has turned
into pretty much the go-to for
inexpensive but high-quality Chinese
built tube amps and that is little dot
and this is the Mk for a premium single
ended headphone amplifier and one of the
most famous with a 469 deep appreciation
thread on head Phi that's actually been
running since 2010 but was even posted
in today but before we get into this
product you're probably asking yourself
already well why would I even want a
tube based headphone amplifier I heard
from oh I don't know my plumber some
tall dark tech savvy hippie or something
but they're bad and solid-state amps are
much better great question and it comes
down to the subjectivity versus
objectivity argument that has been and
continues to be a raging Internet war
hopefully I can clarify things a little
bit objectively tube amplifiers do
typically sound different than accuracy
above all else solid-state amplifiers
like the objective - they're less bright
more natural sound signature is real and
a result of a number of factors
including their relatively high output
impedance also objectively they straight
up do introduce Distortion and therefore
will not achieve that purest for better
or for worse it sounds exactly like the
original recording goal that you might
be going for but that is where
subjectivity
comes in a lot of people don't give any
cares about that they just want an
enjoyable listening experience and to
their ears the richer bass warmer sound
and subdued highs of the tube amp sounds
eh okay into those people I'll say this
rock on
just keep your thoughts about the
obvious superiority of tubes to yourself
but before the solid-state fanboys get
all high and mighty now - and Logan are
on our side about this frankly I don't
want to hear about the obvious
superiority of solid-state either enjoy
music is not that black and white and
there are other variables at play here
like the fact that everyone here's a
little differently that make it actually
impossible to have a one-size-fits-all
solution so take the rest of this video
for what it is my own subjective
personal experience with the little dot
mark for tube headphone amplifier the
manual is functional if not amazing the
only things I really needed it for were
the fairly specific instructions for
powering the unit on and off and the
procedure for flipping the dip switches
on the underside to increase gain to
five when I was testing my fairly
inefficient LCD - headphones
aha the warning about how hot it gets
was also pretty helpful as well the unit
itself was well packed in soft foam and
looks absolutely stunning the vacuum
tubes and the gold accents give it a
very steampunk look and frankly the
wasted decks face aside if I was going
to go pick a headphone amplifier just
based on how badass it's going to look I
would probably go this route in the box
little dot includes a power cord a
headphone adapter and a set of RCA
cables so you'll be able to easily plug
into an existing external DAC they're
perfectly nice and only folks who
believe in fancy cables are likely to
replace them onto the listening tests
with my son Heiser hd8 DJ's frankly it
was impossible for me to tell the
difference between my stack and the
mark 4 I figured the strong base and
lack of sparkle in the HD eights in the
first place was making it hard to make
out those characteristics in the tube
amp so I moved on to my DT 990 Pro 250
ohms from Bayer dynamics these
headphones have a lot of fans but I
don't personally really like them
because the clear and accurate highs are
a little bit too bright for me and I
find them fatiguing to listen to still
couldn't tell moving on to the Audis LCD
twos whether it's my music tape
on ashame top 40 listener here or
something else I still just couldn't
tell as it happens the LCD to sound
fantastic on the mark 4 but I guess that
leads to the only real conclusion that I
could draw from this buy whatever makes
you happy
aside from the high price and the usual
tubing conveniences it does take a few
seconds to power on you may get the
occasional audible anomaly and you
should clean and replace your tubes from
time to time the mark 4s build quality
looks and sound quality out of the box
left nothing to be desired for me
another selling point is the fact that
it allows you to to roll or swap out for
different tubes which will be a lot of
fun if you're a tinkerer who wants to
experiment with different pairings the
way wine enthusiasts will look for
dishes that go well with their favorite
vintages personally I'm not and for me
the much more obvious differences
between one pair of headphones and
another make them a more sound
investment than searching for the
perfect amp but your mileage may vary so
there it is guys I mean feel free to
call me out on this video I don't mind
and I'll even save you the trouble of
debating the validity of my tests in the
comments aside from being conclusive
they are not scientific at all a
double-blind experiment with normalized
output volumes would have been a better
more scientific way of testing the two
against each other and while I do plan
to obtain an SPL meter and take another
crack at this on my own time for the
sake of training my ears and refining my
audio gear review process you the buyer
won't have any of that stuff anyway and
if I can't tell the difference when I
know which is which sitting right next
to them in the time it takes to switch
between them then my recommendation of
buy whatever will make your friends
think that you're cooler won't change
either way so I just don't think it's
that big of a deal thank you for
