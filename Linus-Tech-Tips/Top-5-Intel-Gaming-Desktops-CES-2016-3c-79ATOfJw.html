a show like CES is not an easy task
there are so many and the definition of
desktop has become more and more broad
in recent years but we're going to kick
things off with the msi 27 xt all-in-one
what makes this one special is the fact
that it is an all-in-one that features a
full-size graphics card mesh enclosure
on the back of the unit that connects
via a ribbon cable to a normal PCI
Express 16x slot there is no multi card
support but when you compare this to
something like completely enclosed non
upgradable all-in-one from the likes of
someone like Apple it is pretty
impressive especially for gamers and
that's not the only feature that might
matter to gamers the monitor that's
included with it is a 144 hurt panel now
it is a TN panel but it's got a 5
millisecond response time and it will
definitely be an improvement for gaming
over at the type of panel you'd normally
find in an all-in-one storage is handled
by an m2 nvme SSD oh wait 2 of them in
raid 0 and the processor as a core i7 9k
6700 it's got a USB type-c connector and
an SDXC card reader and starts at 1700
dollars not including the graphics card
you'll have to swap that one in on your
own next up we've actually got another
all-in-one from cyber this is a division
of cyber PowerPC although the cybers are
actually spelled differently this puppy
is in a 34 inch 34 40 by 1440 ultra wide
curved IPS monitor and closure
it's full of desktop parts and this is
cool there's nothing proprietary so it's
actually very customizable
and it's water-cooled it's got an
all-in-one liquid cooler from ASA tech
for the CPU that fits a 240 millimeter
radiator and it can also fit a custom
loop if you want something a little bit
more exotic it fits one full-sized
graphics card it can hold two two and a
half inch drives for SSDs or hard drives
although there is no three and a half
inch drive support and has a small
enough form factor that even though it's
got a power supply inside
it actually doesn't look that
unreasonably thick so the core i5 gtx
960 config starts at $900 but obviously
the sky is pretty much the limit when
we're talking non-proprietary parts next
up we've got the digital storm event in
3 now although the event of 3 has been
out for a little while this new version
will have a new cooling system and
before we get inside though we need to
take a look at the custom hand-painted
chassis this thing is massive at over 2
feet deep and over 2 feet tall and can
fit all standard motherboard sizes as
well as large dual CPU workstation
boards much like the one that we used in
our 7 gamers one CPU project but of
course you've got to keep all that stuff
cool somehow and the event to me feature
x' this completely integrated cooling
system that is absolutely fantastic
looking what's new here is the angled
fittings to reduce the cracking that can
sometimes occur with acrylic blocks the
case features support for three
radiators a 480 millimeter and a 240
millimeter included that are all on the
same loop and has this amazing looking
clear water distribution block behind
the motherboard tray to cool all your
components Digital Storm partnered with
ek for the cooling so it's done by a
company that really knows what they're
doing and they even take requests for
things like custom chipset coolers and
will install custom design parts within
reason you can also even ask for a
specific coolant color it comes with
cable covers and a power supply bridge
on the back of the motherboard tray to
keep everything tidy looking and like
most cases where you have power supply
cables kind of crammed into a corner
somewhere and it features RGB lighting
for the interior exterior and the
cooling the front i/o includes two USB
3.1 ports and a slim optical drive and
of course there's a gotcha
it starts at five thousand eight hundred
dollars with a CPU only water cooling
loop with flexible tubing instead of the
now more premium seeming rigid solution
that I personally don't do because it's
a lot of work which is also why it's
expensive because it's a lot of work the
new cooling system is expected to be
coming on January 27th
which brings us to the asus rog GT 51 it
supports our og Bend and NFC wristband
which you can touch to the case to do
two different things you can activate
shadow drive a hidden partition for
stuff you need to keep private or you
can automatically overclock setting up a
profile that the band will automatically
activate to crank up your CPU for gaming
and turn it back down to stock if you're
just doing something like web browsing
it's actually got more functionality
coming later like Auto windows login
there's a GPU air tunnel that works with
a shunt from the bottom front fan to
direct air over the GPU and the front
fan has a cooled turbine desk design for
the shroud it features eight million
colors of RGB customization a USB 3.1
type C front connector pretty cool
mostly that seen in the back and it's
got an amplified front audio jack for a
little bit of extra punch for your
headphones it's available in mid to late
q1 and starting at $1,800 which finally
leads us to the iBUYPOWER revolt - this
guy has a really unique chassis design
it's kind of like this weird but
surprisingly cool trapezoid thing
there's a tinted cover over the entirety
of the top and half of the front that
shows off your GPU on the very top and
up to two SSDs in the front and the
sides can be removed to reveal a very
interesting internal layout that crams
in a surprising amount of non
proprietary hardware so you could put in
pretty much any ITX case full-size ATX
power supply three and a half inch drive
and GPU that you could want including
liquid cooling all without having to
deal with any sort of thermal throttling
that bottom can actually support up to a
dual 120 millimeter radiator or a single
120 and a single 140 if you wanted to
water cool both the CPU and the GPU it's
expected to be available sometime later
this month
