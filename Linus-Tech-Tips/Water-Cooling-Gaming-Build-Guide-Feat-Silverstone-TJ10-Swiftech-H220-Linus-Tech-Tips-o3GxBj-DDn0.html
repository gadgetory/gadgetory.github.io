gaming promo calm welcome to a gaming
build guide that we're doing here guys
so we've got a silverstone TJ 10 a
silverstone strider gold evolution 1000
watt with their sweet braided cables
that are actually using like a nylon
rather than a plastic braid so they're
absolutely perfect in terms of not being
able to see through to the cords
extremely durable all that kind of good
stuff they look absolutely awesome for
liquid cooling we're gonna be going with
a swift tech h 220 but we're actually
going to be expanding it so we're gonna
add a liquid cooled GTX 670 as well as a
black ice extreme single 120 millimeter
radiator giving us a total of 3 by 120
millimeter rads one of which is a thick
rad as well as a liquid cooled 3770k and
the liquid cooled GTX 660 in the same
Luke so hmm sorry I said 660 I meant 670
we're also going with a gigabyte
thunderbolt ready board this is a z77
xup 5 th so this is pretty much state of
the art as far as features get it
actually has dual thunderbolt ports for
memory we're gonna go with 16 gigs of
Corsair Dominator platinum 24 hundred
megahertz memory so this is just I mean
honestly this is a showcase piece we
want it to look awesome it's also got
the blue light bars in it so this is
going to be a blue themed build hence
the use of blue LED fans for our
radiators as well as a high yes to
Samsung 840 pro 256 gigs in raid zero
and of course the centerpiece the
silverstone TJ 10 and we're pretty much
ready to go so this isn't going to be an
exact step-by-step how to put cpu in
socket that kind of build guide but it's
just going to be kind of following along
with us as we build up this sweet
looking liquid cooled machine oh yeah
we're using blue tubing as well now one
of the first thing
we're gonna do because we have to expand
our swift tech age to 20 is we're gonna
loosen there you go the included hose
clamps and we're actually going to drain
the system completely and swap out the
fluid for something else so we're also
going to swap out the tubing because we
don't have more of Swift ex-black tubing
on hand and for our blue theme to build
we wanted to use blue tubing anyway so
step one is to loosen there you go that
clamp which holds the tubing in place
now you want if you're gonna reuse these
clamps you want to use 3/8 inch ID 5/8
inch OD tubing so you go there's the
swift tech high Drex water that's inside
so we're gonna take the whole thing
apart then what we're going to do to
simplify the filling procedure for
ourselves is we are going to put it back
together with all the additional
components in the loop we're gonna kind
of measure where the tubing is going to
go and then we're going to fill it then
we're gonna put the whole assembled
thing back into the system this will
allow us to fill it as thoroughly as
possible without trapping any air
bubbles in it now the plastic brackets
that allow for tooless installation of
120 millimeter fans have to be removed
from the top of the case so you just
take out the 8 screws here here here and
here
and then you can just pull those
brackets out just like that we're gonna
replace them with the rad support
bracket that is available as an add-on
for the TJ o 9 and TJ 10 case from
silverstone so we've made some changes
now we've actually gone ahead we figured
out that we can mount the rad bracket
directly to the fans rather than
mounting it to the rad as it says in the
instructions so this gives us the
ability to use the reservoir that's
built into the
VH 220 which means we don't have to pre
assemble the loop if we don't want to
because we'll be able to pull it out top
it up and then put it back in if the
need should arise so we can just go
ahead and show you guys where this is
going to go so it screws in sort of here
somewhere something like that there we
go just like that so it's gonna sit in
the top then our thick red is going to
go back here we've also installed the
power supply I'm just going to pull this
back out so we've installed the power
supply with its sleeving and we're
trying to figure out what we're gonna do
in terms of cable management because
this case is a little bit dated and it
doesn't have the best cable management
out there
oh yeah last thing
so this is an important step at this
stage in the build so you can see where
the cables are running out of the fans
so you have to plan for we're planning
to plug all the fans into our
motherboard so this one's going to go
here this one's going to go here the
pump is going to go to the CPU fan the
rear fan is going to go to the bottom
one here and the front fan is going to
go here that way we can use the
motherboards utility to control all the
fans in this system so we ended up
scrapping the black ice extreme I
remember what I hated about these
radiators and that's that the mounting
holes are 120 mil but the actual
radiator is quite wide so we weren't
able to fit it in our case the bad news
is that we had to use a thin radiator to
replace it and it's a bit of an older
one but I'm going to show you guys my
magic trick for fixing beat-up radiators
and sharpie marker and sharpie marker it
actually works surprisingly well you
have to look at it pretty close to
realize that it's been touched up with
with a permanent marker so there you go
guys there's a line of tech tips for you
draw on your computer if there's
anything about it that you don't like it
even works for little places where the
fins are bent you just throw some
sharpie in there and it becomes a lot
less noticeable there you go just
thinking disappears like that it's
awesome we've also mounted the
motherboard into the case so there you
go that's what it's going to look like
this is for some kind of like server
thing or something like that once we get
the black the black of the other side
panel on there should look a little bit
better but I would have preferred if
Silverstone had stuck with the older
revision which didn't have this hole in
it and I think that's pretty much our
status update for now alright so we're
about to load our drives in which is on
these convenient rails with padding for
anti-vibration however we won't have to
worry about that because we're using two
new half inch drives on three 1/2 inch
adapters don't mind the OCZ adapters the
the drives are Samsung still so there we
go
clicks in just like that and I'd also
like to take a moment to show you guys
our CPU block installation so that's
done so these three and a three-eighths
inch tubes are gonna route to this
radiator that radiator and that GPU
block also the cable management although
it's not perfect in this case because
we're using individually sleeve cables
we did manage to get the
pin behind the motherboard and have it
come up individually so it's nice and
thin back there and go behind the board
also the 24 pin is gonna look pretty
decent right here I think and then we've
got all of our front panel ones are
routed behind the motherboard tray in a
bit of a tricky way so I'm gonna go
ahead and flip this around so you guys
can check it out
well it's getting heavy already Wow okay
so there you go so these have to come
between this support brace here and the
motherboard tray then there's a little
bit of room here because this support
brace actually prevents you from routing
cables across it I would have liked for
Silverstone to have somehow somehow
improve that but there you go so we did
manage to get most of our cable routing
done and of course a sleeved modular
power supply makes a really big
difference because we only have to have
these cables connected to it which is
going to keep the bottom much tinier
than it would have otherwise being we've
actually disconnected quite a few of the
cables here so we're getting close to
the end of our water cooling adventure
as with any liquid-cooled build you can
make whatever plans you want but a lot
of the time you end up changing little
things here or there so we actually
rotated the swift tech block
hold on which sides threaded on you here
there we go that's right inside we
rotated at 90 degrees so that we'd have
our inlet on the top so that we could
get an easier run to the what will be
the outlet on our reservoir so it's
going to go up above the dominators
there then that also gives us a nice
clean straight run from this guy to this
guy this one was really tight and was
kind of hard to get in there but overall
I think it's gonna look really really
sharp so here we are putting our hose
clamps down on the very base of the Barb
there and then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna grab the swift tech screws
right here and we're gonna clamp those
babies down so those will look just
black and stealthy with the included
fittings on the radiator as well as the
pump and then we're using compressions
on the other ones to make those ones
look really clean as well and looks like
we actually haven't found that yet other
than that oh yeah so we've routed the
cables for the video card itself so
those are going to go here again nice
and stealth cables we've also started
cable tying things
make them a little bit more clean and
we're getting really close to the end of
this build here the liquid cooling
tubing's have been routed so you can see
one of the things to be really careful
of is when you're using these clamp
while these plant clamps you want to
make sure only one side is threaded so
you want to make sure that you're gonna
be able to access it with the
screwdriver so we had to take the
dominators out to get at the ones on the
CPU block / pump unit we have some very
tight runs here I don't like to cross to
being a liquid cooling build it's just
one of those like it's one of those faux
pas type things where it doesn't quite
look as clean but I think overall it
kind of worked in here because we do
have very very short runs which is part
of what makes a water cooling build look
optimal as well you want very very short
short runs and I mean I think the only
things that I could complain about with
this particular machine or maybe the
short graphics card I wish we had kind
of a longer graphics card so it looked a
bit more a bit more beastly but other
than that I mean it's it's really really
really sharp and I'm very very pleased
with it so we're gonna go ahead and fill
it now we did change our minds about
filling it first then putting the whole
thing in there I'm glad we did because
that did make it a little bit easier to
deal with overall so filling it is just
going to involve taking out this rad and
then setting up a power cord here so
that we can power cycle in order to
circulate water through the loop and
then keep topping up the radiator as we
go we also still have to run SATA cables
but other than that we're pretty much
done so guys this is it this is where we
reveal what this project was actually
for here's a little tour of our steel
series themed gaming dens set so we're
gonna be doing some steel series on
boxing's as you can probably tell from
all the boxes that are here so we've got
a bunch of cool stuff we've never looked
at before like some variations of the
Siberia v2 s a new sensei as well as
their apex raw that's something I'm
actually really excited to check out we
saw that for the first time at CES
I've also hinted on Twitter about this
so we actually got a steel series vinyl
wrapped custom gaming desktop sort of
table here that I think is absolutely
stunning you can get this done for about
500
bucks to get a custom printed vinyl and
then have it wrapped around a table if
you can find someone you know who does
it which i think is just freakin sick
and just you know I mean you don't have
to put SteelSeries logos on it but you
can put whatever you want it would just
kind of actually the look it makes the
overall desk look so much cooler so
right so our rig is done I meant to
mention this before but we never
installed an optical drive because we
intend to use an external optical drive
for our optical needs because we don't
really use it all that often and then
it's time to power it up so I want to
add some more lighting effects still but
oh I forgot to plug it in but this is
what it looks like for now just with the
Dominator light bars in there as well as
some glow from the LED fans that are
that are around the edges there can you
see that okay try and get a little bit
less less glare maybe from this angle a
little bit but yeah overall I'm
extremely pleased with this build it's a
wicked looking like gaming den build and
oh is it still charging now let's tilt
all right it's still recording oh here
why don't we move that alright oh we
can't move it much so that was all the
moving it alright so that gives you guys
a pretty good look at what it looks like
inside we've also got a really sweet
glow coming out of the top grills here
because those LED fans are right up
against the grilles and the rads are on
the inside if you wanted to see the
finished insides which I don't remember
if I showed you in the last shot or not
looks pretty good in there - I know I
said a lot about how the cable
management of the TJ 10 isn't really
optimal but I think you guys will find
that in spite of that we ended up with a
very very clean looking interior aided
in a big way by these sleeved cables
here that are available as an upgrade
for the strider 1000 evolution so
stunning build actually this is a really
good angle - from slightly over more
that way there you go so big thanks to
Silverstone for helping us with this TJ
o7 build and I'm looking forward to
bringing you guys lots of cool videos
