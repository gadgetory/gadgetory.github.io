you're a performance fiend is pretty
darn good in spite of the iMac pros
woefully inadequate cooling but come on
Apple is this really the fastest Mac
that money can buy yeah Mac Pro I'm glad
I asked because in fact no no it is not
how do we know because we and by we I
mean mostly that guy built the real
fastest Mac on the planet for ourselves
and it's time for us to take it for a
little spin speaking of things I don't
want to break this transition to our
sponsor private Internet access that's
exactly what you'll get with PIAA a safe
and protected IP and it's got loads of
other features as well check it out at
the link in the video description
okay so let's begin by going over what
we've done here this is our a soos
Dominus extreme motherboard and hanging
off of it we actually have wait is that
two power supplies yeah even though the
thousand watts see sonic Prime it's on
my bench right now has more than enough
wattage to handle all of this yeah the
actual load of all these VRMs during
power up it's just way too much for
trips the protection and I had to put
the second power supply on there
speaking things we needed to do we
needed to go with RGB memory of course
right well of course yeah so it's not
ECC but it does support it if we wanted
it okay and instead it's just six
matching sticks of ddr4 3000 which is
faster than the 2666 we have in our hi
Mac Pro we could go faster but we don't
have that many matching sets lying
around so you mentioned that we could go
with ECC memory and that's because the
CUDA grass is that underneath this
knocked to AU 14s cooler here is the
biggest baddest Xeon w workstation
processor on the market the 28 core 56
thread 31 75 X which means that we've
actually got a solid 20 more threads on
our system than we do on our upgraded
iMac Pro and what's more not only do we
have more RAM slots than our iMac pro by
a factor of two we can also add more
modern graphics cards like our Radeon 7
here so just to be clear ties we have
crushed the iMac Pro in every possible
performance metric but that Radeon 7
does mean that we needed to get the
latest version of Mac OS working yeah
that was a pain to get running and
before I talk about it I just want to
stress that this is not a tutorial so
first I used Fox let's new Mac OS simple
KBM as a jumping-off point after trying
a couple of different approaches
my including running Linux logical
volume arrays with octane acceleration
which didn't work I eventually settled
on the current set up 27 cores 54
threads 42 gigabytes of RAM and 2 1
terabyte Samsung 970 pros in Apple raid
mirror because apparently this wasn't
complicated enough for me it was now
unfortunately while I wanted to piss
that up obtain the reason that didn't
work is because the Mac OS installer
straight-up refused to boot with opting
in that even our SSD 800ps that I tried
to use so so just with obtain anywhere
in the system the Mac OS installer is
just like alright
ok then other than that it was pretty
much a standard install yeah basically
there's some extra setup and some
pitfalls with running Apple raid on
Mojave but I worked through them and got
the latest beta installed they ended up
doing direct pass-through of not only
the 2 970 pros but also the kawatche a
10 gigabit Nick that's in here and our
Radeon seven and all of it just works
because it's all got drivers in the
hobby all right so I think we've teased
you guys enough at this point let's see
some benchmarks so why don't we start
with a staple Apple benchmark Geekbench
for okay so our iMac pro got a very
respectable multi-threaded score of over
53,000 but our hackintosh creamed it by
over 20,000 points to put that in
perspective that's almost as much as
adding an entire core I nine MacBook Pro
to the mix and when we look at OpenCL
and metal performance
ok so that's interesting here our Radeon
seven worst performance than the Vega 56
in our iMac Pro now given that when we
threw the Radeon seven on the iMac Pro
we've got similar numbers it looks like
aside from yes losing some of our
performance thanks to overhead from our
hypervisor the Radeon sevens isn't
optimized for whatever Geekbench is
throwing at it here
I mean I guess that's why this version
of Mojave is in beta to further
investigate then we wanted to fire up
another GPU test so let's hit it with
lux mark now that's not bad
now we've at least doubled our
performance over the Vega 56 which is
quite impressive considering that the
Radeon seven is a 64 CU part and
considering that our imac pro gets the
same level of performance out of a
Radeon 7 when connected via an external
enclosure so again this seems to point
to driver optimization rather than raw
performance now let's change gears here
and go ahead and hit our CPU with some
good old-fashioned Cinebench three two
one go this is not even going to be a
fair fight
not really no there are so many extra
threads on this thing so to be clear we
actually gave up a full hyper-threaded
core for our host Linux operating system
but that still leaves us with a very
significant performance advantage
compared to the 18 core iMac pro not to
mention that our base clock is actually
much higher which for a heavily threaded
workload like this one makes a huge
difference okay we're done nearly 11,000
in Cinebench are 20 and are you even
done I just finished 6,800 then we were
over a third faster than the fastest
computer that Apple sells with Mac OS
with that said though if we look at
single threaded performance in cinah
bench the Achilles heel of our xeon
shows up because it's got so many cores
intel had to do some careful tuning of
the power profiles of this thing and our
fastest boost clocks
are much lower than the iMac pro's which
means that without overclocking we'll
always be at a disadvantage in these
kinds of single threaded workloads
that's a bit of a bummer but hey
overclocking on this platform does
actually happened to be a thing for now
though let's move on to some more
testing let's fire up blender and give
that a go
all right ready set it's so funny so you
have to be the one that actually does
all the work to build this thing but
then when we're like drag racing I get
to drive it well I got to drive the
faster one last time so that's true you
did actually I noticed that it's not
actually a competition we're just we're
just thrilled this thing works at all
it's interesting there's actually not a
whole lot of air coming out back here
like there is but it's like not super
high you say that as though you don't
know that's just iMac things yeah but
this cooler is a lot better than the
iMac is it an aqua okay that would be a
fun video Oh cutting open the back of an
iMac and just going like full like you
know muscle car hood scoop like yep yep
is that a video do you guys want to see
that anyway in the meantime let's get
back to this blender was not a good time
for our poor iMac Pro we are just over
40% faster with our hackintosh on both
the BMW and classroom test which is
actually what's weird is this is better
than you'd expect
looking at the thread-count alone and
again that's our higher base clock in
action here finally let's round out our
testing with a little bit of handbrake
so we fired up a floatplane video here
and we're gonna go ahead and use our l
TT fast preset let's face it the small
head start a head isn't gonna make a
difference at the end of it nope
so here's the thing even though there's
diminishing returns when it comes to
h.264 transcoding and adding more course
our hackintosh still pulls off a very
respectable forty second lead over the
imac pro bringing us then to our final
test Final Cut Pro
now that is the only actual clear loss
for our hackintosh today as it turns out
final cuts background renderer is not
highly threaded and is very bursty that
is to say it results in regular spikes
of CPU utilization which means then that
our iMac pros higher boost clock wins
the day by a wide margin and it only
adds up as more and more of those spikes
have to happen on our Xeon w31 70 X
again something we could potentially
overcome with some overclocking before
we go any further though we need to do
something to validate our approach here
because in theory you're not losing a
ton of performance using virtualization
at most you know one to three percent
but we don't have any real-world
validation of this so what we need to do
is shut this down and compare the
results that we just got in Mac OS to
our bare metal hardware running in
Windows and as many cross-platform
benchmarks as we can find to see how big
the differences unfortunately when we
did this testing it was all over the
place even with the two extra threads
that our bare metal machine has
available so on Windows occasionally
we're eclipsing our Mac OS score in CPU
tests like our handbrake transcode and
in Cinebench but then our Windows
machine drops off significantly in
blender and v-ray which you would think
would be very similar benchmarks to
Cinebench as for our more GPU focused
tests like what's mark well that shows
that there is a bit of performance left
on the table even with direct pass room
although this again could be down to
drive your optimization yeah it kind of
smells to me like it's a little bit of a
scheduler issue in Windows it's
something we've seen before so
ironically that means our real-world
performance is actually better in the VM
now to be clear we're not
saying that there's magic performance
that you get by running your operating
system in a virtualized environment in
fact quite the contrary
it's just that what we've discovered is
that unless we run this bare metal
hardware as a hackintosh we're not going
to be able to quantify the difference in
mac OS now I'm not saying that's
impossible
it's just that part of the reason that
we had wanted to do it this way with a
VM in the first place was we wanted to
avoid the fragmentation of hardware and
the way that Apple is constantly
updating Mac OS in ways that can brick
compatibility now a VM could still have
the compatibility bricked but at the
very least it's just one set of things
to maintain instead of every motherboard
on the planet anyway bottom line is this
is very experimental right now this is
not something that we're recommending
that you go do for yourselves unless
you've got a ton of time to kill I mean
this motherboard has a market segment
composed of a few dozen people at best
and when Anthony said this was a
complicated setup he wasn't kidding I
like I'm just gonna let this list of
pitfalls and problems scroll by Wow but
there is still even more potential here
because unlike our iMac Pro we can
overclock we can add more memory and if
this GPU slot wasn't dead
we could even add more than one graphics
card to our hackintosh but since support
for the Radeon seven is still as a
filming in beta we're not gonna press
our luck any further than this besides I
think we've got enough future plans for
this that there's another video in here
