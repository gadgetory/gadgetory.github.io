or Core i5 processor and get a free copy
of Rome 2 total war click now to learn
more with all the talk lately about
using pcs as consoles whether it's with
a Windows operating system or with steam
OS there has been quite a lot of
attention given to very small gaming
optimized cases that are also capable of
holding a pretty impressive amount of
hardware so this my friends is actually
a pre-production unit of one of the ones
that people are particularly excited
about this is the still silverstone
raven our v01 and i apologize for all
the fingerprints all over it it's
because i've actually already done a
build inside the thing so we'll start
with the accessories here you get a few
actually you get three of these handy
dandy little magnetic fan filters
Silverstone is a strong believer in the
idea of having positive pressure inside
the case with filtered intakes because
what that means is dust is filter on the
intake and then because you have
positive pressure inside it is passively
being exhausted everywhere else so dust
cannot accidentally be sucked into the
case so we've got one of these for my
top fan and then I only needed one
additional one for the bottom fan right
here but it does come with a third
alright so then let's finish off the
accessories we've got actually the
accessories are kind of neat we have a
little four pin to other more different
to four pins fan adapter so that's for
those dual fans on the bottom you can
see there's an extra PCI bracket because
I already built-in it there's a GPU
support bracket that's actually kind of
clever I just took it out because I
didn't really I didn't really think I
needed it I just have a GTX 670 in there
and then we bought this is actually kind
of neat so check it out we have a raven
logo here on the front but you can
actually pop that bad boy off and you
can run this guy in either vertical
configuration or a horizontal
configuration so it comes with one
that's curved like that hopefully you
guys can see that and pop that on there
and then it is meant to be run this way
so it comes with optional feet you can
either use the large feet so they're all
conveniently labeled labeled back
right front right front left all these
kinds of things and you pop these into
the little things here so the whole
thing sits on nice little rubber feet or
it comes with a different set of rubber
feet there you go
just your standard sticky rubber feet
that you can put on the bottom if you
want to run it in a horizontal desktop
mode you also get all the screws you
need to install your system but of
course a lot of them aren't in there
anymore because I already did that so
let's go ahead and get this bad boy open
only I guess it's showing view of the
sort of the outside first so here you're
going to see ventilation on the
left-hand side all right here you will
see ventilation on the right-hand side
Silverstone's raven's series is known
for breaking new ground as well as for
excellent ventilation creative
ventilation sometimes here we are going
to find a very very small fan it looks
like a sixty millimeter I don't remember
noticing that when I was I yeah that's
from highs from the SFX power supply so
there's your power supply intake as well
as two more fan slots one of which is
occupied by a slim 120 millimeter fan
that is feeding air flow directly to the
graphics card underneath it we find at
the front two USB 3.0 ports front audio
ports as well as reset and power
switches and finally a slim DVD Drive
seeking those have gotten a lot less
expensive in the last few years here so
it's become somewhat of a viable option
at the back we see a bit of a unique i/o
configuration this is actually my first
time using a PCI Express riser card so
in order to achieve this half-height
form factor and yet have a full high
graphics card you can put up to a GTX
Titan in here no problem they have
actually run a riser which you're going
to see out of the PCI Express 16x slot
on the board so you can install the
graphics card sideways that's how many
of those boutique systems like the
iBUYPOWER revolt are achieving this same
feat of fitting a very very cool system
into a very small place so on the top
you see I actually accidentally
unplugged that 120 millimeter fan as I
was taking the system apart so this one
right here sits directly over top of my
CPU area so it is providing nice a fresh
air to not only the CPU right here but
also to my vrm modules as well as to my
memory modules which are hidden away
down there I like the kid way that cable
management is
in this case so the power supply itself
is actually located over here in the
front it's actually a modular power
supply in there but I should try to I
should start taking it apart for you
guys so you can see how the whole thing
fits together but the power supplies
over here which means that all your
cables either snaked through here to
your to your graphics card they go here
to your SSDs so you can actually put two
two and a half inch SSDs right here
there's the optical drive bay is
actually under here yeah so under here
so you can run another one there and
then you can also put additional SSDs
here on this piece right here as well as
here if you had the necessity instead of
a hard drive if I recall correctly I
could be forgetting something though it
was actually a few days ago that I built
this thing so let's start taking it
apart this will be a new way of doing a
case unboxing for me I'm using a fan
text cooler there although you could use
a stock Intel LGA 1150 cooler if you
wanted right now I'm not aware of any
ITX LGA 2011 cooler so the highest-end
configuration you'll be going with in
here will be a core i7 4770k and then
that could be paired with as high-end a
single graphics card as you could
possibly fit alright so we can pop this
baby off I'm going to show you the PCI
Express 16x riser right here so it's
actually a hard PCB so it's a it's a
solid PCB and then that has an
additional riser card plugged into it
here but we're going to we're going to
have to release the PCI Express lock
here we're going to pull this riser card
out first to take this baby apart so
there we go we've released it there come
on out come on out little guy come on
out little guy there we go good job new
guy okay sorry I'm done that now alright
so I'm going to undo this SSD because
this is also quite quite attached indeed
so that reveals how the graphics card
goes in there so there's a series of I
can't imagine that that was the most
efficient way to do this but there's a
series of two more riser cards maybe the
finished product this is an engineering
sample will have a single piece there
but the graphics card plugs in there
that support brace I showed you before
goes on like this so you can basically
adjust it to pretty much whatever
spacing you want you can throw that on
there locks in place and then you put a
screw in there and a screw on the top in
it it holds it it's more of a concern if
you were going to ship the case
somewhere as opposed to if you're just
build it and then and then use it in one
place the way a normal person would you
can see that there's actually quite a
bit of of length here so while you
wouldn't necessarily be able to install
something like an ax soos GTX 780
directs you to do to the additional
height actually that might even fit
that'd be pretty be pretty borderline
though you can definitely handle the
additional length just fine and then
there's something else that I actually
decided not to do for my particular bill
but you can liquid cool the thing so you
can actually put a dual rad down here
liquid cool the graphics card liquid
cool the CPU and then it has integrated
mounting points for a DDC pump so that's
a popular liquid cooling like DIY grade
pump and you would what is it stuck on
there we go and you would mount that to
this cross brace right here instead of
mounting an SSD here so that's
phenomenally cool good thinking
Silverstone they really are they really
do push things forward in terms of good
compact design I mean we've seen this
with the fortress series they're ITX
fortress in particular I think is
outstanding all right so now that's that
side let's go ahead and pull out this
hard drive cage so I can show you guys
how all that went in there all right
I've removed the screws sorry to be
clear there were two screws on either
side I would like to show you guys how
the cable management works here before I
pull the whole thing out though so you
can see the front panel connectors are
over here and I was actually able to
with a little bit of cramming get those
to go around in front of the power
supply and hard drive cage right here
and then I was able to make very good
use of the space here in order to make
sure that the CPU area stayed quite
clear you can also see my 24 pin and
eight pin motherboard connector --zz
have been installed in a very tight
space so we're going to go ahead and try
to come on you can do it there we go
alright so I can show you guys how that
all worked in here we've actually got
six SATA ports on this p8z 80s or ad z87
i deluxe motherboard from Asus rather
although I'm using a right angle
connector here that was just stupid I
just grabbed the first SATA cables that
I could find and sort of route them over
the RAM like that don't do that anyway
let's go ahead and pull this baby out so
first you install Silverstone has
excellent user manuals and they need
them
you have to do the build in a specific
order otherwise it just plain won't work
you have to install the power supply
before the hard drive and then you have
to install that whole thing in there so
anyway you can see the SFX power supply
that has an extension cord that runs
from the back of the case into the
power-on on the power supply so I'll
just show you guys where that is at the
back of the case there and so that runs
all the way around the outside of the
case actually in a very tidy manner and
then the hard drive just kind of well it
screws on there I think that's pretty
much it so that my friends is the RV's
eo1 which we're using for our internal
steam machine it actually has steam OS
installed on it already so I'm gonna
have to put this thing back together now
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and overview of what I think is one of
the most unique and it's an excellent
DIY option if you don't want to buy one
of those pre done super compact machines
and it's very reasonably priced as well
so thank you for checking out this
unboxing liked the video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment and tell us what you thought of
this new approach to case unboxing where
we actually unbilled the system that we
put in it and as always don't forget to
