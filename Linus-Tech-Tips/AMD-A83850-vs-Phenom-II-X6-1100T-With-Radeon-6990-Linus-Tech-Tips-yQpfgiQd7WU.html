I'm going to take the finem 2x6 1100 T
and I'm going to take 2 Radeon HD 6970 s
ok yes yes this is a 69 50 but just to
prove that I have successfully unlocked
the card you can see here both GPUs are
identical under gpu-z so I do have them
performing at 100% 69 70 speeds and I'm
going to be comparing the 1100 T on the
890 FX platform see I've got a crosshair
for formula there and I'm going to
compare it against the a 75 platform and
AMD's new a8 APU so I'm going to find
out what kind of a performance
difference there is between their new
APU platform which does have slightly
higher performance per clock then at
least the Athlon series so it should be
pretty close to a venom - okay in terms
of clock for clock performance but this
is a quad core and on the higher-end
platforms you can get six cores now an
eight cores coming soon so let's see how
this goes I'm going to be testing a
variety of current titles including
Crysis 2 DirectX 11 Witcher 2 dirt 3
fear 3 Battlefield Bad Company 2 and civ
5 don't mind the other things on here
that's going to be for something else
small change to the methodology guys I'm
going to be using my 6990 because Crysis
2 apparently in spite of using the 11.6
drivers the latest profiles and the
latest patch of crisis - including
DirectX 11 and high-res textures still
doesn't work in crossfire go figure so
these are all the runs of crisis - I did
trying to go OK single card multi card
single card oh you guys can't see the
results that I'm bringing up so you can
see that we're getting some pretty good
consistency there in spite of the fact
that I was switching between a single 69
70 and dual 69 70s so I throw the 6990
on there all of a sudden I get 49 point
5 FPS so we're going to stick with that
for our testing so I'll be testing that
against the 1100 T or with the 1100 T
against the a 75 platform so I've got
myself a benchmarking snack bowl
unrelated to that though I have finished
running my tests for the 1100 T which
was here so I'm running on the crosshair
for formula with the 6990 and then on my
other platform I've got the AMD Llano
83854 unning with exactly the same test
bench with the 6990 so I ran a variety
of modern games and what I found is that
with an identical configuration remember
with the APU we're only taking advantage
of the CPU component of it because the
onboard graphics turns off if you
install anything higher-end then about a
shoot what is this Turks I think it's 66
70 so if you install anything higher and
then something that looks about like
this it is going to turn itself off
because it's not going to provide any
additional benefit in dual graphics mode
okay so we're looking at its performance
strictly as a gaming CPU against the
1100 T which is Andy's cream of the
cream now I think you'll find that in
terms of price to performance ratio it's
pretty darn impressive so the games I
tested we're crisis - this is DirectX 11
with the high resolution texture pack so
everything is maxed out in this game in
fact I bring up my little email that I
made for myself outlining all of my
benchmarking settings yeah there we go
okay I don't have Crysis 2 in there but
whatever it's it's all maximum with the
DirectX 11 and the high-res pack
actually no I think I'm that okay give
me set ok sorry guys for Crysis 2 I'm
using all extreme presets and then I'm
running out obviously 1920 by 1080 and
DirectX 11 is enabled and the uber
high-res textures are enabled so for
Crysis 2
the 1100 T performed about 10% faster
than the a8 APU with exactly the same
configuration The Witcher 2 was much
closer it was only about a 5% difference
which is pretty much I'd say within the
margin of error because I am doing game
run throughs I am NOT doing canned
benchmarks on Crysis 2 Witcher 2 fear 3
and Battlefield Bad Company 2 so there
is some variance although I do my best
to
run through exactly the same way every
time now dirt3 was one where the 1,100
tea just blew away the AAP you it
performed about 30 percent better so 25
30 percent better and fear 3 was one
where they were very close so we start
to see a pattern here come in and have a
closer look at the graph so we start to
see a pattern here that says seventy six
point two by the way sorry guys we're
any game that is CPU bound or very
multi-core where is going to perform
better on the 1100 t platform whereas
any game where we're already quite
graphically bound such as The Witcher 2
or fear 3 we're not going to see much of
a difference in performance that'll feel
bad company 2 perhaps due to the
increased CPU load in that game it does
a lot of physics effects on the CPU
performed about 20 22 % better on the
1100 T and finally civ 5 performed about
10% better and sieve 5 I was using a
late game view of a game that I actually
played I have about 40 cities so what I
do is I Center it over one of my cities
and then pull out all the way and see
what the frame rate is in the corner so
thank you guys for checking out my
little gaming performance showdown
between AMD's highest end cpu and then
their new just phenomenal elbows can't
really call it phenomenal because it's
not even if etem whoa that's
mind-blowing right and their new apu so
stay tuned for more apu content around
the 3850 and don't forget to subscribe
