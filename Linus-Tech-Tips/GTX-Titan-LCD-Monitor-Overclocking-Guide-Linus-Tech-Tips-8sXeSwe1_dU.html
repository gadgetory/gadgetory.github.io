videos that I've had to make for you
guys in quite a while how to overclock
your monitor using the Nvidia drivers on
enabled cards so we have a GeForce GTX
Titan in our test bench here running on
a 30-inch 2560 by 1600 60 Hertz monitor
now the thing about 2560 by 1600
monitors is that they only really exist
as sixty Hertz panels because the
manufacturers own Z reduces them like
that also it's a bit of a DVI dual link
limitation we're led to believe that
allows you to only drive 60 frames per
second or 60 Hertz it's kind of the same
thing in this context but it isn't at
2560 by 1600 so we'll have a seat and
I'll show you guys a cool little trick
all I have to do is go into the advanced
settings within the display
configuration here go to monitor and
boom
what are these options not just 60 Hertz
but 70 Hertz 80 Hertz now normally in a
situation like this where you hook a
monitor up to your graphics card the
graphics card reads the codes on the
monitor that says I am a 60 Hertz
monitor I run at 60 Hertz like a robot
that's how they would talk that's how I
monitor talks so what it does is it
reads that information and then it locks
everything down so it would only say 60
Hertz so why do I have additional
options what I've done is I've gone into
the Nvidia control panel on an enabled
card I've gone to change resolution and
I have created myself customized some
custom resolutions here now like all
overclocking this may adversely affect
the reliability of your monitor you are
overclocking the electronics inside the
panel to speed it up to get more frames
per second more well no not very well
you are getting more effective images
per second why don't I say that images
per second because then it's kind of the
same thing you are speeding it up so it
can adversely affect reliability it
could adversely affect your warranty if
the manufacturer found out that you did
that or if you know you're honest with
them about it so all you really do is
you try things so you go okay I'm going
to create a custom resolution now I
tried creating one at 90 Hertz like any
overclocking there's no guarantees that
things are going to work so you can put
in your heart
on pulling vertical pixels your refresh
rate your color depth your skin type
progressive is what you guys are going
to want to use and all of the timing
stuff I would just probably leave to
automatic now you can see here 90 Hertz
isn't going to work
wallets this is waiting I'll explain to
you guys why you want to do this so if
you buy a high-end graphics card maybe
you buy a geforce gtx titan it's
probably going to run all your games at
higher than 60 hertz
and unless you buy a 3d monitor you
can't get one that runs higher than 60
hertz unless it's a CRT these days so
why am i running games at 100 frames per
second if my monitor can only show me 60
of them that's why you might want to
overclock your monitor because that way
the monitor can actually show you in the
case of this monitor it doesn't run 90
so it went black so we go okay cancel
we're not going to create that
resolution and instead we are going to
stick with the ones we have I've gone as
high as 82 so that's what this one does
rather than push it right to the limit I
would go ahead and I'd go back into my
event settings and I would apply that 80
Hertz profile it makes a tangible
real-world difference in the fluidity of
the motion and unlike 3d monitors which
are TN panels this is a VA panel you
could do it with an IPS panel
potentially again no guarantees how far
your monitor will go some will go
further some will go less far and you
don't see any image quality degradation
so with a TN panel you're going to have
very shot now that it's not hooked up to
anything but you don't have very deep
colors you don't have very accurate
colors by overclocking an IPS or a VA or
some other kind of pls panel something
along those lines you can end up with a
monitor that still looks good and
delivers more fluid movement then a 60
Hertz monitor can so that 100 FPS or 80
FPS that your video card is capable of
outputting isn't going to be as
bottlenecked by the monitor because of
this overclocking option so I say kudos
to Nvidia for allowing the enthusiast to
do this by unlocking it at the driver
level and I think that pretty much
concludes this video thank you for
checking out this I was about to say
unboxing but it's unboxing all monitor
overclocking don't forget to subscribe
