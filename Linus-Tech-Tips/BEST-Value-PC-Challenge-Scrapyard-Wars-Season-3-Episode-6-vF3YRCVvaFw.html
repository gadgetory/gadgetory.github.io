brought to you by deep brand all right
scrapyard Wars day 3 our internet is
down basically we're upgrading to one
gig and I don't know how many of you are
Canadian or have heard of Telus but
they're sort of legendarily terrible and
there was apparently some kind of data
entry error while they were changing our
internet yeah I guess they were probably
typing with their faces as usual so that
kind of probably hampers me a lot more
than anyone else which really sucks
because now we're supposed to be the
time that I was finishing downloads and
installs so I guess what I'm going to do
now is try to install everything onto
the board which is actually what I
wanted to do later but whatever this is
ridiculous but it works whoo cheers
DisplayPort no signal oh good call so
let's get the graphics card out of thee
of the equation oh oh I saw something
flash like half a second yes we have
video ok ok guys ah that's kind of what
I was afraid of that 4 pins probably not
gonna be enough to keep the CPU fed
like I expected I would things not
really tall enough because I didn't take
into account the height of the velcro
okay well that's good it's mounted and
it's still posts so ha that's that's a
good sign so we moved where we were if
you didn't notice because it will
hopefully be better for filming reasons
or whatever yet but we should be
theoretically sitting at about three
gigahertz
and I think our memories still at about
720 mega
so if you is running at three point
three point two four gigahertz
I must have screwed up but I made it
faster than I expected and it's not
crashing
might need a bigger pilot hole but we're
gonna see the wood was not super happy
about that I can't wait for the comments
on this oh my god Luke you did that so
wrong I literally have no idea what I'm
doing I really don't know if this is
gonna help me tie the fishing line at
all I was hoping these were grippier
than my skin but I don't know if that's
true anymore
oh it does totally can be true that's
awesome okay that's good
if this overclock works honestly I'd be
happy I think with this overclock and
the overclock that I have on the CPU
but I'll have about three hours left so
what I need to do is save this overclock
to a profile I already have my CPUs
overclock safe to a profile and
hopefully doing a little bit more cable
management stuff just to make it look
better even though that's not a metric
it would be nice they sync off apply
it did not like that
okay after the benchmark ran it crashed
and I don't know why it crashed so what
I need to do now is figure out if it was
my GPU or if it was my CPU thanks so
what I just did was I changed my overall
total power limit from a hundred and
fifty percent to a hundred and twenty
five percent and I changed my applied
voltage from a hundred millivolts to 50
millivolts whoa what okay like GPUs not
very happy right now
it's not hot and because we have a
voltage or something okay so I turned
things down and they're actually running
faster so at 310 dollars
I just got damn why does it keep doing
that at the same part after like the
same amount of time okay so after some
troubleshooting I think I know what's
going on so we instead of using our two
like really crappy power supplies we're
using one power supply that's somewhat
decent and this is now powering the
graphics card and it's got eight pins to
the CPU so the eight pin was absolutely
the problem the four pin it was enough
to get it to post but it's not enough to
actually do anything
so the CPU I feel like as good as long
as we have an eight pin we've now
switched on the power supplies so that
the graphics card has its own dedicated
power supply the power supplies enough
to spend the fan fully up that's good so
we're still using the four pin it's not
going to be stable whatsoever but this
is more to just see if our two power
supplies yes it's posted okay we're in
business
we're in business so the only thing we
basically need to do right now is get
the four pin to four pin plus molex
adapter okay success we have the one
tiny adapter that costs seven dollars
that we needed so with our new eight pin
we can see that the CPU is boosting up
to like 3.6 gigahertz or so and it's
coming back down but it seems to be
working look at this we're stable 100%
and with only the four pin this
immediately crashed oh no
memory management no it didn't do
anything it's just as unstable as with
the four pen oh no maybe it's the power
supply maybe they're just this this 300
watt supply is just not enough to power
it okay so basically right now we've
swapped out remember we bought with some
other memory just to see if it's the ran
the problem um I mean this is a brand
new state this is like the only brand
new component the built so be really
weird if this was the part that didn't
work this is longer than it was before
the memory may have been the issue we
may have got some defective brand new
memory Wow the only other thing we can
think about is trying this RAM in a
different slot so I'm going to start
stress tests so it only lasted like five
seconds before Wow is this gonna be
stable was it literally just changing
the slot on the motherboard yes dude
high five
you're us okay at this point let's tear
this stuff down oh no we should probably
a game let's play a game okay oh yeah
yes uh which one thing with this build
something is rear with is motherboard it
freaks out every single oh yeah so we
have to go return this memory because
it's broken and it just fell out that's
awesome
two o'clock we have less than two hours
to make sure this works and build the
whole computer get benchmarks ready we
do not have another opportunity if this
does not work we might just be out of it
Oh
coming down to the wire scrapyard Wars
we'll be right back after these messages
this episode of scrapyard wars is
brought to you by D brand makers of the
precision cut vinyl skins that you'll
see on the phones and notebooks of our
contestants they offer a wide variety of
styles and colors and support for the
coolest devices including the
PlayStation 4 galaxy note 5 and iPhone
6s protect the body of your devices and
make them look great at v-- brand.com
slash scrapyard wars ok she posts tis a
good sign
well either our motherboard has two dead
PCI slots or our sound blaster Audigy 2
is dead fortunately we grabbed the
couple sound cards at the time so let's
go ahead and try another one so our
Internet's down at the office this
morning which has made progress a little
slower than I'd like but there is good
news I've got Windows 7 installed my
graphics card seems to be working for
the most part although I haven't run
anything 3d yet because I don't have
drivers for it at the moment there's
some bad news though both my Audigy to
which I had high hopes for and my Sound
Blaster live are dead so I will have to
accept that I will be running a system
that only has HDMI audio oh whoa
oh he said over up we're up Internet's
up yay so this is exciting because I am
many hours away from competition crunch
time and I've got almost all of my
benchmarks installed all my drivers
installed I can start getting baseline
readings and then tuning things and
finding out how
is from there okay 76 5 FPS average I'm
feeling a little tense today it's 12 I
haven't started my build yet and this
initial sin avenge run is really ugly
like if those guys ran out and got a
3770k or something like that they'll be
pulling off triple my score thanks to
the improved architecture
hyper-threading and at least unlike
austin i'm not running around picking up
components now because i'm fairly
certain they did not go for lunch so for
the benefit of our competitor over there
I'm gonna do a quick run-through of all
the awesome components that I've got
over on my side first this gaming grade
motherboard look at that that's a gaming
sound it can be pac-man nope nope nope
nope nope next up we have the finest
power supply ever made I mean it was a
miracle that I was even able to find
these let alone afford it with my budget
next up this genuine USB 2.0 4 port
expansion card and 56k modem gonna need
one of these I don't want to tell them
about that though it's my secret weapon
massive cooler or like wicked
overclocking until 750 series PCI
Express SSD we didn't even pay for that
and this put the 750 series SSD down
again
yeah that doesn't really sound right I
don't think that's a 750 series SSD blah
blah blah I'm just standing over here
lying about what computer parts I have
my name is Linus my voice isn't quite
that high let's put one of our 750
series SSDs away for now guy up - I
always had to
so this is actually broken fortunately
we have so much extra hardware that
literally half of our parts could be
broken and we would have no problem
whatsoever so I'm just gonna go get
another one alright so just in case I
brought some of our extra extra hardware
that isn't the stuff that we actually
need you know right now just installing
our bolt on Hemi they're lying to us and
we were so honest with them about the
computer that we're building you don't
believe that I have a heavy well I did
believe you I wanted to believe I was
just moving stuff around to try to do
cable management and the computer froze
up hopefully that's not actually a
problem it's probably just random old
hard drives and stuff
my computer straight answer we've
probably anymore I don't no idea what
happened it blue screen randomly and now
it does properly I'm pretty disappointed
so we just went from our game benchmark
acting weird to our computer completely
not turning on to our computer turning
on but now Windows is freaking out and
super unhappy
I moved the graphics card down one slot
because free geek Vancouver said that
that top slot wasn't working I had no
problems with that top slot working but
I'm just trying to minimize issues at
this point because there's about three
hours to go and I'd really want to be
running all of the benches that I have
to run and know what my scores are going
to be before I walk into the final so
I'm in the process of building my troll
system which has all of the worst of
every component that I have like this is
like legit like one of the most stress
moments my whole life that's a slight
exaggeration there like I'm super
hardcore stressed right now oh man did
do we actually do it I don't know get my
hopes up right now but like this looks
good this is the only CPU intensive test
if it finishes this that pretty much
means that we're good nothing else
should hit the CPU this hard for this
long alright we're business dude that's
awesome
oh look at that like butter Wow
it's perfect it's actually not that bad
everything else has just been like
typical sort of like random computer
problems like dead memory or like not
having the right adapter or whatever but
if it works together we did a great job
it is terrible but you just literally
told me to do this like five seconds ago
and I agreed what have we done dude this
is not cool have we done you you're
right thirty seconds ago you were taking
credit like this is all Austin that
we're such a great team then we actually
see what it is like I have nothing to do
with this thing the greatest thing ever
Terral taste looks fine there's a lot of
it but it looks fine oh my god yeah
there's still gunk in the CPU socket
that could super be what it is oh wow
it's currently 226 meaning assuming it's
2:30 we've got an hour and a half left
so if that was the problem I think I'm
still doing ok if that wasn't the
problem
I could be totally screwed at this point
my computer doesn't make it through fire
strike if I completely fail a benchmark
I'm done so right now we're testing CPU
overclock only no GPU overclocked we
just did a successful fire strike run
completely all the way through with no
overclock that were testing 3.24 on this
guy oh I can't believe it just crashed
I feel like sick like I don't feel good
at all if that just crashed because of
the overclock that's fine if that does
crash for any other reason I'm screwed
so as of right now if I apply literally
any amount of overclock my CPU like
memory or my graphics card even one at a
time I can't really benchmark
I'm fifty gigs isn't right oh is 150
card try
oh no it's not big enough we only have
100 th hard-driving there's a 200 gig
SSD we have to install Windows from
scratch because we don't have any way of
finding window we don't have time oh
yeah I've got it you makes it awesome we
have a flash drive oh you sure you tell
me that I did oh and upstairs thank you
I'm gonna be slightly late so Lesley
you're having yours a lot okay so our
CPU temperatures are well within reason
and we're going to do some stability
testing at 3.2 gigahertz and go back and
work on our tool system here we go
I don't know if our tool system is going
to end up working I have tried to get it
to post I've tried to separate
motherboards and honestly we're at the
point now where I don't have a ton of
extra time to spend on it so I'm still
going to go over there and like be
working on it from time to time but I'm
probably better off focusing right now
on my main system because I only have an
hour and 40 minutes to dial in a GPU
overclock and mod the case and building
it those are the three main mods make
the motherboard fit make the power
supply fit I guess that's only two with
a couple of drill holes um we can make
this work now here's something that I
actually
sort of forgotten about need to make
sure that this baby is going to fit
which so far is looking like a bit of a
no-go
I've never trusted this kind of standoff
so it's fine
but I'm going to tape over them just in
case I cannot afford to kill any more
components at this stage in the game
so apparently overclocking my CPU but
not applying voltage kind of worked
overclocking my GPU and not applying
voltage no not even like a little bit
barely got into that pinch at all so
we're going to reset the graphics card
overclock just run it at stock whatever
so there's nine minutes left I'm just
gonna set it to the last overclock that
worked - stop I'm done okay so Windows
is installing right now basically after
this we need to install our benchmarks
we need to do the start hi what's up
next time on scrapyard wars Austin
becomes a wizard - doesn't have to cheat
but he does Luke's house burns to the
ground and that's all come see it
next time on scrap yards away yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
