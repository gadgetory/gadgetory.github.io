gigs of RAM I found an article on BCC
hardware comm and they are talking about
24 gigs of ram and detection on the ass
rock X 58 supercomputer and they said
that they had to enable a an option in
the BIOS called the flexibility option
in order to see all 24 gigs of memory so
I'm going to go ahead and see if I can
find anything in the bios of the rampage
3 extreme like a flexibility option that
will enable me to detect all 24 gigs of
this ram 16 gigs is a very strange thing
to be locked out I mean I already looked
for it but I didn't find anything last
time and it's based on what I'm reading
it's got to be in there somewhere one
thing I've noticed is the post takes
quite a bit longer with 24 gigs around
it's not a problem the system is stable
but that does just take a little bit
longer I also tried this stuff at 1600
megahertz c9 c10 1.6 5 volts max and I
was not able to have any success setting
that up so I figured hey it's worth a
shot right so why don't we just go
through kind of one by one so CP level
up if you level up that's just automated
overclocking sync mode okay so this
allows you to use okay not going to be
relevant to what we're doing why don't
we set the overclocked tuner to manual
okay so see from CPU level up okay so
that's what we already saw before it
just went and moved it on us CPU ratio
setting CPU configuration maybe it's in
here
no we already looked in here they need a
20 M speed step
I do not see anything in here that even
looks remotely like what we need all of
these frequency settings Oh memory
configuration protect maybe that's what
this does okay let's try it because I
remember looking at this one last time
in it to me that looks like a lot of the
time you have to actually enable
overclocking features like if you like
you know see how I set it to manual and
all of a sudden I had options for like
setting the CPU multiplier stuff like
that I thought that that was just to
prevent you from changing Ram timings or
something but you can see that whether
that was enabled or disabled I still had
those same memory options so why don't
we see if that is what prevent is
preventing us from seeing all 24 gigs of
RAM see if I can kill some more time
while we're booting up good thing I have
an SSD oh look and a knife so I could
open boxes speaking of opening boxes
here are some unboxings that I have
coming up soon HyperX Ram fan couple
Kingston SSDs one of which I will be
giving away so stay tuned and then I've
got a crew the master notebook cooler
and then there's a rampage three extreme
box down there so you've seen that
already alright let's see what we got
here
task manager yes there we go
we have 24 gigs of ram so that was in it
was that the protect option that enabled
us to have access to all 24 gigs of
memory so why don't we see if our blend
is still staying you know it's funny I'm
gonna have to find a new memory testing
program because even using prime95 blend
I can't I can't even touch I can't even
touch the RAM
we've still got 20 gigs of memory free
so yeah feel free to post a comment
under this video if you have any
suggestions for a way to actually stress
24 gigs of ram other than running men
test for like the three days it would
take to do a couple of passes thanks for
checking out my video blog don't forget
