click now to learn more this video ended
up being less about the Plextor m6e SSD
specifically and more to do with what it
represents in general
finally a move away from the longtime
bottleneck that is the SATA interface
and towards PCI Express 4 system storage
but with a bit of a twist this time
unlike previous plug II solutions like
the OCZ Revo drive which used a RAID
controller as a middleman between the
PCI Express controller on your CPU or
mother board and the SATA controllers on
multiple drives that were soldered onto
a PCB something that caused long boot
times no support for the trim command
and port compatibility aside from being
something you could set up just as
easily yourself this new approach uses
native PCI Express all the way through
to the controller on your drive elegant
a well ok so this product doesn't look
particularly elegant but don't worry
this PCI Express card that the daughter
board sits on is basically nothing more
than a dumb interconnect between your
PCI Express slot and the m dot 2
interface SSD that's sitting on it here
electrically it's just a straight pass
through so elegance isn't always about
looks am I right before we get into the
m60 specifically though it's probable
that you've never actually seen an m dot
to drive before so let's do a quick WTF
is that session here this interface on
this motherboard here might look pretty
much like an M SATA or mini PCI Express
slot but it's actually much more badass
than that it gives whatever is plugged
into it access to up to 4 PCIe gen3
lanes a SATA 3 6 gigabit port and even
USB the card side of the interface is
designed from the ground up for the best
possible ratio of features to physical
space making it a great way to get
desktop great performance on ultrabooks
and other small thin and light devices
cards can be designed in a number of
lengths and widths with most of them 22
millimeters wide just wide enough for a
flash chip and they can tap into
whatever
nation of connectivity they need
including PCI Express SATA and SATA
Express which is basically a HDI
commands over a PCI Express bus using
the new 3.2 standard you'll be able to
tell what your card needs by the keying
on the bottom of the connector which
leads us pretty well into the m6e it
uses two PCI Express Gen 2 lanes for a
theoretical max throughput of 1000 Nega
bytes per second or about 60% more than
SATA 3 6 gave it it's 80 millimeters
long and 22 millimeters wide with 8 of 2
Sheba's 90 nanometer toggle NAND flash
chips and a Marvell 91-83 native PCI
Express controller that uses HDI
commands instead an nvme to offer
improved compatibility and driverless
operation at the cost of some
performance particularly in random
workloads
now while plex stirs product page
laughably declares it to be the first
SSD optimized for gamers the speed of
this drive with their custom firmware is
pretty impressive the 256 gig model that
we have here can handle sequential write
speeds of around 580 megabytes per
second and sequential reads of around
770 megabytes per second well over the
maximum of SATA 3 with random reads and
writes both rated at around 100,000 I
UPS now beyond that Plex Terr does
include some extra technologies
including native UEFI boot support for
faster drive initialization and boot
times on ufi motherboards as well as
their usual true speed garbage
collection algorithm that helps it
maintain its performance over time and a
five-year warranty to go along with the
claims about you know outstanding
reliability that they make now speaking
of those claims Plex tur takes an
interesting approach here while another
manufacturer a very reputable one I
might add asked me not to talk about
their use of flex our SSD testing
chambers Plex tur where's this right on
their sleeve and calls out their driver
liability testing standards right on the
product page and it's for this reason
that the lines tech tips comm form uses
a Plextor SSD as its boot drive there
are only a handful of SSD makers that I
would trust in such a deployment so
there you have it
while the m6c is very expensive features
a
frankenstein-like implementation and in
the real world due to microsoft's poor
native windows 8 HCI driver and some
other early adopter struggles doesn't
really perform better than a normal SSD
it is the first native PCI Express SSD
I've had the pleasure of laying my hands
on and I'm excited for the future of
this new technology speaking of being
excited for the future summer is finally
heating up now you may have noticed my
eyewear changing throughout the video
today I'm actually just going to bring
this up here and that is all thanks to
our new sponsor Warby Parker and the
unusual way that they let their
customers shop for eyewear their free
home try on program lets you shock their
online portfolio of prescription glasses
and sunglasses pick out five frames you
like try them on in the comfort of your
own home you know blast note to your
friends for opinions or whatever else
then box them back up and send them back
with the included shipping box and
included shipping labels free of charge
Warby Parker will then send you a brand
new one of the one that you picked for
the enjoyment of you and everyone else
around you the best part for me is that
the extras are included so there's no
high-pressure upsell anti-glare coated
prescription glasses and polarized non
prescription sunglasses start at 95
bucks with prescription sunglasses
starting at a hundred and fifty dollars
so you can actually get a few pairs of
fashionable well-constructed glasses for
less than what you'd normally pay for
one from a similar quality boutique
brand on top of that they ship a pair of
glasses to someone in need for every
pair that they sell to a customer so
there's a warmer Parker dot-com slash
Linus to check out their new spectrum
Sun collection and as an added bonus if
you use that URL when you do your Tryon
you'll get free three-day shipping on
your final selection so thanks Warby
Parker for supporting Linus tech tips
and thanks to you the viewer for
watching without both of you then this
whole thing wouldn't work and we
couldn't make videos so way to go all of
you as usual guys the link to pricing
and availability for the Plextor m6 is
in the video description below the like
dislike and share buttons which you
should use accordingly also in the video
description is a support link where you
can buy a t-shirt give us a monthly
contribution or change your Amazon
mark so that we get an affiliate
kickback whenever you buy stuff it helps
us out a lot thanks again for watching
and as always don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips for more videos like
this one
like SSDs motherboards sunglasses and
put these back on these studio lights
are actually surprisingly bright it's
much better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
