brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX now we reviewed the rog
Gladius not that long ago the first two
thousand hertz polling rate Mouse there
were some things we liked about it there
were some things that weren't quite
perfect about it yet and we kind of said
okay well as sue still has some work to
do on Mouse development but we're not
counting them out of the game here
because it's a pretty darn good first
effort well they're following up with
some additional stuff right off the hop
here that looks pretty interesting so
this one right here is the sea cow we're
figuring it's gonna be around $40 MSRP
is that sound about right I'm getting
the kind of this sort of gesture it's
gonna feature a 5000 dpi sensor we don't
know exactly which one but we do know
that it's optical it's kind of a no
frills no gimmicks Mouse on the surface
very similar to the very well-regarded G
100's in terms of the ergonomics and the
size and the weight as far as I can tell
with this gigantic piece of plexi it
seems like it's pretty much in that
neighborhood but it comes with some
features that you might not normally
expect so it's got LED lighting on the
back of it and it also features
upgradable socketed switches so while
this one doesn't come with emraan
switches like the Gladius does you can
swap them out if you want very very
easily but that's not the only Mouse
they have coming this is the Sparta and
this is where I need you guys to get
involved because a JJ personally will be
reading the comments on this video and
taking your feedback back to a Seuss HQ
when they decide on how to continue to
develop this mouse so this is gonna be a
wireless sort of MMO MOBA RPG type
optimized Mouse so you've got six
programmable macro buttons on the side
here you've got a couple more to the
left of the left click you've got your
left and right click and then you've got
what appears to be either it's gonna be
a button is that gonna be a dpi switch
yeah that's gonna be a dpi switch up
here at the top you will be able to use
it in Wired mode so all this sounds
pretty good it's going to feature
wireless charging which is pretty
freakin cool so there's a little thing
here it can sit on a stand it can sit
down flat but the big one that they
don't know yet is they're still
evaluating three different sensors
and you know we don't know which way
it's gonna go it could be even laser or
optical so I want you guys to weigh in
what sensor would you like to see and
bear in mind guys that there isn't a
laser sensor on the market that doesn't
have inherent acceleration or other
anomalies if we want something that
tracks one to one we've got to give them
a little proud in the right direction
tell them we want an optical sensor that
doesn't feature any nonsense and just
pure one-to-one tracking a soos please
deliver that for us guys let JJ know
what you want to see speaking of
tracking they've got the ROG whetstone
mousepad this is a little bit unique in
that a it's textured and I kind of went
are you guys high
because textured mousepad mouse pads
with graphics these things have been
very terrible experiences for me in the
past
just because tracking can often be very
jittery and uneven over them but no no
no no hold on a second we actually
revised this quite a few times in order
to get the distance or the like the
height difference between the pattern
and the and the valleys just right so
that not only our mice but other mice
track just awesome across it the other
unique thing about this guy is that
aside from the heat treated edges that
should prevent it from fraying this is
the first silicon mousepad so it's not
just your typical rubber and cloth soft
mouse mat it's silicone so that means a
couple of things number one is it should
be much more durable and number two is
it's going to be completely resistant to
spills even liquids and odors so if you
don't want a stinky mousepad then you
might want to spend yourself probably in
the neighborhood of sort of 35 to 40
bucks on a whetstone
low friction mousepad with durable anti
slip silicone base intricate meiyan
meiyan pattern surface minimizes
friction Mayon pattern alright I love
you guys but sometimes you're sometimes
your marketing bullet points are just
silly
speaking of silly marketing phantom
glass decided to have us tell you guys
about how great their screen protectors
are that's not silly that makes a ton of
sense so basically these are the
clearest screen protectors we've ever
encountered they feel just like the
glass that was already on your phone
there
at resistant and pretty much resistant
to any kind of ugliness you can put your
phone in your pocket with your keys not
worry about it
they're super easy to apply it's
basically impossible to get a bubble
stuck under it and you can check them
out at store dot phantom dot glass we
absolutely love these things around here
they're so low profile because they're
made of the same Gorilla Glass that your
phone already has on the front of it
that you can actually put third-party
cases like this bumper that I have on
without worrying about compatibility
like with other screen protectors where
they might peel up at the edges also
want to give a shout-out to HyperX thank
you so much for allowing us to be here
at the show you guys can check out the
youtube channel to youtube.com slash
HyperX we'll have both of those guys
linked in the video description so huge
thanks for our sponsors thanks to you
guys and make sure you leave a comment
we want an optical sensor in this not
that I'm leading you guys in one
direction or the other thanks for
