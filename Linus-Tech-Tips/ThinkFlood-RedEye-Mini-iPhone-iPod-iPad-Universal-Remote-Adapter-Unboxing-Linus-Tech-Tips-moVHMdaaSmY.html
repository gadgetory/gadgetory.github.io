unboxing of a pretty neat little product
from think flood so this is the red eye
mini this is a new one it's a mini
version of the original red eye which
we're not gonna look at except only
briefly there we're gonna focus on the
mini today so you can see it's pretty
self-explanatory universal remote for
iPhone iPod touch and iPad
well that doesn't actually really
explain much if you don't know what this
product does already so we're gonna do
the unboxing really quickly there it's
unboxed that was it
okay so inside we will find the red eye
mini which is here with the infrared
transmitter on the front of it and then
a headphone jack on the other end that's
it that's the whole thing and then this
is cool check this out so this is what
makes it mini and portable this is a
little carrying case that you go ahead
and you throw on your keychain you know
put that in there and now all of a
sudden your iPhone or iPod or iPad is
now a universal remote that you can
carry with you anywhere pretty neat
okay so let's talk about what makes the
mini cool so first of all it comes down
to their software so the the red-eye
software is something that you can
download for free to your iPod or iPad
it allows you to customize the layout it
allows you to use the full multi-touch
capabilities of the iPod iPad okay I'm
gonna say iPhone because that's what I
have to the iPhone so you can actually
change the channel by scrolling right
change the channel by scrolling left you
can adjust the volume by scrolling up
and down you have the ability to access
their database of codes you can actually
learn from your existing remotes so
before you before you lose them to just
quickly learn it on your on your iDevice
and then you won't have to worry about
finding it anymore ever I think you can
customize the actual button layouts
after no I know you can customize the
button layouts but I don't know if I
said it yet and it comes with its own
carrying case no batteries required and
since it plugs into the headphone jack
you've actually still got access and I'm
just gonna show you guys what it looks
like when you plug it in so it's not the
kind of thing that you'd leave plugged
in permanently obviously but you know
you plug it in to use it
then it actually leaves your charging
port completely unobstructed at the
bottom so you can actually charge it and
then use this at the same time now it
looks like you're gonna have to watch
out for for case compatibility because
this is camera man's iPhone and he's got
a case that looks like it's going to
interfere with plugging it in fully
whereas I'm just using a sticker and
yeah I'm not having any clearance
problems with that so depending what
kind of a case you're using on your
iPhone
that's what its gonna look like with the
redeye mini installed so I'm obviously
gonna have to do some testing with this
device but they advertise that it'll
work
awesome with pretty much any device
including your TV your DVD player your
cable box anything that accepts an
infrared signal from your remote control
so stay tuned for more videos on Linus
tech tips including about this but
unboxings reviews all that good stuff
and I just want to ask you guys a
question
does anybody already have a red eye or a
device like this and if you do what do
you think of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
