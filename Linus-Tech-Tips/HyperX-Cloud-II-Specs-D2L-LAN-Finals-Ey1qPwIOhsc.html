brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom glass for the best
darn screen protectors out there as well
as hyperx welcome to the HyperX d2l
tournament or dota 2 live tournament
this is the finals that i'm at right now
there's a fifty-thousand-dollar prize
bull Brantley is getting pretty awesome
over there if you want to see the vods
for this check out twitch TV / d2l
you'll be able to watch it there now
we're not actually here for the dota 2
tournament we're here for the headphones
that some of the guys are wearing in the
headphones that are round which are the
cloud tues or in some cases cloud once
if you want to see Linus's review on the
cloud ones click somewhere around my
face on the screen i'm not sure where
it's going to end up going but you can
click there to see our review on the
cloud ones these are fairly similar to
the cloud ones the cloud tues have the
same 53 millimeter driver they have a
detachable mike although it's been
improved they have one hundred percent
memory foam which has been improved in a
few areas and is actually very
comfortable overall they have a new
inline dongle sound card which don't
technically have to use if you want to
use the sound card because maybe you
don't have a sound card or something
like that then that's great it goes in
through USB if you don't want to use the
sound card you can just unplug from that
sound card and plug in through 3.5
millimeter no problem whatsoever you can
also plug into something like a
playstation 4 and xbox one a pc mobile
pretty much whatever the heck you want
and these headphones will do completely
fine they also come in three colors red
gunmetal and a limited edition pink and
white which my mom might be pretty
interested in i know i gave her a pink
and white keyboard not that long ago so
having a matching set could be pretty
cool and they're also teamspeak
certified which is pretty cool you can
obviously still use it with skype and
all that other kind of stuff but it's
cool to see that it's certified by a
voice company our guys thank you for
watching if you want to see all the rest
