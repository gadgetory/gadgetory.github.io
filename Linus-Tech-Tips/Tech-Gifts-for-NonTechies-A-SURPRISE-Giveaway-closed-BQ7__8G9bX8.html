you've probably made the mistake of
buying your non tech savvy parents or
siblings or friends some kind of
technology or related item as a gift not
because you wanted to punish both
yourself and them but because you wanted
to share your love of cool devices with
the others in your life and then after
spending hours setting it up only to
have them break it in ten minutes
you probably vowed never to do it again
well I have to but this year I found a
tech gift a Sonos connect amp that
solves a problem and genuinely makes
life more convenient for my parents and
is easy for me to maintain so I'd like
to share that story with you and if you
stick around till the end there might be
a fun way for you to check up your loved
ones this year as well
the blasts 4hx headphones from ozone
gaming are compatible with the Xbox 360
Playstation 3 Playstation 4 and PC they
also feature a foldable design inline
control and 44 millimeter drivers check
out the link in the video description to
learn more so my parents used to be tech
savvy I mean at least my mom was I'm
fairly sure my dad still teaches his
classes with an overhead projector but
but seriously we were actually kind of a
tech family in the early days we had a
Commodore 64 I played the crap out of
Marble Madness we even had the joystick
accessory that looked a little something
like this we upgraded to a 386 custom
machine built by Gino at bits and bytes
computer store we were the first on the
block with a 486 with cd-rom whoo and
Carta mixed up mother Goose anyone and I
still remember the feeling of utter
boredom that I felt when my mom
excitedly showed me the box for our
state of the freaking art 14 for kilobit
per second modem and loaded up a web
page to show me how amazing it was for
some research paper she was doing for
her master's degree
we even joined the Pentium era right
early on 200 megahertz with MMX friends
but however it happened my parents went
from the cutting edge to where they're
at today we're like we wanted to do a
video shoot in their house last year and
Brandon asked for some photos of the set
that we'd be using so he could plan and
it took me literally half an hour to get
a picture off of an Android smartphone
and have them send it to me it would
have been faster for me to drive there
so I'm sure you guys can imagine then
and I take at least 40% of the blame for
this the disastrous experience a couple
years ago that was setting up a home
theater system with a projector media
center PC complete with TV capture card
a game console and at one point a
karaoke machine there were so many
remotes that even with the mat that I
created that had like outlines for where
they went and then labels for the
buttons they couldn't figure out how to
use it at the best of times and
diagnosing stuff like that over the
phone is impossible the service calls
every time someone wanted to watch TV
were a burden that no one was happy with
so when my parents moved to a condo and
no longer had room for the projector I
think every
was a little relieved but the a/v
receiver and amplifier and the speakers
lived on as kind of a badass stereo unit
until finally the receiver gave up the
ghost and with their teeth gritted my
first came to me asking how they can
keep using those speakers they spent all
that freaking money on it my
recommendation so that is where this
came in
I reviewed the all-in-one speaker
products in so Knossos ecosystem a while
back and even with daily use I've been
really really pleased with their ease of
use when accompanied by an
all-you-can-eat music service like
google play music but the one thing I
criticized about them at the time
something that really hasn't been
addressed is that the speakers are super
unspecial sounding like especially for
what you're paying for them so the
solution then was the connect amp it's a
compact little white and silver box that
should be easy enough to hide somewhere
discreet that allows you to use your own
stereo or 2.1 speaker setup with the
Sonos ecosystem just plug in the power
cord plug in your speaker's the same way
you would to any receiver or any other
amplifier and follow the exact same set
up guide as the rest of their products
sort of I was actually pleased to
discover that you no longer need the
bridge accessory and everything can
stream to your normal Wi-Fi hotspot so
basically you download the app go
through the Wi-Fi setup setup which room
it's in and boom you're able to listen
to any existing music library songs you
have you can listen to internet radio
through the Sonos app and you can bind
additional accounts so that's what I did
I gifted my parents a Google Play Music
account for six months and then with
that done it took me a matter of five to
ten minutes to show my mom how to use it
my sister even already knew how and it's
times like this that my love of
technology becomes something that I can
legitimately share with others because
while you can make the argument that VLC
or Plex or some command-line tools
somewhere can do everything that a
consumer product like this can do and is
significantly cheaper the reality of it
is that as tech geeks we kind of wrapped
up in the OMG this is so cool it could
do all this stuff and we forget about
the you know companies arriving for a
cocktail party in three minutes and I
need some ambien music why isn't this
working I don't want to reboot a server
so then that's my challenge to you guys
today whatever your story of how you got
into tech is and how ever disconnected
your loved ones are from the
technological world head over to the
Linus tech tips forum thread linked in
the video description with the rules and
full giveaway details and post what
technology gift you would buy for a non
techie up to three hundred dollars and
three lucky winners yes we are giving
away nine hundred dollars worth of stuff
three lucky winners will have their gift
sent to them to the person of their
choice in time for Christmas by me so
merry Christmas everyone on the subject
of things being easy to use tunnel bear
the easy to use VPN app for mobile and
desktop if you don't know what a VPN is
basically all the way tunnel bear
describes this is it lets you tunnel to
16 different countries allowing you to
browse the internet and use online
services as though you are in that other
country so it's kind of like a like a
man-in-the-middle so that the traffic
coming to a website or service be it
Netflix say for example appears as
though it's coming from a given country
which allows you to get around firewall
rules it allows you to well use services
like Netflix and have access to the
library of you know your friends down in
the states who have way cooler shows
than you and all that kind of stuff it's
available on Android iOS Chrome Mac PC
and I think that's pretty much it and
the apps are super easy to use you just
pick the country that you want to be in
and then watch as your bear tunnels your
internet connection to the new location
so when you do that a couple things
happen your connection gets encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switch so you
show up as if you're in that other place
and they fixed all the annoying parts of
using a VPN for personal use there's no
need to mess around with port
configurations DNS or any router
settings tunneled their handles all that
in the background and they give you 500
Meg's of data for free so you can try it
out no credit card required then if you
want to upgrade to unlimited data you
can actually save 10
