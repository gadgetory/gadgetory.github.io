something that's very exciting this is
the Galaxy GeForce GTX 670 it supports a
wide variety of exciting features most
of which you can actually find out about
on my galaxy gtx 680 unboxing as well as
review and all the other videos i did
about it because the 670 is actually
very similar to the 680 in many ways now
sure it doesn't have quite as many cuda
cores it only has 1344 sure it's not
clocked quite as high with a boost clock
that's generally in the neighborhood of
around 980 mega hertz although GPU boost
doesn't necessarily you know nail it
down to an exact frequency at any given
time and sure it might look a little
different and more on that in a moment
but in terms of the performance in terms
of the memory speed in terms of the
memory bus this is the first time in a
while we haven't seen a step down card
from the flagship single GPU that is
actually using the same memory bus at
the same frequency so it has six
gigahertz gddr5 memory with a 256 bit
bus it's using the sig right right right
so the reason that most of the features
are very similar is because it is using
the same GK 104 core that the GTX 680 is
using although slightly cut down in
terms of the functional units the CUDA
cores and the clock speed but other than
that this is almost a GTX 680 although
the key difference is that it comes at a
more attractive price so you can see it
actually looks very similar as well more
on that in a moment
so let's just have a look at what galaxy
includes with their GTX 670 and here we
find slick all black packaging I'm a big
fan of packaging as you guys probably
know if you've watched a few of my
videos like I'm packaged a lot of
products so I do recognize good
packaging when I see it got nice little
individually packaged to Ziploc II
things going on here so we've got a DVI
to vga adapter
we have two dual molex to 6
see id adapter so that probably tells us
that this card uses dual 6-pin pci ii
power adapters as well as a graphics
card driver installation disk although
you should download the latest and
finally a set-up guide easy setup for
quick installation for geforce gtx 680
that pretty much covers it attention
customers thank you for purchasing your
pablo blog be sure to register your card
within 30 days of purchase to receive an
extended warranty so galaxy does provide
up to I believe it's yes three years of
warranty if you extent if you register
your card right away go ahead and later
now let's get to the card itself
so first let's do a brief rundown and
yeah I'm totally gonna look over there
and use my cheat sheet because that's
how I roll of the features that the GTX
670 includes that were first introduced
on the 680 so we've got GPU boost which
means that it dynamically according to
the TDP that is the thermal design
envelope of this particular card as well
as the power envelope is going to adjust
assuming that your GPU is running cool
enough and your board is not consuming
too much power like if you're using
something like fur mark than it would
know that well that's not a real game
and it's drawing more power than as
realistic GPU boost will dynamically
adjust the frequency of your GPU
in order to make the best use of the
power and the heat envelope that it has
available to it so GPU boost is
definitely present on the 670 we also
have FXAA
has been added to the Nvidia control
panel that's accessible to for many
different cards now adaptive vsync is
one that's really cool so adaptive vsync
allows you to either be using vsync when
your framerate is way way above the
refresh rate of your monitor whether
it's 60 or 120 or whatever the case may
be so it will turn vsync on to eliminate
tearing so that is when your GPU draws
the top half of the screen and the
bottom half of the screen in the middle
of a monitor refresh and you see like
there's a guy standing there and he's
like slightly disconnected at the waist
so that's caring so VSIP will turn on
when you're up there and then when you
are below 60 let's
sixty-four are hypothetically most
monitors most LCDs of 60 Hertz when
you're below sixty Hertz it will no
longer have to drop you all the way down
to 30 if your GPU is capable of pushing
55 frames per second which is how these
thing works so it turns vsync off as
soon as you fall below that threshold so
you get the best of both worlds so
that's adaptive vsync TxAA is basically
more what are they what are they what do
they sort of call it pretty much the
performance
avianna see i'm mode one right two times
multi sampling a performance and it
looks like eight times a day so that's
basically bat and then mode two is you
know what hold on you may say I couldn't
read my little chart from too far away
so mode one is the performance hit of
two times anti-aliasing and it looks
about like eight times anti-aliasing and
then mode two looks even better than
that and is about the same performance
hit as four times anti-aliasing so that
is also present on this part next we
have full support for Nvidia 3d vision
surround off of a single card so you can
go one two three displays with an
auxilary display no big deal so you want
to run your three displays and then your
auxilary one can run the game at the
same time it's not for surround gaming
but if you had like you know a chat
window open or like system monitoring
utilities or stuff open on that fourth
monitor then you can totally run that
one as well so up to three plus one
displays is also supported on this card
4k monitor support as well as HDMI 1.4 a
that includes 3d which is very very cool
stuff better physics performance and
we're pretty much there now let's have a
look at the card itself so it uses a
similar blower design cooler which also
includes the acoustic dampening hooha
that nvidia included with the gtx 680
you can see it's a slightly shorter card
although it's more than slightly shorter
which I'll show you more of in a moment
and uses the same fan which is good
because the GTX 680 fan is excellent is
a PCI Express 3.0 card which is good if
you have the latest Ivy Bridge platform
for your system you can see on the back
we've got certain you know more like
plasticy shroud ii thing there's
PCIe interface I already showed you the
two DVI hdmi and displayport connectors
up here we've got cool geforce gtx
branding and then here we've got our two
6-pin PCI connectors and what you may
have noticed about that is it's in kind
of a weird location why would that be
because the GTX 670 comes with a very
short PCB and Vidia has actually rotated
the GPU around to make better use of the
power circuitry being on the the back
half of the card so all your power
delivery is actually here instead of
here so they no longer needed that
segment of the PCB check this out there
you go
so you can see this 670 is a reference
6:17 there's actually extra room for
more graphics memory so you can buy a
670 with up to 4 gigs of graphics memory
and where all that power delivery
circuitry normally is it's no longer
there so they are still using the nice
long efficient blower cooler which is
going to exhaust most of the air out the
back of your case and you can also see
there's a nice big gap between the
heatsink and these these vents back here
which actually allows for slightly
better airflow but they've used a very
very efficient design to achieve that
speaking of efficiency it is by far
better performance per watt than
anything else that NVIDIA has produced
in this kind of a price range before so
it's like I said using the same GPU as
the GTX 680 which means it just blows
away its predecessors the 570 the 470 in
terms of the performance per watt that
this card can deliver it is compatible
with multi Way SLI configurations due to
its two sli it's two sli bridge months
to nasa-like connectors sorry guys I'm
tired and I think that pretty much
covers it so thank you for checking out
