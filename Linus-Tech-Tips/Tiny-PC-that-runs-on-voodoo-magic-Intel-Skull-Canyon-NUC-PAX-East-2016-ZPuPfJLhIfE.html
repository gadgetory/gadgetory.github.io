bringing us to PAX East 2016 this year
if you want to see all of their stuff
click their link in the video
description down below so we are the
Intel booth checking of these skull
Canyon the last time they released
something with the name of skull in it
it was the skull trail and that was
freaking badass and so is this we've
talked about on the LAN show before but
now I finally get to see it in real life
let's check it out
the main awesome thing about the skull
canyon is its size and what it's able to
do within the restrictions of its size
this thing is 0.74 litres of total
volume which is less than two pop cans
for more exact dimensions its 211 by 116
by 28 millimeters not inches or
centimeters millimeters this thing is
tiny in terms of the internal hardware
which is I know what you all want to
hear about it as an i7 6770 HQ processor
running at 2.6 gigahertz at the like TDP
all-day rating which is where it's able
to comfortably sit all the time or when
it boots up it can go up to 3.4
gigahertz for expandability it has two
so-dimm slots and go up to 32 gigabytes
and currently supports 21 33 megahertz
for a total speed for drive
expandability you have 2 m2 slots which
are able to fully support the full speed
of a 950 pro so you don't really have to
worry about storage speeds either in
terms of i/o on the front you have an SD
card slot a power button two USB 3.0
ports one of which is a charging port so
while it's off it can still charge one
of your devices a headphone jack and an
IR receiver on the back you have power
in a headphone / optical microphone Jack
an rj45 Ethernet gigabit port two USB
3.0 ports a display port a USB 3.1
type-c connector an HDMI 2.0 for full 4k
60 Hertz on the right-hand side you have
a metal reinforced Kensington lock which
is awesome because if it was just plain
plastics I want to just be able to rip
it off the Kensington lock which kind of
defeats the purpose on the bottom for
when you're taking apart there's captive
screws so you unscrew them and they
actually stay connected to the plate
which is great because losing little
tiny screws it's
/ frustrating and you have replaceable
face plates on the top so you can have
the awesome face plate with the skull on
it which I highly recommend you use or
if you need even more like a business
application where you don't want to have
skulls on things you do have the mat
plate which does still feature the
hexagon pattern on the left hand side
which is super awesome and if you take
that plate off of the top you have more
expanded i/o for if you want to put this
thing in your own custom chassis or you
just don't need the top cover for
whatever reason that IO is a USB 3.0
header which is not the standard one
you'd find in a desktop so you might
have to go looking for a custom part for
that a common i/o header which supports
USB 2.0 light switches all that kind of
stuff and possibly an NFC header but
that's not necessarily finalized at this
point for wireless you have Intel
wireless AC which is probably what you
expected and for power you have 120 watt
power from the wall which is running at
19 volts and 6.3 amps it actually
usually only pulls like 60 to 65 watts
but that extra expanded wattage is there
for things that might need to be powered
over Thunderbolt
su-hyun Thunderbolt you can do some
pretty awesome stuff so that's nice and
small but if you want to expand it with
a dedicated graphics card you can get
something like the Razer core run that
thunderbolt connection to it and run
what they're currently running which is
an r9 nan-oh you can fit full-sized
graphics cards in here but they're
running a nano nanos are great I love
nanos that's completely fine and you can
do stuff like run Just Cause 3
completely fine it's not even that easy
of a game to run and they're running it
no problemo
so that sounds pretty sick but when can
you get your hands on one well they have
pre-orders right now on new egg but they
won't be shipping until sometime in May
not entirely sure when during that month
but it's May that's probably fine it's
about 650 US dollars suggested retail
price not entirely sure exactly how much
it's going to cost and that is the bare
bones system so without any memory and
without any storage space so if you are
interested check out newegg.com they
have them for pre-order right now to
search up skull Canyon like you do
