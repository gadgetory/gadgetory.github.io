coverage on the LG this is the N 1 T 1
Nast unit so it's a combination as unit
external optical and USB drive so I'm
using their NAS detector software and I
have successfully located the LG NAS so
that was easy would you like to create a
desktop icon for the selected NAS
Network filter yes ok
that was relatively simple so why don't
we do a quick speed test and then I'm
actually going to I've installed two
pieces of LG's software the NAS monitor
and the NAS detector so I'm launching
the NAS monitor right now you can see I
just used their disk and click on those
and then install them so here we've got
the NAS monitor launching hopefully
shortly is this it yeah there it is ok
so about Nass monitor open why don't we
open the web menu here we go so hmm I
don't have a user ID it must have a
default one I'm gonna try admin with no
password sometimes it's admin I may have
to come back shortly hey it's admitted
min that was easy
ok so we've got a bunch of different
stuff in here you can see that we have
the the basics of our nav so usage
amount is all went around one percent
we've got the firmware revision the fan
is set to silent let's see what else we
can look at here so here's all of our
network info so it's the system name
system description you can change all
that good stuff
IP address you can set it to obtain one
manually or not a system time we have a
number of other things that we can check
out here so power it has different power
settings ok that's pretty neat
Wow it's got a ton of stuff in here you
can do firmware updates from within this
this menu right here
see mail notification so you can get
mail notification when let's see a
notification trigger your harddrive
status reports okay cool cool can setup
user accounts
as well as shared folder names you can
do file backup so you can it looks like
you can backup to DVD which would be
kind of neat
okay so you've actually got built-in
burning software right into the web menu
so you throw a DVD in there and you can
backup anything from your hard drive to
the disk you can rename your disk to
something else that's kind of cool it
has a backup button so that's for the
optical drive down a backup or back up
to image so you have a couple different
options you can schedule backup so you
can do USB backup and it also supports
Apple Time Machine you can set it to
which volumes you want to backup so you
can do torrents yeah I can have a
network printer it's a file server and
finally it's about nineteen server as
well as the deal and II okay so that is
pretty much all I wanted to say about
this particular menu lets do a quick
performance test so I have okay I guess
we'll know pretty quick whether or not
it's working at gigabit speeds but I
have movie files so this is a 266
megabyte file and I'm going to go ahead
and cut and paste it into the public
volume let's see how long it takes all I
need permission okay maybe I won't put
it in there okay let's try X hard drive
cut
okay any dad just need to enter that
admin admin because you could set up
different stuff yeah yeah there we go
okay so paste let's see how long it
takes
okay so far that's looking at kind of
like that's looking at about like ten
hundred speeds but we will know for sure
when we actually do the read test from
the nest so remember if you want to know
exactly how fast it's going all you
don't use this number here one there
instead you should use the total size of
the file 266 Meg's over the amount of
time it took to copy/paste it so let's
go ahead and paste that to the desktop
and let's see if that goes any faster
yes it is
so the write speeds are a little bit
limited on this particular Nass but the
read speeds are quite good at over 30
megabytes per second and don't forget
that it has the capability with the
switch on the back to be used with a
simple USB cable which they do include
in the box so you just got a straight
USB a to a cable and then all you do is
flick the switch right here and you can
change it to an external optical drive
or to an external hard drive that
operates off USB just with the flick of
a button so right now you can see I have
it set to NAS and I'm gonna move the
camera close to it just to demonstrate
that you cannot hear that fan at all in
fact I think it's off right now I heard
it spin up when it turned on so it is
not defective but it's gone ahead and
turned it off because there is no need
for the fan to cool the hard drive when
it's not doing anything really intensive
so that's the silent setting that we saw
before thank you for checking out my
performance test of the LG network
