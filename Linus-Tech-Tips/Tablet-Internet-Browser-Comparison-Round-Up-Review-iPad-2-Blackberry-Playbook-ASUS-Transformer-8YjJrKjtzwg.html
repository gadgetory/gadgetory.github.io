go actually i'll zoom these out and then
so i'm here on the NCIX homepage I want
to do a quick browser test between the
ipad to the android 3.0 asus transformer
and then the blackberry playbook running
their own OS so here we go what I'm
going to do is I'm loading only pages
here that i have not pre cached okay so
bear that in mind guys and i'm going to
get cameraman to help me press all three
at the same time so on one three two one
and we're going to see who manages to
load up the forums the fastest and what
the drawing on the screen is like so the
PlayBook is pretty strong as well as the
ipad 2 now let's just do some quick
zooming so I'm going to go show you guys
one at a time so let's do the android
3-pointer platform first let's zoom in
on the NCIX easter sale let's have a
look at that side banner up close ok and
then let's zoom out here okay now let's
do the ipad 2 easter sale and zoom oh
and now let's have a look at the
playbook so for that one because of the
wide screen and small screen form factor
we actually have to scroll down a little
bit there we go so smoothing is quite
quite smooth on the blackberry i was
very very impressed by that aspect of
its operation now i have loaded up the
hardware canucks home page and this is
something that i cannot complain about
enough when it comes to ipad 2 so here's
how you switch between tabs on all three
devices i guess i just showed you how to
do that so true tabbed browsing here on
the android three-point plan form with
the tabs up at the top much like chrome
whereas with the other two you actually
have to access them through an
additional button here which I don't
mind especially on this one and then you
can just click back to your app to get
rid of that and then on the iPad it
brings you to like kind of an index of
all your different tabs that you have
open okay so let's try going to the
forums which I have not done yet the
only page i've loaded is
the main homepage on hard work connects
hardware Cox is my favorite tech review
site actually since it's all about
reviews why don't we go ahead and load
up the reviews section of the website so
cameraman if you please three two one
okay the PlayBook was pressed a little
bit slower so bear that in mind I'll
selecting we pressed it wrong all we did
was highlight it so let's go back and
let's go to articles this time instead
okay ready hold on me wait till those
pages is okay ready okay three two one
here we go okay so Android 3-pointer has
a clear win now any speed advantage you
see on the ipad 2 may be deceptive
because you can see it doesn't have to
load any of the flash content like this
sniper gaming memory bit this rampage
three Black Edition these are
flash-based banners and so those are
just not being loaded by the ipad 2 so
let's go ahead and why don't we just
fire up the forums as well as one last
one last test I know this is not like a
proper browser test by any stretch of
the imagination but it should give you
guys at least a little quick rough idea
of what it's like to navigate to 3 2 1
web pages on these three different
platforms I think you pressed it wrong
again you moved when you pressed it okay
okay last one that last one guys I
promise this time we'll go to news which
we have not been to yet ok this time
cameraman is going to try cameraman is
going to operate the ipad 2 since that's
clearly what he's most comfortable with
ok ready 3 2 1
finally they're all slow for this page
and evidently I screwed up on the
playbook that time well whatever you
guys see how long it takes thank you for
checking out our little browser test
which was clearly very poorly executed
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other looks like i said terribly poorly
executed videos like this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
