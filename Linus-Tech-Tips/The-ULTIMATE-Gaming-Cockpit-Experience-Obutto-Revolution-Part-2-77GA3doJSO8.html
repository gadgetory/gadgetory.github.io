revolution was to find the most be a
monitor setup on the planet and take a
look at this thing from a Productivity
and gaming perspective all in one shot
unfortunately and this is a super-duper
first world problem I ended up with a
surround setup of 3 LG 31 mu 97 displays
which are absolutely beautiful 31 inch
monitors but all that up to an ungodly
26.5 million pixel resolution that no
current graphics card setup could even
hope to drive in modern triple-a titles
so in my unintentional part one I talked
about productivity and comfort because
datte screen real estate and that
flexibility of the setup and you can
check that one out here while I waited
for a soos to send me three rog swift PG
278 cue gaming monitors so that i could
actually play some games on the bloody
thing and by the way that stick and
throttle that you see the X 55 the
review of that is coming soon
you can ensure swift victory with
Corsairs highly responsive lightweight
gaming mouse their Sabre RGB click my
face hopefully if Nik remembers the
annotation to learn more so I'll start
with why I picked the PG 2 7 8 Q out of
all the 1440p monitors on the market
it features lightning-fast pixel
response times a 144 Hertz refresh rate
Nvidia g-sync while I wouldn't recommend
it for a pro photographer for a TN
monitor really not bad color
reproduction and viewing angles the
second of which is especially critical
and they surround setup n you know what
to screwed if you want to know more
about this monitor it's great check out
my review of it here the next thing I'd
like to address about this setup is that
while the PG 278 cues aren't impossible
to drive three of these suckers is still
about eleven million pixels hardly
child's play so everything you're seeing
demoed is on a very high-powered machine
running an Intel Core i7 59 60 X 8 Core
Extreme Edition processor at 4.2
gigahertz even overclocked 16 gigs of
DDR 4 memory and two gtx 980 graphics
cards in sli so with that out of the way
the first step is to gear up the cockpit
with my G 25 racing wheel setup this
process taught me a lot about both the
versatility of the O but oh I ended up
moving the chair back quite a bit
further moving the foot pad down and
reducing the angle of its incline so
away from my feet I ended up moving the
wheel mount closer to me tweaking
shifter height and then I was able to
finally bolt the wheel and foot pedals
onto the revolution with the
conveniently pre-drilled holes and clip
the shifter into place and then with
that down I sat down and promptly
accidentally wrenched the shifter off
the mount not because the mount is any
less secure than it ever was before you
know when I had it clipped onto the
table but because driving in the
revolution feels truly different from
driving at your desk
my usual racing game complaints will all
still exist until driving cockpits with
motion compensation get a lot more
affordable but with everything so
securely mounted and a more car-like
sitting posture I
definitely found myself falling into my
real driving habits of slouching with
one hand on the wheel and just throwing
the shifter around into gear so I'd
recommend drilling your own holes for
your shifter because accidentally
pulling it off was the one complaint
that I really had about this config
because everything else about it is just
better than doing this kind of thing at
your desk I mean one of the reasons my
g25 mostly sits in a closet is that it
is so inconvenient to set up and I
always end up tearing it down when I do
because it takes up so much space the
revolution takes care of that by making
your keyboard and mouse much more easily
accessible something that can be a huge
boon even when you are racing since so
many games are a pain in the butt to
navigate with the buttons built into
your wheel so my final thoughts on using
the Obot oh and the default racing
configuration are these this is the
first time I've ever really felt like
the g25 s toy grade build quality is
just not good enough
it takes the experience to another level
like to the point where I found myself
needing to wear shoes for better control
and craving force-feedback pedals and a
much more robust shifter unit and just
it generally gave me an understanding of
why people get really really deep into
this stuff but with that said driving
has never really been my thing anyway so
the next step for me was to use the
optional flight stick mount and convert
to a flight sim cockpit the whole
process took about half an hour
including watching the 1-minute guide on
a but O's website and involved removing
the shifter mount adding the mount on
the left for the throttle portion of my
X 55 and mounting the joystick mount you
can put the joystick over on the right
if you want but I went with the center
mount for a couple of reasons it does
make the seat a little more difficult to
get into and out of but I find the
center mount more natural and more
authentic feeling with my hands on it
and I found a great solution to my
complaints about the keyboard and mouse
tray from my productivity video having
it mounted on the right hand side puts
more support under my mouse hand and
causes it to shift or
found a lot less during use it also
makes the keyboard and mouse very
accessible with the joystick in for
games that have FPS and flight elements
so you can switch between them really
quickly and when you're done playing
outright and you don't want the joystick
in the way you want to bring the
keyboard mouse a little closer you just
pull one knob off put it aside and
you're ready to use it as a normal
computer one thing that sketched me out
a little bit about all of this was the
double-sided mounting tab tape that
Oberto expects you to use to mount your
hoe test but I was pleasantly surprised
when I simply placed the throttle down
on its mount to check the location and
almost couldn't get it off to reposition
it this is some serious business tape
and it should hold out for a long time
so let's talk about actually using it go
right well if you're into flight gains
and all I can really say is loads of fun
and then I can try to find different
ways to say loads of fun for the next
couple of minutes because it's freaking
awesome
I fired up star citizen elite dangerous
and an old favorite of mine x-wing and
everything I said about racing games
definitely applies here except to a
genre of games that I generally find a
lot more entertaining and interesting
even if I also suck at these I
definitely found star citizen a little
tough to play because at this resolution
I was dipping well under 30fps even at
low details but elite dangerous ran at
over 60 fps which especially with decent
looks bonner smooth and was just a blast
to play around with so it's time to draw
my final conclusions about the abut
Ellucian because there won't be a part 3
to this after my first video I wasn't
completely sold on it as a daily driver
workstation it's an okay chair on an
incredibly versatile seemingly
infinitely adjustable monitor slash
peripheral mount thing which is cool
really cool but not cool enough to
justify how much space it takes up in my
house after gaming on it I'm really
trying to figure out a way to get my
wife to let me keep this thing even if I
have to put it in the garage and wear a
jacket when I use it it's really really
freaking cool once you've done it
upright with the correct displays and
accessories and if you're racing or
flight enthusiasts with a couple grand
to burn then there's two things I have
to say to you
number one can I be your friend you seem
like a pretty cool baller sort of
individual and two don't even think
about trying one of these things because
you're enthusiast status is about to
reach newer crazier heights and that
money you had to burn well you won't
have it anymore
so guys that's pretty much it thanks for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment on the Linus tech tips form I'm
going to be monitoring that much more
closely than the comments on YouTube for
a variety of reasons many of which will
become clear in the future one of which
has to do with if you sign up for our
form it'll be a lot easier for us to
reach you given how broken the YouTube
sub boxes among other things actually I
need to do just like a general update at
some point here anyway guys linked in
