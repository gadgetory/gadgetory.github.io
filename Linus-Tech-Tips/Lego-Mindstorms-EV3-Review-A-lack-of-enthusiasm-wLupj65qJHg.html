you can build in program robots that do
what you want hearing on TV in 1998 this
is the commercial that sparked my
interest in robotics and programming
it's for the Lego Mindstorms
RCX robotics invention kit which a kid
could use to build and program almost
any kind of robot they could imagine
Lego Mindstorms has been an enormous
source of learning fun and inspiration
for millions of kids and adults and if
you don't believe me just search for
Mindstorms on youtube to be blown away
by some of the incredible things that
people have built and programmed using
these kits and the LEGO Group has
continued to update the Mindstorms
platform over the years with our CX NXT
and finally Eevee 3 the kit I'll be
reviewing today I know I'm three years
late to the party but this is still
their flagship robotics kit and I wanted
to see how it stacks up against new
competitors like vex IQ that and Linus
would only buy it if I made a video so
here we go
Corsairs ml fans feature magnetic
levitation technology and custom
engineered rotors to provide a high
performance low noise experience learn
more at the link in the video
description opening up the box we see a
bunch of disposable bags full of LEGO
pieces and no storage tray the first
generation of Mindstorms came with a
storage tray but ever since then only
the educational versions have had them
which is a shame really
I consider it essential to have
something like this for organization how
much would that have cost laïkó group
anyway to complete your first mission
all you need to do is follow the
characteristically excellent paper
instruction booklet which walks you
through the first stage of building and
running your first robot you can drive
it around with the included IR remote
and it's preloaded with a demo that
autonomously knocks tires around on the
included testing mat the paper
instructions then prompt you to download
the free Evie 3 programmer app which is
very easy to install and get started
with other companies take note kids and
Terrans do not have the patience to
wrestle with poorly designed software
and the ev3 software itself is actually
fantastic there's been a lot of
development since generations 1 &amp;amp; 2 each
of the 5 featured robots and the 12
additional robots come with instructions
for building and programming this
involves the placing and modifying of
programming blocks onto the programing
canvas you're introduced to motor
control first then loops switches
variables multitasking and functions
which are called my blocks following
along with these step-by-step
programming instructions is easy and the
complexity of both the robot and the
programming increases from one mission
to the next you are also given the
option to load the finished programs for
each mission I'm glad that they did this
but it's a bit of a double-edged sword
on the one hand it's good if you want to
double check your own solution but on
the other hand like answers at the
bottom of a crossword it makes cheating
easy potentially taking out a lot of the
fun and learning again though it's clear
that a ton of research and development
has gone into the ev3 software when you
modify variables the icons change to
match when you add a sound or an
on-screen image to your program you get
to hear or see a preview on your
computer which helps a lot if you need
to debug a script and each mission comes
with a short video that shows you
exactly what your robot will do if
programs successfully this process can
feel a little slow sometimes but you're
probably learning more than you think
the method of programming is quite
simplistic this is important to keep the
barrier of entry low enough for kids but
it also results in a lower learning
ceiling fortunately there are several
third-party options for programming the
ev3 brick if you want more control and
complexity there are a few things I did
not like about the ev3 software worst of
which was how it inexplicably crashed
about five times during normal operation
they might want to look into that so I'd
give it a solid a - let's move on to the
hardware I was not impressed in fact I
was pretty disappointed the ev3 is in
many ways a step backwards from the
previous generation NXT 2.0 first of all
the ev3 brain brick which requires six
double-a batteries takes at least 20
seconds to turn off and even longer to
turn on that's as long as my work
computer and Linus built that turns out
the ev3 brain is literally booting a
complete Linux OS and this software
bloat means that it needs more RAM and a
better CPU than it otherwise would which
just drives up the price now there are
many features on the ev3 brain that I do
like such as the SD card slot the
Bluetooth and wireless connectivity and
the RGB LED behind the buttons but the
ev3 actually comes with fewer sensors
than the NXT 2.0 it's got a color sensor
just one touch sensor instead of two and
the ultrasonic sensor is replaced by the
infrared sensor that pulls double duty
as distance sensor and as receiver for
the beacon the infrared beacon or remote
control has
five buttons and a switch that can
select one of four channels the problem
here is that there are only eleven
possible ways to use these buttons and
the lack of joysticks means that there's
no proportional control and with the
standard control scheme if you want to
control a third or fourth motor you'll
have to switch to another channel but
with only four total channels you'd
better hope that there are no other Lego
enthusiasts nearby with beacons of their
own compared to radio control infra red
is awful anyway with short-range and
frequent disconnections the large Evie
three motors however feature several
welcome improvements with attachment
holes in positions that offer more build
flexibility they're even backwards
compatible with NXT which is pretty cool
Evie 3 also comes with a new medium
motor it's weaker so you won't use it to
power a drive shaft but its shape makes
it better for attachments like arms and
claws I just wish that there were two of
these included for the price let's talk
about the rest of the pieces now the
most iconic Lego piece is probably the
2x4 studded brick this is classic Lego
and it's easy and quick for kids to
attach and detach while still ensuring a
strong connection so it may surprise you
to learn that all the LEGO pieces in the
ev3 kit are studless they've been
designed to be attached using pins and
axles instead it's great in theory
because it allows for a predictable
eight millimeter three-dimensional grid
system but here's the problem when they
remove the studs they removed half the
attachment points on a typical beam so
studless beams cannot be stacked on top
of each other without extensive
additional support one solution would be
a double or triple wide beam but the
LEGO Group doesn't make any pieces like
that
so they've effectively removed
functionality that we used to have and
never bother to replace it there's
actually a lot of LEGO Technic pieces
that really should exist but don't I
even 3d modeled a bunch of them and I
sell them at cost on Shapeways where
people are still willing to pay
unreasonable amounts of money to get
them despite all of that Lego Mindstorms
is
still great and it still plays an
important role in getting kids
interested in STEM fields I just don't
see the same enthusiasm as I do from the
Technic and power functions teams who
continue to push the boundaries by
releasing interesting and even insane
sets like this one but Mindstorms has
just stagnated and it's especially
apparent when you look at the
competition vex IQ came out several
months before Lego Mindstorms ev3 and
the electronic hardware is objectively
better in almost every single way
without compromising quality check out
that video review over here so here's
the conclusion people still ask me all
the time if they should buy vex IQ or
Mindstorms and I tell them if you're
more interested in robotics and
programming get vex IQ but if you're
more interested in building and
engineering and you already have League
of Technic pieces Mindstorms or power
functions is the better option
ultimately though the best robotics kit
would be some miraculous fusion of vex
IQ inspired electronics and LEGO Technic
pieces I certainly hope that the LEGO
Group will step up their game for
Mindstorms generation for I guess we'll
just have to wait and see thanks a lot
for watching everyone give the video a
like or a dislike and get subscribed if

LTT merch or shop at amazon using our
affiliate link and please let us know in

experience has been like and have you
tried the ev3 what did you think of it
and if you're looking for something else

vex IQ review for one of the best
robotics kits on the market or check out
my mechanoid review for the absolute
