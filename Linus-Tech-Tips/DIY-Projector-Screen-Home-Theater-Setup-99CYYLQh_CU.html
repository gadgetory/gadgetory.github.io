super cool little tiny CRT TVs ah with
the built-in VCR and what I would do is
whenever my parents were not looking or
I was sick or whatever is I also had a
bunk bed so I would grab an extension
cord that TV and my Super Nintendo and
some blankets and I'd built myself like
a little bunk bed home theater
so when LG showed me their probiems
projector and wanted to sponsor a
project I immediately went why don't we
bring that concept into the 21st century
so check this out right now it's just an
ordinary bunk bed but by the end of this
video it's gonna be a theater
let's get everything we need for the
project together Pro beam projector and
then I want an Intel look do you want
the gaming one or the regular one gaming
one perfect good choice so arguably what
I could have done was gone on to a
projector screen size calculator but
that's not the lightest Actives way so
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take
a sacrificial blanket I'm gonna see how
big of a screen we need it's kind of
where you would want to watch like right
there okay you got that okay little man
you got a you got yeah there we go
so we're gonna do a classic haul video
here we got a shelf
uh we got a vinyl blind just a pretty
cheap one twelve millimeter thick though
we've got some melamine finishing tape
junk in case we have to make our own
shelf we've got some brackets in case we
have to make our own shelf cuz this
one's pretty borderline and we got some
Plasti Dip to do like a black border
around it DIY projector screen baby just
want to protect your screen what you
need to do is you need to have a black
frame around the image area so because
we're just using a cheap vinyl blinds
from the hardware store we need to
create our own so we've got some
straight spray on rubber stuff we've got
some masking tape we've got a measuring
tape and we've got our vinyl blood
ah I used to go on a lot every year
okay so that's a problem sorry honey
we're not actually playing hockey right
now I'm trying to cut a thing and I'm
using the nets to hold it up seems
sturdy
it says to turn it to 400 but this is
just like cotton wool so great I've
never done this before but the
instructions make it sound fairly
straightforward I just wrap it right
around nope that just broke it it just
broke off shelf construction done okay
so we're still waiting for paint to dry
which means now's as good a time as any
to throw in some we actually got wow
this is 32 gigs of ram into our neck and
hope this hasn't it OS on it already
it's a 950 pro 512 gigas SD Hey all
right rock on automatically prompts for
a new input and because my OCD requires
it you're plugged into HDMI one cool is
that dope is it sick is it sweet yeah
it's a straight pimp okay so this is
like definitely not the most
professional way to mount a projector so
let's kind of
all right okay out okay can you take the
wait you can't
oh now it's stuck here oh oh oh oh I'll
be right back
no you don't for the amount of weight
Hey looking pretty good hey there we go
so you know what we're just gonna run
those down there that's not too bad
actually okay that's better than I
thought it might go it only takes one
bad rip right now to completely ruin it
though this is the moment of reckoning
right now
perfect no functional let's find out can
you hold this here for a sec oh I gotta
sit the wall if I stand right in the
middle here is that better so you can
see all four corners and if you adjust
the projector make sure it's still
perpendicular to the wall to notch this
Intel oh shoot I just spent the last 10
minutes fighting with my little propped
up thing and trying to put stuff under
the feet because there's only two
settings auto Keystone on or Auto
Keystone off didn't realize that you can
fine-tune it boom you're done it's
perfect I'm not gonna lie I did not come
up with a more permanent mounting
solution for these audio engine a two
pluses because our original speakers
didn't end up working and because I
really wasn't sure if this would end up
being that great of a solution so I'm
like super excited on this right now
