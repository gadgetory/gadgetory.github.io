welcome to the HTC spare change giveaway
on Linus tech tips the theme of the
giveaway is very simple HTC's latest
campaign with Robert Downey jr. which
you should check out in the video
description we've got it linked there is
all about change and how passionate they
are about it at HTC of course that
change might refer to innovation in the
smartphone industry but it can be
anything maybe a change of lifestyle a
change of heart or just a little spare
change what we are going to be changing
courtesy of HTC is your smartphone we're
giving away two three HTC One phones two
lucky winners anywhere in the world to
win we want you to tell us your change
story it can be anything a huge
terrifying change that's coming soon
which will of course be funny if you've
watched the Robert Downey jr. video an
inspiring change made by you or someone
you know or maybe a change you want to
make in your life phone number one is
very simple post a change themed message
as a Robert Downey jr. video comment so
go to that video post a comment then
what you're going to do is post a link
to your youtube comment on twitter with
hashtag HTC spare change this hashtag is
very important because it allows us to
find qualifying entries and allows HTC
to track participation in our contest so
they can justify giving us more cool
stuff to give away to you guys in the
future so that's it post a youtube
comment post a tweet linking to the
comment use the hashtag phone number two
is less simple but if you do a good job
your chances of winning will be higher
video responses might be gone from
YouTube but we can still do a video
response contest if we jump through some
hoops make a 30 second or less change
themed video and be creative entries
will be judged out of 10 by me slick
edzell and Brandon and the one with the
highest overall score wins we will
consider many different factors
including pure subjectivity style humor
and how emotionally provocative they are
but the most important thing is
creativity and keeping your entry under
30 seconds no exceptions all youtube
video titles for valid entries
must contain hashtag HTC spare change
all entries must be shared on some form
of social media with a link back to this
video and more is better all entries
must be posted in the contest thread on
Linus tech tips car forum the quorum on
Linus tech tips forum annotated here and

entries will be monitored throughout the
contest and when it closes in four weeks
we will do a live stream showing off the
winners as well as the honorable
mentions so good luck everyone the full
contest deals are linked under the video

having me tell you about it good luck
