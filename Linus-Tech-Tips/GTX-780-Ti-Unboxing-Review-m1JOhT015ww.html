there are a few things that get us more
excited around here that high-end
graphics card launches and as far as
single GPUs go the GTX 780 Ti is about
as high-end as it gets
we'll start with the tech specs it has
the same gk110 lineage and Titan DNA as
the GTX Titan and the GTX 780 it also
has a full 2880 CUDA course that is 25%
more than GTX 780 that is a full-fledged
gk110 core it is clocked at an 875 base
clock 928 boost clock clock speed
meeting we have not only more CUDA cores
but also higher clock speeds and it
comes with three gigabytes of gddr5
memory at 7 gigahertz on 384 bit bus so
we're actually getting faster memory as
well physically the card looks pretty
darn similar to the last gen so there's
two sli connectors with support for two
three or four-way SLI you've got that
same acoustically optimized fan with the
slow ramp up and down so that it's less
jarring when it has to speed up or slow
down we've got a cast aluminum shroud
with dark aluminum fins visible through
the polycarbonate window so those are
mounted on a vapor chamber that takes
heat away from the GPU on the back of
the card we have two dual link DVI ports
HDMI and DisplayPort now with support
for 4k and triple surround however I
maintain that this is pretty expensive
and kind of irrelevant right now I think
it's just a feature checkbox that they
want to have compared to the competition
we've yet to see a gaming rig with a 4k
monitor on it posted on the lines tech
tips forum so I'm just not convinced
that it exists yet at the bottom we find
the PCI Express 3.0 16x connector and
then at the top to correspond with that
250 watt TDP we've got an 8 pin and 6
pin power connector the cooler is a
blower style design so while a little
bit of heat is going to be exhausted out
the back of a card into your case most
of it is going to be exhausted out the
rear of your PC case so that it doesn't
affect the cooling of your other
components we've got the usual
effects in terms of in-game technology
DirectX 11 ambient occlusion TxAA
tessellation physics and there are some
upcoming games and hot new titles that
support these features on the screen
right now hopefully there's no mention
funnily enough of 3d vision but don't
worry guys it's still very much
supported I just guess that that
particular trend didn't take off the way
that TV manufacturers and some other
folks hoped that it would g-sync on the
other hand is a game changer it looks
dramatically better when the framerate
is variable at all which happens in
every game as you move from more or less
demanding scenes and in between them it
dynamically adapts the refresh rate of
your monitor that is how many images per
second according to the frame rate
actually being output from your GPU now
it does rely on hardware support but
we're expecting to see monitors sometime
in 2014 you'll also need a Kepler based
GPU and hopefully from the manufacturers
that you see here that are already
partnered up we're going to see great
high resolution high refresh rate
designs with a variety of different
panel types whether it's TN or IPS or
whatever else and these are going to
come in at reasonable prices because
trust me guys I'm one of the several
people on earth that's actually seen
this it is amazing and once you try it
you are going to want it
GPU boost 2.0 functionality has been
tweaked some what with their power
balancing feature and Luke will tell you
more about that after but fundamentally
the technology hasn't changed much so
it's monitoring voltage temperatures
power consumption and clock speeds in
order to deliver the most balanced
performance at any given time without
exceeding any of those parameters now
there's a difference between how AMD
views balanced performance and how in
video views balanced performance with
this generation
it runs substantially cooler and much
quieter than the r9 290 series but there
were some things that we didn't
necessarily like about this
implementation there's very limited
control in terms of voltages and power
limits it gives us a whopping 106
percent power limit maximum and even
with things like temperature settings it
seems to be ignoring what we say anyway
we set a maximum of 95 degrees because
we were like go to town I mean AMD set
95 degrees let's run it 95 degrees I
didn't run at 95 degrees so it just ran
at 83 degrees so it doesn't even seem to
seem to be taking our input as
Destin's with that said we still
achieved over twelve hundred megahertz
on the core so that is one hell of an
overclock and very beastly performance
as you guys are going to see so maybe it
just runs at eighty three degrees and
that's all there is to it this could be
partly due to the larger die as well as
the more mature design so a larger dial
aoz you to inherently spread the heat
out more easily using the heatsink
GeForce experience continues to get
updates but first the stuff that hasn't
been changed it still gives you
automatic driver update so you get a
little notification in the corner hey
you got that new game hey there's a new
driver to go with it make sure you
install that yay it also gives you
optimized settings for your games and
there's actually quite a complicated
process to determine these actual people
sit there and play the game find
benchmark able segments that are
demanding then they determine a target
frame rate for these demanding segments
way graphics settings against each other
you know play around the sliders well
does this actually make it look that
much better and how hard is it for the
graphics hardware to handle and then
they find the best settings that satisfy
the FPS target and still make it look as
good as possible then they run all that
information through automated validation
across thousands of hardware
configurations in order to deliver you a
playable gaming experience I've tried it
and it works I ended up tweaking a
couple things further but the great
thing about GeForce experience is that
you can have it deliver better graphical
fidelity to high-end gamers who don't
want to tinker with things you can have
it help low end gamers like you can see
this example with a GT 540 m achieve
playable frame rates even on low-end
machines and most importantly for people
like me we're going to tweak things
anyway you can install it then
completely ignore it and do everything
manually through the driver now onto the
numerous stuff now these next two
features do require GTX 650 or up you
have to have a Kepler GPU with a
built-in h.264 encoder but man are they
cool game stream is awesome I've been
using an Nvidia shield to play Batman
Arkham City because I'm a little bit
behind on the Batman franchise using the
GTX Titan in my desktop PC and then a
very solid wireless router guy's a beast
wireless router is required I'm using a
Seuss's AC and 66u or whatever it is but
it is amazing PC grade graphics on a
handheld or with their new console mode
for shield you can stream them to your
TV at 720p or 1080p
with an upcoming patch that's coming
later on and when you factor in that
with high-end graphics card 717 up you
can get $100 off a shield that's a $200
add-on that is essentially a PC game
console adapter thing for your TV and a
handheld that can stream from your PC
it's pretty freakin awesome and then
next up is shadow play right now it
supports local recording only although
twitch streaming integrated into your
graphics card driver essentially is
coming soon it records at 60fps at up to
1080p so it's better than most
standalone hardware recorders and it can
just record passively in the background
so you can kind of go oh well that was
awesome I want to grab that and you can
actually retro actively grab up to 20
minutes of pre-recorded footage in
Windows 8 using their passive shadow
play mode or you can have unlimited
recording in manual mode now it's not
perfect it's like not perfect yet by all
means but I mean there's no OpenGL
support so no minecraft guys but it has
very very small file sizes and the
quality looks great and it is a
negligible less than 10 percent
performance impact so it's something
that you can actually have running all
the time which is very very cool for
game streamers compared to software
recording like fraps so that's it for
the tech now onto performance we ran all
of our graphics cards on our standard
overclocked 39 60 X testbench
all video cards were overclocked as
usual if you want stock benchmarks there
are a hundred other guys that do things
that way so go for it go look at their
benchmarks you can see our overclocking
settings in the Google Doc link in the
video description if you have any
questions about how we overclocked the
graphics cards or what frequencies
they're running at we recorded frame
rates using fraps after giving each
graphics card a few minutes to warm up
in game this is important because the
way GPU boost 2.0 and power tune adjust
performance based on temperatures it's a
necessary step for getting accurate GPU
performance so without further adue over
to link just so you guys know the
overclocking dock is linked in the
description below and has all of our
settings for all of our cards and just
in case you haven't seen it yet on the
far right side there's a new column that
we introduced a little while ago called
core clock actual which is displaying
our observed clock speeds for the cars
with GPU boost 2 and all these new
technologies they happen to throw back
quite easily so what we're showing is
not what we set it at
showing is what its actually performing
as and our card is performing quite well
at twelve hundred and fifty six now
that's with an offset of plus 250 if I
ignored the crashing that I was having
in Tomb Raider at higher clock speeds I
was pushing easily 300 the charts have
been pretty self-explanatory thus far
with the 70 tee I pretty much crushing
everything although that does make sense
due to its much higher price point
that's something that you have to keep
in mind the question that is most likely
on quite a few of your minds is what
happened to the Titan a it's not in your
benchmarks B it's a slower car to see
it's much more expensive well it's kind
of a developers card now it's not really
a gaming card anymore it has that double
precision feature on it which is kind of
awesome for certain developers that can
actually utilize it and other than that
it's just kind of sitting up there by
itself if you're looking for an
extremely high-end gaming card and you
were looking at the Titan I would maybe
divert your focus to the 780ti you may
need that six gigs of ram I have noticed
in some of our higher resolution
benchmarks that it is starting to
utilize a lot of the RAM and getting
fairly close to its max although not
that close mind you so one thing to do
if you need that extra RAM might be wait
a little while and see if those
different versions of the 780ti coming
on later we have no idea but I hope
there is because that would be very
interesting I'm sure a debate that will
go on is is this card overkill for 1080p
I would not say quite yet in Far Cry 3
in Crysis 3 with all the settings max we
don't get our average FPS over 60 and I
would personally think that the perfect
1080p experience would be 60 FPS plus
and with stars' isn't on the horizon we
don't know what's going to happen there
but it's probably going to push it even
harder so I could still see this car
being justified for 1080p but I might
want to go a little bit higher and where
this card really shows its prowess is in
the higher resolutions are 2560 by 1600
benchmarks were very impressive although
again in Crysis 3 we saw a little bit
sub 34 our average FPS so I would love
to see two of these cards unless a live
start crushing games in those higher
resolutions this card is kicking butt
and takin names but it definitely comes
with a price tag in the comments below
are you going to be looking for a card
like this with a premium price tag but
with that level of experience or are you
going to go for something more like
say at r9 290 where you can save a bunch
of money and it's a little bit hot and
heavy but you're still getting a lot of
performance out of it what do you guys
think if you like this video like the
video if you dislike this video dislike
this video and as always please
