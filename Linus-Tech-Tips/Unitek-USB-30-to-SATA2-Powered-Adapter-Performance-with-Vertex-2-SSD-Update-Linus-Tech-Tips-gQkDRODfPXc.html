for quite a while I actually unboxed
this Unitec USB 3.0 to say to to adapter
quite some time ago so it comes with a
power plug which I'm just gonna kind of
crawl under the table here and plug into
my already loaded up power bar there
okay so you got a power plug so that's
gonna provide all the necessary power
okay so now the light turns on and then
I just wanted to do a quick speed test
with this thing on a motherboard that
actually supports USB 3 so in this case
I'm using the P 7 P 55 D premium and I'm
gonna go ahead and plug it into an SSD
to give us the fastest possible speeds
out of it so you just plug it in like
that matches right up with the SATA
interface on the drive these things are
so useful when you have something on a
test bench that you need to to pull data
off of or if you're just you know
running Diagnostics on a hard drive or
whatever else so I'm gonna go ahead and
unplug the the Seagate USB 3 cable I've
gotten there now plug in this one there
we go so the vertex 2 is detected
already okay there we go
vertex 2 yep okay so let's get this
opened up here and let's just do a quick
test so first of all why don't we do ok
my movies done alright so I got my big
files folder ok why don't we just do the
big files folder so I'm actually I'll do
a quick read test although I don't know
how useful that'll be so I cancel no no
delete get rid of it
ok so I'm just gonna cut this off of the
drive that I just installed and I'm
going to paste it onto a vertex 120 gig
so this doesn't go I'm gonna go as fast
as it probably potentially can this is
only going at about 83 megabytes per
second 90 so this is gonna be pretty
much capping out the vertex 120 this is
the original vertex whereas this is a
vertex 2 so the difference between these
drives is that they both have excellent
read speeds but the vertex 2 just wipes
the floor with the vertex 1 in terms of
writes so what I'm gonna do is as soon
as I've got this file copied onto the
desktop I'm gonna go ahead and copy it
back onto my vertex to drive so this
should actually go quite a bit faster
and we'll probably see pretty much the
limits of usb3 here so this is going at
162 megabytes per second so that's very
very fast it's a little slower now it's
come down to 128 so about 130 megabytes
per second so we're not even approaching
the limits of the drive but this is
probably the practical limit of what
we're gonna see from the NEC USB 3
controller and if you really want to
know how long these tests took I guess
you could just kind of I don't know run
back the video and then you'd know so
anyway there we go there's the speed
test it's done now and there we go
almost and it's done okay so that's the
Unitec USB 3.0 2 SATA 2 adaptor you know
I'm kind of curious about something
though let's see if it works without the
power plugged in with a two and a half
inch drive okay why don't I sort of give
it a chance to like try over try again
here because that would be an advantage
that that Seagate cable from the from
their modular hard drive has if they're
able to plug into an SSD without an
additional power source ok your device
is ready to use plug it in let's see if
we can run into the half-inch drive off
of this particular cable your device is
ready to use USB mass-storage is what
it's calling itself this time it looks
like no it cannot that's quite
unfortunate but I mean the power allows
you to also potentially plug ins much
more draw power drawing devices so here
why don't we try this then since we're
on the subject of testing things I
actually tested the Seagate cable which
is here this one right here down from
that modular interface external hard
drive and that worked without external
power with a an SSD but what it didn't
work with was a an optical drive so I'm
going to go ahead and plug this Unitec
one into a DVD drive and see if that
works when it actually has power so
installing device driver software
click for status cd-rom drive so it's
working on it so it all depends on what
kind of a solution you're looking for if
you want something that works without
any sort of additional cables and muss
and fuss then I guess you want something
like the Seagate cable if you want
something that will actually work with a
wider variety of a higher power devices
it looks like this Unitec cable is about
to work but we don't have evidence of it
yet
there we go ready to use and let's see
if it shows up in here refresh refresh
go go do it now there we go
so I can use my CD drive which I don't
think I have anything installed in so
there you go
with my big test and I managed to drop
my headphones thank you for watching my
video blog and don't forget to subscribe
okay I have a Cronus true image in there
