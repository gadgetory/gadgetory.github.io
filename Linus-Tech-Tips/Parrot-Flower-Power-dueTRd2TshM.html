welcome to my unboxing an overview of
the parrot flower power what the hell is
this you might be asking yourself and
what it is is a very innovative little
product as the wise Sheldon Cooper once
said penny everything is better with
Bluetooth now you can use bluetooth to
grow your plants right now compatibility
is limited to iOS devices only that
support Bluetooth smart but
compatibility may be extended to other
platforms in the future however it does
need Bluetooth smart in order to
function it has to be very power
efficient in order for something like
this to make sense the flower power is
meant to be planted close to an indoor
or outdoor plant it is water-resistant
so that is IP x5 and ipx7
certification and feature sensors which
I am trying to extract it from the box
and there we go alright
it features sensors for sunlight so that
one's right here
soil moisture which is actually there
look at this eco-friendly cardboard
packaging I love it even a little like
fake planter box that comes in is a is
like a piece of paper and then there's
like a little packet that looks like
seeds or something with the instructions
and it's adorable
those parrot guys they so funny anyway
sunlight soil moisture I'm gonna stop
buying time for myself to get this thing
out of here aha
soil moisture fertilizer levels and
finally air temperature are all detected
by this thing so it is designed for
people like me who allow things like
that to happen to every plant that they
touch look how dead that thing is I even
my wife had a fairly brown thumb for the
longest time until she finally had one
flower an orchid that she managed to
keep alive for an extended period of
time which I plan to steal and see if I
can then replicate that feat by using
this it sends push notifications to your
phone and you set it up by selecting
from a database
of more than 6,000 plants trees and
vegetables and it'll basically tell you
stuff like oh hey you could more
optimally position this plant in order
to get the right amount of sunlight or
hey this plant needs water you're three
days late and cool stuff like that so
without further ado I have to go
retrieve that flower which might be a
bit of a problem all right so I have a
dastardly plan to test the flower power
I'm going to head home and I'm going to
steal my wife's plant okay I don't think
she sees me Shh tonight vision mode that
doesn't seem to be working very well
bollocks I guess I could just turn on a
light oh yes apparently night vision
mode still needs a little bit of light
out kids all right there's the victim
the flower that I'm stealing now
putting it by the door
taking with me tomorrow
I don't have your orchid I don't know
you're talking about this is her orchid
I'm taking it so I can test that the
plant monitor happening all right so I
have returned alive from my mission here
guys and I've also figured out how to
install the battery in this thing so
positive terminal down then it's got a
nice little rubber seal here you go
ahead and pop that bad boy into place
there you go twist it so it's you know
stay oh there yeah look at that green
thing goes on so what I'm gonna do is
because I don't own an iPad Mini or you
know an iPhone 4s or an iPad 3rd gen is
I'm actually gonna borrow one to set
this up then in the time that I'm
waiting for mine to come in we will give
it about a week and see if the plant
manages to stay alive so we're just
going to stab it into the plant here
which hopefully won't damage it and
there you have it it is installed
wish me luck because if this thing dies
in the week that we are testing this I
will die too so I think the conclusion
for this is actually fairly simple now
I've had this plant running on the
flower power since Wow actually it's
been just over a month and so you can
actually see it gives you little handy
little graphs here you can look at live
data you can look at daily data weekly
data so you can break down things like
sunlight in terms of how it's doing for
light per day versus per week so you can
see patterns in the daylight over even
as much as a month 3 months 6 months or
a year and I think the conclusion here
is that while the flower power can tell
you all of this information you can
actually see the plant isn't in very
good shape there's nothing it can do to
make you actually deal with it
so in this case you can see the water
level when I got the plant was around
well around 15% and then it dropped all
the way down to about 5% which looks
like it might have floored out which
might even be
the lowest that it can measure and then
I just kind of didn't do anything with
it for like about 10 or 15 days in there
and so yeah is it in the greatest
condition no but is that the flower
powers fault
no it actually seems to work incredibly
well the only thing that it didn't track
from you was fertilizer which makes
sense because I don't have any
fertilizer in here at all so there you
go guys
if you're looking for a supremely
awesome gift for the gardener in your
family and you're willing to spend 60
bucks for something that helps you at
least know how to take care of your
plants even if it doesn't help you be
any less you know absent-minded about
actually doing anything I mean it does
give you notifications okay does help
people s hops in mind okay but it
doesn't help you be less lazy then there
you go guys the flower power looks like
a very very cool little gadget as always
guys don't forget to like this video if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it leave a comment and let me know what
you think not just about the flower
power I'd love to hear if you guys can
think of someone in your family this
would make sense for and of course
there's a link to where to buy it in the
video description but you know what do
you think of just generally connected
items like this are you okay having
connected stuff all over your house or
would you rather be just like you know
treat you know just learn how to take
care of your plants and just do it and
love to hear what you guys think about
that as always guys also don't forget to
subscribe and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
