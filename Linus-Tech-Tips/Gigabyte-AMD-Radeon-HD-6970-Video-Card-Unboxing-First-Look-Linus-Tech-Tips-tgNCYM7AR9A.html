unboxing of the all-new Radeon HD 6970
so I'm going to start with a bit of an
explanation of a couple things first of
all I'm going to explain the numbering
scheme on this card
so Andy used to have a numbering scheme
that went okay 59 70 was their highest
end dual GPU card and then 5870 was
their fastest single GPU card and then
58 50 was the the next one down and then
5770 was a different class of GPU that
used to be how it worked
now with the 6000 series they've
actually changed it so the 68 70 is not
the replacement for the 58 70 I've seen
some confusion in the comments under my
videos about this concept the 68 70 is
actually the replacement for the 57 70
and the 69 70 is the price point
replacement for the 58 70 and then there
will actually be another card coming
later that will be a dual GPU solution
because that same DS whole strategy is
build a scalable GPU at a reasonable
size with reasonable power so that you
can slap two of them together cool stuff
alright so the 69 70 first thing we're
going to notice it has two gigs of DDR 5
so what that means is you have double
the frame buffer bigger textures all
that good stuff in terms of performance
it's hard to say how much of a
performance difference there is right
now but I've got a feeling we might be
able to compare it to a 1 gig version
further on down the line now the only 2
gig version we had of the 5870 was
actually the eyefinity 6 Edition as well
as a couple custom parts and it did make
a small impact on that particular card
but this one's faster so we might see
more of a difference it's a gigabyte
card so it comes with a three-year
warranty in the US and Canada and here
we have the convenient list of all the
features that you need to know about
full DirectX 11 AMD eyefinity multi
display technology hence the multi
display behind me supports up to 4
monitors although I don't know that
that's necessarily the recommended
configuration supports PCI Express 2.0
1.8 EP full HD duh supports this never
mind 1080p AMD HD 3d technology
including hdmi 1.4 a for 3d blu-ray and
7.1 HD surround sound over HDMI as well
as DisplayPort 1.2 okay let's see if
there's anything else relevant on the
back oh yeah tessellation so the 6000
series is all about tessellation
performance that's one of the ways that
these new graphics cards are going to
significantly improve performance and I
need to destroy over the 5000 series
cards one of the other things that AMD
has really beefed up is the
anti-aliasing capability of this
particular graphics card you've got a
couple new modes that are going to
basically without a huge impact on
performance allow you to either have
higher quality anti-aliasing or cheaper
that is less performance impact
anti-aliasing here's a driver CD throw
it away
here is a manual read through it and
then keep it or throw it away I guess it
doesn't really matter to me next we have
adapters so based on the fact that we
have a dual x2 6 pin and a dual molex to
8 pin by the way this is a lot smarter
than most of the 8 pin adapters I see
which are dual 6 pin to 8 pin which is
ridiculous
do a molex tape and that makes sense
good job gigabyte that is a good thing
to include we have a crossfire bridge
standard length 4 standards facing
motherboards any of the non-standard
ones should come with their own
crossfire bridge anyway and then we have
the part itself it's quite heavy
actually it's a lot of lot of weight to
it for a single GPU AMD card so let's go
ahead and get this baby opened up on our
anti-static baggy piece of tape here and
we will see the 6970 in all its glory
that is a beastly looking card I really
like gigabytes graphics on here I know
that in a lot of cases you can't really
see the the VGA sticker but I'm going to
go ahead and say yeah I really like it
anyway
because it matters to me because I'm
shallow like that alright so in terms of
the overall look at the card
very similar to the 6870 we've got that
same distinctive black and white are
black and white red and black stripe
thing going on on the top of the part we
have a ventilation hole here so
something to be aware of and I did see
some comments about this in that build I
did in the fractal design define r3 with
two high end GPUs is that if you have an
exhaust here and you have a side fan
kind of over it you want to make sure
that's going out rather than like
pushing against the natural airflow
direction of the card so that was why I
had done it that way and we've also got
two cross fire bridges for support with
support for either up to 3-way crossfire
X okay here further let's look at the
power as well here we've got as I
mentioned before one six pin one eight
pin power connector so this is quite a
beefy card and there seems to be some
kind of a dip switch here that's
interesting I know that it can be used
for flashing the BIOS but I don't know
what else it's good for well we'll
figure that out later okay moving around
to the back of the card we've got the
same basic look here so it's going to
look quite sharp no matter what case you
install it in and then down at the
bottom of the card we find nothing of
note other than a PCI Express connector
now I love this shroud on the back of
the card is like the best idea ever
because I don't want to see you know
what you green or red or blue PCB you're
using know what just a nice black
shrouded heatsink functional looks great
I approve of this message and oh you can
see that there's actually two part
construction to the shroud that goes on
the front so there's the plastic part
and then this part appears to actually
be made of plastic can tell metal I'm
pretty sure it's metal because I think
that's part of the of the heatsink yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah the bottom part is
metal so that's part of the heatsink
that actually cools the vrm ram chips
all that other good stuff all right
let's move around to the business end of
the card where we will find all of our
connectivity options now bear in mind
you can't use all of these at the same
time so if you want to run three display
days that means you can run any two of
the DVI or HDMI and then at least one
DisplayPort if you want to run for
displays any two of these and two
DisplayPort so be aware of that multi
display you will probably need to use
DisplayPort at some point we've got a
half-open
PCI slot for ventilation so that
explains why they needed the extra
ventilation room here on the top of the
card so that you can exhaust so
basically this is kind of I'd consider
this a half-and-half between external
exhaust and internal exhaust so there's
not really much else to say about that
now oh this is interesting look at that
this card does not include a DVI to VGA
adapter so as per my recommendation that
if you're buying a high-end card you
should probably throw that VGA monitor
away gigabyte seems to have taken that
to heart and they don't think you need a
VGA adapter for this particular card
although I can tell you right now it
will work if you use an adapter from DVI
to VGA so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the Radeon HD 6970 and I'm
just going to turn off the camera for a
sec find out what this dip switches for
on the W die so it's something to do
with flashing the BIOS that's pretty
much all the details I have right now
