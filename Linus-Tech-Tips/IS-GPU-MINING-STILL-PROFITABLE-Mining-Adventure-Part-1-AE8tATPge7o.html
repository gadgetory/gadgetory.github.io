been completely tapped out thanks to
every gamers worst enemy miners and no
not young people who screech into the
microphone but they're awful too I'm
talking about the kind of miners who are
using Hardware both PC components and
more specialized equipment to calculate
what are called hashes for crypto
currencies like Bitcoin in exchange for
a reward effectively mining for money
but how do you get in on the action
can you just fire up your old PC and
start making money let's investigate
mass drop is now featuring their custom
configured AKG K 7x X audiophile
headphones check them and other drops
out at the link in the video description
let's get this out of the way first to
make a gold rush analogy the days of
walking on to a random plot of land you
know sticking your pickaxe scissors or
whatever into the nearest mountainside
and sailing home in a golden ship are
basically over
but just because mining the most popular
cryptocurrency Bitcoin is no longer
practical for the average person with a
an extra graphics card or two that
doesn't mean that you can't mind for
something so as always around here we
started our adventure with some overkill
hardware bringing our 10 GPU server out
of mothballs up from 8 gamers one CPU
theoretically 1080p eyes are the most
profitable but we have to ignore cost to
buy what do you mean ignore classes to
buy what do you think I'm like native
graphics card sneezies so then what we
ended up with is 5 dt x 10 70s for GTX
10 80s and then a single 1080 TI it's
not gonna be like the highest-earning
rig but we can use this to run some
important benchmarks and determine
whether our plan will be profitable I
guess we had to get upstairs
one trip yeah sure I was about to say
the same thing oh come on it's just like
complete disregard it's fine who cares I
care it's just it's fine like we're just
not gonna drop it so it doesn't matter
right you got because you never drop
anything ok here ok technically not the
way it's meant to be rolled I don't
think but Yolo we left it any higher so
I got my ankles ok thank you
oh don't shift it Pat you know I think
we actually could have said 11 in here
if we used the katana I think it
throttles a little bit I think might
hang on the katana would be a terrible
terrible idea
saying I think we could've well I do
this Jake's gonna work on installing the
whopping two sticks of memory out of the
24 slots on our board here
cryptocurrency mining doesn't really
benefit from a ton of RAM with that said
though it may benefit from a large
virtual memory space on your storage
drive and then he's also gonna throw in
two of our 22 core Xeon processors wait
I
yes I know that's really stupid they're
just the only two CPUs that we had lying
around that were compatible with this
board and we actually have to populate
both of the sockets for this because
otherwise we won't have enough PCI
Express Lanes for all of these freakin
GPUs are you struggling I don't have
enough do you have any more this tickets
less than four hours
AHA here and I was right oh it's cuz
he's here not because I had no
confidence and you're doing this by
yourself
ouch and you're gonna drive up all of
our insurance premiums when he has to go
to the fuck emergency and get that
inserted up and there we have it we are
now ready to boot up our system actually
almost cooling is sort of a concern in a
system like this so we're gonna go ahead
and throw our fans back in here and then
Jake are you ready with that shroud just
gotta get this gaff tape I'm stuck
wouldn't want to be wasteful you know
there's are you really reusing tape yeah
this tape is still sticky how cheap do
you think I am is this an yvonne
initiative I mean this chassis clearly
isn't designed to have graphics card um
yeah I don't know how we're gonna fit
this in here off of it I think you kind
of have to just cram the tip in between
two of them like it was made to fit come
on we used tape look it's not sticky I
told the gaff tape is amazing
I never told me that okay well gaff tape
is amazing so now we just need some
power okay 24 right oh right yeah
dori I planned for this we could have
easily done this experiment with just a
normal motherboard or 4G yeah but that
would've been so lame
it's like power me please look I'm
working on it okay please give me power
I'm failing come on okay we're in ready
well good ah yes slightly less annoying
where all the 62 degrees from right here
that was terminally unimpressive okay
there we go that's more like it that's
how you know it's working okay so while
we're waiting to fire up windows and
install the Nvidia driver which by the
way takes a long-ass time on a system
with 10 GPUs let's have a look at power
consumption we're looking at 400 watts
right now 400 watts and I though at idle
so basically no matter what kind of
hardware you're using mining is gonna
add a lot to your electrical bill so
it's this real cost that's associated
with it that prevents casuals from just
using old hardware to mine these days it
is all about efficiency
so our Pascal based cards consume a
similar amount of power compared to
previous generations but they run the
algorithms needed for mining much more
quickly than previous generations and
the more calculations that you can
perform per watt of power consumed the
more profitable
you'll be the other key is to mine
smarter almost no one is mining for
Bitcoin directly these days because over
time the difficulty of generating a
reward by mining goes up a lot so people
are opting instead to mined for an
altcoin
like litecoin aetherium z cash or even
dogecoin yes for the uninitiated that
was and is a real thing scratching the
table oh my god that got a lot heavier
I'm so happy I'm not carrying that side
that's fine I'll be on the bottom this
time oh wait I'm going backwards again
what the hell no you go backwards also I
just locked this door wait my elbow
needs to unlock it wait why are we
standing like this this is not a good
strategy yeah and you slide that way and
I'll slide this way yeah uh-huh I got it
if we drop it if it's not that big of a
deal hold on don't push holding sort of
counterintuitive other side is there it
is yep really are you serious yeah
holy that was painless so now that it's
installed the plan is to use a market
place called nice hash that pairs buyers
who want to rent hashing power with
sellers who have hashing power like us
so what's cool about that is that after
you run the included benchmark which can
actually take a few hours with this much
gear and had trouble with the 88 threads
worth of CPU that we're rocking in this
version of the software anyway it
determines which algorithm is most
profitable for which piece of your
hardware at any given moment and runs
that giving you a real-time readout of
how much you're earning before
electricity costs and then paying you
out daily as long as your balance is at
least point zero zero 1 of a Bitcoin
that is after taking their cut it's
booting right I think so
okay so over the weekend Jake I didn't
really help spent a bunch of time
babying this thing through crashes and
blue screens and we have finally got it
mining stabili TM we initially thought
that the issues might be related to
thermals because let's face it the cards
are really close together by the way
your ducting seems to be falling off if
you want to go have a look at that get
this letter in here what with
afterburner up on screen it's actually
pretty clear that our climate-controlled
server room has that under control we're
hitting 82 degrees top some of them are
a lot lower like 70 even but actually
that reminds me we haven't factored the
cost of air conditioning into our
profitability equation but that's
something that we can really look into
during part two of our investigation so
getting back to this machine you might
have noticed that there are actually
only eight GPUs in the system now see
that we pulled out the middle - that's
actually due to an Nvidia driver
limitation that specifies a maximum of
eight GPUs per operating system so shout
out to Gary over at asu's for that tip
so that means our final power usage is a
cool 2,000 watts
no biggie then for our remember for
power supplies let's talk about the
return on our investment to buy that
configuration would run you nearly 18
thousand US dollars at an average of
eleven dollars a day in profit again not
accounting for air conditioning it would
take around four and a half years to
recoup that and that is assuming
stability in the cryptocurrency market
stability
what stability in the cryptocurrency
market right what a joke so obviously
this would be a really stupid mining
setup to go out and buy however if you
were a little more how you say not a
complete idiot about your part selection
assuming that your power costs are
similar to ours at around 10 US cents
per kilowatt you could actually get your
upfront investment back a lot sooner so
we're gonna investigate a more optimized
config in a follow up video but this
config for about $5,000
that you're looking at right now is kind
of what we're planning let us know if
you have any suggestions in the comments
first let's get back to the original
question does what we're doing make any
sense
well if you have a bunch of spare modern
hardware lying around collecting dust
actually yes so we're planning to leave
that system running until Phase two when
will report on our results and then
compare it to our second system but if
you have to go out and actually buy
Hardware to do it your return is likely
going to take so long that you'd be
better off doing what many people are
doing and trying to buy and sell crypto
currencies more directly as they rise
and fall though there are certainly
risks associated with that as well so
why did everyone run out and buy all the
video cards and high-wattage power
supplies driving up prices for gamers
well while the profit isn't anything
earth-shattering many miners actually
resell their hardware when it's no
longer profitable recovering much of the
upfront cost and then keeping all the
money that was made while the systems
were in service so let us know in the
comments what you guys want to see in
future follow ups here because we have
hardly begun to explore this rabbit hole
we're planning a future build with 19
GPUs in one system so that's gonna be a
thing and we'd love to talk about Asics
as well those are pretty interesting but
we definitely want feedback from you
