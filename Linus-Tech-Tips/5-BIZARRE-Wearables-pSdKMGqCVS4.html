sponsored post for the tick watch - and
have just recently launched a new
Kickstarter for their Android wear
powered tick watch s and E they've got
every feature but the kitchen sink that
got me thinking the Smart Watch space
has really matured I mean these things
used to kind of suck you couldn't answer
phone calls track Fitness or check your
notifications on either iOS or Android
like you can with this thing but that
isn't to say that every category of
wearables have matured in the same way
that watches have what about other
wearables well funny story turns out
that question can take you down some
strange rabbit holes by using split head
phones which hang out of the vagina but
it's ok because I've saved you a trip to
that corner of the Internet and here
goes five bizarre wearables brought to
you by a normal one the tick watch -
number one I'm going to level with you
guys although I may have the behavior of
an immature donkey I also have the age
of a grown-ass man and frankly my hair
ain't what it used to be to be clear I'm
not complaining there are lots of people
my age who have it a lot worse but when
I saw the I grow hair growth system I
knew that I needed one first two
questions is it considered wearable tech
if you're never going to wear it outside
and is it still wearable tech if it has
an infomercial instead of a Kickstarter
campaign not sure but it goes on your
head and it uses low level light therapy
tech to help treat thinning and balding
hair results may vary near infrared
lasers transfer small amounts of energy
into the skin and apparently this
mechanism isn't completely hogwash but
that doesn't keep this 550 dollar unit
from feeling and even smelling a little
cheap and pretty uncomfortable I'll have
to get back to you guys in four months
with whether or not it works but what I
can tell you for now is that it does a
decent job of warming up your head and
that I appreciate that the folks at a
pure science were thoughtful enough to
let me route my own Tunes through the
otherwise inexplicable included
headphones oh and don't forget your I
grove volumizing shampoo and accelerate
35 spray because why not you're already
in for five hundred and fifty dollars so
go big or go bald right call them next
ten minutes and you'll get four bottles
for free number two how many times have
you found yourself fronting down the
boardwalk in your daisy dukes thinking
gee I sure wish these timeless country
cut-offs offered guiding vibrations to
help me navigate this concrete jungle
just me well now they can these
vibrating connected jeans include two
vibrating sensors on the belt one on the
left side and one on the right providing
useful haptic feedback like
left new message or step on it Sally
or you'll be late for the hoedown these
shaky shorts stay in sleep mode until
you put them on and are actually even
smart enough to stay asleep in the
washing machine enabling the battery to
last for up to four years long after
you've realized what a bad idea it was
to buy them number three if you think
wearables are for obnoxious young people
think again
driller systems has partnered with
Frances oldest industrial manufacturer
of Keynes
to tap into the large and lucrative
senior tech segment they're made for it
smart cane is the winner of a CES 2017
Innovation Award which really okay honey
way it uses embedded sensors and
artificial intelligence to learn its
users habits and then it detects
abnormal situations like Falls the GSM
connected cane then sends an email SMS
or even places a phone call to the users
caregiver who can then send a response
signal back to the cane all without
needing to be connected to a second
device that's huge because when my
grandpa leaves the house he can hardly
remember to bring his pants let alone
his phone I'm actually kind of getting
into this I feel bad for the smart canes
competitors this thing is so disruptive
they're not going to have a leg to stand
on number four this one's less of a
wearable and were vana insertable it's
the Kansas smart thermometer basically a
regular old thermometer that works
orally rectally or under the arm which
is a that's kind of a new one but anyway
it plugs directly into your phone and
sense it's readings to a very nice and
fleshed out companion app that tracks
temperature and symptom profiles and
lets you easily send them to your doctor
it's also kind of bendy which is hours
of fun for a simple man like me and
comes with this extension cord so you
can read temperatures from all kinds of
things number five the world's going to
crap and
just fear but the air too but that
doesn't mean your outfit has to
introducing where the world's first
pollution filtering respirator hidden
behind a chic French designed scarf the
replaceable filters stop particulate
matter as small as 0.1 micrometers while
the recycled polyester scarf keeps you
from looking like the Iron Chef of meth
whether you live in an apocalyptic
health cape or riding your scooter
through an office where is a breath of
fresh air or so they say so then to
answer our original question yes other
wearables definitely do exist but for
the time being it's likely that wrist
warm ones will be the most common so
