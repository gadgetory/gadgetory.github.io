book that I have and if you jumped to
the same conclusion as my wife and
thought to yourself that hound dogs
scoundrel then I'm flattered but you're
overestimating the effect that YouTube
internet fame has on members of the
opposite sex or on members of the same
sex for that matter nope I don't have
that kind of black book I'm afraid my
black book is a gaming laptop from venom
and while it is pretty sexy
the closest thing it contains to the
phone numbers of members of the opposite
sex is a bookmark for live links calm

now to learn more so let's kick things
off with a bit of who the devil are
these guys about venom they're a small
Australian gaming laptop company that
caught my attention by making some
pretty eyebrow raising claims with
respect to the performance and quality
of their products my initial response to
their request for a review was a chilly
well I'm sure it's fine but frankly I'm
not really sure what someone who isn't a
tier one manufacturer can contribute to
the category at this point but they
insisted that if I gave it a chance I
would be impressed and sent me this the
venom Black Book 15 so what makes a
black book special then anyway their
overall sales aren't large enough for a
worldwide exclusive chassis so according
to venom anyway it's the finishing
touches configuring fan behavior
creating the OS image which they include
on a USB Drive instead of a hard drive
prepetition thank you sourcing their own
LCD panels sourcing their own keyboard
key switches sourcing their own memory
and drives and I was skeptical about
this one at first but apparently one
advantage of their lower volume
requirements is that they can
exclusively opt for lower yield a grade
materials for the construction of their
products and it actually seems to make a
difference because the finished product
really is unexpectedly nice there were a
lot of ways that a company with the name
venom could have gone overboard on the
all-flash no - gamer II look designed to
appeal to the
that needs to ask their parents for a
new gaming machine but the black book 15
is all business from the outside with a
good mix of i/o including optical out
dedicated headphone and microphone jacks
an SD slot a SIM slot unusual here in
Canada 2 USB 3 ports and an Intel
gigabit port on the right another USB 3
port HDMI out and dual mini DisplayPort
1.2 ports and some ventilation on the
left and a curiously positioned eSATA /
USB 3 port and some more ventilation on
the back to go along with the power jack
so the overall takeaway holding it in my
hands is reassuringly premium aluminum
unibody construction stealthy blasted
black anodized finish and well horses to
spare once you get under the hood
because spec wise all current black book
fifteens have an Intel Core i7 47 10 HQ
quad core processor geforce gtx 970m
graphics a one terabyte two and a half
inch hard drive for mass storage in
Windows 8.1 then there are three
different tiers to get more or less ram
and SSD space depending on how much you
want to pay I've got the mid tier one
with the 256 gig m2 SSD and 16 gigs of
ram but the lowest n1 has that and the
highest end one doubles it but chassis
and specs aren't even really what's
supposed to be interesting about this
thing so let's get into what that is
sitting in front of it the first thing I
noticed is the gorgeous 3k 2880 by 1620
I P S matte display man this thing is
nice deep blacks vibrant colors minimal
glow a must if you're going to run at
this resolution without scaling as
expected motion blur for an on TN panel
and fantastic viewing angles the next
thing I noticed was the OS and while
their windows image does have a fair bit
of stuff installed out of the factory
most of it is what I would classify as
useful rather than bloat there's a
Resident Evil six benchmark for example
that they presumably use for validation
that everything is working correctly a
screen evaluation utility that I
immediately fired up to determine that I
have no dead pixels and that other than
a touch of backlight lead at the top and
bottom edges it looks terrific Firefox
and Chrome browsers a copy of DivX
player which isn't like
favorite third-party player but
prevented me from ever having to see the
horrible modern UI video player and
finally a copy of Norton AntiVirus and
internet security which normally I would
blast them for but since they have the
consideration to at least include a full
year of service rather than some BS
trial like the Tier one guys are doing
these days
I guess we'll call that a draw their
control center utility is fairly bare
bones but is lightweight and does what I
need it to do there are toggle buttons
for most onboard stuff and quick
configuration for fan profiles including
the ability to create a custom profile
if you wanted to you know turn the fan
speed way up and overclock the GPU or
something something I didn't end up
playing around with because the stock
config had the internals topping out at
70 degrees Celsius while also staying
reasonably quiet I mean we've got it
running full bore right now and it
doesn't have that annoying whine to it
that some that some gaming notebooks do
which I guess leads pretty well into the
overall gaming experience the black book
15 strikes in my mind an excellent
balance between notebooks that trade
away their slimness for being powerful
cool and quiet like Asus is g7 51 and
notebooks that trade away their coolness
and quietness for being extremely slim
and powerful like MSI SGS 60 stealth
this one is equally powerful but
carrying it or using it feels like it's
striking more of an even balance between
noise heat and thickness speaking of
even balances the 3k panel is a total of
four point six seven megapixels which is
another compromise that I mostly agree
with 4k at 8.25 megapixels would have
obviously been too much for this and
really any notebook GPU to drive today
and 1080p is decidedly last gen at this
point so I see why they did it but my
complete here is one for panel makers
rather than for venom because while the
black books 970m
is enough to handle even most triple-a
games at medium or better at native res
I wish that 1440p notebook displays were
available because that would give a
little bit more breathing room for
future games at native res with out
without running at a lower res and
dealing with interpolation let's move on
to the keyboard now though
stuff wasn't too noteworthy the layout
commits no major sins but isn't
exceptional and the backlight is a nice
feature but it's not super bright or
anything but the feel of it was pretty
unusual honestly a little stiff for my
tastes but given that this is a low
profile notebook keyboard that we're
talking about the tactile feedback is
excellent and while at first I bemoaned
the lack of macro Keys Venom includes a
utility even though it is a bit buggy
that allows any key to be rebound with
another key or a macro not bad so
conclusion time is this notebook good
that is is it really good actually yeah
is it the kind of product that I would
love to carry around with the fit and
finish that's closer to what I'd expect
from Apple or Razer than to your typical
plastic gaming PC notebook yeah but is
it worth the price well that's your call
but with the words razor and Apple
having just rolled off my tongue I think
you already know that the black book 15
is not going to be a bargain-basement
gaming machine so ultimately
that call has to be yours as usual we'll
have links in the video description for
price comparison guys thank you for
