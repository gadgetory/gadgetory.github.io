networking may be a fairly new category
for a soos that does not prevent them
from innovating now I have whined and
complained about AC I think enough times
we showcased a USB AC adapter that was
capable of something like 60% of the
performance of just some random and 450
adapter we had lying around I mean come
on if you're gonna call it 1200 megabit
per second and it uses USB 2 which is
480 megabits per second I think we got a
problem here this is the PC EAC 66 this
is AC the way it's meant to be
implemented the way it needs to be
implemented AC is not ready to be a USB
adapter yet it needs beefy antennas it
needs cooling and it needs power so this
is PCI Express it has an external
adapter and it is capable of running at
AC 1750
so once the next draft standard comes
out this will be fast enough to go with
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate Technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys
incremental product revisions thank you
slick that are coming on the router side
so you'll be able to fully leverage the
power and performance of your AC
hardware
check out that heatsink always good
design with these guys you got that
awesome now not everyone is concerned
about the highest performance wireless
solution in the world so maybe you want
something that's a range extender you
know easy to use range extender you got
your WPS set up here you got your power
switch you know it looks pretty looks
pretty normal looks pretty normal
oh oh okay it's dreams music from your
computer BAM or your tablet okay it's a
nightlight BAM so I mean hey if you're
if you're gonna have you know range
extenders all over the place you might
as well have some additional
functionality that they're providing to
your household so I think that's pretty
cool this is the RP and fifty-three
range extender I mean this is the kind
of thing that sort of gets the youtuber
in me so it kind of excited because
everyone wants me to do a video about
their range extender but the unfortunate
truth is that there's not a whole lot to
say about range extenders they do what
they say they do they extend your range
you plug it in and now we have an
exciting range extender this range
extender not only allows you to continue
using your tablet as you walk around
your house at night you won't trip down
the stairs holding your tablet right
don't miss any of our CES 2013 coverage
make sure you're subscribed to Linus
tech tips and we'll see you guys with
lots more videos from the show thanks
