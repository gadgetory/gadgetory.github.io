description to learn more welcome
friends to free geek Vancouver we got a
couple of videos planned here but for
this first one we're going to be taking
you guys on a tour of what it looks like
where they reduced reuse we build
recycle and resell we sell computers
electronics like that they have
everything here I got like 2.4 gigahertz
802.11 B wireless I got a Sony Walkman a
an FM TV that's that a jam box this
thing was never any good a whole bit of
circuit boards whoo
cuz why not so let's have a look around
first off we have the data destruction
station so this thing I don't actually
know what this is called probably just a
press I don't know it probably is more
technical name than that but oh well
basically you just pull this thing down
it punctures through your hard drive
like what Linus has on display isn't it
this was left of the platters inside so
this is monitor sorting land you can see
we've got whoo it's a 19-inch VGA DVI
but how do we know it works so this is
cool they've actually got a KTM set up
here and then they've just got a test
machine here that allows them to run the
monitors for I think it is 30 minutes or
something along those lines and then
they can determine are they working are
they not and decide whether they end up
in the store here we have small
dismantle and circuit board preparation
basically what they do here is take
things apart that are small so you have
a lot of like motherboard batteries give
little motors for different things like
hard drives you have magnetic coils for
different things and all this kind of
stuff gets prepared because you're
looting certain valuable things off of
it and the circuit board preparation is
for stuff that goes into here because
these get recycled where they take out
the gold and the platinum and all the
valuable things off the board and make
some money off of it to fund free geek
this is PC dismantle and there's a few
rules no loose side paddles ever
anywhere and I have definitely had this
problem at our office so I totally get
it so this is the pile of all the
computers that we've actually dismantled
most of today so
guys are going to be able to check that
out in our vlog we've got Nikki V taken
apart okay not like that we are not
barbarians Nikki V so basically you sort
everything into aluminum steel scrap
copper CPUs check that out
ram circuit boards motherboards my fins
Oh Thank You Dennis
good job Dennis and optical and whatever
this is drives the bernoulli 230 this is
component disassembly you get stuff like
routers optical drives speakers whatever
and then take them to this table over
here or you can see this one's even
partway through assembly this was our
disassembly this is a tape drive which
are actually pretty expensive but it's
broken so it's getting taken apart take
things out like the like the magnets and
whatnot strip them down into raw
materials where we have steel and
plastic over there and then we have
circuit boards up here which are taking
for their copper gold or platinum or
whatever this feels just taking for raw
steel here they're recycling by oh yeah
straight up recycling I guess
in here we've got memory land so this is
where they sort and cast all of the RAM
from the disassembly station so you can
see they've got this is this is so cool
this like wall-mounted memory testing
system that they got here ddr2 and ddr3
and then they sort it into all the
different working capacities and speeds
this is actually more RAM than I have
ever seen in one place anywhere in my
life they have some cool stuff in here
like they've got all these FB dims so
this is older server memory I mean check
this out
I remember these Oh seizing Reaper
Edition now with heat pipe cooling
everything is so well organized and
documented here it is so cool so there's
like this awesome chart of like here's
all the different types of RAM pretty
much pretty much ever the blank spot for
ddr4 I suspect they don't get a lot of
scrap ddr4 oh this is hard drive so Ram
is right behind you Linus just walk you
guys through that one this is hard drive
so they have these like custom-made
wooden hard drive holders which are
actually pretty sick they use them at
all their stations they kind of
zombified their computers so they have
SATA power and data coming out of the
front so they can hook up as many drives
as they want this station is the wiping
station they run Derrick's boot and you
can just wipe the drive so much that
someone wouldn't realistically be able
to very easily get the data off of it
then it goes to blank Drive so once it's
done being wiped comes down here to
blank there isn't that many blank ones
right now there's just a 200 gig IDE
then it goes up into in the installation
station where they have the same kind of
zombified computers with cables hanging
out the front and they install Ubuntu
right now they're thinking about moving
to Mint I supported that move so maybe
they'll actually do that and then they
install the same thing on all these
drives so that's free open-source
software which they support a lot
because things that are cheaper good for
them and then these are prepped and
ready to go to the system setup area we
have what Taryn and John are currently
working on which is actually the final
setup of well almost the final setup of
one of the systems you take note of
what's in it if it's actually
functioning properly do stuff like a
stress test you make sure that it's
clean you take note of how many slots
are there for different things right
your name give the system a name whatnot
and then that's basic QC it has one more
round of QC right after that before it
goes up and into the store what what
what what what but not but seriously
welcome to the thrift shop so this is
where all the refurbished stuff from out
there ends up so in here you can buy
well pretty much anything that you saw
out there except piecemeal or whole
systems and I think they sell themselves
a little bit short here I mean we have
more types of rennes and CPUs available
please ask for assistance yeah they do
we have definitely seen it not everyone
wants to buy bear components though and
they've actually got a wide variety of
different systems everything from like
Core 2 duos that are 50 bucks or you can
actually just work a few hours here as a
volunteer and you can take one of these
puppies home all the way up to more
expensive stuff like this Mac Pro with
dual quad-core xeon or this Intel Core
i7 actually fairly capable gaming rig
all for pretty reasonable prices so that
is how luke performed so well in the
last scrapyard Wars there's some other
very cool stuff in the store that's
probably not for sale like this vintage
AB FedEx can water cooled computers I
mean that looks like I think that's a
not a TD accent to NZXT or something
like that from danger den now-defunct I
mean look at this thing
look at this look at this stuff it's
unbelievable
just like Depeche Mode in here this is
this predates the AOL CD they have other
stuff up here as well that aren't just
normal computers including this which is
a up to 100 foot range 256 bit AES
encrypted Wireless mechanical keyboard
with cherry black switches on it which
is actually pretty sick and it's just
under a hundred bucks which is badass
they have like shows and stuff so you
can get the office they have the first
four seasons of the office they have
some games over behind me there's
individual component stuff like optical
drives behind the desk you can buy
things like motherboards
and CPUs you pretty much get hooked up
but you might have noticed the laptops
in the thrift store we never showed
where those came from this is the laptop
lab this is actually one of the big
moneymakers for free gig not to say that
it's a for-profit Society I'm just
saying that they have to keep the lights
on and the bills paid somehow and this
department is a big part of it so in
here they've got their uh-huh this is
all the we know their stuff wrong with
this this is the issues laptops over
here these are the ones that are ready
to build so ready to replace batteries
replace RAM replace drives or maybe just
be a thrown out as a waste like this
pretty ba looking Panasonic rugged
computer here this over here is testing
stations where you can see they're using
you know industry standard tools like
mem test for example to make sure that
everything's going hunky-dory over here
and then once it's all done in this room
check this out my friends this over here
is actually an incoming pile but this
over here is the stacks on stacks on
stacks on stacks of finished laptop
computers that are ready to go out to
the store or to people who need them
speaking of actually nothing because I'm
in a different place doing a different
thing ting comm ting is the mobile
carrier that actually has a phone which
if you think about it it kind of makes
sense I mean if their entire business is
providing people with phones you'd think
people will be able to take those phones
dial a number and speak to an actual
person yes my friends an actual person
will pick up the phone and talk to you
if you have any kind of issue so let's
say you don't have an issue so you're
not on 10 yet you want to know if it
will make any sense head over to Linus
ENCOM we've got that linked in the video
description and try out their savings
calculator ting charges you only for the
airtime that you use and the average
ting bill is only $24 a month if you use
their savings calculator you enter your
last few bills on your existing plan and
you find out if you will save money on
ting and even better than that they will
pay 25% up to $75 of your contracts
cancellation fee and if you use our link
you'll get another 25 bucks off your
bill
or in device credit so head over to
Linus ENCOM and check it out today okay
so that's pretty much it for today we're
going to have a vlog coming up showing
everyone working at all the stations
here at free geek and for now though
we're actually setting up to shoot the
when show live here at free geek
hopefully we have all of our equipment
and there are no technical difficulties
yeah right but I'm not going to count
necessarily on that so thanks for
watching guys if you just like this
video hit that dislike button but if you
liked it hit like you get subscribed or
maybe even consider supporting us you
can buy a cool shirt like this one you
can get oh yeah you can join our that
forum thing that we run where you can
get answers about your technology
questions and become a contributor there
you can even just use our affiliate code
when you shop that Amazon instructions
for which are up there so not yeah that
too and now that you're done watching
this video and you're wondering what to
watch next maybe check out I always
struggle with this what's a video we did
recently southern gamers one CPU update
yes that's the one check that out up
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
