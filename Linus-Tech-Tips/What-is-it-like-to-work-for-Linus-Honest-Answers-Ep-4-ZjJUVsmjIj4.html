Group well I think it's great I've seen
my name's on the building yeah how that
feels locking up in like yeah my name is
on the building but if you want the real
answer you'll probably have to ask the
poor Schmucks who do the actual grunt
work around here so we made a deal they
said if you agree not to watch the video
we will give the viewers the real honest
answer and I kind of went okay
the be quiet pure bass 600 features a
versatile design noise insulation and
optimization for different liquid cooled
radiator configurations learn more at
the link below I remember thinking this
guy is so quirky psychotic petite
hyperactive insanity yeah
somewhat like insane slightly insane
like how much insane I mean we're not
we're not dead in the water yet so I got
their 501 no answer and my first
thoughts are holy crap this guy is so
intent that I'm a minute late for my
interview he walks up shot leaves
doesn't even consider me he's coming at
you with all this energy and all this
Drive and you just kind of have to match
that like has no semblance of personal
time and is more than willing to like
spend every hour of his life working -
as a leader I think has always been
specifically good at inspiring drastic
action and he transforms that once
you're already here to inspire
gratuitous amounts of overtime that may
or may not be Linus had this idea to
make videos about building computers to
level that no one else had ever tried to
make so this is our first build guide it
took us like 18 hours close down the
retention arm a little bit of strength
required here I think we finished at
like 4 a.m. I have never regretted
anything more than taking the job at
lattice Media Group for the first two
weeks and after that things got a lot
better we had so much work to do
Linus is very decisive but he was very
vague in his decisiveness he doesn't
really know how you're going to do
something just what you're going to do
when Linus tells you that something will
be done in two hours I always double the
amount of time in
I had and more often than not I am
correct quite a bit of fun to work for
in like a constantly disorganized and a
bit wacky kind of way so I've never used
a reciprocating saw and it's plugged in
I had kind of weird Manta - like I said
not working with my much I get demands I
can paint my face can you find this can
you that so that's a leader I think it's
very random and interesting so I never
heard one of my bosses like fart audibly
from across the office before but if
you're wondering at any point if we're
actually as unorganized and incompetent
as we seem on camera it's it's actually
like that we're not faking that and
actually - for a mistake I mean
everything about - was a mistake but
this in particular filling was last I
was a mistake he had like the Genki of
setup and as I walk away the test bench
fell and probably the scariest Nilla my
life - comes back everything's on the
floor
we lost the footage of something that
had been shot earlier where Linus was
installing something his attic
lives was definitely yelling and
swearing like I've broke him some stuff
accident before and he was mad but
that's like really short you know short
bursts of anger
it's very rare where you're freaking out
and I'm not I only freaked out when it's
really really bad whenever he's like no
no it's okay and then he walked through
eight what that's the GPS antenna yes oh
okay everything is fine everything is
fine and I am calm and once he gets to a
certain boiling point you can just you
can feel it the kind of mad where he
gets really high-pitched and does I was
doing the land dock and I messed up one
of the topics and he came upstairs and
he just said you're fired and I didn't
know if he was joking or not so I just
continued working and everything went
fine and then about a week later I
accidentally copyright strike tower
Channel and then Linus said you're fired
and I thought that time maybe he was
serious because you know I looked down
the whole channel single-handedly I've
had some terrible terrible bosses
sometimes you know I've been able to get
one either like a boss who knew what
they were doing or like a boss who like
cares about people but getting both of
those together has been a new experience
he's really professional like an
efficient like he doesn't like to waste
time nothing is not willing to do things
entirely the wrong way for the sake of
finishing this video right now after 30
minutes of me sitting out front of the
door just waiting for somebody to like
answer the door he calls me and he goes
oh I completely forgot about her
interview in lines like this questions
is stupid this one's dumb I don't want
to ask this one and they puts it puts
down the paper and goes all right are
you into bestiality
do you watch bestiality I was like the
25th person to get interviewed a lot of
time he got to me and I was last I think
he had a real shred regimen of what he
wanted to get through and he probably
didn't have any time or energy to waste
on any bullsh excuse me he's like yeah
you heard me I'm like ah no and he's
like ah just messing with you
he found my Twitter and read all of my
tweets ask me why tweeted that what that
meant who I follow I follow them so that
was a little bit aside for me it was
fine but a little bit strange the first
interaction I had with Linus actually on
the phone was my first interview it was
at an Indian restaurant with his
children
it was kind of like a first date but
someone brought along a baby the whole
thing was full of really bad jokes so a
lot of nervous laugh and stuff like that
yeah it was like an interview but I
didn't know it was an interview I was
just literally there to have lunch with
him one of the things that I actually
liked about the relationship that lion I
have is I can no filter and he can no
filter and everyone's fine when we're
done when I started he didn't really
know what he was doing I didn't really
know what I was doing and we both kind
of grew into figuring that out
under this stupid thing and then undo
this others do a ridiculous thing they
are using
I'm sure there's stuff that comes up
that catches him off-guard or whatever
but he seems to be pretty on top of
everything at all times very well
prepared for everything that comes up
I hate when he's right he hates when I'm
right what we're both often right about
the things that were respectively
working on and that balance is fun and
also frustrating I'm pretty sure I've
only probably talked to him one-on-one
for maybe about I want to say 15 minutes
been here for two years because he's
just so busy just back and forth it's
kind of like hide and seek I always need
to find him on the car ride to or from
somewhere is when we can actually talk
about whatever so that's when you
actually get to know him as a person
whereas when we're all at work there's
really time for nothing else but working
certainly years I kind of saw Linus as
like the crazy maniac and I was just
trying to help them do whatever it was
trying to achieve but recently because
I've taken on managerial roles he's more
of a teacher than before and I don't
want to turn into him but I'd like to to
steal some of his skills it's a lot more
structured here than I think a lot of
people would assume compared to the
beginning things are a lot more
corporate it seems like we're a lot less
mobile or agile to just change
directions there's intense meetings then
there's deep
statistical analysis all this kind of
stuff which doesn't make it feel as like
fun
it's actually really refreshing to have
a working relationship with somebody
who's well the CEO of the company but
you know we're working together side by
side he understands the value of
spending good money on employees and
equipment so that's the product that we
make which is videos in this case is
good
a hundred and thirty-eight thousand US
dollars for two red cameras and the
Bulls accessories that they make you buy
$60,000 in hard drives to store all this
crap on another $20,000 in nvme SSD so
that all of our editors can edit red
footage off of arnav's at the same time
you know he cares you know he cares
about all of us that work here he cares
about you guys watching and he's just
he's just a loving father I don't know I
mean he said he's not going to watch it
I suppose everyone knows I was gonna
watch this and then he's going to come
around be like so heard you think I say
it's final retirement of that I always
felt that a leader should ride a horse
and I've never seen him on horseback so
I guess if I were going to say one thing
that Linus could do to improve himself
as a leader in my eyes is I'd like to
see him on a horse more it would make me
feel a lot more at ease
