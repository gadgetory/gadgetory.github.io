from Cougar this is from their 6x series
so it is the 6x r 9b b it is a black
case now we unboxed a power supply from
Cougar a little while back but this is
the first case that we're going to be
looking at from them it is part of their
gaming series and as I mentioned in the
power supply unboxing
even though cougar is a relatively new
brand you'll he'll have seen many
products on the market in the kate's and
power supply categories from their
parent company which is 18 feet Compu
case so they've been manufacturing cases
for a lot longer than Cougar has been
around so go ahead for protection and it
also has a pretty good full casing
around it so you can see this about an
inch and a half thick on all sides which
means that your cougar will arrive in
100% condition I mean unless you're
shipping from like Canada to just Becca
stanner
yeah if you really you really go really
far out there then yeah you probably
won't have too much success but yeah
let's go ahead and pull off the scratch
resistant cover and then there we have
it I saw this case initially around the
time of I believe by CBS so it's been
quite a while since I've heard about it
and since it's even been on the market
and leading up until the point where
I've actually had a chance to have a
look at it so the first thing I'm doing
here is I'm just removing the masking
tape and protect their phones so there's
not
and they put some some foam pieces in
between the front door and the front
bezel of the case just to make sure that
it's not going to open and shut during
transport and cause any problems for you
there so let's go ahead and get all that
step removed all right so the front of
the case is quite clean looking actually
we've got one two three four five six
five and a quarter inch drive base which
you can see can be easily removed with
these latches right here
there are oh that's kind of interesting
so for the talk to they've gone ahead
and removed the metal covers but for the
bottom ones you'll have to go ahead and
remove those yourself they fit back in
just like that and then down at the
bottom you can see we've actually got er
a filtered cover for a 120 millimeter
fan mount so you can see there's mesh in
the front then with a fan filter so you
can easily take this out top it off
clean it out and then replace it there
yeah the rest of the front of the case
you can see there's more mesh once you
close the front door and this is
actually quite nice there's a bit of a
brushed finish to the metal here and
then you've got some chrome accents and
so the front of the case looks very
clean very stylish and then you have a
front lock so that you won't have people
turning on your can be no the power and
the reset are up at the top so you won't
have people opening up your drives if
you want to lock the front of it so
there's a couple of scuffs on the front
but those are actually okay though they
come off no problem there's some glossy
stuff here that I hadn't seen before
and let's look at what we got on the
front so we have a power and reset
switch two USB 2.0 ports front audio as
well as an eSATA port so we've pretty
much got all of the essentials there
then moving along to the top of the case
we've got three more more matched bit of
an angled look to it overall and on the
side this actually kind of reminds me of
the cooler master 830 the stacker 830
which is a bit of an older case but it's
the it's reminiscent of this so it
doesn't have a window but the mesh side
is actually quite clear you can see
through it very easily so I'm gonna go
ahead and start it hold my hand behind
it so you can see how clear it is so if
you do put some case lighting inside
this thing you're going to have a pretty
good success seeing the components that
you're trying to light up all right here
we have accessories that are included we
also have internal cables and wiring and
let's just go ahead and sort of sort
this out when we try and get too much
further into this we can have a quick
look at the back of the case actually
not pretty nondescript back here we've
got 120 millimeter or 140 millimeter fan
mount we've got a space for the i/o
shield we've got seven expansion ports
as well as space for a standard ATX
power supply the case keys are fastened
to the back of the case so that you will
not lose them and inside let's have a
look at what we got so we have four
spots for three and a half inch drives
and then you can see there are also
included mounting points for a two and a
half inch SSDs so you can either use the
tool free mounts right here and you can
see these are quite flexible but as soon
as you put a hard drive in it those will
stiffen right up and they'll hold
themselves in much better I've seen
mechanisms like this before they are
quite effective you can actually remove
the whole three-and-a-half inch hard
drive cage if you want and I guess that
would enable you to install longer
graphics cards if you so desired what I
actually do in my own case is I have a
tune a half inch drive I don't have any
three and a half inch drives in my case
anymore and I have a to the half inch
drive velcro it out of the way and then
I I've completely removed all the three
and a half inch mounting bays in my case
just for better cooling more openness
and for better overall airflow so we've
got an included 120 millimeter fan in
the front although there is no included
fan in the back so it looks like
compiicate cougar rather has opted to go
for a bottom front to top there you see
we have what appears to be a 140
millimeter fan in the top airflow design
so you can add more fans you're gonna
have your power supply running here so
most modern power supplies have a
20 or 135 millimeter fan and the bottom
so you'll have airflow coming from the
front of the case going towards the back
so you can add a fan here as well and
then exhausting also out the top now
we've got tool free mounting mechanisms
in here for the five and a quarter inch
base which you will pull to unlock and
then actually let me have a look at how
this works okay actually that's that's
really straightforward then all you do
yeah oh when you slide the drive in it
locks itself that's neat so you can see
there's a tab on the back shoot I'm not
sure if you're gonna be able to see that
anyway there's a plastic tab on the back
here so as soon as you slide the drive
in it'll put the bolt into the side of
the five and a quarter inch drive so
that's pretty neat and then let me see
if there's anything else I want to talk
about really briefly here you've got PCI
tool free slot retention mechanism so I
guess we can start to find out how those
work as well you might want to give me a
minute with these ones we figured it out
there are instructions right here
because apparently cougar knows that
that's going to be difficult so all you
do in whoops okay well to put it in you
just press on the top of the PCI slot
and then slip it in under the latch
there and then just pull it out you do
that so it's not that complicated after
all usually I don't use these tools free
PCI mechanisms anyway because whenever
you have dual PCI slot cards there they
usually don't work anyhow so yeah
there's not that much benefit to it
basically the inside lacks cable
management's a little bit but I mean
you've got a covered side panel so it's
not windowed so as long as you've got
sleeved wires things aren't gonna stand
out too much and then you've also got a
pretty snazzy-looking front bezel so
overall I'd say the appearance gets a
pretty good rating from myself here's
all of the hardware that needs to be
included for mounting your motherboard
drives and other things and then last
but not least okay they've actually
included a five and a quarter inch to
three and a half inch bay adapter so
just in case you still use a floppy
drive or if you buy a three and a half
inch card reader or anything like that
they've gone ahead and included that and
hopefully that matches the front style
now I'm not quite that's alright so then
you can install a three and a half inch
and a quarter inch media card reader or
anything else do you require thank you
