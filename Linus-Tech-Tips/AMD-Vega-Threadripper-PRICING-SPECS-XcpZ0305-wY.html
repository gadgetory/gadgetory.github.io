for two of the most exciting products to
come out of the company in years Rison
thread Ripper and rx
Vega now obviously I wasn't able to be
at the tech day because I was busy with
the rest of my team hosting our
first-ever LTX tech carnival but AMD
provided me the briefing materials and
alienware sent over this area 51 so that
I could show off both AMD's
top-of-the-line 19 50 X 16 core 32
thread processor and a prototype of the
RX Vega 64 limited edition from this
park bench
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel there the simple VPN app search
your 7-day free trial at the link in the
video description let's start with Vega
the bulk of graphics cards actually sell
for under $300 but that doesn't mean
that there's no value to having an
enthusiast offering enthusiasts
recommend hardware to their less
enthusiastic friends so if you're AMD
every rx Vega you sell might sell a 560
or 3 so to compete in this space
AMD says they went back to the drawing
board on a lot of things a brand new
pixel engine brand new geometry engine
support for rapid packed math to
accelerate the rendering of objects that
don't benefit from higher precision and
eight gigs of state-of-the-art HBM to
memory with up to an unbelievable 484
gigabytes per second of bandwidth the
entry-level card called Vega 56 contains
only 56 of their next-gen compute units
versus 64 in the higher-end SKUs it's
air-cooled consumes about a hundred and
50 watts
according to rumors full benchmarks will
follow when the review embargo lifts and
seems to be positioned against the gtx
1070 at 399 stand alone while the
top-tier vega 64 is available in two
configurations an air-cooled version at
fifteen forty six megahertz boost and up
to a rumored three hundred watts and a
water-cooled one at sixteen seventy
seven boost and I hope this isn't right
up to four hundred watts of power
consumption as for pricing for this one
it gets a little complicated out of the
gate Andy is offering what they're
calling Radeon packs so two games that
vary by region the Germany version might
contain prey and sniper elite rather
than Wolfenstein 2 for example $200 off
of an ultra wide Samsung's three sync
monitor and $100 off a rise in seven CPU
and motherboard combo
Andy is touting this as up to 420
dollars of value and it seems like it's
adding about $100 to the price that you
pay based on the entry level pack with
Vegas 56 and I guess all I can say is I
hope that you the consumer think that's
a good deal because at launch while this
limited-edition brushed metal shroud is
available it's likely that the only way
you'll be able to buy a Vegas 64 is with
a bundle this annoying restriction
appears to be an attempt to ship cards
to gamers rather than just wiping out
all their inventory to coin miners so at
least I can see that AMD's heart is in
the right place but I'd like to hear
what you guys in the comments think
about that on to rise and thread Ripper
this one is both simpler and more
complicated in some ways it's simple
because we have a pretty good idea of
what to expect based on the specs the
1950 ex is a 16 432 thread three point
four gigahertz based 4 gigahertz boost
quad channel ddr4 monster so given that
we're already familiar with single
threaded vent performance at a given
frequency and then multi-core scaling
across CCX units the only real question
mark left is how the quad channel memory
enabled by AMD's use of 4 CC X's instead
of 2 will affect then performance and if
I had to guess I'd say that's going to
be a really good thing
now it's complicated because it's hard
to assign value to these high-end
desktop parts in traditional ways at
$1000 the 1950 X is not a great value
for gaming in the sense that an
overclocked rise in 5 for a fraction of
the cost will perform very similarly or
even better but from a content creation
data science and mega tasking
perspective it's a total GameChanger
and it's pricing is a big part of that
story over the last couple of
generations Intel has
inched up the pricing of its flagship
consumer processors in an apparent
attempt to avoid cannibalizing the
lucrative xeon lineup an A &amp;amp; D says nope
they're launching two other chips here
the 1920 X is a 12 core variant with
similar clock speeds but that one's not
that interesting to me I think an extra
200 bucks for four more cores is a great
deal by the time you're dropping fat
stacks of money on an X 399 motherboard
and a cooler that's going to have to
handle a rumored 180 watt and they're
also launching an 8 core 1900 X this one
is actually more interesting to me
because even though it has the same core
count as arisin 7 if you're building a
workstation or compute box you might not
need a ton of CPU and 550 bucks is a
phenomenal value for the quad-channel
memory controller and more importantly
64 PCI Express Lanes
and that's to run pretty much as many
GPUs as you want without running into
bandwidth limits so in summary then to
gamers unless you're parkour into CPU
encoding your twitch streams while you
play which we will be testing in our
full review it's not too relevant but to
folks like me rise and thread Ripper
looks like a game changer want to get an
AMD graphics card of your own we're
going to have a link to where to buy
