may not be glamorous but it's certainly
useful this is the trend net TK 204 UK -
port DVI USB KVM switch with audio kit
slick bought one because he'd never
heard of a KTM can't believe I'm just
messing with ya so it's pretty technical
he'd heard of a KTM kit before TV I'm
switched before I see I called it a KTM
kit it's not even what it is it's really
late at night guys here we are in the
studio bringing you unboxings of
champions so slick on this one because
we have one for our tech tip setup which
has been working really well for us so
the way it okay you okay we're not going
to focus too much on this one we'll
focus on this one but slick in his
infinite wisdom managed to find it
useful in spite of the fact that he
configured it wrong see what you're
supposed to do is plug this okay no
really there's a reason that he didn't
plug in the KB ins DVI cable and plug in
a separate DVI cable
now let's blame that as well so let's
actually get started with the unboxing
so you can get kvms in a wide variety of
different configurations including ones
that support two computers to be
controlled with a single set of
peripherals ones that support for
computers even rackmount ones that
support many computers operating off a
single keyboard and mouse and then you
switch between them according to
whichever one you want to control you
can get ones that use VGA and ps2 you
can get ones that use DVI and USB you
can get ones that do support audio and
ones that don't for a consumer who
happens to have a couple computers at
their desk whether you've got a PC and a
Mac and you don't feel like dual booting
and waiting for os's to load in between
a lot of our graphic designers here at
work do that or whether you have two
desktop computers one that is like a
medicated video rendering box and one
that you acted that you use for gaming
for example if you have them both of the
same desk this allows you to with the
touch of a button
switch between which one you want to
control and here at any given moment so
this guy includes everything you need
and this is the one that I consider to
be most practical for probably 90% of
consumers so it comes with a wide
variety of things here including all of
these packages that I have to open one
by one in order to bring you this
fantastic unboxing of a KVM all right
here we go
power ok so the first thing the things
we don't need utility install users
guide if you really need that get it off
the TRENDnet website quick installation
guide plug the things into the thing
it's that quick all right here is the TK
2o for you so this is your console this
button you press to switch between
computer one and computer two there is a
light that turns on to show you which
computer you're operating at the current
moment then you plug the keyboard and
mouse that you want to use in this case
we have some Microsoft thing and of
course our mouse plugged into the USB
cables at the front alright
speaking of people who don't know how
kvms work I'd actually don't know what
this one's for it
oh yeah the main monitor woven wire
isn't ours plugged in
oh right cuz he broke it okay right
that's so moving on so this is for the
actual monitor that you're gonna use for
both computers then you've got your
speakers as well as your microphone that
you actually use and have sitting on
your desk on the back you find two more
sets of DVI so these go out to the video
cards of each of your computers and then
you use him so here is the combo audio
DVI cable
that looks just like that so they've
used a couple extra DVI pins here for
audio so you plug that in and you go
like that
there you go and then you use these USB
cables to plug in to the USB port on the
back of your computer so by plugging
these in to your computers you got your
two computers and then you've got all
your peripherals and all of your
speakers and microphone as well as your
monitor plugged in on this side you can
effectively control both computers with
one set of peripherals so here is the
power for the KVM itself it does need
separate power not only can you switch
between the computers here but you can
also set a hot key on your keyboard to
easily switch between the two computers
now I'll explain why we kept turning you
know ranking ons like hear about his
configuration this is a DVI cable now
there's a very good reason that this KDM
has a DVI cable that is because it is
compatible not only with a digital
signal but also with an analog signal
the problem though is see those those
pins around that centerpiece okay
so we were testing a system that was
using onboard video that has a DVI D out
so that is a digital only DVI connection
so what that meant was that when slick
had our monitor plugged into the KDM and
then he had this cable going out to here
he actually physically couldn't plug it
in and that is why it is Frankensteined
right now and not hooked up correctly so
he does know when it came in this he
does know how to cook up a KDM I was
just bugging him because I'm the one on
camera and he's not allowed to say
anything so thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look an extremely
convoluted explanation of how KD M's
