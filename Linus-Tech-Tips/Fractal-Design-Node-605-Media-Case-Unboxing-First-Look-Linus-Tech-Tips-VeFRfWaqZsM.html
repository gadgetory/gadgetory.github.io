the fractal design node 6:05 computer
case it comes in an ugly box but it's
not an ugly case if it's anything like
the node 304 which we checked out
recently which was absolutely
outstanding that was an ITX case this is
a full sized ATX case however some of
the features will work better with an N
ATX board because this is sort of a
media PC optimized case I can see a lot
of people installing micro ATX boards in
it so the node 605 highlights a
minimalistic sleek Scandinavian appeal
something something something design
front panel made from eight millimeter
thick solid hair brushed and black
anodized aluminum that sounds gorgeous
front i/o an optical drive er hidden it
sets etc just go ahead and see what else
they have to say for themselves we'll
cover all this when we open it up so
don't worry too much about it and that's
pretty much it let's open this baby up
so inside we find double corrugated
cardboard Linus's packaging tips and a
hard foam not a big fan of the hard foam
but if it keeps the case staple it's not
as hard as some though so you guys you
can see there's some flex to it here see
that so it's not as stiff as some of the
hard foams that we've encountered in the
past I just pulled slicks earbuds out of
his ears that he was using to monitor
sound so why don't you bear with us and
we'll be back in just a moment
and its unveiling time one thing I
noticed right away opening it up is that
the front is the case is very front
heavy so if you were going to put this
on a media rack or something you'd want
to make sure it's got the right depth
because it would very easily OOP go like
that because most of the metal has been
punched out of the back to make room for
the dual 80 millimeter cooling fans the
IO the seven PCIe slots because you can
put a full sized ATX board in here as
well as the power supply cut out and the
front of the case has that gorgeous 8
millimeter thick aluminum holy crap this
thing is awesome look at this okay let's
pull this baby off check that out black
anodized aluminum look how thick this is
here
come around the side here you can see
how thick it is so that is what they've
decided to make the bezel load of
honestly I love this approach for things
like media pcs where you're never going
to see the top you're never going to see
the side in the back what you're going
to see is the front and if it doesn't
look good with the rest of your AV
equipment then it's gonna look stupid no
okay I think that this is very very nice
so here is something these are the kinds
of things that fractal does right when
fractal burst onto the scene with the
define r2 or but I guess the defined on
r2 the first one they did a few things
right that other guys weren't doing
here's my big problem with aluminum
front bezel cases fingerprints they
always have a little thing where you
have to press it in order to get it the
isle that's ridiculous because it just
ruins it instead fractal is implemented
a little a little notch right here so
that you can pull it down without
putting any pressure on it without
putting any fingerprints on the front
and you can get access to the front IO
so there's a slimline optical drive
which you can only use if you have an N
ATX board installed something to bear in
mind front firewire headphones
microphone USB 3 as well as an included
front card reader very good stuff
activity LED for the hard drive is
hidden but you can see it if you're
trying to diagnose something however
your power activity LED is going to be
around that illuminated power button the
original mock-up for this case had a
huge fractal logo in the middle and a
lot of reviewers and a lot of press guys
said hey go with the nice sleek little
fractal logo on the side in the corner
looks really really select this thing
looks outstanding so on this side we've
got dual 120 millimeter fan mounts looks
like this one is populated this comes
with two of there are two series fans so
those are their silent series fans
there's another 120 millimeter fan
mounted and here is the included fan
controller so that is a three channel
fan controller with three different
settings so we're going to open it up
and we'll be back in just a moment now
one of the best things you can do for
noise dampening on a case is increase
the overall the overall mass of it and
the thickness of the material so
fractals gone with a pretty thick steel
panel here and then they've added a
layer of noise dampening material to the
top now it was too
used to open this up you could replace
them with thumb screws but it doesn't
come with them by default another thing
that's going to help with noise is the
fact that you've got that huge thick
solid piece of aluminum on the front of
the case that's going to mean that no
noise is really going to pass through
here no noise is really going to pass
through here and if it comes out the
sides in the back then it's not really
the end of the world once we get into
the inside of the case you can see I've
thrown a motherboard in here just so you
guys can get some idea of how the
internal layout is going to work I'm
actually going to turn this around for
you just to show you how the how it how
it goes so you can put an ATX board in
here and then your first two expansion
slots are going to be the full 280
millimeters that this case is capable of
supporting once you start to fill up
more slots you'll have to start removing
hard drive cages if you want to get
those long expansion cards and so you
can have a long graphics cards and then
you can have smaller expansion cards
like sound cards capture cards whatever
else as you go down the motherboard you
can see there's just enough space to
plug in all your front i/o and all that
kind of stuff down here in the bottom of
the board and you can install using
their modular hard drive cage design
that they've got on the note 304
you can still up to four three and a
half inch or two and a half inch hard
drives if I turn this around you'll see
there are mounting holes here for SSD or
rubberized mounting holes for three and
a half inch drives ah the way that
they've got the the fan layout done here
is actually kind of clever so they've
got both of these fans as intakes this
one doesn't have a cover on it because
it's not so close to where your SATA
cables and everything else will be this
one has a honeycomb cover on it so these
are both intakes are going to be in
taking air from outside of you know in
front of your TV then it's going to have
positive air pressure inside the case
which will force it out the back or the
back here so what that will do is it'll
make it so that dust is far less likely
to accumulate because both of these fan
intakes are filtered and you can remove
the filters just by undoing the screws
here and here you can you can actually
see there just like a fine mesh filter
like that so no no problems there and
then the power supply obviously will
intake from this one right here and then
exhaust out the back of the power supply
so it's compatible with ITX m ATX or ATX
boards all of the interior cables
are black and sleeved and look fantastic
so we're just going to go ahead and pop
those out so there's a USB 3 your front
firewire your front audio as well as
your front panel connectors there's the
power
for that fan controller so the fan
controllers right over here and then
you've also got there you go two of them
are hooked up already
three pin connectors for the fan
controller right there overall very
solid case very very rigid and a great
value I mean what we've come to expect
from frackle let's figure your finish
off with the accessories and then I
think we're pretty much done here so if
you guys wanted to tune out now then you
could probably go ahead and do that
don't forget to subscribe and all that
good stuff
couple of brackets for power supply
probably I have no idea it's probably
manual to sector it's for the slim five
and a quarter inch base so they're not
in there because if you have a full
sized ATX board then you can't fit it
because there's sort of stuff in the way
so these go down here and allow you to
mount that comes with some cable ties as
well as all the mounting screws you'll
need for your system thank you for
