humans that call themselves your friends
and family are going to be harassing you
to go outside with them sometimes even
overnight causing entire weekends to be
wasted on not gaming there I mean don't
these people even know that you've got
raids to run noobs to pone and bags to
tea well don't worry
this summer you can have your Mountain
Dew and drink it to this summer you can
bring your games with you into the icky
wilderness and I'm not talking about
some sissy mobile gaming Nintendogs
switch boy baloney
no no I'm talking about having the
ultimate camping battle station so you
can game on my friends literally
anywhere
all right so the first thing you'll need
to take your PC gaming experience
camping is a PC we're using the infinite
a from MSI it's got a Core i7 7700 CPU
and a GTX 1080 so definitely enough to
butter up your favorite game then it has
this convenient carrying handle it's
like they knew though depending on how
much space you have in the Winnebago
with our guide you can bring pretty much
as much or as little firepower as you
want from the overkill to the small like
this msi gs70 3 vr gaming laptop
whatever your rig we can power it which
brings us to the generator if you guys
are anything like me then you will love
the prospect of powering your beast
machine with gasoline but not any old
generator will do electronics especially
your baby rely on stable power delivery
which is why we are using what's called
an inverter generator this one right
here happens to be capable of a
completely superfluous 3500 watts of
power output because that is how we do
son also that was the only one that was
available at the rental house today but
smaller inverter generators like this
one should be more than enough to get
the job done since computers generally
draw less than 500 watts even wild
gaming as for fuel our 8 liter generator
burned about point 4 liters per hour
during our tests so for an entire
weekend of 12 hour gaming sessions we'd
recommend bringing along 15 liters of
gas or about four gallons oh and don't
forget to bring along an extension cord
so your teammates don't have to listen
to the drone of the generator on
teamspeak as well as a power bar to plug
everything in and if you're super
hardcore a UPS so even if you run out of
gas you can still finish up the round
beef
we're running over there to top up there
is literally no need to shutdown ever
now what we've got so far would be
enough whether you're out in the woods
for a land party with friends or your
friends totally suck and you'd rather
game solo if it weren't for pesky online
activation these days even many
single-player games require an always-on
internet connection and let's face it
you guys are dying to tap into the kind
of primal base instincts that only
wrecking chumps from an open cliff face
can evoke so let's get online we're
using a wireless hotspot from tellus
that we loaded up with four gigs of data
enough to get us through an entire long
weekend's worth of 12-hour gaming
sessions every day since most modern
games only use about a hundred megabytes
of data per hour just be sure to get any
games including updates and downloadable
content before you leave the safety of
your Ethernet cables embrace and don't
canoe into the wild just yet you may
have learned enough to build a camping
battle station by this point but is it
school keep observing young grasshopper
with this personal canopy system you can
maintain your healthy Casper like glow
and with our very affordable monitor
hood you can throw shade on your screen
and all the haters then for 100%
completion add a tiny fan that no one
but you is allowed to use oh and don't
forget to bring a towel to wipe the
sweat and bugle crumbs off your fingers
in between spawns which brings us quite
gracefully actually to the food
situation most beverages at the campsite
are going to be chilled with ice in a
cooler which means you're gonna have to
get up to get one and your hands will
get cold
what every time you reach for your drink
if you're a sucker our drinks are gonna
be on hand and as dry as a can of
hydration can be good night aren't you
gonna have to leave a disk get food
anyway
not this time idiot we brought our
telescopic three meter long live
streaming a weenie roaster
I am never socializing again but how to
keep the other humans from coming over
to me to ruin my fun got you covered
party poopers can't bork what they can't
see
whoa where'd it go plus we brought a
second line of defense literally these
$10 sound grenades scream at a hundred
and thirty decibels
perfect for repelling bears robbers or
people who care about you but if they're
anywhere near as persistent as mine at
least you've got your rig you've got
your power you've got your data and of
course you're camping necessities
everything you need to go totally feral
you don't even need to pack the urine
and if you really want to get in the
game by the way we recommend the Far Cry
series roar so thanks for watching guys
and a huge thank you to MSI for
sponsoring this fun little video with
their infinite a gaming system and with
their super thin and light gaming
laptops porting nvidia geforce gtx 1070
graphics with max q design you can check
those out at the link in the video
description and while they're down there

where we have cool shirts like not the
one that I'm wearing as well as a link
