least depending how you divide them up
six distinct segments with a total of
nearly three dozen processors ranging
all the way from under 50 bucks to
around 1,700 US dollars and while this
is admittedly a huge improvement over
the last generation 4000 series which
had twice as many in the desktop range
and over 250 total it's still super
confusing so I fired up arc Intel's
handy dandy product database extracted
the most pertinent information and put
it in a spreadsheet that you can
download below that should make choosing
the right CPU much much easier and give
me a kickback if you buy using the
included Amazon links
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description TL DR if you're
building on the cheap a pentium g 4400
dual-core at around 60 bucks is your
best bet because if you were willing to
spend $92 for the g 45 20s marginal
speed improvement the core i3 6100 is
worth the extra 25 more thanks to its
higher clock speed and hyper threading
from there if you're a heavier
multitasker or a light content creator
the whole non T Core i5 lineup makes a
fair amount of sense with the core i5
6500 coming in strongest in my mind
thanks to its 19% base clock advantage
over the 6,400 for only a 10% price
premium if I was going to spring for an
i5 6600 personally I'd pay the extra 20
or so for the K variant it's got a
higher TDP that means more power
consumption but with an extra investment
in a z-series motherboard it supports
overclocking which can either give you a
bit of extra near the end of your
computer's usable lifespan or improve
resale value when the time comes to sell
it and start from scratch this is
basically as high as I'd go for a pure
gaming machine for aspiring content
creators let's say gamers who also
stream or edit together their gameplays
for later upload to youtube the core i7
6700 K takes everything that's good
about the 6600 K and adds
hyper-threading more cache and the
highest base and boost clocks across
Intel's entire current generation lineup
and you can find links to all of these
processors in the video description okay
so the TL DR is over kids let's see how
we got there I'm going to start with the
easy way weed out products that have
zero customer reviews a given SKU can
have more reviews for a number of
reasons
sometimes it's because the people who
buy them have invested very heavily and
feel compelled to show from the treetops
especially to each other about how
justified they were in doing so though
the psychology of consumer behavior is
far beyond the scope of this video but
the most common reason is that someone
else out there has already done the
grunt work research to determine that
for example
the core i3 6100 at a hundred and
seventeen dollars makes more sense than
the i3 6300 at a hundred and
thirty-eight dollars with it's barely
higher clock speed extra one Meg of cash
and marginally faster onboard graphics
there are exceptions to this but some
solid indicators aside from reviews are
adequate stock and properly filled out
product information pages and photos not
to mention the availability of a box
version directly from Intel though for a
specialty let's say a super low power
consumption build you might not be able
to avoid non box that is to say tray or
OAM parts the core i5 6400 tea from the
tea low power series is a standout here
as a 35 watt true quad core at 2.2 to
2.8 gigahertz for 170 bucks though we
can see that the comparison here is
somewhat unfair because real-world
pricing on similar chips like the 6500 T
is way off of Intel suggested price on
arc this is pretty normal on these niche
skews though and yet another reason to
gravitate towards the higher volume
chips that every retailer and their dog
is competing hard to sell so that they
not only sell the CPU but also all the
other accessories that go with it
in fact for these high-volume items it's
not uncommon to see them going for even
less than Intel's MSRP on sale now let's
go deeper you've probably noticed Xeon
processors sprinkled in with the core
branded consumer ones
I included those in my spreadsheet for
the sake of completeness but in a
nutshell Zeon's at the same specs in the
same socket perform identically to
desktop chips and differ from consumer
CPUs primarily in their ability to use
ECC error correcting memory which you
can learn more about here most 1000
series eons can even actually run
unofficially though in the same consumer
LGA 1151 motherboards as everything else
that I've talked about so far so if you
find one you like you can do that though
please note that ECC memory support
depends on the motherboard chipset - so
you'd lose some of the benefit that
you're usually paying extra for in that
case moving up higher than the 6700 K
means we're getting into two different
territories here both of which require
moving up to the big boy pants socket
LGA 2011 three prosumer and professional
use we're dramatically reducing project
times with more processing cores will
improve productivity and therefore
profit or because I can land where often
knowing what they're doing enthusiasts
consumers will drop obscene amounts of
money knowing that they aren't getting a
good value let's try to cover both of
them all 2011 three processors require a
50 to $100 more expensive motherboard
but they support more PCI Express Lanes
and quad channel vs. dual channel memory
though this is a dubious value to the
typical gamer with core branded products
and 1000 series xeon eps limited to one
cpu on a motherboard 2000 series xeon
eps bumping that up to two CPUs on a
motherboard and e^x Class C on is
capable of running four CPUs on a single
motherboard though you'll pay a
significant premium for that feature in
the core range the i7 6800 K stands out
to me
it comes with 28 PCIe lanes so two-way
SLI the highest we recommend is all good
you get 94% of the clock speed at 73% of
the price
compared to the 68 50k which also boasts
40 PCIe lanes if you're in expansion
fiend and like the rest of the h EDT or
high-end desktop core i7s it supports
overclocking meaning that the clock and
architectural disadvantage versus the
6700 K that comes with being based on
the slower updated server workstation
platform are a little more palatable
given the reasonable hundred dollar
premium for 50% more processing cores
it's got six of them the rest of the
2011 three core i7s seem to be priced
more like high clock speed high power
consumption Xeon skews the 68 50k and
the 69 hundred K hold their own pretty
well against the very similar a 5 1650
and e5 1660 if you want to trade ECC
support for overclocking but as for the
10 core 69 50 X Extreme Edition while it
enjoys a significant max turbo boost
clock speed advantage over the entire
Xeon range with a couple exceptions
including this weird quad core that I
wouldn't recommend over a lower-priced
LGA 1151 model it doesn't make as much
sense to me as the similarly priced be 5
2680 v4 I mean if you need 10 cores
wouldn't you also benefit from 14 and
probably ECC because that's the basic
process for choosing a Xeon in theory
clock speed times the physical cores and
total logical cores provided by hyper
threading technology you can learn more
about here where applicable for
multi-threaded workloads like CPU based
video encoding or 3d modeling and
scientific number crunching will give
you total performance sort of and you'll
need to weigh that then against your
sensitivity to high power consumption
and high price though again it isn't
quite that simple the base clock is not
necessarily representative of the speed
at which the chip will actually operate
and neither is the boost for that matter
this handy chart that I found for
current generations Eon
EP processors reveals that in heavy AVX
loads the 14 core 2690 v4 costs 20% more
than a 14 core 2680 v4 and appears to
enjoy a 10% clock speed advantage but in
actuality only runs 7% faster with up to
6 cores boosted and only three and a
half percent faster with all 14
furthermore for workstation use
virtualization that technology that
allowed me to have 10 gamers running off
of a single computer here or bursty a
single threaded application use games
love high performance course high boost
clocks can be as important as many cores
if not more so as our comparison between
the 6700 K quad core which costs 350
bucks and the 69 50 x10 core which cost
1700 demonstrated with the 6700 K being
a clearly superior gaming chip due to
its higher peak clock speed
I'll have that chart linked below as
well which leads us to two more things I
haven't touched on some specialized
features like trusted execution
technology if you need that your
decision is pretty simple buy one of the
few SKUs that supports it and finally it
almost never makes sense to buy a last
generation CPU brand new clearance deals
do happen but they're rare because Intel
usually carefully manages supply in
their distribution channels so basically
nothing is left by the time the new ones
start hitting shelves usually at the
same price for something slightly better
than the old one second hand chips on
the other hand can be a steal I'd take
this aging 6 core for 200 bucks at the
time of writing and overclock the
stuffing out of it over our current
generation quad for certain workloads
but watch out CPUs especially older ones
generally outlast their motherboards by
a considerable margin so finding a
compatible board at all let alone one at
a reasonable price with a somewhat
up-to-date feature set can make this
approach less feasible so then
have you made it this far and still feel
lost I'll have some references I talked
about some of them linked in the video
description but worst case scenario join
the Linus tech tips comm forum and ask
for help our community is awesome and
someone would be happy to help you find
the right CPU for your new machine so
