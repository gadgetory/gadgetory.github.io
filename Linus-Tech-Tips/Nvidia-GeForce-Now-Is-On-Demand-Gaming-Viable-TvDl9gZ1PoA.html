be done
they said the latency would be too high
they said will always game on our own
local hardware they were what in the
world could that be the master case five
by cooler master gives you the freedom
to truly make your mid tower PC case
your own with a variety of modular parts
and accessories check out the link in
the video description to learn more
alright so as I alluded to in my
entirely spoiler free aka completely
useless intro the subject of today's
video is g-force now nvidia z' new
products that could be described as a
way to play games over the internet
which no actually that's not going to
work it's because it's not multiplayer
gaming we've had that for decades so
let's call it something else let's call
it game streaming which yeah I know that
sounds an awful lot like what they do on
twitch TV alright fine I will use the C
word cloud GeForce now is a cloud-based
gaming service that uses invidious grid
technology in one of their data centers
in North America Europe and a pack to
take input from your keyboard and mouse
or controller send it to an instance of
your game running on a virtual machine
render out the game frames at 30 or 60
FPS per second depending on the title
compress them on the fly and beam them
to your supported device over the
Internet
with the objective being to do this at a
reasonable price while delivering the
utmost and image quality and with little
enough latency that is the delay between
pressing a button and seeing an action
on screen that it doesn't feel like
trying to op in Counter Strike by
yelling at your neighbor to move the
mouse and press buttons for you so let's
address the first point first is the
price reasonable at $7.99 Nvidia is
clearly borrowing an established price
point in the streamed content industry
so the real question becomes one of
whether they are delivering enough value
for that price point compared to a
service like Netflix here I have a few
criticisms game variety ads can be
expected of a new service
is okay for casual users but a bit of a
low point if you're a pretty avid gamer
that wants to make this service your
go-to when you pick up a controller and
settle down on the couch while there are
a couple of exceptions the list of games
included with your membership fee is
mostly a metric but ton of Lego games
and older triple-a titles like the
Batman series and Walking Dead Season 1
with newer games like Witcher 3
requiring an add-on purchase in order to
be streamed that means I actually had to
buy Metro last light at full steam
retail price for my performance testing
more on that later even though I own
that game on Steam already the good news
is that if you're playing new games
versus ones that you already own most
game purchases on GeForce now come with
a steam or GOG key that you can activate
on those services for local play if you
want but there are still two issues here
one it would be nice if I could bind my
Steam account to my GeForce now account
and be allowed to use the service to
stream titles I already own and two this
one is a much bigger deal IMO I
shouldn't be paying full sticker price
for games on a service where I not only
have to pay monthly to be a member but I
also have to buy a specialized piece of
streaming hardware from Nvidia a shield
portable tablet or Android TV for a
couple hundred bucks in the first place
let's move on to objective number two
image quality here Nvidia gets full
marks and this isn't anything surprising
to me since I've been such a huge fan of
game stream since at launch but I
haven't even considered a non Nvidia
graphics card for my personal rig in
over two years but the power of Nvidia
grid on the other side means running
games at 60fps steady at 1080p is a
non-issue and NVIDIA is real-time h.264
encoding continues to deliver good
enough image quality that on a handheld
device or from the couch you will be
hard-pressed to find any issues with it
aside from the same blockiness or color
banding that you'll find in low contrast
scenes in pretty much any internet
streamed content which ties in pretty
nicely with performance game launch
times were nice
snappy especially after the first time
you launch them and as long as my
internet connection was stable I noticed
very few hitches or hiccups in the game
animation but while you might be
pleasantly surprised to see the same
graphics quality menus that you would
find if you were running the game
locally including anti-aliasing sliders
improved texture quality etc turning any
of these dials past default will result
in stuttery playback and the default
suggested settings will reapply every
time you launch a game this is pretty
disappointing but the good news is that
these settings are still going to spank
what you'll get out of a modern
generation console and there's
definitely room then for Nvidia to add
more power per user as time goes on
which is fine and good Linus but I've
been watching this video for five
minutes and none of us were worried that
a building full of GTX Titans couldn't
run toybox turbos what about the latency
yes the Achilles heel of gaming over the
Internet whether we're talking about
some jackass on dial-up teleporting all
over the place or in this case the
actual delay between executing a command
on your controller and seeing the
results on screen too much of which can
result in a visually pleasing but
downright unplayable gaming experience
since you could end up turning left when
you mean to turn right and vice-versa so
for my testing methodology I chose Metro
last light because it's available on all
the platforms I wanted to test it
delivered consistent results and it only
takes about two minutes to get from the
very beginning of the game menu to a
point where you can actually fire a gun
a necessary component of my testing in
the opening attack sequence I used a Ben
qrl 2460 monitor with a makeymakey
hanging in front of it
I would execute five left mouse clicks
which illuminates an LED on the PCB of
the makeymakey nearly instantaneously
then using a high-speed camera in this
case the 240 FPS slow-motion recording
mode on the iPhone 6s I can measure how
many frames there are between the LED
flashing and the muzzle flashes from the
gun with each frame
representing about four milliseconds
some of these results are not surprising
at all gaming on a local machine is much
more responsive and experience then
encoding frames beaming them somewhere
and decoding them on the other side so
if you're a super competitive gamer who
is concerned about the couple of
milliseconds of latency that a wireless
mouse adds none of this is going to
matter to you run your games directly on
your PC but it wasn't as bad as I
thought it might be and if local games
dream was already good enough for you
then GeForce now probably isn't going to
break the experience for you since it
added the 25 milliseconds reported by
the network analysis tool about a frame
and 2/3 on our office Internet
connection with that said I don't know
how much I can trust that tool right now
my office connection a business grade
gigabit symmetric dedicated fiber line
with a service level agreement and my
residential connection a 100 down 5 up
DOCSIS 3.0 affair tested almost
identically using the built in tool the
actual performance though of the fiber
connection crushed my home cable
connection like to the point where I
could definitely recommend GeForce now
if you're on fiber or located a little
closer to one of the data centers then I
am here in southwest Canada but could
not for any but the most casual gamers
at 1/5 of a second of delay probably
closer to 1/4 of a second if you're on a
TV with data caps being yet another
consideration giving you're looking at
similar bit rates to Netflix but you're
more likely to game for 6.3 hours in a
day than watch a movie for that long
that is to say unless you've already got
your tickets for the force awakens and
you feel the need to binge watch all the
previous Star Wars movies to prepare
