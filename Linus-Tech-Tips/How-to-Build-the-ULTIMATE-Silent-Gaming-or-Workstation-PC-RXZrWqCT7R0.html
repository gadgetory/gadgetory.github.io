can't shake the lights I'll take the
chat and/or the guys I
and just for them
this
today's PC build guide theme is one that
I've wanted to do for quiet some time
and when we've all heard the arguments
against silent computing law it doesn't
matter if your PC's loud just put on
your headphones it to me that's about
like saying it doesn't matter if your
armpits stink just wear a nose plug no
I'm not going to wear protective ear
coverings to use my computer that's
ridiculous especially given that modern
hardware if configured correctly can
achieve near silence without
compromising performance and that is
what we're going to show you today
welcome to the near silent gaming PC
build guide start by preparing your
workspace a safe uncluttered static-free
workstation is a must I use a mod nut
and an anti-static ankle strap now the
only tool we really need for assembly is
a multi-bit screwdriver but a magnetic
parts tray a pair of side cutters and a
pair of needle nose pliers are all nice
to have now before you actually start
putting a stuff into the case I
recommend verifying that the system
posts or powers on and outputs to the
display you can use your motherboard box
as a free non conductive test bench our
CPU choice was all about pushing the
limits of silent computing and the core
i7 59 60 x8 core extreme edition
processor from Intel is the best of the
best of any enthusiast grade chip
available today you could substitute it
for a 5820k or a 59 30 K hex core
processor if you don't need the extra 2
cores but I wanted to validate this
build concept with the hungriest version
of haswell-e that we could get and this
is it hold your cpu by the edges and
identify the corner with the gold
triangle align that with the corner of
the motherboard socket that has a
triangle as well lift up the first
retention arm on this side then the
second one on the other side lift up the
socket cover place the CPU in with no
force lower the cover
and fastened both pretension arms in
reverse order
while water coolers can be quiet and I
normally use them for these guides for a
computer to be truly silent it needs to
eliminate as many moving parts as
possible and all high performance CPU
water coolers will have at least three
of them a motor in the pump and two more
motors one in each fan so I went instead
with a massive be quiet dark Rock pro 3
and removed its cooling fans outright
for a total of 0 moving parts screw the
four posts that look like this into the
four little sockets around the CPU apply
a thicker than normal line of thermal
compound to the processor there's a big
die underneath there then put the
heatsink down with the brand logo
sideways for a slightly better cooling
or right-side up if you've got a touch
of the OCD like I do using the included
wrench or a pair of needle nose pliers
tighten down these four nuts onto each
of the posts until it is secure our ram
choice was just about made for us the
cpu supports quad channel ddr4 so we
knew we'd need a kit of that and thanks
to clearance challenges with the fins of
our heat sinks we scrapped the original
plan and using 32 gigs of Dominator
platinum 26 66 megahertz ram and went
with 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance LP X
memory at 2400 megahertz
pull back the tabs on the four grey Ram
slots then starting with the innermost
on each side position each dim so the
notch and the bottom lines up with the
notch in the socket then press firmly on
both ends until the tabs snap back into
place on their own there are actually a
few great choices out there when it
comes to quiet cases but I went with the
be quiet silent bass 800 for a couple of
reasons one when I was planning this
video it was definitely the newest and
most exciting silent case on the market
with included noise dampening material
high quality included fans and a solid
internal layout and too even though now
it has some competition for that other
title it's definitely
the only one available in this awesome
black and orange color scheme that feels
very Linus tech tipsy so put both side
panels in the box where they'll be safe
and use your magnetic tray if you have
one to keep all the included screws in
one place
take off the rear 120 millimeter fan and
replace it with a 1500 RPM silent wings
to blowing into the case with the fan
lead coming out this corner use the anti
vibration corner pieces with the
pushpins and washers to secure that in
place using the same fan mounting system
install another silent wings to fan in
the top this time the 1000 rpm 140
millimeter variety simply pull the top
bezel off using the three tabs on either
side I recommend starting at the back
and moving forward then stab that fan
and pop the bezel back into place we
won't have any hard drives in our system
due to noise concerns so for better air
flow we're going to remove all the three
and a half inch drive cages by pulling
out the thumb screws on the right and
left and sliding them out also watch out
for those screws that go into those long
standoffs at the back keep these cages
somewhere safe though so you'll have the
option to put one or both back in the
future now arguably we could have chosen
any motherboard on Asus x99 lineup for
this build says they're all passively
cooled and therefore silent but I went
with the ws board because the quality
and efficiency of the components is
second to none which is very important
if you plan from the start to not cool
your system properly I mean most
motherboards even if they don't have any
fans of their own will be designed with
the expectation that there will be some
airflow provided by the system fans or
the CPU fan but we won't really have any
unless the going gets tough oh and yeah
did I also mention that it looks amazing
even when there's no side panel window
I'm a bit of a sucker for beautiful
motherboards so there you go press
firmly on the four corners of the i/o
shield until they snap into place if you
want to save yourself some trouble for
later
grab the 24 pin and eight pin
motherboard connector from your power
supply box plug them into your board
light
so then feed them through these holes
place the board down on the integrated
standoffs and install the screws that
look like this into the eight positions
around the perimeter of the board the
middle one can be left blank this is
just a post to hold the board in place
while you secure it while you have easy
access to the board plug in the front
power and reset switches as well as the
power and drive activity LEDs follow up
with the block style connectors for USB
to front audio and USB 3.0 then finally
connect all of your fans with inline low
noise adaptors we use knock to a ones
but anything will work our top fan will
use the connector at the very top right
our rear fan will use the CPU connector
and our front fence will use the one
that's middle of the board on the
right-hand edge and the one that's at
the bottom right I struggled a lot with
the power supply choice for this rig a
lot the main options are always on
active cooling load or temperature
activated fan cooling with a silent mode
and fully passive as it is I settled on
a fully passive see sonic 520 FL squared
because it's fully modular allowing us
to keep unnecessary wires out of the way
of what little airflow we have in our
system and because a single GTX 980 and
59 60 X is well within its comfort zone
if you decided to add a second graphics
card to your build though you may want
to consider going with a hybrid fan
model so you keep that silence when the
system is idling and the fan only kicks
in when the power supply is working hard
slide the power supply in grille side up
for better cooling and attach it to the
case using four of these screws you
already ran the eight pin and 24-pin
power connectors so just plug those into
the modular interface on the power
supply if you have SATA drives in your
system you can attach the wire harnesses
for those now and then finally plug in
the PCI Express power connectors that we
need for the graphics card and route
them through this cable management hole
our SSD choice was one that
honestly I made to make our PC more Mac
Pro like I mean SATA drives are still
fine and you can mount them to the back
of the motherboard train but we figured
hey we're dead quiet already we might as
well have lightning-fast PCI Express
based storage while we're at it with no
clutter due to SATA data or power cables
this is the muskan scorpion a PCI
Express 2.0 tunic's expansion card that
boasts an onboard RAID controller to san
force driven 480 gig SSDs a
hundred-thousand 4k random right eye ops
and sequential read and write speeds
just shy of one gigabyte per second oh
and all this comes in at a price that's
less than a dollar per gig it's also
brain-dead simple to install find a PCI
Express slot that you don't need for the
graphics card later take the thumb screw
and slot cover off align the card
carefully with the PCIe slot below
remember guys a 1x card can go on a 1 X
4 X 8 X or 16x slot
press firmly down on the card and put
the thumb screw back in the GPU for this
build guide since it's more of a how-to
by a silent yet extremely powerful PC
rather than being strictly about gaming
type of video is kind of up to you but I
chose a single GTX 980 Strix from a soos
because it features a fanless mode when
running 2d applications at the desktop
and the fan only kicks in when the
graphics card is working hard just like
the case fans that are plugged into the
motherboard with an alternative graphics
card you can still build a very quiet
computer but if the goal is near silence
at idle a hybrid fanless card like the
strict series is the way to go to
install our cards simply remove the two
thumb screws holding in these two PCI
covers we're using this 16x slot to give
our CPU and video card a little bit of
breathing room and the power supply to
then align the card carefully with the
slot push down firmly put the two thumb
screws back in and plug in the PCI
Express 6 pin and eight pin power
connectors that we cable managed earlier
which leads nice
into cable management and finishing
touches at the back you can see we've
run so few cables for this system that
it's almost laughable how little there
is to clean up back here
just use the zip ties included with the
case and the power supply to route the
front fan connectors up so we can't see
them bundle together the motherboard
connectors behind the tray don't worry
about making them perfect there's tons
of room for cable management back here
in this case and then our cherry on top
is a silverstone magnetic fan filter to
put over that rear fan that we're using
as an intake maintaining positive air
pressure with only filtered intakes will
keep our system nice and clean for a
long time with minimal maintenance
required now sometimes we include
monitor and peripheral recommendations
but because there isn't really a
straight up intended purpose for this
machine all I can really do is point you
in the direction of some solid premium
stuff we've checked out recently
LG's 34 UC 97 curved 34 inch monitor is
great for productivity and a Seuss's rog
swift g-sync monitor is great for gaming
and to match the black and orange theme
some RGB peripherals like a k70 RGB
keyboard and saber optical RGB mouse
would do just nicely our Scorpion PCIe
SSD comes pre-configured in raid zero so
you can skip the menu to change its
settings that you would access with
control-m during boot and just press
Delete or f2 to get into the UEFI bios
for the x79 EWS motherboard once we're
in here everything we need for this
system is in easy mode fan rpm
monitoring boot priority configuration
and XMP configuration which we need to
change to profile one to ensure our ram
is running at the right speed is all
we're pretty much going to do we won't
be doing any overclocking on this system
because of all the cooling fans that
we've removed for silence to install
your Windows operating system create a
bootable USB Drive and then reboot the
system while mashing f8 immediately to
get to the boot device selection menu
where you'll pick your USB Drive once
the setup process has begun it's
basically a matter of clicking next
until you land on the Windows desktop
once there drivers can be found on the
Asus website and video web
site and Intel website for everything in
this system now well I don't normally
install a Seuss's AI suite software
utility you're going to want to download
that and install at least fan expert for
the next step and now it's time to take
our system from very quiet to near
silent we'll be using a Seuss's fan
expert software to create custom fan
curves and we'll be using their Auto fan
stop feature to turn all the system fans
except the CPU fan completely off when
our CPU temperature is low enough and
then we'll ramp the other fan speeds up
slowly once the system is under load and
starts to heat up the other piece of
software we need is msi afterburner our
video cards fans already turn off when
the system is idling but we can fine
tune things quite a bit with a custom
fan curve in here I'm also going to
tweak the temperature limit to 85
degrees so the card won't thermal
throttle as aggressively as if we left
it at the default setting now the exact
positions for all the dials in these
applications that are right for you will
depend on the ambient temperature and
your personal comfort zone with respect
to temperatures but with some fiddling
and load-testing with the software that
you typically use this config can be set
up to be not only silent at idle but
very very quiet even under gaming load
but of course don't take our word for it
we're on our way to the SPC our testing
lab to validate how quiet our system
really is so it's field trip time we're
here with silent mic from silent PC
review and we're inside his homemade
sound chamber but first Mike tell us
about silent PC review how long you've
been doing this what's the objective
well silent PC review is 12 years old
now and we've been focused entirely on
the noise aspects of computers for all
this time so what we do is we're looking
for the quietest gear and showing people
how to make the quietest computers
all right but you need some pretty
specialized equipment in order to even
validate how quiet something is tell me
about this room that you built well this
is this is what it's all about is this
room is all about super low noise it was
built in about a month using pretty much
homemade tools and it's got 600 pounds
of what is called blue fill which is a
fiberglass substitute and that lines the
entire interior of the room and that
gives us a total sound level of 11
decibels a weighted most times during
the day if you wait till about two
o'clock in the morning might get down to
about nine point five or ten but nobody
wants to be up that late doing this
stuff so obviously it's not enough just
to build a special room you have to have
some kind of methodology for testing
this stuff right like how do you do it
well first of all you need to measure at
the standard distance which is one meter
okay and you need a microphone that's
quiet enough so that it's quieter than
the equipment you're trying to measure
right our microphone is seven decibels a
weighted that's about as quiet as you
can get in a microphone it's connected
up to a sound card and a computer on the
outside which is able to take the signal
without adding any more noise of its own
and then give me a calibrated decibel
reading and it's a weighted a weighted
means that it's tailored to the to match
the sound of your human hearing all
right Mike give it to me straight
how did I do well at idle it's pretty
damn good
all right 14 decibels at idle is about
as good as you can get we have one
machine that does better but you know
it's not one of these right by that is
that it's not a 400 watt Beast right but
at 24 it's a little higher than what we
would expect in a you know at maximum
low that's a little higher than our
standard which is 20 decibels for silent
but our general definition is that it is
under 27 decibels it's pretty quiet so
there you go so guys we didn't quite get
the s
PCR seal of approval but if you guys
want to learn more where do they where
do they find out how to build a 20
decibel or less gaming machine see
review.com that's where you come to all
right so there you go guys thank you so
much for watching our our ultimate I
guess I have to call it ultimate very
quiet PC build guide now that I've got
the real skinny on how well we did guys
I guess you can enjoy some glam of our
finished system here and as always huge
thank you to the entire crew involved
big thank you to Intel for sponsoring
this PC build guide and we'll see you
guys again next time make sure you're
subscribed and all that good stuff
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
