that's actually pretty cool
this is the zotac z box 8004 plus so
it's got their usual chassis but there's
some aspects of this particular little
mini PC that are not very usual at all
it comes with bluetooth Gigabit LAN
802.11 n so that is an wireless a remote
control and a vase amount the
configuration that I've got here has a
320 GB hard drive in 2 gigs of memory
although you can buy it as a bare-bones
which doesn't come with a hard driver
ram obviously at a cheaper price and you
can put in whatever you want so you can
build yourself a very silent very high
performance and more on that later mini
PC for a very reasonable budget
it also doesn't come with an operating
system so you're free to choose your own
whether you want to go with you know 7
home premium professional or whatever
else the case may be they don't lock you
in that way or force you to buy a more
expensive premium SKU in order to get a
better operating system so that's
something that's really convenient let's
have a look at the overall specs first
so this uses the AMD 450 apu which has
two cores running at one point 6 5
gigahertz as well as an AMD 6000 series
60 320 graphics core built into the apu
itself so an APU is kind of like a CPU
and a GPU on one die moving on we've got
2 2 gigs of memory included there are
two sodium's swap slots available it
supports one two and a half inch hard
drive or SSD with the 320 gig drive
included anything without plus and the
part number is a bear but just so you
guys know Gigabit LAN 802.11 n bluetooth
3.0 it has an SDHC slot that also
supports memory stick if you actually
still use that onboard a channel digital
audio is output via HDMI or optical spit
if okay io dimensions we'll get into
that later cool there's a QR code will
stop talk about that after and since
we're gonna open this thing none of this
is very relevant so let's get this baby
opened up I don't know if you guys
remember but I did a full NCIX tech tips
episode on one of
attacks mini pcs which was just beastly
the thing was running some serious -
trade em cavies using XBMC very very
robust little system buncha pieces here
you know what I'm gonna actually open
these up off-camera so here we are one
thing that we do have to do is install
the batteries in the remote which is a
fairly simple process as you guys can
see Here I am doing it now I'm doing it
I'm doing it now you know the guys on
the local radio station team 10:40 the
the sports radio station are just
they're doing like this thing it's like
a March Madness theme like a basketball
theme thing where they're taking iconic
TV characters and then they have like
brackets where they come down down down
to a Finals and then they're gonna have
someone win and they're having the B
listeners vote and they are like floored
every time Basil Fawlty wins a bracket
because apparently none of them
understand the humor of Fawlty Towers
which just perked me this morning
because they were like good some Brutus
show the rulli 12 episode yes 12
episodes of the purest comedy gold that
ever existed anyway moving on here is
the media center remote that is included
it has all of your usual suspects in
terms of programmable keys numbers and
mute buttons and navigation keys and all
that good stuff next we have the
included power cord for included screws
more on those later as well as the IR
receiver so the reason this comes on a
really low in court that it's more than
one line is arm span in length is
because it can be easily positioned like
plugged into the the D box itself and in
position somewhere discreet and
convenient so that the remote will be
able to hit it and hit that thing okay
then we have an antenna and a little
mounting piece here which will do more
on later as well as a warranty terms
thing so in the look at that in the EU
they get two years I think that's my law
everywhere else is one year driver
installation DVD user's manual as well
as Quick Start Guide now the unit itself
so remember guys this is an e 450 that
means it is capable of DirectX 11 gaming
and
like dirt3 for example where they're not
super super demanding but they are
DirectX 11 so more on that in a moment
here let's sigh let's do the unity very
shiny ERP ready evidently there's our
cooling fan right there can you guys see
that at all there's a little aluminum
heatsink under it I don't know if you're
gonna be able to see that that's okay
there's a cooling fan in there you guys
have to take my word for it we also have
four rubber feet so if you want to use
it sitting down you would put it this
way and as like a media PC box that's
probably how I would set it up you can
decide which way is the front so there's
an exhaust vent here with that front USB
2 on this side there's audio so that's
headphones microphone SD slot USB 2
wireless LAN indicator drive indicator
power button ok so that's probably the
front then moving on to this side we got
a couple screws so that's to open up the
chassis as well as more ventilation
holes and finally on this side this is
what I'd consider to be the back yeah
yeah this is the back so there's the
wireless antenna which we can derp plug
in if I can oh it's like spring-loaded
okay there you go Marlys antenna USB 3
Gigabit Ethernet 2 more USB 2
DisplayPort oh that's cool that's that's
a function of the AMD Radeon graphics
onboard HDMI as well as optical audio
out and finally the power in it also has
a power indicator on the top that orange
ring does glow but check this out this
is the kind of thing ZOTAC thought of
you can turn it off in the BIOS if you
have it in a room where for example
maybe it's a media PC and you don't want
like disturbing random orange blows
coming out of your PC turn it off no
problem and then it just looks the way
it does when it's powered off right now
other than a small glow from the power
button yeah that is USB - sorry I was
just checking that guys so ok great what
other options do we have for mounting so
you guys saw this funky thing right here
that is so that you
so that you can mount it on the base
station which hopefully I can figure out
how to do there we go yeah slide that
into place that is another way that you
can configure it finally and it comes
with everything you need in the box you
can do it this way check this out
it comes with a base amount so all you
have to do is clip the unit in and I'll
see if I can remember have it yeah there
we go you can find the guides here so
you see these indents right here and
then right here you just click the unit
in like this and you mount the plastic
piece hold on that opens up the clips so
you mount the plastic piece to the back
of your TV or monitor or maybe you're
using this at a POS terminal and a store
something where you you don't want like
a huge PC next to it you screw this into
the back with those screws but I said I
tell you more about later they're stuck
to something sorry guys and then you
clip the PC in just like this like I've
kind of showed you already but whatever
and there you go
just like that no big deal right you
have access to all of your important i/o
including that top USB 2 port and you
have a nice little low-profile PC you
don't need a wire for a networking
because it has built-in Wireless as well
as built-in Bluetooth and I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
