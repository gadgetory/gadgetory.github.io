I've got almost everything torn out
although I am actually going to take the
case apart all the way all the way down
to the drive cages here the mid plate
these back pieces I don't know if you
guys have ever noticed this before but
when I originally got the internals of
my case powder-coated you can see here
this is a mountain mods black wrinkled
finish when I originally got that done I
forgot to send Ben from mountain mods
this piece this piece and this one so
they've always still been the original
silver aluminum color so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to try and find a
local shop with a chemical bath strip
down the powder coating off of my old
parts including my motherboard tray here
as well and then I'm going to send him
all the old parts stripped down the
parts that have never been done I'm
gonna strip the powder the factory
powder coating off these mtech 900 drive
cages and I'll send those down as well
so that they will at least if they don't
match this finish they'll at least match
the interior finish because otherwise I
don't really know what else to do with
that you can see there's a lot of gunk
in here that I'm going to have to clean
off before I can even get the paint
stripped off these are this is residue
left behind from the cathode lights
mounting so there's some up here as well
I don't know if you guys can see that
ooh something up there whoops I forgot
about those ah there you go now you can
see it so there's lots of tapes and junk
that's gonna take me a while to clean
out get these fans out of here I think
I'm going to stick with the gelid wings
I like them for a couple reasons they
undervolt really well plus the blades
come right off so it means you can clean
them out really easily and then just pop
them back in there so that's awesome
plus it's one of the few high quality
fans that comes in 120 mil 92 mil and
whatever other sizes you need I'm going
to stick with err penetrators for the
radiator in the bottom as well I don't
see the point of spending money on fans
if I already have good high-quality ones
that I can just clean up now reservoir
this is something that's a bit tricky
this is my this is my most current one
so this is my problem with the MC res
micro it always Gunks up because no loop
is 100% clean and that too you know
lesser or greater extent this one's epic
so that's pretty yeah yeah it's pretty
pretty disgusting and it's impossible to
clean um
so I'm either gonna go with a fresh MC
res micro so here's a new one this is a
red 2 so it's got the the fill port in
the bottom I think yeah so it has the
fill port in the bottom all those are
red ones so I'm either going to do that
or I'm gonna go with the XS PC acrylic
tank reservoir for the Lang d5 because I
don't have a ton of space in the
basement down here once I put in that
thick 480 millimeter radiator and the
power supply I'm left with just a tiny
bit of space here for cable routing and
and for the pump in reservoir so I might
go that route remember the fittings for
the radiator come out over here as well
so it's very cramped in there
and since tidying up the cabling is one
of the goals for this build I'm going to
have to figure out a smarter way to do
that so the reservoir top goes on
instead of this piece right here you
just screw the pump unit into it and
then it acts as both a pump top to
theoretically improve performance so I
don't really care about that as well as
a reservoir so that's probably the route
we're going to go for that one of the
other things I'm sort of considering
since I'm going to have to go to
probably a plating shop anyway to get
these to get these stripped is maybe
plating the Copperheads because right
now there's no way I'd consider using
these in the build just because the
color scheme is just I mean terrible you
can't have silver remember this is like
a true silver color silver gold and
copper in the same build that simply
will not fly but I do have two of these
so I could potentially do one on each
side of the memory in order to show I
mean it's gonna be really busy tubing
why so so yeah I still got to think
about that whether or not I want a water
cooler Ram I know there's no performance
benefit don't worry guys I know this
isn't even real copper head memory this
is just such this is just cheap memory
with with the copper head heat spreader
look it's just ddr3
1600 cl9 like there's nothing special
about it
but I just wanted the copperhead sink so
that I focus focus Copperhead sinks so
that I could do so I could show them off
in the ultimate water cooling guide so
uh that was my whole motivation there uh
what are other things that I I want to
sort of talk about I can show you guys
more about that machine you can see how
disgusting it gets with all the like cat
hair and like look at that I can't even
I can't even scrape this off I might
even have to like pressure wash this
thing I'm not really sure how I'm going
to get it clean I thought about painting
the case itself but I love the finish of
the Silverstone tjo 7 so I yeah I think
I'd be doing a disservice to this
particular case by by painting and it's
really not in that bad shape this is a
very durable finish that's on this
particular case especially on here the
side panels are not in nearly as good
condition but painting is is an
expenditure once again that I don't
really need and with you know rotten
creatures like that one over there it's
yeah likely to get scratched and all
that so uh one other small problem I
have is that my motherboard tray one of
the you can see that the one right in
the center of the frame that hole is
actually bigger than the other two one
of those is stripped so I've thought
about whether or not I want to bother
trying to get a new one from Silverstone
or something like that I I don't know
what to do about that I mean I could
reach out them all a different size and
use like custom screws in order to hold
in all my adding cards but once again
it's kind of like do I want to go
through the hassle because the thing
that's going to be installed in there is
going to be the graphics card which is
going to have two screws in it anyhow so
I'm not really that concerned about it
um well yeah the last thing I'm probably
going to powdercoat is the housing for
this
so since I'm sending it down to two
mountain mods I might as well have them
deal with that as well and then I think
that's it for for metal stuff I'm going
to stick with my my shiny shiny PCI slot
covers I really like the look of these
um you know goes with stuff like this
sort of you can't really tell but this
is also very mirror finish is just dusty
yeah there we go
okay so I'm moving on to the next thing
oh yeah along the same note of the gunk
that's built up and that that GTX 480
block that caused my whole loop to go
all cloudy and murky I mean this is the
state of the tubing that that was in my
that was in my loop at the time I'm
gonna have to do something about my
radiators because I'm not going to
replace them because that's hold on I'm
just gonna turn off the auto white
balance or rather turn it on just okay
so we're in the bathroom here so yeah
once again it's an expenditure I don't
really need and you can't even you can't
even really get a better radiator than
the one I'm already using anyway the
thermo chill one so what is the point I
might as well do what I can in order to
salvage it right I know what I lost the
tubing I was going to use give me a sec
guys so this is not the best way to
cleanse radiators so I got my thermal
chill 1/4 by 120ml and I've got this is
this is awesome this is my hardware labs
black ice pro 2 this is the first
radiator I ever bought it's in horrible
shape all of these threads are stripped
to hell but I hold on to it just because
you know my one it's one of the few
things I have left although I still have
my Apogee my original Swift Tech Apogee
which was also my first water cooling
like custom water cooling loop so yeah I
continue to use it because you can't
really see it anyway so yeah ah here you
can actually see I don't know if you
guys can see that you see all the gunk
in the water there you can see like dust
and particulate matter that's obviously
part of the water cooling now that it's
got all those metal corrosion bits
loading around in it so to cleanse these
if I was a purist I would probably be
using some kind of like filtration
system or
something like that but what I'm going
to do since I'm just going to get o it
is just run water I might do hot water
at first and then switch over to cold
water and run it all night but I'm just
going to hook these two radiators up I'm
going to take this piece of tubing and
I'm going to tape it into the faucet
how's that for our product placement
right there
drop that tape down there and then I'm
just going to run the water for a little
bit here I know this is not the best way
to do this just because of a couple
things so one is the the metal ions that
can exist in tap water so yeah that's
going to leave a bit of a deposit here
but I think the net result is still
going to be better than what I had going
on in there before it's a bit of a waste
of water as well the good news is I live
in British Columbia Canada where water
costs almost nothing a cats very curious
about what the heck's going on in his
sink this is sort of the cat bathroom
because they have their food their water
in there so yeah they're I think that's
pretty much the update for now cleaning
up my water cooling stuff and still some
decisions to be made got to send away
some parts oh it might be a little while
before I have another update but I will
keep you guys posted don't forget to
