brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital this is part two of the
Asus component suite which you might
notice has more systems in it than
components sometimes I'm not a hundred
percent sure how they divide these
things up anyway this is the m70 desktop
pc for masseuse and i'll tell you guys
that there's no way you can really
differentiate a desktop system based on
you know oh well you know we put a
processor and ram in it and well so did
everyone else well asus is trying to do
a few things differently with this one
so number one is the fact that it comes
with a fan sticking vertically out the
top of it this is the first time we've
seen this design ever and what's more
unique about this is the fact that guys
know it does not come with the fan this
is a Qi standard wireless charging point
so they've got a little coil rigged up
here on the bottom of this fan and
they're just showing off how it works if
we had a phone all we'd have to do is
pop it down on top and not only would it
charge but there's also an NFC pad there
as well so you can use it for things
like unlocking your your PC you can use
it for things like launching apps or for
transferring your files and photos and
cool stuff like that so it's got
charging and nsv NFC on the top the last
thing that's really unique about this
system is the fact that it has a
built-in UPS no not a psu a UPS is
completely different it has a built-in
battery backup that they actually tested
earlier today and found that it'll run
for about eight minutes this gives you
an opportunity even in the event of a
complete power failure to backup your
data before you lose it which i think is
pretty darn cool so there you go it's a
desktop PC okay it's got a core i7 4770
it's got a GTX 650 and all that kind of
stuff but more importantly it has
features that might actually enhance the
way you use your pc for this next
product we have a couple of things that
are new number one is the new
Transformer p 1802 aio so it's been
updated with a fourth generation series
intel processor inside so that's
code-named Haswell as well as a Tegra 4
processor because i don't know if you
guys remember this or not but the
transformer AIO features a full windows
a pc in the base station as a standalone
18.4 inch tablet the other thing that is
new about this particular video is our
Vanna White Vanna you've put on some
weight what do you have to say about
that I've been trying a new diet out
it's not working also you're much
hairier than before well it involves
mostly eating poutine which I find
delicious the last thing to tell you
guys hear that site pretty darn cool
because it's just got so many requests
i'm just going to cover up vana here
with this very cool product they are now
releasing the transformer AIO s tablet
as a standalone a 21 and a half inch
android tablet in addition to allowing
you to buy it with the base station so
if all you wanted was a gigantic tablet
now's the time finishing up part two of
our ASIS component sweet tour we have
the our TAC 87 you we don't know much
about this other than the fact that it
is a dual band four by four so that's
four antennas also it has the ability to
dynamically I'll allocate its wireless
bandwidth according to the speed of the
client on the other side or at least the
connectivity type of the client on the
other side we don't know what it looks
like because this is not the finished
industrial design and we don't know
pricing but we could probably
extrapolate based on other you know AC
the top-of-the-line asus routers it'll
be somewhere in the neighborhood of 220
or so dollars and it will be faster than
we've ever seen before guys don't miss
any of our CES 2014 coverage here at the
show our trip here was powered by NCI
XCOM your source for great technology
selection and service as well as corsair
Memory and western digital without those
guys we would not have been able to be
here bringing you this content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
