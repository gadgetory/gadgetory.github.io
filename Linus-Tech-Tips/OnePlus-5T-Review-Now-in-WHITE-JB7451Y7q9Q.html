along that sparks a conversation or that
changes the way that we use our mobile
devices and for the people who don't
actually want to carry around adaptors
and relearn all of their gestures well
for them there's the one plus 5t a
purely incremental improvement over the
one plus five and now in zen still white
today's video is brought to you by be
quiet the dark bass 700 is an extremely
versatile case featuring RGB LED
lighting and a tempered glass side panel
window check it out at the link below
I first checked out the five T when
oneplus sponsored my trip to their New
York launch event and since then I've
spent about a month using it and I've
got a few impressions to share one plus
is slogan is never settle but if we're
being honest they come in at a lower
price with a few key feature trade-offs
against the top-tier flagship so isn't
that exactly what they're asking us to
do well when it comes to construction
quality the original black 5 t feels
good with a great curved shape nice
clicky buttons and a satisfyingly smooth
body to glass transition and then the
sandstone white adds a little bit more
grip and subjectively a better look
though with that said if you're the type
to apply a deep brand skin this might
not be a huge issue for you the one area
where you are settling is water
resistance and this is something that I
would really hope to see oneplus address
in the 6 moving onto specs here's a
rundown of the freshly launched
sandstone white edition it's exactly the
same as the regular 5t which is pretty
much the same as any other flagship
smartphone at least until Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 to start showing up in
the wild sometime later this year the
decent sized 3300 milliamp hour battery
combined with the lower 2160 by 1080
resolution on the 18 by 9 OLED display
amounts to a settling or a compromise of
sorts but it's not one that I think
anyone is likely to notice in day-to-day
use
I got great battery life out of the 5 T
regularly making it through very
demanding days and the screen was sharp
with no off-axis viewing anomalies or
burnin on either of my units and
watching movies and the wider aspect
ratio was a treat aside from the bottom
mounted single speaker which I would
like to see addressed on the 6 as well
on the software we are settling a little
bit again to be clear I actually really
like oxygen OS it's damn close to stock
Android but with a few thoughtful
add-ons like better screenshot
management shortcut key
one pluses signature notification toggle
and this really cool feature that I've
mostly only seen on Asian focused phones
the ability to run multiple installs of
apps so you don't have to switch your
login profile all the time which is a
huge boon for anyone with separate work
and personal social media accounts like
me however instead of shipping with Oreo
like the pixel to we're stuck with
nougat until one plus rolls an update
sometime in 2018 and you can't count on
the support period either the three and
the three T both got Android nougat with
Oreo to come but the two which was
released in mid 2015 is still stuck on
marshmallow so your mileage may vary now
let's talk about the quality of life
things oneplus is facial unlock isn't as
good as face ID on the iPhone 10 or even
Samsung's iris scanner from my anecdotal
experience but now that winters rolled
around it is a heck of a lot better than
nothing so I definitely prefer that to
taking my hands out of my gloves or my
pockets though it should be noted that
when I wasn't wearing gloves I was
really pleased with the performance of
the rear mounted fingerprint sensor even
if I do continue to prefer front
placement as for the camera well ditto I
guess it's missing some top-tier
features like 480 fps slo-mo and it's
not across-the-board quite as good as
the best flagships out there but there
are a couple of things that it does
really well one it just works
it's got Pro Mode options like the
ability to see an on-screen histogram
and shoot in RAW but the default app and
it's default mode is super simple to use
and gets it right enough most of the
time and even their portrait mode it's
actually pretty good among the ones
we've tested and two with the second
camera actually dedicated to low-light I
got some really impressive shots in very
challenging situations like in a dimly
lit aircraft I mean it's not like you're
gonna be able to do up a poster sized
print with acceptable quality but if you
gauge a cellphone camera on it
ability to capture the moment the 5t
with its quick launch with the DoubleTap
it's fast shutter and acceptable image
quality performs admirably so I guess by
this point in the video you've probably
picked up on my point by now the never
settle slogan is a bit I don't know
let's call it optimistic but I'm still
going to recommend the five T because at
five hundred bucks for the base model
it's cheaper than anything else that I
would consider competitive with the
overall user experience also a sort of
related comment literally as I sat down
to write this script my type C two
three-and-a-half millimeter adapter died
forcing me to toss aside my daily driver
pixel to excel for the five T so I could
plug in and jam out to some tunes like
bloody hell telephone industry why are
you doing this to me and as for oneplus
thank you for at least putting it off
for one more cycle speaking of putting
it off why are you guys putting off
getting a D brand skin for your mobile
device or other device D brand makes
awesome skins for laptops phones tablets
consoles controllers and more they use
high quality authentic true textured 3m
vinyl on every product their cuts are
unbeatably precise they measure many
times to ensure they have a factory fit
for your product and not only do they
look great deep brown skins protect
against incidental damage and scratches
and many of them are grippier than the
stock finishes of your favorite devices
so check them out they're affordable
they ship worldwide and they're
available at the link below so thanks

awesome get subscribed hit that like
