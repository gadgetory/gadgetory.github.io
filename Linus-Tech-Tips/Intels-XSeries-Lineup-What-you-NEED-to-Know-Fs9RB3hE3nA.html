that their product naming scheme could
be less confusing where that level is
well your guess is as good as mine
because they have certainly never
admitted it to us and yet here we are
with an Intel sponsored deeper dive into
the core x-series their high-end desktop
processors where we'll cover the key
options available and what they might be
most useful for
okay so first a little context Intel's X
299 platform is divided up into two
major architectures KB Lake X and
skylake x kb Lake X is essentially their
consumer 7000-series chips with more
heavy duty traces slightly higher clock
speeds and the higher power consumption
that goes with it as a result it differs
significantly from other CPUs that fit
into the LGA 2066 socket Intel intends
them as entry-level chips for folks who
want to get into an h EDT or high end
desktop motherboard and then upgrade
later but so far they've been most
successful in competitive overclocking
especially in light of the six core
options that are available on the Z 370
consumer side of things now skylake acts
on the other hand is where the meet set
here we've got two classes of processors
core i7 and core i 9 all of them have
unlocked multipliers for overclocking
Intel hyper-threading technology quad
channel ddr4 memory support for avx2 and
avx-512 x86 extensions and they share
skylake X's new cache set up of 1 Meg of
level 2 cache per core matched with a
shared level 3 cache that's much smaller
than previous generations but in
practice proves more efficient in most
scenarios where they differ is in the
core count which increments by 2 for
each step up the product stack the
number of PCI Express Lanes which is
lower on core i7 models and the
implementation of turbo boost max 3.0 so
CPUs with 8 cores or more get to max
boost course while the 7800 X gets zero
turbo boost max course now we won't be
doing a deep dive on every SKU just the
top tier core i 979 ATX e to show what
the platform is capable of in
multi-threaded and virtualized workloads
the core I 970 900 X the
jack-of-all-trades and the core i7 78
20x which we believe should be the entry
level CPU for most buyers
on this platform let's start with that
last one it has 28 PCI Express Lanes so
that's enough for a full speed graphics
card a couple of nvme SSDs and some
high-speed networking so it's about
right for an entry-level workstation
which is great because that's where this
chips performance shines it actually has
the highest base frequency in the entire
sky like X lineup it shares the highest
boost frequency with the 7900 X and it
also shares the highest to poor turbo
boost max 3.0 frequency at 4.5 gigahertz
making it a great fit for a workstation
that isn't always used for work
moving into core I nine territory we
leave behind the 28 PCIe lanes and step
up to 44 where we get perhaps the most
interesting CPU in the x2 99 line up the
10 core core I 970 900 X when this guy
launched we reviewed it quite favorably
thanks to its major performance
improvements over its predecessor the
core i7 69 hundred K and even the 69 50
X now to be clear not everyone is going
to see a performance improvement versus
the 78 20x but if you want to have full
unbought all necked access to many
connected PCI Express devices be they
networking storage video capture or
expensive accelerator cards this is
where you want to be and you get another
two cores four workloads that can take
advantage of them as well the rest of
the core i9 lineup is what I would
describe as tweeners that is they are in
between the 7900 x 2 cores per step and
the highest end cpu intel has ever
released on a desktop platform the
$2000.00 18 core core i9 79 80 XE this
thing is an absolute beast and it shows
in both its performance numbers and its
power drum it blitz through our testing
suite pulling off similar per thread
performance numbers to its fewer core
brethren and even beating out our 22
core xeon e5 2699
v4 and it managed to pull 500 to 600
watts on its own when overclocked it
doesn't win any bang for the buck gaming
awards but for those that need this kind
of performance be they video editors
three the animators using fluid
simulation or anyone who's doing
high-end computational work that can't
be offloaded onto a GPU well it could be
that for you raw performance is all that
matters because time is money and a cpu
that outputs faster can pay for itself
pretty quickly skylake X represents a
healthy improvement upon the previous
generation and it's a solid choice when
it comes to both per thread and
multi-threaded performance now we just
hope that Intel's plan for a more
dynamic and risky future brings us even
more performance next year and the year
after that because we're insatiable like
that so thanks for watching guys if you
dislike this video you can hit that
