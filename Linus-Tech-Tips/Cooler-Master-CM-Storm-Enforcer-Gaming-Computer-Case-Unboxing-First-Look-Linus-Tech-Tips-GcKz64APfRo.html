storm and for cert so this is a new case
from coolermaster it is a value oriented
option so it is a sub $100 case and as
you may or may not be able to tell right
off the bat the front of it is stylized
kind of like the helmet of a knight so
that's why they've got this knight guy
next to it although it seems to be some
kind of like futuristic Knight because
he seems to have technology on him and
glowing lights and whatnot rather than
just armor so here is a picture of the
case here is a picture of well more
detailed pictures of the case so we're
not gonna worry too much about those
right now since we are going to be
opening up the box here we have
specifications so it's all black that
means including the interior it does
have a black interior here's the
dimensions here's the weight it takes
ATX motherboard so it does have 7 PCI
expansion slots plus one auxilary one
that you can use for fan controllers or
anything like that it's made of steel
plastic and mesh it has four exposed
five and a quarter inch bays one
external three-and-a-half inch as well
as six internal three and a half inch it
has four two and a half inch trace base
so I'll show you how those work once we
get inside usb3 this is huge
USB three with a an internal header so
that means that all those new p67 boards
that use internal headers instead of
goofy like pass throughs to the back of
the board this will support it so that
is a huge selling feature right there a
couple USB 2 comes with a front 200
millimeter fan a rear 120 millimeter fan
and it's got a couple optional fans at
200 in the top and a 120 on the side
over your graphics card here we are it
accepts video cards up to 390
millimeters with the hard drive cage
removes well you only have to remove one
of them so 390 millimeters is what about
15 inches 16 into something like that so
I wouldn't worry too much about running
into any graphics card for the time
being that will not fit in this case
because even the Radeon 6990 and the
59 1769 59 7 yep even those video cards
will fit in here without any issues and
they're both about 12 inches long and
they're the longest ones on the market
so it comes with a an operator's manual
next we will find and removing it from
the box this is the unboxing portion of
our video all right so we find packing
material to match pieces made of a stiff
foam so while it's probably not the best
packing material in the world you prefer
the soft closed cell foam it is thick
enough and this case is light enough
that I really wouldn't worry about any
damage in transit to the CM storm
enforcer
and then remove the plastic so we can
see the case itself now so let's just do
a little tour of the exterior of the
Chaffee alright so first thing we see is
the front as I mentioned before it has
kind of a night looking appearance to it
so this is sort of overlapping armor
plates and then right here we have a
grill where presumably the night would
be able to speak to others you know
battle cries and whatnot all that good
stuff you can clearly see through the
front the 200 millimeter intake fan so
that has a red LED on it so it should
look quite imposing from the front on
this side actually you know what let's
finish up at the front first before I
get ahead of myself so this is held
closed by magnets and you can see here
your four or five and a quarter inch
base with one optional three and a half
inch external if you've got a card
reader or something else like that that
goes in a three and a half inch external
bay your reset switch is and I actually
really like this right next to your
power switch but safe from you
accidentally hitting it whenever you
have the front door closed and given how
rarely you need to use an optical drive
these days this will pretty much always
be closed so you won't accidentally hit
your reset switch you got your power led
here your hard drive activity led here
microphone and headphone ports two USB
2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports and I'll
show you guys that internal header in a
minute you've got a convenient drink
tray document tray CD tray whatever kind
of things you happen to need to put
there maybe you want or your manual
there if you want to put your keys there
no problem storage area on the top of
the case I actually really like that
then you've got another 200 millimeter
fan mount but it'll also mount other
stuff so by the look of things you can
throw another two 120 mils there but it
does not support a radiator due to
clearance issues inside so you'd be
looking at two just two fans okay in the
top however it does support a 120
millimeter rad in the back so since
we're going around talking about the
back why don't we have a look at the
back so here's your 120 mm fan in the
back that's included
supporter rad it has enough clearance
around the bottom and around the top for
that you got water cooling grommets if
you wanted to do an external radiator
set up okay some people do do those and
you've got your standard back flip io
backplate shield pepper missing thing
well it's not missing but you put it in
when you get it with your motherboard
then you have the seven PCI slots plus
the one auxilary one I mentioned so for
example some coolers come with a little
speed adjustment dial for the fan you
put that there rather than using up one
of your valuable PCI slots supports
standard ATX power supplies and you can
see it has all eight mounting holes so
you can mount your power supply either
with the fan down or with the fan on top
depending on whatever you prefer you're
not locked down to one way like I've
seen with some cases in the past so give
me a sec to take these screws off and
then we'll be back now I've been saying
this for a long time but what is the
point of a black interior if you don't
have a side panel window to show it off
so well I mean it's not a complaint
about this case obviously because it has
a side panel window so I've taken off
the covers that come to protect it
during shipping
it has also some where the overlapping
arm or effect belt into the side panel
you can see the window is quite clean so
it is attached via grommets here around
the outside and it is pretty yeah it's
actually flush with the steel of the
side panel so you just slide that off
pretty much the standard way to remove
any case side panel from some case
pretty much ever other than the ones
that try and get creative about it and
inside we will find oh you know what I'm
actually gonna remove this side panel as
well so that I can show you guys the
whole interior of this chassis
accessories box why don't we do this
first for a change I always do this at
the end and frequently end up forgetting
it entirely so I'm just gonna get this
out of the way here so in here we find
Drive rails alright so these are for
mounting your three and a half inch
drives in the 2list cages here so you
just push those into the sides of the
drives either side click in and there
you go coolermaster actually does a
great job of their hard drive mounting
mechanisms I'm a big fan because they're
secure easy to use and I mean is that is
there really anything else you can ask
for when it comes to mounting a hard
drive okay we've got some black zip ties
we have a motherboard speakers so that
old beep if you're having problems with
your system or whatever else the case
may be since it's not built into the
case and since a lot of people don't
want them anyway that's just fine we've
got screws here as well so there's your
motherboard screws any other screws you
might need as well as a way to lock the
side panel should you so desire so you
can this functionality is not built-in
but you can throw that on there and then
all of a sudden you can put a padlock on
the side panel if you want if you're
going to Land's or whatever else and you
want to protect your valuable hardware
now this feature is another one that as
far as I can tell and this is a bit of a
guess but it's called storm guard it is
for safeguarding your gaming peripherals
and from what I can see it looks like
what you do is if you're going to a LAN
or you're using it in a public place you
put this in that looks yeah throw it at
the case and then break everything you
put this in the auxiliary PCI slot here
you run your cable inside pass it
through this hook and then run it back
outside and plug it into the back of
your i/o panel so what that means is
that without and then once you put a
padlock on the side tunnel without
removing your side panel and removing
this no one can take your peripherals
away because the cable is routed through
the inside of your case so that they
can't steal it
pretty much
okay so there's that we also have this
whatever it is it's like Christmas just
opening things happen not knowing what
they are wow that just looks like drive
adapter okay so that's probably you D
five and a quarter to three and a half
inch drive it after there and finally we
have this dual Oh how's that word neat
okay we have a three and a half inch to
two and a half inch drive bay adapter as
well alright finally the case itself so
why don't we have why don't we start
with let's start at the front so here's
our six hard drive bays what how is that
the front what's the camera and even
looking at Oh
designed by Coolermaster yes he's
looking at the stamp here that says
designed by Coolermaster that's very
good cameraman okay why don't we start
at the top front so we've got four or
five and a quarter inch bays these are
all using tooless mechanisms although
should you so desire you want to just
back up a second should you so desire
you can also put screws into your drives
from the other side so that way you have
the convenience of tool free with the
security of putting in a screw should
you need to ship the system or do
anything like that moving down you have
a removable three and a half inch drive
cage so that supports four drives you
can remove the whole thing and then
under that you have a fixed one so you
can see this one uses rivets two by
three and a half inch drive cage you
have another removable drive cage this
one is for two and a half inch drives
right here so that one supports two you
just take out a couple screws here slide
it out and smell your drives and put it
back in conveniently lined up with the
cable management the holes here so you
can deliver the power and SATA cables up
to wherever it is that they need to go
from those drives ok moving down we've
got four rubber mounts here for your
power supply in a case like this I'm
probably recommend using the fan facing
down because you can see here you've got
a filter this is appears to be removable
although it might be a bit challenging
you've got a filtered intake for your
120 millimeter fan on the bottom of your
power supply that way it keeps the cool
phones separate from the rest of your
case rather than sucking up hot air that
is being exhausted by your graphics card
okay the PCI slots we've pretty much
covered the 120 mil fan in the back
we've pretty much talked about you've
got a a CPU cutout so that means that if
you want to mount a CPU cooler that uses
a backplate you do not need to remove
the motherboard to mount it you can just
take off your backside panel and mount
it that way up here you can see what I
was talking about because the top of
your motherboards gonna be right here so
by the time you install a radiator and a
fan you're not gonna have enough
clearance so that is fans strictly up
here in the top all right micro ATX 8 X
okay let's have a look at what we've got
for included front panel connectors even
though we've pretty much already talked
about them when we looked at the front
panel itself here we are so there are
your front switches and LEDs all that
good stuff color coded next we have our
front HD audio nice long cable for that
so you'll be able to reach you know
depending what motherboard manufacturer
using got like a goofy one right here
for example you'll be able to reach it
just fine you've got your USB 2.0 nice
black cables and then finally here we
are USB 3.0 so that is your USB 3.0
internal header lots of other boards
have them here or here so you'll be able
to reach that regardless and I think
that pretty much covers everything I
wanted to say about the enforcer don't
