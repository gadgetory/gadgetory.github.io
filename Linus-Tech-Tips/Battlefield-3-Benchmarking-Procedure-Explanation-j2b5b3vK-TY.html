trusted graphics partner nvidia welcome
to my battlefield 3 benchmarking guide
where it will be hosted by not me slick
hosts these so you guys will be going
along with him on a little run through
so we're not doing any performance
results in this one so the rig he's
using is his personal rig which is a
2600 k and a 660 ti actually it's not
this 660 ti it's some completely
different one so don't worry too much
about that but whatever frame rates you
guys see those are on random settings
we're not really standardizing anything
so don't worry too much about it but
he's also going to explain what happened
with some frame rate dips that occur due
to save games so what we're showing you
guys is the two-minute run through that
we use at various settings usually on I
believe its extreme preset or ultra
preset or whatever the very highest one
is because battlefield runs pretty darn
well its ultra and so it's a two minute
run through the conrads level in a
specific way so you'll get all the tips
you need for how to run the benchmark
exactly the way we do so you can easily
compare against all the graphics cards
that we're testing as well as comparing
your rig against what we've got over
here alright so after that really long
cinematic what we're going to do is just
run up to this way point here and cut
the wires inside the room you want to
just start the benchmark right when you
start running so the second you start
running away from the cars when you
start the benchmark just cut the wires
right here you'll notice a little bit of
a frame dip right there right when I
started saving that's mainly because I'm
recording with fraps at the same time
usually it doesn't really feel that at
all right here I just walk behind
Vladimir Hagar things named Vladimir and
then the other guy kind of skirts are on
the left side wait for him to get a
little bit in front of me and then I'll
start running as well I just don't want
to absolutely run into anyone to make
inconsistencies I'm just gonna take
these guys out here
Oh apparently he didn't die there we go
taking him out now we're gonna skirt
around the right side of these pillars
because its existence again and then
what you're mainly going to do here is
just fight take everybody out this part
can get a little bit hectic but if you
run it a few times there is a bit of a
rhythm to it the enemies come out like
the guys that came out of the stairs
right there will come out from the
stairs of the exact some time every time
different people behind different
pillars might slightly change but the
fight is generally similar stuff like
that guy over there can be anomalies
he's not usually running there but just
make sure you take everyone out you'll
notice the saving point when everyone
dies and then wait for them to get on
each side of the door and then run
through why that bike was there I have
no idea but it's not really a big deal
follow them down here then you'll notice
three enemies coming up from the right
side just fit yourself in between these
two cars and take them out if the lights
are really annoying but they go in the
same three fixed positions every time so
we're something that big we do again
there's a little bit of a frame dip
there but that's mainly cuz I'm
recording the fraps at the same time and
it went for safe just to make timing of
the benchmarks consistent at the very
end shoot these windows out you don't
want to run much further down because
there's a rocket that will come out and
hit that pillar and that will make your
benchmark inconsistent so to sit up here
and shoot the windows and then you're
done thanks for watching guys as always
don't forget to subscribe and like and
do all those little things with the
clicky mouse that is attached to the
computer with the USB and all of that
good stuff and hey we'd love for you
guys to check out our forum so there is
a link in the description of the video
where we have a thread where you guys
can actually post your own results since
you're all running the same standardized
benchmark now it's easy to compare and
you don't have to worry about sort of
optimization here or can benchmark there
because everything here is running
pretty much the same thing in a
real-world gaming environment so see you
guys next time for more benchmarking
guides and all that kind of good stuff
and I think I'm pretty much done here
