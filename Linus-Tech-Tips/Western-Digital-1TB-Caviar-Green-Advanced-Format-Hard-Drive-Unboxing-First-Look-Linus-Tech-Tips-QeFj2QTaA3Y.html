that we are back in our outdoor unboxing
location yay and to celebrate the
occasion we are going to be unboxing
another Western digital one terabyte
hard drive yay no I'm just kidding
there's something special about this
this is a Western Digital one terabyte
green hard drive but the thing that you
should notice about it is besides having
a 64 Meg cash which is thumbs up it is a
WD 10 years so the EA RS in the part
number means that this is an advanced
format drive
now what advanced format means is that
this drive uses four kilobyte sectors
instead of 512 byte sectors what that
means in layman's terms is that the
drive is able to in the future with this
technology achieve much greater data
densities than a more traditional Drive
so why don't we get started with the
unboxing or unbagging as it were of this
Western Digital green ears drive so
there's the drive itself and inside we
will find oh I'm very fond of these do
not eat okay silica gel don't eat that
please thank you these are not little um
like bubble key things that don't have
them okay so let's look at the drive
physically first so it's a pretty
typical three and a half inch drive you
got your three mounting holes on the one
side you got nothing here you have three
mounting holes on the other side on the
bottom you will find your pretty
standard looking PCB with two mounting
holes on either side and then at the
back you will find a standard SATA power
as well as a SATA to interface with some
jumper pins and whatnot now I want to
talk a little bit about it what Advanced
Format means now Advanced Format won't
bother newer operating systems like Mac
OS X Vista or Windows 7 but if you are
running and I'm just going to put this
up here so that everyone can see it if
you are running Windows XP with a multi
partition or you are using cloning
software you need to use the WD align
software available at WWDC comm /a DV
format so that's advanced format and
then you will be able
to use that tool to make the drive
perform properly because if you don't
the partition will not be aligned
properly with the new sector size and
the drive will perform very very poorly
okay now if you are running Windows XP
with a single partition it's as simple
as setting jumper seven to eight prior
to installation or using the WD line
software now they recommend using the WD
align software rather than the jumper
just because it's a more complete
solution but the jumper will work if you
just want a grab and go sort of way to
get this running right out of the box
all other OS configurations the drive is
ready for use as is like I mentioned
before so Windows Vista Windows 7 OS X
don't even think about it
whereas with Windows XP and you remember
that's a seven eight year old operating
system at this point
it didn't know that we were going to
make this radical change so with Windows
XP make sure you either set jumper seven
and eight or use the WD line software
thanks for checking out my unboxing and
I think we're done now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
