Full-time Graphic Designer &amp; Part-time Video Editor</b></h2><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3b-7oGir6zI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">so we've actually been criticized in the
past for putting job posting videos up
on our YouTube channel
apparently we won't find the right
people there and it's unprofessional who
cares we're hiring videos have brought
us over the years Luke John Anthony Alex
and James and you know now that I think
about it that's a good point
those guys all totally suck you know
what I'm gonna go post this in the local
newspaper instead no I'm just kidding
so anyway we're looking for a couple of
things this time around a graphic
designer
with clothing design aspirations and a
part-time Video Editor with some camera
experience or in a perfect world a
single magical unicorn who is able to do
both so the graphic designers
responsibility on his or her first day
would be to hit Edie with the wife and
pillow for leaving me to wear this aging
man hoodie design for the last two years
then from there we're looking to create
like pitch decks for sponsors Twitter
profile banners and stuff like that so
like boring things but also dramatically
increase both the quality and variety of
our merch offerings and not just like
more random stuff with like an LTT logo
on it I mean we'll do some of that but
we want to focus on fully custom stuff
that normal people would want to wear so
some familiarity with clothing and
merchandise sourcing would actually be a
huge plus the position is full-time in
Surrey British Columbia so you will need
a Canadian work permit please don't
waste my time and yours if you don't
have one position number two video
editor so you need to be able to edit
videos in the style of LTT tech quickie
and then potentially a new channel
that's right you heard it here first
folks we might be working on a new
channel actually we're definitely
working on a new channel otherwise why
would we put up a job posting for a new
channel so you'll find the full details
first
omitting your cover letter resume and
portfolio in the video description
this position is part-time in Surrey BC
and again please don't waste my time in
yours if you don't have a Canadian work
permit we cannot hire you if you cannot
legally work in Canada and in response
to your question about working remotely
no we've tried it it sucks we're not
doing it so good luck everyone this
video is brought to you by no I'm just
kidding there's no sponsor I'm done</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
