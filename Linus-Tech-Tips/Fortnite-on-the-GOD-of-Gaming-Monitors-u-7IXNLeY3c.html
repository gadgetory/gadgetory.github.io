been waiting for this actually that can
be calculated because I first showed
this awful is it C yes a year and a half
ago this it's finally here is a soos is
144 Hertz 4k HDR with a thousand nits
peak brightness g-sync gaming monitor
this is it this is quite literally
monitor god mode it has everything and
we get to be the first to take a
finished model for a test drive and
finished comes with a big asterisk
because this isn't quite final hardware
and we don't have quite the final
drivers but speaking of not being able
to wait you won't be able to wait to try
out glass wire glass wire is a firewall
that displays your PC's incoming and
outgoing network connections in real
time and you can use offer code Linus to
get 25% off glass wire 2.0 check it out
at the link below
okay so step number one is to get this
bad boy and I did assume it's gender I'm
sorry get this bad mofo get this thing
set up it's so long for this and it's
not a Seuss's fault so they say although
I think NVIDIA has actually been pretty
upfront that it's that it's been their
fault so what has delayed it it's not
anything about the panel like they just
hope this thing working the past
what's delayed it has been getting HDR
working with g-sync
because individually those technologies
are complicated enough and having them
working at the same time because this
isn't like your typical HD aren't like
those monitors out there that claim to
have HDR support where they'll accept an
HDR 10 input but they have maybe 350 or
maybe 450 netpeak brightness this uses
384 zones of full array back lighting in
order to achieve 1008 peak brightness
and deep blacks at least in theory so
we've only seen it at this stage of
production on the BFG big effing
displays that Nvidia showed at CES this
year you can actually see like
physically this thing is loaded for bear
I mean you don't have a full array back
light without compromising on things
like thickness so a Seuss's literature
claims it can draw up to a hundred and
eighty watts from the wall it's thick
it's got big old thick bezels which they
justify by saying realistically you
weren't gonna be running more than one
of these off of a single system at 4k
144 FPS anyway and I mean I guess that's
all there is to really say about it
physically in there get it turned on oh
oh no there is more while James is
getting the system set up let's take you
guys for a quick tour of the stand
so it goes up and down about like yay it
goes side to side about like yeah it
tilts up and down about like yeah and it
pivots about like yay so if you if you
like your 4k 144 Hertz this way because
you're some kind of a monster and you're
playing Peggle or something
alternately you can use this for exactly
what I use it for which is easier access
to the i/o so it's got a single HDMI 2.0
though it should be noted that even hdmi
2.0 is nowhere near able to run 144
Hertz 4k you're gonna be limited to 60
Hertz and then DisplayPort 1.4 and that
is where the magic happens with a
compatible graphics card you can drive
that massive resolution over a single
cable oh and it also has a USB hub and a
pass-through audio jack oh okay so no
we're not ready to turn it on quite yet
because I guess we have to talk about
the lighting effects so it's got its got
a customizable underglow you can put
your own lens in there and have it say
or show whatever you want you just write
on the included blanks with a sharpie
it's got a projected ROG logo that it
fires at the wall behind it see that
coming out of the back here it's got a
matching our oh it's kind of matching
our FG logo on the stand right here and
then it's got full auto sync
compatibility on the RGB logo on the
back because that's the side of this
monitor that I'm gonna look at emit I
don't actually know the final pricing
but if I'm gonna pay however much this
thing's gonna cost I want to enjoy it
from every side every side let's start
by making sure that we're running at 4k
144 Hertz
ah okay because getting that going is a
little bit tricky you do need to make
sure you're using a high quality display
port cable and that's actually an
overclocked refresh rate so what happens
is you enable max refresh rate 144 Hertz
in the control panel of the monitor and
then it enables 144 Hertz 4k now you are
giving up something here because as soon
as you go past I think it's 96 Hertz at
4k you're gonna be giving up some of the
chroma subsampling so you're gonna be
giving up some of your color
reproduction and if you actually look
really closely here we're getting a
little bit of fringing on the text but
the theory is that you're not gonna
really notice this in games so let's go
ahead and hit up csgo
now this is a game that should actually
be able to run at 4k 144 frames per
second even at pretty high details on
this hardware but that's not going to be
true of most things even though we're
running a GTX 1080 Ti and we've got an
email from a soos literally nine minutes
ago saying that Titan V should also work
a lot of games are just straight-up not
going to be able to take take advantage
of the 144 Hertz refresh rate which is I
guess where g-sync comes in because even
if you're hovering between 45 and 85
it's gonna look smooth so csgo doesn't
support HDR so what we've done is turned
it off in the windows control panel this
thing is water smooth you can't even see
an individual pixel now I've seen this
display running in demos but I've never
actually been able to drive we check
this out like Brendon even look at stuff
that's like far away like this and we're
running at 144 frames per second like
from a reasonable distance and like even
without any backlight strobing as I move
back and forth
you can still read text so fortnight's
not the most demanding game out there
but at 4k everything but AAA set to epic
I still am expecting this to be a little
bit challenging here we go
so even with a GTX 10 atti we're looking
at about 75 65 frames per second is this
guy following me dude I don't know what
I'm doing so initial impressions here
although we aren't running an HDR
our that dang it our that the chroma
subsampling doesn't seem to be hurting
us yet but we are gonna reserve judgment
for when is this really a real player
wow you suck it actually helps to offset
it that you've got these nice little
backgrounds or drop shadows on all the
text because that's where you'd be most
likely to see it but we're gonna reserve
full judgement for when we do the full
review on the finished hardware with the
finished drivers this does look really
good though I gotta say I am impressed
with everything depth of blacks vibrance
of colors without overdoing it it looks
really good okay so for HDR we're gonna
enable it within the windows control
panel you do need a handful of things
obviously supported graphics card with
the right firm where apparently nvidia
is planning to release a firmware
updater tool just in case you have an
older 1080 TI that needs to be flashed
you need the latest spring creators
update and of course you need a title
like destiny - that has support for HDR
so we're tuning up our graphics settings
for destiny - honestly we're not even
gonna try and crank this because even
with SLI which has been sort of a an
abandoned stepchild for both NVIDIA and
game developers over the last little
while we're not gonna expect to be able
to run a game like this at max settings
144 Hertz have you bad guys cool I can
definitely feel the reduction in
framerate but it's very usable I gotta
say my biggest criticism of the big
effing gaming displays was that while
the blacks are really deep like you can
see here in the shadows on the truck or
like under the shadows of the trees and
the whites were really bright it was
really noticeable when a light moved
from one zone into another one in the
full array back light on the smaller
display not so much it is a lot harder
to pick up on well there's a little bit
of Kate just go away
well there's a little bit of halo it's
not bad like you see that so I got to
tell you guys first impressions very
impress is it worth the money well given
that we don't know the price yet and
given that we don't have the final
hardware yet we're gonna have to reserve
judgment for the full review which will
be coming but it is looking very very
promising
