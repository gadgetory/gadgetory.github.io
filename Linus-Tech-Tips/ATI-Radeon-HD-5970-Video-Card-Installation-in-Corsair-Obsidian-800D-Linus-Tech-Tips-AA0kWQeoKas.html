follow-up to our 5970 unboxing on just
how big this card is and what it's going
to take to get it to fit in your case so
one case that I had on hand here I built
that I've been working on and his torn
apart right now I apologize for the
state of it this is the Corsair obsidian
800 D case though and I just wanted to
show for scale the kind of monster case
that you need to fit one or heaven
forbid even two of these video cards so
we're installing it in our PCI Express
slot here and there's a couple things I
want you to note about this first of all
how much overhang there is from a
standard sized ATX board you're pretty
much going to need a case that supports
EI TX or has a lot of clearance past the
edge of the motherboard if you want this
card to fit another thing to note is
that it's very important to choose a
motherboard that has right angle SATA
slots because you can see there's two
two and two of the SATA support SATA
ports on this motherboard are actually
directly under the video card we can
access them if they were right angle
then we'd be able to plug them in from
the side even under the video card now
the last thing I wanted to kind of show
you just for perspective here is a
couple generations ago this was a
reasonably high end card this is a 38 50
okay so for for size comparison that's
what it looks like compared to the 59 70
just ridiculous so oh actually one more
thing you want to be very careful with
your system once you've got this
installed so you put in your two screws
but you got to think about this the only
thing supporting this card is your PCI
Express slot and two screws over here
you want to be careful not to jar your
system or ship your system potentially
unless you've done everything you can to
secure this card in place because it can
put a lot of strain on your PCI Express
slot thank you for checking out my
installation video for the Radeon 59 70</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
