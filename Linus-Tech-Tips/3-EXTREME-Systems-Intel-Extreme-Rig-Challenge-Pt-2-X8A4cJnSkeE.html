competition where system builders work
to create the most extreme gaming rig
utilizing intel's unlocked 7th
generation Core i7 processor and their
600 C SSD Intel asked us to visit and
check out six of the final systems that
you guys voted for the fact that we're
actually in the top seven is something
very exciting to me anyone who goes to
pax
see who either power is show what we're
capable of allows me to kind of explain
what can we do with our system right any
extreme rig that is being built is is I
wouldn't say over the top of it it's
more than what we would usually build as
a production system so one of the things
that makes either power different
compared to other system integrators is
the fact that we design our cases from
the ground up we want to add new things
to when we're building a system anybody
can take a component and put in a PC and
sell it the desire that I want for our
pcs when I leave this production
facility is if it's something that I
would want myself right if if I see that
PC getting boxed and being shipped and I
look at it and I say and I I want that
PC on my desk that's how I want every
single kid to feel when we're building a
system and shipping it out I want to
make sure that everything when it was
tested everything went perfect and it
looks the way that every customer chose
and wanted to be and I want to make sure
we give that to our customers to their
expectations we want to meet their
expectations about that I think a lot of
us system builders all feel very similar
like we all have a lot of the same thing
you know passion for beautiful computers
you know that that when you were young
and wanting your first awesome computer
putting in your custom fans and LEDs and
cathodes and UV everything you know I
think what really drives us is that
you know zai tax is a custom boutique
with great prices and an incredible
warranty our lifetime warranty you know
some people think it's crazy but I mean
we we do it so what is my desire for
every PC that leaves our facility I mean
it's the wow factor it's that incredible
moment you get when you get the system
you turn it on and your joy and your
happiness
so one of the great things about doing
this competition is ability to be
creative we could do some really awesome
over-the-top ten twenty thousand dollar
computer cut open the case we love RGB
LEDs in fact they almost get overused
nowadays like everybody RGB this RGB
that I mean you can get toilet bowl
rings that have our TV's on them so easy
to get really flashy cool looking things
that we still made it really really
beautiful and really eye-catching but
without you know going too far off the
deep end you know you know at CyberPower
PC our mission is to make gaming a part
of everyday life in every household and
what we mean by that is we want it to
become a part of the culture and we're
already seeing that and CyberPower is
doing everything we can to make sure
that that dream comes true so that when
we deliver a product that's stable and
high performers we know it's going to
last you so that shared experience of
gaming between the family between
parents and kids can last for many years
what excites me about participating is
extremely challenged every year is that
we get to build a great system and it's
not a system that we don't get to do
often it's a system that we build
systems that just amaze people and have
the greatest hardware and build that you
could ever see which means it has the
top-of-the-line hardware and it's using
a case that's pretty limited and unique
in Wendie frame 2.0 which is a really
limited run case and when we're building
the extreme break it allows us to
explore things we normally wouldn't do
like in this case it was the first time
we got to try copper tubing and we're
really successful and then in fact from
learning from the extreme rate we were
able to implement into our regular
production so the extreme rig every year
gives us such
to really explore something different
you know something beyond what we
normally would do and sometimes we come
up with something really amazing the
winner will be announced at PAX East and
there's still time to get out there and
vote each vote enters you for a chance
to win one of these systems so go now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
