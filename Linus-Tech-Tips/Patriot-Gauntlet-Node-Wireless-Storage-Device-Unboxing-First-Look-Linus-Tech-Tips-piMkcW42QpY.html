the gauntlet note from patriot this is
an cameraman okay cameraman insists that
I tell you guys that he did not
understand what this product did based
on the packaging and I sort of actually
see his point so it streams wireless
music videos and pictures um
tablet-friendly up to two terabyte drive
not included Google Play available on
the App Store unless until you get down
to sort of the finer sort of details
here up to eight simultaneous mobile
devices tablet friendly up to two
terabyte hard drive drive on the food
okay these are all the same things we've
seen already um okay I kind of see
camera man's point however maybe when we
get to the back we will understand more
like more better the gauntlet note
offers seamless integration with tablets
and other popular mobile devices for a
truly superior portable storage solution
aha portable storage for your tablet or
your phone or other mobile device with
the ability to connect up to eight
devices at a time and apps support for
iOS Android and kindle fire and plug and
play compatibility with windows these
operating systems the gauntlet node
provides an extremely robust and easy to
use personal cloud for immediate access
to stored media and data with a built-in
battery the gamla node will support up
to 5.5 hours of continuous streaming for
the ultimate entertainment solution on
the go Wi-Fi n 150 megabit per second
weapon wpa-psk security is supported non
replaceable battery up to 5.5 hours of
continuous streaming so what is this
thing this is basically like a free
agent goflex satellite except that you
don't actually have to buy a freeagent
goflex satellite it's also like
Kingston's Y Drive so what you do is you
don't get all your accessories and
doodads and whatnot going on here got
all your components and you take your
two and a half inch drive which is here
you install it in here you use a USB
connection to drop whatever data you
want onto the drive
out there okay I'll to USB 3 0 go
awesome that's way better than the
freeagent goflex actually that one's USB
2 which makes it like slow and
inconvenient to actually load things on
it so it comes a hold on see how does
this work oh there we go oh that was
easy it's just a sliding thing okay so
you throw your drive in here you install
your drive all the the batteries do the
battery you can feel where the battery
is because it weighs a lot on this side
batteries here wireless chipsets and all
that are their data connections here you
got your app power USB connection so
that's how you charge it and goes in
there like that also got up just a
dedicated power in i guess that might
also charge it I don't know something
probably charge is it comes with an
adapter for USB so you got okay it looks
like you can you know what when we just
find out how to charge this thing
alright so we figured it out you're
Asian powered devices AC adapter which
you can unplug like that plugs in by USB
to either the dedicated charging port or
the USB 3 port and it will charge it
either way so don't worry too much about
it in fact it's mind-boggling to me that
they even bothered to include a DC in
but yeah I mean I guess sigh if you're
transferring data from your notebook and
you don't want to power the drive off
your notebook and then you plug this
into the wall next to your notebook but
then that's not a very mobile solution
if you're using a notebook on a battery
you probably don't have a wall charger
nearby so okay okay camera man shaking
his head at me because apparently that's
pretty far-fetched so let's go ahead and
take this apart as your power no not
power something else oh that might check
your battery up to a battery life
indicator so you got for a little LEDs
there that's kind of neat okay so there
you have it five and a half hours of
battery life we're gonna have to
actually try the app before we can
determine so wait stay tuned for our
full NCIX tech tips on this one where we
actually try it out and I think that
pretty much covers it that's the
gauntlet node from Patriot don't forget
to subscribe linus tech tip from
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos
