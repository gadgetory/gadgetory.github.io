sample an early unit of the successor to
the wildly successful crowdfunded GPD
pocket it's nice to have a crowdfunding
campaign workout once in a while so this
right here is a full-fledged quad-core
PC bat per the name fits in your pocket
or at least in my pocket I have pretty I
have pretty big pockets it's not about
the size of the pockets it's about that
man who wears the pocket doesn't matter
anyway the point is they've made a bunch
of changes both in terms of ergonomics
and performance and we are going to take
a look at it after I tell you about our
sponsor Origin PC Origin pcs Evo 15s is
only four point three pounds
features a 144 Hertz 1080p display in a
geforce gtx 1070 max q learn more about
it and origins other pcs at the link in
the video description
now the big message from GP DS reviewers
guide materials was really one about
performance because we're going from
atom course to actual full-fledged
laptop cores in the pocket to now we
only get two of them but I'm still
expecting performance to be dramatically
better because atom cores are slow but
what's even with that said my main
problem with the original pocket wasn't
actually the performance it was really
the the usability of the device starting
with IO o both of these dead gosh darnit
I will say this performance wise I mean
based on how much further along we are
in the setup process here you can see
that it definitely makes a difference
even if it wasn't something that had
stood out to me at the time so here
let's run through the physical changes
while I wait for some stuff to install
here so we've got USB type-c for
charging on the right that's the same as
before we've got a USB type a for
whatever it is that you could want to
plug into it that's the same as before
but while last time we had our headphone
jack as well as a micro HDMI on the
right side now we turn it over to the
other side and we've got no micro HDMI
although honestly given that we live in
the dongle age now Thank You Apple for
that that doesn't bother me micro HDMI
is a super fragile connector and I would
much rather have this so we've got
another full size type-a and our
headphone jack over on the other side
along with a microSD slot so if you've
got one of those amazing little
high-capacity micro SD cards like I will
hopefully be able to find extremely
quickly
here then you can add up to 512 gigs of
storage to this thing on top of the 128
gigs that it already comes with because
it should be SDXC is that gonna work
there we go
that's probably just a tooling issue on
the early units here
so speaking of tooling actually this is
a unibody construction here so you can
see this is a single piece of aluminum
all along the top here and then they're
just putting a bottom cover on it the
other big change from a usability
perspective is the keyboard and mouse
now okay my initial reaction was that I
was pretty upset that they had done away
with the nipple nose because while the
nipple mouse isn't my favorite it's sort
of making the best of a bad situation
where you've got very little space to
work with and once you get good with it
you can get pretty good and what they
replaced it was is this little what it
is is okay you know normally the way a
mouse works is you've got an optical
sensor in it and then you move it around
on a surface the way this works is we've
got a stationary optical sensor under
this little square right here and then
you move a textured surface which I
guess would be your finger in this case
over top of it so what you end up doing
is you end up needing quite a few
motions in order to move all the way
across the screen now what I also
couldn't figure out at first was how to
drag things because initially I thought
as soon as I run out of finger runway
that's as far as I can drag things
because when you go to the edge it
doesn't keep going like it would on a
trackpad or on a nipple but fortunately
they actually did think of this if you
use your thumb a it doesn't require
quite as many swipes just because you've
got a larger surface here and B you've
actually got left and right clicks here
that are built into the top left corner
of the device so if you can you can
click and you can drag something to your
heart's content
just like that so you end up with this
kind of like game controller style
ergonomics to it that works really
well especially when you consider how
much better of a keyboard experience
you're getting this drove me nuts the
fact that here like look at this look at
this from an angle here the fact that
this spacebar was so hard to press
without interfering with the left click
or bumping your thumb on the bottom of
the chassis here so it's pretty short
which means it's not natural to hit with
your left thumb you got to kind of reach
for it all right
period and question mark are in very
unusual locations I do appreciate the
full-size arrow keys this time around
you can kind of see some of the gaming
DNA of GPD that's actually short for
gamepad digital with that some games do
like a nice full-size arrow key so I'm
glad to see that but the one huge sin
that I wish they had changed as I wish
it had to shift keys with that said
compared to these key clusters like this
and you know putting stuff like this
over here this is something that I could
at least eventually get used to they've
done away with useless stuff like caps
lock stuff you really don't need on a
highly mobile experience like this one
now I want to take a look at performance
so now they don't intend for this to be
a gaming machine but of course we're
gonna try it so while we wait for that
to load up though let's talk about what
we might expect and what kind of specs
are in here because it wasn't that long
ago
then it wasn't even realistic to build
an entire computer in this kind of a
form factor at all and we've gone from
there to now this guy actually having
very similar specs to the new Microsoft
Surface go all right so this gives us a
good look at things in here so right
there
that's our core m37 Y 30 CPU so that's
dual cores at one to two gigahertz and
change but what's important about those
course is that those are actually
Haswell course so this is the same type
of course that gets used in a normal
notebook or even a desktop machine
seventh gen course then right next to it
here we've got four gigs of ram although
it's available with up to eight
gigs then we've got 128 gigs of storage
I'm pretty sure that's that then we've
got a cooling fan here that's just got a
single radiator and a single heat pipe
right there and then we've got a pretty
decent size 3,400 milliamp hour battery
and that's pretty much it for the
internals I guess I never mentioned
right this is an H IPS 1280 did I say
1280 sorry I mean 1900 by 1200 display
pretty darn good of these frame rates
like so we're running at 1280 by 720
Lowe in Terminator but given that no one
probably expected to be running triple-a
games even older ones on a machine like
this I would actually say the I call
this like probably 10 to 15 FPS that
we're getting right now it's pretty darn
impressive I mean you'll be able to
easily play games like you know retro
games like Age of Empires 2 HD or
whatever the case may be on something
like this now this is cool so the fan
can actually make I'd say a fair bit of
noise it's definitely audible but what's
neat is that if you want it to not turbo
up they've actually got a dedicated
button to turn the fan off and go into a
low-power silent mode although I
wouldn't expect to be running any games
with it like that got it got it
alright so to have a look at the
performance improvements we've got the
original pocket we've got the pocket 2
and then for the sake of completeness
we've got the Pentium 44 15y equipped
surface go higher base clock but no
boost so problem is that especially with
these low-power machines it's hard to
find a chance to benchmark them because
this one's got 60% of its CPU being
sucked up by dism hosts servicing
process desktop with anti-malware
service executed just like random
windows crap that's running in the
background 80 percent 87 Microsoft this
is your
computer why you do this 90% so far
Cinebench friend we've got the original
pocket the pocket 2 with the n7 y 30 cpu
and then we've got the Pentium 44 15 why
in the surface go so let's go ahead and
start them all oh yeah I guess they all
have touch screens so I could just boom
boop boop
oh that one's started wait what what is
going on here oh wow that one took that
long just to start so you'll notice here
that it still got four boxes that's
because this is a hyper threaded
processor and it is just creaming for
true cores over here so turbo boost is
giving us a clear advantage even though
it's base clock is lower its turbo
hang-up higher than the surface go oh it
also has a lot more level three cache 4
Meg's versus 2 Meg's so the performance
story is looking pretty good here at 177
I mean that's still not earth-shattering
performance this is still slower than
like a Core 2 quad q6600 from literally
10 years ago but that's 10% faster than
the surface go at 160 and whatever that
works out to a lot a lot a lot faster
than 124 the old pocket and the
remarkable thing is that yeah even
though it's slower than a desktop CPU
from 10 years ago
that's a desktop CPU this literally fits
in your pocket oh it should be noted
they're changing some of the buttons
though so this is gonna be tab and these
are all kind of moving around it's for
the better though it's for the better
and now Linus won't watch his favorite
youtuber like the speakers on this thing
not amazing and I use the term speakers
loosely because there's only one and it
actually fires up through the the holes
around the the keys so it doesn't yeah
it doesn't sound that great but we can
playback 1080p videos and
suck back about 11 to 13 percent of the
CPU that is not too shabby
max screen brightness is not bad either
like I wouldn't want to be watching in
direct sunlight or anything but it's
very comfortable even under direct
overhead lighting here you know what all
this talk of decent performance actually
gets me thinking while GPB according to
their marketing anyway might envision
their user has like you know dainty
ladies and coffee shops I see it has
more of like like a power user on the go
where you might want to have the the
flexibility to either have something
super portable I'll be it with limited
functionality or the ability to use the
device as like a mobile almost desktop
experience so let's try that we've got a
Type C dongle with a power in on the one
side here we've got now player teather
neck and let's get Photoshop installed
see how usable this is the
world-renowned Photoshop expert Hensel
was called to work on a rare
one-of-a-kind Linus tech tips thumbnail
hold on I think I still have silent mode
on oh okay well hold on was it slow yeah
yeah okay so like every time I select a
thing it does the waiting thing I don't
mean I've ever had that happen before
okay but like it's the RAM like
yeah we've only got four gigs there is
an 8 gig model though pixel art that's
amazing
okay so some reason I think it's not a
great system to use on its own like if
you have other options yeah but this
actually reminds me of that time when
you asked me to edit a thumbnail and all
I had was my phone and I remote it in
and edited a thumbnail on my phone right
this would be better than this would be
way better than thinking around on my
phone okay so it's not perfect and there
are definitely still some compromises
that you're making when you have a
machine that is small enough to fit in
your pocket but for the price that
they're asking which is actually really
similar to the surface go for more
performance and a keyboard that again
isn't perfect but is included it looks
pretty darn good and I think they're
gonna have another successful
crowdfunding campaign on their hands
here speaking of successful private
Internet access is the way to be
successfully protected on the internet P
ia has clients available for Windows Mac
Linux Chrome they've got like more
coming in the future
and it's the VPN that hides your true
identity behind a protected fake IP
address allowing you to get behind
censorship and enjoy content that is
otherwise going to be geo blocked like
if you want to watch the BBC from
somewhere else you can even use a VPN
like P ia to save money on flights you
can check out the video that we're gonna
have coming about that very very soon
and if you want to hook yourself up with
P ia today check them out at the link in
the video description they've got over a
thousand servers in 28 countries giving
them fantastic coverage regardless of
where you want to appear as though you
are using the internet from so thanks
