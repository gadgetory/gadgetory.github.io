compare the reference cooler for the GTX
560 and I realize I'm holding entirely
the wrong prop right now but the
reference cooler for the GTX 560 so this
is a flower style heat pipe cooler so
you can see if I guess if I spin that
you may be able to see a little bit
better you can see it looks kind of like
a stock Intel LGA 1155 heatsink and then
there's three heat pipes that come out
of the top can you see in there okay
what if I print like this can you see
the heat pipes no okay how about now can
you see the heat pipes through the top
really you get to the heat pipes okay
one two three heat pipes like that so
those are spreading out into a like thin
arrangement on either side so it's
actually kind of like the msi cyclone
cooler InDesign but it's covered with a
shroud now some of the exhaust is going
to come out here someone is gonna come
out here some of it's gonna come out
here and someone's gonna come out of
here so while it does have a rear
exhaust vent for all intents and
purposes we can consider this a sort of
70 to 80 percent internal exhaust part
now I wanted to compare that to the msi
gtx 560 Twin Frozr 2 now this is not
that card this is a GTX 460 hawk the
Twin Frozr 2 card is actually on the
test bench right now preparing for my
idle temperature measurement but I'm
going to compare both temperatures and
noise levels of the twin frozer to
heatsink which looks like this now this
is an almost entirely internal exhaust
heat sink as well you can see we're
going to get some incidental airflow
from this fan coming out here but other
than that there's a lot exhaust coming
right through the card here and the gaps
right through here there's going to be
some going out this way the heat pipes
including two super pipes that is
thicker than standard heat pipes and two
normal ones so there are four total heat
pipes are part of the overall design it
does use a dense vent arrangement with
dual fans in order to achieve what msi
claims is up to 20 degrees better cool
underload than a stock cooler now it's
become a little bit challenging with
recent GPUs to measure maximum load so
instead of using fir mark which was my
traditional favorite because of the way
they've locked them down to actually
underperform in fur marks so that you
don't blow out your GPU by benchmarking
firm are called a which I can kind of
understand what I'm actually going to do
is I'm going to loop the heav'n
benchmark and then just find the highest
temperature recorded during the entire
thing this will be lower than normal so
probably the Delta will be lower than
we'd normally see but I guess it will
give us some more realistic look at what
the kind of noise and what kind of
temperatures we're gonna get with these
cards in in gaming scenarios so right
now I'll show you guys my testing
methodology I've got the GTX 560 on an
open bench bear in mind open bench is
going to be up to five to even ten
degrees cooler than what you're gonna
see in a closed case either that or the
fan will ramp up more so it will also be
in some ways quieter now I've got my
ambient temperature here which is about
23 degrees and I have a temperature
probe right here in front of the fan
intake so based on a 23 degree intake
temperature and a 27 degree idle
temperature on my card I will call that
a delta of 4 degrees for my gtx 560 so
i'm going to do some low temps that i'm
going to do some testing on the
reference design and then i'll come back
and do a conclusion for you guys not to
stress the card as much as possible i am
running the tessellation on extreme as
well as a tax AAA and no it's not
counterfeit I just changed my Hardware
all the time a 8 X 8 a &amp;amp; 16 x AF
otherwise looks like this now in terms
of temperatures hold on I'm gonna turn
my sensor back on so the room temps have
gone up a little bit because I did have
the doors closed so we're at 26 degrees
in the room now and the maximum I'm
going to take the absolute peak maximum
we saw during the heaven benchmark was
54 degrees so that was the highest that
was seen
so then that means 54 minus 26 is I'm
not very good at mental math so I'll be
recording that on a graph and then I'll
show you guys the reference cooler in a
moment
okay so just getting an idle temperature
reading from my reference card so we're
gonna call that 23 degrees ambient and
we'll call that in a complete inability
of my camera to focus on anything well
I'll tell you what it says then it says
28 so there is the reference card on the
bench and there is another attempt to
focus collecting I can look them up on
yeah you can kind of see that 28 so
that's a delta of only about 5 degrees
so back with the load results so we can
see here on the graph what our max
temperatures were while running the
heav'n benchmark
we peaked at around 70 degrees so that
is a delta of actually well here I'll do
the math okay because our room
temperature is no 23 actually it was 20
for a moment ago but I opened the door
so we're gonna go with 24 either way
here is the data I'm not gonna bother
graphing this for you guys I'm sorry so
with the hawk we had a four degree Delta
from the room temperature up to the
temperature of the GPU at idle so a 5
degree Delta on the reference card but
then when we look at the low
temperatures it is almost as advertised
on the msi box almost a 20 degree
difference between the 4 5 60 Twin Frozr
2 and the 5 60 reference card so you can
see that MSI does advertise 20 degrees
Celsius cooler now if we were running a
more extreme scenario we probably might
see 20 degrees as a worst case scenario
something else to bear in mind is this
is an OC addition card so naturally the
Twin Frozr 2 card will run a little bit
hotter so if we clocked it down to the
same speeds as the reference card we
might actually see even better
temperatures so thank you for checking
out my video the GeForce GTX 560 TI
thermals and acoustics as well as the
person between the reference card and
the Twin Frozr to addition card from NSI
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos
so this is my noise reading for the gtx
560 TI Twin Frozr 2 and it will about 6
inches from the fan and let you guys
take a little listen and then I'm going
to cut in the reference cooler
and here's my load test on the Twin
Frozr - so I'm just going to move my
normal distance from the car and I'll
cut in with the reference cooler
