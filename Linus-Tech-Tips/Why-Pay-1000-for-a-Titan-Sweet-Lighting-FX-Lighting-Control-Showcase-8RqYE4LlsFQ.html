Corsair Vengeance k70 and k95 these
fully mechanical keyboards are designed
for performance gaming visit Corsair
calm / vengeance gaming to learn more
welcome to a cool little video where we
cover what you get for spending more on
a geforce gtx graphics card ok sure you
get more performance you know but more
performance more memory these are all
good things but what you actually get if
you go for a gtx 670 is you get an
extremely stylish geforce gtx logo
printed on the side of the plastic
shroud of your video card all right what
do you get for stepping up to a gtx 680
well you get a glossy plastic shroud and
a textured geforce logo that really pops
out of the side now if you drop a
thousand dollars on a GTX Titan or gtx
690 you get a glowing logo on the side
of your aluminum shroud graphics card I
mean you also get six gigs of RAM on the
Titan which in this case is what we have
but now is the but wait there's more
moment because with the EVGA LED
controller this was actually released a
while ago we've been meaning to do a
blog video about it for a bit here you
can now control the LED on the card so
here stay here and i'm going to show you
all the different modes so in manual
control you just drag the slider and the
illumination changes in frame rate per
second control it goes up with higher
FPS and down with lower with GPU clock
it raises with your boost clock and
lowers with your not boost clock with
LED breathing you can control the timing
of the breaths anywhere from 10
milliseconds all the way up to 5 500
milliseconds so half of a second and
then you can do GP utilization which
goes up with GP utilization and down
with not GP utilization ok so go and
check out the card check out the card
guys is pretty cool so I'm in manual
control mode now I've got it all the way
off I'm going to go ahead i'm going to
show you guys kind of 25% here's fifty
percent here's seventy-five percent and
a hundred percent is extremely vibrant
extremely bright next down we've got
frame rate per second so we're not going
to show you that one just this at this
moment LED breathing here's a fast
breathe so this is a ten millisecond
ok now I'm going to show you guys a bit
of a slower breathe so this is about a
hundred milliseconds and the LED
controller utility runs in the system
tray you can set it to apply it start up
I really wish that they would have
integrated this with EVGA precision
rather than having a dedicated tool for
it but you know it is what it is and
then keep utilization and we're back to
manual control so here let's go ahead
and try GPU utilization and so we're set
to that and I'm going to launch a game
so you can see right now it's quite dim
so I'm firing up crisis here and that
should in theory brighten up let's see
if we can like shoot some explosive
arrows and whatnot and see if that does
anything oh there we go yeah it's
brightening very cool so thank you for
checking out this sort of you know small
blog video on Linus tech tips don't
forget to subscribe for more unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and I
know why you have so much trouble with
that turret all the time can't you just
take it out with the gun oh ok now I'm
understanding we're going to leave now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
