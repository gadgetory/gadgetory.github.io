screens or her dual screens very very
much I know this for a fact
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys
this notebook is great it's fantastic it
is not a dual-screen notebook that is
not how that works however products like
this allow you to take your notebook and
have a second monitor and they have
evolved in such a way that at this time
you can get the MB one six eight B well
not yet but you'll be able to get it
soon from a Seuss that allows you to
both power and transmit all the display
information from a single super speed
USB 3 port so right there
one cable everything you need you can
control the brightness right here and
the power right here and there are a
couple of features that are included
with the retail shipping model of this
but are not actually functional yet on
this evaluation sample so number one is
it's going to have Auto detecting rotate
so you can switch it to portrait mode if
you want and the other thing guys is
it's going to have an ambient light
sensor so you can help save on power
because it is being powered off your
presumably notebook battery the other
cool thing about this is it weighs less
than a kilogram I think was the was the
spec note see the PM told me this but
it's not on here
either way it's so light that I can hold
it in to fit well okay it's still kind
of fragile because it's an engineering
sample product but in terms of the
actual weight of it I can hold it like
that comfortably it weighs almost
nothing and it is extremely slim so that
makes it again perfect for travel it
comes with a carry case as well so you
can go ahead and stuff it in there nice
softly padded folds over like that no
magnetic which is good something I
didn't know yet and look at this you can
put it up at two different angles
however you want so you can either prop
it up in there for a more vertical
viewing experience or you can put it
down here to have it lie down a little
bit more flat which might be more
natural to go along with your notebooks
display so don't forget to check out the
rest of our CES 2013 coverage and be
subscribe to Linus tech tips because we
going to have lots of videos about all
the cool stuff here at the show thanks
