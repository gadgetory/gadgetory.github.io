optimized for silent operation click now
to learn more welcome to my review of
the manliest video card that we've ever
seen ok no but seriously the brand is
called manly na NL I not with a y at the
end I'd never heard of them before
either so as soon as you guys if if you
guys hear me like modest I've never
heard of this before don't worry you're
not the only one but this right here is
their ultimate class GeForce GTX 770 so
just like any other gtx 770 you've got
support for GPU boost a 2.0 you've got
wicked fast 7 gigahertz gddr5 memory
this particular one happens to have 4
gigs of gddr5 memory which definitely
gives it an advantage over other gtx 770
s particularly when running at higher
resolutions you've got support for
physics you got support for 3d vision
the new geforce experience which
basically optimizes your game settings
downloads latest drivers for you all
without much user intervention at all
other than installing it in the first
place and of course the extremely
exciting upcoming Nvidia shadowplay
which will allow you to record your
gameplay videos on the fly and just grab
only the ones that you want although
sorry that's not actually quite released
yet but it should come at some point ok
so how does a graphics card manufacturer
differentiate from the others ok so
number one is they can add more RAM
Manly has done that here this is a four
gig card number two is they can
overclock the card ok so Manley has done
that here as well however around here we
believe in manual overclocking anyway so
we don't care too much about the clock
speeds that cards ship at but what we do
care about particularly on GPU boost 2.0
cards which rely on the temperature of
the graphics card in order to keep the
clocks high we do care about cooling so
they can put better coolers on them the
cooler on this card not only uses a
couple of 92 millimeter fans but they
also have a little bit more depth to
them than some of the fans that you find
on graphics cards and they don't whine
or tick whether they're running at high
speed or low speed so we did observe
that they are they're actually quite
quite excellent fans
now you can also make esthetic tweaks or
cable management tweaks so it uses the
stacked PCI Express connector design
that we were familiarized with on the
gtx 680 as opposed to the side-by-side
one that we find on most 770's and uses
a metal shroud around the cooler rather
than a plastic strap which you do find
on some cards it also has five heat
pipes carrying heat all around the card
so you can actually see the copper heat
pipes through the top of the shroud here
it uses a standard PCI Express 3.0 16 X
interface down here it has two sli
connectors so it supports two a
three-way and four-way SLI little
four-way SLI really isn't recommended it
has two dual link DVI ports as well as
an HDMI port and a display port port and
what's this is that a gold blingtastic
accent on the cart that looks fantastic
I actually love it it would go perfectly
with my old audigy 2zs which also had a
gold backplate which I also loved on the
back of the card we find ah so it's it's
almost as if they mated this like the
Linus Edition card between the gold
accents and that gorgeous matte black
PCB that has like no shine to it at all
that looks fantastic and then you can
also see of course the extra memory
modules on the back which should be what
I'm interested in but I'm all about dead
matte black PCB that looks fantastic so
it requires a six pin and an eight pin
PCI Express connector I don't think I
mentioned that even when I was showing
you the stack design and it is quite a
long card now another way that they can
differentiate is in terms of warranty
support and or product quality so check
this out guys Manley is offering a three
year warranty which is pretty good it's
above average and then they're also
offering this is interesting a 24 hour
testing guarantee so that means every
card gets burned in for 24 hours this is
kind of similar to what MSI is doing on
their OC certified so things like their
empower boards where they're actually
burning them in prior to shipping which
should pretty much negate the
possibility of having a defective card
although anything can happen in shipping
trust me guys so without further ado
let's get into the performance numbers
is it better than a reference card yeah
actually we found it did perform a
little bit better than a referee
card we don't know if this is entirely
due to being running at slightly higher
clock speeds because we were able to
achieve slightly higher clock speeds or
whether it was due to the GPU being able
to run at higher clock speeds because of
the better cooler design now with that
said better should have an asterisk here
because I love the cooler design on the
stock 770 it looks so good but it
doesn't remove heat from the GPU quite
as well should be noted that blower
design removes heat from the case a
little bit better whereas this one will
exhaust air into your case but at any
rate yes
in our small cross-section of games we
did get better performance with Manley's
ultimate card I should also probably
show you the accessories it comes with
it comes with a completely useless
driver installation DVD you should run
the latest drivers off the nvidia
website as well as probably a QuickStart
guide who cares
DVI to VGA adapter and then two adapters
dual molex to 6-pin and dual 6 pin to
eight pin however my usual thing on all
this is if you're using a VGA adapter or
power supply adapters you should
probably think about upgrading your
monitor and/or your power supply to go
with your wicked new card so thank you
