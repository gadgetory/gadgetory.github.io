product from fractal design this is
their Newton r2 800 watt power supply so
we had a look at the test levy on a day
which is according to them a very
similar platform but the big difference
is that the Newton is modular ok there
are a couple other key differences
they're both a B+ but the Newton also
includes a 135 millimeter fan instead of
a 120 millimeter fan so let's have a
look at what it says about itself on the
Box first of all they have a chart here
that gauges the noise level versus the
wattage of power output so they're
saying it stays under 30 decibels even
if you're going up to 800 watts of power
but you can see the sweet spot is in the
350 to 400 watt range like most power
supplies you get the quietest most
efficient operation at about half of the
rated output ok attached cables and
modular cables we'll get into those when
we open it up so I'm not going to worry
too much about that we've got a picture
of it it's an award-winning series with
a focus on high power output and low
noise level that seems to be what
fractal design is all about in general
another key difference with the Newton
series is that we're looking at a single
12 volt rail so that's a 60 amp 12 volt
rail capable of providing up to about
720 watts of power now I do like to see
power supplies that can provide at or
near their entire rated output on the 12
volt rail because systems are so 12-volt
heavy these days that that's really the
most important one but I mean you gotta
not everyone's going to be expecting
their power supplies out the same way
and you gotta accept that so let's get
this open okay check this out I have a
knife today yes success okay we have a
user's manual the user's manual is in
probably six different languages like
there are other user's manuals including
Swedish because that's where the company
is based so it talks about the warranty
a little bit gives you the specs
introduction to the company and tells
you how to install it great thank you
for that next we have a couple of velcro
cable ties as well as four screws for
installing at the back of the case now
these are longer than normal screws and
I discovered why that is yesterday
because the fractal design r2 case
actually has padding at the back near
the power supply for noise deadening so
that's why the screws have to be a
little bit longer to reach through that
padding so then we have a european-style
power cord which I'm assuming the North
American models will ship with a North
American level plug but this is this is
just a sample so I'm guessing that that
didn't happen so much do not eat this
thank you
that is all piece of foam don't eat that
either decorational bag
do not eat oh sorry I'm sorry the jokes
old now I know let's have a look at the
power supply first and then we'll look
at the modular cables that are included
with it so it comes in a nice little
fractal design bag that has the string
wrapped 352 million times around the
power cord so I'll have to detangle that
somehow before I can open it there we go
very clean modular interface on this
unit I really like that all of the
modular cables look like they are the
same and I can't see if it's labeled
right it wouldn't be labeled which rail
they're running off of because there is
a single 12 volt rail so my dad you know
what they're there okay fractal designs
has figured out some things that it
seems to take other companies way too
long to figure out there are two
attached cables and that is it there's a
20+4 pin so a 24-pin ATX connector and
then there is a four plus four eight pin
p4 connector that's it you see so many
fully modular power supplies that have a
24 pin a 4 pin and a separate 8 pin how
many motherboards take a 4 pin and an 8
pin very few very few although there are
some that do so give them that ok let's
have a look at the overall finish to
this unit it's a matte black fairly
fingerprint resistant based on my quick
test here where I basically put my
finger on it and see if it leaves a
print at the back we've got a standard
honeycomb sort of a mesh on/off switch
as well as the power plug receptacle
there here we list the specs again which
we already had a fairly close look at
but it also says something about
warranty void if the seal and label is
broken so be careful of that on the top
you've got that it passed all of its
tests that's really good if you don't
see those stickers maybe uh maybe return
it
and then on the bottom we find a hundred
and thirty five-millimeter fans so there
you go past warranty boy different moves
okay let's have a look at all of the
cables that we can plug into this
modular interface so they allow us to
plug ten additional cables into this guy
so let's get started here in the first
pouch we have two six plus two pin PCI
Express okay oh no we have three that's
kind of random three six plus two pin
okay hopefully there will be another one
later because I can't think of any
configuration that would need three
except maybe no okay yeah no I can't
think of anything there it is
another six plus two cable there you go
so you can plug in up to four six pin or
eight pin PCI Express plugs next we have
two molex actually we've got more you
know what I'm just gonna take all of
these out so that I can talk about them
all at the same time there we go that
would be more efficient right okay so
let's get all the molex ones together
here so we have three molex plugs that
we could potentially use one of them has
four molex connectors on it
one of them has another four molex
connectors on it
and another one has two molex connectors
and one floppy connector okay and then
next we have SATA and this seems like a
bit of a deficiency I don't know that's
not too bad I thought it was only only
2x3 but it's actually 2 by 4 so you can
plug in eight SATA devices and you can
see these cables are nice and long I
mean can you imagine a power that's
actually that tall to your optical drive
at the top very few okay maybe there is
one but I kind of I kind of done it and
actually that's another thing I wanted
to point out you can see that the cables
for the 8 pin here is also very long and
there's a reason for that there are two
case actually has a bottom mounted power
supply so they've accounted for you to
have to route it up behind the
motherboard tray and then bring it
around to where the normal a pin or 4
pin connector would be on your
motherboard thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the Newton 800 watt
modular power supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
