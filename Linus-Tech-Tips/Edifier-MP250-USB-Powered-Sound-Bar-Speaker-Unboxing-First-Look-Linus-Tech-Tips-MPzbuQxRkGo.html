a product from a Neda fire now I
actually I think the last time I unboxed
an Edifier product was about a year ago
when when I did my Christmas present for
Esther who also works at NCIX you can
check her out on Facebook and this one
is also because when my fellow employees
here at NCIX is interested in buying one
and wants to see it so I figured well if
we're gonna open it up I might as well
do YouTube about it this is the MP 250
portable speaker USB sound bar so here
is that same information in a variety of
other languages alright so we'll flip it
over to the back and I'm going in cold
on this one as per my usual arrangement
so we're gonna discover it together it
has integrated volume control there's
your USB input as well as an auxiliary
input we have in terms of features it is
powered by USB
okay so powered by USB I guess that it
does not actually take an audio signal
from USB so that's what that that input
jack there is for it's a two-channel
stereo speaker with two 1.25 inch
drivers okay on each channel interesting
okay elaborately designed bass reflex
for three-and-a-half millimeter
auxiliary input speaker must be
connected to USB port for power it
includes a soft carry pouch and USB
cable alright that is in four languages
and then we've got these specifications
which I'll just let the cameraman have a
look at really quickly here just make
sure it focuses so they can read it and
positive they feel like it and if they
don't then who cares okay there we are
let's open it up and have a look at what
we got so it's covered by a 2-year
warranty from Edifier oh and it has a
sticker on it that we're going to have
to break the seal on there so now it's
open
find out what's inside there's the sound
bar itself we've got some documentation
here let's just close that night put
that away and oh oh cameraman wants
another shot at that specification I bet
if you don't get so close and just zoom
in a bit it'll actually focus a little
better it's not a great camera for
focusing up close whatever it HD I'm
sure they can read it Lucy oh yeah it
won't focus at all right okay well we
give up all right so what do we got here
we have some like I said some
documentation we have instructions for
Mac users look at that Mac so do this if
you're a Mac user all right sound bar
USB multimedia speaker so this is your
general specifications Hey look at that
they even half a page dedicated to
unboxing outstanding that's what we're
doing today and then insulation as well
as illustrations setting up okay cool
and then we have the sound bar itself so
let's take this out it comes packed in
its little velvety carrying case thing
which you can clean some of the
cardboard residue off and then it looks
quite nice and then let's do the
accessories first in terms of
accessories we have one USB key I'm not
even gonna actually yeah I can get at
that okay we have one USB cable and one
auxiliary cable just like that quite
simple quite simple indeed let's take it
out and have a look at the sound bar
itself so as I've come to expect from
Edifier it's built way better than the
price would indicate so you can see the
two speakers for each channel as well as
what appears to be the lake mob the
subwoofer that would be the bass driver
right there in the middle so there's
actually a total of five speakers which
is pretty impressive and it's got a fair
bit of weight to it the the housing
seems to be made out of an aluminum so
you can tell by how cold it is and also
the fact that it is very obviously made
of metal here's the volume control which
is
well yeah look at that so you press it
in and then you can turn oh okay you
don't have to press it in you can just
turn it okay so there's your volume
control on the one side and then on the
other side there's the input as well as
the power all right and then it has
little rubber feet on the bottom so it's
not gonna slip around so if you're
carrying it around and you want to set
it up with your laptop or set it up on
your desktop at work or whatever it's
not gonna slide around a fair bit of
pressure on that it's not gonna move
and there's what it'll look like set up
on your desk so all you got to do is
plug this guy in and then this guy in
for powered and that's pretty much all
there is to it
thank you for checking out my unboxing

things like this and other stuff well we
figured out why I wouldn't focus
cameraman accidentally press the manual
focus button so there are these
specifications for you your viewing and
reading pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
