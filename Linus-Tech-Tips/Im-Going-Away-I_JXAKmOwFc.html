it's been a while since I've done a
livestream off a cell phone because the
last couple of times that I did it I had
problems with well the YouTube app on
Android being a gigantic steaming pile
of garbage and kicking me off the stream
even though I had an excellent
connection so I grabbed the iPhone 10 R
that's been sitting in my phone charger
thing ever since I was supposed to
review it because dbrand
did send one over for me to review and
they were like hey yeah you know we
skimmed two dogs so like it'd be great
if you could mention us in your review
while I didn't review it and so I didn't
mention you but hey I've been sitting in
doubt it's a little awkward anyway so I
apologize for the kind of potato quality
event stop so I'm actually that bad
though so all right here's the situation
for the first time since I started my
journey as a full time youtuber I've had
a lot of people ask me over the years
like - you're crazy why do you guys need
so many people to make videos why do you
have the Zelda's the facility that you
build right you did why do you do all
these things and the answer is actually
pretty simple it's because instead of
just trying to build a YouTube channel
my goal since I started has been to
build a real business you know it's like
Pinocchio right and I actually I said
this a lot of times maybe you're not
stupid I want to be a real company so so
one of my goals is because I mean
obviously you guys have probably seen a
lot of the news articles videos think
all kinds of things talking about
youtuber burnout and you know for my
part like I've kind of stayed silent on
the whole thing because I don't want I
don't want there to be a perception
while there's a guy on the roof over
there just like walking around on the
roof in our complex anyway sorry sorry
sorry off-topic um you know I don't want
to
want to contribute to a perception that
I am complaining about my job because
the reality of it is that I have the
best job on the face of the earth it's
the coolest thing ever
I I love technology I love just playing
with it all day and making videos about
it for you guys I think it's so cool
that whenever we upload a video
thousands tens of thousands millions of
people watch it it's it's the most
amazing feeling ever
so I I don't I don't want to complain
about it and I don't want people to feel
like I'm complaining about it the issue
is just that when you go six years
without ever actually taking a vacation
it is pretty exhausting and to be clear
I have taken time out where I'm not
actually in the office the key
difference is that in order to do that
because I don't know if you guys have
noticed this but in the last I believe
it's been about eight years the Linus
tech tips YouTube channel has not missed
one day of upload and now there have
been situations where we didn't upload
this day but we uploaded to the next day
but on average we have never missed a
day and that's because anytime I've
tried to get out of the office in the
past I've just had to work double-time
for the week prior or the week after I
get back in order to make up for the
difference but this time this time we
are doing something well we're doing
something really risky actually because
I have a fantastic team here but I think
you guys have probably seen many
examples over the years of youtubers
trying to you know swap themselves out
on their channels in order to I don't
know save some time for themselves or I
mean really usually that's the main
reason you would do that so I have a
great team but there's a huge risk in
allowing your great team however great
they are to host videos on the channel
and
that is exactly the plan so every week
at Linus media group we make six LTT
episodes one when show so that's up to
seven and then sometimes an extra LTTE
so some of you have noticed this but on
Fridays a lot of the time there will be
a live stream or there'll be like a
sponsored video the idea is that there's
always the six that we feel are standout
and then if there's something that we're
like okay there's a sponsor obligation
for this but like people might not like
it that much we try to make that an
extra video that week so then there's so
there's my on show so that's seven then
there's two two three episodes of tech
quickie so that's nine to ten and then
there's three episodes of tech linked so
now we're up to 12 to 13 so I did bank
some tech quickie that's done that's
taken care of no one will have to deal
with that but I have challenged my team
here in their new space yeah we actually
moved there's gonna be a vlog coming
soon by the way it's kind of hilarious I
think because we actually moved so Lloyd
are our clothing designer Nick is in the
pink office no just fantastic I love
that he was so tilted Yvonne's &amp;amp; Mild
office Colton's in the little office
over there where John used to say anyway
they're all over there and then the
writing team is actually over here now
so I challenged them in our Monday
morning meeting to keep up to do six
ltte videos while I was gone
in spite of the fact that I will be
completely gone Riley what's up how's it
going so you're you I think your plan is
to actually host some of the videos
while I'm gone is that correct that's
right I've done a little bit of that
before but I'm really nervous really I
mean a little bit and these guys are
scarier these guys are the viewers yeah
oh I see okay so what's what's your
video playing long gone well I'm making
firm
paced uh-huh-huh as you can see here I
have some looking up some tips and it's
gonna be very interesting I've never
done anything like this before I think
the last time that I mixed chemicals in
a real fashion was probably grade 11 so
that's probably is gonna it's been a
while so your baby so sorry you're
making thermal paste thermal paste for a
CPU you know it goes on top of that I
know what thermal paste cooler yeah so
what control do you want to know what
I'm doing it with spoiler I'd love to
hear I'd love to hear a couple of the
concepts well obviously obviously
toothpaste is in there yeah well okay
that's what you have to do that's a
pretty famous kind of alternative
thermal paste but there are some
materials that you would think are good
but then they actually need a little bit
of modification in order to work
properly so I found a recipe for tooth
paste mixed with Vaseline there is a
recipe for silicon grease and diamond
powder and we're learning again diamond
powder we're even
there's also mustard is it is this
potions class like tin severus snape
hook you up with a wish I would love to
have Snape as my thermal paste
instructor okay so so that's your plan
for your video and then if if one of our
team members who's like not necessarily
that comfortable in front of the camera
has something hmm are you gonna do the
script review process and like or
something yeah I guess so I mean I might
you might end up getting a call Linus on
your oh I kind of assumed I kind of
assumed I would get at least one call
yeah
well know try not to still has my phone
this one's supposed to be me and
somebody else maybe oh really yeah oh
who are you gonna do with oh okay okay
Anthony's wearing headphones so it'll be
Alex
ouch dang things my god fun so it's
gonna be not Anthony Anthony alright oh
wait is that wait oh yeah yeah no that's
not embargoed okay yeah so we're a
little late on our GTX
1160 excuse me sixteen sixty okay
honestly that was not even on purpose
they should have called it the eleven
sixty it's so stupid that they didn't
anyway Anthony's working on all the
graphs for our 1160 video really
interesting approach that he's created
actually for how we evaluate value in
our reviews now so it used to be that in
a graphics card review we would take
whatever the cost of the graphics card
is let's say $200 or $300 or whatever
and we would divide that by no we would
take the FPS we divide that by the
dollars the graphics card costs and then
that would give us FPS per dollar a
value measure the problem with FPS per
dollar is that it doesn't account for
the cost of the entire system so what
we've started doing and this was
Anthony's initiative is breaking out the
value of a graphics card as an upgrade
so as a standalone component compared to
the value of a graphics card as part of
a total system where we'll actually look
at different total system price points
and figure out if that graphics card
would make any sense at those different
price points because the thing is once
you even if a gtx 1050 is the best FPS
per dollar if you were spending two
grand or three thousand dollars on your
computer it would be such a bottleneck
that and it would be such a small part
of the overall budget that you have that
if you were to spend twice as much on
something in order to get you know 20%
or 30% more FPS your overall system
might only be 10% more expensive or 5%
more expensive but be 20 or 30% faster
so so it's just a different way of
looking at value and it's it's made the
graphs and charts a little bit more
confusing but hopefully you guys can
follow
along with us here so we'll talk about
doesn't make sense as an upgrade
component versus doesn't make sense as
like part of a $500 or 1000 or 1500
dollar system anyway
Anthony you also have a project while
I'm gone delia I do you I think I have
to - yeah well I think you said that one
you were kind of thinking that you're
gonna do yourself any well which one was
that that was the node or ways to build
guide oh yeah so I don't know I mean you
guys can let us know it's been a long
time since we've done a build guide
actually did you pitch it to me I think
so right yeah so Anthony pitched to me
he was like yo we haven't done a build
guide in literally a year I was like oh
oops because this item scrapyard wars
build guides are the things that people
walk up to me at trade shows or on the
street and I'm like - been love your
content your build guide you taught me
how to you taught me how to build a
computer and for me that's awesome and
then I've basically taken a year off
from the thing that people get most
amped about and so I'm like oh yeah
that's a good idea Anthony so the
concept for it is the no dollar wasted
build guide so every component
contributes to performance in some way
so I kind of thought given it's been a
long time since we've done a build guide
I should probably host it regardless of
vacation so maybe I should do it when I
get back but you guys can let me know in
the comments if you'd like to see
someone else from the team host it yeah
that would be pretty tough what else did
you have planned for him done which
angle are you gonna take on it first I
think I'm gonna take the most powerful
the most powerful Anglos powerful Mac
the most powerful back I mean we could
also just do a video that's like a guide
of how to do it yeah rather than go
right into the like the wow factor stuff
we could just do more like a tutorial or
like I don't know okay you know what
yeah it's it's kind of up to you we
could also just do the wow factor one
and then do a tutorial as a follow up
how
do it to gamers one CPU was an
interesting one because that one we had
the wow factor payoff but we actually
structured the video itself more like a
tutorial yeah so that one I don't know
I'm kind of I'm kind of flexible on it
whatever you're most comfortable with
because Anthony may end up hosting it or
he may hand off to someone else to
co-host or he may handle off to someone
else to host entirely but he's gonna be
working with the rest of the team you
guys can let him know in the comments
below what approach you'd like to see
him take oh sorry yet something you say
yeah I was actually going to say that we
could possibly also do the Linux gaming
update well we've been planning on doing
that but it kind of fell off our radar
during the last content meeting oh
that's true actually we could do that um
that's that's a great idea too we're not
actually out of ideas it has never
actually happened there's too many
things to do and not enough time yeah I
think a proton update would make a ton
of sense yeah cuz it's very it's
becoming very mature now cool I mean
very mature I think is like you mean in
like Linux terms right most games that
don't have anti-cheat okay so like
thanks Jake speaking of old games
nothing actually I've given up on
segways actually making any sense
whatsoever at this point you know that
part of the joke by the way shout out to
Salvador thank you sorry I'm just
and also not so good youtuber I that's
the name that's the name I thought you
were just talking to yourself no no no
see okay I get so much flak for
supposedly the way that I'm like abusive
to my staff or whatever the kind of crap
they give me you wouldn't even you
wouldn't even believe it it would make
your it would make your hair curl
what are you working currently or for
next week uh why not both okay so
currently fix the teleprompter this is
super boring I don't know where I put it
I'm trying to fix this stupid thing that
you've David broke I guess oh here it is
so this teleprompter which makes our
world go round has broken in two places
actually so this little springy
sproinging thing just popped out of
there so we're gonna hard mount
something in there and then the whole
bracket just completely snapped off so
that's what I'm spending my time doing
it's fixing the progression
oh it's 3d printing right now wow I'm
gonna have to go wide Kent whatever you
know what trust us it's 3d printing
there's a there's a feet of it
downstairs and then we're figuring out
the new office layout which is oh yeah
they're Bor yeah I was supposed to look
through that with you oh yeah that looks
fine okay and then there's that this is
cool so this is the monster lab oh is
this gonna be ready for me to do
something with today or no okay you can
see the zap straps on that vrm cooler oh
wow
very non-standard okay and that's yeah
so this is a passive case that's
designed to have aftermarket components
installed in it instead of being just
prefab like the Compu lab err top which
we checked out before here that coil one
yeah well that's just part of the
reality of silent cases you make the
fans quiet enough or take them off or
take them off and you just end up
hearing an electrical noise Wow
electronics are loud yeah but for next
week this is a really exciting thing
we're gonna see how much better it is to
cool a computer with a sync with your
sync so we're gonna our sink into this
water clean loop and see what kind of
temperatures we get and if there was any
doubt that he's my protege
[Laughter]
I don't like compare it to a standard
water clean loop it's already in here
yeah I think we're gonna measure how
much water we're wasting okay yeah I
mean I guess the results would vary
based on where you live yeah and you
know what what you could also you could
also fine-tune it to like you could try
to fine-tune the amount of water you're
wasting you have a little valve and you
don't always have to use it so say you
start gaming you run over to the
bathroom you flip the switch you're like
alright I'm good to go
drop my
temps 10 degrees oh lordy
okay is that gonna be like a vlog or is
just like scripted with lots of graphs
so like with me and Alex I think okay
hey you're gonna have time next week
alright so I guess I'm making time for
that I think alex is gonna be pretty in
demand cuz like are you planning to
actually host anything yourself
oh maybe cuz I know you've already been
tapped as a sidekick for two projects
from other people it's like he's a great
sidekick I have to say I can work on
next week like I have it's not the
popular air talk you just said that and
it messed me up
what's the little guy desk mini the
eight could that tiny eight core that's
like kind of like it's it's like a PC
Mac Mini it is sweet yeah it's it's
pretty cool
but we're also gonna compare to the Mac
Mini yeah probably gonna do good I don't
know the lust was kind of loud but also
like this big at least they got cooled
correctly I'm like you know Apple
computers which they just are like yeah
well they're designed to thermal
throttle like right but that doesn't
make it correct that just means that you
did that
but the Mac Mini has 10-gig which is
also um yeah I know what else you got
planned for next week um other thing the
Alienware area 51 M arrived today oh did
it finally get here yeah oh cool that
thing is BA yeah I am really stoked to
like well we've already taken it apart
but like take it apart again yeah well
you didn't get to take it no uh it's a
lot of work to take apart I mean you
were there yeah there's a lot of screws
that looked like hell on wheels to put
back together yeah Raymond said that
he's not putting it back together for us
this time okay so we can't just like put
all the parts in a bucket and ship it
back Koby so just just to like just to
demonstrate to him that if we tell him
he's putting it back together that he is
putting it back together that would be
so rude
it is amazing that we have any friends
left in the industry whatsoever but like
how many views that video like
realistically the ROI is pretty good on
them putting that back together yeah
exactly I mean how much is the
technician who's tasked with putting it
together paid anyway you know actually
was it right I think so yeah okay so it
was it was pretty expensive then he's
kind of important over there all right
then what are you working on right now
so we did a tour of triumph this week so
I'm kind of going through the footage
and making it make sense for the editor
it's like you look at this and you're
like what the heck science right yep I
would do that or like let's see like
right here is a three hundred thousand
watt power supply and over you mean yes
both it's 1 mega watt 1 mega watt 1
million 1 million watts so this is one
of the things that people don't realize
you know back to my point about luminous
what do you have like a giant writing
death and stuff in order to make our
videos as accurate and as good as we can
we actually have a lot more processes
now than we used to so now we have the
writer go through and make sure that all
the b-roll corresponds to the actual
thing we're talking about even when
we're tackling much more complex
projects than we used to so for those
wondering a triumph is a local particle
accelerator here at the University of
British Columbia
so yeah they have the largest cyclotron
in the world and soon to be the most
powerful electron accelerator so like
it's like a yearly bowling real low
science stuff and it was I mean we we
you know I I think I passed my 100 level
chem course so you know we try but the
thing is we we spent a lot of time Alex
actually spent an entire day with like
probably about a dozen of some of the
smartest people in the country it was
crazy
learning about this stuff and you know
trying to put it all in terms that are
somewhat understandable for
and then we had it all verified by them
so we're hoping that's gonna be a really
good video we're really excited about it
yeah this one's definitely higher level
than normal like I normally go for like
what would you say like great 8th level
like you can probably understand it this
one like you probably need grade 12
physics to get it okay but try try it
yeah do it click it anyway please
I am blurr says can you compare the Mac
Mini to the highest spec s10 plus using
Samsung Dex probably not for your video
on the desk Mini but that's kind of an
interesting concept personally I'm not
expecting it to be anything special
though it's still a snapdragon or Exynos
processor and yeah they're faster than
last gen but it's not they're not twice
as fast
and finally laser James what are you
working on right now
Rancho oh that makes sense are we doing
adaptive controller today yeah if you
ever review the script with me okay cool
ready cool um what do you have going on
next week well we recently reviewed LG
and Dells new monitors that are also 49
inch super ultra wide monitors but
rather than being 1080p like this one
there 1440p so we just did a video
reviewing them and the next week when
you're gone I'm gonna do a video about a
setup that has 349 inch 32 by 9 monitors
so like the ultimate surround setup kind
of thing like a Hobbit's would you say
180 degrees setup what the hell kind of
desk are you gonna use for that I don't
know it's probably not do it in your
office oh well thank you are you gonna
leave it there we're gonna change the
locks you go away for you go away for
one week one week that's all I ask
okay that sounds pretty good so actually
it was one of James's recent videos that
gave me the confidence to go away and
expect these guys to be able to hold
down the fort by themselves without me
because James actually hosted what was
what was it again the chemos economic
it's not here yeah who knows where that
is
it was a it's like urgh anomic keyboard
that has to split modules and you can
move them as a mouse as well
so James hosted it and all the
indicators that we would normally look
at like the communities like to dislike
ratio comments retention like all that
stuff actually was fine and I was like
not abused though I didn't get it didn't
get a ton of use but like all right
honestly I was half tempted to make
today's stream about some of the
algorithmic changes that as far as I can
tell there's really no denying that
YouTube is making right now that are
again like I don't like complaining back
to what I said at the beginning of the
stream you know by and large I consider
myself lucky to have the coolest job in
the universe but right now YouTube is
making some algorithmic changes that are
that are really hurting as far as I can
tell okay I don't actually have
confirmation from them they never
confirm anything like that but as far as
I can tell they are doing significant
damage not to our new content all of our
new stuff is still doing really well but
to our back catalogue so we have videos
that would typically do two hundred
three hundred views a day just because
like people would stumble across oh you
know he this radiator with your gaming
system and it'll heat your room you know
like we did a video about that a while
back and it would do like actually that
