intel core i7 4770k unlocked processor
if you're a speed freak added until 3500
series SSD to your Haswell system for a
truly enthusiast class experience
welcome to a much demanded unboxing this
is from gigabytes g1 killer series of
boards this is the g1 sniper 5 gaming
motherboard now a lot of people ask me
what what the heck is a gaming
motherboard
I think gigabyte had it mostly right
with the original g1 series board so
that was the assassin the sniper and the
gorilla but there were a few things that
they got wrong at the time it was a very
strange platform to have a premium
gaming Board on LGA 1366 when there was
a more updated platform on a different
socket and also they were extremely
expensive gigabyte has adjusted pricing
down somewhat compared to the original
assassin but keep kept the premium
features coming so they've actually been
improved over those older boards even
though the sniper 5 is not as expensive
as the assassin was that isn't to say
that this is an inexpensive motherboard
because my friends it is not it is
extremely expensive let's go ahead and
run through the accessories like look at
this box of accessories is unbelievable
four-way SLI bridge 3-way SLI bridge
2-way SLI bridge no crossfire bridge
that's ok that should come with your
your motherboard USB cable 4d I believe
this is for the Bluetooth guy bluetooth
and Wi-Fi
sorry crossfire bridge there you go nice
black one matches your board next up
we've got antenna for Wireless next up
we've got ha front three and a half inch
USB 3 bay device who ought that pop grid
kit I'll show you this later ok a nice
sexy black IO shield 1 2 3 6 SATA 3
connectors cables not connectors a
manual another more different guidebook
a manual for the wireless and finally a
gigabyte
sticker yes one of the most complete
accessory kits ever and what I like
about gigabytes Wireless implementation
is it's just PCI Express they don't use
some proprietary module so if you happen
to buy yourself a sniper five and you
don't want Wireless on your gaming
motherboard that has super advanced
onboard wired networking you grab this
thing you throw it in another machine
like your media center PC and boom
you've got Bluetooth and wireless on
that machine instead I think it's a
great value add and more manufacturers
should move towards non proprietary
accessories with their boards as opposed
to stuff that you can only use only with
this board and owned only this board
okay anyway so moving right along we've
got black solid caps rated at 10,000
hours at 105 degrees which is unlikely
to happen in your computer please don't
let your computer run at 105 degrees a
gold-plated CPU socket this is one of
the few scenarios where gold plating
would actually matter because what's
good about gold plating is that it's
malleable meaning that it will last for
more insertions and removals which is
one of the problems with these LGA
sockets they're not actually rated for
very many of them it has a two times
copper BCB so this is part of their
ultra durable five concept they're glass
fabric PCB that makes it more resistant
to humidity as well as all ir digital
power phases so those are under there
and unfortunately you can't really see
them but you'll have to trust me they're
really good and particularly on my
gigabyte board so i use an x 79 up5 on
my personal system no coil line
whatsoever which is definitely thumbs up
other physical saw that i consider that
i consider this a durable feature but i
don't think that's actually how they
brand it but some somewhere on here
there are two physical there they are
two physical UEFI BIOS chips meaning
that you can switch between them there's
actually an LED indicator so you can see
which one you're using and I want to
move right along to the cooling
solutions so this is one of the things
they were really talking about a lot at
Computex it uses I would consider this a
three option cooling solution so it can
be either completely passive there you
go see you can see the heat pipe that
connects it all the way down to the
Southbridge area here or you can run an
active fan to cool it gigabyte claims
that silence I call bollocks on that
because all these little tiny fans have
irritating wine that drives me
absolutely crazy so I would leave that
off or you can use the integrated liquid
cooling for maximum cooling you use 3/8
inch barbs and while I would have
preferred a G 1/4 socket like a soos is
implemented on the Maximus 6 formula the
key difference between this and the
Maximus 6 formulas is actually available
right from the launch of as well and
well there that this is actually
available right now although that will
be coming soon I would have preferred
that but I use 3/8 inch tubes anyway so
it wouldn't bother me personally that
much but if you prefer 1/2 inch or
quarter inch or you want to use nice
angled compressions then you're pretty
much out of luck on this one
it also has 9 integrated fan connectors
of which 7 of them are fully
controllable and one of them is kind of
special so there's the CPU fan connector
right up here as well as the CPU
optional one this is optimized for
things like hooking up a secondary pump
that you want to run at a hundred
percent all the time or some large heat
sinks that actually have dual fans on
them you can plug that in and that's
sort of an auxiliary CPU fan header
other than that we've got a couple more
here only three pins unfortunately I'd
like to see more manufacturers moving
towards entirely 4 pin PWM fan header
designs you've got one two three four
along the bottom really like to see this
because particularly with a lot of cases
that have basements whether it's car
drive cooling fans or radiators or
whatever else down there it's nice to
have the option to plug everything into
the bottom of the board as well and then
there's one here at the back which is
again nice to see so they've really put
a lot of thought into where those fan
headers are as opposed to just you know
putting them all up here as if we're all
running front five and a quarter bay
mounted fans like who does that
nobody does that anyway moving right
along gaming oriented features so it
supports four-way crossfire and four-way
SLI which means that using plx chips and
PCI Express Lanes bitters and all that
stuff you're achieving at least PCIe 8 X
2.0 per slot when you install four cards
however it should be noted that those
splitters don't magically add more
bandwidth to the platform and they can
actually introduce latency so I don't
necessarily like the implementation but
Nvidia limits SLI compatible slots to
ones that operate at 8
or more for their reported speed so in
order to get four-way SLI working that's
what gigabyte had to do and to make it
sort of as gaming balls to the walls as
they could they wanted four-way
crossfire and four-way SLI support
you've also got three additional PCIe 1x
slots other gaming features this right
here actually will move into audio later
so this right here dual and
implementation so they've got a an Intel
Nick as well as a Bigfoot Network so
remember that is a Qualcomm solution now
Bigfoot networks a 2200 meaning that
you've got on the fly packet
prioritization for your gaming traffic
as well as a couple of other neat
software implementation features that I
really like for example you could limit
the bandwidth available project to a
particular application so when I used to
upload YouTube videos on my home
connection that wasn't as strong it
would just kill the internet connections
of everyone else in the house because it
was completely saturating it then within
it with a Bigfoot Nick I could actually
limit it to no only upload at this speed
so everyone else was able to use the
Internet as well so that's something
that I really like to see and remember
guys the SATA ports are
color-coordinated so the six black ones
are going to be off the Intel chipset
and those four gray ones are off of the
Marvel chipset in terms of other
connectors on the board that are notable
we've got onboard power and reset
connectors as well as on board v
checkpoints and a post indicator LED a
24 pin power connector I personally
consider extremely Andy as well as
onboard USB 3 you can tell from the red
background that that supports their
on/off charge feature which allows you
to charge even high current draw android
or iOS devices even while the computer
is off you've got auxiliary power I
recommend using this if you're running
three graphics cards or more you've also
got your front panel connectors an
additional front USB 3 connector
although this one does not support
on/off charge as well as 2 USB 2 front
panel connectors and front audio which
leads us to audio so this right here
this little strip actually illuminates
green when the board is powered on and
represents a physical segregation
between the rest of the board and the
part of the PCB that handles audio this
is the first time we've seen this
feature and it kind of
smacks of a bit of uh while they were
doing it so we were doing it sort of
thing especially with the LED
illumination but it's a good feature and
I'm glad to see it implemented on more
boards gigabyte has taken their sort of
their awesome onboard audio concept that
they first introduced with the g1 series
and they've really upped the ante so
check this out they're using a sound
Core 3d quad core processor for the
sound processor how meaningful is it
that it's quad core not at all but what
you do get is you get creatives software
suite and you have Hardware accelerating
it so it couldn't be that bad
even if quad core doesn't necessarily
mean anything you've also got audio
grade capacitors here and check that out
swappable op-amp on a motherboard so
that's what this little kit here was for
it actually includes a chip puller as
well as a second op-amp so you can try
out which one you like more what op-amps
do is they change the signature of the
sound they change the sort of I don't
want to say quality but they do change
the quality subjective quality of the
sound so you can not only try out the
two that come with your board but you
can swap in pretty much whatever you
want and really change the way that the
sound operates they've also got an
amplifier that is capable of powering up
to 600 ohm headphones however if you're
running headphones like that you
shouldn't be using onboard audio even if
it's fantastic onboard audio and all of
the audio connectors look at those those
are sexy are gold-plated which may
actually matter for these connectors
because you want to make sure you have a
nice solid connection it is an analogue
connector particularly for digital
connections like USB it totally doesn't
matter but this it might actually help
especially if you unplug and plug things
in repeatedly
and as far as convenience features go
they have their automated overclocking
as well as their Q flash utility that
makes BIOS flashes a breeze and I think
I've covered the other things that I
wanted to say about that let's move
right along to onboard i/o here we go so
two USB 2.0 ports a ps2 keyboard mouse
combo port I still like to see these
coaxial digital audio out as well as
optical digital audio out six USB 3.0
ports dual hdmi displayport and 7.1
audio out the power connectors including
the eight pin up here as well as the 24
pin over on the right-hand edge are in
their optimal locations
and it should be noted this is a
slightly wider board than normal so it's
an e ATX board but not a fully te ATX
board so it only uses the standard ATX
mounting holes thank you for checking
out this unboxing don't forget to
subscribe Lyons tech tips from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and
leave a comment let me know what you
think guys we just spend $400 on a
motherboard at this point or would you
buy a cheaper board maybe one hundred
and fifty dollar board gigabyte have
some great hundred and fifty dollar
boards throw a high end sound card in it
throw a high end NIC card in it and call
that a day which do you actually think
is a better option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
