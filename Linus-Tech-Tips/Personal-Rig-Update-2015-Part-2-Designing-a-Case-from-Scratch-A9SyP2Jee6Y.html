a little different for starters I'm
filming right now obviously and yet my
personal rig is about 20 minutes away by
car at my house on my desk so how can we
update it well good question we're going
to be doing something that we've never
done before we will be building a case
from scratch
so come along with us for the ride of
your life as Taryn and I collaborate to
design the new case that we'll be
sending to proto case for fabrication oh
and if custom cases don't appeal to you
that you can drop a like on this video
if you want to see another video that
I'm planning where I'll be building a
sick rig with no case at all ah that's
going to be awesome too
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so our
adventure started in the server room not
because we couldn't look up the
dimensions of a standard rackmount
chassis on the Internet
oh yeah for those of you who missed part
one we'll be building my personal rig in
a rack mount case this time but because
to control the scope of the project I
wanted to pick out a size that I figured
I could move around fairly easily then
work backwards to see what kind of
hardware I could fit inside versus just
kind of coming up with the dream
hardware spec list and then ending up
with the Corsair 900 d like what
evidently happened to George so then it
was time to take those measurements to
our 3d modelling program of choice
Sketchup and yes yes I know Sketchup is
not the best modeling software on the
face of the earth but you know what
it's what Terran knows how to use and
this is a video about designing a case
not a video about learning a brand new
3d modeling software or whatever so we
built out the outer walls making sure
that our case would conform to the
standard width of a rack-mounted case
and to my length target to keep the
overall size reasonable we're going with
a four UK so that takes care of the
height that's for standard rackmount
height units tall
because while a 3u would accommodate
full height expansion cards like
graphics cards
it would make using all 120 millimeter
fans in the design untenable and while
the acoustics of the system technically
don't really matter with this project
because I'll be moving the finished
system outside of my office into a
closet I'd still prefer to use them even
if only so that I can use the custom n
ff12 fans that we have Noctua making in
our ltte color scheme so there were a
couple noteworthy things that were
really cool about this project for us
but first was that we discovered just
how deep the library of PC component
models is in the online database and
while some of them are not to scale for
some reason
others are both shockingly accurate and
perfectly to scale allowing a custom rig
maker to really test out his or her
design before doing any of the really
expensive prototyping steps is really
great for working on PC projects like
this I also discovered why most case
designers probably learned a 3d model
themselves
I swear Taryn spent about a billion
years fixing the coherency of the model
or some stupid crap when I must have
told them a dozen times Taryn we're just
submitting this to someone else to fix
up and ultimately manufacture they're
gonna deal with the picky details but
here's like notes abort until fine
speaking of guidance I guess this is a
good opportunity to show you guys why I
did need Taryn to help me so this is the
mock-up that I originally submitted to
proto cakes when I was pitching them the
concept of an enthusiast grade water
cooled for you case they were like hmm
okay
yes I see where you're going with this
but could we get something a little more
uh detailed but but but for all its
faults that original mock-up did help us
through the creation of the proper 3d
model so we determined after some
fooling around with different fan models
that we need to use 120 millimeter fans
in the front because while 140
millimeter fans would fit there wouldn't
be enough clearance for the tanks at the
ends of the radiator if we wanted the
middle fans centered in the front of the
case something my OCD simply required to
happen and then using the tried-and-true
method of folding it out of paper than
handing it to someone else to 3d model I
showed Taryn how I wanted the second
Bank of fans and second radiator to
mount behind the first one between these
two and a potential final single 120
millimeter that gives me now a total of
seven 120 millimeter radiator spot saw
plenty of cooling for the hardware I'll
be putting inside the next stage was
figuring out how the rest of our
components were going to fit in the
space that we had now the original plan
yes I know it's terrible had a dual tube
reservoir set up with two pumps one for
each which is more
for redundancy in the event of a pump
failure than anything else after
inserting a motherboard and power supply
we realized that in order to have our
hard pipe tubing setup look good I mean
yes we could have made it work the
original way but to make it look good we
had to scale it back to a single pump
and reservoir not what I was aiming for
but a first-world problem for sure so no
real no big deal with all that in place
all that was really left was the little
picky detail work which ended up
actually taking about as long as the
test fitting spacing of the motherboard
and power supply had to be tweaked to
ensure that a dual slot card could be
installed in the bottom PCI slot on a7
slot motherboard to give the system more
expandability Taran remodeled our d5
pump to have the same ek top that I'll
be using in the build then adjusted the
mounting foam for the pump to ensure
that it would line up perfectly with the
outlet on the reservoir giving our hard
line tubing a really clean look there
the cable management holes were created
in the radiator mounting plate for the
front red and fence
we added SSD mounting on the side of the
chassis because even though I'll be
using a 1.2 terabyte 750 series PCI
Express SSD from Intel and an as for my
main storage mean who knows someone else
may want to replicate this project but
use a normal SSD so we might as well
build in that functionality and then
finally while this was basically
eyeballed cable management space was
left to run the a pin and 24 pin
motherboard connector z' and pci express
power cleanly along the bottom of the
chassis next to the motherboard and this
is basically it what you're looking at
here my next case which will be hidden
away in my closet we're actually don't
have to look at it but it will be able
to be looked at it'll look pretty good
still and it'll deliver the same
performance and functionality that it
would even if it was right next to me so
now it's time to submit this puppy to
proto case along with technical drawings
of key components like radiators who is
then going to mock it up and hopefully
if all goes according to plan fold up
some steel screw
together powdercoat that sucker and send
it back to me when you guys will get the
