unboxing of a USB 3.0 that is super
speed USB which is ten times faster
although they don't say ten times faster
than what I'm going to go ahead and
assume it's USB 2.0 but we won't be
making assumptions for long as a
follow-up to this unboxing I'm actually
be going to be doing a test where I
compare USB 3.0 against USB 2.0 e-sata
as well as firewire so let's just break
all the seals on here then we'll go
around and have a look at the okay first
of all inside the contents we have the
Samba enclosure USB 3.0 a sea adapter
check it out I have the knife today we
have a stand hard disk mounting screws
on an installation guide is compatible
with windows 7 vista and XP and probably
stuff ashley no i don't know hard to say
what the USB three drivers would work
with i guess those are probably the only
three it is compatible what seems like
any mac as long as you're using OS 10.3
or later and then specifications are
here well we'll have a closer look at it
oh here we go USB 3.0 it's compatible
with USB 2.0 and USB one point X very
nice okay so we can open up the box if I
can open up the box sometimes it's more
challenging than other times haha there
we go so there's the enclosure but we're
not gonna get to that just yet the Samba
like the lion king no no that's Simba
okay doesn't stand on its own okay so
the first thing aside we find a very
bulky power adapter dura Micro Inc so
that's a 2 amp power adapter runs at 12
volts which is what hard drives run off
so that makes a whole lot of sense I
guess it doesn't really matter if it's
bulky it's not like you're gonna be it's
not like this is a portable drive
enclosure you're not going to be
particularly carrying it around then we
have a USB 3.0 so you can see the ends
are actually quite different from a USB
2.0 so it's a very different shape but
you can put a USB 2.0 cable inside this
port so you see the shape of a USB 2.0
be cable here well the USB 3.0 skies
kind of like an extra doohickey on the
end of it
next we have a stand oh it looked like
it was metal but it's not actually it's
plastic so I guess the stand kind of uh
goes on here somehow yeah I'd have to
figure out oh I see you have to screw it
in from the inside okay so you have to
actually take the enclosure apart it'll
kind of look like this I'm gonna
simulate the experience here there we go
it'll kind of look like that so it has
little ventilation ok hold on the level
finish up like that users guide and then
I'll show you the actual enclosure so
here's the installation guide so to show
you some precautions packaging content
system requirements 702 enclosures at a
glance installing a pci express card no
I guess this one doesn't include that I
think there are some that do though um
installing a disconnecting the drive to
your computer off three year limited
warranty excellent ok so in here we've
got this seems to be all English so
that's quite a detailed guide showing
you everything from hooking it up to
your computer to installing the drive
inside it and then there is a French
version as well since this is Canada and
we have french people and then we have a
four screws it would appear in one size
and those would be for installing the
hard drive in all likelihood and then we
have more screws and I don't know what
those are for but I'm guessing that
great installation guide has some
details about that you can see that
they're in the factory they've installed
two screws for whatever reason so maybe
there are two here to go in the other
two spots and then the other four for
installing the dry but then you still
have two extra I don't understand it ok
so then here we've got what appears to
be a might be a Kensington lock but it
doesn't have the logo and there's like
nothing inside it so I'm not going to
assume anything then we have the power
in USB 3.0 as well as 2 point 0 and 1
point 1 compatible port here and then we
have an on/off switch also at the back
and then around to the side of the unit
you can see it's got kind of a shiny but
but brushed finish can you see that
cameramen yeah you can see that ok great
and then they've got their a comdata
logo on the side I sort of showed you
the bottom but the bottom has like an
indent here
where these little notches will go
inside and then you can screw the score
from the top down into the base if you
would like to have a base on it then at
the front you've got some grill holes
for ventilation and all that good stuff
around on this side you see the same
thing a comdata logo as well as like
kind of a nice brushed finish on it and
that is it that is the a comdata samba
USB 3.0 superspeed three and a half inch
hard drive enclosure yeah so cameraman
brought up an interesting point i
unboxed a a hard drive enclosure without
actually unboxing the box so I never
actually took it apart for you guys so
here I'm just going to take those two
random screws out and then we'll have a
look at what exactly is inside of the
Samba here so first we have a little
backplate thingamajiggy then we okay
looks like this is going to slide out
for me here hmm or not who does that oh
it slides out the other way okay so you
can see right through it now there's no
rails or anything on it so it's just
fitted to the right size to just kind of
go inside all right so then inside we
have a couple wires here these are for
the hard drive activity LED which
presumably is here as well as the no
that's a power switch so where's the
activity LED no no there is no activity
LED unless this one is also powered but
one way or another it is a power switch
that is for certain and then okay here
inside you see the chipset here which is
converting your USB 3.0 signal to a
sated to signal or vice versa and then
we've also got some capacitors as well
as the leads for the power switch okay
that is pretty much it there's a it's
kind of a plasticky sort of internal
structure i'm guessing as soon as you
put a hard drive in there it'll have a
bit more rigidity to it but these screws
are going to go in from what looks like
the bottom so as soon as you put the
hard drive in you're just going to screw
it in from the bottom and then you would
be sliding it back
back into this interface and then
screwing it in so yeah that's pretty
straightforward so again thank you for
checking on my unboxing of the ecomm day
to say bye seated whatever it was cool
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
