brought to you by Squarespace build it
beautiful so we found something that
seemed pretty unlikely at the Sony booth
this my friends is a watch it's $300 so
it's not exactly cheap but you know for
a watch not exactly expensive and you
can walk up to it it's got this flat
display on the front you can swipe your
fingers back and forth and absolutely
crap all will happen because it is not a
smart watch no my friends this is the
fest watch it's an e-ink like ePaper
watch that is purely a watch and fashion
accessory it's got an adjustable band as
you'd expect it's completely seamless
there's no holes in the display side of
it itself and by clicking the one button
on the side you can cycle through 20
different patterns depending on what
kind of a mood you're in that's pretty
much it there's nothing to say about it
other than that so if you're into you
know simple technology then this might
be your thing otherwise well we've got
something else to show you as well so
pretty much my favorite thing at CES is
being told that I'm right and last year
when I went around to all the different
TV booths I was like oh yeah it's a
really shiny TV that's a shiny TV
tounament Oh Sony I actually don't care
how shiny your TV is because you
actually had the sense to implement
Android into it instead of you know
building your own operating system that
let's face it nothing is ever going to
support the way that Android will be and
this right here is like a super awesome
validation for me because one of the
biggest things preventing me from
investing in philips hue lighting or you
know Lutron light switches or the
battery-operated blinds that i've got to
my right over here is the fact that
they've all got completely separate apps
some of which work well some of which
are frankly compete complete trash and
it's it's actually more effort to pull
my phone out of my pocket and kind of
like by that time I might as well get
off my ass and go adjust my thermostat
because it's time to sleep and I want it
to be a little bit cooler this this is
cool
is the harmony home hub and it is
actually working in tandem Sony and
Logitech are working together with a
Sony smart TV running Android to take
that fragmented ecosystem and make all
of those devices work together just with
the native Android support that they
have and with the TV communicating
directly with the Harmony Home Hub so
you can actually use a harmony remote
you can use your phone with the Harmony
app or you can even use your sony tv
remote as well so you press the discover
button and I'm gonna discover something
other than Adam Sandler in my life just
kidding I do happy gilmore is actually
one of my favorite all-time movies and
I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna say okay
goodnight what happens with goodnight is
the lighting changes or turns off takes
a minute
the blinds go all the way down and boom
all of a sudden I'm sleeping my TV is
now off now this is really cool and
there are over 200,000 Internet of
Things devices that are going to be
supported by this solution but the one
thing that's still missing and that I'm
really hoping to get like super excited
press release email from Sony about
sometime in the near future is hey we
figured out how to make it work while
the TV is not already on because you
can't run the Android operating system
on the TV without the screen being on
just yet but I'm really excited to see
someone whether it's Logitech or Sony or
some combination of the two trying to
figure out how to make all this stuff
actually accessible in addition to being
something that I spend a bunch of money
on and is inside my house so don't miss
