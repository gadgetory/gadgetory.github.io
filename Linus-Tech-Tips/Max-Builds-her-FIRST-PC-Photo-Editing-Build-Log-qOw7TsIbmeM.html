is it that you go out of your way to
specifically hire a hand model for your
b-roll shots but then you never have her
actually build the computer and the
reason is that max has never built a
computer before nope but that's okay
because we have a plan today max
actually won this cryo rig Taku case at
our Christmas party and resolved to
build a computer so because max is
actually paying for all the rest of the
parts as much fun as it is to do like
balls to the wall crazy rigs all the
time over here this is gonna be a very
value or whatever it is that you do
what's it for tumblr mostly it's not
what you told us before we helped you
with the config damn it max photo
editing photo editing great thank you
and we're gonna go ahead and get max
through this whole ordeal Origen they're
sponsoring this video they build custom
desk ops they got high performance
laptops and lifetime support and they
use only high quality products like
samsung's 960 pro m2 SSD visit origin PC
at the link below today for a special
promotion
you have filmed our videos mm-hmm you
have watched our videos yes yes dammit
what's the first step what do you mean
oh the computer motherboard motherboard
yeah yeah yeah go ahead go look I'm here
for support all right I'm not I'm not
here to do it for you configuration for
like a Photoshop or even maybe light
video editing machine pretty much starts
at least today until we get lower end
chipsets with AZ 370 boards so this is e
370 I gaming cuz for your CPU you're
gonna be using a core i5 8400 now the
CPU I'm going to match this corner here
with this corner here there you go it's
like you're pro you even gave it a
little wiggle yep hmm professional all
right not bad no way Ram yeah yeah so
something you guys might have noticed is
that the RAM we're using is not it
doesn't have LEDs it doesn't have heat
spreaders on it even believe it or not
LEDs do not make your memory go faster
so if all you want is performance then
you're better off spending money for
extra RAM so we've got 16 gigs in here
which should be enough for photo editing
or video editing even next up anything
ah heatsink yeah did you cheat are you
over here I'm not ok yeah you're
probably not cuz cooler was actually
above ram over here but it doesn't
matter oh you have worked here for a
year now haven't you yeah cuz I'm kind
of sitting you're doing like I I had
actually intended to do like a first
time or PC build you're actually kind of
doing everything right sorry I pay
attention which I mean in a good way
yeah maybe I'll just quit max do you
want to take over max do you want to
take over maximum tactics I would have
maybe that's less than one tech tip we
went with the c7 because it's low
profile and we had one lying around it's
pretty that was not very - are you sure
yes
hey this is max on it he thought of
everything that's good yeah humor mmm no
that's good that's good this thing is in
the way just because it's your first
bill doesn't mean that we can't break
out a dremel have you used power tools
before max I'm not allowed okay so we're
gonna just forget about the power tools
you've got a couple of different options
I have the hairspray option take max we
can use fire can melt it
I saw the max survivor what we're
actually gonna do is use this file okay
is it the same rules with nails you can
only file one way you bet
I'm gonna ruin my own nails doing this
like really worried I'm far less
concerned about your manicure and far
more concerned about this very expensive
wrap job that we had done on this tip
how much this table cost do you have any
idea how much automatic your cost less
than the table you can psych it threw up
for the year you know what I did the
math it's not good they're great see how
it sits and it doesn't wiggle anymore
yes oh wow this is I'm ruining it like
the plastic that matters so this case
was modded by the one and only James
tried he used plastidip so if you
ultimately don't like it then you can
just rip it off you're gonna do it
aren't you Wow
you know what my favorite colors Wow
favorite colors red so your favorite
color is not blue and purple which we
chose because we thought max PC max no
okay other particles here
hmm okay but this very nice forgetting
the IO shield that is a very common
first-time mistake
I have watched too many computers get
built this means our content is working
I have no clue
very cool warm hot no I see it far
there's so many things there are three
things so once again on the drives
you'll probably see that we didn't go
what clearly learned how to build a
computer for me
did you just bump the front of the case
with that metal you're gonna damage that
beautiful paint job oh my god
yeah but it's not just about the size
the length is also key do you want to
hit James after this or should I do it
let's together we're gonna do this to
work nice not bad
now what GPU yes that's it time for
reassembly let's do it not bad at all I
like it she's like yeah I never have
hey there we go alright no that's good
yeah yeah that's all good it's good I
mean it's not all good yet let's just
double check 16 gigs around all detected
core i5 8400 very nice there is our one
terabyte boot drive there is our 4
terabyte storage drive everything here
looks good so far
there's our USB drive that we're gonna
use to install Windows maybe accept that
Windows boot manager is already there so
whoops not something to do OOP OOP yeah
it's working yeah I don't know what I'm
supposed to be looking for why would you
do that
what is wrong with you okay so thank you
guys for watching Max's first ever PC
build it was a success so good job but
I'm not gonna fist bump you because
you're gonna do the weird trailer hitch
thing it's wrong it's bad it's awful
