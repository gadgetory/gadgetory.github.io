in my ear did you just say $800 yes I
did and oh look I did have something in
my ear sennheiser sent me a pair of
ie8 hundreds they're their top tier
in-ear designed and exclusively
manufactured in Germany and at eight
hundred US dollars MSRP they're the most
expensive earphones that I have ever
used but could they possibly be worth
the price tag I guess we'll find out
won't we
mass drop is currently featuring the MSI
GTX 1080 armored 8g check it out and
other drops at the link in the video
description I already know what you're
thinking at that price they better come
with a palm-sized string quartet plays
covers of your favorite show tunes on
command am i right well you can think
that but you'd be completely wrong
because they totally don't in fact
here's an observation that I've made
about accessories in general the higher
end you go it feels like the fewer
things get included I mean have you ever
shopped for a red camera I mean of
course you haven't unless is that Marcus
out there anyway if you had you'd know
that the cost of the camera body is a
hilariously small part of what you'll
spend on the overall setup that you
actually need to use the damn thing so
following along those lines while much
less expensive earphones like the
NuForce lineup from Optima that I
reviewed recently check that out here
include things like a waterproof
carrying case a backup cloth case two
nice cables with stylish braiding or a
microphone inline if you prefer and a
complete set of silicone ear tips with a
couple comfy comply foam ones thrown in
the eye 800s include a cheesy al biet
leather carrying case some silicone ear
tips and a cleaning tool be still my
heart
in Sennheiser's defense the included ear
tips address a problem that i've yet to
find a solution for with the IE 80s my
daily drivers the way that wax guns up
the mesh eventually they have separate
from the usual protective mesh covering
the transducer a driver a second mesh
filter built right into the silicon ear
tip cool unfortunately this proprietary
approach has resulted in very limited
options when it comes to third party ear
tips from comply or others damnit
sennheiser though as someone who is
extremely careful with my ear tips and
who prefers the sound and fit of
silicone tips
I don't personally find this as big of
an issue as some users who have gone as
far as to perform surgery on other ear
tips that they had lying around to try
to use them with their eye 800s no no
the one that I'm more upset about is the
lack of a removable cable a killer
feature of the IE ATS for people like me
who wear their IMS 10 plus hours a day
often while sleeping this feature has
allowed me to first replace my stock
cable that failed with a new one then by
the IE 8i inline microphone as an
upgrade that lets me use my IE 80s as a
hands-free I mean sure the stock cable
is Kevlar reinforced or whatever and is
less likely to fail and you can replace
part of the cable with a pricey first
party microphone one but it plugs into a
sub mini or a two and a half millimeter
jack that's positioned lower than the
ideal microphone placement and the last
8 inches or so is soldered to the
earphone making repairs to that part of
the cable very time-consuming costly or
both let's move on though to what the
cable is attached to on the inside of
the in-ears sennheiser boasts a number
of technological breakthroughs from the
7 millimeter extra wideband dynamic
transducer to the dampened 2 chamber
absorbers to the oval-shaped ear
adapters to the scratch resistant
ceramic housing but the i8 hundreds just
don't look very comfortable do they I'm
used to the native over the ear cable
design of their little cousin the 2
weird ports on the back seem like they'd
stick out and push the whole thing too
far into your ear if you were to lie
down on your side while wearing them and
whatever they might say about scratch
resistance the housings also look like
they'll be kind of cold and hard against
the inside of your ear all of that
however fortunately is wrong I've been
pretty critical of this product so far
and if you're going to charge this much
for something it kind of comes with the
territory but I can't complain about the
comfort even my wife who generally
hate seniors said about them they just
fit worn cabled down with the smallest
ear tips I do find them a bit heavy due
to that connector at the cable split but
I had no difficulty keeping them in
place even with one side dangling aha
and I discovered that though it shortens
the already short cable a bit bringing
the cable over the year allow
significantly deeper insertion for a
more secure fit more noise isolation
improved micro phonics that sound that
the cable can make that you hear in the
inners and for me anyway and ever so
slightly more pleasing sound signature
with a bit more fum
which I guess leads us finally then to
the listening experience there I mean
come on who didn't see this coming far
and away the best I've ever heard highs
are crystal clear and wonderfully
detailed to the point where flaws in low
bitrate files and the mastering of the
top-40 trash that I normally listen to
become much more apparent than with
anything else I've ever listened to mids
are not over powerful but I mean that in
a good way there's no veil for the
vocals to fight through but I don't feel
like the rest of the music is being
compromised either leading us to base
where yeah they're not the most neutral
true to the original recording earphones
on the market I mean if you really
wanted that you'd have a pair of a
domotic er 4 series already anyway there
is definitely some base emphasis but I
mean that in the best possible way with
a shocking amount of kick in the lower
range with fantastic control these are
really fun to listen to and I don't
normally talk about imaging much but the
eye 800s gave me a new appreciation for
this characteristic in a couple of ways
especially when worn cabled down for
musical recording pinpointing where on
the stage the pianist was located was
pretty cool but and I discovered this
totally by accident the open sound of
these earphones also made VR better most
in ears feel like you're listening to
something that's going on inside your
head
kind of inside your skull but the eye
800 pound more like you're listening to
something in the room around you so
they're noticeably more immersive
feeling in this particular application
leading us finally to answer that
original question are they worth it
don't be stupid
I mean if you can't afford to blow
nearly a grand after taxes on a pure
luxury item one that has inherent
lifespan limiting flaws that I'd love to
see addressed in an i 801 or something
then no they're not worth it but I sure
wouldn't kick him out of bed for eating
crackers either you know who else I
wouldn't check out a bed for eating
crackers
