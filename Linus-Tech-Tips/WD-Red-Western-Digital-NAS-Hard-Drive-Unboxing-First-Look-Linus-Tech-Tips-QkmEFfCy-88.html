Western Digital red series hard drives
so this is a five pack that actually
only has four drives in it for a very
specific reason and I am extremely
excited about these drives and this hard
drive packaging you look at this it's
like see it's flat pack and then it
comes with perforation so you can fold
it which makes it fit perfectly in this
delightful little box sorry guys I get I
get pretty excited about packaging these
things you know packages really get me
excited so we've got four three terabyte
WD red drives so what is a red Drive
let's start with a little bit of history
of WD and their whole Drive colors thing
I'm actually going to take it out of the
anti-static bag so cameraman can
actually see the drive so back in the
day it was just WD caviar these days we
have three well from now four but we had
three different colors so we had black
which is high performance we had blue
which is a balance between performance
and power consumption and as well as
saving a couple bucks versus the black
drives and then we have green which is
optimized for storage and energy
efficiency and then they've also got
velociraptors as well but that's sort of
it's like black on steroids so let's
call it that 10,000 rpm so this is all
all the consumer three and a half inch
drives okay so where does where does red
fit into this red is for NASA and store
oh right there's sorry there's Ari of
course as well which is the premium
enterprise level drives so WD hasn't
really had a drive in the past that is
optimized and and with with the perfect
firmware and the perfect hardware
solution for consumer storage so they
had our II which was optimized for
enterprise or business storage but was
very expensive so so many consumers were
running out and buying consumer-level
green or black drives or Blu drives and
putting them into these nas and closures
or putting them into raid arrays and
there
because they wanted to build themselves
a workstation on the cheap and they need
like a high-performance storage solution
for video editing or whatever else and
what was happening was due to the way
that consumer desktop drives handle
error recovery so error recovery is
built into any drive out there and the
windows standard is that you wait at
once there's an error once the
controller detects an error on the drive
whether it's being read or written from
the it should wait and it should try as
many times as possible to recover that
error before giving up on it so that's
the desktop standard raid controllers
work off a completely different standard
and once the drive stops responding and
is trying something like this for even a
couple seconds at a time it'll drop it
from the array so that's why consumer
drives are not optimized for raid
performance because what happens is once
they run into some kind of a problem
they'll try as long as they can to
correct it which will drop them out of
the array and makes them not ideal for
raid or Nazz or storage applications so
red drives completely alleviate that
these are using enterprise grade
hardware but at a lower performance and
lower power consumption level than the
enterprise drives because they're
running at a lower spindle speed so they
are using a high quality binning process
which means these are 1 million our mean
time between failure drives they also
come with a longer warranty than the
standard desktop drives that's a 3-year
warranty and what another part of the
whole bidding process that goes into
these drives is the fact they are
optimized for multi drive use so when
you have one drive actually this drives
a perfect example because it's a 10k rpm
Drive and you have one drive sitting in
a drive bay spinning around and the read
heads removing all over the place
there's there's vibration no matter what
there's always vibration you can't get
away from it however when you take four
drives and you pack them in tight next
to each other and they're all lie
braiding you can run engine problems
because the vibration from the one drive
and the that's above and the vibration
from the drive below and if you have a
bigger enclosure potentially the ones on
the left and the right can make this
Drive like moving around like this so WD
red drives in the bidding process have
much much tighter regulation in terms of
the amount of vibration that's a
out while the spindle spinning and while
the read heads and write our out while
the heads are moving around inside the
drive that means they are besides being
more reliable and running cooler they
are less likely to cause interference
with the other drives around them next
compatibility WD actually validates the
drives outright with many nas and
closures including this exact one which
I keep pulling up because this is the
one that I'm going to be installing
these drives in and testing them in and
WD is using not only at the chipset
level but also at the finished goods
level with guys like Hugh naps and ology
to ensure that if you buy an as and you
put a WD red drive in it it'll work
period if you guys have ever run into a
RAID controller or enclosure
compatibility issue in the past you know
what I'm talking about
sometimes they don't work and sometimes
the not working isn't as simple as not
detecting outright sometimes the not
working is more like it works for a
while and then stops working so that's a
that's you know much much much bigger of
a problem um I think that pretty much
covers everything I wanted to say about
it for now
so in summary it costs a little bit more
than a consumer drive performs a little
bit less than an enterprise Drive
however you're going to run into a
bottleneck at the controller or Gigabit
Ethernet level you know if you're
running multiple drives long before
you're going to run into a bottleneck at
the 5400 rpm drive stage it has a longer
warranty comes with 24/7 phone support
so you can call WD anytime and it is
pretty much the perfect drive for
storage applications for the general
consumer and that is why people are so
excited about this drive right now thank
