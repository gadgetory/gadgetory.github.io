between the h100 I the all-new liquid
cooler from Corsair and the original H
100 so I have built myself a little test
bench here and I'd like to explain my
methodology I'm going to keep things
pretty simple
both of these coolers are going to be in
their stock configurations so that is I
used the original course our fans for
the H 100 and I'm using the all new
updated corsair fans for the h 100 i
remember these are based on their static
pressure series fans so they should
perform significantly better at least in
terms of fans and that's not even
counting accounting for any of the
improvements that have been made with
the increased diameter tubing as well as
the pump and the block I don't think
they've actually made any changes to the
radiator so I want to show you guys my
test config really quick there's a GTX
580 in there x79 board with a 39 60 X I
believe 3930k must be a 3930k 3930k in
there got some power supply we got a/c
70 case so this represents I paste with
fairly good airflow so I'm making a
couple assumptions here I'm assuming
that you know gamers configuring their
machine for you know gaming have a
decent graphics card and I'm also
assuming that gamers configuring machine
for gaming have bought it themselves a
decent chassis especially as they're
planning to put an age 100 or an age 100
I into their computer so let's go ahead
and yeah I wonder if this is going to
work
I haven't actually turned the system on
yet so there's only one way to find out
for sure and CPU rememory change ah one
to run setup okay
so we're gonna run setup and I am going
to make some changes to the
configuration of this system so now
first things first is I am going to
adjust the CPU ratio and we are going to
clock the CPU at like 4 gigahertz or
something so not not very high not very
high I mean one of the things that kills
me about the marketing that Corsair does
for coolers like the H 100 is they give
you these numbers at stock speed on a
CPU
I'm like well yeah but that doesn't even
allow it to differentiate itself from
some of the some of the crappy or
coolers that it gets compared against so
what we really need to do is we need to
go and find AHA turn our video you know
let's just leave that alone okay so all
we really need to do then is turn up the
CPU a little bit that's not going to
affect heat much though then we're going
to go ahead and we're going to find our
CPU voltage which I can't even find and
we're going to crank that baby up so
we're going to actually put some voltage
into the CPU to help separate the men
from the boys when it comes to these
coolers so let's go up to a sort of one
point three seven five volts and see how
this six core processor is handled by
the h 100 versus the H 100 I now it's
very cold in this room it is 13 degrees
in this room right now 13 degrees
Celsius that is accurate and that is
being measured at the Corsair logo at
the intake of the case so what does that
mean I am going to be correcting the
results to 20 degrees Celsius sort of
approximately room temperature the
reason I'm doing that is because I want
the results to be somewhat comparable to
what you guys will achieve at home now
before you guys sort of run in cry foul
and say well what is it's such a cool
room so you know the results are there
no no it doesn't work that way the way
it works is whatever temperature I get
if I get sixty degrees on the CPU and I
want to correct 220 then all I do is I
add six and a half degrees to my results
trust me it scales exactly linearly
linearly there will be no issues so
we're going to go ahead find out how
things go I'm going to just boot off
that vertex SSD in there that you guys
can't really there you go now you can
see it boot off that and get into the OS
and see how things go off right right
right right okay so I'm going to do two
readings and I'm not I'm not going to
crank these things I'm going to use them
the way I would use them so on sort of
middle settings there we go to set it to
middle settings with the fans plugged in
to the motherboard so we're using
actually no no no let's call middle
settings we're going to apples to apples
here so middle settings on the one
hundred mill settings on the one hundred
I idle will be at the desktop with the
CPU idling and load will be running
twelve instances of prime95 on the CPU
with fur mark running on the GPU so that
things will heat up as much as possible
I'm going to close up this case so that
we get a
realistic scenario as well all right so
I'm starting to take down some data here
guys I'm just sort of making some notes
on my standardized heatsink test bench
since I've never really had one before
methodology wise it's going to be pretty
simple so besides the corrections that
I'm doing so these are my raw numbers
here these are my corrected to 20
degrees numbers I'm going to make notes
for which fans I'm using I'm going to be
switching to using standardized fans on
all coolers rather than using the stock
ones that come with them that way we can
eliminate the factors of you know crappy
fans that come with some of them I mean
from my perspective anyone spending 50
60 bucks on a heatsink should probably
be buying decent fans for it as well
methodology wise I'm going to be taking
the highest court or the second highest
core temperature and real temp GT and if
there's any fluctuation so you can see
here that when you open up real Tim TG
there's some some movement they kind of
move around a little bit I'll be taking
the higher of the two so if this was the
second highest core I'd be taking 27 not
27 not 26 so just kind of look at it for
a while and well saw it hit 29 for a
second there let's see if the
temperatures change in the room because
that's a factor no it's still 13-point
and I'll be rounding up the room
temperature as well so rounding up to
the nearest half so yeah you know what I
think we'll probably have to go with
I'll give it a little while longer
because you got to give these water
coolers especially you got to give them
some time for the water to heat up that
might have been just an anomaly though
so anyway there you go so I'm going to
take down some data here get the idol
and load for the H 100 and the 100 I and
we'll see how it goes
so let's torture test time now guys you
can see we're getting up near around 60
degrees and the GPU temperatures are
still climbing so once everything seems
kind of maxed out I'll probably give it
a few more minutes here well yeah I'll
definitely give it a few more minutes to
get maxed out then that'll give us some
idea of what our load temperature is
going to be for the system this way so
this is different from how I've always
tested coolers in the past where I've
always tested them in on them on an open
platform now we're going with a closed
case I mean a well ventilated case mind
you but a closed case
and this should give a more realistic
representation of how it will perform in
the real world something that I've
noticed already though is the fans have
automatically ramped up so it'll be
interesting to see how the h100 reacts
compared to the H 100 I when the going
gets tough it's quite a bit louder
already all right so it's gotten a
little bit warmer in the room but like I
said we're going to correct our results
so it should really matter that much
amazing how sensitive this thing is I'm
standing in the way and the temperature
goes up a half a degree it's just crazy
so I'll move away from it when I take my
reading but the H 100 is in there now
you can see the big fat 3/8 inch tubes
compared to the 1/4 inch tubes of course
their link is plugged in via USB there's
no hardware button to select a medium
fan profile this time around so I'll be
using the software to do that I've
updated to the latest firmware so the
fans don't rattle so you can see there's
the radiator and this is something I
really don't like about the the fans
Corsairs including I mean here so you
can see that they have a rounded shape
to the frame so what that means is that
around the outside of a square object
like a radiator see that you don't have
a seal see with a conventional square
frame fan you put it down on here and
you haveyou have a seal so you don't
have air leaking whether you're in push
or pull it's an issue either way because
it means like here let's say for example
it's in pull the fan cannot draw air
from anywhere other than through the
fins whereas if you had gaps here here
here here here here here and here then
it could draw air from around it which
would see right there see in gaps like
right there which would obviously not
help draw air through the radiator so
that's a situation we're running into
here where there are actually gaps where
air can escape around the outside edges
so I'm not a big big fan of it I mean
they're small but but it's all
significant when we're talking about
optimizing pressure through a radiator
so I've just got a go ahead and close up
the side panel then I can take my idle
temps and my low temperatures I don't
know if I ever showed you guys the low
temperatures with the H 100 but you know
they were good which is what I've come
to expect from the
hundred cuz it's an awesome cooler so go
ahead and dial that down up got real
tempera in here got my SkyDrive opened
up there we go so low temperatures could
were corrected to about 70 degrees under
load so that should be when we use air
cooling heat sinks they'll they'll
pretty much probably either boom I guess
we'll find out what happens so here we
go so we have our results 58 degrees on
the hottest core I'd say once again it's
actually a touch louder than the
original h100 I so let's go ahead and
close that down go back to our 58
degrees however it is about three and a
half four degrees cooler than the
original h100 so I'd say they're very
similar but this kind of stands to
reason guys I mean was I really
expecting you know some kind of huge
revolution in terms of performance no I
mean you still have the same surface
area you're still going to be limited by
the fact that that's your radiator
that's your cooling surface area so
we're getting what appear to be probably
better fans because they are more
pressure optimized although they do have
that slight leakage and especially with
the stock firmware they have a bit of a
rattle but don't worry once you upgrade
the firmware on your age 100 I it's fine
and the process took like a couple
minutes but the biggest benefit that you
get is Corsair link software so of
course their link allows you to do all
kinds of very cool stuff and if it would
load up for me here than I would be able
to show you that go ahead Oh
another cool instance is already running
that's why it's not loading there we go
as far up Corsair link here it is in the
background so you can do so much cool
stuff so check this out so your fans you
can set all kinds of different modes and
profiles such as quiet performance
custom fixed rpm default whatever else
you want to do you can group things so
that you can have different zones in
your computer react differently you can
actually rename them you can control
different kinds of pumps although this
is VH 100 pumps so there's not a whole
lot here to be controlled you can see
graphs of things like g-force
temperature for example
you can see the h100 eye temperature 1h
100 I pump you can see all kinds of
different stuff you can lay out the
console however you want to monitor your
different groups so of course our link
very very very cool stuff
you don't get it with the original age
100 I think that pretty much wraps this
up thank you for checking out my video
on the Corsair hydro series H 100 I and
how it compares to the original H 100
