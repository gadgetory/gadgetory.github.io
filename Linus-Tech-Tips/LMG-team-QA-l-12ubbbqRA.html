sir Linus media group whatever Q&amp;amp;A video
in this video I posted a thread on the
forum and then post it on Twitter and
had all that kind of stuff and had
people ask random members of the team
questions grabbed questions from that
list on the forum and then went around
asking everybody what the I don't know
the questions ask them the questions and
they answered the questions it's
relatively simple concept this is a Q&amp;amp;A
let's get started
the Coolermaster mastercase 5 lets you
make your mid-tower pc case your own
with a variety of modular parts and
accessories click the link in the video
description down below to learn more
oh yeah I definitely Drive the pink
Civic and I wouldn't say that I get more
attention than I'd like I mean I'm the
kind of person who goes and puts my face
all over the internet for 2 million
people to you know watch me do
embarrassing crap or yeah driving around
in a pink car is the least of my
concerns I we would love to do more
factory tours it just really depends on
what brands allow us to tour their
factories like there's a lot that goes
into the planning and the approval
process and all that because not that
many brands actually want to show off
what goes on behind the scenes you know
if there's anything less than perfection
from a QC side that reflects poorly on
them so I'm talking to a few people
right now
maybe expect to see something within the
first half of next year but yeah we
definitely want to do some more factory
tours they hang out a myth here so the
RSI is a lot better I've been using a
Powerball lately you can look it up it's
like a little gyroscope it's very
powerful it gets spinning really fast it
exercises every single muscle in your
forearm and I've been using that at
least once a week also working out helps
a lot and also I changed my mouse to
something that is more ergonomic I can
work and get back to work now
well founded in Australia that's were
originated and it never been there and
then it made its way over here to Canada
with the Australian people and I started
to mimic it from those Aussie folks
those lovely chaps but I don't know I
just used to live where there's lots of
Aussie people at the ski hill so I
thought their accent was cool so I tried
doing it myself subconsciously pretty
much any accent I just subconsciously
started talking like that in my own head
if I'm around somebody long enough ah so
that was a great deal the 8 SSD array
back when I bought it would have been
considered a smoking hot deal because I
got the SSDs which were like a car
easy blowout price with a promo on top
of it and I bought it at my staff
discount which was way lower than what
we were selling them for it doesn't
happen very often and I paid just under
a dollar per gig for about a terabyte of
SSD storage and then on top of that I
bought a RAID controller card for about
five or six hundred dollars so the whole
thing came to about 1,500 or about a
dollar and a half per gig for storage
that was faster than anything that came
out for like three to four years after
that we have received some negative
feedback due to Linus's antics in the
past but my response is always like if
you sponsor this channel that's what
you're gonna get and then don't really
hear much back and they usually keep
sponsoring the channel so um yes I'm
going to do more videos on the channel I
have a Meccano GK 15 whatever coming up
robot and I'm also going to do the fly
Kleiss scooter sort of a thing it's got
a powered electronic wheel in the back
which is both of them are actually
spoiler alert kind of disappointing and
then other robot videos I have planned
for later as well you know basically
robots like robots whenever I have time
dog there's no plan just winging it
every day keeping it fresh keeping it
fun keeping it real
those are the only things that we plan
on doing at channel super fun and doing
your best every day reaching for the
stars try and hard to do the best job
that you can do at what you're doing
ah uh basically that what else can you
what else can you say I don't want to
give you some plan like you have you've
got a 5-year plan it's actually really
structured out there's a whole graph and
pie chart and pie graph and pie
something I don't know I didn't even
know I'd be doing this last year what do
you think I'm gonna be doing next year I
don't know I could be doing something
crazy so keep your eye out for some
crazy stuff just go down
Taron dog right now we use Windows Movie
Maker obviously it's just it's the best
because it comes with Windows so that's
very convenient I think that was all I
wanted to say about that do I find
myself becoming exhausted from video
editing not really it's it's exhausting
in a different way right because you're
sitting down all day yes we can stand up
and down with us up desks mostly I found
myself sitting down and what I'll do is
um every time that I finish a video I
will set it to render and then I'll go
bother Brandon I'll stand up and I'll
walk around and that helps a lot in fact
I kind of want us to get a little bit of
like light workout equipment so we can
just like do some pull-ups or something
like halfway through the day you know
that'll keep you like it's less tiring
to move your body you can start to feel
your muscles just degrade if you don't
use them yeah I do have a personal
YouTube channel it's it's dumb you won't
like it
it's just about how premier is missing a
lot of features and has a lot bugs and I
just complain endlessly about all of the
problems with premiere some people find
it very enjoyable there's also a
tutorial three and a half hours long if
you want to watch to that on that
channel you know check it out if you
want
I guess if you're into premiere who
would be the best settings forward Media
encoder for outputting videos are the
presets because they already exist it
takes no effort if we stop doing
sponsored content we would not be able
to pay anyone so all the channels would
pretty much die honestly I think that's
something that's always come pretty
easily for me because for one thing I
used to work for a retailer so every
video I ever did was effectively
sponsored like I got paid a paycheck to
make the videos so really nothing has
changed in that regard to me insurance
you know it's Squarespace now or
whatever but it's it's all basically the
same thing and then number two is that I
follow the valve principle that they at
least say if not necessarily following
through on it all the time and that's
that you can't lie or try and deceive
the internet because if you do they will
catch you and they will never forget so
I've always taken that very seriously
it's it's even if I was a dishonest
person what would be the point of trying
to keep that from people because they're
just gonna catch me and it's gonna make
it 10 times worse when they do I don't
really have plans to be sponsored for
csgo right now but there might be
something in the works in the near
future it's unlikely that there will be
a video with me rapping in it again
although I may sing again at some point
I do have kind of an idea festering in
my mind for a music video that I'd like
to make at some point what guys laugh
that's a mystery
every morning I come in and I changed
for chess I changed the all those file
to China I need to send in all the
script and three Transco South footage
to them and then I start shoot setup
green screen and light
and shoot and added fast as possible and
I added all of those I get this question
every day it's grand Twitter periscope
yes I got a bad right after the vote and
do I like the pad yes
thank you for the bullet well to find
dropped okay yes I have um but I've
never damaged it because of the drum
I always caught it so I've never
actually successfully dropped again I
held my personal cam my Blackmagic
camera over a candle once to dry off
water and it burnt a little bit of it so
don't do that kids I think it's a good
thing like the entire camera market
especially for DSLRs for video has kind
of was stagnating for a little while and
the mirrorless cameras give you the
ability to do so many different things
that you can't do with DSLR and
companies like Sony are actually pushing
the camera industry forward
unlike Canon who are I don't really know
what they're doing but they're not
really adding much to the current market
Wow tips for starting your own business
that's a great question um the answer is
really different depending on a lot of
different factors like I was at this
talk that Gary Vaynerchuk was giving and
some guys like can you help me save my
business I bought a a small free to
distribute magazine and we're struggling
and Gary Vee is like I'm sorry to hear
that man
you got to have a good you have a good
business idea and that if you do than
the advice that I can give is go all-in
because otherwise if you accept failure
as a possibility then I think that
leaves that's just an excuse to allow it
to happen I think keeping our opinion
out of the sponsorship spots is really
about maintaining an appropriate
expectation with the sponsor I mean
whether it's a Corsair or
it's a Intel or whoever else they
understand that our editorial content is
separate from our advertising content
and it always will be and as long as
they know that going in then when and if
they complain hey you know um the answer
is well that was our opinion so TS and
you can either continue to advertise
with us and get access to our gigantic
audience which by the way we wouldn't
have if we didn't give our honest
opinion about things or you cannot and
that would be find him and so far I
think we're at like 95 plus percent
sponsor retention so they've all decided
that us being honest with our viewers is
more important than you know us always
sugarcoating everything look Colton hey
what's up question for you it's question
what are you doing your average day at
work I manage the company emails I reach
up to new clients and I manage old
clients I'm an Account Manager and uh I
do a lot of other random crap - how do
they get to copyright strikes on the
channel as a very good question um pure
stupidity I would say doing probably
doing a bunch of them in a day yeah I
just mixed a mixed one I mixed two of
them up you know like one month span so
luckily I still have my job to get a job
here what happened was - posted a video
saying that he was looking for an
assistant I was currently in school and
looking for a part-time job he was
looking for part-time hours so I was
like hey this might actually
legitimately work and I live relatively
close to where I would be working so I
shot in a resume I was not the most
qualified
he was looking mainly for someone to
shoot and edit things I had literally
never filmed a video using any device in
my entire life and I had never edited
any video on any system in my entire
life but just like kind of faked it by
showing him still shot images that I had
taken and then put my computer on my
resume my computer was mineral oil
cooled fish tank you probably
find it in the video up here someone
will put it up there yeah so he brought
me in more just to like talk to the dude
that made a mineral oil computer than a
serious interview but then hours later
the video interview finally ended and I
somehow got the job so here we are I do
not think that leaving school to work at
this company from the start or whatever
was a bad idea I think it was a good
idea I don't think that it would have
been a good idea for everyone in similar
scenarios we had a pretty good base to
work on and it was still a huge gamble
sometimes I do wish that I just stayed
and actually got my degree being that
far in and then not getting my degree
was a little bit frustrating I do kind
of plan on maybe going back and
finishing off an engineering engineering
degree at some point in time but yeah I
don't think overall that it was a
mistake I do definitely think it was
right to go with this company I enjoy my
job and it's going very well
but yeah I would like to finish off the
great assembly so my decision to pursue
tech as a career really happened by
accident I mean I was really passionate
about games and gaming so I started
doing things like upgrading computers
and then from there I just really liked
it and in a very short period of time I
went from being a gamer who tinkers with
his computer to make his games run
better to really being a computer
tinkerer who ran games periodically even
though I'm not very good at them as an
excuse to have a hot rod in computer and
I'm really not sure exactly how it
happened but part of it came from my
passion for helping people of things I
was actually a member of the NCIX tech
tips forum with like six or seven
thousand posts or something along those
lines just from just to talk about any
excuse to talk about computers it was
someone wanting to pick a video card or
someone wanting help reformatting their
hard drive I was like yeah I can talk
about computers if I type an answer to
this question so it just kind of
snowballed from there
I got kind of good at it and Here I am
today squirtle is still alive and
running I actually have a lot of new
parts for squirtle not all the new parts
for squirrel that I want but quite a few
of them a big part of the reason why we
haven't had an update on it is that
well one the plan changed I'm now
actually going in a case not just going
to be on a test bench I have the case I
have a lot of the other components but
two three I don't know whatever
we've been plugged with videos for the
holiday season the holiday season like
October November December are all our
busiest months so probably in the next
couple months after CES we will maybe
hopefully see another squirtle update
there will be another squirtle update
it's a little different having to share
my office because I will got very used
to being alone over the like probably
always that year and a half that I
worked alone but it's actually really
nice having a close-knit team and being
able to work with John in the same room
is actually really helpful we bounce
ideas off each other we work on things
together he helps me out I like to think
that I help him out I like working with
the team I like the team floor aspect I
like the idea of new companies or a huge
group of people work in one area so I've
got one working on it maybe there'll be
more people in the future so here I have
two major things I usually take care of
one of them is benching um there's
usually when I'm benching stuff I'll try
to choose a number of tests based on
what exactly isn't trying to find out um
sometimes I'll do synthetics or
sometimes I'll do like a load test to
test things like he power draw that kind
of I've um recently I started doing
stuff more inside the case I would get
um the other thing that I do a lot of
obviously is riding of the may try door
for fast as possible I also do some
writing for LTP as well on deployment
you know sometimes if I get a topic that
I know a lot about I could just kind of
go
it's willing the problem a couple
debuffing wrong sometimes I'll choose a
topic based on oh if it's more technical
thing that I bring onward because really
you're just presenting the results but
there is a little more to it than that
have some information about what your
practice is that what I try to do is
find a way to make the numbers
meaningful interpretive somehow say this
is fake I'm also the one who makes all
the graphs for the video so like you
know I try my best to come up with a
with a good conclusion David
besides that I do like some general sort
of tech support stuff around here
nothing but yeah that's pretty much what
I do here and I hope I answered your
question thanks for checking out the
form so the OTT forum today
I would view it as kind of a little bit
stagnant in the public eye I'm going to
say public eye specifically because this
is the Alpha forum and this is the
currently viewable public forum this has
been being worked on by a little bit
myself not much though largely
cat with a smiley face kernel mortis and
blade of grass and this will be being
pushed out to the the main site actually
relatively soon if you're on YouTube
maybe by the time you see this video but
we've been saying for a long time now is
in the suggestions for features thread
and all that kind of stuff like hold up
we're waiting for the new forum this is
it this is the new forum so we will
hopefully finally be implementing some
really cool stuff that we've been
wanting to for a really long time for a
camera videos I hope I do a lot more I
want to have a bunch of ideas that I
want to do and stuff I want to try as
for NAB I hope we go I'm like 90% sure
that we will but we'll see the exact
URLs of my youtube intuition as well
twitch is relatively easy it's twitch TV
slash loop underscore LAF are on there
every Friday after the land show I do a
game stream and usually on Sundays I
like to do an editing stream where I
edit something
from my personal YouTube channel and on
other random days I usually play games
or edit videos or even 3d print things
sometimes my youtube channel I just
recently got a custom URL for so it's
youtube.com slash c / Luke laughs
reignier
on there right now I'm just kind of
throwing stuff at the wall and seeing
what works so I've got an ice bucket

vlog I'm planning on trying to get to
