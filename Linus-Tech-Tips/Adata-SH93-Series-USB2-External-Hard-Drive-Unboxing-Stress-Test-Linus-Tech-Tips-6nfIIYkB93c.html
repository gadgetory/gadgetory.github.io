superior sh9 3dep that is a two and a
half inch external rugged hard drive so
we're gonna have a look at just how
rugged it is once we open it up with a
three-year warranty software download
available for it snap-on design for the
USB cable and is waterproof apparently
and shockproof okay you have my
attention let's go ahead and open this
up and find out just how waterproof and
shockproof it is I can tell you guys
right now though don't buy one of these
and leg throw it on the sidewalk because
by shockproof I am sure that they mean
shock resistant because no hard drive is
shockproof
no matter what you encase it in here we
have a user's Quick Start Guide plug the
thing in the thing okay got it
next we have it's got like like a
rubberized sort of soft touch coating on
it it's got some sort of weight to it
but it's not super heavy either this is
the what they mean by their little
unique way of storing the cable um ah
there it is
cool so there's their little rubber
covering so all you do is you plug the
cable in there so you can carry the
cable around with it plug the other
cable into the other thing here I'll
show you the instruction manual in a
nutshell alright let's just in all
seriousness folks so we'll just take a
closer look at it so there you go that's
what it looks like not kind of a hard
plastic here got kind of a soft plastic
here around the edges is quite a bit
mushy ER then around not the edges and
that is for a very good reason that is
because if it falls on a corner for
whatever reason at least it'll have some
absorption of the shock although like I
said I wouldn't
justtake thing and like for Pao you know
throw it at the ground or anything like
that so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the superior
sh9 3 it's available in a variety of
capacities and whatnots it's more about
the enclosure and less about the
particular capacity of drive that
happens to be inside and don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos now I said not to do this but
slick insisted that I do this and we are
going to test the ruggedness of this
particular hard drive
the actual drive we're gonna go test it
now
we'll find out if it is immune to Skyrim
means okay plugged in oh hold on don't
look on screen okay
well I might actually need to be
formatted
are you looking over there there it is
change drive letter and paths actually
we should make it s for Skyrim or F for
fus-ro-dah
all right hold on I'm not content until
we've actually copied something to it
well there you go it works recessed oh
and look there's an active activity
indicator LED don't forget to subscribe
