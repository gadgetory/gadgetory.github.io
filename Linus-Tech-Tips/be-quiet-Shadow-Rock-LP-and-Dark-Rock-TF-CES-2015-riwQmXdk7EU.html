brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX
alright guys welcome to the be quite
sweet we'll be checking out to different
coolers but first if you notice behind
me there is the silent bass 800 a case
that was recently featured in Linus's
silent build guide if you haven't seen
that you should probably check it out
it's a pretty cool video but back to the
heatsinks the first one is a shadow rock
LP a low-profile cooler which sports a
very impressive 130 watt TDP level it
has four six millimeter heat pipes and a
120 millimeter pure wings to fan which
rocks in total a pretty impressive 25.5
maximum DB in terms of noise which is
probably going to make it lower than
many other components in your computer
especially if you have a graphics card
there's a three year warranty and
features a dual heatsink design as well
which is pretty cool and this thing will
be really good for something like a home
theater computer or if you just have a
really small computer in general
something to note too is that they have
a nice revision to their mounting design
where you can actually feed a
screwdriver through the top of the
cooler instead of trying to work around
it which I massively prefer the next
cooler we've got is the dark rock TF
which supports a 220 watt TDP if you're
one of those guys that thinks bigger is
better six six millimeter heat pipes and
to 135 millimeters silent wings fans now
if you remove the lower silent wings fan
you can support some pretty tall memory
as that is where it's gonna go over top
of the memory it has a three year
warranty just like the previous cooler
and other than that it's actually fairly
similar it has the same kind of dual
heatsink design it just looks like they
kind of scaled it up a lot and then
added a fan in the lower compartment it
is a fairly large cooler but again like
I said if you remove that lower fan
you'll be able to have much better RAM
compatibility so it shouldn't be a huge
problem
both of these coolers should be
available sometime around March if
you're interested in getting them and as
they're both pretty alright you might be
anyways thank you guys for watching if
you want to see all the rest of our CES
content be sure to stay subscribed -
tech tips and thank you to Phantom glass
for protecting our phones for this trip
and I'm gonna keep on calling this out
because I'm pretty excited for it but we
have a cool video with them coming on
later on sometime I think during this
trip Nicola correct
if not and also Kingston's HyperX
YouTube channel they're getting close to
a hundred thousand subscribers they
released a lot of really cool like
gaming style content should be sure to
check them out as well thank you guys
for watching I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
