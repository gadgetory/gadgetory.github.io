the lucid logic Hydra engine and so that
is the chip on this particular
motherboard this is the MSI 878 fusion
and you can see I have one 5870 and one
geforce gtx 480 you can't really see
that but it says 480 there I assure you
does and I am running these in here we
are will bring up the hydrologic engine
control panel so I'm running them in in
enable hydrologic sand I'm actually
running them in X mode now I'm just
going to show 3dmark vantage um but one
I just want to talk briefly about the
advantages and disadvantages of Hydra
first of all the advantage is that it
allows you to run to nvidia cards
together for a performance increase on
an AMD chipset which is what we're doing
here I actually ran those numbers as
well it also allows you to run to ati
cards either in crossfire mode or in
hydrologic smod and then you can also
run to mixed cards from completely
different manufacturers for a
performance boost so it gives you that
flexibility another thing it allows you
to do is take cards from completely
different generations like a fifty eight
hundred and fifty seven hundred and run
those together for a performance
increase very cool stuff now the
disadvantage is that you do depend on
the drivers from lucid so that's where
you're going to get support enabled for
whatever games you want to run with this
particular configuration so it's not
going to work in everything and
compatibility was a wee bit spotty
according to my testing but here you are
I'm going to launch Vantage and I'll
show you it actually does run and you do
get a tangible performance boost cut
into cool here it is here is the
evidence that it does actually work
check this out we are in X mode dx10 you
can you can disable this little badge
here obviously well not obviously but
you can you can do it and so it'll say a
mode or n mode when you're in the
various mode so here are the two cards
and I'm not cheating see there's no
other system here there's a lot of other
parts probably systems worth of parts
but you see you can clearly see that
one's not plugged in
and you can clearly see that these
graphics cards are not plugged into
motherboards neither is that one so not
not that one either at hard drive
clearly not plugged into a system so
there's no wizardry going on here it is
actually working so i'll show you the
score a minute so there you have it if
you ever wondered what would a gtx 480
plus a 5870 score in 3dmark Vantage
there it is about 18,000 points so just
for some context the scores that I got
compared to this are about 14,000 3d
marks for an individual 5870 14,000
minute for about 14.5 about 15,000 for a
single 480 and then I also got a score
running 24 80s of about 19,000 so you
can clearly see the four ideas a little
bit more powerful than the 5870 and then
when you add them together you get
something that's a little bit less than
2 480 so it's a seems to work pretty
well advantage although my conclusion
about the technology as a whole is that
the driver support isn't quite there yet
but it looks very promising and very
cool at this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
