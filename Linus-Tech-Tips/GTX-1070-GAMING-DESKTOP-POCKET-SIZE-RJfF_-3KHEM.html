to you by synergy and the Corsair one
you can check them out at the link in
the video description so we are here at
the Silverstone booth with a product
that I have been freaking excited to get
my hands on for about the last five
months the bad news for Silverstone is
that their product isn't actually it
theirs is an accessory for it so this is
the AR VZ 0 for this is a prototype case
for a new form factor that asrock has
been developing called micro STX and the
objective with micro SD X is to take
well small form-factor gaming PC's and
bring them even smaller than ever before
so you can see right here this box is
not much bigger than what you might
expect to find like a you know
integrated graphics type PC inside but
when you open it up you've got your
front i/o you got your you know your
Ethernet your a couple USB ports and oh
wait a minute wow that is a beefy power
connector isn't it yeah that's right
when you open this thing up you will
find a full socketed quad core Core i7
processor two sodium's slots and yes my
friends that is an MX M based graphics
card in this case it is actually a gtx
1070 so we are looking at full desktop
grade graphics performance in an
enclosure that frankly isn't that much
bigger than some of the ridiculous
graphics card designs that you'll find
on the market now the bad news is that
right now this form factor doesn't have
a ton of support in fact the only way to
get your hands on one of these MXM
graphics cards is to go on eBay and try
and find one or in the case of those
guys call up a buddy over at one of the
manufacturing plants that makes them but
they're hoping that with enough consumer
interest we could see full-fledged gtx
1070 dt x 1080 even gaming pcs that are
not much bigger than what you could jam
into an oversized pocket so thanks for
watching guys and a huge shout out to
synergy for allowing us to be here at
Computex 2017 you can save 25% on the
software that lets you share your
keyboard and mouse between multiple pcs
at the link in the video description and
a huge shout-out to Corsair who's
showing off the Corsair 1 they are 12
leader gaming PC that's available with
up to a GTX 1080 with a 1080 TI model
coming soon and you can check that out
at the link in the video description as
well so don't miss any of our Ponty
decks 2017 coverage by making sure
you're subscribed and I'll see you guys
again at the next booth or outside it as
it were</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
