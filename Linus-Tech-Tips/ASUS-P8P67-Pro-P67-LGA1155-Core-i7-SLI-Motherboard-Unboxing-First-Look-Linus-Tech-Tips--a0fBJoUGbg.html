unboxing of the asou speciation x' now
since kind of the P 45 P 35 days has
really represented a fantastic value and
usually means dual graphics support so
why don't we dig a little bit further
into this one and find out what it has
to offer so first we have the most
precise digi+ vrm so that means digital
voltage regulation we have Bluetooth
built in as well as USB 3.0 built in it
has a UEFI BIOS which means you have
full mouse control over the bios versus
the older style where you use only the
keyboard to input we have SATA to our
SATA 2 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second ports
on this particular board over here we
find out just what kind of a board this
is so it features the Intel P 67 chipset
which means you have full support for
the Intel Core i5 core i3 and Core i7
processors on LGA 1155 P 67 also
supports all of the overclocking
features of the K series and
turbo-boosted processors unlike H 67
which does not support them however also
unlike age 67 it does not support the
onboard video on these processors so
let's just see if there's anything else
on the back here four ports in total
four USB 3.0 that's good more about the
Bluetooth more about the ultimate turbo
processor energy efficiency all around
you can pause that if you want to read
that I suppose and I think that's pretty
much it for the outside of the box let's
have a look at the inside
Wow the board's right on top look at
that but I'm not gonna let you see it
just yet I am going to make you guys
wait and we're going to look at the
accessories first so this is nice check
that out USB 3.0 internal header I hate
those pass throughs and then we have
four additional USB 3.0 ports for the
back of the case we have two SATA 2
three gigabit per second cables and two
SATA 3 six gigabit per second cables a
little please note there is nothing
physically different about those cables
other than the color we have an i/o
shield we have an SLI bridge
we have front Q connectors for the front
panel case plugs as well as one front
USB 2.0 we have a users guide for digi+
vrm as well as the Bluetooth and then
finally we have a full users guide for
the motherboard and a Seuss sticker as
well as a DVD which you should
completely ignore throw away and
download the latest drivers and
utilities off of the a sous website here
we have an anti-static bag which
contains a motherboard so this looks an
awful lot like the deluxe version of the
board that I've had the pleasure of
tinkering around with and I'm quite
impressed by so why don't we just start
in the middle of the board where the CPU
socket is so this as I mentioned before
is an LGA 1155 socket please do not try
to install your LGA 1156 CPU in there it
will probably break the Mord and the CPU
here we have cooling for our digital vrm
which I'm just going to see if I can
count one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten
looks like ten plus two phase power
going to the CPU so that's pretty good
for digital and then let's see moving up
we've got our eight pin power connector
exactly where it belongs in the top
left-hand corner of the board we have
our CPU 4 pin connector here we're using
the quick install a Seuss style ddr3
modules module slots so that means that
this side does not open and close you
just open up the one side slide in the
module to the one side close it and clip
it in here's the memo okay button so the
memo okay button I actually had to use
this for the first time today and what
you do is with the system off instead of
pressing the power switch which this one
unlike the deluxe version I'm tinkering
with does not have an onboard power
switch so instead of using the power
switch you press the mmmokay button it
boots up the system with a safe setting
for the memory so you'll be sure to post
every time it does work here's our 24
pin power connector and it's ideal
location along the right-hand edge of
the board and moving down to the storage
oh no nope not storage yet USB 3.0
conveniently located in the front of the
board while rather the front
of your case so if you have front panel
USB 3.0 this is a great place for that
love it here is four ports of sad a
three six gigabit per second two of
these are running off of the Intel
chipset two of them are running off of a
third-party chipset these four are SATA
to three gigabit per second and those
are also running off the Intel chipset
moving down we have our front panel so
that's your power switch reset switch
power LED here's three USB 2.0 front
panel headers so that's a total of up to
six ports or six devices here we have
our front firewire as well as our front
audio out PCI Express slot lay out
pretty happy with this one you can see
it has seven total expansion slots which
I always appreciate because six
especially if you're running dual
graphics simply isn't enough in some
cases you can see right here we have one
two three PCIe 16x Lots although please
note only these two are going to run at
anything resembling 16x if you're
running a single graphics card you want
to put it here for full 16x operation if
you're running 2 and this is a
limitation of the p67 chipset unless
you're putting on additional chips such
as an NF 200 these are going to run at
8x + 8 X if you install a third they
will run at 8 X 8 X + 4 X and bear in
mind this 4x is going to be coming off
of not off the PCIe lanes on the CPU
directly but rather through the
Southbridge well it's kind of an archaic
term now but I'm going to call it a self
bridge because I'm lazy and so it's not
ideal for graphics card use although
it's fine for something like a RAID
controller or a really high-end network
card we also have two PCI slots and I
pretty much agree with the placement of
them because if you have two PCI Express
graphics cards that are both dual slot
remaining you will have one PCIe 1x slot
up here you will have one PCI slot and
you will have one PCIe 4x slot so that's
a pretty good mix of expansion options
on a more value oriented board nice to
have that one legacy PCI slot available
too so we have two dedicated ps2 ports
one for keyboard one for Mouse we have
digital audio out in both flavors
optical as well as coaxial we have one
two three four five six USB 2.0 ports
one eSATA one powered eSATA two USB 3.0
ports
Gigabit Ethernet as well as 7.1 audio
and here's something to note as soos is
actually using the Intel Gigabit
Ethernet that is included on the chipset
I believe it does cost them more to
license it so most motherboard
manufacturers put on third-party chips
including a soos on previous generations
but now they are using the onboard
Gigabit Ethernet which apparently has
great capability so thank you for
