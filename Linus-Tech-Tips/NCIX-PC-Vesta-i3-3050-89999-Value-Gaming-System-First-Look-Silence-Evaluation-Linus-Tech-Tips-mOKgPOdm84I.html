should I buy where should I buy it from
what graphics card would you recommend
for this game and this video is sort of
meant to be a couple of things it's
going to be the answer to a lot of those
questions and it's also going to be a
bit of an introduction to to a gaming
system that NCIX says probably most of
you know I work at NCIX the computer
store here in Canada and this is a
gaming system that NCIX is going to be
releasing for back to school because as
you know students only focus on their
studies when they go off to university
that's the only thing they do they never
use their computers for gaming never
happens okay so what I have running here
is furmark so this is just a test on and
I've done a lot of features on the MSI
cyclone series of coolers but we're just
going okay first I want the cameraman to
come over here and just get close to
this computer just get close we're
listening to it so you don't have to
worry about what you're pointing it I
have a novice cameraman today so on the
point is this computer is very very
quiet even under a full gaming load so
it's using a fractal design define our
three case that means you've got a front
door on the case here which has a nice
kind of a brushed matte finish on it
inside we've got a DVD writer we've got
room for another optical drive the r3 is
slightly revised so it has kind of these
cool five and a quarter inch Bay covers
that have a little little hinge here so
you can just lock them in just like that
you've got a couple of removable fan
filters on the front so it's populated
by default with 11 20 millimeter fan and
when we open up the inside you'll see
that NCIX installs the three and a half
inch drive behind the fans so that it
gets optimal cooling you've got all your
sound dampening materials here behind
the door just want to have a quick look
at that so the define our three is
basically like the define our to which i
unboxed quite some time ago and it was
first released in north america so let's
run around here and have a look at the
back of the system so it has a 550 watt
power supply it's powered by an MSI
motherboard which features USB 3.0 and
you can't see it but on the inside it
actually has SATA 6 gigabit per second
to so not too as well so that means that
you've got all of the latest
technologies on this particular system
and why don't we open it up
and have a look at the inside so the
target price of the system is going to
be about 899 Canadian and what that
means is that you get a dual-core
processor it's only going to be a core
i3 but as most people know when you're
gaming at high resolution HD resolutions
usually the CPU is not the bottleneck
and it usually comes down to the GPU so
that's why we focused more on putting a
very very powerful graphics card in here
and building the system around that now
this is an sli ready motherboard so it's
going to be also available in a
higher-end configuration where you're
going to add one more gtx 460 upgrade
the power supply a little bit to make
sure that it's sli compliant as well as
throwing in a quad core so that'll be
kind of like a deluxe package anyway so
on the inside you see we've got a
standard ATX motherboard for gigs of
kingston ram we've got the dual core i3
processor even come close even with the
side panel off i want you to listen to
the system it's still quite quiet so
even when you're gaming you don't have
to worry about excess noise and you can
see the GPU runs out of cool 62 degrees
peaking at 66 even with the case closed
and never goes over about seventy six
percent fan speeds so even if we turn
off after burner so let's do that and
cameraman za phone is going off here so
there he turned it off good work okay so
when we turn off after Runa you're going
to see it's actually going to get quite
a bit quieter still and as I mentioned
before we have the hard drive so it's a
one terabyte hard drive no I believe
it's a 500 gig hard drive no it is a one
terabyte hard drive by default install
down here at the bottom you can actually
install up to eight hard drives in this
case so with all of the expansion
options on the board you've got six
theta 2 ports to say 236 gigabit per
second ports so you're probably going to
use one of those for your DVD or blu-ray
drive and then you can have up to six
hard drive supported directly off the
motherboard go ahead and look at the
motherboard don't worry about looking at
me all the time so you can see now that
we've turned off we've turned off the 3d
application the system is darn near
silent even with the side panel off and
you can actually get the NCIX
technicians to make some changes for you
to you can get additional fans installed
because the
are three does support an additional 120
millimeter or 140 mm fan on the side
blowing onto your graphics cards you can
see that it's covered with a noise
dampening material by default but you
can just take that right out you can
actually put an additional 2 120 or 140
s in the top and then you can put an
additional 120 millimeter fan in the
front so if you don't care about the
silent aspect you can actually make this
case all about the cooling performance
instead now speaking of fan filters
you've got an additional 120 millimeter
on the bottom that one's filtered and
then the power supply uses a
120-millimeter fan on the bottom of the
power supply and you can see that's
pulling air through a filtered fan hole
right on the bottom of the case again
more fan filters more case airflow and
it make sure your power supply stays
nice and cool so this is a system that
we're pretty proud of for 899 so check
it out I think this is the first time
I've ever really done a video on
something that NCIX does on PCs even
though that's been a big part of my job
for about two years so I get a lot of
questions to on my blog about what
exactly is my job well that's one of the
things I do I responsible for making
sure our PC configurations are up to
date well engineered and well thought
out and that you get sort of the right
config for the money so thanks for
checking out my video blog and I hope
you've enjoyed this little feature on
the silent aspects of this particular
NCIX pc one other thing I wanted to
mention really quick I talked about the
noise dampening material inside the case
but I want the cameraman to kind of
demonstrate just how much of an impact
it has so this is that Idol so this is
if you're just editing Word documents
are actually doing schoolwork you know
on the internet or whatever so hopefully
the cameras microphone is close enough
to the back here that you can hear some
noise coming out the back of the case
and then I want the hold on don't move
yet but on my mark I want the cameraman
to move the camera away and just kind of
sit it next to the side panel where
there's noise dampening material
so what I'm hoping is that on the
YouTube video you'll be able to tell
that that's quite a bit quieter and we
might as well have a look at the front
panel connectors to which we didn't look
at before so you got headphones
microphone USB e-sata power and then
inside here hidden is a little reset
