doing a temperature in acoustics
comparison between the reference GeForce
GTX 560 Ti and the seuss direct Cu 2
GeForce GTX 560 Ti and since I had so
many requests to also include it I will
be including the msi gtx 560 TI twin
frozer 2 version of this graphics card
so this will be a 3-way roundup i'm
going to be using fir mark yes i know it
is not a perfect temperature and load
testing application for geforce cards
because they will all throttle down when
running fir mark it is a software patch
that nvidia has implemented to keep
users from burning out their cards
however since we're comparing three like
GPUs they're all geforce gtx 560 t is my
theory is that they'll all ramp down
equally so we will at least be able to
compare these three cards against each
other both in terms of load temperatures
as well as in terms of noise so for our
stock reference cooled card we're
looking at a load temps of about well
not about exactly 75 degrees Celsius
once it levels out since our room
temperature is about 24 degrees Celsius
we're gonna round that up that means we
have a delta of 51 degrees Celsius so
I'll do all the audio clips at the end
but just to show you guys how loud they
are but the stock fan actually doesn't
ramp up very high in terms of the
overall fan speed so it remains fairly
quiet
now the direct cu2 is significantly
louder than the stock fan but i think a
big part of that is because the fan
ramps right up to about 2400 rpm but the
good news is that with its hybrid of
like a straight heatsink and then you
see those heat pipes coming out there
and then like a fin heat pipe design
where the one fan is blowing at the
heatsink and the other fan is blowing at
the heat pipe thins they actually
achieve significantly better
temperatures than the stock cooler so at
61 degrees
in a 24 degree room that is a delta of
only 37 degrees compared to the stock
cooler which is significantly better all
right so our room is closer to the boat
that almost 27 so we'll call it 26
degrees in our room right now it's
gotten warm from doing from running fur
mark on these video cards it's not a
very large office that I have as you can
plainly see alright so with the Twin
Frozr - we're looking at low
temperatures of 50 yep okay we'll look
over here low temperatures of 57 degrees
focus focus there we go 57 degrees so
when we take our room temp really wow
it's going up really fast now so 27
degrees and I will call it call it 26
because that's what it was before
okay so 57 minus 26 gives us a 31 degree
Delta and there it is yeah 26 it's just
air currents in the room right now so
you guys got to understand that all of
these results are only going to be
accurate to within a couple degrees
Delta because it's not a super
controlled environment you can see my
temper o'the is generally positioned at
the intake of the fans so yeah pretty
much there they're fairly equivalent I'd
say in subjectively the noise from the
Twin Frozr - is pretty similar to the
noise from the direct see you - but I'll
leave that for you guys to judge with
the audio samples at the end don't
