sought to time IQ yeah okay so this is
it Christmas party 2016 and I have a
very special announcement for the
Christmas bonus for this year in
previous years the way we've done the
Christmas bonus has been pretty
different everyone has gotten the same
thing for the most part phone plan trip
to Mexico that was a work occasion there
ended up being something we'll never do
again
ah don't feel me
so this year instead of trying to come
up with a one-size-fits-all we have
actually tailor picked different
Christmas bonuses that we think will
suit the tastes of the individuals that
make up Linus Media Group as diverse as
they are much better than what we've
done in the past but there's going to be
a twist for your hat please why I need
it we are going to be doing it Secret
Santa style Oh little do they know that
while all the boxes are designed to look
different they all actually contain the
same thing a late 2016 model 14-inch
razor blade gtx 960 notebook boo yeah
that's not not go boom
mass drop is currently featuring the AKG
M 220 semi-open Studio Headphones at
$49.99 a hundred and ten lower than MSRP
check it and other drops out at the link
in the video description people work at
LMG are pretty smart so if we want to
pull one over on them we're gonna have
to do more than just put laptops inside
boxes of different sizes so we've got
some different packaging like plastic
style packaging like this that we're
going to throw with pillows or like
batting materials same thing with this
plastic wrap your right here the most
important thing is for people to not
know that all of the gifts contain the
same thing because I want to see the
squabbling as they steal presents from
each other thinking that one might be
good than the other don't know what they
all okay okay so you guys have until my
