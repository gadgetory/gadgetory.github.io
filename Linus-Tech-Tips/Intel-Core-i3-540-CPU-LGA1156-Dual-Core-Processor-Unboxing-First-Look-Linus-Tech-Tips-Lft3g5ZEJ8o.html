and Core i5 dual core processors Intel
has made their product line potentially
one of the most confusing out there
today
but I'm going to try and clear that up a
little bit so today I've got the i3 540
so this is the faster of the two i3s
that are available at launch and what
the i3 540 is is it's very similar to
the socket 1156 core i7s and core i5s
with a couple key differences first of
all an i3 500 series is a dual core
processor with hyper threading okay so
it has four logical processors even
though it only has two physical
processors this actually provides some
real-world benefit in terms of any sort
of multi-threaded tasks that you're
going to be performing like video
editing stuff like that okay
what it doesn't have compared to the new
dual core Core i5 600 series is turbo
boost and turbo boost is an incredibly
important feature for the core I series
processors because it takes that stock
frequency which in this case is 3.06
gigahertz and in some case it boosts it
up as much as three speed bins depending
what you're doing with the processor
okay so that's one reason to go for a
core i5 500 series versus an i3 are
sorry 600 series versus an i3 500 series
now when you step up to the core i5 700
series the difference you're looking at
is you lose hyper-threading but you gain
two physical cores so that's a quad core
processor so even though it doesn't have
hyper threading it's a much faster
multi-threaded machine compared to the
core i5 600 series which are dual cores
with hyper-threading and compared to the
core i3 I think I've rambled enough now
I think the point should be pretty much
this the core i3 is a core series
processor that has hyper-threading but
no turbo boost okay there we go let's
just open this thing and be done with it
okay so inside we're going to find hard
Intel warranty card installation
instructions and intense
logo label so there's your little core
i3 sticker that you want to stick on
your case or wherever it is you want to
put it then inside we will also find a
cpu I'll have a look at that later and a
heatsink now I can't believe how wisi
intel has made these heat sinks I mean
like seriously for reference here's the
heatsink on a 5750 like a low-end video
card you look at that that's like the
same size pretty much might even be
bigger on the video card so I mean
something that I've recommended to a lot
of customers who are buying a low end
core i5s and i3s that come with this
heatsink is to just grab an aftermarket
heating just got a cheap one like an
Arctic cooling freezer 7 programs - it's
a great little heatsink and it'll
perform this especially if you want to
do overclocking now that's not to be
down on the Intel engineering team
because a big part of why you can use
such a small heatsink on this processor
is because it is so efficient it uses
very little power it outputs very little
heat and it will not die under the
cooling of this little tiny fan heatsink
it's just that if you want the best
temperatures and again if you are
overclocking or pushing the limits of
your processor then you want to make
sure that you throw some better cooling
on it that's all so here you can see the
core i3 itself like I said before this
is a socket 1156 chip or LGA 1156 I
should say so that means that on the
bottom of the chip you'll find 1156
little pads that will make contact with
your motherboard
okay now also launching with the core i3
and the new core i5 dual cores are the
age 55 motherboards now the biggest
difference okay between an H 55 and a P
55 is support for onboard video but the
onboard video is not actually on the
motherboard
it's on this chip so the new dual cores
all have integrated video processing
units right under the heat spreader
there so that means that if you take a
core i3 or a new Core i5 dual core and
you install it on a p55 board it will
work but the p55 board won't have
support for the integrated graphics chip
that is on this processor so you won't
actually have a VGA
port to plug your monitor into our DVI
port or whatever else you need likewise
if you take a core i7 1156 chip or a
core i5 quad core and plug it into an H
55 board you'll have those ports on the
back of the motherboard like a DVI port
but you won't actually have a graphics
processor on the CPU to drive it so it
won't actually work so that's another
tidbit that is really interesting about
the new core i3 and Core i5 dual cores
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the core i3 540</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
