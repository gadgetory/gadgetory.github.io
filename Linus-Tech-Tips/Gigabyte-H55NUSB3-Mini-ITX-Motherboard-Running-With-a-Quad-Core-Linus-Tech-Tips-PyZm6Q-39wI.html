would have thrown an overclocked
quad-core on the the poor and gah 55 n
usb3 from gigabyte that's that ITX board
that I was overclocking on a dual-core
but what I did decide to do is throw a
quad core on it and then just run prime
over a course of a couple of days and
see how it fares so you can see the
temperatures are unreasonably high up to
98 degrees on some of the course and
that really comes down to the the core
i5 CPU cooler not being adequate really
and my room being quite warm after
sitting in this tiny enclosed space so
by the time the room really heated up
well you see then it gets pretty hot so
I mean really if you're running this in
a little tiny ITX case like say for
example this one then you're gonna want
to make sure that you're you're using
some kind of decent cooler it might just
be that I have bad contact with my
thermal compound but actually you know
what that's not maybe it either way okay
so I'm running eight threads of prime95
what CPU is this
hold on it oh okay well this is a
quad-core but I don't think I'm allowed
to talk about this one yeah I'm not okay
okay so I won't talk about it anyway
eight threads quad-core it's been
running prime for a grand total of let
me see how long it ran for for 56 hours
49 minutes the board didn't blow up so
that really completes my experimenting
with the age 55 in USB 3 it held up
admirably in a room that must have been
well over 30 degrees at its worst with
just a stock cooler with poorly applied
thermal compound and the MOSFETs and the
board itself did not explode so very
nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
