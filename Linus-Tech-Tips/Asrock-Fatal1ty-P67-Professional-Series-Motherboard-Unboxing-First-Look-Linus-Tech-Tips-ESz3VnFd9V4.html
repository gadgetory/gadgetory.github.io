been reawakened this is the p67
professional motherboard and it features
a picture of Jonathan Wendel on the
front as well as the fatality logo now
I'm just kidding but it actually feel
all it does have that what it actually
figures features is Intel's p67 chipset
it features a digital pwm design a 16
plus 2 phase CPU power delivery
mechanism it has a fatality mouse port
what is a fatality mouse port
let me see so uh after plugging the USB
mouse into the fatality Mouse port and
running Xtreme gamers can use fatalities
personal preferred most polling rate at
500 Hertz ok
neato next we have support for 6 USB 3.0
ports to front for back and 6 SATA 3 we
have three pcie 2.0 slots supporting
crossfire X and SLI so that is in 3-way
crossfire X and up to NVIDIA Quadro I
mind you buy Quad SLI they mean dual
dual GPU cards in two slots we have
premium gold cats all the capacitors on
the fatality P 67 Professional Series
gaming motherboard our luxury premium
gold caps these 100% Japanese made solid
capacitors are sleek high-gloss caps
with a premium gold coating representing
long life and stable performance so you
can see here we have a window into the
box where we can see the motherboard
itself let's go ahead and have a look at
that on our camera man wants to look at
the board ok that's ok we're gonna open
it off camera now ok so we can have a
look at the back of the board where they
actually call out wow they actually do a
fairly good job of summarizing the
features of the board I'm not going to
look at it now what I'm actually gonna
do is I'm gonna open it up and I will
use the box as a reference as I'm doing
my usual guide of the board
so first let's have a look at the
accessories that we have here let's just
figure out the packaging I've opened a
few motherboard packages in my day so I
think
can probably handle this there we are
okay accessories here we go so we have a
fatality setup guy may we have a
fatality
no way okay this is a quick installation
guide it's this thing that's a finger
for perspective so this must have a lot
of different languages one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven different languages so the
English section actually only goes to
season 10 Wow geez so they're guiding
you through I guess a whole lot of
different stuff on this particular
motherboard we've got a driver oh oh
this is nice this is handy so they give
you all of the pin outs of all of the
important connectors on the board and a
nice little color diagram here and they
clearly label them all that's a nice
touch I actually really appreciate that
right inside the front cover because as
someone who's installed a couple of
motherboards in my life that's usually
the only thing I'm looking for inside a
motherboard manual
so here's p67 professionals so download
the latest off tality website I guess I
actually don't know you don't know what
guys leave a comment I'll leave a
comment on the video if you know what
website to throw away the disk and
download the latest drivers from please
okay here we have a USB 3.0 back plate
bracket all right we have an i/o shield
that is conveniently color-coded and
labels the fatality Mouse port right
here okay next we have look at this IDE
and floppy cables
it features IDE and floppy go figure
all right here we have some SATA 3 6
gigabit per second cables although I can
tell you right now there is likely no
difference between these and any other
SATA 2 cables but there you go they're
certified just in case you were
uncertain we have a molex to SATA
connector power adapter brother we have
an SLI bridge yep that's a lie bridge in
there next we have front USB 3.0 oh I
get it how this works so you can
actually decide whether you want to use
be conveniently included three and a
half inch bay front USB 3.0 adapter or
you can take the bracket in here install
it in one of these and have two more in
the rear that's actually a really clever
really
simple solution I haven't seen that
before all right let's get to the board
itself hold on I'm gonna make some room
for a cameraman to be able to get around
here and see it so they profess one on
all series board from fatality so let's
take in the overall look at this board
you know what they've done a fantastic
job with the red and black color scheme
black PCB you know what the gold
okay the gold plated caps for all their
excessiveness actually look really cool
as part of the color scheme of this
board like come in and check check those
out not actually that actually looks
really neat okay so let's do our overall
tour of the motherboard starting with
the CPU socket as I usually do so here's
your LGA 1155 socket so bear in mind
this has support for intel core i3 Core
i5 and core i7 processors only on LGA
1155 socket it does not support onboard
video because this is a p67 motherboard
you'll need an h-60 7 motherboard for
onboard video or a z68
here is the 16 + 2 phase power design
that is around the CPU socket that's
going to deliver nice stable power you
can see here that all of these heat
sinks are actually swept back to provide
a nice clear CPU heatsink mounting area
so you should be able to mount pretty
much anything you want on a board like
this up here in the top in its ideal
location we have our 8 pin CPU power
connector moving along to the right
we've got for ddr3 dual channel slots so
these are using easy installation slots
which means you only have to clip in the
one side so we've seen that on it suits
motherboards as well as MSI motherboards
in the past here we have a 24 pin power
connector and exactly its ideal location
and we have an IDE connector and if I
did have an IDE connector on my board
this is probably where I would want it
because I would probably be using an IDE
optical drive up near the top of my case
this has a lot of theta connectors I'll
tell you guys that much so here we have
our SATA 2 so these are the 3 gigabit
per second connectors and then we have 6
SATA 3 6 gigabit per second connectors
so these guys right here
are running off of the Intel chipset and
these ones are running off a third-party
chipset you can see here there's a
little notice for better performance and
short boot up time we suggest you
connect the hard drive that is your boot
drive on ports 0 to 5 as your boot
device of these guys not these guys you
can use these for other additional
things all right let's keep moving down
the board and don't worry we're gonna
get back and have a look at the the
heatsink cooling solution on this board
in a moment so here we have onboard
power and reset buttons as well as a
post readout LED love these these are
very handy when you're trying to
diagnose a dead Ram stick or a dead
video card or something like that moving
down we have our front panel connectors
we've got a ton of fan headers on this
motherboard you can just hook up like a
whack of fans one two three four five
six six fans that I can see and I think
that's I think that's all we got but
that's pretty darn good okay we've got
one two three four four USB 2.0 front
headers one USB 3.0 front header then
we've also got a floppy connector for
whatever reason we have that I don't
actually know in terms of our you never
know you might need it okay so we've got
our PCI Express layout looks pretty good
so far because this is a high-end board
I actually really like this layout so if
you're using a single graphics card
they're assuming you're putting together
a build that might just still have a
legacy PCI card so you're gonna go ahead
and use this guy if you're using dual
graphics in a motherboard like this hey
odds are pretty good you don't need any
PCI so you can go ahead and still make
use of this PCIe 4x slot even though
it's a physical 6 X you can actually see
it's only wired up to 4 X you can make
use of this piece yet you 1x slot and
this piece yet you want X slot giving
you 5 useable PCI Express slots total
even if you're using a dual graphics
card configuration now the cooling on
this board is done in a pretty neat way
so you've actually got very low profile
heat sinks on the chipsets and then
you've got higher profile heat sinks
connected via a heat pipe to those that
are actually going to receive quite a
bit of incidental cooling from whatever
CPU cooling solution you're using so
you're able to cool the chips
and keep everything very flat on the
board which is convenient for installing
graphics cards so you don't have
anything in the way of these clips or
anything like that and then you can
actually do the cooling up here and keep
it all centralized in one place so let's
go ahead and oh I missed the firewire
port sorry there's a front firewire port
as well in this guy alright moving along
here back panel connector we've got
dedicated ps2 ports which I actually
like I still like the ps2 port you never
know when you'll need it we've got a
clear CMOS button optical as well as
coaxial digital audio out 4 USB 3.0
ports on the back panel 4 USB 2.0 ports
dual Gigabit Ethernet
we've got firewire eSATA as well as 7.1
audio out now I'm actually just going to
because they list there because they
list their odd their their features so
neatly on the back of the motherboard
box I'm actually going to go ahead and
tell you guys if I missed anything so
yeah we've got full support for k-series
unlocked processors which I did not
mention before and I think that's pretty
much it I covered it pretty well then
good on me okay yeah supports up to ddr3
2133 dual channel on these slots so
