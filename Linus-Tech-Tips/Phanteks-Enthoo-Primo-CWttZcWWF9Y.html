the fantex enthu primo you guys have
been asking me for this for a while and
here it is we're going to start with
packaging it comes in a box which you
may or may not have expected it's also
got some nice soft closed cell foam
because of how heavy this case is and
especially how heavy it's going to be
once it's laden with hardware like man
this thing's heavy I wouldn't have
minded say a little bit thicker foam
like what Silverstone does on some of
their higher-end cases but it should
pretty much arrive in one piece even
with a system inside in most cases let's
start with the accessories inside the
little accessory box the sets included
you get a radiator bracket so this
allows you to install up to a dual 120
millimeter radiator on the side if
you're willing to remove the hard drive
cages don't worry there will still be
SSD mounts you also get a nice little
kit full of screws it's got little
compartments for all the different kinds
of screws that come with the case
actually it's amazing how many different
kinds of screws are used on this case it
actually has more than the ten
compartments worth of different screws
which I discovered when I undid the this
thing right here the reservoir mounting
bracket that was actually inside in the
first place because it was unfortunately
useless if you have a gaming grade
graphics card that's sort of a normal
length then it's going to interfere with
that anyway the good news is that there
are other places that you can mount your
radiator without any difficulty finally
finally we've got the rest of the
accessories here we've got two little
foam pieces in case you want to install
a second power supply in the enthu primo
and then some zip ties as well as two
more velcro straps in addition to the
ones that are inside the case so let's
start with the outside the front of the
case actually I didn't really like it
that much before it was powered on and
before had an entire system in it it's
got a gorgeous brushed aluminum finish
now this is a bit of a double-edged
sword because it looks great out of the
box but if you get fingerprints on it it
can stain over time so just make sure
you're careful with it it has a blue LED
strip illuminating not only the front
but also the top and then if you remove
the front cover it
we got two blue LED fans that give a
very pleasing glow to the front of the
case as well the great news about all
these LEDs is that you can actually
toggle them on and off with a switch
that's built into the front of the case
you've also got an extremely solid five
and a quarter inch bay door up at the
front that conceals five five and a
quarter inch bays and has a very solid
feel to it and closes with a satisfying
funk because it is magnetized so quite
like the front of the case the last
thing to note about the front is that
that removable piece that gives us
access to those fins has a removable
cleanable fan filter that's got kind of
a complex design to it you would just
guess run the whole thing underwater as
opposed to removing the actual filter
from the front piece because the way
it's constructed allows the front bottom
air vents like they're kind of the side
front bottom air vents to intake air and
still have it be filtered in addition to
any air that's coming through the front
of the case which brings us to the top
which is also gorgeous
you know brushed aluminum finish two USB
2.0 ports two USB 3.0 ports that have
little rubber you know covers on them
that will get lost immediately power
reset switch as well as that LED control
switch that controls not only the LEDs
on those front fans and the LED strip
but also can control additional LED fans
in the case there's actually a bunch of
leads I believe there's four additional
leads inside the case and it can control
control your internal case lighting
because it has a molex connector that it
powers as well so you could have your
interior lighting and you can hook up
pretty much whatever you want to it and
have the old thing turn on and off with
the push of a switch
speaking of pushing we can remove the
top fan filter just like that go ahead
and clean that or do whatever it is you
need to do with it
this also reveals a ton of space at the
top for fans and radiators you can do up
to three 140 millimeter fans or four 120
millimeter fans and because there's
enough clearance between the top of the
internals and the top of the and the
bottom of this fan filter you can
actually do a push-pull configuration
with a quad radiator in here quite
comfortably in fact the enthu Premo is a
water cooling a water coolers wet dream
so to speak because of all the options
that are available
in it so let's go around to the
right-hand side where we find not a
whole lot of much of anything there's
two 120 millimeter fan mounts these are
mostly only going to be used if you do
decide to install that optional bracket
or I shouldn't say mounts I mean to you
know holes to ventilation holes there's
also a ventilation hole for the power
supply intake the power supply only goes
in well one of the power supplies only
goes in one way in this case on the left
hand side we have two little windows one
that reveals a fan Tech's logo and
that's pretty much about it other than
that it's just kind of a stealth panel
there across the three and a half inch
drive cages and the cool thing about
that fan text logos you can actually
replace it quite easily it's held on
with screws from the backside so you
could put in whatever you want and then
a nice large sort of blue tinted window
that gives you a nice look at your not
your power supply oh yes it has a bit of
an unusual internal layout so all it
really shows you is your motherboard as
well as your graphics cards and that
kind of cool stuff so the slightly
different internally let's go ahead and
oh boy this thing's heavy I'm going to
try and move it around a little bit here
so you can see that the power supply is
actually vertical that's what allows you
to install up to two power supplies in
the case you can also put a 120 or 140
millimeter fan here the back should you
so desire there's another reservoir
mount here thankfully so that original
one that wasn't very good we don't have
to use that also at the back we've got
either 120 or 140 millimeter fan mount
you can go ahead and slide that up and
down as needed the last thing I do want
to show about the outside is oh wow it
said II got a finger even more removable
fan filter so you go ahead and click
these ones down here on the bottom and
they slide out from the side this
reveals I yes you can have up to a
triple are either quadruple 120
millimeter radiator mounted in the
bottom as well so that gives you two 480
millimeter rads both with filters and
potential for awesomeness of course you
would have to remove the three and a
half inch drive cages if you wanted to
do that now the fans that are included
with the case not the greatest you know
workmanship ever they have a bit of a
quite a bit of flex to them they don't
feel like the greatest thing but fantex
does include five of them which is
pretty generous considering the cases
large feature
and cost - $49.99 I don't usually
mention pricing but cases don't change
much so there you go the good news about
them is that especially with the
included fan controller
they are quite quiet so I was overall
pleased with the included fan quality
and quantity so there's two 140 s in the
front one 140 on the bottom a 140 in the
back and finally a 140 in the top this
is kind of funny I have an H 100 I that
I've managed to install in the system so
there's another 100 and sort of slightly
less than hundred and twenty millimeter
gap here and then there's two 120 s over
here in the five and a quarter space
there's a 140 here managed to install
that without even removing any of the
stock fans so we still have all of the
original air cooling which is sort of
funny to me the manual is great because
it gives you a couple of useful matrices
there's one for our radiator
installation so it gives you a little
checklist of where all the different
radiators fit and all that good stuff it
also gives you a little matrix for all
the different places you can put fans so
well it's not as good as someone like
Silverstone's
manuals where they actually walk you
through the entire process of building
in it I'd say it's completed not to give
you a good idea of what you are up
against now I say up against but
experienced builders really won't have
that much of a challenge the side panels
are unexceptional on the inside except
you can see that the one with the two
120 millimeter vent spots on it is
actually blocked by defaults you can go
ahead and pull that off if you do decide
to mount fans or a radiator there now
why it's not challenging us because they
actually do a lot of the wiring for you
so we're gonna go ahead and move around
to the back check this out I love the
way that fantex
has done most of the cable management
out of the box so they've got their nice
little velcro ties which are all down
here all down here for the eight pin
across here for the bottom where you're
going to run your USB to your front
panel audio and all that good stuff and
they've also got a ton of the other
little standard hoop and look loop
tie-off things that go along with these
zip ties that they've included actually
you see a ton of cable management
options but I didn't undo most of it all
I really did was I took the fans out of
here and then I routed them all here to
the integrated fan controller this can
support up to 11 fans that are all
controlled via PWM and it actually works
incredibly well more on that
a little while so I routed all the fans
there I routed my 24-pin my for PCI
Express connectors up here there's a
reason I installed two graphics cards in
the system I wanted to see if there was
going to be enough clearance here to be
able to run two graphics card worth of
PCIe cables and a 24 pin and USB 3 and
all that stuff and there was and then I
just doubled back with a couple of these
ones to where they needed to go that was
pretty much it other than that cable
management is a breeze in here and even
though I didn't do a great job of
managing things you know carefully up
the side here or laying things flat and
utilizing the back of the motherboard
tray better it looks incredibly clean
and it looks great from the front now
this is something that I sometimes feel
really good about and sometimes don't
feel as good about something that I
sometimes bothers me about Corsairs
cases is that they don't leave much room
for flexibility they come meant to be
wired a certain way and everyone's build
will look great in it and that's
fantastic but everyone's build will kind
of look the same fantex has taken that
approach with a lot of the pre wiring
but they haven't gone too far down that
path you have a lot of options you can
actually remove the three and a half
inch bays here you can actually remove
the five and a quarter inch bail though
you will need to drill out some rivets
if you want to do that and you can just
fill the bloody thing with radiators you
can you can put your power supply on the
other side you can still do things
differently it's just that I generally
wouldn't really recommend it because the
way that they have it wired up here is
quite nice
installing the power supply was like the
easiest thing ever you just kind of drop
it in there there's a lot of space to
work with next to the power supply here
unless you install a pump on the
included pump anti-vibration rubber pad
which is awesome it happens to have the
correct holes for the Lang d5 or Swift
tech mCP 6655
which is my personal favorite pump
nothing else really matters to me it's
great to see that included there's also
more room for a reservoir over here
should you so desire if you're going to
remove those three and a half inch cages
installing drives is a snap actually
they're kind of a really smart little
system here so they have two little
nubbins here and here and then they have
these wings that come out see these snap
out and then what you do is you just put
the drive on click them into place
there's no bending there's no flexing
there's no goofy stuff like that and
once you put it in it actually feels
very very solid the one thing that does
feel that solid about the three and a
half inch cages is the entire cage
assembly itself they've made it modular
so you can actually move it closer to
those two 140 millimeter fans at the
front to give yourself some more space
over here you can take them out entirely
but I feel like it could have used a
little bit more reinforcement the other
drives that I installed I put a single
two two half inch SSD in to one of their
little removable brackets here now these
little tuna half-inch brackets can take
up to two drives each but I think in a
practical sort of unless you're buying
adapter so you're going to need to make
sure you use straight cables you might
have trouble putting two drives in them
so be aware of that and then the other
thing I didn't like about these was the
fact that they don't screw in in any way
there's nice little rubber grommets that
they go ahead and clip into quite nicely
and mostly you're going to be installing
SSDs in there so even if in shipping a
drive came flying off and rattling
around it would probably be fine if you
ever put a hard drive there or if the
SSD managed to they come loose and whack
something I don't know I don't like
things that don't at least have the
option to screw in the cool thing about
this in terms of options is that you can
go ahead and you can install it here on
the back of the motherboard tray if you
want rather than over there so you've
got two brackets with up to three
different places that you can install
them moving around to the front the
amount of space in this case is just
very obvious and apparent I went what
they sort of air-cooled and then all in
one liquid cooled configuration but you
can do pretty much anything with this
thing in fact there were a couple of
really cool build logs that I found on
Linus tech tips form as well as
overclock net one where the the bloke
actually put rads in the bottom front
and top and then managed to hide all of
the tubing without even being able to
see it and then the one on the Linus
tech tips form was quite exceptional as
well and it shows the creativity that
this case does allow the fact that there
is adequate cable management room for up
to four graphics cards they do have
eight PCI slots in the back and then the
fact that you can put an e ATX
motherboard in here these are all very
very positive things and I think they've
managed to make room for all of that
without having it be full of empty space
like something like the cosmos too tends
to be in the bottom here by default you
can put a nice thick radiator or you can
actually even slip a fan in the back
here if you want and I think that's
pretty much all there is to say about a
tool is five and a quarter inch drive
cages lots of cable management grommets
and that's pretty much it for the inside
so cooling with air is actually very
awesome and this is actually it's time
to do my little demo here so check this
out guys
the fact that it includes that pwm fan
controller is really cool so I'm going
to go ahead I'm going to intentionally
let my CPU overheat by undoing two of
the thumb screws here now this isn't
something that I necessarily recommend
you can hear the system in my lab
running very quietly right now so I'm
going to go ahead and detach this and
without providing any additional power
to the adapter on the back to that fan
controller and you should check the fan
Tech's website to make sure that your
motherboard supports that I can pull
this off and listen to this
the entire case works harder to keep
that CPU cool and now when I go ahead
and pop the block back on there the
entire thing is going to quiet down
again this is an outstanding little
feature and then the add the LED control
is also fantastic as well overall what
do I have to say about the enthu primo
very solid case considering the price
the build quality is what I'd consider
to be what you would expect you can see
where they've spent money on things like
the gorgeous aluminum finish on the
front and the top as well as on the
tooling and the design that enables them
to bring all this functionality into
what is a fairly reasonable size when
you consider how much stuff you can put
into it I don't personally like the
weight and I find it a little bit
difficult to move around but for some
people that'll be much less of a concern
love the flexibility that it affords I
think the looks are going to be a
take-it-or-leave-it depending on how you
feel about the you know the the
two-tiered like kind of stepped look to
the top as well as the kind of busy and
yet black and monolithic looking front
but overall I quite like it I think it
looks much better in person than it is
than it does in pictures and videos and
it looks much better once you've
actually got a rig in it you can
appreciate the efficient use of the
space so overall definitely a thumbs up
for fantex on this one and I look
forward to seeing the end through duo or
whatever more enthuse we might get in
the future guys like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
check out the link in the video
description I talked about the price in
this video so you don't need that to
find out the price but you might want to
discuss the video somewhere other than
the YouTube comments you know wild west
