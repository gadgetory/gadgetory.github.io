touches on your brand-new gaming rig
cables organized graphics card in side
panel on and you're about to get going
fast but then what is this I'm sorry you
need what no I'll just turn all this
stuff off here we go
wait a minute some of this stuff isn't
even optional and making matters worse
this is just the stuff that Microsoft is
telling us about I mean all I wanted to
do was get some frags not join the
freakin botnet Hey
I think I know something that might help
with that oh my god Wendell from level
one text how they're going what are you
doing in my closet so long story oh you
know what no never mind since you're
here can you help me with my sponsor
spot I know but I can't help you fix
your gaming problem okay well hey let's
give it a shot
and while we're at it you know what else
is worth a shot
Origin PC Origin PC offers beautiful
custom desktops and laptops such as
their evil 15 s that weighs only 4.3
pounds and is under an inch thick
featuring smooth 144 Hertz 1080p or 4k
displays in an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070
max Q be sure to check them out at the
link below I don't know if I messed it
up because I wasn't sure what I supposed
to do so I went back in the closet
the last time I checked the graphics
driver in particular situation on Linux
was abominable and when it comes to wine
I mean any newer titles pretty much
anything requiring DirectX 10 or DirectX
11 was a total mess like has any of that
changed actually the everything you said
was wrong what we referring to as Linux
is actually news flash Linux or as I've
recently taken to calling it the new
plus Linux and the driver situation has
improved dramatically
you know both AMD and NVIDIA have put a
lot of work into their drivers AMD has
got a really amazing open-source driver
in the very latest Linux kernels and on
the wine side of the things we've got DX
VK which is a real-time DirectX
translation layer to Vulcan so you can
play games like The Witcher 3 in terms
of performance we Vegas 64 and a 1080 Ti
were competitive with one another in
some titles socially Linux titles with
Linux optimized titles natively at the
beginning of the year but Nvidia driver
updates and things like that have led to
other optimizations so it's leapfrog
give again and freesync is not quite
ready yet
in the newer linux kernel's from AMD so
that's still a little bit of a problem
with the very very bleeding edge kernels
but the situation's really changed and
improved okay so I'm gonna let you drive
because you're running an AMD graphics
card we're gonna update the Linux kernel
to something a little newer than what
who Bunty supports by default now if
you're running an Nvidia graphics card
you wouldn't need to do this but you
would definitely need to get the binary
driver from Nvidia in order to you know
take advantage of the latest and
greatest ruin your 1080 or 1080p eye or
whatever recent graphics card so we've
got the bunch of kernel upgrade utility
basically all we have to do is paste
some stuff into the command line so with
the Ubuntu kernel update utility
installed yeah we can just do UK you you
and at the time of this video I think
four point seven point five four point
seventeen point five is going to be the
most recent version for running
seventeen point four because we were
messing around the system a little bit
before but you just hit install and
you'll have to put in the password and
this is going to go and get a newer
version of the kernel
Budhan previous blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
okay now this one are we gonna do is
reboot and it'll use the newer kernel by
default so by default we've got two bun
two but if we do Advanced Options we can
see that we've got all of our kernels so
we started out on 4.15 and then we get
4.7 yep another we're on the newest
kernel we need to update the other the
other sort of side of things the kernel
gives us the driver but we also need
Mesa updates and that sort of thing so
there's another PPA for that which is an
extension to bun too so we're gonna do
the same thing and add a repository
which will give us Mesa Mesa and OpenGL
or sort of the other side of the
graphics drivers feel like you need to
bottom half for the hardware and the top
half for the software side of it for
games with the PPA installed you can see
that there's a ton of stuff that's gonna
get updated so this is all stuff that
doesn't really matter for you until X
Server org now you wouldn't need to do
this if you were just gonna run steam
games native steam games sure this is
just for wine and the xbk and getting
the bleeding edge out of that
so let's this we've got gallium 9 which
I'm not gonna install because we we
don't really need it per se but I'll
mention it because it will let you run
DirectX 9 titles it's older it's not as
supported there are other options but
this is the options that you have for
plugging stuff into wine so that you can
get more functionality out of wine so we
should probably explain what wine is for
the uninitiated wine is not an emulator
it's like an emulator but it's not an
emulator and see wine stands for wine is
not an emulator see that's the joke and
it's it's terrible I'm one is a
reemployment ation of certain windows
api's to make applications available on
linux and so you can run a Windows
application under Linux and the Windows
application thinks windows is there but
not all the windows is there you know
sometimes even windows own utilities
don't know that it's not Windows and so
you can use that to run some windows
games but not a lot and we've got Lou
trous which will give us runners or
script for scripts for running games
like The Witcher 3 okay so hopefully
y'all have been keeping up if not don't
worry we're gonna have links to all of
these sources and also to web mills
forum down in the video description so
the worst is over it actually gets a lot
easier from here so easy that I could do
it definitely really really put okay
fine okay let's just do this so we've
got loot rasol ready can you kind of
explain what Lutra sties so it's a lot
to ask a user to manage all the
different versions of wine and the
command line BS and I would agree that
that's not really the best user
experience right people have written
scripts to make it easier because when
you think about The Witcher 3 you can't
just run The Witcher 3 because you
probably also need to steam and so but
it's not our Linux version of steam you
need the Windows version the steam so
that has to run under wine or some kind
of emulation layer as well so lootus
gives you a script you just hit an
install button on the webpage and some
person has gone through the hell of
developing that before you hit install
what's that a lewd scene oh never mind I
thought that was a raised rump you know
okay so continue install this is so easy
I can do it here we go
so our steam accounts logging in and
there it is and this is the Windows
version of steam windows steam the only
thing that doesn't work under one is the
copy protection now witcher 3 works fine
with copy protection right but that's
not true of every title like Far Cry 5
interesting there it is okay The Witcher
3 Wild Hunt so I just click play let's
hope can I get a can I get a finger
cross hey there are a couple of bugs
here and there in the game but it it's
pretty much ok it's rendering you know
if I would have told you a year ago that
we could have real-time DirectX
translation to Vulcan you'd probably
call me a crazy person hey why can't I
just go into the menu in the middle of a
cutscene new modern game developers like
holy fuck what's happened with games is
that they've made far more assumptions
about the amount of cooking time that I
have like if my baby starts crying I
don't want to miss the cutscene I'm
gonna be able to pause maybe gaming
hasn't changed maybe it's me maybe I
have a life so this is really cool sore
it's our DP
kaor DX DX VK just make DirectX to
volcán total GameChanger Linux gaming is
better than ever but like come on how
many times have we heard no no really
really Linux gaming is better than ever
that's a fair point I mean if you need
something right now and you just don't
want to think about it and you don't
want to mess with the libraries you can
run a full virtual machine you can run a
full Windows virtual machine and do all
your gaming that way can I alt f4 out of
again cool actually closes a lot faster
yeah that's one thing that I've always
loved about anything that's not Windows
so why don't you tell us about using a
vm if you want to use a vm you will need
to pass through a second graphics card
okay so do we have one we do somewhere
ahh so we'll need to shut this down cuz
that's hot plug graphics cards it's not
a thing yet are you sure are you sure
I'm not did you watch my video no I
didn't there it is it's a thing if you
go it's a thing no it's a thing it's
finally becoming a thing because laptop
users need it not the enterprise which
is fine oh we should probably it
together monitor AMD and NVIDIA in the
same system this is heresy sorry you
want the other one okay so then this is
not that dissimilar to what I've setup
before with unrated so this is just Red
Hat KVM yep running in Ubuntu yep and
then we've got an extra SSD for Windows
an extra graphics card to pass through
yep and an extra keyboard and mouse
because why not because why not okay so
what do we do
we've just boot up the virtual machine
yeah the configuration we just set it up
we do the iommu groups for pass through
and we tell it the graphics card we go
into USB devices and find a keyboard and
mouse and map them and then we just let
the Machine boot up so this is it this
is just the full fat Windows experience
yep now overhead wise from what I've
seen in the past we're looking at
anywhere from as little as two or three
percent to as much as you know 10
percent or more in terms of performance
it but any is there anything else I
should be aware of about running it this
way it shows up as an AMD epoch
processor just
there is a performance it in some
scenarios but mostly it's okay some
things are faster like superposition
interesting now you got the Nvidia
drivers installed in spite of the
infamous code 43 error code 43 is a
thing that shows up when in VT Nvidia
drivers detective running is a virtual
machine so you have to set a
configuration option in the can in the
virtual machine on the Linux other
things to hide the fact that the machine
is virtualized and then code 43 goes
away right which is kind of annoying and
silly right cuz they just want you to
buy a Quadro or better right now it's
also kind of annoying and silly that
this monitor that you could use for
things other than gaming not on windows
on linux but you know it's not super
convenient so there's also a
lookingglass one of our forum members
jeff at host fission he's put a lot of
work into it I've put a lot of work into
it you may need to go run it okay oh
cool look at that how's the latency oh
not bad yeah this is a direct memory to
memory copy using the direct X capture
API so the same capture that you get so
even just then it was actually faster
than your native monitor to handle the
mug switch interests and so this way you
could run your Windows VM with full
hardware acceleration but as fast as we
can copy the frames from the guest to
the host you can run it and how do I
make it fullscreen I think there's a
command line option for that and
honestly like we don't know what we're
doing as far as OpenGL programming goes
so if there's if there's any OpenGL
programmers that want to contribute to
the project out there you are more than
welcome it's open source it's on github
what more could you ask for ah full
screen that's a command line yeah I
think I saw a hiccup there that I'm not
sure if I saw over on the other side
either yeah there will be some it's not
perfect but we're getting there
it's not bad for alpha software it's not
bad at all so there you have it I hope
this was a fun and enlightening look at
just how far the humble pain
has come in the last couple of years
guys we're gonna have links to Wendell's
channel it's level one text we'll have
that down below as well as their amazing
looking-glass software and more
information on how to get something like
this running for yourself but in the
meantime just let us know in the
comments below if you're running
something like this what kind of
challenges you've run into and if
there's any other great educational
resources that you can provide for
people who are into gaming on Linux
