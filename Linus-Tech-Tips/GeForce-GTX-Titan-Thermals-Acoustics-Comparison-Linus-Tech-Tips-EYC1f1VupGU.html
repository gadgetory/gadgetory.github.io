quantify about the Titan is its
acoustics and its temperature
sort of thing because the way that it
works you can actually set the
temperature of your card you can go okay
I want to prioritize the temperature of
my card
I'm gonna go prioritize this and you set
a temperature you can set your setup
temperature at 70 degrees it comes at 80
degrees you can set it to 90 degrees you
can move that slider around and what
that'll do is it'll actually control
itself and stay there but then wait
there's more you can actually stay there
a number of different ways you can
either stay there by having your fan
ramp up and down and that's with
controllable fan curves or you can stay
there by having the GPU clock itself
down dynamically and reduce its own
voltage dynamically in order to stay
there so the actual temperature
fluctuation of the GTX Titan is
extremely tight I mean if it doesn't
have to reach that temperature it won't
if it's already got its fan speed on
minimum it's not going to just ramped up
voltage needlessly in order to in order
to get there but what it will do is
it'll stay at or under that temperature
and it'll do whatever you tell it to do
in order to get there so what that means
is that comparing Titan against the
other cards so gtx 680 didn't work this
way because it used GPU boost one versus
GPU boost two on titan and that one was
controlled by the TVR
by the total power of the board so it
was it was a power limitation as opposed
to a thermal limitation that caused the
GPU to to ramp itself up a ramp itself
down so okay so that's that's totally
different HD 7970 works totally
differently again where it's actually
just got its own kind of profile and it
does its own thing and there's not a
whole lot of there's not a whole lot of
control it just kind of the the GPU sort
of as fast and then the fan speed ramps
up as the GPU heats up and it
compensates so so what we had to do was
we had to kind of decide where we wanted
our Titan to be so we aimed for more of
a high-performance Titan however what
you could do is set the fan to stay very
very much in control and have more of a
silent Titan so we had our fan
that kind of went like this and then
ramped up quite steeply at the end so
it's kind of a it's a middle ground but
we gave it a good 50 55 percent fan
speed at that 80 degree mark in order to
keep itself cool and make sure that the
turbo was going to be able to ramp up
because once you get that temperature
limit your GPU boost sorry I called it
turbo but your GPU boost is gonna start
ramping up so when I compare
temperatures against the reference 680
and the reference 7970 are probably the
ones to look at most carefully here
when I compare temperatures against
these cards you have to bear in mind I
could have just as easily set the Titan
to run at a completely different
temperature so look at it this way all
of our cards are overclocked 660ti SLI
7970 680 tightened and there was one
other card our other card is the Aries -
they're all overclocked
so this is what they sound like and this
is the temperatures that they run at in
order to reach the performance numbers
that we were able to reach in our other
videos so let's start with idle
temperatures without further ado the
7970 was a little warmer than the others
and everything else was pretty much the
same with the gtx 660ti is in sli but
probably honestly as probably an anomaly
in the reading because pretty much all
GPUs that have good coolers on them idle
pretty close these days because of how
advanced these video cards are and how
they actually don't deliver much power
to the GPU when it's idling so it can
run quite close to ambient temperature
low temperatures we see a different
story ares two steals the show no duh
it's liquid cooled so there's individual
blocks on the two GPUs that are keeping
that very very cool 660ti sli pulls
ahead of everything else so this is a
good opportunity to talk about reference
boards versus non reference boards for
example our 680 uses a reference cooler
which has the advantage of exhausting
the air out of your chassis through the
vents in the back but has the
disadvantage of not having an open
design like this MSI 660ti that allows
it to keep the GPU itself cooler so this
one kicks heat into your case but keeps
your video card cooler
all this one gets the heat out of your
case but doesn't keep your video card
itself as cool so you have to make the
decision do I care more about the other
components must do I have a stuffy
cramped case and I got to get that heat
out of there or do I have a big well
ventilated case and I don't care and the
other components aren't gonna get hot
anyway so do I go with more of an
aftermarket design
moving right along so low temperatures
are tight and ran a little bit warmer
than our GTX 680 but like I said before
we could have just as easily set it to
78 degrees and it would have run at 78
degrees but that's how we got the
performance we did and it ran a little
bit less warm than our Radeon 7970 now
temperatures are meaningless without
acoustics so what I what we've done is
we've set up our our test bench with a
microphone that is actually 12 inches
away from where the GPU fans were
located so shotgun mic so it's a
directional mic and we have taken sound
readings of all the cards that we ran at
idle and load as well as some reference
noises so I'm gonna play back those
reference noises I'm gonna play back
those fan speeds and I'm gonna calibrate
it while I'm editing so that the sound
of my voice in my ears is about like
listening to me talk from you know a few
feet away and then hopefully all those
other sounds will be similar to what
they would be like if you're listening
to them so there you go there's our
there's our acoustics and temperatures
don't forget to subscribe for this tech
tips from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos
this would be a normal conversational
talking voice just talking to someone
who is about 3 to 4 feet away from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
