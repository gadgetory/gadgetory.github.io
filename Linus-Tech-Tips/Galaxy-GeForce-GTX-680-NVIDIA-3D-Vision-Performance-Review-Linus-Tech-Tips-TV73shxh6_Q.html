technology so to go along with the
geforce gtx 680 launch here I've got my
galaxy geforce gtx 680 i can remove the
glasses so you guys can see what the
card looks like if you haven't already
seen my regular performance review or my
unboxing and the focus of this video is
going to be on three divisions so what
differentiates 3d vision from its
competitors first and foremost is the
fact that it uses the nvidia ecosystem
so you get a 3d vision certified display
in this case i'm using the VG to 36 h
monitor from a sous honestly if you're
buying a 3d vision set up today i would
definitely recommend going with one of
the newer monitors with light boost
whether it's the benq 2420 t or the asus
27-inch i can't remember the model of it
but it has light boost light boost makes
all the difference in the world whether
you're using gentoo glasses the ones
that look like this or generation one
glasses it definitely reduces headaches
reduces crosstalk between the two images
and provides a much brighter more
immersive 3d experience so there's
advantage number one is you got the
nvidia ecosystem that is the nvidia
graphics card the nvidia certified
monitor and the nvidia glasses means
that everything works together there's
no guesswork involved there seems to be
a lot of confusion about AMD HD 3d and
that is for good reason I've tried on a
couple occasions to get AMD HD 3d
working correctly and it can be a bit of
a bear so for one it only works
correctly over DisplayPort meaning
there's only I think about two monitors
on the market that supported out of the
box and number two is you have to get 3d
inserting middleware whereas nvidia is
actually doing the work of putting in
the driver profiles putting in the setup
wizard and getting you going in a fairly
seamless manner so what are we comparing
since we can't compare any AMD cards
because it'd be hard to do apples to
apples I want to compare the latest
generation gtx 680 against its last
generation equivalent the gtx 580
i also want to compare it against the
gtx 570 just so you guys have another
point of reference and finally against
the gtx 590 that is the ruler of the
roost from the last generation that is
basically duel something between these
two because it's got the same number of
cuda cores as a 580 but it's actually
clocked about like a 570 so that's
that's that graphics card so the 680 oh
yeah so 3d why do we need more power for
3d well for one thing let's start I've
actually already run all of the tests
for this one so I pretty much got them
here but let's take a look first at a
case study of the gtx 580 so in this
case I'm going to highlight the gtx 580
row for regular and then the gtx 580 row
for 3d vision okay so in terms of
average frame rates we see it requires
about double the processing power in all
scenarios minimum maximum and average in
order to enable 3d vision we get half
the frame rate crysis 2 we're going to
see a very different scenario where
actually 3d vision doesn't give it that
much of a hit which is something that
Crysis 2 is actually designed for with
the witcher we see this scenario again
where it takes about double the
processing power remember it's rendering
the scene from this angle and then from
this angle and then using the glasses to
show only the correct the correctly
angled scene to each of your eyes to
give you that 3d effect next batman
arkham city we see once again a huge
performance hit for enabling 3d vision
and finally with Skyrim we see the same
thing where it takes about double the
processing power so that is one big
reason why stereoscopic 3d gaming
enthusiasts might go with something like
a gtx 680 over last generation card
because da-da-da-da-da you can actually
see I'm going to highlight the gtx 680
with a green color for new nvidia cards
okay so the 680 actually performed
across the board almost on par or better
or sort of a little bit lesser or a
little bit better than the last
generation gtx 590 which if you go
recall is pretty much equivalent to two
gtx 570 s or 580 somewhere in between
that so that puts it a clear double the
performance of the 580 here in
battlefield 3 double the performance of
the 580 here in crisis to more than
double the performance in The Witcher 2
please note 20 FPS is not playable
you'll have to dial back the detail
levels one way or another this is just
giving us the relative performance and a
GPU bound scenario next we've got a
significant improvement although not
nearly as huge as some of the ones we've
seen before so 60 from 44 the GTX 680
versus the 580 and finally in Skyrim we
see it yet another doubling of
performance so while the regular
performance numbers showed the GTX 680
definitely beating the GTX 580 you do
here actually yeah I guess it's pretty
much close to double across the board
maybe I should have looked more closely
of these yeah okay oh okay Batman Arkham
City not so much haha but then again not
so much so okay what we've learned is
that if you throw more processing power
at it in this case the GTX 680 over the
previous generation gtx 580 remember
this is clocked at 1 gigahertz and that
is a flexible clock speed using GPU
boost still actually scale itself up in
scenarios where it's not using as much
power with two gigs of six gigahertz
clocked memory this is using a new 28
nanometer process it can assume
significantly less power than the last
generation gtx 580 so you can see here
oh no no sorry not not against the GTX
580 but against the gtx 590 which is
closer to it in terms of performance so
you're saving as much as 100 to 150
watts under load across the board
compared to a 590 and getting similar
performance getting similar power
consumption to the 580 and just blowing
it out of the water in terms of
performance especially as you guys can
see in 3d vision so if you want a game
in stereoscopic 3d a geforce gtx 680 is
probably not a bad choice and thanks to
galaxy for providing the gtx 680 that i
use to run these
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more unboxings reviews and oh
wow I almost forgot to mention that yes
the 680 is the first graphics card from
Nvidia to support 3d vision surround off
a single card so using DisplayPort and
then dual DVI s you can actually run
three displays in 3d vision in surround
mode off the single card and I shouldn't
say it's the first because technically
the 590 supports it because that one has
dual GPUs to power its three DVI ports
but it is the first single GPU card that
not only supports 3d vision but also
supports 3d vision surround off a single
card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
