technology so to go along with the
geforce gtx 680 launch here I've got my
galaxy geforce gtx 680 i can remove the
glasses so you guys can see what the
card looks like if you haven't already
seen my regular performance review or my
unboxing and the focus of this video is
going to be on 3d vision so what
differentiates 3d vision from its
competitors first and foremost is the
fact that it uses the nvidia eco system
so you get a 3d vision certified display
in this case I'm using the VG 236 H
monitor from a soos honestly if you're
buying a 3d vision setup today I would
definitely recommend going with one of
the newer monitors with light boost
whether it's the BenQ 24 20 T or the
Asus 27-inch I can't remember the model
of it but it has light boost light boost
makes all the difference in the world
whether you're using Gen 2 glasses the
ones that look like this or generation 1
glasses it definitely reduces headaches
reduces crosstalk between the two images
and provides a much brighter more
immersive 3d experience
so there's advantage number one is
you've got the Nvidia eco system that is
the Nvidia graphics card the NVIDIA
certified monitor and the Nvidia glasses
means that everything works together
there's no guesswork involved there
seems to be a lot of confusion about
AMD's HD 3d and that is for good reason
I've tried on a couple occasions to get
AMD HD 3d working correctly and it can
be a bit of a bear so for one it only
works correctly over DisplayPort meaning
there's only I think about two monitors
on the market that supported out of the
box and number two is you have to get 3d
inserting middleware whereas nvidia is
actually doing the work of putting in
the driver profiles putting in the setup
wizard and getting you going in a fairly
seamless manner so what are we comparing
since we can't compare any AMD cards
because it would be hard to do apples to
apples I want to compare the latest
generation gtx 680 against its last
generation equivalent the gtx Phi
I also want to compare it against the
gtx 570 just so you guys have another
point of reference and finally against
the GTX 590 that is the ruler of the
roost from the last generation that is
basically duel
something between these two because it's
got the same number of CUDA cores as a
580 but it's actually clocked about like
a 570 so that's that's that graphics
card so the 680 oh yeah so 3d why do we
need more power for 3d well for one
thing let's start I've actually already
run all of the tests for this one so
I've pretty much got them here but let's
take a look first at a case study of the
GTX 580 so in this case I'm gonna
highlight the GTX 580 row for regular
and then the GTX 580 row for 3d vision
okay so in terms of average frame rates
we see it requires about double the
processing power in all scenarios
minimum maximum and average in order to
enable 3d vision we get half the
framerate
Crysis 2 we're going to see a very
different scenario where actually 3d
vision doesn't give it that much of a
hit which is something that Crysis 2 is
actually designed for with The Witcher
we see this scenario again where it
takes about double the processing power
remember it's rendering the scene from
this angle and then from this angle and
then using the glasses to show only the
correct the correctly angled scene to
each of your eyes to give you that 3d
effect next Batman Arkham City we see
once again a huge performance hit for
enabling 3d vision and finally with
Skyrim we see the same thing where it
takes about double the processing power
so that is one big reason why
stereoscopic 3d gaming enthusiasts might
go with something like a GTX 680 over a
last generation card because
da-da-da-da-da you can actually see I'm
going to highlight the GTX 680 with a
green color for new and idiotic cards
okay so the 680 actually performed
across the board almost on par or better
or sort of a little bit lesser or a
little bit better than the last
generation GTX 590 which if you go
recall is pretty much equivalent to two
gtx 570s or 580 somewhere in between
that so that puts it a clear double the
performance of the 580 here in
battlefield 3 double the performance of
the 580 here in Crysis 2 more than
double the performance in The Witcher 2
please no 20 FPS is not playable you'll
have to dial back the detail levels one
way or another this is just giving us
the relative performance and a GPU bound
scenario next we've got a significant
improvement although not nearly as huge
as some of the ones we've seen before so
60 from 40 for the GTX 680 versus the
580 and finally in Skyrim we see yet
another doubling of performance so while
the regular performance numbers showed
the GTX 680 definitely beating the GTX
580 do here actually yeah I guess it's
pretty much close to double across the
board maybe I should have looked more
closely at these yeah ok ok Batman
Arkham City not so much haha but then
again not so much so ok
what we've learned is that if you throw
more processing power at it in this case
the GTX 680 over the previous generation
GTX 580 remember this is clocked at 1
gigahertz and that is a flexible clock
speed using GPU boost you'll actually
scale itself up in scenarios where it's
not using as much power with 2 gigs of 6
gigahertz clocked memory this is using a
new 28 nanometer process it consume
significantly less power than the last
generation GTX 580 so you can see here
oh no no sorry not not against the GTX
580 but against the GTX 590 which is
closer to it in terms of performance so
you're saving as much as a hundred to
150 watts under load across the board
compared to a 590 and getting similar
performance getting similar power
consumption to the 580 and just blowing
it out of the water in terms of
performance especially as you guys can
see in 3d vision so if you want a game
in stereoscopic 3d a GeForce GTX 680 is
probably not a bad choice and thanks to
galaxy for providing the GTX 680 that I
use to run these benchmarks
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and oh
wow I almost forgot to mention that yes
the 680 is the first graphics card from
Nvidia to support 3d vision surround off
a single card so using display port and
then dual DVIs you can actually run
three displays in 3d vision in surround
mode off the single card and I shouldn't
say it's the first because technically
the 590 supports it because that one has
dual GPUs to power its three DVI ports
but it is the first single GPU card that
not only supports 3d vision but also
supports 3d vision surround off a single
card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
