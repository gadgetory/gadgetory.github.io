powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM hey guys I'm here at the enter max
booth with Elaine we're gonna check out
some of their air coolers and she has
something very cool to show it's called
TCC the the air cooler it's actually
called T 40 the TCC is the thermal
conductive coating that we have
basically these two are the limited
edition comes in all black on the
heatsink and then all all white and the
coating it means it actually helps to
dissipate the heat it doesn't affect the
performance of the CPU cooler yeah
because the notice a lot of times
coolers will come bare no paint on them
and that's for a good reason because if
you paint them it can reduce the ability
for the cooler to dissipate heat from
your CPU so to be able to paint them
they had to come up with technology TCC
and use it on their cooler so it's very
cool we're gonna shuffle down here a
little bit and move on to their liquid
cooler now this the first thing I
noticed is this is not an ASA tech
design this is not a cooler design this
is different so what's awesome about
this I'm so basically this one it is
aluminum he's thank you as you can see
it I don't know if you can see it
clearly and also the the whole design is
a little bit different even on the sides
which is his own you can see it over
here so the style looks like this so we
have a special cut on the aluminum and
obviously everybody knows aluminum the
health helps dissipate the heat as well
and also our patent on the liquid cooler
will be the SCT it means shunt channel
technology and helps out for the water I
guess to break the water even more that
way helps to dissipate the heat even
better so have a good performance on
that
yeah so as a lot of you guys know with
liquid coolers they're trying to squeeze
the water and shoot it through they're
really really fast you don't get
build-up and don't get water about air
bubbles within the water so they're
shunt channel technology is squeezing it
through and breaking up the water so
that it'll flow and not sit there and
create air bubbles that's very cool
we're gonna move on all right guys we're
still here checking out the animatics
booth and I didn't walk past this and
saw the conus giant is a very large case
you can fit tons of hardware in it well
I think the best part is that they have
an IDE hard drive in here which is
fantastic I just that's that's kind of
awesome but you can fit a huge computer
in here you can fit to all a i/o liquid
coolers I just this thing's crazy what
do you have to say about it so basically
not just two of them it's actually two
to 40s as you can see on top right here
we have the 240 on top and then the 240
on the bottom so it can fit like a
bigger motherboard that has two CPU
slots yeah so you've got a huge
motherboard with to Seaview slots you
throw tons of graphics cards in here and
tons of the large graphics cards in here
you could throw four Titans in here no
problem it's if it's a workstation PC
you're probably not gonna throw four
Titans in it might throw a K 20 or a
Tesla or something like that but this
thing's nuts dual CPU sockets all the
RAM you could want all the graphics
cards you could want all the cooling you
could want
they have cool LEDs going through here
are these your guys's I don't yeah
they're power supplies there's a sort of
Platinum Series what wattage is this
power supply um this one is either one
1200 or 1350 that's huge and possibly
needed for this type of a system because
you can load this thing with hard drives
as you can see over here they have two
let's hard drive base where you get one
out here there we go Tula's hard drive
bays really really easy to get out
really really easy to put back in if I
can put it back in there we go that was
my bad not their bad this thing's crazy
and then you can fit like a 180 up to
180
Fenne
so it's really really big and helps out
to cool everything else get those hard
drives cool get everything else cool in
there give it a huge fan in the front
four or five and a quarter inch bays
check out this top bay right here get in
here b-roll we got all the USB - you
could want to get 4 USB 2 there 2 USB 3
power reset I believe this is fan
controllers that light control light
control okay so you can you can brighten
your fans you can dim your fans you can
turn it off you can see your levels
right there then the top there's a huge
grill up top here for your cooler I
believe you can fit one up to 140
millimeter coolers up here up to 240
that's it yeah to 140 millimeters right
to 140 millimeter fans those are 120 but
then it's got yeah okay so it looks like
okay it's one singular bigger fan not to
140 so you can fit a massive fan up
there if you come around to the back
here I know I'm throwing b-roll all over
the place but if you come around to the
back here you've got for water cooling
grommets so you can go to an external
radiator which is great I've never done
it but it's pretty cool and just the
thing's huge it's absolutely massive is
there anything else you have to say
about it awesome it's awesome and now we
are headed over there to see a case that
I'm really excited about I don't know
about her but this is definitely my
style so if we can walk over here do to
do to do BAM there we go
this case is amazing you might want to
check it out biro it's called ostrog it
only fits me perfectly Adam I just feel
so this case um last year we came we
came up with normal awestruck so it's a
black and the mash you contributors like
different colors so this year we decided
would you do something for the girls so
we came out with the really cute light
pink not for me so the mash here is
white and also the inside right here we
painted white tube so all these coating
is actually pretty like a little bit
more expensive than the black one
obviously part of the painting and the
job and the you know the work that I
need to do but our al stress being
selling really really well so hopefully
you know limited edition for special
edition in all seriousness this might
not be the case for me but as some of
you may know the keyboard that I just
bought for my mom is has a white shell
and pink keys with white backlighting so
I might get this for my mom because it
would suit that keyboard so well and
having your whole PC setup all
synchronized is a very cool setup so I'm
actually happy to see a limited edition
case that has some interesting colors on
it because what you usually see come to
market is will be a limited edition case
it has red accents like okay well is
that really limited edition or you can
make 10,000 of them because it's red
accent so you can sell as much as you
want so it's interesting to see a bold
move like this and thanks for showing us
two cases we're gonna move on to another
product line now so stay tuned alright
guys we just saw those awesome cases now
we're gonna cover some awesome power
supplies with as well as many as you
know you don't need actually that much
power drawers you did before because
haswell's very low power very power
efficient so fanless power supply is
becoming much much more realistic and
enter max has a 650 watt fanless power
supply there's also some other really
cool stuff about it so I'm gonna pass
off
so pretty much this is our finless power
supply comes with 550 550 550 so
basically that's right now I think the
highest wattage on the market
um and it's plenum level which is more
efficient energy efficient um so this is
all fully modular as you can see and
right here the design is very elegant
and we have diamond cut aluminum so all
of this is made of aluminum which you
know it also helps to dissipate the heat
as well aluminum is great at dissipating
heat as she said the diamond cut part
looks really really sharp I'm actually
just gonna pick this up really quick
here for one second as she said fully
modular which is absolutely great it's
just you can see all the ridges that
they cut into it which looks absolutely
fantastic none of those super cheesy
looking stickers like we've seen on some
power supplies just very very clean very
very good-looking power supply and I'll
saying earlier you don't need that much
power for newer systems you can fit a
780 and a has well it like a 4770k a 780
have a awesome machine just maybe don't
go overload on the hard drives and SSDs
and stuff just a couple if you keep it
fairly low cut you can get away easily
get away with 650 watt fan this power
supply with a very sharp looking quiet
system that's fantastic let's slide on
down the line here so now you're getting
a little bit more aggressive you need
that wattage you've got a you've got
that same system we were talking about
before
4770k 780 whole bunch of hard drives
whole bunch SSDs you're going nuts
you're overclocking you need something
heavier so they have the triathlon gold
so is there anything special you want to
say about this basically last year we
came up with the regular try answer and
this year this one is actually 80 plus
gold also right here they're working on
to make it flat cable like that instead
of this so they've got the the rounded
sleeve cable here and they're working on
releasing one like over here where it's
flat cable not the sleeving but more of
a
rubbery outside on a sleepover but
rubbery outside so they're working on
that getting that over here this is semi
modular so you have the cables that you
need already attached so that's actually
not that bad because you're gonna use
all these anyways you've got eight pin
power and 24-pin power and then the rest
of its modular so you might not use
everything else so they let you choose
what you're gonna use there so basically
the feature of this as we all know MMX
is always at a higher price point and
this one it's got a more aggressive
pricing on these power supplies it's
also very compact as usual any of you
guys that are worried about the low
power states of hassle as well both of
these power supplies correct both of
these power supplies are fully has well
supported so no worries there you've got
all the power you could need there very
clean-cut very nice power supplies
thanks for running us through this we're
gonna jump order over the fan so I'll
see you on the other side if you're into
fanless power supplies make sure you
comment on the video like the video all
that kind of stuff and subscribe to see
all of our context content all right
guys it's possibly the last video from
the animatics booth but we couldn't
leave without checking out their fans
and there's this nice little button here
that I'm gonna have you explain 180
millimeters and this one you also have
the mouthful for 200 millimeter fan so
you know it's either or if you want you
half the mount hole from this clip fit
and also not only it turns on you can
switch on two different modes as you can
see this one or this
so pretty much that's it but this fan I
mean it's like if you get a fan
everything's in it you can have
different you know different molds or no
lights at all and they're also all our
new fans it comes with the technology
called ApS it means adjustable peak
speed right so all these fans are PWM so
the peak speed of them you can change to
twelve hundred nine hundred or six
hundred so if you want like a more
powerful fan right here I think that's
already the top so twelve hundred it's
like oh can you see my hair and then if
you turn it over lower some somebody
likes it to be you know a little quiet
seems like it's a really slow right now
so 600 rpm at peak speed it's a really
quiet thing you know it doesn't really
make any snow also it comes with the 12
112 centimeter 120 as well it comes in
different colors all our NMX mints you
can pop the place out that's what our
patent everybody knows it's interesting
to see very feature full fans a lot of
fans that you buy it's just like okay
you plug it into your system it'll
hopefully work and then that's pretty
much all you do with your fan so it's
interesting to see fans that you
actually do a lot with and personalized
to your system and how fast you want to
go what you want to look like everything
you got one more fan to cover down here
which is a different direction for enter
max so I'll lead you up so this is um
this is a brand new fan that we have
normally you know we always have little
crazy LED lights this one is the 120
millimeter high-pressure air flow fan as
you can see let me stop this real quick
the blades are a little different than
our normal ones it's not more blades as
well if you yeah if you can stop it's
more blades and then you have
you know it creates more air pressure if
you turn it and right here the cut right
here it's also different because you
know it generates more pressure on the
fan and not only that this is really
really quiet normally high pressure fans
are like a little louder but I don't
know if I can hear it it is pretty loud
in here so it's hard to discern audio
but I did put my ear up to it when it
wasn't quite as loud and I couldn't
really hear anything other than the
whirr of air which is usually more of a
calming noise and not annoying the
things are usually listening for his
tics and annoying high-pitched sounds I
didn't hear any of that but like I did
say it is loud in here so I'm not sure
but it's it's an interesting new
direction it's definitely quiet because
I can hear other things I've done other
fans here while we've been here so
that's great new fan style static
pressure fans are great for radiators so
yeah that's awesome thanks for giving
the two of your whole booth that was
great we've had a good time the Animax
booth if you like stuff that you've seen
here like the video comment on the video
what your favorite thing was come what's
in the video if you're gonna buy one of
those white and pink cases because those
are awesome thank you for running us
