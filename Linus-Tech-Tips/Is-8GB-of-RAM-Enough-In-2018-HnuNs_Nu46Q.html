came when Alex craftily turned the
surface laptop he'd just finished
writing the review for into his daily
driver and realized that our model
unfortunately only has 8 gigs of RAM
with no way to upgrade it but does that
matter
well the commonly held wisdom for years
has been that unless you're some kind of
power user 8 gigs ought to be enough for
everyone we'll hold on with Windows 10
and Chrome devouring memory like
Kobayashi at a hot-dog-eating contest
we've been regularly seeing memory usage
over 20 gigs just from web browsing on
our writing workstations so we started
an investigation ek waterblock says MLC
phoenix lineup is designed around quick
disconnect couplings and brings a
modular approach to connecting and
expanding your water cooling loop learn
more at the link below
so our testing rig has a core i7 7700 K
a gtx 1080i and a one terabyte SATA SSD
then we equipped it with 4 8 16 or 32
gigabytes of ram at each stage we
tracked page file usage with performance
monitor then opened up tasks until we
noticed activity once you reach the
threshold where the system starts to
swap data out of bran and onto the boot
drive you might not necessarily see the
system slow to a crawl or anything like
that but you could see a dip in
performance or responsiveness
if a tab or an application that you go
to access has already been paged to your
SSD or your hard drive so first up is
chrome will be looking both at how many
chrome tabs are open when windows starts
using the page file and how many are
open when chrome eventually becomes
unusable bear in mind that not all tabs
behave identically I've seen some use
two gigs of RAM on their own but we
chose a mix of web pages that we feel
should be representative of typical
browsing behavior with four gigs of ram
we actually hit the page file with just
five tabs open and then after 13 chrome
crashed alrighty then with eight gigs we
got to a respectable 25 tabs before any
of them got swapped out and managed 40
before the situation went totally south
with 16 gigs of ram we reached a fairly
unreasonable 80 tabs open before page
filing and then chrome finally crashed
at around a hundred and eighty then with
32 gigs of ram we got all the way to a
hundred and sixty-five tabs before
paging and frankly we didn't feel like
going through the actually kind of
laborious process of opening and loading
350 to 400 web pages in chrome tabs just
to see the program fail I mean if you
want that many tabs you're kind of doing
it wrong and this is coming from me so
let's move then into gaming if all
you're doing is playing a game I think
you might actually be surprised by how
little RAM you actually need
Deus Ex mankind divided for example
which recommends 12 gigs of RAM didn't
suffer too badly even with only a single
four gig stick although with that said
rise of the Tomb Raider had some serious
issues that were only sorted out by
bumping up to eight gigs of RAM after
that though performance didn't change
for either of them when we jumped to 16
or 32 games so ok then 8 gigs for gamers
actually maybe not I mean what if you
don't painstakingly close down all of
your running applications every time you
launch steam for those folks we popped
open our 10 tab test suite and an
instance of discord to see if 8 gigs
could handle it and surprisingly enough
there was no difference at all with the
exception of rise of the Tomb Raider
that game seems to really love its ran
so then depending on the game you
probably won't need 16 gigs of RAM to
play it but it won't give you a ton of
breathing room for the future and you
might need to limit your background
tasks for the best experience so then
what does anyone need more than 8 gigs
of RAM for well I would argue that any
kind of workstation is going to want at
least 16 and you might be surprised to
find out that even more is pretty common
for those kinds of systems Alex actually
has a number of Excel documents from his
engineering days that believe it or not
will not even open on a computer with 8
gigs of RAM and has had some simulations
of fluid flow or suspension movement
that crash out even with 16 gigs of RAM
video editing can also be very demanding
but this is heavily dependent on your
workload if you're cutting together
short to medium length 1080p videos 16
gigs should be plenty but the sky is the
limit here if you use tools like After
Effects you can expect needing 16 to be
an absolute minimum and as the
complexity of your project increases so
does your RAM requirements our latest
season of scrapyard wars for example
because of how darn much footage was in
the timeline immediately crashes we
anything less than 64 gigs of RAM
although for more information about how
much RAM you need through video editing
specifically you can check out our video
here where we tested it with up to 128
now it should be noted that all of what
I'm saying concerns system memory and
not video memory which is used for
loading in 3d objects and textures for
your graphics cards used this is very
important for games and also
professional applications but is
probably a discussion for a different
video when I can almost guarantee we'll
end with well it depends one interesting
side note before we wrap up is that as
we moved up from four gigs of RAM our
system boot times actually got slower it
was only at most a second more but this
is cool if you're aware of a Windows
feature called super fetch it actually
makes sense
super fetch tries to intelligently
preload some programs into RAM so that
they'll launch faster when you need them
so the idea is that if you run out and
buy excess memory it can still be used
for something which doesn't mean though
that we're saying to do that as you
might have noticed Ram prices are out of
control right now so our recommendation
for general users and gamers is eight
gigs if you're looking to scrape by and
be ready to upgrade later and 16 gigs if
you want to be comfortable for a while
as for the workstation users out there
well it depends and you know what else
it depends on yeah it doesn't depend on
that at all forget it course there's new
light Lube fans these things look
freakin incredible they have dual RGB
lighting loops with 16 independent RGB
LEDs in every fan that are split between
two separate loops allowing for nearly
endless customization the included
Corsair lighting node pro enables
dynamic lighting effects with other
coarser links supported devices and
they've got complete PWM control so they
can be controlled anywhere from 600 rpm
all the way up to 1500 rpm depending on
whether you want them to be quieter or
cool
more efficiently so check them out over
at the link in the video description
because come on baby
it's RGB you know you love it so thanks
for watching guys if this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
check out the link to where to buy the
stuff we featured in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
