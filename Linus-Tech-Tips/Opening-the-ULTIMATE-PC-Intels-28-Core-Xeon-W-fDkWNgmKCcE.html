you tell me when you press the button so
when it starts I'm not just standing
here looking like an idiot but clearly
totally unintentional so this is
something that I am actually pretty
excited to open up now here's the funny
thing when Intel launched there I even I
don't even know what exactly they're
calling this platform like because it's
not their workstation platform that's on
lg8 2066 and it's certainly not a server
platform because that is on LGA 3647 but
it uses different chipsets it uses
different chips you can do dual socket
and all that stuff this is the weird in
between when Intel launched what's
inside this box
they actually completely left us out of
the party they were I didn't even know
that they had brought it to market yet
until I saw videos and articles from
other people and I was like hey so you
guys launched the overclockable 28 core
processor huh and they're like yep and I
was like oh well we would have loved to
do a review of that and they were like
oh really it didn't really seem like
your style and I was like what what are
you doing no no actually I kept myself
very calm and collected and you know it
was all very dignified everything anyway
anyway the point is we are writing this
wrong and we have gotten our hands on
the new Xeon w what is it 3175 Anthony
is that 3175
X excuse me I meant I meant 3175 X but
the thing about this product is that
Intel apparently doesn't trust people to
like use it properly so they have gone
as far as to not just send over the CPU
but even send over
a completely built system with the CPU
integrated into it for our use so we are
gonna go ahead and we are gonna open
this up and we are gonna have my first
hands-on experience with the 31 75 X Oh
after I tell you guys about our sponsor
for the day master op master not a drop
not a drop just to fling Wow you would
have thought I staged that but actually
this is here so we can make sure we have
the right motherboard in our system
later excuse me I'm good master Oh
master office featuring the - an H II 4
X X headphones so these are planar
magnetic headphones and - and basically
requires no introduction they have a
fantastic reputation for building high
quality headphones that sound absolutely
fantastic at a fair price they've got
this nice comfortable velour on the
inside of the ear cups here we're not
gonna get a chance to get b-roll David
so do you have that very nice and we've
got nice soft padding on the wide
headband for nice even weight
distribution these are an open-back
headphones so you can expect really nice
spacial awareness in case you know
someone's calling you or whatever else
and beautiful stereo imaging so you guys
can check these out at the link to mass
drop in the video description okay now
let's move on so this is one of those
situations where I kind of wish that we
had prepared for the stream at all
rather than just pulling this off the
pallet and then getting started because
if I'd known that this was like a box
within a box on top of a box situation I
might have removed one of the boxes so
we don't have to wait so long but Intel
clearly wasn't taking any chances
that this would get damaged in shipping
so they have gone ahead and they have
double packed it on top of shipping it
inside a crate rather than via
traditional courier this is a fun one
I'm really not sure what the rationale
was here but even on the inside box okay
make sure you handle that with care okay
I guess yeah is that just a message to
me directly very subtle very subtle you
guys okay so we've got some accessories
here this looks like the cables from an
EVGA power supply including one of those
ever so beefy and again I forget with
c19 I want to say I want to say see 19
connectors can't remember it doesn't
matter
some modular power cables for the inside
of the system
okay I'm included copy of Windows RGB
RGB control for the system they got
their priorities straight
what's that fragile right well the box
the box isn't fragile boxes finding all
the packing materials here we go
this thing is so friggin heavy and the
crazy part is that I don't get this they
shipped an entire duel either 120 or
dual 140 millimeter liquid cooling
system separately so am I expected to
install the cooler myself I mean like
that's fine I'm fully capable of
installing a water cooler I just mean if
you were gonna go to the trouble of pre
building the system for reviewers I
would say that installing like a custom
grade CPU water cooler like this is
probably about as difficult as it gets
so maybe out - there's really dry here
right now okay oh boy I could have read
all the notes that Intel sent over on
this but I figured Anthony's right there
he's read the notes he can tell me if
I'm super important soaring everyone rip
rip all the users of the 84 xx and
really anything else with nice accurate
sound reproduction because that noise
was truly spectacular ly awful all right
so this is actually gonna be my first
look at gigabytes board for Intel's I
guess we would call why don't we call it
what do we want to call it high-end
workstation cuz like the thing is you've
got your you've got your consumer which
is on LGA 1150 whatever we're on now 55
right now can't remember it was 56 then
50 51 50 I don't know it's one of those
so you've got your 11 5x consumer
platform
you've got your xx xx you know a TD T
high-end
platform then you've got entry-level
work stations on LGA 2066 then we've got
ya hues high-end workstation on 3167
so that is probably why where should I
put this tempered glass I don't want
this to break I'm gonna put it inside
this box that seemed safe so this is
probably why Intel included a new cooler
for me do you guys do you guys want me
to install it on streem I mean I guess
if we're like if we're if we're
streaming the experience here we might
as well do it because this is a very
kludged together looking solution right
here
so what makes this platform stand out
from the other ones in Intel's lineup
well there are a couple of things first
and foremost it uses an entirely
different socket so as I alluded to
before this is LGA 3647 so that is like
what 50% more pins than 2066 more than
50% more pins now what are they doing
with all of those pins I'm glad you
asked so a couple of things number one
is they need more power because LGA 3647
at this time goes up to 28 processing
cores as opposed to 18 processing cores
in the high in the low-end workstation
high-end desktop socket LGA 2066
the other thing that these extra pins do
is handle the additional memory channels
that are available to this CPU so when
you have all those course you need a ton
of memory bandwidth in order to keep
them all fed so you can see here we've
got six memory sticks installed but
we've also got an additional six
available ddr4 memory slots so this is a
six channel memory controller not quite
as many as AMD has on epic but you know
hey who's keeping count anyway alright
what else do we have here oh yeah this
is fun so everything about this
motherboard is basically super-sized you
know what I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna
pull this graphics card for now just so
that we can get
a bit of a better look at it so the
socket is actually pretty much the takes
up the entire area under that copper
plate there and I'll talk through this
cooling solution and why it's not really
that great once I've popped it off but
the socket is like I don't know five or
six X the size of a consumer socket the
board itself actually Anthony can I ask
a favor of you
can you stop monitoring the stream for
like 30 seconds and grab me an ATX board
just like just like that blue PCB Intel
one that's in the little like paper
thing full of other boards you know
they're just the slighty thing yeah just
like one of those would be great this is
gonna come out I swear I have undone
this group okay there it goes all right
so the motherboard is super-sized
a standard ATX board would be about from
here to here down to here and then would
contain one two three four five six
seven expansion slots now this one also
has seven two three four five six seven
seven expansion slots except for one
critical difference there's actually a
gap of three expansion slots between
where the i/o would normally end on a
standard motherboard an ATX motherboard
and where the PCI Express expansion
would begin but all that space is
getting taken up because while here
thank you check this out ATX motherboard
for scale this all the way over here
this is still motherboard folks it is
like double the size so here's another
thing that's taking up mondo space on a
standard motherboard this area up here
kind of in between the CPU socket and
the top and then in between the CPU
socket and the i/o of the board is
typically reserved for your vrm so
that's where you take your 12 volt DC
that's coming out of your power supply
and you turn it into nice clean stable
power at the voltage that your
particular CPU requires well that space
wasn't enough and instead this entire
segment of the board all the way along
the top with this gigantic heat pipe
cooler and for cooling fans on it is the
vrm that my friends is exactly how much
power intel expects could be consumed by
this cpu now the thing is that this
socket exists in the server space where
motherboards really do just have about
this much PCB space dedicated for vrm so
what's the deal here it's because of the
overclocking so those boards are
intended to run CPUs that are just
running within spec there's going to be
world-record subzero overclockers
fooling around with these things so they
needed to make sure that they were beefy
enough to handle multiple times over
potentially the power draw of what you'd
get even with a 28 core Xeon running on
a standard server what else is what else
is exceptional about this thing I'm
actually gonna start I'm gonna start
pulling it out so oh man where do we
even where do we even start with this
they've gone and kind of cable managed
everything okay why don't we find out
what else we're dealing with here so
we've got a 1080 T i/o we're gonna need
to replace that we're gonna need
something 20 atti class by the time we
fire this up right Anthony yet probably
but not just yet I've got one in my
office that we can actually borrow from
my bench I was working on the roof 8k
red footage video today you know what I
know why this sorry everyone I know why
this is so heavy I'm gonna go ahead and
pull the tempered glass panel off the
back here so between these two tempered
glass panels this thing just weighs way
too much it's way too much get it way
too much mass you can't fire me you
can't fire me because I already fired me
that joke was terrible
David do you promise not to trip over
this if I put it here okay all right all
right
I'm gonna put it up here then it's
probably fine probably fine okay so
let's go ahead and look at what all they
installed in this thing oh there's some
there's some sorry there's some pretty
fun hardware in there so they threw in
one of the UDOT two versions of their
905 P series octane SSDs so that looks
like it's gonna be our boot drive down
there
we've got EVGA supernova 1600 T - that's
an 80 plus titanium 1600 watt power
supply of course and all the fans and
everything are hooked up so this must be
like one of their demo systems because
even though it's got you know some
pretty nice hardware and decent cable
management and everything like it
doesn't have the i/o shield or anything
like that and so this has got to be like
an early early sample board it's this is
a funny thing to me you've got so many
PCI Express Lanes so these things are
equipped with thighs at 48 Anthony 48 so
48 PCI Express gen3 lanes but there's
almost none of it dedicated to IO here I
remember I remember noticing this about
one of a Seuss's early engineering like
prototype grade boards for this platform
but a lot of time what you'll see on
like repurposed server hardware for
desktop use is you'll see like gaps like
this where stuff that wouldn't make
sense on the desktop like VGA and like a
serial port might just get left off and
then the gaps on the PCB are just left
so that they don't have to redesign that
for what is definitely going to be a
very very low volume part they only have
to redesign the parts of the board that
they actually need to change and then
they'll just reuse other stuff so I
think that's why we ended up with really
bare-bones i/o on this particular board
at least that's one theory
like I don't actually know for sure so
I'm gonna go ahead and start start
popping things off here so note as we go
all the connectors I'm removing so that
is two 6-pin PCI Express connectors
going into the motherboard right there
those are for apparently their OC peg
underscore one now I don't know if those
are for high power draw graphics cards
being in here because you could put up
to four graphics cards in here and
remember even though 4 Way SLI is dead
as of I think two generations ago or
whenever it was overclockers are still
able to enable it for certain benchmarks
so I don't know if these are for that or
if they're extra power for the CPU I
would have to consult the manual to find
that out but I kind of you know I kind
of lean towards probably for graphics
just because there isn't anything else
for that and there are plenty old power
connectors for the CPU as we are about
to see so as we go up this edge I'm
pulling out are you two data cable for
our obtained drive down there we've got
two fan connectors for these beefy boys
that are on this very custom ASA tech
cooler we'll dig into that a little bit
when we remove it this is gonna be a
much longer stream than I expected so
David how's your back you good okay
well get buckled in because this is
gonna be quite a thing I didn't realize
I was going to be installing a water
cooler on top of doing a board swap so
now here we're pulling out another power
connector and note this to 24-pin power
connectors like what apparently this is
optional because it was clearly working
without it but you can plug two power
supplies directly into this motherboard
like what also here we're gonna go ahead
and keep moving across the top here yeah
my friends that is not two but four
eight pin CPU power connectors all the
way up at the top of the board on the
left and on the right here now there's
only two installed right now so I guess
the other two are optional if you're not
doing like sub-zero overclocking or
whatever else but again it gives you
some idea of what they expect might
these poor these poor boards and CPUs
might get put through we're not gonna be
doing anything that nuts though we will
leave the extreme overclocking challenge
between like gamers Nexus and
and J's two cents I think so I have a
slight problem Anthony can you I fix it
kit me at some point here all right yeah
some point in the relatively near future
because I don't have the Torx bit but if
you could get in mind I know for sure my
kit has all the pieces it's in my office
on the left of my bench table thank you
so yeah I need these I need to undo
these Torx screws here I'm pretty sure
the iFixit kid has the right bid for it
and then I also just need to find where
the crap the screws are on this very
strange motherboard form factor because
I won't be able to pull the board out
without undoing them oh I guess this I
can take a moment to talk about the the
cooler so I recognize this this is
clearly a okay it's labeled this is
clearly an ace attack AIO water cooler
but it's unlike any one that I've seen
before something a lot of people don't
know is that while ace attack does
provide coolers for consumer brands that
you've heard of like the Corsair for
example they also do a ton of OEM work
in the server space even going as far as
to provide cooling solutions for large
data centers so it's not surprising
necessarily to me to see a custom
solution from ASA tech it's just that
this one is pretty darn weird so the
first thing I noticed was that this
block so this this core block and pump
design was clearly not designed for such
an immense CPU like it obviously doesn't
cover it so there were going to be cores
of this processor that were basically
not covered by cooling water obviously
that would be a problem so what they've
done here is as like an intermediary
step yeah I think these ones first as
like an intermediary layer they've gone
and they've thrown this
thick copper plate because even though a
CPU does have an IHS an integrated heat
spreader that is designed to spread out
the heat from the die apparently that
was not considered enough and they
needed this nice thick piece of copper
to act as kind of like a heat buffer so
that it could help to absorb and spread
out all the heat that's coming off the
CPU it also clearly didn't work as well
as they were hoping because they went
included that that EK solution in the
box so here we can get a look at a
couple of things so one is the carrier
plate like the carrier I don't know sled
you might call it you gonna you're gonna
come off o the Tim breaker oh cool it's
right here there's a little icon there
yep perfect
you're supposed to pry up on it there
that's neat okay so we get a look at
this carrier thing here can you just
come off please there it is okay
just gonna release that clip and that
one okay so that's designed to hold the
CPU while you install it so you don't
accidentally hung up it's not a bloody
bit pin in this socket well it doesn't
matter cuz I'm gonna be putting that
Asus board in anyway
wow there's more than one got to be
kidding me you can really see it from oh
you can really see it from this angle
down here there's a vent pin there and
there's like four of them here can you
see them at all see the one can you see
those four you can really see it from my
angle if we swap spots yeah you see that
okay you guys we were live-streaming
this I did nothing I swear I did nothing
all right
yeah that's clearly a bad socket anyway
um so a couple other things we can look
at we can see the sheer magnitude of
this copper plate that they're using to
spread that heat out that's pretty
impressive and then we also get a look
at the CPU itself so back when Intel was
demoing this word on the street was that
they were just using kind of tuned Zeon
Zeon
81 76 is or 81 80s which are 28 cores
fit in the socket and they were just
manually changing them to have an
unlocked multiplier well now we get a
specialized chip so I actually don't
remember all of the exact speeds and
feeds off the top of my head so I'm
totally gonna cheat and look at my phone
but basically this is the Xeon wws for
workstation 31 75 X and I'm going to so
let's see it's there 14 nanometer + +
process 28 course 56 threads so it does
have hyper threading text 1 gigahertz
base and it boosts up to 4 point 3
gigahertz 3.0 3.8 actually with all
cores active although that's not with
avx2
workloads it's got a total of 38 and a
half Meg's of level 3 cache 28 Meg's and
level 2 cache ridiculous and the TDP is
255 watts and of course we can expect
that to go much higher with overclocking
so we're gonna go ahead we're gonna put
this aside for now we're definitely not
going to drop it I did send an email
asking nicely for a replacement for my
Xeon 8180 that I dropped and nobody has
replied to me so it looks like there's a
good chance I'm either gonna have to use
engineering samples or pony up and buy
one which sucks because that's even more
expensive than this one
anyway that's CPUs not really gonna
stand out that much to anyone who's been
watching the the saga that has been six
workstations one CPU the thing that's
really special about it is just that
it's overclockable alright go ahead and
pull this board out now that gives us a
really good feel for the scale of this
thing one thing I really will say that I
like about gigabyte solution here is
that they've gone ahead and they've
implemented the full 7 PCI Express slots
instead of just four with double spacing
like a soos is done on their board but
unfortunately like I have no idea if I
were to go and reinstall this CPU if
this thing would even work so if I did
have any projects in mind that required
a bunch of PCI Express slots then I
might not even be able to do them
hmm that's a little frustrating all
right let's go almost said the wrong one
now let's turn our attention to this
cooler I'm gonna go ahead and pull it
out but so the first thing that stood
out was that they had to use this copper
plate to increase the effective size of
it just to be able to cool a cpu of that
that magnitude the second thing was the
fans that they're using on it so these
right here I actually can't tell the
brand but it looks like they're like
pana flows or deltas or something like
that you can tell just from oops you can
tell just from the plastics that they
use that these are designed to be high
rpm fans because something actually
again this is something a lot of people
might not realize something a lot of
people don't know is that the force on a
fan as it's spinning is actually
significant enough that even on a
lightweight desktop fan like one from
Noctua the the blades will actually
spread out and flatten in a significant
way while they are operating and that
can affect the tolerances of it so if
you're trying to let's say for example
like what happens with not to his latest
fan if you're trying to get the blades
really close to the outside of the hub
so you don't have that wasted air gap
there it can be really really difficult
and it also means that if you're
building a high performance high rpm fan
you have to account for that even more
because it's going to be spinning faster
which is going to exacerbate the problem
then the third thing I noticed about it
right so I'm saying these are high
performance fins then the third thing I
noticed about it oh boy
ah deaf Clippers Anthony by any chance
Clippers are an oh I have a knife it's
okay I'll just use my knife where'd my
knife go David do you know where the
knife is are you gesturing to it or are
you just stabilizing yourself are you
just in alright now you know okay well I
will grab another knife yay now there's
a missing knife around here somewhere
that's always that's always good
alright let's just free this
yeah okay the third thing I noticed is
that on top of this being a thicker than
standard radiator typical desktop
cooling solutions are going to be the
slim style radiators what we used to
call them I guess I'm not on top of
being thicker this is an extremely high
thin count radiator so what a higher fin
count does is so you've got your copper
tubes that allow the water to go from
here we go from the inlet all the way
down so half of this is hot water coming
down and the other half is cool water
going up and obviously there's no clear
division between the hot and the cool
water and actually it's all like mostly
the same temperature at the rate that
water moves in a loop like this but
basically it just means that half of
these tubes are carrying this water down
and half of them are carrying them up to
the outlet up here so what the fin count
means is that these usually aluminum
fins but these ones are they copper or
lumen I saw one that was scratched Wow
these are copper fins this is a really
nice radiator this is like ball
inexpensive so you typically have brass
in the tubes and tanks and then aluminum
in the fins but you can see right here
that copper color these are copper fins
anyway so you can either have these
double triangles like they've done here
or you can just have single ones and
when you have the less dense arrangement
of fins it's more optimized for lower
rpm lower static pressure fans so you go
and you put low performance fans on that
it'll actually do better than if you put
those fans on a thick one like this and
similarly if you take a high fin count
one like this one and put it with those
low performance fans it'll it'll
suffocate it won't be able to push the
air through so you need to pair high
density - Count's radiators with high
performance fans and then vice versa in
order to get the best experience either
way so yeah this is a this is a crazy
friggin water cooler and again they
clearly didn't think it was enough all
right
so we've gone as far as tearing this
whole thing down I guess now it's
to build it back up and then maybe like
I don't know fire it up
run some run some Cinebench do like a
blender chest or like whatever it is you
guys want I mean it's it's your live
stream oh I'm so sorry there we go
alright I gotta clear a little bit of
space here the the amount of room that a
build like this takes up is
significantly more than I'm used to
because like the mother the components
the components are also large so this
right here is our ROG Dominus extreme
this has not been tested yet
which is exactly what I think Intel was
probably trying to avoid when they sent
us a completed system rather than having
us build it ourselves but you know
theoretically it should be fine and wow
that's that's fancy it comes with this
nice little like foam you know test
bench station effectively underneath it
so I can go ahead and put that on top of
the box
it's friggin heavy feature-wise it's
very similar to the other one so you got
you to 24 pins you've got is that even
more yeah you've got even more CPU power
connectors to eight pin EPS and then on
each side and then an additional 6 pin
PCI Express although it could be that
again those are for the graphics lot
somehow no I don't think so because
they've got an easy plug down here
they've got an additional 6 pin down
here that I believe is probably gonna be
for these guys yeah your USB 3 yeah you
know what who cares let's go ahead and
get this thing built ah
there's nowhere to put anything it's
fine
accessories wise nothing is labeled
thank you Asus I mean this whole
platform is not really intended for
consumers though so I can kind of
understand why the documentation is a
little bit lacking in fact I don't even
see a manual in here because it's going
to be system integrators that are going
to be the ones who can who even can get
access to this Hardware no this does
appear to be a manual manual ventia
stickers not what I'm looking for what I
really want is the i/o shield but you
know that's okay don't label anything
you guys just have clean black boxes you
know it's fine I got all the time in the
world stuff and live streaming
anything wait why is this not going you
know what it doesn't matter where is my
i/o shield what even are these what is
this wait no what Wow
okay so one of the things that a sous
does on some of their high-end boards is
they've got an extra slot on them I
didn't even notice this they've got an
extra slot that kind of looks like
another memory slot so you got your your
six channels so six slots total on
either side three channels on either
side and then you've got these
additional ones both on the right and
the left called dim dot too so they look
like a memory slot but they're not
they're actually just running standard
PCI Express and then it's just using a
proprietary connector here and you're
supposed to install these puppies so
these are single dim dot two to dual m
dot two adapters and these are fancy
ones now so you guys you can see the
mounting hardware down here that support
still just to 2 m dot two drives but
with like massive heat sinks on them and
I go ahead they may include a couple of
those for you so that's that's a nice
touch thank you you guys oh wow had a
panic moment there I thought for a
second one of them was using a square
ilm and one of them was using a narrow
island but they're both using narrow
aisle m so on on intel server platforms
there's actually two different types of
like cooler mount configurations that
are available
I don't see an IO shield in here is
there no i/o shield
bloody hell yeah it's integrated on the
bright side I swear I saw it I swear I
saw it before you said it please believe
me do you believe me Anthony I don't
think he believes me that's fine I don't
remember what I was talking about
anymore dang it that's fine let's go
ahead and get this thing installed so uh
come on down we can go ahead and remove
our oh right square versus narrow aisle
M so you can either have it square for
boards that have more space or there's a
narrow version like this a rectangular
version if everything's all full of DIMM
slots and dim dot two slots and fan
headers and all the kinds of crazy
nonsense like
so let's go ahead and grab our CPU
carrier let's see if I can remember
which way it goes ah I don't have to
wonderful it's got a label on it I do
love it when things work out but which
way does it go trying to remember huh
yep
hopefully this way seems like this way
yeah sure no that doesn't seem to be
working very well at all does it give me
a sec quite there's a lot of there's a
lot of play there it doesn't go in this
way does it don't can't cuz this has to
go up through the cooler okay
thinking no this is embarrassing I
really wish I'd paid it so I've never
actually used these you don't
technically have to Wow should I just
not I've never used these when I've done
LGA 36:47 installs before because none
of the engineering sample boards that I
got had them included and the CPUs
didn't come with them at least at that
time anyway
so I always just plunked the CPU into
the socket and then installed my cooler
on top and I guess that's going to be
the approach we're taking because I
can't figure out how to put it on right
now so I just chuck it on there after
the fact sure why not
there now it's on heck yeah actual
sure yeah yeah why not
now obviously it's not gonna hold it in
very well like this actually it does
seem to be a link it in oh uh not very
well you know what so we're gonna go
ahead and we're gonna put our CPU cooler
on now so this is one of UK's Fenix kits
which I haven't actually personally
installed before but it couldn't be that
complicated @ck they usually have pretty
good mounting hardware like I said this
is sending up being a much longer screen
than I thought but hopefully you guys
are into it how many people are watching
right now Anthony just okay so
apparently people do care about this
people care that I didn't clean off the
thermal compound so I'm gonna let you
guys in on a little secret for the best
possible results you should definitely
do that but we're talking like a degree
honestly I have actually tested it I
never did a video about it called can
you reuse thermal compound because I
didn't want to deal with all the
complaints about it because even if the
results were what they were people were
still gonna hate it but actually no I do
not intend to bother replacing thermal
compound it will spread out again when I
put this new block on it I'm very very
sorry if it overheats you guys get to
tell me that you told me so okay deal
okay deal so our Hardware here oh boy I
get to assemble my own mounting hardware
for the CPU block that should be fine so
once again we are looking at a very
beefy radiator but this one's a little
bit different so in order to avoid
patent disputes with folks like ASA tech
ek has gone integrated the pump over
here I believe that's the pump either
that or that I don't know
doesn't really matter and then you can
see they've gone with a slightly
different approach to the radiator this
is still copper but it's using still
dents but just these use instead of the
double like kind of triangle
configuration please remove before use
let's do that before we forget a once
once I have done that in my entire
career both just as a PC tech and as a
youtuber never live it down the worst
part was that I had given Alex a really
hard time about it like a couple months
prior and then I went and did it yeah
actually that really doesn't look like
enough thermal compound was left behind
shoot okay I will have to reapply my
thermal compound do we have any paper
towel handy by any chance there's
usually someone said is there not wow
they did a really good job of cleaning
up on Monday do you mind Anthony Anthony
do you mind Anthony grabbing something I
know I've got thermal paste there I'll
just use the included stuff doesn't
really matter all right in the meantime
I can go ahead and I can mount this
radiator so I'm going to need different
screws because you can see they've got
it configured for exhaust out the front
of the case actually that's the same way
the other one was configured but it's
the fans on the case side instead of the
rat on the case side and they use
different types of screws so I'm gonna
go ahead and just kind of pop this in
here and then go look for whatever it is
that they intend for me to use Oh anyone
might want to come around this side
David because this is where most of the
action is gonna be for a little bit here
alright okay uh oh uh Anthony oh you're
back good axle wait nope never mind they
did include some fan screws so this
looks like it's like an intel care
package as opposed to something that
just arrived out of the box from UK
because they've got exactly just the fan
screws that I need and there's no
standard radiator mounting screws as far
as I can tell
thank you sir oh no problem we got this
alright let's go ahead and put those
there I'm not gonna put all 12 in I'm
sorry you guys but I will put in six
that will be our little compromise oh
man these front panel cables are getting
in my way a little bit here hopefully I
can squish them enough I can get this
rad in that is really tight that is a
really tight fit I mean I would expect
that everything about building a system
like this is going to be sort of not for
the average builder like not for the
novice and I do kind of understand the
rationale behind making this pretty much
a system integrators only part with that
said I mean you know it's nice to be
given the choice as a consumer as well
do you want to check Anthony has this
processor showed up on like new area
Gramma's on yet I'm just kind of curious
oh man
so these gaps are a little bit some of
them anyway
the tolerances are not very good on this
case I think either that or it was
stretched before so the gaps on this
side are a little bit wider than these
ones and the heads of these screws are
really small for a fan screw so it's
actually slipping through on the right
hand side there but it's not going to
impede us I don't think new egg for
three grand hey not available okay so
there you go it's anywhere from 1,800 to
three good I sincerely doubt you'll get
it for 1,800 oh the Dominus that the
motherboard the motherboard is two grand
what Wow
well that's a new one I mean even like
the old SR 2 and like skull trail boards
and stuff we're only in the you know
sort of $600 range if I recall correctly
like six seven
eight wow that's a new that's a new hi
mark I think at least that I'm aware of
alright so that's in there well enough
I'm not I'm not concerned about that
coming off oh I am a little concerned
about just sort of like generally
breaking this as I continue to build it
here because I'm trying to go fast to be
respectful of your guys's time and also
trying to do it somewhat properly so you
guys don't yell at me all right we will
clean the thermal compound I have backed
down on that one I always do a dry pass
first you actually can remove a lot more
of it that way and then you're just left
with the remnants
who's asking Riley wants to know how
much longer oh he has to shoot teklynx
doesn't he ha ha Wow how about that
there Riley ah ah okay that's good ah
let's go ahead and install this
motherboard then I guess and hope that
the CPU doesn't fall out of the socket
while we do that
wouldn't that be embarrassing breaking
another until 28 core yeah that's really
not holding that in there at all
hmm well I might have made my life a
little bit more difficult but it
wouldn't be the first time it's
certainly not the last let's go ahead
and just lay the keys down Scott lay the
case down huh what Oh must be Friday I
need to lie down all right oops
so I'm sorry David but you're not gonna
be able to see this very well I guess
unless do you have an angle there
there's an Apple box do you need an
Apple box I will have a box you ready
here we go
all right there's some movie magic for
you guys at home it's not close enough
dang it all right well you got this
thank you sir there was really nothing I
could do to help you okay so I actually
oh wow
this board is a little different we can
clear this clear this space that we need
so instead of being so long like the
other one with that with the ten slot
configuration a soos starts there PCI
Express slots right here it's only a
standard ATX length so what that means
is that these fans are in the way of our
cooler right now oh boy seems like
there's a bunch of room between the
headers here but something is stopping
me no it's this alright maybe it's that
these are pulled out too far right now
cuz yeah it's not the fans
it's these capacitors that are built
into these cables yeah this is not not
amazing what's happening right now this
is what we get this is what we get
I'm sure over I didn't tell they're just
like - this is why we sent you a
completed system this is literally
exactly the reason that we did that you
knew that you knew that we dared to be
different
oh my goodness I just can't even like I
just can't even get it it at all you
know what we're close to just that all
those cables I don't think we can do it
like we can do it I think I have to
liberate the cables first and then I'm
just gonna have to figure out how the
crap to get them over there oh boy um
how that's gonna be interesting thing is
so big it's just I'm wildy
what's under it
okay usb3 come on come on baby just get
in there you got it you could do it oh
okay
now after all that of course they
because the boards are different sizes
not all of the mounting holes line up so
there's no nothing to plug into here or
here yeah it's very funny Anthony very
funny so I have to take it back out all
the things you guys don't normally see
in the video right this is this is the
beauty this is the beauty of doing it
live beauty all right so let's have a
look-see shall we we've got one two
three four across the top you know what
two is enough we've got two more right
here and here
those ones do appear to line up but that
right there that was going to be a big
old problem for us so we had an extra
that was probably actually scratching on
the back of this back plate here that
was gonna be a real big problem we could
have well I mean it's got a back plate
so maybe not as big of a problem so it
would have flexed the board a little bit
but it probably would have been okay but
if you don't have a back plate on the
back of your motherboard then what you
can do in a situation like that is you
can end up actually scratching the back
of your board breaking traces and
effectively
well destroying it so we don't want any
of that going on guys don't let me
forget that I put this bit here I will
need that let's go ahead and pull that
standoff out first though okay so we've
got this guy and then this guy and then
this guy yep that should line up just
nicely then we've got this guy
which does look like it is lined up
perfectly fine we've got this grommet to
fix okay that's just my OCD getting the
better of me this doesn't actually
matter we don't actually have to do this
oh now I can't stop okay I have to do
this oh wow it's worse than before just
please go oh please just go in entering
panic mode in five four three two one
panic mode averted okay okay then we
also need this one so we can go ahead
and pop one in there that's the one we
took out and then this guy is not doing
anything so might as well move it up
sorry you guys can't really see what I'm
doing right now this one it's over here
oh it's a really awkward angle to work
at but feel don't feel bad for me feel
bad for David he's working harder than I
am right now by a long shot all right
here we go for those of you don't know
David is the camera guy who's shooting
right now anthony is working the least
hard out of all of us he just asked us
like fetch stuff occasionally and drink
Pepsi Diet Pepsi I'm sure see I know his
drink preferences he's very particular
okay so the board's in and everything
that I was expecting to have a standoff
in it does so we're gonna call that good
enough and we're gonna go ahead and
screw it in let's try not to drop any of
these screws oh I've already got one
loaded up here oh wow this board
supports everything it's even got a oh
wait I thought that said Thunderbolt
header does it have a Thunderbolt header
I'd be pretty impressed if it did yeah
it does God support for Thunderbolt got
all
all the things to you dot twos on this
puppy you got eight say two slots you
got those ridiculous for m dot tubes
what's interesting though is that even
with the size of this thing
it doesn't have a single m dot to in
like a standard configuration just lying
flat on the board so you have to use
those dim dot two cards interesting now
what's also interesting is that I appear
to be short one screw hmm I find that to
be a little bit concerning so I can
actually check why I'm sure to screw
fairly easily so two across the top to
down the middle one more here and four
across the bottom so that should be nine
and I'm just going to check from the
back one two three are you okay
three four yeah five six seven
this one eight nine yeah okay that's
right why do I have an extra screw oh ha
ha ha ah the screws for the graphics
card okay let's just carry on then shall
we
what's the chat figure it out Anthony
when I'm cringing when I picked up the
case oh right the CPUs not in yet
okay well you coulda told me that thanks
Anthony
I know you've always got my back well
you're stabbing me in the face Oh the
CPU wasn't what sorry
oh yeah no he just told me I forgot okay
this is the worst peel of all time came
off in three pieces
terrible terrible no one by this board
eighteen hundred dollars worst peel ever
just kidding that's not that's not why
anyone cares about this board okay so
now we've got new problems I have
basically no way to access the 8 pin
connectors over there but first we're
gonna we're gonna deal with this once
and for all we've got to assemble the
mounting for the block I'm just gonna
have to figure out exactly how to do
that bunch of like wow you know when
your cooler comes with not one not two
not three but four allen wrenches you're
in for a super duper good time
I think someone's at the door oh boy
you've got Stoppers you've got what even
the crap are we looking at here okay ow
instructions are there instructions I
really
alright well you saw it folks this was
it this was the point where this stream
went completely off the rails okay
hopefully we have all those thumb screws
and hopefully these are the instruct
note these are the instructions for the
ASA tech cooler come back I really
really really need that I need that to
not be gone does this not have nope okay
well it's not clear exactly how this
goes together but I like to think of
myself as a reasonably clever so I'm
sure I will figure it out basically
we've got four basically we've got four
of these and they need to go through
these holes and hold this to that sure
I'd love to know where the instructions
are stuck inside the packing of the box
I don't see them I don't think that are
they referring to this that's just a
protector for the oh thank you chat
beautiful okay how are we doing here oh
boy
these might just be the standard
instructions for the standard kit that
doesn't go on LGA 3647 yeah I think this
is just like how to fill your loop holy
crap this isn't filled of course not
oh boy oh boy and no there are no
instructions for LGA 36:47 stop stop
just go there alright so there are a few
things I know one that the threading is
slightly different between the corner
screw standoffs and the ones down the
sides so I just need to figure out which
one's of these are which and then I
can't go wrong are they different
they're not different
you know what we're gonna Yolo it we're
gonna put with thermal compound here we
go oh wow there's nothing on the side HS
at all not even Intel confidential
that's really unusual okay hopefully
this is enough goop these are really big
CPUs and require a lot of goop so we're
just gonna put that on there a little
like that and we are just going to screw
these on because
that's all we really have to go on at
this point so here's an allen key
actually I'm doing this out of order it
should be this one first I do have the
prompter remote you can you'll have to
give me one second here though okay you
know normally I scream because it's fun
but this is just stressful this must be
just as stressful for you guys to watch
as it is for me to do to so I don't know
if anyone's having a good time right now
ah here you go
17,000 people at 17,000 people can be
wrong I've actually seen much larger
numbers of people be wrong in the past
talk quieter are you guys shooting on
the tech link set oh okay
so we're just gonna be shooting two
things simultaneously see when you said
you'd figure it out I just I kind of
assumed you'd figure out something
different like shooting over in the
lounge or something but that's okay
we're just we're doing tech linked right
over there on the other side of that
wall and we're doing this live stream
right here on this side of this wall
yeah so that'll be tonight's episode
okay so I've put in the two screws on
the corners and now I'm putting in the
ones on the sides so the first two are
just to keep the block kind of on the
socket and these two actually wrench the
CPU down into the the pins into the LGA
actually is technically the LGA the
thing on the bottom of the CPU or on the
motherboard I think it's the motherboard
so I think we're going into the LGA land
grid array I'm sorry David this ended up
being a much much bigger project than I
anticipated that's on me
that's on me not on you
the good news is that as far as I can
tell this is working it's working and
it's what we expected oh right what we
don't know is if this is actually full
of water or not oh boy
so do they ship this empty or filled oh
man now I kind of wish I'd used the ASA
Tech one again instead of switching to
this I mean we're not gonna be
overclocking it right now anyway why did
I care why did I build it overkill like
a question I've asked myself many times
I don't know oh man
okay do you happen to know if the
Phoenix comes prefilled and if you like
drain it then expand it Anthony let's
find out I doubt it I really doubt it
okay here we go
all in one expendable blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah okay blah blah
oh right so I think it is supposed to
come prefilled but it's also supposed to
come with quick disconnects this is just
a completely different product manual so
removing the expansion balloon yeah ours
doesn't have an expansion balloon I have
no idea if it's full yeah sort of I mean
it's the Phoenix in the sense that it's
got the same radiator and pump combo as
the Phoenix but it's a different block
it doesn't come with the GPU expansion
module like it's only sorta a Phoenix I
mean it doesn't really okay so why do
they include these if not to fill it or
something
and see they've got these extra Stoppers
- what are they for I don't know
yeah okay you're right worst-case
scenario we start pumping air and we
destroy the pump okay that is a
worst-case scenario and then we have to
install the ASA tech cooler back on but
that's okay I think these people are
enjoying the process hopefully okay okay
so let's go ahead and plug our 24-pin
power in that we can access whoo this is
the primary boom then we can loosen up
our what is this that's you sp3 okay so
actually that we can do as well we're
getting all the easy stuff out of the
way right now that goes right about come
on baby just oh just go in easily please
thank you that goes right about there
thank you then we can loosen our UDOT to
a little bit here see if we can liberate
that a bit no we cannot that's fine now
I can tip it up right cool
yes we can liberate this a bit but we
will need to cut some zip ties I found
my other knife hey this is looking up a
little ah I could really use clippers
right now that would be a lot better
there we go no I'm good huh no not yet
remember do as I say not as I do
and I'm saying don't do that all right
down it goes go ahead and plug in our
UDOT - boom we are making real progress
now here's our front panel audio
no that's USB and that doesn't happen to
line up with any USB header on this
board but that's fine we don't really
need USB anyway um no I just need I just
need the power switch so they use a
different pen out so I'm just gonna take
this tape that was so helpfully applied
to this to make it easy to install I'm
gonna remove it and we're gonna go ahead
and plug our power switch in right about
you know gorgeous front oh you know what
what the heck let's do it
the only live one time all right now we
need to solve a real problem here at the
back are my two 8-pin connectors
obviously there is no way whatsoever to
get those through the back of this it is
completely closed up with this board
they're also cable managing yes Anthony
I take it back I would like Clippers I
can't keep I can't keep doing that
I will cut myself eventually uh yeah
yeah for the views no no no I would
rather not cut myself today
ah okay you know what we also need some
eight pin extensions yes that's our
solution cable mod to the rescue so
David how much can you follow me
this is your this is your umbilical cord
isn't it that's it that's it that's all
okay well maybe we can put yourself over
here and then I'll wave to you from over
where the cable stuff is I think you can
take the power with you actually you
know what you stay there you stir nope
okay okay so I'm going over there I'm
going over the cable and cable and can
you see me I'm going to cable and I need
some eight pin extensions uh-oh I could
have sent Anthony actually that might
have been smart well you know what I'm
gonna grab the box that I think contains
eight pin extensions and then if it
doesn't then you can bail us out Anthony
no this is so ridiculous
can you get through here David oh yeah
like a boss do you need help can I give
you a hand getting up okay the good news
is this is exactly what we needed
wait no this is not exactly what we
needed these are just modular cables I
thought these had female ends ah okay
you know what I'm just I'm taking this
project to the floor there's not enough
space up there anymore okay Anthony my
hopes are my hopes are fading
oh there's one wait no is this
pci-express plenty hell I think this is
PCI Express Anthony you might need to
look for a pin extensions you could try
one of the other bins of cable Maude
stuff or you could try I don't have time
to wait for an order oh you could
you could try the specialty PC power bin
as well yeah that's what led me to
believe there might be some tensions in
here everything here come on
oh there's one yes yes wait I have to
Anthony yes victory is mine
I think see the thing that I don't know
is whether this Asus board also allows
me to just plug in to eight pin
connectors like the gigabyte one and
what I also don't know is where they
would go so we are going to have to
either consult the manual or trial and
error this this this sucker first though
we need to remove these because we are
clearly not cable managing them up the
back anymore there we go then we are
just gonna run them in the messiest way
possible right up over top of the CPU
wait you know what no we can do a little
better than that we're gonna go up right
here do you see it can you see me can
you see yeah okay see the cable heck
yeah
alright so it's coming out right up here
Oh ow
okay wonderful I don't know whether to
laugh or cry this was not what I
intended to do all of this I just
thought you know what simple motherboard
swap they'll be the same size and shape
that's why we have standards standards
yeah I'm sure a soos anyone anyone who's
been sort of following this platform a
little more carefully than me it's
probably just like laughing at me this
whole time and I don't know if Intel's
laughing I think Intel's crying okay I
just need I just need this to go in
there
wait is this one piece of bloody hell
this one's PCI Express Anthony you might
need to know
wait how the heck am I even gonna plug
these in anyway
I forgot about the real challenge the
real challenge is that these fans are in
the way I can't even access that the
sockets anyway ok so this one is gonna
go over there somehow we hope oh could I
do it which one I think I can I think I
can plug it in motherboard box
motherboard box where'd it go here
wait did it come with a manual yes it
did it did okay note the weight of the
board in there doesn't uh doesn't fall
open anymore
okay the manual was in here home stretch
now home stretch baby we've got this I
can plug this thing in I will be so
happy
sorry about that all right bla bla bla
bla bla bla bla bla bla installation
tools and components yeah like your case
is gonna look like that say the optical
disc drive optional you bet it is
alright here are the labels so ATX power
connectors for 8 pin a1 2 b1 2 a 3 B 3
what the crap is this labeling ok please
tell me which ones are optional
please just have it laid out this is the
one you need this is the one you don't
need come on hit me with that useful
information here we go ok so there's a 1
there's a 1 2 a 3 that appear to go from
left to right out that way and then
there's B 1 2 B 3 which go right to left
out that way so for our fully configured
system do not forget to connect the 8
pin power plugs otherwise the system
will not boot it doesn't say which this
motherboard supports up to 2 power
supplies so great with the proper and
push down firmly until the nope it
doesn't say so here's what we're gonna
try we're gonna try a 1 and B 1 and see
if that's enough
so I think I can put this in without
taking out that pan
there's a little thing in my way they'll
get out little thing oh it's a fan
connector I need a spudger oops I
already took this bed earlier and I
didn't put it back so this is my second
spider
I'm sorry Riley okay yeah then okay so
one VIN and this one might just be long
enough to make it without an extension
now the problem is that these don't lock
together on this particular power supply
which is a real hassle for me because it
means I have to both hold them together
and plug them in at the same time all in
a gap that I can't really reach you know
what forget it oh hey Riley are you done
did you just ASMR the whole episode nice
these are this grill is too wide to put
a fan on top of it okay all right with
this fan out of the way I'll be able to
plug in a second eight pin power
connector here oh Anthony did you ever
go get a 20 atti oh it's fine to turn
that off I'm done with that bench yeah
if you don't mind we're we're pretty
close to graphics card install now oh I
can I can smell it I can smell it we're
close just burned past Oh
to taste thanks Dave I'm sorry David
is it good cuz I can't stop and think
about whether it's interesting or not
I'm just trying to build the computer
the computer I should have never taken
apart you know what's hilarious is I'm
planning another livestream where I put
another thing that I should never have
taken apart back together I'm gonna put
that red camera back together and I'm
gonna do it live that's the plan I'm
gonna try anyway I mean I think people
kind of get a kick out of watching me
struggle anyway so if nothing else the
people will be entertained are you not
entertained
I just like I can't get in there can you
see how tight this is too tight to fit a
camera in to see what I'm doing that's
for sure just go okay let's try one at a
time because I can't get my fingers in
there so I just have to maneuver it
using the cable got one halfway in so if
anyone from EVGA is watching that is why
you need the two halves of your a pin if
you're gonna have a four plus four
that's why you need them to lock
together because sometimes you're
building under sub optimal circumstances
and this is nothing if not suboptimal
everything that's going on right now oh
oh thank you sir that's beautiful
Oh still warm all right ah let's just
throw that back on there I guess we're
making real progress now my friends I
really I really you know what I don't
want it I don't want to ruin this pump
Anthony can you check Intel's email and
see if they said if that thing is
prefilled or not thank you it would be
tremendous to know before I turn it on
because we're actually getting
dangerously close to that pardon the
expression all right
ah screwdriver let's go ahead and
install our graphics card in the top
slot here so that's interesting we also
ended up with somehow we're one screw
short instead of ones through extra now
so I only have one screw to put in the
graphics card when I had to when I took
this thing apart I don't know what's a
bigger concern the screws left over or
not enough let me know let me know in
the chat what's worse all right
the peel tab fell off okay hey soos you
guys got to step up your peel game here
this is the worst worst motherboard
peeling experience I've had in quite
some time
all right so that's in it's like barely
supported by this thing go ahead and
screw it in also I think we're gonna oh
yeah we're gonna need the PCI Express
power connectors that used to be plugged
into that gigabyte board just for this
graphics card it needs to eight pins and
a single six pin and they're gorgeous
folks it's beautiful okay what was I
thinking
I don't know sometimes okay Ram let's
just walk this over here now this is yet
another thing that can go wrong today
because this Ram is validated for the
CPU clearly and that is a big factor
these days because the integrated memory
controller is well it's integrated it's
built right into the CPU but you can
still get weird compatibility issues
from board to board let's find out what
we're dealing with here so this is
samsung eight gig 2666 so eight gigs
times six would be what 48 gigs
alright let's go ahead and pop these
tabs ooh that graphics card is still
very toasty so it was running 8k video
playback acceleration like GPU
acceleration and stuff upstairs that's
gonna be a video coming pretty soon
well actually it's funny that it might
not be that soon so that'll give you
guys some idea what our video cue looks
like cuz I shot that like two hours ago
here we go
they say nothing it's optional for
people who want to overclock
well I'm certainly glad I put it in then
because I'll definitely be overclocking
on this stream just kidding I will not
be I'm gonna be happy enough if this
whole thing boots at all and if it
doesn't post I really don't think I can
stick around long enough to troubleshoot
the whole thing because I have to catch
a plane later today I am going to a
wedding so good luck everybody
here we go that's it it's done I will I
will try a couple things so I will at
least try more 8 pin connectors to see
if that's the problem oh I need a power
cable yes here it is and that is one oh
you can like hear it sounds like
knuckles cracking I will need a power
cable here it is that's fine
I will need a portable nuclear generator
no just kidding the outlets should be
fine we're only running at stock speed
with a single graphics card but this
thing could be loaded up to draw more
power than you could provide with a
single outlet I am pretty sure I need
power for my monitor and then I will
also need some time to display cable ah
here we go there's one plugged in to the
monitor already oh man I am pretty
nervous you guys let's see if we get
lights do we have any any indicator
lights whatsoever on the board we do and
their RGB all right moment of truth yeah
there's like a display on here full
color displays things ridiculous okay
wait wait a minute
stop
ah actually let's find out if it posts
first but this thing's gonna overheat
really quickly because there's no power
plugged into the pump
I need this we can still find out if it
posts usually you have enough time oh
that actually might not be a terrible
sign it turned off yep
CPU blah blah blah blah okay
it stuck it BD for a while here remember
back to CPU okay that might not be a
great sign come on baby
code 79 VGA come on hey there it is okay
post let's turn it off quick okay
now we need to figure out where this
goes so I don't know
what the hell excuse me pardon my my
foul language because I didn't see
anything on the top of the radiator unit
that looked like a plug I mean the good
news is hey I only put in six of the
screws that's what I call planning ahead
it's not about truth it's about branding
you know planning ahead oh can I just
rip this off because they go through no
these two are stuck pretty good so show
me the power cords so one of these looks
like an RPM sense and one of them looks
like power but where do they go my plug
oh ha I don't even notice this tripod Oh
neat
so there's power and then here's
tachometer cool so all the fans are
actually powered off this single thing -
that's actually that's pretty elegant
good job UK that's smart use of the
space that otherwise just would have
been pointless and tank space actually I
guess we can just leave this like this
because you only do live once and also
because that way if we have to fill this
loop we will already have access to it
oh yeah I could also just check if it's
filled
good thinking Anthony yeah we can just
check if it's filled fix it to the
rescue actually I'm not going to use my
fix-it kit for that
okay we're almost there David
almost excellent you know what screw it
haha sweet sound of pumping and my weak
justification for this fan hanging here
is that we need some cooling for the
memory yeah hell there was an old
product called the Anne techspot cool
that was basically this it screwed into
like a motherboard standoff and then it
just had this like like our kind of
articulating arm thing that you could
use to just kind of position it wherever
now hold on just a minute here 49 gigs
of ram that doesn't seem right wait yes
it does 48 okay yeah okay cool detect
the devices you two until 480 gig
obtained by blah blah blah CPU fan speed
error that's fine we weren't oh can I
get a keyboard and mouse by any chance
no no I said can I get one
still no no okay
please Thank You Anthony
so this is fantastic everything actually
somehow miraculously appears to be
working and this is why I never learned
okay
neat
so all we need is a keyboard and mouse
oh I can plug in networking now as well
I wonder if this thing has ten gig
networking because you never know when
you get into high-end products either
they include everything you could ever
want or need or they include nothing
because they assume you have enough
money to buy whatever else it is you
could possibly want to need go either
way
oh I guess I could look at the box while
Anthony's over there that would answer
my question well that stuff's gonna fall
out so I'll do it like this LAN a Kwanza
10 gig LAN yep regular Intel LAN so you
have something that works before you
install drivers you got your Wi-Fi 2x2
AC bluetooth b5 interesting so this is
an EE be born Wow
so a soos managed to make their board a
standard size Oh
Thank You Anthony I actually didn't look
back closely at it as I was going but
this is a standard sized board it's SSI
EB I mean it doesn't fit in a lot of
things but that's better than
proprietary like oh yeah I guess he'll
be needing to get a new case cool f1 to
run setup in that beautiful so let's
find out how they had it set so
multi-core enhancement was set to auto
so I guess that might be on would be my
guess oh wait no wait right Intel didn't
set this up this is a new board ok
ah so this doesn't really tell us
anything this just tell us say Seuss's
defaults well screw it let's just do it
then boom please
now usually it's not a problem to swap
from one board with the same chipset to
another board with the same chipset now
your Windows license might freak out a
little bit but where you're really run
into trouble is swapping between
dissimilar architectures so if you have
ok that's potentially not good oh you
know what's really funny is that's the
same error we got earlier so three more
cycles of this and it might work David
yeah it's the bug code and D is driver
so where you really run into trouble is
switching between dissimilar
architectures like trying to go from
this down to you know an Intel Sandy
Bridge or something or going from AMD to
Intel or vice versa that sort of thing
you can't even run into trouble to
though just like swapping out sort of
too many things at once like your
graphics card and your network card and
something else but I don't know I have I
actually have a fair bit of faith that
this is going to work out cut myself
that's how you can tell it's a good
build a little bit of sweat blood and
tears you can't get there without the
blood oh I think I'm supposed to file a
safety report for that what's it called
again incident yeah I don't remember if
you get cut it I'd yeah I did a little
bit although I think might not have been
cutting myself so much it's just my
hands are really dry cuz the air so dry
and it kind of split so hard to say what
I do know is that I am staring at a
Windows desktop how's the screen
brightness for you David I can go a
little brighter I can go a lot brighter
how's that it's not bright more you want
more I got more for you give us more is
that good cool so why don't we start
with a good old-fashioned Cinebench run
Wow
that's pretty fast kind of clock speed
are we running out here so all core
clock yeah it finished too fast and I
didn't get a chance one moment please
let's try that again I love how
tell tuned some little funny things
about this install like how big task
manager is out of the box so you can see
all the threads and like see how they're
correctly aligned here so we're at 2.8
gigahertz all cores there but it was
kind of jumping around a little bit
let's try that one more time 4,000
Cinebench score love it is it supposed
to be 3.3 is it 2.8 oh no I think 3.8 is
max boost and I'm not sure that oh this
is Navy export load okay so we do
already know that
AVX workloads are going to result in
lower clock speeds because they are a
bit more punishing so hey where do you
keep all the blender benchmark stuff
okay oh crap oh shoot are we not oh
that's okay the quanta no the ik want
chair drivers aren't pre-loaded because
this is a different board I just need to
switch Nick ports fine Oh what it what
is what is our easiest contact have to
say oh yeah tell him it's good I got it
oh well I don't know unless I plug them
into the wrong ones in which case he can
feel free to correct me input 1 ah ok
well that's not how he did it but it's
working so I'm sticking with it okay so
so what I actually haven't set up the
blender benchmark you need to install
the full blender right oh really oh I
did not know that
sweet cool let's grab it dang it where's
just the download link you guys please
this is what is going on it keeps
scrolling down instead of up that's
really weird yeah here we go oh I don't
know if I want a daily build Oh fine
okay I guess so
save sure why not no floatplane chats
mad they want emotes oh uh what else do
we want to do on this thing now that
we've got it up and running I mean we
could check temps right whoo yes we
could cool yes let's do that whole let
me just grab hardware monitor real quick
here are you coming down ah edge man to
be not install Chrome for me
they didn't it's like the first thing I
install just don't have to deal with it
Cinebench extreme right here it is this
is so this is four times the workload of
the regular Cinebench and is basically a
new benchmark that was this is like a
community thing right I think so so it's
a modified version so that instead of
seeing these really high core count
processors like the 32 core thread
Ripper or the 2990 like this one instead
of just seeing them just like rip
through it and then not really giving
them a chance to either sometimes get up
to full speed or like settle into their
their their sustained like power limit
this one is designed to take four times
longer so that it'll really separate the
the truly awesome from the just like
very super awesome
let's find out where that download went
all right that's a zip we can go ahead
and extract that so you can tell
everything we're doing today is very
fresh extract yeah / blender yep go for
it uh I sincerely doubt these are XMP
sticks yeah they're like ah guys that
Gary oh okay sure thing okay apparently
this board will do up to 4,000 megahertz
I really don't think this Ram is gonna
do that it's just some pretty bare-bones
RAM actually didn't check the ICS like
they might be really good ones or
something and very overclockable but I'm
not counting on anything right now why
are these taking so long to extract this
like a network bottleneck or something
cuz the CPU is barely being touched four
percent yeah yeah it's a ton of small
files so there you go oh yeah wow so
this one's only 80 Meg's but it's 2,300
files Wow
yep there's your problem got him
did they preload anything else on this
ooh candy crush well we can play candy
crush in the meantime it's time for a
let's play
did you know wrapped candy something
something oh man if I accept these terms
of service am I gonna regret it
oh I regret it walk into Facebook no I
just let's just let's just play yeah no
no I get how it works
wait is this still a tutorial is it just
telling me the answers this isn't real
gaming
yep I'm done okay why don't we try let's
do Cinebench extreme first alright you
can't have both of them open at the same
time I know I don't want to save my
score okay so here's the new one extreme
unofficial nod so this will take a
little longer I mean it's still chewing
through it pretty quick here let's
double-check those clock speeds so yeah
that's 2.8 gigahertz so this is most
assuredly an AV X maybe X 2 workload
neat oh right I downloaded hardware
monitor thank you worthless windows
search I guess I'll just go get it
myself then wait what the crap where did
it go
thank you edge I have no idea where my
download when it never started oh did I
have to click again all right all right
all right nope edges not to blame for
this Oh what just happened wow I'm not a
huge fan of this Mouse it's like the
clicks or hair triggers yeah for gamers
okay
next 32 X 64 here we go alright so I
want to see what kind of temps were
getting just at just at stock speed even
we're not even making it suffer too much
yet that's great that's great
there's so many there's so many here you
can barely like keep them all on the
stupid page okay so we're 20 26 to 28
degrees at idle sorry I can put that on
your side David there you go
and then no no no I got you I got you
fan okay now we're gonna run this again
we've got 1152 the first time around and
now let's fire up task manager okay go
ahead and pop that down there and so you
can see here everything is actually
perfectly under control in the low 40s
so yeah you like a Z on it doesn't draw
crazy amount of power or output a crazy
amount of heat when you're just running
it at stock speeds where you're gonna
get into trouble is when you overclock
it because it's not like you double the
voltage and you double the heat output
like it's an exponential curve so and
then you know Intel and AMD Mel Nvidia
all the chip guys they're always tuning
for that that that sweet spot of as much
performance as they can squeeze without
letting thermals on the power run away
with them well this chip the sort of
rumor is was never designed to be used
like this on an overclockable platform
so it's probably taken some work to even
get it this far
so we're at 11:58 in Cinebench extreme
and we can go ahead and fire up blender
now so here's 2.8 so what's the what's
the dealio with 2.8 you just fire it up
from the folder do you do you have to
run as administrator' or no more info
run anyway we're good ok so this will be
our this will be our last test here so
which one do you guys want to see
actually Anthony which one do you want
yeah I gooseberry how long would we
expect gooseberry to take on this puppy
that's weird it's complaining about my
graphics driver with at least OpenGL 3.3
support well I should have a driver oh
you know what it I might just need a
reboot because the oh wow no yeah the
whatever 1080 TI drivers are on here
apparently are old enough that they
didn't come with 2000 series drivers in
the package would be my guess cuz
normally you can just swap them around
and it'll just grab it okay so we're
gonna need to grab new and video drivers
I'm sorry guys I'm especially sorry to
David who has been holding the camera
like a champion for like an hour and a
half
how long have you been streaming okay an
hour 45 David you rock you can tell even
his big fist pound was exhausted I'm
sorry man you know we have to do it
though we have to see blender we have to
see it through I am amazed this worked
like I could not be yeah you've spent
enough time goofing around with weird
tech with me that's yeah you know that
this is like this is pretty good this is
pretty good for me oh man that's
fantastic uh I mean I don't know what
else can we throw on this thing in the
meantime you can throw I'll throw steam
on here although this really is not
designed for for gaming gaming use not
even with a twenty atti I mean it'll
it'll run games in the same sense that
you can run games on like a six thousand
dollar Quadro and a ten thousand dollars
Eon of course it'll run capes it's just
not a great value and so this is what we
figured about five grand all-in for the
CPU and motherboard
yep so in that neighborhood and then you
know Plus no one puts one graphics card
in the system like that so you're gonna
need a couple 2080 TI's that gets you
for another 2,500 bucks now you're at
$7,500
you're gonna need six channel memory so
you know yet does it Rick
we're good we're back cool
perfect okay so I'm just doing a clean
install right now so we're removing the
previous version of the drivers just so
we don't run into any weird issues and
then it's theoretically this means you
don't need to d2 you in practice its I
don't think quite perfect but it should
be okay
ddu is mostly for switching between
graphics hardware providers so Intel AMD
or Nvidia so weird that soon like very
soon Intel's gonna be a legitimate
gaming graphics hardware provider as
opposed to just onboard oh I
accidentally clicked the ad whoops I
still remember how outraged people were
when they first started integrating ads
in the driver installation process -
like why does my driver installer need
internet access now that's like the
least offensive thing like the least
intrusive part of PC gaming oh man all
right well I guess I might as well like
you know start cleaning up then okay I
guess
can't really go anywhere I needed a bit
for my screwdriver at some point oh yeah
I moved it way over here I don't
remember what I was planning to do with
it oh oh that's interesting right I
didn't even realize careful I didn't
even realize as I was putting it
together but no eks block here does not
use a Torx bit it actually ended up
using a hex bit so I did not need it
wait no it is Torx how did I put those
in how on earth did I put those in oh no
I did use a hex trip no their hex sorry
their hex okay in fairness to me they
both have six something's so all right
let's give it the know there's a Windows
Update No okay let's just see if we
don't need to reboot it's not funny
Anthony
see if we can get away with it
I think we got away with one here all
right all right all right cool blah blah
blah no whoops
no I don't put the donate button right
where the next button is very clever all
right I guess I can just can I just grab
it from the folder on the NASS Oh which
one is that though okay oh here it is
sample blender files okay which one do
you want to do
how long does gooseberry take though
yeah 15 minutes I don't know if we have
15 minutes what's the second most
demanding classroom couple minutes okay
let's do it
wait how do you want to open it bloody
hell
blender how do you think I want to open
a blender file oh I see yeah will that
work
hey did ha nice okay okay I can never
remember how to start it Anthony
sorry f12 is a shortcut dude dang it
go alright so here we go so this
evidently is whoa ouch so we only
managed to hit 2.4 gigahertz on this
particular load what our attempts like
still in the neighborhood of about 40
degrees what's interesting too is we're
not actually maxing out our CPU usage
here which I'm not sure if you guys can
see very well but we're only at about 76
77 % it's been kind of bouncing around a
little bit there so that is going to be
the I mean honestly at a big part of the
reason that we haven't seen desktop
processors and I've used the term
desktop a little bit loosely I mean
there's a desk and they're like chopped
you know obviously as a workstation
processor but we haven't seen desktop
processors with these kinds of core
counts ever before so there's been
technological limitations but I mean AMD
or Intel could have easily done a dual
socket solution or something like that
but even among the high end applications
that are used by creative professionals
or other professionals there are still
going to be limitations to how many
cores can be effectively utilized now I
don't know if this is just something
that requires some tuning on our part to
sort of figure out Anthony took over the
CPU reviews before we ever started using
blender regularly so I had like
literally haven't touched it in a couple
of years as a benchmark but stay tuned
because this is not the last you're
gonna see this this is just us having
some fun taking it out of the box but
Anthony's gonna be working on a full
review of this thing kind of trying to
figure out what is it what is its place
in the market should anybody actually
buy this thing and
he's gonna have a really interesting
point of comparison so our buddies over
at Puget Puget systems actually sent us
over what is it the ninety nine nine DXE
yeah so that's a really unique CPU that
you can only get through what's called
like an auction process so there's no
such thing as just calling up your rap
that tech data or cynics ring or micro
or whatever and just being like yeah
I'll have a ninety nine eight Exe until
only sells them sporadically they'll
just have like X number of them
available and then you bid on them and
so it's entirely a system integrator
only SKU but it's really interesting
because it's 14 cores unlike the 99 80
XE which has 18 course but they they are
clocked - hi Helen back like this thing
turbos - 5 gigahertz just like the 8
core processors on the consumer platform
they like the 6 &amp;amp; 8 course 14 course
very interesting I don't know what they
would you know what the all core turbo
is on that thing by any chance I don't
remember either but it was like
mind-bendingly hi
so we'll compare it against that as well
mostly just out of curiosity since
neither of these are something that are
going to be attainable to normal people
whether it's because they don't have
access to an Intel action or if it's
because they don't have 5 grand for a
CPU and motherboard combo I can give you
guys sort of a preview of the conclusion
mm-hmm actually this is funny I'm you
know what I'm gonna try my best to get
the conclusion exactly right it's an
utterly unique product for those who
need the absolute best of the best of
performance in a handful of unusual
workloads and or who need more
single-threaded performance and many
many course that is offered by intel's
existing workstation or server products
however if you're a regular desktop user
or even a lightweight - mid-weight
workstation user it is very unlikely
that the W 30 195 X or whatever they
call it is going to provide any
additional value for you so we'd really
recommend sticking with something else
so that sound about right
okay cool
ah well thread reverse price-performance
is going to look pretty good yes even
with the what I thought were obscenely
expensive is $500 motherboards yep
da-da-da-da-da-da-da how many people are
watching this hotness
you guys are like you guys are soldiers
at this point because this has been
agonizing agonizing all around so many
things were painful to watch to
experience there we go
okay and almost 5 minutes 13 seconds
okay are we done
5 minutes 13 seconds
wait yeah why is that purple I did load
it from the network directly did that
bug things up a little
yep okay so this is a full minute and a
half faster than the 99 80 XE which was
the previous top of Intel's heap all
right so I think that is pretty much the
end of this marathon stream thank you
