stars just align perfectly for me we
were literally right in the middle of
planning a Wi-Fi upgrade so that we
could test the brand new Wi-Fi six
capabilities of the Samsung Galaxy S 10
series when our buds over at Cisco
reached out to sponsor a video
explaining the benefits of Wi-Fi 6 so we
were like ah so yeah you know that
beastly new access point well I think to
really show off the benefit of Wi-Fi 6
we'd probably need a couple of those not
ok yeah so done so today's video then is
all about what Wi-Fi 6 is why you might
care and when you can expect widespread
adoption and we're also gonna take it
for a test drive with the shiny new
Galaxy S 10 plus so strap in cuz this is
gonna be fun
while our ApS are being installed let's
talk about what is the same physically
the hardware for Wi-Fi 6 is actually
quite similar so on the client side cell
phone and other device manufacturers can
continue to lean on the antenna design
experience that they've gained from
previous generations of Wi-Fi with even
the battery consumption of new Wi-Fi 6
chipsets only expected to increase
during times of continuous high speed
data transfer and even then that's only
because the data rate is higher so
nothing really changes there as for the
deployment that's basically the same
remember your best practices for AP
positioning run your Ethernet and wire
everything up to your network switch
because Wi-Fi 6 is backwards compatible
any legacy clients on the network won't
even know the difference now let's talk
about what is different which is
basically everything starting with even
the name Wi-Fi is undergoing a much
needed and surprisingly sensible
rebranding right now from 802.11
something something for those curious by
the way this generation was going to be
called 802.11 a x2 simple numbered
generations so AC becomes 5 and becomes
4 and so on and so forth with these
little icons that are designed to inform
consumers which generation is supported
by both their client and the AP that
they happen to be connected to next up
is the deployment yeah ok it's not quite
the same
so Wi-Fi 6 handles more clients and more
cluttered environments better so you
might not actually need as many APs
which is nice but watch out because
you're not gonna be saving a buck here
each of those access points could be
handling multiple gigabits of data per
second across literally hundreds of
clients so your commodity gigabit p OE
sweet sweet your commodity gigabit POS
which isn't gonna cut it anymore
so we're moving to this maroc ems 355 24
X 2 it's 24
multi gigabit ports could actually be
fully loaded with mr 55 access points
thanks to its beefy 740 watt power
supply and this thing is rated at up to
640 gigabit per second of switching
capacity and all of that is important
because even though it's rated at a mere
39 percent faster throughput so about
600 megabit per second versus 433 on a
single 80 megahertz 5 gigahertz channel
thanks to packing more data into each
payload Wi-Fi 6 has some truly
game-changing features when it comes to
multi client access that are going to
result in far higher overall data rates
and less waiting so first of all access
points can be configured with up to an 8
by 8 antenna configuration so that is 8
for sending and 8 for receiving and on
top of that Wi-Fi 6 supports up to 8
concurrent downlink streams with
multi-user MIMO that is a huge increase
or the for concurrent downlink streams
that was supported with Wi-Fi 5 so this
widening of the highway so to speak is a
big part of what's gonna make Gen 6 so
critical to making Wi-Fi usable in large
venues like sports arenas and crowded
concert halls but it's not even close to
the entire picture the next huge
innovation for large-scale deployments
was actually borrowed from cellular
networks with Wi-Fi 6 the band or the
frequency range that would have made up
a traditional channel can be split using
a technique called orthogonal
frequency-division multiple access or
OFDM a so you know how one of the best
pro tips for anyone living in an
apartment is to use a scanner to see
what channel your neighbors are on and
then manually switch over to a different
one well forget about it
ofd ma allows each band be it 20 40 or
all the way up to 160 megahertz to be
split up into multiple chunks as many as
78 sub channels and each one of those
can be allocated to a separate client
now obvious
to make all of this work the access
point needs to get a little bit smarter
fortunately it did with Wi-Fi 6 an AP
can negotiate what are called
deterministic connections allowing it to
exercise a great deal of control over
the connected clients and how they're
allowed to behave so first a client gets
dynamically assigned however many
channels or sub channels can be spared
at that moment then things get even
crazier each client gets a schedule for
when it's allowed to transmit and
receive data now hold on a second I know
that in the computing world scheduling a
data transmission usually means
increased latency which is one of the
biggest issues with Wi-Fi today but in
practice what this means is less
collision mitigation overhead which
means that there's actually less waiting
around think of it kind of like a
perfectly executed zipper merge on the
highway so it will actually reduce
latency that means yes friends gaming on
Wi-Fi without lag spikes could actually
be a thing with Wi-Fi 6 go figure
another fun feature of deterministic
connections is that they can be used to
save power so you know you're connected
smart light switch your Anna's on button
your asset tags etc etc etc right now
they waste a ton of power constantly
checking in with the network hey you got
anything for me no ok how about now got
anything for me no ok well with
scheduled check-ins called target
wake-up time your devices can check-in
far less frequently dramatically
increasing their battery life the
coolest thing about Wi-Fi 6 though is
not the techie specs as much as I
personally get really amped on that
stuff rather it's the different
experiences that it enables like have
you ever tried to stealthily have a
video chat at the back of a lecture hall
or upload a video to YouTube from a
large event it's a total mess and I mean
even something as stupid as breaking for
lunch during a conference can absolutely
crush your mobile experience as everyone
jumps on Facebook at exactly the same
time well thanks to everything I've
talked about already
and actually a whole host of other new
features including better beamforming
spatial frequency reuse and dynamic
fragmentation which makes better use of
the available spectrum oh man actually I
forgot to mention that to down the line
we're even getting more spectrum in the
five to six gigahertz range that's gonna
be sweet
anyway the point is with all of this new
tech this is not like an incremental
generational evolutionary improvement
and you could even argue that this is
the biggest fundamental change that
we've seen yet for Wi-Fi and I for one
and stoked but it's always a but isn't
there the one buzzkill today
is that while Wi-Fi 6 is backwards
compatible you're gonna have to wait a
little while longer for the kick ass
experience that I've talked about here
because the promises of Wi-Fi 6 can only
be fully realized once client devices
with support for these new features
start to overtake their legacy
counterparts now the good news is that
at least they're already showing up so
all that's left in this video then is to
take our S 10 plus for a quick test
drive now one problem I have is that we
don't have a couple hundred of these so
I'm not going to be able to do like a
mega and client test or anything like
that but we can at least make sure that
everything's working properly here in
the office with a quick speed test so
without further ado let's see just how
fast we can make this go so the first
thing that I noticed just connecting to
our new access points is that remember
those little icons I told you guys about
it's right there at the top of the phone
Wi-Fi 6 so you'll know that you're
negotiating your link using the correct
generation of the technology so that's
pretty cool then for us remember we just
upgraded to 10 gigabit internet so as
long as we can find a speed test server
that can take the burn then all we got
to do is run a simple speed test here
and have a look at what kind of speeds
that we can get and I have never seen
anything like this that upload speed 800
megabit per second guys not only is this
Wi-Fi
this is Wi-Fi on a mobile device this is
a 2 by 2 antenna configuration that is
real-world speeds of like 800 we're
getting close to if I actually plug the
USB type-c dongle into my phone and
plugged it into the wall that's
absolutely incredible and like I said
before it is absolutely just the tip of
the iceberg so thanks for watching guys
thanks to Cisco for sponsoring this

hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
