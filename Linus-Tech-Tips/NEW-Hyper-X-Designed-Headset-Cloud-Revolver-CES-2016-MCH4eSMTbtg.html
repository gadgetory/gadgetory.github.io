checking out another headset it's not
the cloud to stay tuned to check out
what it is thank you to Squarespace for
bringing us the CES 2016 this year check
out that link in the video description
down below this is the cloud revolver
series of headsets it comes in two
models just the normal revolver and the
revolver s the normal revolver is a 3.5
millimeter base the wreck into your
computer kind of system the revolver s
has a USB sound card and Dolby 7.1 both
headsets feature a long braided cable
the cloud revolver non s features a
inline volume control and mic mute the
cloud revolver S version features a
inline volume control mic volume control
mic beaut Dolby toggle and EQ switcher
that EQ switcher has three different
modes those three different modes are
bass boost flat and vocal and they
indicate which one is currently selected
based on LEDs on the controller so
there's no guessing going on speaking of
the microphone there's a detachable mic
that doesn't really immediately look
like a detachable mic which is probably
a good thing it also as an adjustable
boom on it so that you can put it
wherever you want it like the corner of
your mouth where it's kind of supposed
to go and they claim that they have
worked on the actual mic within the boom
quite a bit so it should sound good of
course we can't really do any testing
here but maybe we'll get our hands on
them someday for the construction of the
actual headphones themselves there's a
steel frame going around a rigid frame
for the outer part of the headphones and
then there's a suspended band on the
inside so there's a soft bit on your
head so you're going putting your head
directly on steel these leatherette
that's used is the same that's used in
the cloud too so it's actually
relatively comfy and if you tried the
cloud Tucson before you'll probably know
somewhat of how that will feel in terms
of audio quality they're featuring 50
millimeter angled drivers for a more
interesting sound floor and they are
considered closed back headphones but
there are little holes cut in the front
and the back they let them breathe a
little bit more so they sound kind of
like an in-between I guess it needs some
more testing on that but we'll see now I
know a lot of you guys are fans of the
cloud twos and this might seem kind of
interesting because this is the first
time they've moved quite a bit away from
the original cloud one ID
that's because HyperX actually developed
these entirely
house this project has apparently been
going on for longer than the original
release of the cloud 1 they've been
planning on making this for a really
long time so I am sure that they're
interested in your feedback considering
how much they were hounding me for it
while I was here so let them know on
Twitter let me know in the comments down
below thanks to Squarespace for bringing
us here to CES 2016 if you need a
website they can hook you up they have a
whole bunch of different template models
and they can make anything look
beautiful
they also have something like their
commerce module if you need to say sell
some we'll look we've got carpet here
this is wonderful high-grade carpet it
feels absolutely amazing if you need to
vendor this kind of stuff and have a
commerce module you definitely could
through their system so I don't know if
you have any troubles with it you can
use their 24/7 live chat support and
email support you even might be able to
interest them in some carpets I'm not
sure if their support team needs new
carpets in their living room I don't
know maybe don't bug them with that so
they don't get really pissed off of me
anyways thanks Squarespace Squarespace
build it beautiful if you guys want to
see more or CES content so let's go over
line Detectives yeah I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
