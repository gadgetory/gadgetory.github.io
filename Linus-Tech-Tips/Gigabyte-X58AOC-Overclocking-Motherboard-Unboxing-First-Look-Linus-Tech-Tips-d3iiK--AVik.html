find a gigabyte motherboard that is not
advertised as overclockable and with
overclocking features however the x58 a
- OC is the first board they've released
that is pretty much strictly for
overclocking so they have their gamer
series which is the g1 series so you've
got the assassin the sniper and the
gorilla and then this is the OC series
so it might not have some of the
features that gamers might like such as
you know the third-party chips for land
as well as audio but what it does have
is a ground-up design not like ground up
like your are like this but from the
ground level up to the top design for
overclocking so this is an X 58 board
which means it supports Intel Core i7
processors on LGA 1366 here we will find
okay little OC shield not much on that
side not much over here don't forget
that does include core i7 extreme 6 core
processors on the back we will find a
ton of different features and whatnots
Meg gigabyte has to say now when they
before this board was released actually
it's the long-standing x58 tradition of
overclocking had been turned on its here
because they were able to achieve a
previously unheard of that is a
world-record overclock on this board in
spite of the fact that this platform has
been around since pretty much forever
it's been like a couple years now so
there's been a lot of time for
overclockers and the engineers at the
motherboard companies to get familiar
with the platform and even so gigabyte
has managed to release a board that
outperformed everything else when we're
talking strictly overclocking so here we
have a crossfire bridge here we have an
SLI bridge here we have a 3-way SLI
bridge because if you're an extreme
overclockers it's gonna be using a board
like this you probably will need one
okay we've got 2 SATA
six gigabit of rather bill run on SATA 6
gigabits per second but this is not
there SATA 6 part number so to
right-angles SATA cables to straight to
SATA cables we have a rear i/o shield
now check that out there's almost no
stuff coming out of the back of the
board because this is a in some ways a
bare-bones board that is designed as I
said for one purpose only
you've got voltage check readouts here
so you can use these to use a multimeter
to manually check the voltages to
various parts of the system very
important especially if you're doing any
V modding gigabyte sticker for the front
of your test bench in all likelihood
because this won't go in a case we've
got a gigabyte utility DVD as well as a
user's manual though if you're buying
this board you probably don't need to
user's manual all right let's close this
up and have a look at the board itself
now it's been quite a while since I've
seen a board with as appealing an
aesthetic scheme as the x58 a OC
outstanding this is by far the
best-looking board I've seen probably
since I'd say since DF eyes socket 478
stuff because I love the orange and
black Halloween color scheme it's it's
really easy to find UV orange stuff to
go with it whether it's fans or water
cooling or whatever the case may be so
if you were gonna use this in in like a
real daily driver machine versus just
strictly for overclocking competition it
would look so cool okay so anyway I'm
done gushing now so let's go ahead and
have a look at the overall layout of the
board and then we'll talk about some of
the special features so I'll start with
the CPU socket this is a load socket so
you're not going to have any of those
burn problems that were experienced with
some of the Foxconn sockets that's
that's just well it's a little thing you
know do care and attention being paid to
the target market for this board we have
here so I'm gonna cheat I'm going to
look at the backboard so gigabyte claims
output from the CPU socket is up to 1200
watts now if you managed to make a CPU
consume 12
hundred watts then you're some kind of
wizard but the point is that this board
is completely over built
so they're using driver MOSFETs there's
their chokes are rated if single chokes
are rated up to 50 amps okay it's let me
see
okay the PWM frequency goes up to a 1000
Hertz excellent you've got two 8-pin EPS
power connectors okay so these are up
here and their ideal location along the
top left edge of the board and actually
give me one moment here also of note is
the fact that the CPU socket area is
extremely clutter free so this makes
insulating around the CPU much easier
when you're using liquid nitrogen or dry
ice cooling or any other exotic cooling
methods to cool the CPU itself because
you don't want that condensation ending
up on the board any more than is
absolutely necessary okay so we've got
support for dual triple channel ddr3
memory you can see all those slots here
I'm actually going to get into what all
of this area is for a little bit later
but we've got our 24 pin ATX power
connector exactly where it belongs along
the right-hand edge we have here we go
six say two to three gigabit per second
ports and to say two three six gigabit
per second ports and I'll get into what
these are for in a little bit as well we
have all of our front panel connectors
here we have our front USB including
on/off charge so that means you can
charge your devices even when the system
is powered off they're claiming up to 40
percent faster as well which is frames
there's your front audio okay and we
don't see anything special in terms of
the audio chips being used or the land
the land chips being used it looks like
just real tech chips so nothing special
there as ice' mentioned before this is
not for that this is for overclocking
serious business so we have dual
graphics support in 16 X 16 X mode or
quad graphics support in 8 X 8 X 8 X 8 X
mode so there are no additional chips
that means no an F 200 chips no lucid
hydrologic chips nothing like that
this is in order to make sure that
there's this little latency as
possible it's yet to be proven in any
meaningful way that those additional
chips and they bandwidth they provide
are able to improve benchmark scores so
that's why they have opted to not
include those on this board we have one
PCI slot so if you need one you have one
and then moving right along we have an
extremely beefy cooling solution for the
North Bridge as well as for the power
delivery system it's also LED lit so you
can see the power cables here and here
so these strips right here are actually
going to light up and this one right
here actually lights up so the board
should look really cool when it's
powered on but that's just an aesthetic
thing so what I'm talking about here is
just the fact that these have very very
be feeling aluminum heat sinks it's
going to give you a lot of room for heat
dissipation although some of the more
extreme overclockers may even just
remove the whole whack and put a pot on
the Northbridge itself so they've
thoughtfully made the south bridge of
North Bridge heat sinks completely
separate they haven't connected them via
a heat pipe in order to make that
possible all right so let's talk about
this neighborhood up actually no let's
talk about this first so here we've got
C Mo's clear switch as well as a BIOS
selector switch actually hold on is that
the bio selector switch I might be a
little bit confused okay give me a sec
sorry guys this is the PWM frequency
switch so you can go from 600 to 800 to
1,000 Hertz very easily up here all
right all these buttons over here all
have different functionalities so this
is the OC gear so what that means is
that the frequency up and frequency down
buttons RI they're going to go up and
down by one megahertz or 0.3 megahertz
so if you change the gear it changes how
fine the control you have over the base
clock is this button right here is just
a one-button overclock so it just sets
the CPU to 4 gigahertz on the next boot
this is pretty self-explanatory
that's the CPU ratio up or down with the
press of a button so there is no delay
this is just a plain and simple hardware
adjusting button awesome we've got a
our switch as well as a reset switch and
here are all our voltage measurements so
you can use the little plugs that came
with it here I'll show you guys that
again so you can see how they go in yeah
here you go and then the other ends of
these are compatible with your
multimeter so you can use the leads on
there to check the voltages to a variety
of things so you can check the qpi PLL
vm CH core CPU PLL DDR v TT the vm bqbi
v TT as well as the the core so that's
all of your critical ones right there
we've also got an LED post indicator so
that'll help with any troubleshooting
that you may have to do with this board
while it's being benchmarked we've also
got a couple other things here so this
is smart right here two SATA power
connectors now what are those for I am
so sick of seeing auxiliary power
connectors on motherboards that are
molex because I don't know about you
guys but I actually don't have anything
that plugs in in my system anymore via
molex except my water cooling pump my
water cooling pump is nowhere near my
motherboard so what that means is that I
have to run a completely separate module
modular cable up to my motherboard if I
want to plug that auxilary power in it's
stupid this is smart
this is SATA power connectors near SATA
data connectors so what that means is
wherever you're running these is
probably reasonably close probably near
the front of your case which is where
most cases mount the hard drives to
where you're already running SATA power
so you run an additional cable or you
run a cable to a drive and then the
other two harnesses over to here great
now you've got your axillary power being
provided by SATA so that's that's
awesome love that okay let me just see
if there's anything that I am missing
here actually give me a sec two more
things actually yeah so gigabyte it
actually says that you can and by that I
guess they mean they recommend you use
two different rails on your power supply
for these so that way you're not going
to run into any limitations in terms of
how much power you can provide to the
PCI Express slots the other thing is
that they have specifically designed the
PCI Express slots with all low profile
components in between them also the
spacing where
don't have slots here and here allows
you to very easily insulate in between
the PCI Express graphic slots for the
best
sub-zero performance and the most safety
because you don't want to ruin those
expensive and sometimes heavily modified
graphics cards it's a real pain to redo
all of that work last but not least here
is the bios switch so you can switch
between bios one and two this allows you
to save up to sixteen BIOS profiles it
also allows you to control and there's a
little LED indicator to show you which
one you're using on there but it allows
you to control which BIOS you are using
and you can even okay you can switch and
you can flash to a new beta bios find
out if that works better for you turns
out it doesn't great switch back to your
old bios you've got your stable settings
no problem very cool feature don't
