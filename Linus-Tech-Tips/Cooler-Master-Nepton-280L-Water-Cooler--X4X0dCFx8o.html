continues a happy trend that we've seen
developing recently it takes the status
quo that is radiators designed for 120
millimeter fans and amps it up a notch
it uses two
140 millimeter Coolermaster jet flow
fans to cover the massive surface area
of its 280 millimeter long radiator
speaking of status quo
instead of rebranding a design from ASA
Tucker kulit Coolermaster uses their own
pump and ultrafine micro channel water
block design giving them full control
over the performance and quality of
these components but does it translate
into the real world I guess we'll find
out with its factory tuning and data
center DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is
an amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts so I'm going to
start this off with a couple of things
that I actually don't really like about
this their jet flow fans have great
specs but and this goes for all liquid
cooling manufacturers why do they have
rounded frames see this gap see this gap
right here we did a test on another
liquid cooler that uses pressure
optimized round frame fins where we use
duct tape to cover the gaps and guess
what we've got a couple degrees lower
temperatures for our effort because duct
tape for sealing gaps to achieve optimal
air flow please no gaps
please Coolermaster and everyone else
for that matter square frame fans for
radiators that is Linus law number 347
anyways there's another one use of an
all aluminum radiator is something that
hardcore liquid cooling purists might
not like but the system is completely
sealed and uses extra thick fep tubing
3/8 inch tubing by the way to prevent
the slow evaporation that can occur with
porous tubing so since you'll never open
it and there's an appropriate anti
corrosive coolant inside it won't be a
problem because metals aren't actually
in contact with each other while it
isn't a problem however it does mean
some of the performance of the system is
left on the table compared to if it had
the surface area does and used a copper
and brass design like Coolermaster zone
glacier 240 L which performed similarly
and also happens to be fully expandable
I apologize in advance for not having it
in our performance charts though I stole
it from Luke's testing stable because I
wanted it for my liquid cooling video
card test bench sometime ago anyway
about the aluminum rad I'll say this
though at least coolermaster doesn't
hide it I couldn't find the radiator
material of the H 110 anywhere in
Corsairs official literature and had to
go hunting to see what they were using
installing the two ad l in my standard
case the c 70 was actually a little bit
tricky the fill port sticks out on the
bottom if you don't put the fans on the
bottom and that makes it so that you're
probably going to hit your 8 pin power
we actually split that into a four pin
and allowed it to dodge the fill port
which helped a lot but then again in
their recommended configuration with the
fans on the bottom not the fans on the
top like we do it fits a lot better we
also had problems with the radiator
hitting other different parts of the
case but again if you put the fans on
the bottom like they recommend you don't
have that problem although we do prefer
putting it on top we do this with every
single radio that comes in here and we
find that it standardizes the whole
process in terms of performance we found
that the cooler performs within margin
of error of an H 110 and considering the
the margin area that comes with our
thermal test mentions we don't have a
thermally controlled room that's fairly
realistic as these radiators are quite
similar so in conclusion if you're
looking for a liquid cooling unit that's
got good looks with its white LED
lighting FX comes with a fantastic five
year warranty and features compatibility
for both 140 millimeter and 120
millimeter fans although the 120
millimeter fans will seal even less
against the radiator then the Neptune
280 L is a solid choice compared to the
more traditional dual 120 millimeter
radiator designs on the market just make
sure that your case has room for it guys

thanks for watching this video and don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
we're on boxing's reviews and other
computer videos and just in case you
missed it before yes that is the
difference in size between dual 140 ml
and dual 120 mil it doesn't sound like
that much
it sounds like 20 mil which could be
volume 20 milliliters</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
