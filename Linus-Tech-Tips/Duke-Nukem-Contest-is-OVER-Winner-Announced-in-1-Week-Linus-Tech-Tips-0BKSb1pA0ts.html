this one but I am announcing the end of
the Duke Nukem contest I'm not accepting
any more entries but what I do need you
guys to do is potentially okay remember
the prize is for a gtx 580 matrix card
from the sous if i can find where i
actually show it saw 3d monitor and 3d
glasses with a copy of duke nukem
forever okay that 3d glasses that's me
talking about them okay so what I do
need you guys to do is there was a bit
of a bug with YouTube during this
contest so besides me having my account
hijacked there was also a bug with video
responses so going into this video I can
clearly see here that I only have about
97 video responses if I go in to see all
however it took me about two seconds to
find the video response here that are
here rather here's one from ping pong
pyro who is one of the outstanding
entrance from the first contest that is
actually not in the video responses here
in spite of the fact that i have
accepted all of the video responses that
i received so if we go here came yeah
he's not on page one control f king okay
so that's what it is but that's a
different one and there's no other one
so what I need you guys to do is go
through the video responses that you see
here and if your video is not there
please resubmit it so that I don't miss
it I want to make sure that when i'm
doing the judging here I don't miss any
entries so I'm going to try and have a
winner announced listen let's say i'll
give you guys a week to make sure your
videos there so we'll announce the
winner on sep tember the 16th will be
the winning announcement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
