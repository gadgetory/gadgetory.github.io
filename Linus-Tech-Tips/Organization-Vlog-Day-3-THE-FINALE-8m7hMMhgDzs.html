involve the label maker and bins and
stuff so priority number two then is

put together and lay out all of the
racking for the upstairs writing tent
so those are the main tasks today this
thing out here all day
G skills km7 ADR mechanical keyboard
features a brushed aluminum top plate on
the fly Mac for recording and various
Cherry MX key switch configurations
learn more at the link below so in
December of last year
we made a very large order at hive
lighting that has taken up till now to
arrive we got five of these wasp 100 C's
and we just got there
plus 1000 head which is a gigantic light
and will be this bold kampala we have
ever owned and I'm so excited
Brandon I found it the monitor with the
mount on the back maybe you were also
look out close to my finger I've already
done a script review and shot a fat with
John and I've shot an LTTE and it's only
11:15 the clocks gone nice
this was the the free pile so we still
have the server rack but the ugly clock
is gone that's great that's like lies
gone too
excellent the system works I'm helping
you
we are gonna be bringing stuff upstairs
and assembling right yeah I do have the
planning on the plan you know the
five-year plan that shelf is looking
pretty good
except you know it's missing all the
wood sharpness oh whoa look at that
timing as your office oh pretty good I'm
trying to get everything absolutely
plugged in because I have a very
important call in like half an hour and
so far I have an attorney thing going on
so that's a bad sign kinda hard getting
used to all these different
pretty amazing yeah it's a palace
amazing as an Ewok DIY Shelby project be
cool bill that's good that was real good
do you need help no um or maybe I could
take away this cardboard that's in your
way
yeah yeah see when the cameras rolling I
got to pretend to be comfortable like I
don't just sit in my office and do CEO
things so you look at me I'm moving
cardboard it makes me more human and
relatable to the rookies so good news
I absolutely just heard from the guy
who's uh who's I think it's a Dodge
something starts with the seat anyway
whatever the car that we've been storing
over here till he runs a construction
company hey thanks for storing my car I
saw you guys were you know working in
totally unsafe conditions on that janky
orange ladder and he offered to build us
some stairs and a railing for that thing
all they gonna do is supply the building
materials that's frickin sick stoked
stoked right now I feel like my entire
life is moving boxes from one shelf to
the other and then back to the other
shelf
it's like being Sisyphus but with less
interesting reversal should I just start
putting these into plugs and then we
could take about as neatly hold on first
we have we have a lot of mystery to
solve
I'm just wondering who it is on staff
that can't count 1314 keen say-so
sixty trying to figure out how we're
gonna store our lights which is really
like I don't think they should be stored
here at all so the funny thing about all
this is that Brendan signed off on this
storage area
this place looks messier than it was
before
well you know what all this crap here
Brandon took everything here all these
bags all these like pelican style cases
all along there Brandon had all this
stuff literally piled up behind all the
sets so Max and I are looking at all the
filming stuff going on yeah let's just
put all they'll put everything here
there's like a random full garbage can
back here just like someone was like oh
I got I could empty this but no I'm just
gonna stick it behind the set where
nobody will ever find it you did that I
don't know what is all this stuff
traditions remember the Christmas album
decorate with I am claiming the shelf
closest to the door see that I won't
have to walk as far CEO privilege man
it's a generalization but I'm pretty
sure all females and all Japanese people
have really nice writing I'm both of
those see not even doing anything
I am exercising I'm moving stuff can you
tell no I have move oh this section oh
yeah that's a lot of amazing stuff right
there yeah
why do you always have your shirt off is
so hot
right but I'm in the same place you are
doing the same thing you are but you
have fun here you're from a
hotter place you could have had a weaker
argument I just want to get shut up
every year movie stuff is my naked time
where's your shirt man surrett skis a
jet ski okay Wow I need some water maybe
something stronger you don't drink
I know but that doesn't mean I can't
need it hello I am organizing this fine
workshop as you saw earlier and finding
stuff was basically impossible now it's
only marginally impossible do you want
to know a little secret yesterday Linus
told me that I had to throw the engine
and everything about it
and I said I was making the executive
decision that the crankshaft was cool so
let's try and find out how long it takes
him to notice that it's right there I
think it's wicked in the camera hmm
here I'm gonna go film somebody you have
camera operated you know what
I'll burn your house down
John how's the organization doing well
that's all we need
it's just gonna be a white up and safety
everything's on wheels oh those things
put them all here nice but we need to
clear this space person- said how do you
get rid of all this said I was gonna get
rid of all of it like three o'clock and
when show starts in an hour and I don't
think that he's gonna have time to do
that removing the windshield set all at
once it's gonna be great
we're not gonna break anything I swear
[Laughter]
okay guys keep up the good work
everybody's doing a great job over there
I'm just gonna listen to me how's your
review going let's mess with turn this
mess will turn you ready for this isn't
like in stress we were doing so great
too with not like that's why Lansing we
don't put live on the ground that's why
I broke the up number yeah what is not
cheap day three organization this was
just all shelves and now it's only
partly shelves honestly after three days
of this lake we've made a lot of
progress to be very clear like check out
this workshop
pretty much everything is where it's
supposed to be actually all this space
is open here when show has moved over
into that corner I'm leaving for the
weekend so this camera really needs to
turn on all these props and stuff this
still needs to move but camera equipment
land has improved a ton to the point
where people actually like know where to
put these lights other than just on a
light stand on a set somewhere
theoretically the power adaptors for
them are late okay like I said there's
still some work still some work to be
done
see Sanders on a c-stand cart light
stands tripods in the tripod cart this
corner is all the writers crap so this
is all are like Ethernet cables and like
you know the PC power cables Intel stock
cooler so you can easily get it all that
stuff now which is again a huge
improvement we've totally changed the
organization system for in-progress
project so every writer gets a half of
one of these big shelves and then
anytime they start something we've got a
bin they write on it who's it for what's
it for and it either lives on these
shelves or upstairs where I'm just
finished actually so yes receiving also
still needs a ton of work but I'm all
I'm out all next week but Tyler will be
here so he'll be chipping away at that
we've moved all the oversized stuff over
to 101 yeah there's still some more
organization but I can find you stuff
that looks good see like this looks
pretty good right looks pretty organized
we didn't pass our final inspection
today
so we can't put our roof hanging shelves
up yet so we can't involve our empty
boxes up out of the way but the new
office has been mostly moved into which
is pretty second there's still some more
construction and stuff like we didn't
plan for a light in this hallway
beverage added bean bag meeting areas
sick AF mix off this which is like looks
so empty because you have so little
spout yeah you need more stuff you more
stuff dude well how many thousands of
dollars do I have to spend on stuff zero
because we just spent it all on you
having an office with like eight windows
you have more windows than I have then
there's Luke's office he commandeered
some beanbag chairs for having meetings
so that's pretty sick oh yeah Colton did
not end up near the electrical thing how
does Colton have the biggest office in
alright and then this is the new and
this is the new and improved writing den
so every writer gets their own ok this
is not the plan that we had talked about
so I'm actually not sure what the heck
is going on up here Ivan and I work sure
what was supposed to happen so we did
this excellent
okay well then there'll be some more
work to be done on this next week but
the theory is every writer gets their
own shelf space for their own ongoing
projects up here as well I think Ivan is
going to be living in like in like a
cage like ok so with those times I
remember yeah looks office exact I got
the corner office John also has this
laid out incorrectly he actually only
gets this space here and then where
might be putting like racking on for
but it was worth a shot
rip the one place that didn't get
touched is my office
