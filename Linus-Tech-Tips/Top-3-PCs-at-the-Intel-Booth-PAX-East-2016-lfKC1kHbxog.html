sending us to PAX East 2016 this year to
check out all of their stuff check out
the link in the video description down
below alright guys welcome to the Intel
booth we're checking out the top three
computers at the Intel booth I know we
usually do like top 5 desktops or
whatever but today top 3 computers there
will be two computers like desktop
computers and one laptop well we're
gonna start with is from main gear and
it is beautiful it is also expensive at
over $6,000 but yeah anyways so in terms
of specs it has an i7 6700 K processor
from Intel 16 gigabytes of HyperX memory
a 750 series 400 gigabyte nvme SSD a
Maximus 8 jean motherboard it has EK
water blocks to 360 rad 360 millimeter
rad and a corsair a x8 60 watt power
supply in terms of aesthetics what
you're looking at is LeMans blue on the
outside of the case and within certain
other aesthetic components we looking at
nickel-plated brass tubing throughout
the cable wiring that they do is called
origami - like a products name but it
does look quite beautiful they've done a
great job with the management and the
overall aesthetic of the cables as well
one thing to note here is that the 750
series nvme SSD is also water-cooled
which is actually pretty insane those
things do get pretty hot that's why you
do see fairly large heat sinks on them
so seeing one that's water-cooled is
actually kind of cool is it really gonna
change anything no but it might add
longevity maybe possibly it does look
really cool regardless next up is
Cybertron they have a beautiful-looking
case with a really interesting red and
black mixed aesthetic going all around
it the art on this thing is fantastic it
is also hardline but not a metal hard
line and has a red and white overall
look on the inside they are also using
EK water blocks and they're using
Thermaltake fans for the more general
main components they have a core i7 6700
K citizen gigabytes of ddr4 24 hundred
megahertz member
from HyperX uh 980ti sli system although
the bridge is missing that was removed
because vr sli is kind of having some
problems with vibe right now it doesn't
really work that great and actually
running in sli results in a massive drop
in overall framerate
so they're running a single card even
though there are two cards in here it
also has a 750 series nvme SSD and a
gigabyte g1 gaming motherboard for a
power supply is running in HX 1200 i so
you're fine in terms of power for a
laptop we have one it is the msi gt72 s
as an i7 6820 HK in it 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory an Intel wireless AC killer
LAN G sig IPS 1080p display which is
fantastic jisuk on a laptop faced with
great Thunderbolt 3 and a 730 series 240
gigabyte SSD now what I didn't mention
is its graphics card it does have a
desktop 980 in it and that is one of the
reasons what is the only current HTC
vive like a certified laptop now you
might be aware that there are other
laptops that would definitely be capable
of running a vibe that is partially
because not all of them have been pushed
through the certification process yet
but I didn't want to call this laptop
out because that is pretty snake
regardless in terms of i/o starting on
the back you have a USB type-c 3.1
connector Ethernet power HDMI and
Thunderbolt on the right-hand side you
have a blu-ray drive and two USB 3.0
ports on the left-hand side you have an
SD card slot for audio jacks and four
USB 3.0 ports now you guys were talking
