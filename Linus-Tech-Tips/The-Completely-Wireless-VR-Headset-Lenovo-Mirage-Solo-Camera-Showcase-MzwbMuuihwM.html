experiences and I'm sure there are quite
a few of you out there that feel the
same but the investment required to
getting good VR experience can be pretty
big it's definitely a barrier of entry
for a lot of people who'd like to get
into the arc so when Lenovo reached out
about doing a sponsored showcase of
their Mirage solo daydream VR headset
and their Mirage camera I was intrigued
it's got two cameras on the front here
and this is something that we've seen
before in Windows mixed reality headsets
but it's also completely self-contained
with no wires or separate PC required so
let's take a look it's not actually on
yet we're just gonna roll the animated
intro for now
let's put the camera aside for now and
start off with the Mirage so the headset
this is the world's first stand-alone
daydream head-mounted display in the
past all daydream headsets were
essentially a shell with lenses that you
could slide your daydream compatible
phone into side note here Google only
actually lists 10 phones as daydream
compatible on their website three of
which are pixel devices so if you want
to go that route make sure you double
check that list with the Mirage headset
none of that matters it has its own
built-in computer phone thing to do all
of the rendering so stand alone means
there's no trip hazard wires all over
the place and no external sensors that
you have to drill into your wall or
mount to your desk or whatever and as a
side bonus you won't drain the battery
of your actual phone like you would with
a Google cardboard you know in case your
mom calls or whatever the exterior is
made of like a soft touch off-white
plastic with padding here here and here
and then it's got this dual action
adjustability with the button on the
bottom and the knob at the back to
accommodate really pretty much for its
the highs of noggin look at i/o in specs
are about what you'd expect for a modern
computer phone a modern thing with a USB
type-c port on the side for charging 64
gigs of internal storage and microSD
expansion of up to 256 gigs the other
side then features a power button
we have status LED and volume controls
and a headphone jack it also comes with
a little daydream remote up there it is
that while fairly simple in design works
pretty well for the types of games that
you'll be playing on a device like this
which I guess means it's time to get
started I'm gonna fire up some Blade
Runner here so most of that seems pretty
normal so far for a VR headset so while
Jake's getting Bladerunner fired up I
want to talk you guys through what's
really different here the front is where
things get really interesting sorry here
you go
so the mirages duel 13 megapixel
front-facing cameras power some new tech
from Google called world sense so in
combination with the usual internal
inertial sensors like a gyroscope and a
magnetometer magnetic meter magnetometer
magnetized is that right and a
magnetometer these cameras allow for six
degrees of freedom of movement that
means the headset not only tracks your
head but also walking dodging leaning
whatever you can pretty much move
however you want and information
collected from the cameras should allow
the headset to keep track of where you
are because even the best gyroscope is
going to be subject to some degree of
drift
now if you do obstruct the view of the
cameras or the room is too dark world
sense will automatically fall back to
tracking just your head then once the
cameras vision improves it resumes full
spatial tracking and can even remember
where you were it's pretty darn cool you
have a setup yet I know how to do that
and the world's biggest professional
about time we have accomplished more
than any other Media Group hey I'm happy
for you alright
you can try the Eclipse game well
writers I don't you try stand-up I feel
like this is definitely a better game to
be standing up I sure okay you want to
reset your view I mean it's definitely
still powered by phone graphics like I
don't want to set unrealistic
expectations for people and the tracking
the tracking is what impresses me
compared to other phone based VR
solutions that I've tried before so this
one's pretty cool and a couple of the
other games that kind of stood out over
the last week or so are fire escape and
then Blade Runner revelations depending
on whether you're more into puzzle
solving action or orb story now with
that said if educational content is more
your gem the BBC actually created an
incredible underwater exploration of the
California coast and Google has
a tech demo that they're calling audio
factory now it's mostly just a showcase
for simulated spatial sound but it's
also a good bit of fun especially since
it's free also for the non-gamers
YouTube VR can be a great reason to try
out VR I mean everyone knows I think
already that you can watch regular
videos I think sdt like they're on a big
screen but there's also thousands of
existing VR 180 and VR 360 videos on the
platform and next VR even lets you watch
NBA League Pass games courtside in VR
and we're adding one more thing that you
might want to watch where is it ah thank
you this is the Mirage camera so it's a
lightweight point-and-shoot style VR 180
camera featuring dual 13 megapixel
wide-angle camera is capable of shooting
30 FPS 4k vr1 80 video so it supports
either saving content directly to your
phone as a 2d video uploading it
straight to YouTube or even
live-streaming at up to 4k VR 180
also to YouTube without any
configuration required whatsoever so we
are gonna be using this to do a VR tour
of our office that you'll be able to
watch over on the Lenovo YouTube channel
now the idea behind recording 180
degrees rather than 360 is that it
doesn't require image stitching which
improves the image quality and it can
help with both ensuring that people
don't interfere with what you're trying
to film and maintaining the focus of
your viewers the are 180 can also be
used to provide a super cool stereo 3d
experience when you watch the footage
back on a VR headset it's actually
really trippy go check out the VR 180
studio tour that we made in partnership
with Lenovo we're gonna have that linked
in the video description and it is best
viewed with the head mounted display
like the Mirage headset or a Google
cardboard so if you have one try it out
and then after that if you're interested
in picking up a mirage solo headset or
the Mirage camera check out the links in
the description and then we also have
links down there to a couple of other
creators who also made videos on the two
devices we featured today
so thanks again to Lenovo for sponsoring
this video thanks to you guys for
watching if you dislike this video you
can hit that button but if you liked it
hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description okay I kind of already
said that but it's part of the standard
outro what am I going to do at this
point all sit down there's armored
storage has cool shirts like this one
and our community forum which you should
definitely join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
