that I haven't really gotten into much
the last time I bought one was back
around the release of the first Hawks
game since I'm more into arcade flight
than sim flight incidentally it was a
Saitek aviator 0:01 and it ended up
being the main reason I didn't really
get into that game because it felt like
such a shoddy piece of kit compared to
my old Thrustmaster Top Gun
the only other joystick I've ever owned
which I only actually replaced because
it requires a game port but with elite
dangerous being dangerously fun and star
citizen coming eventually we hope I felt
like it was time to jump in and jump
hard with the X 55 Rhino the
top-of-the-line flight sim accessory
from say tech
Corsairs h ATI GT in each 100 GTX all in
one liquid coolers improve both the
appearance and cooling of your PC click
my face to learn more so let's get this
out of the way this puppy not cheap it
costs more than the Moto e 2nd gen cell
phone review that I'm working on well it
doesn't cost more than the review it
cost more on the phone but you guys get
the point and while it certainly packs a
wallop in terms of features my initial
impressions of it actually weren't
entirely positive opening up the package
I was greeted by environmentally
friendly paper-based packaging the
separate flight stick and throttle units
that together make up the hotels or
hands on throttle and stickiness of the
device some documentation and three
optional Springs which combined with the
one that comes pre-installed and the
option to go bareback gives the user the
ability to adjust the tension of the
stick to five different levels without
any tools or special modifications the
stick assembly was easy just pop it in
place so the contacts line up and
tighten the ring plug in the two USB
cables install the software from the say
Tech's site and you're ready to rock
sounds good so far Linus what didn't you
like well honestly the biggest thing is
that for $200 I expected something a
little more substantial feeling I can
forgive the noticeable clunk that exists
when centering the stick thanks to the
spring tensioning system but the flex
that even my weak hands can detect in
the plastic of the stick shaft and the
sheer lightweightness
of the unit just don't feel like I just
spent $200 on something honestly say Tek
probably could have impressed me by
simply putting lead plates in the bottom
of these because then at least I could
actually use them at all without bolting
them to my flight cockpit or desk
something that's not convenient for
everyone but all of that above stuff was
for the most part feelings and looking
at this objectively I don't see any
better options on the market at this
price point with more premium feeling
HOTAS units like the warthog from fresh
master costing about twice as much so
let's see if I can get over these
feelings and appreciate the
functionality of the X 55 Rhino
boy does it ever have a lot of it the
software is a touch on the buggy side
and crashes from time to time even when
doing something completely unrelated to
the stick like writing this review but
it never happened in game and it's
pretty easy to use allowing everything
from Universal dead zone configuration
and response curve adjustments to
remapping buttons to macros that can
include keyboard and mouse inputs on the
aforementioned buttons
did I mention buttons buttons buttons
buttons button button button buttons did
I mention buttons let's start with the
stick excluding the twisty rudder
control something that I wish had a
simple lock for games that don't support
it that would be nice but including the
four-way hats which this mama has 18
discrete inputs about two-thirds of
which I can reach without too much
effort while flying in spite of my baby
sized hands and the decidedly grown-man
sized stick they're trying desperately
to handle the sheer number of inputs
combined with the good to excellent
tactile feel of the switches across the
board is a definite selling point of
this stick even without the throttle you
can find almost anything you'd need to
do in an arcade style game to the stick
alone which I guess leads us over to the
throttle my favorite piece of this
product unlike the joystick I didn't
find the throttles construction
disappointing if your air or spacecraft
has separate engines on each side the
left and right portion of the throttle
can be controlled independently or you
can lock them together the tension of
the throttle can be adjusted via dial on
the side and while it was too stiff out
of the box after about 5 minutes I was
able to get it configured just right for
me which brings us to buttons again
o-m-g flatten button button buttons
truthfully I may have lost count at some
point because with all the toggles and
buttons I counted 34 discrete inputs
plus the 5 rotary inputs plus the three
separate modes that can be accessed with
the switch at the bottom left I mean
landing gear countermeasures silent
flight mode seatbelt
no smoking light if your craft has a
function the chances are excellent you
can find a button on the X 55 to bind it
to which leads pretty well into my
general impressions of using
fifty-five as expected without the stick
or throttle bolted or stuck to anything
they slip all over the place but once
they're secured boy is it a lot of fun
to fly with this thing
it makes my a v8 er look like a toy and
once I'd quickly studied the default
mappings for elite dangerous had me
pulling maneuvers I simply couldn't on
my top gun which I've actually since
obtained a USB adapter for thanks to the
nearly unlimited number of inputs that I
could bind to individual thrusters
energy rerouting weapon system etc etc
etc I never once felt like accuracy was
an issue during my use of the product so
I guess their 16-bit hoop-dee-doo
granularity on the X and y-axis is
paying off and the backlighting
particularly on the throttle where it's
a bit more prominent is a godsend when
you're fumbling for a switch in the dark
so I guess its conclusion time from my
griping the X 55 is a really great
choice for folks who are after bang for
the buck
most of what I didn't like was a minor
annoyance and I feel like all of the
deficiencies I mentioned can be overcome
one way or another the included bolt
through holes on each unit allow it to
be installed on a weighted base if you
don't want to permanently mount it
somewhere the fact that I couldn't
conveniently reach a lot of the buttons
was overcome by the sheer number of them
and thankfully if you're like me and
you'll love one of the pieces but not
the other they each use a separate USB
cable so you can mix and match with
something else if you really want which
leaves the one real criticism for $200 I
think the plastics in the stick
especially should be heavier and more
solid feeling or State X should at least
take advantage of the fact that it's
removable and offer some alternative
sticks for folks who have smaller hands
because I found this one a little on the
uncomfortable side or for folks who want
something that feels more premium but
it's still a darn good value if you get
a good one because many online accounts
while my unit had no issues do point to
the QC on it not being exactly perfect
speaking of perfect this is a perfect
segue to audible.com which of course it
isn't but don't worry about it it
wouldn't be the first time I'd screwed
up a Segway they've got over a hundred
and fifty thousand audiobooks and
with their audible membership you get
one audiobook per month with discounts
on additional ones as well as a slew of
other benefits but why would you want an
audiobook you might ask well because
maybe you want to oh I don't know read
but you don't have the time to actually
set aside to stare at a book like if
you're in the car or you are a forklift
driver or you you know really really hey
you know dinner with your family and
they don't notice that you have like
your headphones on or but anyway the
point is they've got all kinds of
different audiobooks even stuff that you
can listen to with the kids like Winnie
the Pooh by a a Milne I had no idea they
had that on there the membership is
affordable and if you sign up now at
audible.com slash Linus which is linked
in the video description the first
audiobook is a hundred percent free cool
beans there are no beans just audiobooks
