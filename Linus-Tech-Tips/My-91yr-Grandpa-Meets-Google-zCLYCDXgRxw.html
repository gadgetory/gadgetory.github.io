the Google store that is to say the
online Google store where you buy like
hardware not the Google Play Store where
you buy music movies games etc contacted
me about sending me a care package to do
like a tech for dads type of feature but
then I'm thinking to myself Nexus 6p
Huawei watch onhub router Google
cardboard the new chromecast I'm kind of
like well I already have all that stuff
or something very similar so I thought
to myself who's a super cool dad I know
who not only isn't likely to have all
that stuff but has probably never even
heard of Google and the answer is my
grandpa John who is 91 years young
do you know what Google is Google
okay so last time I tried to get you on
the Internet that was about ten years
ago that didn't go so well did it
you tried very well thank you and you
did you did what you have to do you
finished it off all right
yeah I think you guys cancelled the
service within about three months
everything we're gonna do today doesn't
need the keyboard and doesn't need a
mouse you can do everything just by
touching that's pretty good
cuz yeah I think so nuts I'd say that
that's a real adventure something you
put in your pocket so tell me how you
watch TV just ordinary like we are right
now mm-hmm
I'm gonna show you how we can use this
device and the Internet to actually send
a video over to the TV so you slide your
finger that way so then I want you to
click on YouTube and you wanna do the
red one with the triangle oh and then
let's say maybe we want to watch um you
know CBC News okay there we go
all right what oh oh how hard is that to
just automatically the Internet ma'am
now what we can do is we could watch it
on here but that's very small right yeah
okay that's not a lot of fun so just
touch on this touch on the picture and
then do you see that little see that
little square on the top there yeah okay
you want to touch that one and then you
cast to Grandpa cast down here where it
says grandpa cast yeah boom so that what
what we were watching huh wowie I wish I
was 25 I could learn sooner um when you
want to rent a movie um how do you go
about that
pick one note take it home and use it
take them back when you finish so I'd
like to do it more but ah a lot of
little things we have to do when you get
ninety one
it's kind of a hassle to go out to the
store pick it out bring it home yeah
they get back when you're done that's
right and there's the hassle the better
better of something like this would be a
Bilbo you know no I'm gonna show you
obviously yeah so all you got to do is
click on play movie I'll play movie
right there okay and here sure I'm
subbing 50% off wahwee okay so what you
do is you you scroll with your finger
yeah and or your thumb yeah that works
too yeah and you can see any movie you
want oh my gosh good force awakens and
then you can rent for five bucks from
five bucks yep
yeah so it's six bucks if you don't have
to go there no well you got it pick it
up of course you know you don't have to
pick it up yeah good just click it just
click it then you click watch watch eh
