comm slash Vengeance gaming to learn
more now we've all seen those cheap
Korean IPs greater than HD resolution
monitors on eBay ok so we're familiar
with those they're actually fairly
inexpensive all things considered you
know considering that you're getting an
IPS screen that runs at 2560 by 1440
they're usually 27-inch models but not
everyone is comfortable with buying from
these weird sort of direct from Korea
eBay sellers and not everyone is
comfortable knowing that they are
getting an on a grade panel or sometimes
that non A+ grade because there's a wide
variety of different grades of LCD
panels so not knowing what they're
getting and obviously not having any
recourse if there are dead pixels or
whatever else so that my friends is
where Nick seus comes in they have got
their own version of what would be these
27-inch not quite a plus grade panels
but the key difference is that you have
a North American company to go to
assuming you live in North America so
you have a North American company to go
to if there's some kind of a problem and
you have someone actually doing like
some rudimentary quality control on them
as opposed to just going with sort of
off the the not quite correct
manufacturing line and just shipping
them out to you so that's Nick's es is
value-add here is their cue seeing it
they're giving you a support contact
that you can actually talk to here in
North America and they are delivering
you an IPS screen that is capable of
2560 by 1440 resolution also known as
what was the 2.5 K and they have also
made some modifications to the monitor
that make it a little bit better than
the cheapo ones as well so check this
out
number one is you have multiple display
imports so HDMI DVI VGA and DisplayPort
although it should be noted that the
only two that are capable of
playing at full resolution are gonna be
DVI and DisplayPort that's dual link DVI
not single-link DVI single-link DVI has
only the resolution of HDMI which is not
quite enough they've included all the
accessories you need to get it mounted
up I think this is the first time I've
ever seen like a mounting arm that just
clips on to a standard vase amount on a
monitor like this so we're gonna have to
go ahead and sort of figure that out I
guess I should finish showing you what's
on the bottom so other than that there's
audio as well as DC power in and you've
got all your ventilation holes on the
bottom as well as on the top of the
monitor up here now the front of the
monitor this is a 27-inch screen so you
can expect a little bit of a wider bezel
but it's not super wide it is a glossy
monitor so it's glossy on the bezel as
well as on the screen itself and all of
your on-screen menus are controlled by
the buttons down here at the bottom so
I'm actually going to throw this
together off-camera we'll be back in a
moment all the mounting hardware is
helpfully labeled so we're gonna start
with the the screw for connecting
monitor and shaft as opposed to the
screw for connecting the base and the
shaft so we just position this guy right
here over the four holes and then I
guess I probably should have opened up
this little baggie there we go so those
are for visa compatible screws and just
go ahead and position those right there
you can see that the mid the the arm is
height adjust which is really nice to
see just because especially with these
larger size monitors its huh it's nice
to be able to to move them around to
suit sort of your your individual
viewing style because they're so heavy
and so so large compared to smaller
monitors now while this is an
led-backlit model it's still a little
bit on the thicker side and heavier side
again because of that size and yeah
because of that size now I have a lot of
people sort of you know wonders asked me
what are the advantages and
disadvantages of a lot larger resolution
versus lower resolution and so I would
say well there's a couple things so
advantage number one is having that
pixel density gives you more clarity to
the image
so it is gonna look nicer disadvantage
number one is expect to be upgrading
your graphics card a lot more often if
you are wanting to play at native
resolution which will obviously look a
lot better than if you play at sort of
not a native resolution where you'll
have that that interpolation that you
encounter with that you can see there's
a bit of a bit of play there so let's
see how sturdy it is once we've actually
got it fully attached here so there it
is eight screws to get it set up and you
can see I've positioned it on the
included styrene so that it there you go
isn't resting on the screen itself once
it's on your desk I guess that is not
too bad actually I'm probably not gonna
bother you so you've got swivel like
that a little bit of tilt not much tilt
a little bit oh okay it looks like it
clicks into place for some reason okay
it's just caught on the plastic a little
bit so there's the tilt go ahead and
show you guys what degree of there you
go see there's a little plastic piece
there that just catches like that not a
problem okay and then last but not least
you do have height adjust which goes all
the way down to here and all the way up
to here right included accessories so
they do have an audio cable USB
extension cable and finally a dual link
DVI cable nice black cable looks pretty
slick and there's obviously instructions
for all the stuff that we just did and I
think that pretty much wraps it up thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at Nick's es is 27-inch 2560
