powering our coverage this year at NAB
2016 check them both out at the link in
the video description so as many of you
know we recently switched to LED for the
majority of our b-roll on Linus tech
tips and we've also begun using hive
Lighting's wasp plasma light for
specific tasks around the office as
noted in this fast as possible here so I
was absolutely floored when I first
heard about their newly announced plasma
1,000 light let's check it out so plasma
lighting which to quickly recap is
handled by converting argon gas into a
plasma that gives you a high output low
powered rod lighting fixture
- taking their plasma technology to the
next level with the plasma 1000 this
light is five times brighter than their
previous high output unit the WASC to
put this in perspective hives wasps
which is the light we have used on the
wine show as well as recent workshop
videos is the equivalent to a 1500 watt
incandescent fixture the plasma 1000 is
the equivalent of a nearly 10,000 watt
incandescent fixtures here's an example
of us shining the plasma 1000 onto a
sign in the ceiling of the convention
center here's what the shot looked like
properly exposed and then when shining
the positive 1000 on it
the exposure on that spot that you see
becomes overexposed by a full two stops
of light giving this slights and serious
power even at a fairly far distances now
you may be wondering why anyone would
even need this kind of power to begin
with I see a few great uses for it the
first being the ability to light
something properly at crazy high
slow-motion frame rates indoors since
the typical output of most lights even
below half the power of the plasma 1000
will not cut it for frame rates above
240 FPS it could also be a great light
for still photography particularly at
high shutter speeds in studio situations
or outdoors since it packs enough power
and being a constant source it will show
you what your lighting looks like at all
times something that small speed lights
just cannot do okay so bring this all
back down to a more practical view of
this light it is a great leap forward in
plasma technology and the trend
lower power draw high output lights for
production use and beyond lights like
the plasma 1000 put us on the path of
accessibility to shooting situations
that used to be reserved for only the
highest tier of production so whether
you're a seasoned pro or someone just
starting out plasma is a technology to
keep your arm as it matures it continues
to become more accessible to content
creators everywhere
thanks again the Sennheiser for sending
us here to nab this year make sure to
check out all their new stuff at the
link in the video description also
thanks to Kingston for sending us here
this year check out their brand new
superfast micro SD card made for action
cameras like the GoPro also linked in
the video description so thank you guys
for watching let me know in the comments
down below what you think of hives new
plasma 1000 light is that the type of
light that you want to use one day and
for all of our NAB 2016 coverage don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
