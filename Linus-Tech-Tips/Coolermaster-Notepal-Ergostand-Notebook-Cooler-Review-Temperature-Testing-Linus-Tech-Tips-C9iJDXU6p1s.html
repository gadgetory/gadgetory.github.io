methodology for the coolermaster note
pal or ghost and I'm going to be running
River tuner as well as real temp in the
background and I'm gonna run 3dmark oh
six this is on a seventy nine hundred GT
mobile graphics card with a oh man I
don't even know what CPU this thing has
why don't we find that out real quick Oh
CPU oh it's a cold case a Core 2 T 7200
at two gigahertz so it's got actually
four gigs around but for some reason it
only detects me gigs and I don't really
care why okay so I'm gonna go ahead and
run 3dmark and then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go back and find out
what the maximum recorded temperatures
were by real temp as well as by River
tuner now I'm gonna do this at three
different settings I'm gonna do it with
the note pal fan at high and you can
adjust that down here right there
there's a little slider I don't know if
you can see that at all but I've
adjusted it all the way to the maximum
now and then you can also I'm also gonna
do it with it at its lowest and then I'm
gonna do it sitting on a table so here
goes I'm not actually gonna make you sit
through all of this don't worry I'm just
gonna kind of come back and show results
periodically okay I've got my first test
result here so running with the fan on
full blast our maximum CPU temperature
was between 54 and 58 degrees depending
which quarry you're looking at and the
maximum GPU temperature that I found was
about 55 and a half degrees so we'll
call that 50 so there we go 56 degrees
on the GPU so now the next one I'm gonna
do is to turn the fan all the way to the
minimum and then run the benchmark again
and see how it fare so this is after my
run through with the fan on low so you
can see that my maximum CPU temperature
was 55 or 59 degrees so quite a bit
warmer than last time
and then my maximum at GPU temperature
was up and around the same range so we
saw it creep as high as 57 points
something yeah almost 58 degrees on the
GPU so we're gonna try one more time
with the laptop just on the
and then we're gonna see how much better
it does without a or wall I rather how
much worse it does without a fan so we
ran it actually what I did ended up
doing was putting it on the box which
you can see would be pretty similar to
how a table would cover the bottom of
the laptop and checking the high and low
temperature so you can see the CPU
temperatures are just a touch higher at
59 and 55 and then the GPU temperatures
are actually very similar only about a
degree higher so it looks like this
notebook cooling pad is only really
useful when you're using it with the fan
turned up probably to like a medium to
high speed and then it actually makes a
substantial difference I'm actually
going to do one more test I'm gonna run
it just on the bare carpet because so
many people run their laptops on carpet
as well as on flat surfaces the way that
they're supposed to so we'll try one
more test and we're gonna see how it
fares when it has like an insulating
layer of carpet under it so with it
running on the carpet actually I left it
for a while but I can just make out that
little hump there we saw it go as high
as 69 plus degrees on the GPU
oh please focus come on camera you can
do it oh you missed it oh I left it for
so long anyway okay yeah 69 there are 69
degrees and then on the CPU we saw it go
as high as 62 and 67 degrees so clearly
carpet is the worst out of everything we
tested and the notebook cooling pad the
note pallor ghost and is the best on its
high speed thank you for checking out my
unboxing well know this wasn't an
unboxing this was more of a performance
test look at that I actually did a
review of something for a change thank
you and I hope you enjoyed it and don't
