board from biostar okay so Biostar
boards are they're never the the most
premium motherboard on the market but
what they do represent is an incredibly
good value as stable overall board and
really an incredibly good value because
you get features on a Biostar board
within the same price point that you
just wouldn't see from pretty much any
other brand so this particular board is
the p55 board it's their t5 x ii
motherboard it does support crossfire
just like most pieces that most of the
other boards in this price point only
have one PCIe slot so they obviously
can't support crossfire so let's have a
quick look here at what the overall
features are the biotechs so it's got
green power efficiency 100% extreme
durable capacitors a unique PWM design
so it's called tweak tech-easy BIOS
update by USB flashdisk
that's a huge one this is so convenient
it makes a huge difference
overclocking navigator engine rapid
switch to shutdown and restart the
system you just have so I'm guessing
that's on board switches I guess we'll
we'll find out you know what why don't
we just open this thing up you only wait
no this is pretty good okay BIOS real
life resume crushed BIOS by USB
flashdisk
that is terrific okay so let's get this
opened up it supports core i7 as well as
Core i5 and core i3 processors like all
p55 board so let's see what we've got
for accessories first of all they've
included two SATA cables one molex to
SATA power adapter and then one IDE
cable and they've included it with this
nifty little blue velcro biostar cable
time that's kind of nice so now you can
go ahead and take that off your cables
and then use that to help manage the
cables inside your case that's terrific
okay that's well thought out okay then
we've got an i/o sheet io plate so you
can see that you've actually got to pop
these out yourself which is I haven't
seen that one in a little while okay so
then you've got a user's manual which is
wow that's some pretty good languages we
got there camera ads iPhones going off I
think he's gonna try an escape
find out what it is wow this has like
Arabic languages no I even got it right
this is Arabic they have like everything
in here polish that's awesome Portuguese
Spanish French German oh and then like
it's like 90% English okay
that works for me let's have a look at
the board itself so let's get this out
here one little piece of tape holding it
on all right so the actual board itself
you can see that even though the Box
might not be the nicest they haven't
skimped on the overall quality and look
at the board so you've got large heat
sinks and the places where they belong
so on the voltage regulators which looks
like a four phase setup okay and then
they've also got a nice decent looking
heatsink on the chipset itself I mean
this is if the p55 chipset it doesn't
use up a whole lot of power so you don't
need to worry too much about that so
let's start with the CPU socket like all
p55 boards it's I got an LT a 1156
socket so that has support for core i7
core i5 and core i3 but you should note
that for Core i5 and core i3 processors
you won't have support for their onboard
graphics with a p55 board
now like all p55 boards we've got
support for dual channel ddr3 for slots
and then you've got your power
connectors in there ideal locations with
the 24 pin on the right-hand edge and
the 4 pin up at the top left now this is
something that I'm really happy to see
on a value board because that's a lot of
the time the little inconveniences that
you start to run into on value boards is
they won't have the power connectors in
the right places or they they won't have
things well thought out in terms of the
ports now let's keep moving down the
board here so we've got one IDE port
here and then we've got a legacy floppy
port way down here alright so in terms
of SATA 2 we have 6 SATA 2 and these are
running off of the chipset now actually
there you go I've just said sometimes
the port layouts are not ideal on a
value board and that's what we're seeing
here because if you actually install 2
dual slot graphics cards in this
motherboard you will block the top 3
SATA ports unless you're using right
angle connectors on them so then you've
got your color-coded front panel
connectors a power switch and a reset
onboard switch I really like
see that again on a value board like
this - front USB headers and then
expansion slots why don't I just hold
the camera so the cameraman can go in
its first phone just get better okay he
just turned it off
okay so then we've got a PCI Express 16
X 2 PCI Express 1 X another PCI Express
16 X like all p55 board sees will run at
8 X 8 X and crossfire then we have 2 PCI
slots and let's just move around to the
back and see what we've got for i/o so
it includes 2 ps2 ports one for the
mouse and one for the keyboard 6 USB 2.0
ports 1 Gigabit LAN and 7.1 audio so no
frills no gimmicks just a unit like many
bio start will actually have to say
almost all bio start e-series boards in
the past have been great performers for
the dollar they don't have the gimmicky
features but what they do have is good
value the features you really need to
get the performance out of your system
and I just thought now we take a quick
look at this thing and on the back
there's back pleat thanks for checking
it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
