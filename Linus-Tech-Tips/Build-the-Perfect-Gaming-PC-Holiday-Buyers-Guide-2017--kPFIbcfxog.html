buyers guides and oh my god hi every
July that's okay
that's not the point the point today is
whether you're buying a new gaming PC
for yourself or for somebody on your
nice list
we've got suggested parts at three key
price points under five hundred bucks
around a thousand dollars and
approximately two thousand dollars so
let's get to it so tax ZBOX pcs are
great for applications like productivity
streaming and gaming they feature
seventh gen Intel Core processors and
they're super small check them out at
the link below so let's just dig right
in with our budget-friendly
just game build where if it doesn't
improve your frames per second it
doesn't make the cut when we first saw
current pricing we actually thought we
were gonna be stuck with an athlon x4
950 but using a six-year-old CPU
architecture today felt wrong so we
crunched some numbers and miraculously
managed to squeeze in a risin 312
hundred with its stock cooler this did
necessitate dropping down to an asrock
a320 MD g5 socket a.m. for motherboard
which doesn't support overclocking but
this is still a major performance
improvement over any of the Athlone
options on the subject of performance
improvements we've got the same amount
of RAM as last year and for that matter
the same amount of RAM as our 2013
holiday buyer's guide due to the
worldwide shortage of DRAM that's
driving up pricing so eight gigs of
whatever ddr4 2400 or higher from a
reputable vendor is what you're gonna
get and while upgradability isn't a
major consideration for this build that
rear i/o on the motherboard is a prime
example we're going to use one stick
instead
to to give us most of our performance
today with the ability to throw another
one in down the line for dual-channel
for storage we've taken a page out of
our 2015 guide and done with a one
terabyte Seagate fire cuda hybrid drive
for a balance of capacity price and
performance and for our case we've gone
with a thermal take v2 plus which for
the money gives us both a solid enough
chassis and a power supply that while
super cheap and only capable of about
300 watts continuous probably won't
instantly vaporize thanks to its
two-year warranty though you will
absolutely want to replace it if you
upgrade your CPU or your graphics card
later on speaking of the graphics card
this year we're going with the msi
geforce gtx 1050 ti4 gig truthfully it's
a step down from what we'd like to use
if we had a bit more to spend but a
budget sub budget so overall then this
year we've got a much faster CPU for
overall system performance and less
framerate variance in gaming but we're
actually taking a significant hit on our
DP u performance thanks to the renewed
cryptocurrency mining craze that's
driving up pricing and we couldn't
really fit in an SSD as a result of the
worldwide NAND flash shortage which
sucks but we did end up with a pretty
well-balanced machine here that can
handle eSports titles and console
quality 1080p gaming our mid-range game
now build creeps a little higher budget
wise but picks up some significant
upgrades including arisin v 1400 again
paired with its stock Wraith stealth
cooler not to be dissuaded by the
hilariously cheesy stock photo and MSI's
website we then paired it with an msi be
350 PC mate motherboard it's technically
branded as a business board see look
he's wearing a suit but the quad Ram
slots and VR on heatsinks for better
upgrade ability and cooling should give
us solid real-world benefits for gaming
as well for RAM we've got 16 gigs of
dual-channel ddr2 400 megahertz Ram
making this build more of a platform
upgrade than a performance upgrade
compared to last year's though it should
be noted that these sticks run at just
one point two volts meaning that like
the CPU itself you could overclock them
a little if you choose giving you a bit
of a bump over last year's model for
storage we contemplated going with a
four terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive rather
than take a 30 percent capacity hit due
to SSD prices but ended up opting for a
525 gig crucial MX 300 for better
overall system performance so hopefully
if you're spending $1,000 on a system
you can man wait a month or two to save
up for a hard drive where you've got an
old one lying around that you can use
for bulk storage our case this year is a
thermal take versa h21
which like last year's versa age 25
offers tooless access and installation
top ventilation holes and unofficial
radiator support if you've got a dremel
and a couple of hours on your hands for
power we chose a fully modular EVGA 550
watt b3 which should be plenty for
everything we've listed so far and the
gtx 1070 that we managed to stuff into
this about $1000 budget now the 1070
isn't a step forward from last year but
it's not a step backwards either with
its excellent 1080p or even 1440p
performance once Vega 56 availability
improves a little bit that would also be
a viable option at this price point for
team red members so then compared to
last year we spent a few bucks more but
we get into a fresh platform that
promises solid upgrade ability down the
road now you could choose instead a core
i5 7500 with a be 250 board which might
even give you better overall performance
but you'd be even further over budget
and it is less likely that you'd be able
to slot in a new CPU for a performance
increase a year or two from now let's
get then to our high-end game on build
this sucker clocks in at roughly $2,000
and is designed with gaming performance
in mind but also as a capable
workstation so it sports a core i7 7800
x6 core CPU running on an Asus tough X
299 mark 2 motherboard this means that
unlike last year's core i7 6800 K build
we get to take advantage of both the
updated cache setup and avx-512 support
that was introduced with skylake x4 a
nice little productivity boost and the
higher clock speeds are just gravy we've
given it a 32 gig quad channel kit of
g.skill ddr4 3200 memory for optimal
performance and as for cooling we really
like the Noctua Nhu 14s it's a quiet
solution that will allow some light
overclocking while being easier on the
wallet than a high performance a i/o
liquid cooler storage brings us to this
year's first dual drive setup a 525 gig
crucial MX 300 m dot 2 paired with a
Seagate Barracuda 4 terabyte for bulk
storage and then all of this bolts into
the corsair carbide clear 400 C a
cleanly laid out case with an acrylic
windowed side panel that can optionally
handle liquid cooling later on now
although we were disappointed by its
pricing compared to last year the GTX
1080 still ends up being the obvious
choice at this price point and it will
comfortably handle high refresh rate
1080p or 60fps 1440p gaming and we will
power this beast with AC Sonic 80 plus
gold 750 watt semi modular power supply
easily more than enough for our needs
though at $2,000 should be about more
than just needs and overall this build
was a bit of a disappointment for us we
get a generational CPU performance boost
over last year sure but we're not
getting nearly the capacity of SSD that
we did then and frankly we were really
hoping that by this time there would be
a bonafide competitor to the GTX 1080
driving down not just its pricing but
also the flagship 1080 Ti I mean as it
is you could squeeze in videos
top-of-the-line into a high quality
build for $2000 but you would need to
make a few compromises and either wait
for better coffee like available
or settled for a quad-core so maybe next
year we'll get a $2,000 system that's
worth upgrading to from our 2016 model
like can we AMD and NVIDIA if we're
really good I guess we'll see anyway
guys full disclosure time we do not get
any kickbacks from manufacturers for our
holiday buyers guides part selections
but we do receive a commission if you
buy your stuff using the links below so
if you're shopping go check them out
even if you aren't buying exactly the
same thing but if you're just using our
lists as a starting point and however
many systems you're buying whether it's
one or or three or you're getting a
MacBook and like a Linux workstation and
a PC synergy would be a great thing to
add synergy is a software download that
solves the problem of having two
keyboards and two mice once and for all
you can share a single setup for
referrals between two or more computers
even cross-platform windows linux and
mac so you'll no longer get confused you
just move the mouse across seamlessly
you start typing boom it works and
features include things like clipboard
sharing dragging and dropping files
between the computers the ability to set
up hotkeys and more so try it out with
our link in the video description to get
your 50% off synergy today so thanks for
watching guys at this video sucked you
know what to do but it was awesome get
subscribed hit that like button or check
out the link to where to buy the stuff
we featured in the video description I
guess I already said that also linked in
the descriptions are merch storage has
closed shorts like this one in our
community forum which you should totally
