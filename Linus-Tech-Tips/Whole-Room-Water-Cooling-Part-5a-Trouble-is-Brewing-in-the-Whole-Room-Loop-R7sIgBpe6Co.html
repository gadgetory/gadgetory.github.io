the second we tried to shoot day five we
hit a snag the problem is that once
again we think the issue is our Wireless
kit and it's not we killed yet another
lab presumably from having them clipped
to my waist and then having tension on
them here because the issue is that
we've actually killed one of these
before to one of these Sennheiser ones
and then we just killed our countryman
the issue is that the cables reinforced
here and then they just break here so it
feels like the higher you go and
reinforced it is going to break it there
so I don't know what the solution is
it's ridiculous I just just add tape to
the entirety of the table that it's just
one solid line I don't no idea what this
is mate no it's not from me
apparently mate bought me another D on
another blu-ray though oh this is a
notebook 15 inch gaming over and it's
not broken this is a whole room water
cooling project through my tech tips is
crazy
how long has it been since we've
actually worked on this mess four months
something like that so while we are
finally back at it and finishing the
whole room water cooling loop is going
to have some challenges that we didn't
have the first time around because now
we have to figure out how to finish
people systems like I don't even have
the III don't even have the like the the
tubing finished for some people systems
without interrupting them working or at
least pretending to be working they're
actually eating we are at putting the
other ends of the quick disconnects onto
the computers because in order to work
on the loop we need to have people's
systems running disconnected I would
never recommend filling the water
cooling loop of a system that's running
while it's running
I believe my red is already full
and let's find out if my hot swap system
works or not I would recommend saving
your work oh well this is smarter than
what I was doing I just filled the rad
with the whole room system uh-huh right
that's way better because now okay well
right now your system is in trouble but
so now we don't have to worry about
bleeding oops
okay well we'll go around and we'll do
the CPU swaps later I guess
are we sure to CPU Terran can I find out
what CPU you have okay
okay I'm gonna try and do this right
this time how are your temps doing
because your water is not moving right
now ah it does seem to be going up okay
too quickly and you are swapped off
how's it look now it's going up going up
yeah holy crap okay just like to say
everything's okay
oh wait it's not like Slocum I know
you're not up to anything right now we
need coolant flow are we going down yeah
Wow
90 degrees yep good um so your pump is
it on your pump doesn't seem to be doing
anything all right then so the good the
positive takeaway here is that the whole
room pump is working
I thought so but we're gonna
double-check the pump is connected to
the hump bone pump bones think it to the
cakes bone taste bones connected to
nothing so we gotta plug in your pump
you know let me probably own it at
during the parts of my slop yeah and
everybody probably didn't need swagger
back or felt like we didn't need to plug
it back in now in Fisher we just got
well I like to give people the benefit
of the doubt especially when they're me
okay all yours already has fittings on
it yeah I put them on there oh yeah no
you didn't good color too big is that
supposed to be this clear there's
definitely a lot of bubbles in the loop
at the moment if it's just that tubing
getting all grossed out or if it's the
blocks
yeah the blocks seem fine it's just ugly
ugly good like it's you can actually see
it just needs to keep in mind there are
things on top of this space though there
probably ain't anymore do you can you
see that okay no that's probably there's
some air in your block now because we're
messing around with you well it's
probably okay put all my screens with
blue hey why do I ever listen to you one
day I'm gonna tell you something
and you're gonna be the cooler and
you're gonna die you're gonna lose like
your left pinky or something well we
just feel out baking okay for the first
time since we set it up the whole room
water cooling system is off I mean
completely off the fans of innocence
about the first week so after all that
work to have all the systems hooked up
to a whole room water cooling system we
have successfully disconnected them all
yay but but there's a purpose there's a
purpose because this is our new pump
which we will actually be installing in
addition to our existing pump now I
ordered our two MD QSC I ordered a
matching one for our other one they
actually sent me a three m DQ SC so this
one's slightly more powerful something I
didn't really want um so I don't know
III think that's not really recommended
for serial pump operation but we don't
really have much of a choice at this
point so this one has slightly higher
head pressure as well as slightly higher
flow rate than the other one so off we
go so one issue that we've had is that
one of the fittings on this pump has
actually been leaking see right here
there's a yeah there's definitely a leap
there so we've actually had some
corrosion of the base and it's been kind
of nasty this is our anti vibration pad
that makes it slightly less loud alright
so that means we have to figure out how
to close off these now I have one idea
for once I'd like is this going to work
what if I just mush it
like the thing is stuck to the other one
thought I was an idiot I mean I might
still be an idiot what I'm about to do
with it is idiotic so I'm trying to mush
the mush the tubing --here water will
rush from this opening on both on both
ends and I don't know how much I'll be
able to do to stop it here wait no it
should be fine
because in theory I blocked them right
so what I need to do is plan to do this
one first because I suspect this one is
less likely to leak as much so I want to
pull this off how much pressures in
there
I don't know it's a mystery it worked
Wow okay let's find out let's find out
if this is going to hold only one way to
know for sure
hippity Boop done it looks like there's
a little bit of corrosion on this
fitting right here but it might not be a
big deal there is definitely some crap
in here that is that is an extremely
that is an extremely bad thing so that's
what's staining the inside of the tubing
I think it's coming from here
which could be a very very bad thing
steel reservoir should be fine if you
have if you're running basically we're
just running automotive antifreeze in
here but it looks like something about
it is not working like it's not
obviously just full of sediment I wonder
if all that gunk settled reasonably well
because we didn't notice any buildup on
the blocks either which is good because
it means it won't affect cooling
performance but I'd still like to have
things cleaner than that if it can be so
here are the floaties I'm talking about
and how they're kind of mushy which
leads me to believe that there's some
kind of life-form as opposed to just
being um like rust buildup also kind of
greasy but then that could just be the
see that everyone see geez yeah not what
we were trying to do here what this
means now is that we either have to
accept that there's stuff growing in our
loop and write off all the gear that's
attached to it as contaminated until
it's cleaned or we have to take
everything apart replace all the tubing
clean all the blocks and replace this
reservoir in order to start fresh so
given that we're moving in two months we
are going to go for the temporary
solution which is flush the res flush
the loop go much much heavier on the on
the antifreeze this time and and and
kind of live with it for another couple
months before we move experience silent
performance with the new cooler master
Silencio 652 s minimalist design maximum
compatibility click now to learn more of
our host still works
kind of fell okay well the stuff that's
on the lip here see that's funny it
seems kind of greasy you know I wonder
if it I wonder maybe I'm wrong maybe
it's not maybe it's not living maybe
it's just something left over in here
from manufacturing we didn't have a lot
of options in terms of reservoirs but I
can see we made the wrong choice
Oh grody that doesn't look like a
coating and it's like it's all over the
the upper walls as well and I remember
looking into it like there was nothing
on there before but I'm not sure what we
managed to introduce to the system that
grows in an anti-freeze water mixture
maybe some of the viewers will have some
insight they all appear to be experts on
this kind of project anyway like coming
into today I was thinking we might need
some kind of a filter inline or
something something like that but this
is clearly just beyond filtration
putting this back in the loop doesn't
seem to be an option so what I think
we're going to do as stupid as this is
is we're going to leave the loop open
for now with like buckets yep we're
going bucket water cooling because I
don't want to especially now that I've
disturbed whatever's in here we're going
to get chunks going through the loop and
if one of those chunks ends up in a
water block the cooling performance of
that system is food I don't think that's
happened yet I don't have a reason to
believe that's happened yet looking at
the temperatures at people's systems so
we can't we can't risk that happening so
then what we'll need to do is we'll need
to get a replacement reservoir for when
we move and when we move we will have to
we'll have to do something we'll have to
clean out the system we'll have to clean
out the tubing and blocks and start
fresh the radiators are going to be a
real problem it may need to just replace
them
so while edy took a break to copy
footage I figured I'd get our pumps
prepped it turns out the reason it was
leaking was way back when I when I
initially used this pump I apparently
didn't know what teflon tape was because
I apparently didn't use it so that would
be why that fitting was leaking I also
spent a little bit of time googling and
while and while automotive antifreeze
does indeed contain an anti corrosive
which is good that's what I was really
concerned about what it does not contain
and I had I guess assumed it contains is
a biocidal agent so that is why our loop
is full of what is now definitely
organic matter
we have no flux I I have no solder I do
have to go though you probably have a
sand bag on your lattic website okay but
the sound beans it's not working let's
try to beat that in</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
