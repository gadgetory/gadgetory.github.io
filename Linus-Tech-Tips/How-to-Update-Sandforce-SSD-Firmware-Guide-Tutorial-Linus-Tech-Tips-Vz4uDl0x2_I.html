Prairie Sun force 2281 drives that are
going to need their firmware updated
I've got a Chronos deluxe from lush skin
I've also got a couple of wildfires the
other wildfire is plugged into a SATA
cable hanging off the back of this
machine and so basically I want to
switch from having two test benches to
three test benches so I'll have instead
of an AMD and Intel I want to have a
2011 and 1155 and an am3+ so that I can
easily and quickly compare anything on
any of the major platforms without
swapping CPU coolers etc etc etc so on
now they finally fix the stability
issues that people were having with some
blue screens and whatnot with the Sam
for state of three drives I'm going to
go ahead and update these three drives
and then I'm going to well get my test
benches set up so I figured I might as
well do a video about how to update the
firmware on your SSD so in this case I
downloaded the Patriot SSD updater so I
obviously got that one off the Patriot
website you want to run it as an
administrator if you're using Windows 7
or Windows Vista it scans for drives you
go ahead you select your drive you
update the firmware this all comes in in
a single pack so it comes with the
firmware as well as the release notes
and the updater so you just click open
automatic restart may occur after this
operation etc etc etc so there's a few
other things that you have to factor in
I tried this on an AMD chipset this is a
modern AMD chips at 990 FX board and
this error doubt after about half a
second so what I had to do was I tried
switching to HCI mode that didn't help
so I moved it over to an Intel board
this is a p55 board and now it's working
with no issues so only certain chipsets
are going to be able to update the
firmware correctly you do want to be in
HCI mode so that is a factor as well and
other than that I can't really think of
anything No look at that it's complete
already hey here's something interesting
why don't we find out together if I can
update a muskan Kronos using the patriot
utility and the patriot firmware because
they are using the same flash these are
all
hoggle chip drives with 2281 controller
so as far as the actual hardware is
concerned they are basically identical
so let's see if the mush can drive will
allow me to update it
I might have to grab the rescan four
drives I might have to grab the updater
from the muskan site instead scanning
for drives please wait
oh look at this okay
update firmware okay okay huh that oh no
it didn't work
yeah okay yeah so it's saying you know
basically no you don't allowed to do
that
okay well either way my Patriot ones are
updated and I will update the muskan one
after and I think I've covered pretty
much everything I wanted to say so thank
you for checking out my little video on
how to update the firmware of your SATA
