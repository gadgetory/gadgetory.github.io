LG Graham 14-inch which has been in my
backpack since I reviewed it back in
March and now there is finally something
that might be able to knock it off its
pedestal the LG Graham 13 inch and 15
inch they're still super lightweight but
they now pack double the CPU core count
for better performance and speaking of
better today's video is brought to you
by be quiet the dark bass 700 is a way
to make your system will look better
it's a versatile case with RGB LED
lighting plus a tempered glass side
panel window and more check it out at
the link below
opening up the 15-inch LG gran late 2017
it looks almost identical to the older
revision and only a highly trained eye
would be likely to spot any differences
without resorting to opening up cpu-z to
check the cpu model as for the 14-inch
model well that's easier because it just
doesn't exist anymore to replace it the
13-inch model has gained a bit of heft
making it the same weight as the
outgoing 14 but you get some extra
benefits for the small amount of
additional arm strain including 40% more
cooling and a much stiffer chassis I was
initially a little upset but I ended up
not minding this move much practically
speaking the inch didn't make much
difference for me so what we're gonna do
is focus on the 13-inch
for the rest of this video io on both of
the new models is identical and
unchanged from last generation HDMI to
USB 3 Taipei's and a Type C is
reasonable enough for a modern ultra
portable but the inclusion of
Thunderbolt 3 would have made it nearly
perfect for use with an external GPU box
as expected from LG the IPS display
looks great with accurate colors and
very deep blacks
although the webcam is still pretty
mediocre especially in this professional
slash business class of products and the
placement straight-up sucks as for the
screen hinge it's still wobbly er than
I'd like for a touchscreen but it lifts
with one finger and is definitely solid
enough for non touch use the slight
increase in weight hasn't taken away
from the startling lightness of the
Graham and I really think once again
that the trade off adding a bit more
weight generation by generation but
adding features was justified in day to
day use the stiffer chassis really
changes the experience
let's take typing for example I already
liked the last generations keyboard so
for me this is just more of a good thing
but even though as far as I can tell
nothing
the switches themselves actually changed
this crisper feel for people like Alex
and James was the difference between
liking it and not liking it at all and
this carries through to the trackpad as
well it's still not amazing and this
fingerprint reader in the top left
that's a rotten position makes it feel
even smaller but it's definitely better
back to that fingerprint scanner
fingerprint recognition
unless it's integrated somewhere
sensible like the power button is pretty
trash in my opinion Windows hello facial
recognition would be a welcome addition
to a future LG ground now the other big
change with this iteration is the
addition of 40% more cooling capacity
for that new core i7 8550 you quad-core
hyper threaded processor it finally
happened dual cores dead and long live
quad-core now this is not even the most
powerful
ultrabook we've seen yet and via me
storage was left out as a cost-saving
measure and the gram tops out in the mid
70s with all cores running at a very
unimpressive 1.8 gigahertz but this
should still amount to a massive
increase in real-world performance and
right out of the gate in Cinebench
multi-threaded the new gram is 56
percent faster than the old one meaning
that if even occasionally you find
yourself dealing with a heavier workload
this will make a huge difference
putting tasks like photo editing or even
light video editing on the table for the
gram but with great power comes great
power consumption if all you want to do
is browse the internet and edit Word
documents things that the old Graham
with its dual core handled just fine is
it possible that this battery life
trade-off isn't worth it
well that one's gonna be up to you the
new Graham scored only seven hours and
20 minutes in our work battery life test
to be clear this is still leagues ahead
of most other laptops but at about two
hours less than the seventh gen model
it's less Wow amazing and more pretty
darn good
what isn't taken into account here
though is that during those seven hours
and 20 minutes the new Graham was
getting a lot more work done so this is
cool if you take the same non intensive
tasks like watching a video or editing a
Word document the new Graham
actually outperforms the old version
fortunately one thing that wasn't
touched was the upgrade ability I mean
there isn't a whole lot that you can do
in here but it is nice that on the
15-inch the m2 SSD and Ram can be
upgraded down the road or with that
empty slot in our 13-inch we can just
upgrade it right now YUM 16 gigs all
right then the LG Graham has always been
astonishingly light and it remains that
way still but with the dramatically
increased performance and on the 13-inch
model the improved build quality it's
gone from a notebook that made some
serious compromises in the name of
lightness to a serious notebook that is
still lighter than anything else in its
size class and it does this without
being unreasonably priced highly
recommended as for the 15-inch model
it's also more powerful but it's very
clear where LG's engineers invested
their effort this time around we all
prefer the 13 on the subject of
preferring things you might find that if
you try it out you prefer ting ting is
the mobile carrier that's focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction first when you call them
you don't speak to a robot you get put
through directly to a person and you
don't even pay extra for the privilege
the average ting bill is just 23 bucks a
month per device and you only pay for
exactly the airtime and data that you
use if you're stuck in a contract and
switch to ting they'll cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to
five bucks and they've got lowered
mobile data rates data is just ten
dollars a gig beyond the first gig
pretty cool so head over to lightest
ENCOM kyun how much you're paying right
now and how much you use and try out
their savings calculator and it'll spit
out how much you'd save on ting when you
sign up at our link you'll also get 25
bucks in service credit or towards a new
device so thanks for watching guys if
this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit

to where to buy the stuff we featured
especially the 13 inch I in the video
