relic now while this product is not that
old it is still a bit of a rarity
because not very many people bought them
this is the OCC and yo this is a USB 3
portable solid-state drive this was
first shown at CES 2010 and check this
out check this out this is how long this
unit has been sitting in our warehouse
to the dust on my finger yeah disgusting
ok so this is the 128 gig version and
what ocz was attempting to accomplish
with this particular product was a way
for users to have a portable USB flash
drive that is as durable as a USB flash
drive but offers a much larger amount of
storage so when this Drive was released
the biggest USB drives were in the 32
gig range so while the size of this
device is larger than a USB drive the
speed is vastly superior ok it offers
read and write speeds up to I guess
hopefully it'll tell us at some point
because I don't actually know but
dramatically superior speeds and larger
capacity but the drawback is that it is
also significantly larger than a USB
flash drive so here I'm going to show
you guys the Nu here it is so this uses
a 1.8 inch SATA to drive this is an in
the links drive inside a very slick
aluminum enclosure so this is a very
classy looking product it's got a custom
interface on the back so that is a USB 3
interface that is somehow I guess
adapted for SATA power and data let's
not let's have a look at the cable
that's included you see just what kind
of fancy shmancy cable we're dealing
with here because I've never seen this
cable before here we go ok ok ok know
the reason I'm not familiar with this is
just because I haven't used much usb3
stuff this is just a USB 3 mini B cable
so micro USB 3 is what they're calling
this and that is be so that SuperSpeed
USB 3 so remember USB 3 is up to 10
times the speed of us be too alright it
comes with a nice high quality very
flexible cable here usb3 connector on
the one end and then we've got the micro
connector on the other end and then
actually hold on give me two seconds so
I just had to create a partition on the
drive so I'm going to go ahead and take
my benchmarking and drivers folders
which total about five gigs I'm going to
copy them over to local disk why I'm so
fast ok that was just the burst at the
beginning so the actual sustain transfer
speeds that we can get out of this are
around 130 2 108 spur second very very
respectable so we're pretty much up
there at the limits for USB 3 that's
about oh yeah can remember zoomed in too
far that's why it was blurry um yeah so
that's pretty much all i have to say
about that very fast um not a lot of
people bought them but yeah it was
pretty expensive at the time I think the
128 gig drive upon release was in the
400 to 500 dollar range so thank you for
