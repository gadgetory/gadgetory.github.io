Coolermaster featuring the site and 240
millimeter all-in-one cpu water cooling
system check it out at WWE master
usa.com
this unboxing is actually meant to be an
unboxing of a couple of different things
so number one is gonna be silver stones
strider gold evolution power supply the
golden standard for psu performance
efficiency and quality is what they had
to say for themselves about it
it delivers a thousand watt sustained
1,100 watts peak and is basically just
got all of the other good stuff about it
that silverstone usually has so there's
a quiet one hundred and thirty-five
millimeter cooling fan this is a Strider
series power supply so it is presumably
fully modular although I actually am not
a hundred percent sure and actually nah
I'm kidding yeah it's a hundred percent
modular okay there's some manuals inside
there's some stuff inside here don't
worry I'm getting to the second part of
the unboxing very quickly here so we've
got a power cable from do not eat
there's that do not eat throw away do
not eat thank you we've got closed cell
foam which is of course very good for
keeping your power supply safe look at
this that's a nice touch that's a new
thing so they've included a magnetic
dust filter so that's a 140 millimeter
dust filter you go ahead and pop that on
your power supply or if you don't want
to use it on your power supply you go
ahead put it somewhere else it's up to
you it's magnetic so it'll like stick to
things that aren't your face no it
doesn't stick to my face okay that's
okay power supply you've got some cable
management velcro zip ties as well as
some regular zip ties some look at that
two sets of mounting screws so they
include four thumb screws and then four
regular black screws for mounting the
power supply to your case and the power
supply itself which has actually just a
gorgeous finish on it so it's got kind
of uh it looks very similar to mountain
mods is black wrinkle finish and you can
tell right away with a paint finish is
it going to be durable is it not gonna
be durable this looks like one of the
nicer this might be the nicest finish on
a power supply I've ever seen check that
out that looks absolutely gorgeous
okay so FF 141 yeah magnetize fan filter
included 24-hour fully continuous power
output with a 40 degree centigrade
operating temperature so that is
extremely high if you're actually
operating your computer in a 40 degree
Celsius environment then I feel really
really bad for you in addition to your
computer so that means that in all
likelihood this power supply can do more
than a thousand watts sustained if
you're in a reasonable room which is
probably more like 20 degrees Celsius so
about half of that it uses a single 12
volt rail to achieve its thousand watt
output so that's 83 ms on that single 12
volt rail which means it can provide
almost its entire thousand watt output
on that single rail meaning it's
probably using a voltage converter as
opposed to having dedicated circuitry
inside so it's actually going okay we're
gonna take the AC voltage coming in at
the back we're gonna convert it all to
12-volt DC and then we're going to
convert that DC voltage to 5 volt and
3.3 volt which are the other rails on
the power supply this actually ends up
being more efficient than the more
traditional approach of having dedicated
circuitry for each one so it's a very
very good way to do it and it also means
that you're not going to be limited in
terms of how many graphics cards or how
many 12-volt heavy devices that you can
plug into it CPUs for example also use
12 volt okay so that's pretty much it
for that let's have a look at the cables
included and then we're gonna move on to
the most special part about this power
supply unboxing which is that you don't
have to use these cables so Silverstone
has gorgeous power supplies they look
fantastic but they're not always
necessarily the ones that I would want
to use for a showcase build because the
cables included while they have decent
sleeving on them I mean you actually
can't see the color the cables
underneath too much this is better than
most of the Silverstone power supplies
I've seen before often leave a little
bit to be desired because these
connectors you can see are using colored
cables and they're there's a little bit
of bare area and all that kind of stuff
so I'm gonna show you the alternative
cables that you can use that are the
best cables I have ever seen so first of
all harnesses so the first harness here
is quadruple bull I rather triple molex
with a floppy connector on the end of
each one and it's about a
hmm looks like about a Linus bellybutton
to tip of Linus arm in terms of length
all right the next one we have these are
quad SATA harnesses and they are using
sort of the the upside down
configuration so that means you have to
run it up to the top and then down to an
optical drive due to the orientation of
the connector itself this doesn't really
bother me because generally speaking if
I'm going down to hard drives I don't
mind kind of going like this because
they're not that far away and if I'm
going down to an optical drive I'm
usually cable managing up the back of
the case but not everyone prefers that
so I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys
make a decision similar length on that
guy 24-pin connector very short for the
24 pin connector which I do like to see
because you don't need a long 24 pin
connector you don't route them that far
in all modern cases pretty much have a
nice place to put them these PCI Express
cables have capacitors built into them
this can actually improve the
performance but it's not the kind of
thing again that I'd like to see on the
best cable managed system ever so
there's two six plus two connectors that
have individual connectors on the ends
and then there's two more that have a
six plus two and an additional six pin
and these are ideal for graphics cards
that have two connectors so you only
have to truly have to run one cable over
to the whole thing and then you can plug
in two connectors to the graphics card
itself so it's a total of four six plus
2s and two six pin connectors and
finally you've got two four plus four
connectors for high-end motherboards
that ask for two of them now I promised
to show you guys the best sleeved cables
that I have ever ever encountered ever
and if I could figure out where my knife
was then I would do that here we go so
we're gonna cut it open that felt
violent and there we have it so these
are not these are better than MD PCX
folks these are the best I've
encountered they actually are using more
of a cloth braiding on them as opposed
to AAS so they're individually sleeved
and they're using not plastic no plastic
and it's yeah just oh absolutely
beautiful I mean part of the point of
sleeving is for look part of the point
is for better air flow in the case
individually sleeving the cables kind of
kicks in the teeth but it's fashionable
right now so people do it but the last
point of sleeving cables is actually to
make them more durable so if you were to
accidentally slip with a screwdriver and
hit something or with a knife or
scissors or pretty much almost anything
else you'd actually have a really hard
time cutting these cables because they
have an extremely durable sleeving or if
you had like a cut out in those in a cpu
tray or something or a cpu hole or
something and it rubbed up against it
for a long time if it was a just not
covered in sleeving at all if you had
two cables that wore out they could
short on each other whereas this that
will not happen so I have a 24-pin I've
also got some other ones here so I've
actually got a wide variety of these
cables you can pick them up they're good
for any
okay for Silverstone power supplies only
refer to website for details is what
they have to say for themselves but
they're available in a wide variety of
different configurations and I think
that pretty much wraps it up so okay yes
the Strider 1,000 watt beautiful-looking
power supply kind of ugly cables but you
have the opportunity to put the nicest
cables available on it alright guys so
this is officially the most gorgeous
looking power supply that I think anyone
here in the studio has ever seen so
we've got a number of different kinds of
connectors here so this guy right here
is an individually sleeved 6+2
the great thing about these individually
sleeve cables is if you want to run just
a six you don't have to put the two
right next to it you can actually just
tuck them away somewhere here I mean you
can even cut them off if you really
wanted to but I'd feel like like I'm
destroying a work of art with this
particular power supply this one right
here is a six plus two plus a six so
that way you could run one gorgeous
sleeved cable to a video card that needs
two connectors I'm just gonna put this
down here so here's our 24 pin which
also oh wait no it isn't that's 2 4 +
fours there we go
so those are for your CPU connectors oh
looks so good so good like so Pro so
much better than even like pro sleeved
individually done power supplies because
if you even look at where they're
terminated there's no heat shrink on any
a few of the connector so this one's
special because there's two wires going
into into that one so you can see that
there's just there's nothing it's
completely clean it's very very rare
that you see someone put the time and
attention into plastics leaving to get
that right because you'll actually have
to pre-plan the way the cable is gonna
curve to have them all terminate like
that see something like molex it's a
little bit tougher to do that because of
the way that the pins are done but with
anything like here we go where are they
yeah there we go so there's the four
pins so the four plus fours
where are the SATA ones SATA ones look
very clean as well so there's no color
to them whatsoever cuz I think they're
using black wires inside but it's so
hard to tell because this sleeving is so
so opaque you just can't see through it
at all
so absolutely gorgeous I think these
wires are a little bit no they're about
the same length as the stock ones that
were included so I think that pretty
much wraps it up thank you for checking
