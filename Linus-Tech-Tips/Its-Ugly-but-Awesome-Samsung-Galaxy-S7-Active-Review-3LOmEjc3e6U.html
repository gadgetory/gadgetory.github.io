its strong battery life great camera and
rugged build quality and as my wife's
daily driver has actually continued to
impress me with better than expected
software updates provided you perform
them manually if you're not an AT&amp;amp;T user
its successor the s7 active blew me away
with its brick-like size and weight and
unbelievably ugly gold front bezel but
then again maybe there is more to this
ugly duckling than meets the eye
that's all hope so

universal compatibility on its void
surround headset featuring a genuine
Dolby 7.1 headphone USB adapter check
out the link in the video description to
learn more I don't want to bore you so
let's get the specifications out of the
way really fast here the galaxy s7
active rocks a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
CPU there is no X no spurgeon for some
markets this time around and Adreno 530
GPU and 4 gigs of ram making it
competitive with a nearly identical to
plus or minus a Giga Ram here are there
any other flagship smartphone on the
market on the back is AD brand skin so
you can't see the abhorrent color scheme
you're welcome along with the 12
megapixel rear camera that I know and
love a two-tone flash and wireless
charging under the hood on top is a
noise cancelling microphone and a
headphone jack in my preferred position
on the right is a nice clicky lock
button and a tray for a single SIM card
and microSD card this can be used to
extend the 32 gigs of built-in storage
on the left is a volume rocker that
feels good but is regrettably right
across from the lock button derp and the
active key something I wish Samsung and
other manufacturers for that matter
would add a lot more of to their
smartphones because this thing is great
it acts as a shutter button when the
camera app is open and there are three
different actions bound to single double
and long presses if you don't care about
activity zone where you don't have
DirecTV or whatever you can change them
to open any app you'd like now I'd still
love to see more flexibility here like
being able to directly call a contact
turn on the flashlight activate my
mobile hotspot or whatever else but it's
something I found myself using a lot
even the way it is now on the bottom is
the main microphone and a microUSB
charging port hopefully a new VR headset
comes soon so Samsung can switch to type
C and a bottom mounted speaker that is
decidedly
status-quo I'd like to see everyone
taking HTC's approach with an upgraded
earpiece
speaker giving the phone not necessarily
stereo but dual speaker sound next to
the earpiece is the same 5-megapixel
selfie camera from the s7 so it's good
if a little bit too wide making noses or
other facial features appear oversized
under it is the 5.1 inch Gorilla Glass 4
covered 2560 by 1440 AMOLED screen that
continues to impress me with it's not
overly saturated colors considering this
is a Samsung OLED we're talking about
and fantastic visibility in all
conditions including direct sunlight
beneath that yeah okay so these are
hardware buttons they're still here
they're a bit of a love it or hated
thing personally I got used to them
pretty fast and it was nice to not have
to worry about pressing back with my
palm while reaching across the keyboard
or accidentally closing videos all the
time in landscape mode but your mileage
may vary alright so last time around the
big draw to the active model was the IP
68 ingress protection rating compared to
the s6 is complete lack of official
water resistance that's why I loved it
so much even though it lacked a
fingerprint sensor something that has
made it feel surprisingly obsolete in
the last year as more and more
third-party applications LastPass is one
that I use multiple times every day are
making use of this feature
fortunately the middle home button has
won this time around making the active a
full no compromises s7 experience which
is good because the regular models
picked up damn impressive water
resistance this time around with rs7
beating out offerings from Sony and kaya
Sarah in this sea water depth challenge
which you can check out right here
let's talk other trade-offs you lose the
sex appeal for sure the active is
noticeably heavier and thicker with
bigger bezels but in addition to water
and dust proof Ness the active is rated
for drop resistance though it should be
noted that if you drop anything enough
times it will eventually break and it
features a whopping four thousand
milliamp hour non removal
battery which combined with Samsung's
good power management in the latest
TouchWiz resulted in me making it as
close to two full days as I ever have
with a smartphone since I started
reviewing them about a hundred and
seventy-five percent of a day unfreaking
real it is a TNG exclusive so 4G band
support is a little more limited because
it doesn't need such broad compatibility
but I didn't run into any issues with
reception on my carrier that stupid
message that was always in the tray with
the s6 active when it first launched is
gone and most of the ATT stock apps can
actually be fully disabled this time so
they don't continue to run in the
background
TouchWiz continues to improve so I don't
have a ton of comments there other than
keep up the good work ladies and
gentlemen and the camera is the same
camera that continues to outperform
pretty much everything else in terms of
launch speed shutter speed image quality
low-light I love the s7 s camera so then
is the active better than the regular s7
is it worth the price Delta well that's
actually hard to say but battery life is
amazing that was the only thing that
kept the droid turbo ahead of the s6
active for me last time around and
software support for the s6 active has
been confidence-inspiring even if you
need to use ADB to upgrade it outside of
America
but there is one nagging issue one that
I thought I was imagining when I
couldn't reproduce it on camera and left
it out of my s6 active review both the
s7 active and its predecessors touch
screens leg occasionally the most
obvious symptom of which is double
presses especially fast ones resulting
in a long press while typing
frustratingly I was once again unable to
reproduce it on camera due to the
intermittent nature of the issue but
especially side by side with the touch
latency optimization of the HTC 10 it is
noticeable other than that this phone is
the absolute no compromises bomb and it
gets a very strong recommendation
especially if you're the kind of person
who was going to buy an s7
and then spend a hundred bucks on a
battery bank and a rugged case anyway
speaking of accessories for your phone
especially ones that save you from
incidental dings and scratches debrand
skins head over to D brand comm we've
got a link in the video description and
check out their high quality precision
cut vinyl skins they've got them
available for phones tablets game
consoles game controllers and even
laptop computers these days and the best
thing about D brand aside from the fact
that they fit perfectly and are easy to
apply and they're high-quality and they
stay on and all that stuff you'd expect
from a vinyl skin but unfortunately
don't usually get the best thing is the
configurator with the configurator you
can see all the different zones that you
can change the colors of and you can
swap them out in real time building the
perfect device that is exactly your
style and that perhaps no one else would
even want so check it out again that's
linked in the video description d
brand.com they're great guys over there
and they make great skins and they ship
worldwide so thanks for watching guys if
this video sucks you know what to do but
if it was awesome get subscribed maybe
buy an s7 active over at Amazon we've
got a link down there in the video
description or some other phone-a
ultimately it makes very little
difference to me or even consider
