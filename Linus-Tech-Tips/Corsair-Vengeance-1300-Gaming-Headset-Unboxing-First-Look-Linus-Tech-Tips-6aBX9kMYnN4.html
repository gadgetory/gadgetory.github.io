an analogue gaming headset made by
Corsair company you may or may not have
heard of they make some RAM and some
cases and some power supplies some
coolers and now they make peripherals
including keyboards mice and headsets so
this is for intensive gaming with
audiophile quality it comes with a
two-year warranty and let's see what
they have to say for themselves on the
back the Vengeance 1300 gives you gaming
audio the way it was meant to sound
accurate detailed and compelling the
custom-engineered 250 millimeter drivers
and careful acoustic tuning work and
harmony to deliver the audiophile grade
sound you need for an immersive
rewarding gaming experience so what they
mean to say is they're pretty freakin
sweet and let's open these up and have a
look now head headset packaging has been
a bane of my existence for as long as
I've been doing in boxing videos so
let's see how difficult it is to get the
Vengeance 1300 Wow these look really
nice out of the packaging oh wow no way
it was that easy that's amazing
okay let's see what else they've got
included here not much in terms of stock
do not return this product to the store
return it to Coursera or talk to us
first before returning it there's a
little warranty guide ok now let's have
a look at the headset itself so I'm
gonna go in the opposite order of my
vengeance 1100 unboxing and I'm gonna
show you the headset first so we've got
very comfortable Patti looking foam here
I'm not quite a hundred percent certain
why they bothered to pad the top of it
but I'm sure there is a reason for it if
anyone can figure that out please go
ahead and tell me but at least they did
not put padding on the top and then
neglect to put padding on the bottom in
fact the padding on the bottom feels
significantly thicker than the padding
on the top and gaming for long sessions
you are going to find that the comfort
of your headset is a huge factor in the
comfort of your gaming overall so nice
thick padding there nice thick padding
around the ears look at these check that
out look at how long it takes to come
back out after I press on it that is a
very very nice very soft foam there that
is going to provide
excellent comfort compared to competing
solutions there's also a bit of a of a
plethora feel to it so my initial
impression of these just based on
looking at them is that they're probably
more of a closed design so they're going
to be less audible to people around you
and they're going to isolate outside
noises better than other headsets that
are not although I don't have any
confirmation on that based on the
packaging itself or based on anything
else that I have access to that is just
my okay hold on the closed backup design
helps you enjoy private interruption for
gaming with the comfort you need for
hours of play if I have read further
into this I wouldn't have the
confirmation I needed so yes these are
closed headphones all right next we have
the microphone itself which has a nice
Hey look at this look how long the
flexible part of this microphone is so
you can actually adjust it to whatever
angle you desire even if you want it to
stick straight out like this you can do
that because the flexibility is all the
way here and even all the way over here
so you have a very wide wide range of
angles that you can adjust to you have
your ports on the one side you got your
ports on the other side okay and then
let's have a look at the overall
aesthetic I mean the HS ones are a nice
product sound good good value however
they didn't have as good of a look as
the Vengeance 1310 so I'm going to go
ahead and put these on I'll do a little
bit of modeling for you guys here so
I'll show you how you can adjust these
to be alright in your mouth if you want
or you know sticking way away from your
mouth if you want that for whatever
reason okay so let's go ahead and show
you what they look like from the back
okay show you what they look like when
you're intensely concentrating okay
that's what they'll look like okay and
then finally let's work our way down the
cord to the features that are included
okay so first of all very long cord
you're gonna be able to reach around the
back to your computer or the back here
yes back of your house very very long
cord seat yeah okay and moving on
further down we have a microphone mute
switch and we have volume control these
are both in line
and the warranty is void if you break
the seal interesting okay and then
finally at the very bottom we find
headphone jack and microphone jack these
are going to go into the back of your
computer or the back of anything else
that connects to headphones and a
microphone I suppose alright I think
that pretty much covers it Cameron can
you think of anything I missed
cameraman says no so I think we're good
to go
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the Vengeance 1300 remember this
version does not come with a USB audio
adapter but I believe there is a version
that will so don't quote me on that but
leave a comment I think it'll be like a
vengeance something slightly higher
number and it will include that which
basically plugs into these and plugs
into a USB port you always have that
option remember the HS one was the USB
one DHS 1a was the non USB one so this
is an a an analog equivalent and after
we turned off the camera we both
realized something we missed so these
hinges here are very very flexible which
means going out or what the shape of
your head is even if your head shaped
like this the headphones are gonna sit
comfortably on your head even if your
ears are on the back of your head okay
so there'll be no issues there and if
you have a really tall head that'll be
fine too so if you have a really tall
head or your ears are positioned along
your jawline you'll be in good shape</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
