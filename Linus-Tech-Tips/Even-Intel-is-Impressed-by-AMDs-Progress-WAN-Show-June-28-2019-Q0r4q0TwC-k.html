welcome to the Rancho ladies and
gentlemen if you have any issues viewing
the stream go ahead over to twitch.tv
slash Linus tech it seems to be working
just fine on Twitch we have done as much
diagnosis as we can while the stream was
offline and as far as we can tell we
have no idea yeah it started working on
a test Channel and it looks like it's
still a little borked right now yeah so
that's pretty sweet
I don't know yeah so there you go it's
just doing the same thing it just yeah
well it was yellow for a while at first
on the test stream as well so we don't
know it doesn't say anything Jake
hovering over it does nothing it just
says okay viewers may be experiencing
minor issues and then it'll probably
turn green again it was green while
everyone was complaining last time so we
are gonna start over we've got a great
show for you guys today the big news I
mean oh yeah
Johnny I've is leaving Apple but it's
also not the end of the world because he
is going to continue I be involved ok
yeah so Apple might be ok I guess or I
mean it depends on whether you think
Apple is ok now okay you know what about
it more later Intel Intel's internal
memo reveals that they are impressed by
AMD's progress now that is a high praise
indeed that is for it to be in an
internal memo that's pretty high praise
but again like I said before we killed
the stream internal memos are basically
just blog post now have you read the
memo though no it's pretty impressed
we'll talk we'll talk about it most of
our also known this was going to hit
media and going to hit AMD yeah I guess
I I don't understand what they could
possibly yeah okay we'll talk about it
more later yep
I'm sleep or 2.0 spec announced and it's
amazing and probably I'm assuming still
won't work at good distances and a laser
can identify people based on heartbeat
out over 600 feet away which sounds
not creepy at all I love that intro role
that intro loom this headphones is that
closing active I don't know
right
oh they're fuckin way back there
we got this so today's brought you by
savage jerky madrenas and Squarespace oh
here comes a train that's what we needed
yeah that's what we needed more more
issues okay yeah perfect so it's Friday
ladies I will say in the amazing video
that I don't know if it's on YouTube or
not yet but the high refresh rate gaming
video yes that actually hit YouTube
yesterday the train segment was
hilarious that actually happens far more
often around here than you guys would
probably think I mean it's one of those
challenging things where the only place
that you can find affordable commercial
real estate go figure
happens to be next to the train tracks
because nobody wants to live there
because nobody wants trains rolling by
all times of the night and day when
they're trying to sleep or gold out
their daily lives yeah it's just
something that we have to deal with
because I don't even I don't even know
if there is any industrial no nutrition
not near either train tracks or like a
superhighway superhighway heavy trucking
Road yeah something like that
yeah so anywhere where you're where
you're gonna have a ton of noise
pollution that's where you stick your
commercial zoning at least here in the
in the Vancouver area so the reason the
reason that it was particularly bad in
that video and that it interrupted us
more than it normally would like
sometimes we would just roll through it
like right now the trains going you guys
can't really hear it was because in
order to shoot high refresh rate video
we had to have the bay doors open to get
as much natural sunlight in as we
possibly could that's why it was a
problem interesting so every time you
double your frame rate you lose an
f-stop is that right Brandon lose a stop
yeah okay so when you go from 30fps
which is what we normally shoot at 260
you lose a stop when you go to 120 you
lose another you go to 240 you lose
another you go to 480 you lose another
then you go again to a thousand you lose
yet another one so by the time you turn
something up to a thousand frames per
second if you were trying to use the
same lights that we're using right now
at 30 frames per second you're basically
King at a dark frame yeah like there's
not much left actually could we could we
compare that or could we yeah yeah like
do we have enough apertures on this
camera this is great oh hey we got the
readout on OBS so everyone used to see
that that's kind of cool nice okay so
we're here yep this is 30 frames per
second so there's a stop so remember
this is going from 30 to 60 okay so now
we're at 120 this is what it would look
like at 240 that's what it would look
like at 500 frames per second and then
this is what that's a recording ACK so
guys to put that into the proper context
it looks so bright now the on screen
displays
oh yeah do you mind Brendan thank you so
to put that in context right now we're
shooting with two six-foot softboxes in
order to well look natural so I so yeah
so you basically need direct sunlight
now normally when you're shooting in
direct sunlight you would actually apply
what's called a neutral density filter
ND filter directly to the front of the
lens in order to block out a ton of the
light but when it's high refresh rate
you're dealing with you want as much
light as you can possibly get even with
as much natural light as we could get
some of it was still pretty dark
especially in the upcoming mouse latency
testing video that we'll be releasing in
the next little bit here people are
discussing apertures Oh like Aperture
Science we didn't turn monitoring off
those headphones are still clearly used
yeah hopefully unplug them not a problem
yeah I could I said around the back oh
sorry I thought I was on the front no
it's way around the back okay that's
oh boy oh geez I'm just gonna like bury
them put them under your shirts okay
cool shut up okay
sounds good this is the problem I run
into whenever I'm not the one who sets
things up because it's like it's not
complicated it's just you know which
which audio source is map to which
output but like if I didn't do it I
don't know exactly the way that someone
else configured it yeah and there's also
hardware ways to do that with our setups
it's like your dad setting up your home
theater system in the 90s like no one's
allowed to touch it you know Logitech
Harmony remote changed my life because
it's relatively speaking
once you get your IR blasters position
that's the main challenge is getting
your IR blasters in all the right places
so that it actually consistently
activates and deactivates things also I
had to contact Logitech support to
change I think it was either my TV or
receiver I had to get them to add the
menu option for power on and power off
instead of a toggle no it was my home
theater PC that's what it was so the
only option by default is power toggle
and as if anyway if you've ever used a
universal remote before you'll know why
that's a freaking problem yeah because
as soon as it D synchronizes every time
you try to turn this on turn it turns it
off yeah and you you end up in this
stupid flip-flop you have to get up off
your butt which is what you didn't want
to do always play video games or watch
TV yeah you have to get up off your butt
and go manually turn it on and off and
so so hit this I complained about this
they went oh yeah that's a known issue
we have to go into your harmony account
and add that option for you and I went
that's not a solution so yes my home
theater works perfectly but can I
recommend a harmony remote to someone
else who has a media PC as part of their
TV setup no I can't
because that is a phenomenally stupid
solution to the problem that should just
be an option because for pretty much
everything else in my setup so I could
decide what the activity was so for your
activity you can decide what the
commands it sends out okay so my TV has
power on or power off or toggle I can
decide and what that's when you launch
and when you end the activity you can
tell it which ones to do but for
whatever reason PC didn't have that
option at least when I said so as
someone who never nomads how to Harmony
remote why do you even have to tell it
that it's a PC well when you you have to
tell it it's a PC because whenever it
takes the IR input which is watch PC is
what I call mine so watch PC it then
needs to blast out one after the other
all the things that go with it so it has
to say receiver fire up receiver change
to this input re and then it has to go
TV fire up TV make sure you're on this
input then it goes PC wake from sleep so
it has to know what that code is
supposed to be okay so so mad because I
was like holding my old Microsoft media
center remote and I was like okay we
have on and we have off so clearly those
codes exist because some devices don't
have it yeah and that's just a problem
on the device level yeah so it so
basically if you want to recommend this
to anyone of the home theater PC you
have to say buy it like before you even
leave the store or no you'd have to set
up an account you have to get home and
part of the account creation process is
cause I'm gonna have to yeah you're just
gonna have to get now in Logitech's
defense the harmony support team was
excellent okay but it still made me
really mad that I had to talk to them to
do another thing that I should be able
to do within the menu talking to anybody
makes me mad so like totally hear you
why don't we move into like the big news
this week yeah Johnny I've leaving Apple
so for those not familiar
he's the bald guy with the Brita
accent in the commercials yeah
unapologetically plastic guy yeah so
he's he's their chief design or was
chief design officer he's leaving the
company Apple announced it on Thursdays
that's yesterday he's considered and you
know I guess it depends who you ask I'm
sure there's by many people I'm sure
there's lots of people internally at
Apple we're like yeah maybe it's time to
move on you know it depends who you ask
I suppose but he's considered one of the
most important people at Apple
responsible for the industrial design
and the look and feel of all major Apple
products including the iPod iPhone and
the Mac which really raises the question
all the other people there do ya know
I'm serious design department yeah I'm
actually serious right now
because they have so many designers it's
it may be like taking his ideas and
actually creating them like does he just
draft ideas maybe and here's another
question Apple doesn't actually have
that many products or okay another thing
okay to be fair about with Apple as they
seem to over credit individuals really
hard core right so that like this
individual person is responsible for
everything that happens a lot with Apple
so maybe he's the chief design officer
so maybe he ran those things for all
major products but I have that's not the
way that it gets communicated
I completely agree but that has been a
thing with Apple for a long time so
either Apple basically runs on like
eight people yeah or there's maybe
something else going on because this has
been true for like the history of Apple
so anyway sure people are gonna be on me
including an iPod iPhone and Mac so he's
worked at Apple for more than 20 years
and he's gonna start his own design
business called love from with capital L
capital F which I'm sure is very
important extremely an Apple will be his
first client so he says while I will not
be an employee I will still be very
involved I hope for many many years to
come he doesn't have an immediate
successor so yeah sure thing there's a
couple of åland I
Evans Hankey will report to Jeff
Williams the Apple's chief operating
officer while I've reported directly to
Tim Cook there was a note in here that
says I've was first noticed by returning
CEO Steve Jobs because of his colorful
design concept of the iMac so was he the
like carry it by the handle colourful
transparent iMac guy if I recall
correctly yes that makes sense in terms
of timeline yeah
gosh I'm old okay no so anyway that's
both a big deal and then also sort of a
nothing burger just because he's still
gonna work with Apple he's just hot take
I don't think they've had very inspiring
design for a while well okay so this is
where I okay so this is where it gets
kind of so I say a lot that I feel like
Apple products are designed for people
who don't have a lot to do so if you
look oh okay hold on yeah quick pause
sure when's that competition happening
uh oh not for a few weeks I think okay
yeah so what he's referring to is the
editing showdown
Jonathan Morrison from TLD is going to
be coming up here to compete in an
editing showdown with our very own Taryn
van humored it was just obvious like you
guys should have a like quick hot takes
about the other platform thing before
the competition like independently so
Taryn and Jonathan will make their own
comments but I am not there to
editorialize oh I will be mostly hosting
the showdown oh cool that's cool we also
are working on absolute celebrity judges
oh god I'm not going to comment on their
status yet because I don't want there to
be any like pressure on them or anything
but I have certainly reached out for the
premier side of things we we wanted a
panel of four judges two that are more
steeped in final the final cut ecosystem
okay and two that are more premier folks
okay and so I have reached out to
Eber from Hardware connects as well as
Niko from the corridor digital crew oh
cool and I have received receptive
responses from both but neither of them
are confirmed okay so I would love to
have them on our panel of celebrity
judges but it's always complicated
coordinating people with such busy
schedules oh yeah here in the studio
difficult angle it really and I don't
blame them at all I totally got it
because my schedule is stupid I
literally have no idea when he's in the
country or not okay so back to my back
to my point about Apple products
seemingly being designed for people who
don't have a lot to do have you ever
used Apple's calendar app no it's
utterly worthless than you really like
you you just Google counters great you
can't even Google calendar okay so yeah
that's good so even Google calendar
compared to there's a third-party app
called business calendar that's only
available for Android it's not available
on iOS and it is full beast mode like
tiny text you can configure it this way
you can have like tiny text so you can
actually read everything and you can
actually tell what the hell you're
looking at meeting coordination in
Google Calendar is fantastic though yes
so that's the main thing I like using it
for Apple's calendar app by comparison
simply has no way to configure it with
the same degree of display density okay
so it seems to make the assumption that
you either don't have a lot on your
plate or you have all the time in the
world to drill down and look at things
oh you mean like okay I thought you
meant in terms of one like you want to
be able to read everything of one task
but you mean you can read your entire
day by making it all really sure you can
read the entire month
like all the agenda items for that day
from the month view on this business
calendar app and it's just it's a whole
other level like I I was telling Yvonne
because she had issues with she had some
issues with Android cuz let's face it
there are some issues with Android yeah
she had some issues with Andrew and I
said look why don't you try an iPhone
for a bit and she tried it and she was
like this is completely unusable because
there isn't a replacement she tried
every calendar apps
i OS also really annoying I have to
carry one now and it won't stop yelling
at me and vote Apple pay yeah yeah I
know right and like everything else it's
like hey you should use this feature I'm
gonna pop up ten million times I don't
want this to turn into a rant about iOS
yeah but if you don't have a sim in it
there's no way to disable the hey
there's no sim installed I know you're
an iPod right now okay I don't know
buddy right past butter deal with it it
cannot handle that's like no I am i
phone yeah I am a phone where is your
SIM card
I deserve a SIM card I was born with sim
card privilege so yeah oh yeah look at
this asteroid week says our asteroid
says week mode and business calendar is
the best yeah yeah pretty much is so
it's pretty waiting so I end up I end up
with this sort of observation almost
every time I go to use an Apple product
because the amount of sort of manual
drilling down of things just annoys me
and you know what iPad OS looks like
it's going to address a lot of my
complaints about iOS on a large screen
device iPad has been very I seems
determined to resurrect this sort of I
won't say failing but I will say
stumbling business unit they've had a
really hard time convincing anyone who
already has an iPad that they should get
a new one and that's been my I still the
only tablet in my house is an iPad 2
because a lot of the things are gonna do
with it doesn't really matter you can
still do it just be fine put the kids in
front of it when I need a break that's
basically it's only you entertain the
young one like and the thing to use
nerds I don't even use it for that that
often but it's still perfect for that
because it's an iPad so you leave it for
two weeks and the batteries still alive
you can never do that with an Android
tablet yeah and so the very occasional
time that I use it it's ready to rock
and I can
take a nap the nap machine the nap
machine this machine creates the eye net
that would actually be an adorable
commercial they would never do that
Apple's marketing collateral is all
about what a creative intellectual
person their product turns you know but
like you know like getting a rest it
would be cool if they just named it like
a million different things and they
could even go back to that like put the
eye there and then rotate the word and
think of like like for this person it's
the eye nap and it creates naps for them
for someone else that's like the I
create and they can throw that yeah crap
in and then for someone else it's its
eye game whatever I feel like that could
be actually kind of energy they would
never do it would never do it speaking
of things I thought they would never do
Intel internal memo reveals they're
impressed by AMD's progress yeah this is
kind of hilarious as well so I'm gonna
try and bring up the actual memo because
it's freaking awesome okay yeah here it
is on tech power up if you guys want to
read the whole thing make sure you head
over there but basically here we go we
are now entering the latest chapter of
the tech industry single long running
business rivalry Intel and AMD have been
competing for many of the same chip
customers for more than 50 years oh wait
no this is dangit this is tech power-ups
introduction where's a Intel's thing
following a muse blah blah oh here it is
why AMD is now a formidable competitor
Wow is actually not alone a subheading
in the internal memo that alone is huge
right oh man so they basically go yeah
they've had two years of greater than
twenty percent annual revenue growth
thanks
basically to Rison and epic and then
they pretty much attribute it not
entirely but a big part of it to the
strategic refocus on premium high
performance products now I do have to
look at that and go I feel like it's a
little bit oversimplified and more even
misleading yeah I'm sure if AMD could
have built high performance products
five years ago they would have they just
had nothing yeah like they had
straight-up nothing a link until right
now I mean it's not like it's not like
Zen
doesn't scale down to low performance
products they can do a quad-core
processor if they want yeah I mean okay
back to a particularly dark time in
AMD's history they could build a tri
core processor basically what did - yeah
they just don't those are they're not
stuck making just that like it scales
down just fine the issue was they just
had nothing anyway back to back to the
art and back to the memo though so key
AMD competitive threats are from
high-end products I also think that's
kind of that's kind of another funny one
because what do you mean by high-end
products specifically the key AMD threat
is across your entire product stack all
the way from like hundred to two hundred
dollar CPUs which last I checked is
pretty low-end yeah all the way to many
core data center products which yes is a
high-end product maybe what they're
referring to here specifically was AMD's
focus on AP use because that was the
whoops
AMD's focus on AP use because that was
the only thing that they could build
that had competitive performance and
only because their onboard graphics were
so much better than intel's
not because the cpu cores were
competitive maybe that's what they mean
by this but like i think again that's a
little misleading because almost
everything intel's built in the last few
years on the consumer side is an APU by
AMD's definition yeah the height of the
APU wore was kind of a pretty weird time
it was a very weird time because
everyone wanted to like I think people
wanted to support AMD so everyone would
flex the APU GPU performance yeah and
then no one would run it that way
because it wasn't really good enough for
almost anything so really awkward time
uh hi ed what can I do for you how badly
do you need them we can get that next
week cool
cool thanks dad
okay so let's let's have a look at some
of the other some of the other
subheadings here so you man this like
this is like a scary time to be Intel
like I can see why they're sending out
this memo it's like look guys we have to
acknowledge this stuff AMD has recently
been gaining some traction and winning
public cloud offerings that's a pretty
big deal yeah
AMD's upcoming next generation Zen core
products codename Rome for servers and
matisse for desktop will intensify our
desktop and especially server
competition intensify the forward
firepower
[Laughter]
the latter is likely to be the most
intense in about a decade which is
another way of saying AMD had nothing
for 10 years
yeah and it's true okay I mean they're
even acknowledging the notebook and the
notebooks and business PC competition
that's incredible
now this is again sort of misleading by
leveraging tsmc 7 nanometre
manufacturing and be no longer
manufactures its own chips they got to
get that in there and II can drive
hiring troops and higher performance now
they they acknowledge it later on in the
memo but that's not really the main
reason that AMD is able to drive higher
core counts and performance yes Global
Foundries did stumble we know this but
AMD wasn't on TSM C 7 nanometre node for
rise in Gen 1 and risin Gen 1 was a
return to competition really it just has
more to do with AMD's modular approach
to their core design that is a big part
of the reason that AMD can drive higher
core counts and AMD has been driving
higher core counts than Intel for a
couple of years now the big thing that's
happening now is the IPC improvements
with Xen 2 that are making these many
core desktop processors now competitive
even in single threaded tasks allegedly
this is all still based on AMD data
and/or
Leakes what can I do for you oh yes
here's a prompter remote Thank You
Dennis so one thing that I think is kind
of going on in parallel to this is
intel's community communication and
marketing whatever you want to call it
not necessarily PR to the masses because
it seemed to be pretty on top of at the
very least communicating with enterprise
level stuff but enterprise level stuff
other than trust in terms of it will
work doesn't really care that much nope
they'll use a lot of these so the thing
that you guys got to understand is for a
consumer they buy something with the
expectation that it has already been
validated for them if you're designing a
supercomputer like if we were to go to
the very very high end of the enterprise
space if you're designing a
supercomputer you are in some ways
expecting the hardware to have problems
and you aren't expecting that you are
that you are engineering a solution
around them as part of your design
process that's the reason why you'll see
the latest supercomputer spinning up
when there's literally a generation
newer hardware available to consumers or
to the SMB market or whatever the case
may be because that design process
happened you know 18 to 24 months ago so
yes they get early access to the
hardware so that they can work on this
design but there's there's only like
there's only so much you can do look
this look is just not finished yet yeah
but I think I think I noticed something
so I went to a lot of conventions I got
pax is like crazy no it's kind of stuff
and Intel started doing something where
they pulled out of conventions yeah I
was in conventions yeah for a very very
long Hugh jetpacks up until like a
couple years ago I think yeah and it was
like at the start of pax and until was a
big deal there and they held a big deal
position for a very long time and their
booth kind of shrinked and eventually it
became a little bit less experienced all
and check out our crazy products and it
became look at our partners products and
stuff like that but it was still there
it was still really interesting it still
brought actually a lot of people in
compared to many booths on the floor
that were hard
we're based they were very active I know
like Coursera was really active in stuff
too but they were very active and then
an AMD didn't really exist
ambu is not what are you doing I'm
spamming twitch.tv slash Linus tech in
the chat because people are complaining
about the leg we don't know what the
issue is but it's something to do with
YouTube but then again it's yeah so for
whatever reason our stream is perfect on
Twitch just going to be actually most
confusing part is that it is working on
Twitch but yeah it's cool so here we go
but yeah so right around when Intel who
had dislike literally complete market
share although there's only two of them
four processors showing up at
conventions they disappear AMD shows up
an AMD show that was literally the most
perfect timing for AMD and the worst
timing for Intel ever because Intel
loses this like and I know ROI and
conventions is like ridiculous and
terrible and hard to track but don't
talk too much about that though we have
our own convention yeah but to tie into
that convention the sentiment you get
from those people yeah and these are
influenced really strong yeah and then
they're gonna go talk to their friends
and they're gonna talk on forums they're
gonna do everything else so it spreads
out like crazy and when you can have
that interaction as a hardware company
in person which you almost never have
it's super valued and that doesn't mean
that Intel not showing up all of a
sudden generates negative sentiment like
it's not that simple
but Intel loses their opportunity to say
you know hey we're good to right around
the time that AMD is coming in banging
this we're awesome right now drum we're
super awesome check it out
and like AMD shows up with crazy booths
now that are really interesting they're
doing giveaways they have like their
booths are banging and they show up out
of nowhere yes it's just a really and
that seems to be happening not just at
the convention level that's somewhere
where it's extremely tangible you can
see it happen Intel disappeared ambi
showed up and they completely took over
the convention space I've been asked as
a longtime Intel user by I forget what
there was over Twitter on our forum or
something I but I've been asked would
you consider an AMD chip for your next
rig
and I was like yeah of course like the
only reason that I'm not running AMD now
is that it isn't the highest performance
solution right now because the thing is
and I don't want like this is not this
is not a flex thing this is not like
trying to rub it in or anything like
that but I am NOT budget constrained for
my computer so I have had a lot of
people asked me over the last couple
years mm-hmm
well Amy's competitive why are you still
running Intel because it's faster I'm
gonna be the best option if you're
building different price your computer's
exactly so depending on what kind of a
price point you're targeting yeah aimed
you might make a ton of sense and I've
recommended AMD plenty but no I haven't
been using it because why would i well
that looks like it might change so
depending on how our evaluation of Rison
third gen goes yeah it's very possible
like people people treat me like I've
never had an AMD computer you know what
just for fun I'm gonna try and list out
all the processors I've ever run I can't
remember this every time you do this
like I have no idea what I had really
hard okay so the first CPU I ever owned
was a Pentium 90 like this was my
personal tower I inherited it from my
uncle it was a Pentium 90 in like the
early 2000s it was like pretty slow yeah
okay so then the first rig I ever built
for myself
f 1 XP 2500 plus heck yeah bought me
that 2500 plus baby then I got a 2500
plus mobile cuz it overclocked a little
better overclocked that thing to 3200
plus but guys AMD fans speaking from the
heart for heart to heart here okay we
were deluding ourselves if we thought
that a 3200 plus was actually equivalent
to a 3.2 gigahertz northwood see ok it
was not that was not a thing that was
real 2% of the audience understands
what's going on next CPU was I believe
it was a claw hammer
I want to say it was a 3200 plus it was
the one with less cash
um was it or was it north something
shoot okay so okay so sledgehammer was
FX only and then claw hammer was the
single core whatever it was a socket 754
single core Athlon 64 it was a huge
upgrade and the reason that I went to
that was because at the time games were
predominant basically exclusively single
threaded so hyper threading while it was
nice for your overall system
responsiveness did not make a difference
for games and games was 90 plus percent
of what I did on my rig so I picked up
an Athlon 64 single core okay my next
upgrade was to socket 9 3d 939 and the
reason that I had to go from 754 to 939
Oh super pissed off like that's another
thing
AMD fans are so quick to point at Intel
for retiring their you know their
motherboard chipsets so frequently and
making you buy a new motherboard it's
like don't don't imagine for a second
that AMD's hands are clean in all of
this either socket 754 lasted for like
10 months or something stupid like that
I can't remember what it was and 940 on
the desktop was even worse so I went to
socket 939 and pick myself up this was
the most expensive CPU I ever bought for
myself it was a 4400 plus and the reason
I went for that was because it was the
first consumer dual-core processor not
counting like I don't even know it was
Itanium multi-core I don't know it
doesn't matter the point was it was the
first dual-core processor that you could
buy for the desktop it was the full one
Meg cache was at 1 Meg per core or 1 Meg
can't remember compared to the 4200 Plus
which had less cache so that meant that
with overclocking you could get full
4,800 Plus performance which was other
than the FX line which was basically
dumb because it was just an overclocked
the other thing so other than the FX
line it was the fastest consumer chip
you could get so from my 4800 plus what
did I go - I got an OP Tron 165 are you
noticing a pattern here noticing a
pattern a lot of Andy Andy not funny
most of my growth was on AMD
as well so I got an OP Tron 165 and the
reason for that was it overclocked
slightly better that was around the same
time I picked up as rocks very unique
AGP and PCI Express board because I had
an Ag depart at the time and I wanted to
move to PCI Express related cool
it was a great overclocking board
shockingly other than the fact that you
couldn't run 1t on your memory timings
no matter what you did I tried
everything alright
from there I went to the e 6600 now why
would I do that
well because Conroe was a performance
revolution it was a complete game
changer it absolutely curb-stomped the
aging Athlon 64 and AMD didn't catch up
so from there I went to queue 6600 from
there I went to queue 9650 to very
temporarily I borrowed that one from
work I think it was a QX 9650 excuse me
borrowed that one from work deleted that
I believe I was the first person to ever
delete a QX 96 deleted a work thing
don't worry about it oh um interesting
from there
I picked up a core i7 920 man that was a
beast of a chip got myself ah this was
right around the time that Kim and I
went out of business so keen Honda yeah
remember c'mon yeah so there a neon
consumer line up of memory I don't even
know if this is interesting to people
they might not even be watching I don't
care so they're a neon brand they had
these one big games that they were
liquidating for I think our cost was
twenty bucks a pop and at the time that
was once yeah it was wild so NCIX bought
everything that we could take and
internally we were buying them at cost
so it was sick so I bought so I still
have some of that a neon memory okay
hold on one quick second here just sort
of interested in that era upgrading your
RAM was like a huge deal that's happened
a lot yes no no we were a little bit
after that Ram was not affecting gaming
performance anymore especially because
on the 1366 platform it was okay triple
channel memory a little bit before six
memory slots so when I had
were they to gig gyms I think they were
to gigs for 20 bucks they were if they
were to gig games for 20 bucks and you
could get the one gig ones for 10 I just
remember when when we first started
playing like EverQuest I never played
ever everybody had to go get more RAM I
had a like ever
Wow everybody that I knew had a dog go
get more ram in order to play over quest
but nothing else works I had a job and a
girlfriend I did not I was younger
though anyway sorry so okay so I went to
a 920 then I think at some point I moved
to like like an extreme addition on that
platform that I borrowed from work my
extreme that's the only reason why I
actually switched to Intel originally
was because I got a retail edge Extreme
Edition and I was like this deal is way
too good yeah so of course the price
performance here is wild yeah so retail
edge speaking of retail edge I believe I
went three thousand series through
retail edge and then that was right
around the time that I became a product
reviewer
and I started more legitimately getting
chips that I could use in my personal
rig yeah I'm work yeah so I've been
running Intel since then and actually my
personal rig even though I upgraded it I
did publish a video about that recently
I ended up downgrading it again so I'm
still running a 59 60 X so I am looking
for an upgrade I need Thunderbolt which
might be a problem or maybe I could just
run discrete cables I don't know I'll
figure it out USB 3 extension cables are
not bad time from my experience though
yes
nick is standing here very patiently
what can I do for you Nick what's up
dude I did okay I actually totally
spaced out because I had done it before
so you know what we should do our
sponsor starting with the LTTE store
Ellen GGG slash elemental so imma be
completely honest with you folks out
there this shirt has not been a great
mover for us so we are looking to - boy
do I have a deal for you ladies and
gentlemen it's actually crazy I'm gonna
blame Nick I'm gonna blame Nick oh I'm
also gonna blame myself for not wearing
them so because we know that whenever I
wear stuff on stream it actually
I very rarely see you in these shirts I
very I very very rarely very rarely wear
these ones so they're supposed to be
like not super over-the-top branded but
just like kind of kind of clean just
like our other shirts they're American
Apparel so they are super comfy and
they're available in red orange blue and
green I'm kind of partial to the orange
one but you know they're all kind of the
same they're in stock in all sizes from
small to triple XL and if you buy either
a hat or a water bottle both of which we
have plenty of stock of I actually would
have really liked to do this as a as a
coupon where you could just buy anything
and get 10 bucks off but there's a lot
of stuff that it's really popular like
the stealth hoodie the hard drive shirt
the cpu shirt that we just don't have
enough stock of and we were worried that
we would like launch this promo code and
then people would order it and then they
would all be gone so what did you guys
talk water bottles is that what happened
we restocked already water bottles like
flew out yep they were gone then we
restocked them though yeah so we're good
we have I think a couple thousand water
bottles right now so we should be okay
burn yeah I mean the store's been doing
really really well like a couple
thousand water bottles is like okay but
it's not it's not a ton you guys have
been incredibly supportive thank you so
all you got to do is add to cart' an
elemental shirt and either a hat or a
water bottle and you can actually use
the code which is elemental up to twice
so you could buy a hat and a water
bottle and get $10 off two elemental
shirts and then you go to checkout and
it will automatically apply the code for
$10 off the elemental shirt if you use
the LM d GG slash elemental or you can
do it manually at LT t store calm and
the code is elemental all caps died but
yeah but he didn't fantastic hi
gentlemen
our sponsors for the show today
Squarespace yes you need to create a
beautiful website without the hassle
we'll check out Squarespace their
all-in-one platform makes it easy to get
up and running quickly which is why we
use it for Lynas media group
calm as well as LTX Expo calm they've
got award-winning templates that you can
use as a starting point for a wide range
of projects and if you need additional
help
Squarespace offers webinars a full
series of help guides and you can even
contact their customer service 24/7 via
live chat and email if you've already
got a third-party domain you don't have
to give it up just transfer it over to
Squarespace and every Squarespace site
includes ecommerce features to help you
sell merch or services online and easily
manage your inventory and orders it
squarespace.com /when and offer code
when to save 10% on your first purchase
which I guess is a perfect segue into
our LTX 2019 update on our Squarespace
site the LTX 2019 Expo map is here yeah
that's the map so the BYOC entrance is
right here we've got dedicated bathrooms
for you dedicated gamers is there a
dedicated boo out the entrance to like
the convince you can use either but this
is the one that is closer to the BYOC so
we're gonna tell people go this way or
go that way and if you guys ignore us
you will ultimately be able to get where
you're trying to go it just will be less
efficient so question about BYOC stuff
is that like roped off or less okay yeah
so the guys are starting ahead of the
game because most conventions don't rope
off BYOC oh yeah you gotta have it roped
and then it's fine for a couple years
then things get stolen and then they
have to rope it up remember that the be
way right is not LTX right
it's dream hacks be yoc they're doing it
right so they know what they're doing
that makes sense so dream hacks free
players right here the BYOC is right
here the free play admin and the BYOC
admin is here and here this is the
stream studio I think they're planning
to bring some streamers yeah this is the
VIP special guest BYOC so that's where
you'll set up cool flow cleaning people
main stage meet-and-greet with creators
of which we have like two dozen coming
now how about the float where all the
flow plane people are is gonna be right
next to meet and greet for creators so I
can just try to like poach people as
they finish their meet and greets very
cool we're doing gladiator jousting
motherboard house of cards we have an
entire pallet of pcbs so people are
gonna be able to like build up you're
gonna try and build the tallest
house of cards from a pc b--'s there
will be prizes
we have so much prising nvidia sent over
a hundred pounds of grass it wasn't it
like oh you did it based on weight or
something yeah like r-tx 2080 is 20 70s
26 TSO tak is sending three pallets of
prising have they gone mad son what what
are they even drunking it kind of makes
sense okay I'm gonna give you another
pax history thing sorry early date early
days of pax it was much more
hardware-based I remember one year
Nvidia was an entire wall in the
singular convention center that there
was it's singular convention hall that
there was and like many many many more
Hardware booths and back then we would
come back from conventions with like
bags of swag and we would often like
technically make more off of swag than
we spent on the tickets and the trip in
general which was like wild but that
happened many times right now you're
lucky if you get like a few t-shirts
because it's all gaming companies I'm
not that surprised that this is going on
cuz it's a hardware based convention
it's the hardware guys are just like
yeah I take a bunch of stuff so which is
so cool
we have 3,000 people coming each day
assuming that we sell the rest of the
tickets and like Saturday will be 3,000
people yeah so I'm not saying everyone's
gonna get like a full outfit and a
gaming oh yeah no but we are doing our
best to source as much spread it owns
giveaway swag as we can and really we
want to encourage participation yeah if
people participate they will walk away
with something if people don't
participate it's gonna be a lot tougher
yeah that's kind of the way that I want
it to be I want LTI so should be highly
interactive yeah absolutely that totally
makes sense
so back to the layout Razer is gonna be
there this is gonna be fun there's an
escape VR there's actually a lot of VR
experience so is the escape VR like a
room that you have to move through or
something I don't know exactly how it
works but it's a third party company
that Lake does these cool yeah so it
should be pretty cool
it's an asleep trusting and then people
actually they can't hear you because
you're off mic it's an escape reminded
VR environment
there's trusting that don't worry it's
fine job there's also no regular vr
gaming and then there's VR which isn't
really VR cuz it's more just reality but
a camera person cars
there's remote cars board game lounge
food and beverage Memex is gonna be
there and the size gonna be there and
Zen excuse t is gonna be there be s mods
gonna be there anyway stuff cool so this
year there's actually gonna be a bunch
of different like hardware brands there
physically and it's gonna be hardcore
too like CPU do letting we're gonna have
a booth for that again so Roman they're
Bauer sent over a bunch of his D living
tools he's actually gonna be there by
the way that's cool GPU re pasting
that's happening Dreamhack Cindy
playground K Stas is back and you get to
boss an old Mac Pro cheeseburger kind of
really sick gigabytes gonna be there the
retro gaming lounge and vintage PC area
are gonna be super cool dreamhack indie
playground that's actually I love the
indeed parts of these kind of shows so
it's gonna be sick
don't miss it yeah yeah it's gonna be
sick don't miss it
show today savage jerky
yeah I got a nice little note from John
oh I have to try something new today
Oh ran out of maple bacon getting more
love John oh so you know what that's
fine the sriracha bacon is actually
really good
so I finally tried my Moho jalapeno hot
sauce yeah it's actually amazing my
favorite part about it is the aftertaste
so if you eat kind of slowly which I do
it's perfect you're the slowest eater of
all time which makes it perfect like
you're so slow yeah it's astonishing
mm-hmm
meanwhile David I went on a trip with
him
and we both ordered a pizza we were
sitting on the like the curb eating it
in Germany because I don't know why not
sure
so we're so we're like eating this pizza
we both need about half of our pizza and
well he ate his half a lot faster than
me anyway
we both got half a pizza left
walking around after we decide to like
walk back to the hotel cuz like we're
just chillin it's midnight yeah we're
all jet-lagged as hell huh
and he just like throws away his box and
I'm like dude like why'd you just throw
away food like that sucks
he's like not I did I was like I did not
I did not see you open the box and
remove food from it or put it in your
mouth the conversation never faltered
the guy inhales through never seen
anything like it
that's awesome savage jerky their goal
was to create a snack that's full of
flavor and spice but that isn't bad for
you
they've got 13 different flavors of
jerky like their sriracha bacon and
maple buffalo bacon which was my
personal favorite just looking at a
package of maple buffalo bacon makes my
mouth water they also make barbecue
sauce hot sauce and a spice rub their
Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of
the hottest peppers in the world the
Carolina Reaper and you can use offer
code LTT to save 10% on all their
products also they have a new amazing
offer by two maple Bacon's and get the
third one free no coupon code necessary
but it does not stack with the 10% all
right that's good to know they stand
here to make sure I'm gonna do the read
right well did you do this one is it one
more good - sriracha have you tried this
one Roger Bacon I don't think so Wow
that's really tasty they finally don't
you to try something out and you like it
well I'm still going back to the maple
bar okay I love at least it got a seal
of approval yeah
use code lioness to get 40% off at
madrenas coffee calm slash lioness
they've approved by no no I'm you know
the dream is coffee is coffee for fuel
organic cold brewed coffee and a
convenient 15 ounce can well with a
flavor for everyone they've got sweet
and creamy flavors like their mocha or
caramel and bold flavors like their cold
brew black we actually have a permanent
item on their store the lambo roast a
couple of feminism's lambo roast as well
as the vanilla cold brew so head over to
madrenas coffee calm / - and yet no way
these guys are nuts
50% off instead of the regular 40% off
for your entire order with code Linus
for the next 72 hours so
go go go go go and if you have any
questions about the various flavours of
cold brew or their micros slow mo for
madrenas is in the chat and ready to
answer your questions through direct
messages alright we've got a couple more
topics I think we really wanted to talk
about today DisplayPort 2.0 I hate
DisplayPort yep I love it when it works
yep
I hate it when it doesn't work yep and
it just it seems to not work for me at
the most inopportune times if you have a
monitor basically exactly next to your
computer fantastic if you have to do
anything funky with it ever it's
horrible
yeah it's wild hopefully they fix that
stuff in the new version I don't know
how much I trust that but you know
hopefully it's crazy fast 80 gigabit per
second of raw bandwidth effective
bandwidth of seventy seven point three
seven which is pretty nuts 8k 60 Hertz
HDR 8k at 60 Hertz later greater than a
greater than 80 K six year it's SDR 4k
at 144 Hertz
HDR on two times five case of dual
monitor yeah if you wanted to daisy
chain yeah okay at 60 Hertz so basically
this is the biggest leap forward in
DisplayPort bandwidth ever so one and
one point one we're eight point six
gigabit per second so you could do 1440p
at 60 Hertz which was a big deal at the
time yeah
1.2 doubled that more a little more than
doubled that so you could do 4k 60 Hertz
that was a big deal because prior to
that to run 4k you had to do two cables
dual cable like super piling on your
display was really cheesy it was bad
times not good
one point three and one point for could
do up to twenty five point nine two so
that was actually a pretty small leap
forward 4k 120 Hertz or 8k at 60 Hertz
with DSC which is if I recall correctly
that acronym is the compression are the
lossless compression and then finally DP
2.0 with I love this I love this the
like the acronym for the code name for
it whatever you want to call it is you
HBR which sounds like uber uber
twenty seventy seven point three seven
you give it per second so this is a
tripling in speed huge nut absolutely
huge so they've got not just one but a
few different bitrate modes the fastest
mode and DisplayPort 2.0 will top out at
eighty gigabits per second of raw
bandwidth to about two and a half times
that of 1.3 1.4 it also introduces a
more efficient coding scheme resulting
in less coding overhead so as a result
the effective bandwidth of the new
standard will peak at seventy seven
point four so that's three times the
physical characteristics the port itself
is staying
yes that's good both the port that we
have now and the USBC connector via the
DP alt node both the official ports for
the new DisplayPort 2.0 standard and the
number of pins and resulting high speed
data lanes is remaining unchanged so it
will continue to operate over four lanes
it also retains the packet based
approach to communication which means
that image data continues to be sent as
packets over a fixed bandwidth link as
opposed to pixel centric pixel clock
approaches and so what has changed is
that the rest of the physical layer has
been almost entirely replaced so
Thunderbolt 3 o with Thunderbolt 3 which
is now a royalty-free standard yeah and
is going to be called USB for I guess
except not quite because I think
Thunderbolt branding Intel is still
going to be using as sort of like their
best-in-class implementation of the USB
for standard that is sort of that has a
lot of optional components so
Thunderbolt 3 is truly bi-directional
full duplex link two lanes allocated for
each direction oh and DisplayPort is
focused on sending large volumes of data
in just one direction so DisplayPort 2.0
reverses the two inbound lanes to
outbound cool that's actually that makes
a lot of sense I'm stoked actually works
yeah yeah and I guess actually that's
kind of oh yeah we can talk the laser
one sure yeah so it's a new device
developed by the Pentagon after the US
Special Forces requested it basically
everyone has a cardiac signature and
they can read that cardiac signature
with an infrared laser apparently it
works through typical clothing like a
shirt or a jacket which surprised me Wow
apparently not a thicker like winter
coat but still a jacket which blows my
mind and I'm assuming they're gonna have
I'm kind of wondering if they're
including like windbreakers as a jacket
hard to say I don't know what if it's to
do with thickness or to do with layers
layers might be a problem too I'm not
sure but but yeah apparently cardiac
signatures are already in use for
security identification this has
happened before
Canadian company company that I'm gonna
butch the name of but I think it's Nami
has developed a wrist worn pulse sensor
as an alternative to fingerprint
identification a little little crazy
apparently it can take a little while
for it to kind of lock on but it does
work at a fairly far distance so it's
only really effective if the subject is
sitting or standing not really like
moving around and stuff got it yeah so
200 meters it works from pretty wild
that's crazy wild so one glaring
limitation is the need for a database of
cardiac signatures but even without this
the system has its uses but you could
probably pretty easily get that
especially at like passport stations
mm-hmm where people have to stand there
for a while you just install it and grab
it yeah yeah because you're handing them
a passport you're giving them your name
and all your information so yeah mash
that up and create a national database
really fast called jetson in practice
it's likely to be used alongside facial
recognition or other identification
methods but in the long term the
developers believe in addition to
identification it could be used to scan
for arrhythmias and other conditions
remotely and hospitals could monitor the
condition of patients without having to
wire them up to machines which I guess
is cool yeah but it's just yet another
way that Big Brother will be watching
and there's no real preventing it at
this point
yeah this one's kind of hard to screw
with the future is now yeah just start
wearing like a plate over your chest I
was thinking about but it's not just
that because I think it can see it
through your skin in general yeah I
guess they don't have a cardiac
signature in like your arm right yeah so
you'd have to have clothes
only solution led clothing you'd have to
have clothing that like ripples
intentionally like actively ripples
you'd have to have active clothing
active active IR camouflage all right
then show you guys see you again next
week same bat-time same bat-channel
goodbye see you later
it's a vibrating chain maille
it's a bitch super chats Oh birthday
Preston
happy birthday Wyatt lazy ak-47 says so
I get a pulse wait commercial any other
commercials you're in or will be in no
not at this time but it is a service
that Linus Media Group does offer like
commercial production it's not something
that we publicize a ton so the only
reason we ended up doing that with pulse
wave was just cuz like I don't know we
just kind of ended up chatting about it
like it wasn't yeah I don't even know if
it's on our website but yes it is
something that we do but no there's
nothing really planned right now bob
says cake or cupcakes you know I'm not a
cake guy or a cupcake can either give me
a good muffin oh yeah okay on this topic
because wonderful the same but this two
chocolate chip cookie oatmeal raisin
cookie chocolate chip whoa I don't have
had that it's amazing
oatmeal is just better in my opinion
okay sorry we can keep going I'm not
that into chocolate chip cookies because
they're usually crappy cookie yeah and
they just try to get by on the chocolate
yeah doesn't work that way yeah um alia
- will you ever tell us about that
colorful dragon tattoo you had about a
half year ago yeah I was just messing
with you guys it's just a spray-on thing
oh that people thought that was real a
lot of people did Wow
well I kept reapplying it so it looked
fresh for like quite a long time oh yeah
interesting yeah video suggestion a
collab with your Bower since he's coming
to LTX anyway the problem is that
everyone in their dog is coming to LTX
and they're coming for LTX and i'm gonna
be like scrambling in the lead-up to LTX
and then recovering from LTX so unless
they're like hanging around for a week
that's probably not gonna be feasible
other side guy would you agree that car
culture and building custom cars and
modding is similar to the PC space yes
oh yeah definitely
hey Linus decided to blow five bucks
just to see make a funny face
gap-toothed granny brian says Linus if
you feed yourself out I'm gonna Kermit
what is what is Kermit I don't know
david says lines been a huge fan of your
channel for years taught me a lot keep a
little good work thank you John says
Andy will probably move to four threads
per core before Intel just to fully not
kick them yeah they probably will Oh
what did I click I don't know Oh No the
down-arrow me Oh crud team oh I did I
got my new LTTE hat and hoodie with home
door delivery post girl did parently say
that so you didn't need to go to the
post office
man Canada Post rocks in Finland great
feedback
glad to hear showed up to my wife Claire
who is probably listening to this
tomorrow says SEAL team Rex hey cool
Midland says good evening - would you
ever consider building your own studio
and what would you need in your dream
studio what a tremendous question so if
I were to build my own studio first I
would start with a ground floor with
like a library for kind of like a quiet
place to sit and editing done for all
the editors to sit and work together and
collaborate like a camera area where we
can build up our rigs and tear them down
and store them safely and like maybe a
bathroom upstairs from that I put a
boardroom
I'd put my office I put an office for my
wife who does all the accounting so she
needs privacy I put another small office
just in case we needed it in the future
maybe a nice open space so that we could
put cubicles or something like that nice
nice another bathroom probably yeah then
I'd expand it okay okay so I'd put Nick
in my wife's office I'd put her in mine
and then I'd move over to the other side
where there would be three offices Luke
had one of them at one point but we
would have kicked him out by then we'd
leave one of them open for like meetings
yeah I'd take one of them then we'd have
like an open space for the writers
another bathroom the more people you add
the more people need to pee you know I'd
move the camera people out into the
warehouse at that point I probably start
with three warehouse you
and I'd do like a green screen like an
LTTE sat like a workshop a teklynx set
and then like some storage area maybe
maybe a little nook for the land show
then I'd probably get a couple more
units I'd add like an employee lounge
and some more storage and then maybe
like a hardcore workshop with like
modding stuff sweet yeah that's probably
die do smart consider it concise that's
what I do I was being facetious that's
our studio yeah what did he mean
probably didn't know that we have a
studio
oh I'm just teasing we have a studio
yeah we got our studio about four years
ago yeah well I could understand why
people don't know because we
intentionally changed the sets to look
like a house so anyone who started
watching in the last year or two might
not realize that the kitchen that we
shoot in all the time is not a real
kitchen that was the world yes so we
wanted the videos to look less like a
set in a studio and more like we just
shoot out of a house like a normal
youtuber but you do videos out in the
warehouse sometimes weird that makes
sense
Nicola I'm going to an English course in
Vancouver gonna missing LTX Oh
rude what can I do that's tech related
while visiting nicely not much Rita says
are you going to do something ridiculous
and cool with the Corning off go to 3d
three cable oh yeah go free geek do that
that's a good idea
thank you um yes I'd love to they're
supposed to send me one but they haven't
yet Joshua says there has been a way to
add special IR commands to the power
sequence on harmony for many years I
think Logitech didn't want to blame the
customer yeah so the problem was that I
couldn't so you have to pick from a menu
yeah we went over all that um other side
guy Ella IMO Edie's haven't particularly
taken off because the futuristic design
employed makes them look tacky yeah
that's a fair point it's only part of
the problem though yeah a poor except it
coin is on the rise again do you have
anything in the works for a mining
update nope
I'm out
uh Jake likes tech says this is going
toward a new stream PC that's not the
stream pcs not the problem also see what
LTX okay see you there Johnny says oh
gee you gotta make alt X just as big or
bigger or next year my boss told me he
will be pay next year due to he needs me
at work in the holidays I had set aside
for going so you better we'll try
I honestly can't promise that like we're
gonna have two dozen creators there
again cuz that is costing me a pretty
penny the show itself could expand
though yes and then maybe certain
creators will just want to go anyways
Ron says do you still write dress be
six-fifty yes other side guy what's your
thoughts on Australia being non-existent
in the tech and gaming industry it's
really far the only reason there's
actually a lot of tech fans in Australia
yeah and there's a huge amount of tech
sales that happen on Australia hmm so
the community is actually pretty decent
it getting a show out there is extremely
expensive if you're not based there
because pax has one
I think that's yeah yeah and it's
relatively small yeah but again it's
extremely expensive and getting a lot of
the creators out there show like pax is
at the scale where they're not generally
paying for creators to go so the
creators are gonna be sponsoring
themselves to go or getting sponsorships
to go and both of those are way more
difficult because it's really expensive
and they are oh I is a little bit
different it's it's a difficult market
but like yeah the the tech community in
Australia is actually very large vibrant
yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
