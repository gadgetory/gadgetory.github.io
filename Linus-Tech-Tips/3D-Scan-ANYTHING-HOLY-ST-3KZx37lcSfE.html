look around how much technology is all
around us I mean they're building
quantum computing chips to
municipalities away in Burnaby and down
the street from our office seriously
it's so close that we could hit it with
a potato cannon Excelsior measuring has
got a $30,000 laser scanner that they've
invited us to go take a look at so we're
walking there
it's a crazy cool piece of kit that
allows you to turn this into this and
this video is brought to you by thermal
take the therm will take core p90
tempered glass case features 5
millimeter thick glass and angled open
frame design a bunch of different layout
options with vertical GPU mounting with
a riser cable included and more you can
check it out at the link in the video
description
so this place is actually pretty cool
the owner daniel has been a longtime
viewer they've got a gigantic floor mat
when you walk in that's like Excelsior
and everyone from their book keeper all
the way up to the folks working on 3d
modeling or a graphic designer using
custom hand-built workstations so it's a
pretty cool vibe in this place anyway
this is the blk 360 and I've been asked
very nicely by the owner here not to
drop it I see my reputation has preceded
me somewhat but don't worry don't worry
an I'm experienced at this sort of thing
what is this costume anyway so this
puppy right here will do three separate
types of skins all simultaneously it
does photo it does 3d with what's called
a point cloud or something along those
lines and this little sticker right here
that I guess FLIR probably twisted like
his arm to include on it it also does
thermal scanning at the same time so
it'll actually record depending on the
quality of the scan that you're going
for anywhere from a hundred thousand to
three hundred and sixty thousand data
points per second as it
whirs around and spins around whether
it's a room or or outdoor or whatever it
is that you're trying to scan in terms
of accessories I don't often get to
unbox things that cost this much you get
a car adapter so you on your way to a
site you know if you're driving up to
Kamloops or something you can have it
charging up you get a battery you get a
wall charger with international adapters
and finally a battery charger for the
wall charger so you can charge the
batteries Wow
okay give me a second I gotta get all
this stuff of the way all right so let's
take a bit of a closer
look here well alright there we go so
that's it that's all there is to it it's
got like a blasted aluminum housing it's
got oh I guess I'm gonna need that berry
there we go
it's got a battery compartment at the
back smooth action on the door that that
is what thirty thousand dollars buys you
and then you got your power button on
the front and there's not a lot to it so
here on the back they've got three
fifteen megapixel cameras and what those
do is they take the photographic image
of the site so they will actually create
a 150 megapixel dome around the location
where the camera is set up so the doodad
in the middle is gonna spin around like
this and then the whole unit is gonna
spin around 360 degrees and it's gonna
basically measure the distance between
the blk 360 and all the objects around
it as as point data and then that will
all have to be assembled after the fact
now it can hold something to the tune of
a hundred scans on its built-in memory
and the accuracy of this so out to about
sixty meters is within four millimeters
so there are quite a few applications of
this technology but what Excelsior
measuring does with it is they get scans
of the outsides of buildings because a
lot of the time if you want to let's say
put an addition on a house or if you
want to change something about a
commercial construction project what you
have to do is you have to submit to the
city and as built measurement of the
building it's not good enough to send
blueprints because they might not have
been adhered to perfectly so in the old
days you would have to take like a like
a pocket laser rangefinder and just kind
of sort of math everything based on
angles this you just plunk it down in
the parking lot
press run and it gets you all of the
measurements
to within that four millimeter accuracy
I was talking about and it can actually
even run out in sort of a light mist its
IP 54 rated now it's not perfect it
doesn't handle or this model anyway
doesn't handle things like the inside of
a cave very well so for mining
applications they've got a more powerful
model because it doesn't handle like
blacks or dark blues or reflective
surfaces but for their application it
has proven to be very very useful but
I'm not talking about it they've
actually agreed to let us borrow it so
we're gonna take this back to our office
and get a 3d scan of the Lynas Media
Group building ok so here we are in our
set we're actually running a scan right
now we're probably gonna have to discard
this one because it's gonna have my face
in it but don't don't worry too much
about that basically what its gonna take
is about six placements here in our our
apartment set slash studio for us to
build such an accurate digital
representation of it that anyone who had
the file could go and create a real-life
recreation of this studio like that I
mean its construction so there's like
permits and stuff but but like like a
slow okay so now we're running the last
scan and then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna send all of this point cloud
data back with Daniel to his company
they're gonna process it and we're gonna
go check out the results tomorrow okay
so normally they have a week to do this
kind of stuff so we're gonna go a little
bit easy on them but we are back in the
office and Daniel's got a 3d scan of our
studio that we can actually just what
lifelike whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho holy crap so
this you guys is the bedroom set it goes
all the way up to the ceiling - okay so
Daniel's company uses this primarily for
measuring like surveying a construction
project as we mentioned before but this
tech has actually been known to be used
in the production industry as well so
what they could do
they could take a space or in our case a
set or a location and then they could
import this information because this is
all just just just like a point cloud
they can take all this information and
they can create a model in 3ds max or
Maya and then what they could actually
do is they could build up a set
including lighting locations and see
once they've rendered it out using
obviously quite powerful hardware what
exactly it would look like in real life
so it's super cool stuff that these guys
are doing here at Excelsior measuring
they're not like a sponsor for the video
or anything they're just a local company
that was literally down the street that
had a fun toy to play with that ended up
being actually even cooler than I
expected so hopefully you guys enjoyed

tips and the how did you hear about us
section so thanks for watching a huge
shout out to Daniel here for putting his
life on hold basically to get this done
and I think it was less than a 24 hour
turnaround for us really cool really
appreciate that
if this video sucked you guys know what
to do but if it was awesome hit that
like button get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured that is if you have a
commercial application for it I wouldn't
just buy one of these for fun we'll have
that linked in the video description
also down there's our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
