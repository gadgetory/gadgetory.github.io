the manufacturers website and download
the latest drivers but what I have never
actually done is showing you how if
there's anybody who doesn't know so
today I'm going to be giving you hope
helps if you spell in video right today
I'm going to be doing a video guide on
how to install Nvidia's graphics drivers
so I'm going to be installing the driver
for a GTX 480 card so the first thing
I've done is I've gone to Nvidia comm
and then I'm going to hover over I can
get my mouse to go there there we go I'm
going to hover over download drivers and
then I'm going to go to download drivers
so far this is pretty straightforward
okay so here we go now I'm going to
manually find the drivers for my nvidia
products so i know that i'm using a
geforce there's all the other options
here as well so i'm using a g4 so I'm
using a 400 series of 480 but they've
got options for all the other g4
serieses as well I actually have cards
in my in my storage room that go back as
far as this nothing here nothing here
anyway so this is a GTI GeForce 400
series the particular card I'm
installing drivers for is the 480 and
then I am using Windows 7 64 bit if you
want to check which copy of Windows you
have whether you're running Vista or
Windows 7 you just click on the Start
menu right click on computer go to
properties and then you can see right
somewhere right there system type 64-bit
operating system so if you need to
double check then just make sure there
that way you download the correct driver
for your system alright so we've got all
the options selected I speak English and
I don't think they have in English
Canada mmm
Queen's English excellent I'm going to
download the UK drivers just for fun ok
so you click yes it tells you the
drivers ok these are what coal certified
so it means they should be stable
they're good for Windows 7 64 bit shows
me here release highlights so you can
see how much stuff gets fixed and
updated drivers I don't I'll tell you
this for my own amusement I mean look at
this twenty four percent better perform
in this game 25% better in this game a
hundred and ten percent better in some
technology demo upgrades physics support
add support for new quality mode does
all this stuff so there's a reason that
I tell you never use the drivers that
come on the disk click the green
download always use the ones from the
manufacturers website so I'm going to
save these huh I'm going to save these
to the desktop and NVIDIA has a very
fast ok some UK ad NVIDIA has very fast
download server so at my home I am
getting almost two megabytes per second
down from Nvidia server that means even
though their drivers are a huge 155
Meg's
it's still only going to take about a
minute and a half to two minutes so
that's how long I have to sit here and
ramble I guess this would be a problem
if you have dial-up then you'd be in for
a real treat I mean and that would take
forever oh it looks like it was just
Shaw's speed boosting I'm not actually
getting 2 megabytes per second but if I
had a better internet connection than I
would because I could go downstairs and
get a drink from the fridge I wouldn't
be all that professional though would it
hmm still contemplating ok maybe I'll
just turn off the camera for now alright
the download is complete so I'll click
run yes ok and whoops
ouch please wait well the files are
saved to your computer when complete the
driver installation will start so you
can read that on your own now because I
zoomed in I have my juice now see
there's my juice my vancouver canucks
mug ok
so click Next for a video setup let's go
ahead and zoom in a little bit so you
read through this in great detail and
then click yes then it installs the
driver software install the drivers
really isn't all that difficult but
where a lot of people run into trouble
is if they're not not super computer
savvy and they're not sure you know who
the manufacturer is for a particular
piece of hardware like say for example
they've got a video card and they know
it's made by MSI but they don't
if it's made by Nvidia ATI the board
partners tend to have the latest drivers
but they don't always have the very
latest and they usually don't have betas
and stuff like that available on their
site so it's always better to go
directly to ATI site for Radeon drivers
and NVIDIA site for GeForce drivers so
why while you're installing a driver at
all well
performance differences and also gives
you a lot more flexibility in
configuring your computer I'm just going
to sort of minimize this it's just going
to keep doing what it's doing and so you
see I'm actually missing the Nvidia
control panel here I have no access to
the Nvidia control panel at all until
I've installed the driver so the Nvidia
control panel gives us all kinds of
different options for stuff that we can
do with our displays things like go
under the desk here things like SLI if
you have two video cards like that
things like configuring physics things
like setting up three displays at a time
so these are all very very important
things yes I want to restart my computer
this is an SSD based system so it should
we start pretty quick here I'm going to
go ahead and get a drink of my juice the
point of this video is just how easy it
is to install your own graphics drivers
I actually have a lot of people comment
on this how my windows is never genuine
and it's always up after the activation
period the reason is that I'm changing
Hardware all the time so when you change
Hardware all the time it's actually very
very obnoxious to reactivate it every
single time you change a video card or
change a CPU or change a motherboard so
I don't bother anymore it is genuine
software but yeah I cannot be bothered
to run the stupid act called Microsoft
every single time I change a single
piece of hardware on the machine it
doesn't make sense so yeah I'm aware of
the little message this copy of Windows
is not genuine I just don't care because
it is genuine I just haven't gotten
around to activating it on my real
machine I believe it's active although
it might not be on that one either ok so
here we go here is all the options we
have in the Nvidia control panel now
that we have our driver installed that
was fairly simple so we can set up
things like stereoscopic 3d because we
do have 3d vision glasses as well as a
an IR transmitter or emitter rather we
can set up 3d settings we can just
enough settings we can change our slide
physics configurations we can change all
this different stuff we can set up
multiple displays that's a pretty cool
feature see we can do all kinds of stuff
so thank you for checking out my how to
install your NVIDIA GeForce drivers and
