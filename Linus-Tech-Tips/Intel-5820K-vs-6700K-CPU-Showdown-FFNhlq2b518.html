us with enthusiasts grade x series
platforms starting with x 58 and since
then rolling out x 79 and x 99 and
although most of you probably know that
these chips that support beefy six and
eight core processors and tons of PCI
Express Lanes what exactly are you
getting in terms of performance by going
for an X chipset and with the price of
ddr4 dropping is it more feasible for
the average PC builder these days also
like the video if you guys are
interested in more show content that's
similar to the style of scrapyard Wars
but isn't necessarily the same thing
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup click now to learn more
today we have a showdown between the
haswell-e
core i7 5820k with six cores and twelve
threads running on an ex ninety-nine
chipset and the new skylake core i7 6700
K with four cores and eight threads
running on a z170 chipset alone 5820k
isn't the most expensive processor
compatible with the x99 chipset we
picked it to see how a processor one
step up from Intel's highest and
mainstream offering would fare in
addition to the extra processing cores
x99 also offers more PCI Express Lanes
in the mainstream options like the Zed
170 chipset you get 20 lanes with the
6700 K about 28 lanes with the 5820k and
the more full-fat x99 cpus namely the 59
30k and the 59 60 X gives you a total of
40 PCIe lanes making x99 an interesting
option if you're planning to run 3 or 4
graphics cards but what about those of
us who don't have just huge stacks of
cash to drop on an SLI or crossfire
setup and it just curious about moving
to higher end chipsets well we checked
prices on Newegg for the entire x99 and
Zed 170 platforms including motherboards
CPUs and ddr4 Ram at the time we shot
this video you could expect to pay about
$30 more for a 5820k than a 6700 K and
about 75 more for an X 99 motherboard
than a Zed 170 so you're looking at
around 100 ish dollar Delta total
average cost for an X 99 platform using
a 5820k comes out to about seven hundred
and forty five dollars
assuming you'll pay around 115 for
sixteen gigabytes of ddr4 ram which has
come down in price quite a bit since its
release one thing to keep in mind is
that although you can use quad channel
RAM on the x99 platform dual channel
will actually work just fine so you
should be able to save a few bucks by
buying just two sticks of memory
if you can live without quad-channel
setup so what exactly do you get for
that extra 100 bucks to find out we ran
a few numbers for both gaming and non
gaming benchmarks on our test bench we
used a pair of a sous motherboards the
x99 deluxe and the z170 deluxe and kept
all other components constant across
both platforms namely 16 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance DDR Ram running at
2,000 133 megahertz a reference nvidia
gtx 980ti and a one terabyte Samsung 850
Pro SSD a corsair h 100 i GTH cpu cooler
and a corsair ax 1200 i power supply we
ran both of our CPUs and graphics cards
at stock speeds jumping right into it we
started out with a couple synthetic
benchmarks to test multi-core
performance although the skylake 6700 K
performed respectively in both
intervention 7-zip the 5820k with its 6
cores outclassed it by a pretty
comfortable margin winning by about 15%
in Cinebench and about 23% in 7-zip are
more single-threaded benchmarks though
told a different story
we use the dolphin benchmark which is
actually part of a Nintendo Wii emulator
but never mind that
we use it to rate race a 3d image here
the skylake processor shows its improved
single core performance as it beats out
the more expensive haswell-e chip by
over 2 minutes we also ran web expert a
benchmark that tests both html5 and
JavaScript performance on the latest
version of google chrome the 6700 K won
again beating out the 5820k by about 19%
in this more single core intensive task
gaming wise we looked at a couple titles
that we knew about from past testing you
can see our course or gaming video up
here we knew that they would benefit
from a higher-end CPU first up we use
City skylines which we ran at 1080p with
everything maxed out here are the 6700 K
won by a full 9 FPS even with its fewer
total cores moving it all over to total
war attila however we also ran at 1080p
with extreme settings but this time
around the 5820k won by a full 5 fps we
also wanted to check out a couple other
popular titles just to see if there was
much of a difference in those graphics
intensive ones namely tomb raider
in crisis 3 a 1080p the settings were
cranked and it was hard to distinguish
these two chips apart although the 5820k
1 by 2 or 3 fps in both cases it wasn't
a difference I'd call significant as
both processors got over 125 fps and
Tomb Raider and around 100 fps in Crysis
3 so what's our conclusion for starters
it's pretty clear that the extra cores
you go with the x99 platform will help
with things like encoding video and
photo editing and other heavy
number-crunching like tasks like say
file compression or data encryption but
gaming results can vary quite a bit
depending on what's in your Steam or
origin library or whatever else and the
four core skylake processors have a bit
of a lead and more common
single-threaded tasks like web browsing
and although you can overclock a 5820k
to match the 4 gigahertz stock speed of
the 6700 k other tests have suggested
that skylake is still superior with
respected instructions per clock or IPC
meaning that the z170 looks like the way
to go for most of you if what you're
going to be doing on your PC is web
browsing and gaming even so thanks in
part to the greater availability of ddr4
memory
it looks more affordable and practical
than ever before to set up an enthusiast
grade platform if you'll be taking
advantage of its extra cores and PCI
Express Lanes
also don't forget that we're seeing
newer features natively supported by the
Zed 170 such as USB 3.1 starting to pop
up on newer x99 boards as well so you
won't necessarily be missing out on
latest gen tech and be left feeling like
the CPUs are always shiny or on the
other side of the proverbial fence if
you're building a mobile app and are
searching for a simple payment solution
you should definitely check out
Braintree they offer code for easy
online payments through their Braintree
