you can see there's fingerprints
handprints and like fake prints all over
the screen disgusting absolutely
disgusting so this is the solution to
your problem your cell phone is a magnet
for dust and gunk I think they also mean
your tablet say for use with Mel cell
phone smartphones eyeglasses cameras
tablets and laptops this is an SMS wipe
which i think is hilarious because for
anyone who doesn't know the reference
Homer Simpson sings a little song that
goes i am support sm marquis and that's
what made me think that this product was
amusing so I had to unbox it so there
you go this is an SMS evite you unfold
it in half and then you can use it to
clean gunk off your tablet so it's got a
little bit of solution on their claims
to be safe safe is good safe is smart
smart to be safe so let's go ahead clean
off our tablet here let's see how clean
we can get it a little bit of solution
helps us get the grease off greasy hands
greasy lips not that you should be
kissing your tablet but you know just
because I say not to do something
doesn't mean somebody won't do it so
there we have it I have wiped off the
tablet now it left some streaks but
that's probably nothing that you
couldn't fix with a shamwow so we'll go
ahead and buff buff that there we go and
now you have a very clean pristine even
tablet surface there's the
reflectiveness test showing there's no
blurriness and then when you turn it on
it will be 0 so vibrant
