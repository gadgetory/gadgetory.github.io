talking about for the last couple weeks
and for a good reason it's in videos
first DirectX 11 part now this isn't
quite the one that people are as excited
about that's the GTX 480 the higher-end
one but today I'm gonna be having a look
at a ZOTAC GTX 470 so this is a slightly
cut-down GTX 480 basically they have
knocked down the memory to twelve
hundred and eighty megabytes and then
they've knocked down the memory
interface to three hundred and twenty
bit so that means that it's slightly
slower access to slightly less memory
and the clock speeds are down a little
bit as well but it's not all bad news
you also save a little bit of money
versus a GTX 480 now something to note
about the zotac gtx 470 is that they've
extended the warranty in the US and
canada they're actually offering a
lifetime warranty on their 470 in 480
parts and they're not the only vendor to
step up and that in that regard with
this generation of cards actually P&amp;amp;Y
did the same thing so here on the side
you can see we've got some I'm gonna
just zoom in here so you can see the Box
a little bit better we have the included
sort of supported software so ZOTAC
boost is tri g-force accelerated
software ok
including badda-boom which is for
encoding video and then be reveal for
enhancing videos and a couple other
things then you've got your usual tags
from Nvidia so with physics as well as
do around the side you've got SLI
support purevideo HD as well as GeForce
Kudo let's go around to the back of the
box where it says this thing goes really
fast and then let's go to the side of
the box where it says sort of more
detailed information so it gives you the
full specs of the card which if i zoom
in just a little tiny bit more you might
actually be able to read there you go
and then it also gives you the system
requirements and key features and the
system requirements aren't here I'm
guessing I'm going around to the other
side of the box for that yeah there we
go
minimum system requirements are right
there so PCI Express 2.0 compliant
motherboard with one duel with 16x
graphics slot in 6 pin and 1/8 pin PCI
Express connector minimum 550 watt or
great
power supply with a minimum 12 volt
current rating of thirty eight amps
okay Pentium it's C this is a weird
thing okay look at this Intel Pentium 4
AMD Athlon XP class processor or higher
show me an Athlon XP motherboard with a
PCI Express slot why even bother putting
that on the side of the box I boggles
the mind okay so why don't we go ahead I
mean everyone does it I'm not just
calling it a zoom tap on this one for
some reason everybody seems to include
that particular requirement Athlon XP or
better so okay I don't have a knife
today but what I do have is an Nvidia
pen to break the seal with so how
appropriate is that I'm just gonna poke
a hole in the tape here wow that's
pretty resilient tape this might be a
bit of a problem it's very strong paint
today but that's okay with the power of
Nvidia I can get through it there we go
and let's find out what is inside this
particular video card box so the first
thing we find is a clear plastic cover
that covers it next we've got a couple
of PCI Express power adapters so that's
a dual molex to single PCI Express and
then another dual molex to single PCI
Express right there and then we've got a
DVI to VGA adapter as well as a mini
HDMI to HDMI adapter next to them to
include that because how many people
have a mini HDMI cable versus how many
people have an HDMI cable okay let's
take out the foam here the foam is
protecting the video card that's kind of
interesting
this doesn't actually look like it's
quite the right size for the 470 look at
this you can kind of take it and stick
it over there and then I'm gonna zoom
out a little bit so you can see what I'm
doing a little bit better here but see
look at look at this you can actually
take the 470 and it looks like it just
just fits right on this side but then on
this side you've got like an extra inch
of space so I'm wondering if maybe this
carton wasn't
for 480 and then they just kind of
slapped for 70 on the outside of it by
the right kid inside this baggie we find
first a warning so the warning is about
just how hot the gtx 470 gets attention
before booting your pc make sure you
connect the two 6-pin PCI Express power
connectors and please allow the graphics
card to cool after operation before
removing it from your system sign in
video thank you for that
next inside here you'll find a few more
things so the first one is supersonic
sled design garage test drive your
GeForce GPU so it's got a couple of demo
demos on there then you have a driver
installation CD as well as a ZOTAC case
pad you don't use that well you can use
the case bag we don't use the CD
download the latest drivers often
video.com uh-huh here's a little list of
these Oh tab boosters well the Nvidia
CUDA enabled applications that you can
run with this card you've got a ZOTAC
extended warranty as well as quick quick
installation guide booklet and then last
but not least you have a ZOTAC user's
manual now let's have a look at the card
itself and this is another thing that
I'm I was pretty sure about but not a
hundred percent yeah on the outside of
the box it this really does look kind of
reused from the 480 which I totally
understand because the reality of it is
they didn't have a whole lot of time to
do packaging between Nvidia sending the
cards to their partners and then putting
branding on them and sending them out
for retail but on the side of this box
it actually says it requires one six pin
and one eight pin PCI Express connector
but this card actually runs off to six
pin connectors so that would be
completely unnecessary so I'm just gonna
stand here and show you the card because
that's simpler than using that stupid
remote to zoom so you've got your fan
here the fan is quite loud if it's
anything like the GTX 480 which I also
did a video about the fan speed of ZOTAC
is actually managed to work their
branding right onto the plastic of the
card itself which is kind of surprising
to me because for the most part all of
the launch cards I've seen have just
kind of had a sticker on them so they've
got their serial number on the top here
or what it may be a part number more
ZOTAC branding geforce branding this
present on all four 70s and four 80s up
at the top you've got two sli bridge
connectors for up to three Way SLI on
the back you can see right where the GPU
is located here where the PCB is busiest
and then right by the fan and videos
actually worked in a ventilation hole
for that fan to get more airflow sucked
in from the back let's work our way down
to the bottom of the car where we will
find a standard PCI Express 16x
connector and then we can go from there
around - I guess the back where you can
see right down into the shroud here
there's some of the power regulation
stuff is right there so you're gonna get
some incidental airflow from the fan
that's going to keep that nice and cool
okay and then around to the business end
of the card this is where your two DVI
connectors are don't forget that these
four 70's and four 80s do support
surround view but only in SLI mode so
you would actually plug two monitors
into two DVI and then you would take
another card and then plug a single
monitor into that and you can actually
run 3d vision on three monitors at the
same time so that's pretty cool
then you've got your mini HDMI connector
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the zotac gtx
470</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
