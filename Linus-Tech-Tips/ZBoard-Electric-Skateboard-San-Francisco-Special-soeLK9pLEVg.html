expensive clothes watches food and the
like doesn't make you cool
you're either cool or you're not but
some cool people also happen to have
lots of the bling bling and if I was one
of those folks this is the kind of
amazingly cool stuff I would spend my
rich people money on welcome to my video
of the Seaboard San Francisco special
their fastest longest range longest
lasting Z board yet with its power loss
protection affordability and performance
the SP 924 may data makes upgrading to
an SSD remarkably safe and simple this
unboxing was actually the most fun I've
had opening a product in a long time it
actually has the strongest new product
smell and I think I've ever encountered
outside of like a car and when I first
discovered it has headlights I was like
oh my god it has headlights I think the
only person who had more fun opening
this product than me is my cat
everything about it is crazy beefy the
International compatible charger has an
integrated cooling fan in the all metal
housing to go along with its LED charge
indicator and the board itself is not
light at 28 pounds the top is a six
layer maple deck with a super grippy
printed surface layer over top embedded
in the deck are the cushioned handle and
the very straightforward control pads
push softly on the front to go slow push
hard to go fast and then push on the
back one to use the board's regenerative
braking or to go backwards a little bit
on the bottom we find the grippy smooth
wheels that can be rotated for more even
wear and then replaced from the spare
parts store which includes most of the
easily worn-out stuff at a reasonable
price the battery and electronics
housing that includes the front and rear
mounted LEDs the charging port and power
switch and finally the motor that powers
the drive wheel overall touching it in
person versus watching videos of it
makes it feel a lot less like a toy and
more like a serious form of
transportation and on that note the
manual is pretty serious business too
you need to sign
waiver to activate your six month
warranty it gives a big ole list of gear
to wear when riding and there's a
detailed pre-flight checklist before
they want you to even turn it on for the
first time but once you do Wow
this thing is amazing some things in
life just put a smile on your face no
matter what kind of a mood you're in and
I've got another entry for the list it
is a little tricky the first time even
after you've memorized the acceleration
stance and braking stance and new riders
will probably find themselves standing a
bit stiffly instead of maintaining a
more relaxed posture but what's great
about this is that because of the way
the controls are set up until you loosen
up and get more confident shifting your
weight around it's actually really hard
to do anything dangerous but this
uncomfortable phase doesn't last for a
long as someone who's only board sport
experiences on a snowboard and who has
never once successfully moved more than
10 feet on a skateboard I really wanted
to review this but I was worried about
even being able to do it not an issue on
my first charge I spent most of my time
figuring out how to loosen up a little
bit I went slowly up and down my street
experimented with leaning to find the
minimum turning radius and that was
about it on my second full battery
charge I was able to move around my
neighborhood on my third ride I was able
to carve a little bit and maintain full
speed on straightaways and then around
my fourth or fifth ride I was able to
carve more comfortably and corner
without using off the accelerator very
fast learning curve and now it's just
way too much fun it's been hard for me
to get off this thing since I started
riding it half of the enjoyment has been
zipping around pushing the limits of the
Z board in new ways so far I've off rode
it on grass for short distances played
around with finding the best ways to go
up and down curbs crossed gravel and
gone way too fast up hills attracting
stares from onlookers and the other half
of the enjoyment is that last thing the
Z board is way too much fun to show off
I don't think I've ever had so many
people stop me to ask me about a new
gadget or do the classic drive past and
stare once you get used to it I wouldn't
call it relaxing to ride you need to be
paying attention but at definite
is it difficult speed control is a
breeze I can match pace with an elderly
couple on the sidewalk or cover the five
kilometers from home to my badminton gym
in less time then Google Maps estimates
for a bike and braking on the rare
occasions that you need to since the
resistance from the drive wheel makes it
pretty hard to get out of control works
surprisingly well whether you're on a
flat or on a fairly steep incline now I
found the rated max speed of 29 km/h
didn't happen often unless I was on a
bit of a downhill slope but on my
fastest kilometer riding around where I
live I averaged 22 kilometres an hour
which considering I was a third of the
way through the battery and in a hilly
area that's pretty damn fast it's not
quite what I expected but I'm still
extremely happy with the experience
which leads us to range this is where
the Z board blew me out of the water I
managed to do 29 kilometres including
stopping starting up and down hills and
lots of general fooling around it's
rated at 32 kilometers on flats and a
mere 20 kilometers in the city not the
case from my experience at all I don't
know what kind of city they were going
around in when they got only 20
kilometers out of it so that was when
the Z board became a much more
justifiable purchase to me dropping this
kind of money on a toy is out of the
question for me if it's an electric
vehicle that can be used as a legitimate
form of transportation that also happens
to be really friggin cool then that's
another ballgame so in conclusion I'd
rather have a hoverboard but if I can't
have that I'll definitely settle for a Z
board I love this thing I'm going to use
it all the time but none of the options
are cheap enough to be impulse buys so
you'll definitely need to think about
whether it makes any sense for you there
are a few things that might help though
so number one is the 30-day return
policy so for a fifty dollar restocking
fee they'll send you a shipping label
back and you can just send you seaboard
back if you're not happy with it for the
rest of your refund number two is how
well they'd supported their products so
far it's easy for these Kickstarter
companies to deliver the first product
to their backers then move on to bigger
and better things and forget about those
guys intuitive motion has provided solid
support in terms of
placement parts and by even managing to
make the original Z board upgradeable to
their new models at prices that I don't
think make their first customers feel
ripped off and then number three is that
they're actually offering Linus tech
tips viewers $100 off any Z board with
offer code Linus full disclosure on the
deal guys I have no advertising
relationship with intuitive motion and I
get no Commission or any other kind of
incentive if you buy one I just think
it's a great product I figured a small
savings might take some of the sting out
so I reached out asking for an offer
code and they sent one so check that out
and that's pretty much it thanks for
watching guys like the video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment and let me know are were
you happy to see us kind of break out of
our usual you know computer hardware or
at least remotely connected consumer
electronics and do something that's
completely different and like outside
under the Sun or would you rather we
just you know stick with computer stuff
I'd love to hear your feedback in the
video description guys you'll find the
usual stuff including the support us
link where you can give us a monthly
contribution if you love our content you
can buy a cool t-shirt like this one and
you can change your amazon bookmark to
one with our affiliate code so we get a
small kickback whenever you buy new
dentures I think people probably don't
buy dentures on Amazon you know I
wouldn't be surprised if amazon has
dentures let's say reading glasses same
thing anyway thanks for watching guys
and as always don't forget to subscribe
