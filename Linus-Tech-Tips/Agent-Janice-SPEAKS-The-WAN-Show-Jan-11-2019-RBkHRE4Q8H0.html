so this is Wow
this is a first also those headphones
are making the sound of my voice so
we're gonna put those away
guess who is co-hosting the when show
today well you don't have to guess who's
right here so we are going to have a
pretty different LAN show today for a
couple of reasons number one is that we
have actually covered the vast majority
of the tech hardware news that has gone
on this week over on tech linked or
online as tech tips or just on you know
Twitter or YouTube stories because
really it's been all about CES but
something that we haven't touched on is
something that you guys have been asking
for a lot and an up it's an update on
secret shopper so as a lot of you will
remember it ended up being an incredibly
popular series for us with each episode
getting well over a million views agent
Janice who is that's okay and you're
gonna have to help the audience out here
is that your real name absolutely are
you actually from accounting yeah it's
not a joke so you do you know that
that's a meme I do what a real Janice
from accounting yes there's the real
Janice from accounting so so Janice for
those of you who didn't see it Secret
shopped six different system integrators
as someone who's not necessarily you
know a hardcore gamer or hardcore tech
enthusiast and honestly got either
treated really well or treated downright
rudely so you guys have kind of asked
for an opportunity to talk to her about
how the whole thing went so we're gonna
talk about that I'm gonna go through
some random floatplane stuff because
Luke's not here to do it and you guys
you know you're not gonna get through an
entire way and show without some flow
playing stuff and then I might actually
bring Dennis on to talk about some
highlights from CES cuz we were down
there together and he's the only other
one who for whatever reason I don't know
why either of us are here
who decided to come in to work today so
let's go ahead and roll the intro and
let's get right into it
all right so so first of all this is
your first time on land show you know
everything is live I'm edited uncensored
so I just want to make sure that I lay
down some ground rules here I need you
to keep your extremely foul potty mouth
off of the land show do you think you
could handle that I'm just giving Janice
a hard time she's like if anything very
very sort of like yeah so first of all I
want you to kind of I want you to kind
of share with the audience what was your
initial thought when you were told okay
you're gonna be are you're gonna be our
secret shopper you're gonna go buy what
was it I think it was thousand-dollar
thousand US dollar right the difference
between our two answers accounting so
fifteen hundred US dollars per system
and you were told okay go buy six gaming
systems yeah I was very intimidated
because I know nothing next to nothing
about computers let alone gaming rigs
and talking on the phone is not my
favorite thing to do so a live show
where you talk about the experience is
even better right absolutely yeah at
least those videos yeah I don't know I I
was willing to help willing to give it a
try I thought it was a cool concept and
the feedback we got actually proved that
more so than I was even a anticipating
so cool
so that honestly is all of that is
actually exactly why we went with Janice
for this project because Janice isn't
stupid she just doesn't know anything
about pcs and I honestly think as people
who are immersed in this tech like
everyday it's so easy to forget that oh
wait hold on a second
so it's so easy for us to forget how
overwhelming all the like speeds and
feeds and spans numbers letters and how
if you're coming in as someone who
actually doesn't have a lot of context
for this stuff honestly in a lot of
cases it's not even as simple as like
well higher number better higher model
number better because you might get told
something like oh okay well this
processor is five gigahertz with six
cores and this one is 4.6 gigahertz with
8 cores and you'd go what would be your
reaction to that exactly and so the the
thing is is that like Ivan and I will
hear something like it's $1,500 and it
comes with a core i3 and maybe like and
that's not funny
that's not funny joke to anyone who
hasn't spent literally years keeping up
with this stuff so that was actually
exactly why we chose Janus for this
because do you feel like you learned a
lot I probably have forgotten some of
this stuff but what that first time I
was ordering the actual computers by the
by the last one I felt like okay I would
know like the very basics of what I'm
actually looking for for a gaming PC
yeah I guess we've got bes n here saying
Janus played her part very well that's
exactly because I have to play a part so
okay now not everything made it into the
finished videos did you end up watching
them by the way yeah you did watch the
finish videos okay was there this is
just before we kind of get into some of
the specific experiences but was there
anything that you felt like the finished
videos didn't capture about your
experience and you can feel free to pick
on individual brands like part of this
whole thing has been about making it a
really open experience for everyone
watching right well to be honest that
was an entire day on the phone and by
the end Ivan would
tell me something about one of the
brands that we had called and I'd be
like which one was that the one with
this or that I had no idea he had it all
in the spreadsheet to keep track but
after you spend an hour plus on the
phone for each brand it's just kind of
blurred together and also I knew I
didn't have to keep track of it so okay
like let that slide
fair enough I mean I guess that's the
only way you can survive spending like
four hours on the bump of tech support
in one day well yeah the other thing
yeah I just I didn't keep track of those
things but the videos certainly didn't
show how tedious right you just be like
I don't know I think it was HP for tech
support
I was just sitting there with like are
they still there I don't know went and
go check my phone 50 minutes later oh
yeah they're still there okay and Dell
okay so we made fun of it a lot in the
videos but the thing with Dell where
they would just stop talking yeah you
don't know if they're checking something
or like how hard is it and the thing
that was craziest about that to me was
because for me I was going okay their
call center could be overseas or there
could be a bad connection or something
there could be some explanation for why
it's taking them a very long time to
reply but then when you were like going
back and forth having a conversation
there didn't appear to be any delay on
the line yeah no there is I think the
only technical problems we had I think
it showed in the first video is one of
the brands couldn't hear me properly but
I'm not even sure I believe that cuz I
just wanted to send an email instead
I've talked to me on the phone okay give
me a give me a highlight for the best
experience that you had in the pre-sales
side do you remember that sort of well
enough the highlight I remember I just
remember being is the end of the day the
last one we called was main gear yeah
and the sales person just went through
everything step by step they had it
visually on their website so I could
like read it as well as hear it I need
to see something in order to remember it
or process it and he was just very
patient and I just remember getting off
that call it wasn't 45 to an hour long
minutes long and it's like oh okay
I'm done and I actually learned
something about computers and I ordered
it and under 15 minutes it was very
relieving so now tell me what was the
worst experience that you had during the
ordering process I know whom I I know
who my pick is but I really would like
you to go first here I think the one
that stands out is cyber power just
because I felt like I was just dismiss
and kind of like well you have to at
least know what you're looking for to
buy something like well that's why I'm
calling asking so not just because we
didn't end up with anything but just
like emotionally it felt like it was
just very dismissive yeah no that was
really rude I actually wasn't gonna pick
them because with cyber power like their
policy is whatever and that's a stupid
policy and that's really rude but the
one that doesn't didn't work out or
something but the one that I really
didn't like though was the way that Dell
kept like not listening to you how many
how many times you thank you
how many times did you tell them you
wanted a desktop and here's the craziest
thing about it like you guys didn't
really get to experience some aspects of
this because you were watching the
heavily edited down version of this like
you guys watched an eighteen or twenty
five minute video or something like that
but Janis is called with Alienware alone
was 45 minutes an hour something like
that so you guys are watching this like
heavily condensed version of it and so
it's hard to get a feel for the time
spans that existed between the events
that took place and the crazy thing
about I'm looking for a gaming desktop
hmm okay so would you like a laptop no
no a desktop
right okay here's the laptop I've
selected for you that whole exchange
happened within a very short span of
time did it not I think so it's just one
part of the conversation so they were
basically just not listening at all and
then and then - like you could go okay
well like that the rep just you know
wasn't paying attention but if I recall
correctly weren't you talking to someone
else when they were when they kept
hearing you say I would not like an
extended warranty and they kept asking
you if you wanted one I think I talked I
don't know how many different people it
was but I got switched back a couple
times about the extended warranty and
then back to the same person or I don't
know who it was but asked multiple
multiple times that yeah that's true
that was frustrating all right so let's
move on to tech support what was your
what was your highlight for tech support
blur together a little bit and also I
was on the first call I was super
nervous because I've never touched the
inside of a computer and so I was just
nervous like I'm gonna be filmed doing
this brand new thing that I don't know
how to do guided by this company that I
don't know that I trust and people are
just gonna watch so well when you put it
that way so highlight for that to be
honest really well besides the end of
the day it's like okay we're done
okay what about a low-light um tech
support so this is when you're trying to
swap the RAM and you get everything from
them having sort of a pre-canned video
to them giving you kind of timestamps to
them having like sort of a really
unprofessional video and then to just
being told if you don't know how to do
it then you should probably get like you
know maybe a man is there a man in the
house to do it for you listen to the
vibe I got from that one but I don't
know maybe you felt really differently
about it
to be honest at the time that one didn't
bother me in the moment really like
looking back on it I realized wow that
was incredibly rude okay in the moment I
was just I don't know I just thought it
was kind of funny probably because I
wasn't an actual customer wanting actual
support right which makes a huge
difference if you're like you're you're
wasting your time you're right you know
trying really hard to get them to help
you right because like in the in the
context of a real world situation you've
probably already burned like an hour or
two hours of your time googling it or or
asking a friend or whatever else so
finally you've given up and you've gone
fine
and they basically tell you go google it
or ask a friend you're like yeah no one
likes an endless loop when they're
trying to get help with something
no and that's I think the other low
light besides realizing how much of a
low light that was I think it's HP at
the that was the last one we called and
it was just like this forever
never-ending loop of transferred or
being on hold for like 15 minutes
well someone goes and researches
something and it was just it took way
too long the craziest thing about that
is that wouldn't have had to take so
long if we had just let them do their
solution so it already would have taken
a long time it would have taken like 45
minutes if we had just let them send you
RAM but then that was such a stupid
solution we kind of wanted to give them
a chance to like they were just gonna
ship you on fire with the other they're
just gonna ship for a stick of RAM
without ever making any attempt to
diagnose that after spending 45 minutes
kicking her between us support Canadian
sales no Canadian support appears to
exist so whenever we tried to get
transferred though that we ended up on
US support again I think we talked to us
sales at some point or another I'm
pretty sure if there are four different
departments I think so
and so we had to kind of like prompt
them well hey you know what if they're
like oh yeah that's pretty common that's
the other thing is okay I got this stick
of RAM in the mail what do I do if I
have to call them again and go through
the whole thing again like I wouldn't
know how to put it in
anyway okay so one of the toughest
questions guys we're gonna we're gonna
queue up a little bit of Q&amp;amp;A here so
floatplane viewers go ahead and drop
that in the chat I'm not sure how long
stuff stays it might kick it away so
maybe don't please try not to spam it
too hard but we want to I want to do a
little bit of Q&amp;amp;A with Janice but first
I just have like kind of a huge question
for you so we're working on a new merch
item what do you think of these boxers
really important question let's see
they're pretty cool have you tried them
10 out of 10 would wear 4 out of 10
personally would not wear I want to know
your opinion I actually I actually quite
I actually quite liked them I think we
might make the the design print it a
little bit bigger like a little more
coarse so that the LT tees are bigger
the lines are bigger and there's fuel
and I think it's a little bit busy right
now
ya wouldn't notice the ltte actually
yeah just at first glance but the - tech
tips on the top is nice yep and so there
you go there you go where uh anyway
that's not actually what I wanted to ask
you yeah I'm just I'm just promoting our
merch no the real thing I wanted to ask
you was knowing this knowing that the
top-performing systems the ones from
iBUYPOWER and the ones from and from HP
so those two were the highest
performance so knowing that they
outperform the main gear by a
significant margin like double digits
they're not twice as fast but I think
they're about 20 to 30 percent faster in
in games okay so knowing that what would
you go back and buy like
honest-to-goodness as as a customer who
cares about the entire experience
because that's the thing as a customer
you will have more than just the
experience of owning the final product
do you do you value do you value those
other things or do you just want the
best thing for your dollar and you
put up with potentially a couple hours
on the phone with tech support to
resolve it hmm so I guess I feel like
vetoing HP just because but like I said
I don't like making phone calls and when
you expect to spend an hour on the phone
every time you have to phone them that
would deter me greatly
however if it's my computer or if I'm
giving it away hold that thought for one
second so it's interesting that you said
that so would you veto HP over Alienware
because Alienware took a long time to
solve your problem but they just took a
long time to solve your problem you
didn't get bounced around the same way
so I think HP only ended up taking about
another 15 minutes so it was like an
hour versus an hour 15 or something like
that don't don't quote me on the exact
numbers but did Alienware stand out in
your mind far less just because you
didn't have this this endless loop of
frustration and transfers apparently
yeah I'm not sure how it all plays into
what I would actually purchase yeah well
why don't we why don't we say this then
so I'll give you two scenarios scenario
number one our our mock sort of premise
is real so scenario number one is you're
buying a system for your brother you're
a super nice sister who has 1500 US
dollars to spend on a brother for some
reason Wow good on you by the way heck
yeah
which one do you buy okay making
decisions with so many things to
consider yeah
okay so first for my brother I would
definitely apparently he's an avid gamer
not for real but we're pretending yeah
sure so I think in the end because it's
a gift I would just like well
I went through the hard stuff for him
now I can give him this really good
computer so I would probably go for like
best bang for your buck really so you'd
go iBUYPOWER because okay the the
research the pre research essentially
that you have to do in order to get the
best thing and the but remembering
though that i buy power i think did
reasonably well on pre-sales and they
only really screwed things up on tech
support so if i'm giving this to my
brother who is an avid gamer you know so
you
I see so you would just go the best
hardware that fits inside the box that
it fits in for the money that you have
and if the RAM is broken or whatever you
just go well you know what I've kind of
done most of my job here here's a free
thing don't complain too hard if you
have to invest a couple hours into
making it work right to be honest I
would give it to him having no idea that
anything was wrong because I would not
think to start up the computer be
fortunate interesting nor would I know
how to check those things Ivan told me
how to check that okay I like that
okay okay so then question number two
now it's for you
actually no no I have a new question
question number two it's for your
parents so they are I'm making
assumptions here I'm making assumptions
forgive me I'm assuming they are less
tech-savvy than you is that fair I would
say nowadays they are my dad used to be
all up on computers in the 90s while ago
he didn't keep up so anyway yes as of
now they would probably greatly value
tech support although my dad hates being
on the phone even more than I do so
let's see
I would swallow the buy like presale
phone support just kind of like hey this
is what I'm doing to get something for
my parents so it come down to tech
support and I guess like
longevity sure just because then I don't
have to do this all kind of thing right
so that doesn't really help because we
tested them they're gaming PCs and
they're yes and we tested them for
gaming so I'm not sure which brand would
be the best for this scenario so I mean
we can kind of draw parallels between in
general we can draw parallels between
the gaming performance of the system and
its performance across a pretty wide
range of tasks actually so you know if
it's 20 to 30 percent faster for gaming
to get the iBUYPOWER or the HP compared
to the main gear then you can kind of
assume it'll be that similar let's just
let's just say that for the sake of
argument okay and is that the same for
like how long something lasts or we will
continue to be faster none of them
really none of them really stood out as
using very shoddy components it's a
little bit complicated so I would say
origin actually probably had I'm just
trying to remember who everyone even was
I think Origen probably had the highest
tier motherboard and power supply which
is generally something that affects the
longevity of a system more than other
things but origins spec was much lower
than both alien wares and main gears so
you kind of had those three performance
tiers you had iBUYPOWER and HP and then
way down from there for gaming anyway
you had your Alienware and your main
gear and then down from there you had
origin okay so taking everything into
consideration I did appreciate
main years tech support as well as
pre-sales and I it did feel like they
just cared enough about you to like not
even have any ounce of like you don't
feel I disqualified because you don't
know much about computers or I don't
know what you're talking about cool so
yeah so probably then and then would you
do the same thing
for yourself or would you have other
considerations I'm just I'm curious
that's my last clip last question for
now I'm just gonna go with probably the
same kind of like a bit of bang for your
buck but I want it to last long and then
not knowing much or since I work here I
would probably rely on some people
around here to help me out with tech
support but if I was completely on my
own
sure tech support would be important for
sure okay so here come the questions
from our floatplane peeps here's here's
one I just this one isn't first but I
just thought this was really good a
question for Janice after this
experience if you had to buy a computer
in real life and let's assume you didn't
work here like just normal
vanilla Janice not lmg equipped Janice
if you had to go buy a computer if you
had to buy a computer in real life would
you shop online again or would you go to
a store oh well as I was saying to eivin
before we started all the first phone
calls yeah I felt really nervous going
in because I when I did buy my laptop in
2008 my previous laptop yeah we've
upgraded her find everyone I did all my
research I actually knew a fair bit
about computers by the time I was
finished like hey what do I need and how
much does it cost for this thing and
like interesting it upgraded whatever as
I as you notice 10 years has done
something to my memory but so I would
yeah personally I would be online odd
research about computers in general and
then I would research about prices and
where to get things and how much
shipping costs included in that because
obviously that's a factor in the final
price if you're having to pay for
shipping as well so I probably wouldn't
call people if I don't have to it'd be
like an online experience got it okay
now that's really interesting because I
didn't even really think to
include as a separate section of this
sort of trying to shop on their sites
before resorting to a phone call as part
of the pre shopping experience is that
something that you did poke around at on
your own but that we just didn't include
in the video or did you have any
thoughts there I didn't have time nor
was allowed to see that before the video
just to make it fair across the board
sure so no that was not part of this
whole experience at all it was just like
make a cold call and ask for a gaming PC
for my brother with a budget so that was
yeah I've done that personally but it
was not part of this experience
interesting all right
see if I can get yeah I've got we've got
a lot of people actually talking about
getting phone anxiety and feeling
exactly the same way as you where they
wouldn't actually leave they wouldn't
actually want to call into anywhere no
in order to buy something I would go
into a store if I had just like a really
confusing question that I couldn't find
out online by myself then I would
probably just go into a store and ask a
salesperson pretend I'm looking at
something to buy oh this is a really
great question from Anthony J Campo over
on Flo plain um okay so after this
experience knowing how difficult it is
because I mean if you were buying a
computer for yourself another sort of
something you brought up is that it
wouldn't necessarily be a gaming
computer right so this this question is
great knowing how difficult it was to
extract useful information from PC
manufacturers be it through their
websites or be it through talking to
them directly on the phone would you
just say you know what forget it I'm
gonna buy Mac an answer honestly like
it's fine no one's gonna judge you
because even whatever you say I kind of
have a spiel that I'm gonna go into here
for a little while anyway so that was
the actual question that was the
question it's just
go and buy Mac would you it okay I'll
read you the exact word okay Janice if
you had to buy a new computer would you
consider buying an Apple product because
of the post purchase support or would
you rather buy a more wallet-friendly
device with equivalent specs that has
worse support and I'm buy support I'm
talking both pre and post-sales because
okay I am kind of a cheap person so I
would probably go with the price the
price point that's my final answer
okay um so the spiel that I was gonna go
into was it's actually a really great
question because a lot of people in our
community sort of marvel that cuz I mean
okay cuz counterpoint to what you just
said you did already acknowledge that
you'd probably go with main gear even
though that wasn't strictly speaking the
best price to performance now Apple does
take that difference to another level in
some cases so so you're willing to
compromise a little but with the
perception then that Apple is a tier
above in terms of the price and then a
tear or two below in terms of the
performance you kind of go oh well
that's my line is that kind of yeah kind
of taking an average of sure but a lot
of people in our community sort of
marvel exactly the same way that Anthony
here did not our Anthony the Anthony who
posed this question marvel that people
buy Apple computers at all don't they
see that it's poor i-5 instead of an i7
price how could they buy that the OS
isn't even that great but the thing to
forget that the thing that people forget
the thing that you have to remember is
that what Apple does so well and you can
you can crap on them for you know it's
all marketing all you want but at the
end of the day marketing is just another
word for communicating proactively with
your potential customers and now if you
think about it that way that is a form
of support
it is a pre-sales support now deceptive
marketing is bad but when Apple says
okay this thing is really light and has
lots of battery life if you carry it and
use it a lot between charges you should
buy it that's not necessarily deceptive
now they're not saying well okay in some
cases they do make performance claims
that I kind of go really you guys but
you know they're not saying that this
thing is gonna edit 8k video or whatever
like they're not getting specific like
that so there are many cases where Apple
does market their products in a way that
I wouldn't consider deceptive and so I
guess I'm just trying to point out that
that is something that is an actual
value to an Apple product now for my for
my own part I don't buy a lot of Apple
products because I don't need someone to
hold my hand and make a flashy
commercial about like that that sort of
shows the kinds of users and the kinds
of lifestyles that people have who
should you know want this product that
doesn't mean anything to me like I
actually do want to know the specs and
then I want to know the price and the
pros and cons and all that nitty-gritty
stuff but that's basically your answer
is in just the same way that Janus was
like yeah I'd probably go main here
knowing that there's that there's this I
mean would you say there's a certain
degree of trust yeah trusting that
you're gonna get good information on the
front end and that you're gonna get good
help on the back end yeah I'm willing to
compromise some raw performance in order
to sort of have that that certain degree
of trust and even though Apple has made
a ton of mistakes over the years the
reality of it is that many of their
customers don't keep the products long
enough to experience these kinds of
longer-term failures or they just simply
aren't affected by them in the way that
power users who make a lot of noise
online are so Apple still manages to
hold on to this high degree of trust
with its users and it's something that I
think a lot of people find baffling but
here we are so I just I thought that was
a really interesting question let me
have a look here
okay okay actually there's yeah there's
not that many uh there's not that many
questions here so that's pretty cool I
can actually have a look and see if
anyone left a super chat as well uh okay
there's a bunch of stuff here are you an
Android or iOS user and why I think I
know the answer to this but go ahead -
knows because I am an Android user only
because the phone came from LNG well not
only because but that is why I am right
now we'll go with that
I don't think were you wanting iPhone
before no I've never owned a an iPod
Touch many moons ago
that's my only awful product so so so
full context here Janis only has a
modern smartphone because back when she
was still doing babysitting for us her
Christmas bonus was a new phone because
I couldn't watch her use the things she
had I was just like this is terrible
this is like small though I'll give it
that
okay all right that's wonderful solid
solid benefit I think oh wow there's
actually a lot more um okay actually one
last question for you and then I'll
probably have Dennis come in and talk
about some of the stuff we saw at CES
this is from re SC wood agent Janice
ever consider going undercover in person
how's your in-person anxiety compared to
your phone anxiety like running around
and like secret shopping best buy memory
express what are your thoughts hmm I
would say okay I have two points one is
that sometimes in person is easier than
the phone as far as like anxiety and
that kind of stuff goes really it's a
little less unknown you can read someone
you can not kind of thing interesting
that's that okay so that's kind of
leaning towards in person but the other
part was that Ivan was actually
with me on the calls or in the same room
while I was calling and to kind of
navigate some of this stuff and provide
reactions that was very helpful there
are a few times where I just be like
what do I need to do right now what if
we just had like like actually like
agent Janice like the little squiggly
thing behind the ear and you had like
the earpiece and just put your hair down
you know but that probably make me
nervous because I'd be like they can see
what I'm doing
whereas the phone would obviously hide
more so I don't know pros and cons and
remember with the phone when because the
thing about in-person is that and this
this is I'll speak to my own experience
first and you can tell me if you feel
the same way but in person I find one of
the most difficult things about it is
that it tends to be a really high
pressure sales scenario because everyone
knows if you're in sales you've been
trained on this I guarantee it
everyone knows that once the customer
walks out the door your chances of
making the sale drop precipitously like
when they're still in the door and
you're still having a conversation you
are deep into double digits chance of
making a sale when they walk out the
door it falls too low single digits if
it's even all the way to one percent
when someone leaves you're basically
done because they're going to walk into
the door somewhere else and that person
will be a better sales rep than you
apparently and will not let them out the
door without setting you up with the
right deal so knowing that you would
have to like decline people in person
potentially I mean I guess you're buying
a system every time if I do that's fine
so anyway then okay so it's like a lot
less pressure however if I was shopping
personally for my own computer or
whatever device that I don't know
anything about then yes there'd be a lot
more pressure and I don't know yeah in
some ways the phone you can hide behind
it and in other ways it it's still kind
of a anxiety-producing type of thing
yeah I get more anxiety in person and
over the
for sure but I mean it's all down to
down to the individual which is why you
know we actually had a lot of people
comment on the videos I saw a handful of
these where people were like why are you
calling them anyway who does that and
but that's the thing it's like that's
why company not everyone's the same as
you sorry
and that's that's why companies are
supposed to have chat email phone
possibilities because that's how you
provide a good customer experience you
have to you have to allow for someone to
prefer talking on the phone to someone
like I actually strongly prefer when I
especially when I really don't
understand something very well I
strongly prefer to talk to someone on
the phone because then I get a chance to
explain what it is that I want rather
than just hoping that the information is
there and available for me to glean from
their website or whatever the case may
be also when you talk on the phone or
when you talk in person there is the
potential to negotiate a zone okay I
think that's pretty much it there's one
last question here that they just they
just added Casey asks would you ever be
on camera again I am right now okay I
guess what I guess what okay I'm gonna
put my own spin on the question then
would you consider doing a secret
shopper again uh yeah I just don't know
what it would be for because agent
Janice her cover's blown yeah I guess
that's uh that's kind of a fair point
actually isn't it
although I guess that kind of goes I
don't like Best Buy and places like that
Oh Matthew Swanger says Janice was
awesome on the series sent five dollars
and said this is for her not you so
there you go thanks Matthew
thanks by the way that's not the way
super chats normally work I just thought
it was really funny that it was
specifically not for me
you guys don't send super chats that are
like this is for Dennis this is for Nick
and this is for Luke we move know that
we don't audit them that way but but
they he go Matt Matt Matthew hooked you
up so get a coffee and thank you very
much I know that this is not necessarily
your comfort zone
really appreciate it honestly I felt
like what we what we did as a team and
you were an integral part of it was a
huge community service for the gaming
community not necessarily the technology
community as much because I think those
guys and gals are like comfortable just
ordering parts off Newegg and assembling
it themselves for the most part but for
the people who aren't happy doing that
yeah our audience is the techy people
but they don't want to build everyone in
their families computers so this way
they can have the confidence to
recommend and experience that those
people are gonna be happy with in the
longer term I actually have no idea how
oh no I'm not letting you go yet right I
had a whole other thing I wanted to talk
to you about so I actually have no idea
how sorry how this has affected the
sales of those companies but I do know
that policies are already changing so
for one thing
I spoke with Dell back at CES or not
back at all I was literally midnight
yeah so I actually spoke with Dell two
days ago and they said they have already
made changes to their policies based on
watching these videos these videos are
now mandatory viewing for all of their
support centers which is Wow
pretty cool you actually made a
difference so one of the biggest
problems they said was that instead of
talking to their gaming team because we
were in Canada you were forwarded to
like a generic sales team that doesn't
know anything specialized especially
about the gaming hardware and so that
doesn't excuse how bad their script was
to be very clear delay lien weird people
who are watching this show but that was
a difference that was made there how did
you feel about the responses that you
got from the companies you heard from
that was the last thing I wanted to ask
you okay funny story so I actually I got
the email from a personal email from I
bye
power apologizing for the technical
support experience that I received and
assuring me that you know things were
gonna change and thanks for the feedback
kind of thing at the time I had not
watched that video yet and so I was a
little bit confused because I thought he
was referring to the first video
experience which was not that I actually
rewashed it and thought I don't know
what he's talking about anyway all that
aside so that was a personal email i
received from high power they also
publicly acknowledge that they screwed
up they were they were like sitting
there on their f5 buttons like waiting
for that video to drop on youtube so
they could have the first comment on it
saying like okay we done goofed like
we're working on this sorry Dennis so I
thought that was a really that was a
really cool way that they owned it yeah
I don't believe we've gotten any
response from HP whatsoever so I haven't
heard anything their main gear put out a
press release I have basically stroking
their own stroking their own egos Oh
main gear you're so great I love myself
so much right now so I mean in fairness
to them they actually did to me well
they did do a pretty good job they
declared victory in their press release
if I recall correctly so they said
despite the conclusion that we came to
despite the conclusion we came to where
we said well we did say it's a gaming
computer but then they were like well
they also record and Verizon was good
for CPU encoding so okay you can kind of
you can slice that pie either way I'm
just trying to think who else who else
was involved I don't know if CyberPower
responded at all about their completing
up yeah maybe I haven't received as many
responses about it as I thought so you
had your Dell who did respond well to
you and they actually yeah that's
interesting too so Dell reached out to
me partway through the series but
specifically said I'm not gonna say
anything because I don't want to affect
the rest of the outcome and it wouldn't
have anyway
but you know thank you we are watching
this
very closely HP didn't say anything and
then we had main gear and who was our
other boutique origin yet I don't think
we heard from I think we really heard
from origin about although they did want
to meet with me at CES and I really
wanted to meet with the CEO and I
unfortunately wasn't able to make it
over there so I guess we don't have
their response but that's because I
wasn't able to get there okay so yeah I
just wanted to kind of get your thoughts
on do you feel better now that iBUYPOWER
apologized or well you forgive them
forgive them took me a while but no it
wasn't as I was saying to Linus I did
this for this purpose it wasn't like I
was actually purchasing the computer and
so right some some parts I just kind of
laughed it off it I didn't feel
personally attacked or anything right
yes looking back to the video yeah
that's not a way to treat a customer so
well so it's not a way to treat anybody
sure you know person yeah that's true
okay all right so I'll stop lying to you
about actually being allowed to go now
really though thank you for coming on I
just I felt like this was such a cool
and important thing we did and I'd love
to do more of it agent Genesis cover is
kind of blown because I'm pretty sure
she is mega famous now within the system
integrator space because don't kid
yourself
main gear origin ibuypower cyber power
HP and delay Lee and where are not the
only ones who are aware of this series I
had more than one system builder kind of
go and not because they don't like try
to do a very good job but just because
the thing with a secret shopper setup is
one bad rep can make your whole company
look really bad so it's it's a it's a
high risk reward and remember we were
down in Vegas everybody's gambling but
that is a well high risk reward kind of
proposition there um do you mind
grabbing Dennis on your way on your way
over here and don't don't forget your
five bucks from Matt yeah Matthew
swagger this is look this is like
this was awesome on the series this is
for her not you - all caps you'll just
drop it anyways so there you go alright
and we don't normally do that but Janice
deserves if nothing else like a coffee
break on account of what she went
through for that thing yeah she was
awesome Ivan was awesome Pella deserves
mad props because those videos were not
easy to edit you know taking three hours
of like phone calls like he probably had
to sit on the phone longer than Janice
did that's oh that's actually an
interesting way of thinking about it all
right while I'm waiting for Dennis and
we'll talk about some CES recap stuff
and we'll go ahead and Dennis why would
you run right in front of the camera
dude
you're killing me here I was gonna do
sponsors before you got here there was
no there's no particular hurry house

energy so yes so no more walking running

it's like okay why are you even at work
today cuz I'm editing I have one more

points that I have to go through for
them get PIAA it's a good VPN it's
affordable and it helps support Linus
tech tips alright just we've we're like
really late in the show to do sponsors
so I want to I want to get through these
and I want to save oh man I have a very
tricky yeah so yeah you get the ghost
pepper you ready wait wait wait wait oh
it's my crown my waters this is really
hot I try to savage turkey their goal is
to make a delicious snack without
nitrates or preservatives that's full of
flavor but not bad for you and they
don't just sell jerky oh man my mouths
watering they've got hot sauces like the
Moho jalapeno right there they've got
spice rubs so this sauce here contains a
blend of jalapeno garlic lime and
cilantro
oh that provides an amazing zip at the
right amount of heat do you may deep
this man I was barky no no no most
people do not dip their jerky and hot
sauce no the jerky is an independent
product oh okay hold on hold on wait
wait wait wait for wait wait to eat that
this is this is the hottest one with it
goes no that's not the hottest one I
believe the Carolina Reaper is the
hottest one I remember when I was dying
last time I can't promise
Caterpie again but wait I don't deep on
you okay I haven't actually tried this
one before oh that's actually really
nice okay I have a little bit yeah what
what I want to try it why would you do
that why would you dip jerky and hot
sauce yeah go ahead but like that's
stupid
who does that
that's like freak show it's why you know
why did that insult go away that used to
be an insult your freak show maybe it's
not really correct I don't know anyway
check out savage jerky use offer code
LTZ to save 10% and savage jerky calm ah
they've got something for everyone
squid oh we got a new ship in a maple
buffalo bacon I am so happy right now
Oh
this isn't this is not as hot as the one
I tried last time no pepper one is
really hot it takes a little while to
kick in there all right let's talk see
yes what was your highlight from the
show to be honest this year is kinda
like a blur to me I have been just
walking around we haven't like to find
stuff but I found there a lot of like
affordable displays everywhere mm-hmm I
saw a display photo book purse that was
cool yeah so like we tweeted about it
earlier this week but like the top of
the purse had a curved display so you
could like you could open it and close
it right and what was I in touch it
what we're going on the display it's
just some text and some text I think
like they'll be cool you could come
change the texture of your purse or you
can put on your phone info so do you
like foldable displays as like a fashion
accessory yeah if you could wear a
bracelet that's like like not just you
know like I'll cuz obviously the idea of
decorating yourself with like glowing
stuff is not you know I like those ones
like you know they use those paper
what's that called like pink pink
yeah that kind of material no look cool
cuz it's not like too shiny but would
you like like the next level where it's
actually brightened like high resolution
like a screen yeah yeah but I don't wear
anything don't laugh you know be cool
okay cool oh like glasses if or the size
like that you can change different
things I could have given him the maple
buffalo bacon
can I have one maple you can you
probably won't even be able to like
taste it though oh this is good
this is a to spicing about that was
really good so okay what did you think
of the foldable TV or the rolling
rollerball TV I didn't actually get to
stop there to see Bob did you watch the
video but I saw you pull some stuff I
didn't see it well dang it Dennis all
right tell you what this is pretty cool
alright I'm which video all right the
one where it rolls up so I'm just gonna
yeah I know that I have didn't bring it
up alright how does the rollable TV work
try let's play it okay so this is one of
our this is one of our videos from the
show here there's our epic chilling 4d
brand all right oh so here's how it
works so you got this like speaker base
here
okay and it's about kind of yay big bye
yay big so maybe like a foot by a foot
maybe a little more maybe like 18 inches
16 inches something along those lines so
you press one button and boom it opens
up at the back and the screen just
raises out of it how thin this this mmm
I don't know like less than a centimeter
for sure like it's quite thin this is it
like wobbly or is nope
so there's these two arms at the back
that kind of like come down like this
and like they support it at the back
okay now I had I saw one viewer mention
that there was a little bit of like kind
of rip leanness to the screen honestly
seeing it in person I think the camera
picks that up more than your eyes do to
me from anything but a very X in
anything but a very extreme situation
where I have like a hard light and I'm
looking directly at the angle of
incidence I think it's called I don't
remember anyway the angle of reflection
like if I'm looking directly out of hard
light using the the TV as a mirror it's
noticeable but in person looking at
actual content it is not know
they say it'll do it 50,000 times up and
down oh but it's only 65 inches and if
previous pricing of Signature Series
models is anything to go on
I would expect it to cost anywhere in
the neighborhood of 15 to $15,000 you
that's OLED right you betcha
there I felt this oh I think that's like
it just says this the one we saw in in
Korea right one of those yeah yeah oh
that's really cool so that was one of
the big highlights for me I just okay
this is the every year I see it's that
computer stuff yeah you know those
things that you step on it and those
thing that yeah thing just move along
like a pad thing yeah every year it's
just there and like a bunch of people
I'm not to try that okay what okay okay
why don't we talk about some of the
other seemingly off-topic stuff Joris
how many massage chairs there I know and
that's all good thing I was going to say
that there's so many so many of them who
is buying these my parent they did they
buy one 20 years okay your parents also
owned this weird leg okay yes they they
body like 25 years ago and never use it
it's just like a giant garbage they're
sitting there it's just so big and you
don't really sit on that thing but the
one I saw it a CSI cement bigger but it
looks really comfy but I kind of I want
to try it but I wouldn't buy it
remember I did try and compute X the
foot massage one mm-hmm it was so tight
it's like freaking my my legs but but I
don't know it's like everywhere what did
you think of the AI laptop demo um cuz
you edited that one right I did showed
off they've partnered with Microsoft and
they're using a zero
like like as your cloud AI
something-or-other and the idea is that
they've got a laptop that uses AI
technology to intelligently manage its
power distribution between the CPU and
the GPU in order to optimize certain
workloads and they claim that they can
get measurable performance gains out of
it but when we went to the booth their
demo was awful so their gaming demo had
to video playback
side by side with an FPS counter on it
instead of actually having the game
running and I asked why and they said oh
well it's because the RT X performance
embargo hasn't lifted yet ok fine
and then on the other side they had
Adobe Premiere cs5 yeah I don't yeah
that's like the first day I saw they
used a really OH premiere version do you
know why I think they used it why I bet
it's pirated I bet the demo team just
didn't have a CC license but why cs5 I
have a pirated copy of cs6 at the very
least I'm pretty sure it's still on the
server somewhere like to be clear we pay
for Adobe Premiere a lot of money to
Adobe but like I will confess that in
our very early days when we had no money
we had a pirated copy of cs6 I never use
it well no I don't think I don't think
you'd ever used it
we were Creative Cloud by the time you
do yeah yeah we always have the latest
version no but yeah I don't know I don't
get it yeah and they stand for the demo
we finish the rendering I think that one
without a I finished earlier like like a
fraction of a second or something like
like everything marginally and like to
be clear this was like a five or ten
minute render or something like that
wasn't it
uh I don't really remember have to see
that rice was it was a little bit I
don't know they asked me to come back
and run it again
and I was like guys I'm like I've moved
on I've moved the world has moved on but
they are so confident that their AI
technology is gonna work and I'm like
I'm like I'm kind of baffled here I
don't really understand how like the
cloud is gonna
help with power state switching on micro
processors which happens on like a
microsecond scale like I don't really
understand how it's gonna help with that
but they insist that their AI tech a eye
technology works and we're gonna do a
review of that laptop it's the arrow 15
and we're gonna see how that goes
stay tuned for the video we go through
the arrow 15 in a little bit more detail
so funny so the fact that the computer
fell apart when I picked it up that is
not staged that was it which is nice
guru yeah oh it just it was just on the
show floor just sitting there with no
screws in it whatsoever and it just I
picked it up and it just came apart and
I checked the other ones and they were
all fine they were all put together it
just happened to be that the one that I
had them unlock so I could hold it up
while I was talking about it just
completely fell apart in my hands oh
that's hilarious so yeah maybe they just
they're damn or just not not good okay I
want to go through one more thing that I
thought was really cool okay so OLED
you've seen OLED screens before oh yeah
yay or nay the darkness like the truth
dark and like it's really thin yeah okay
what if I said that you can have the
benefits of LCD so that's very high
brightness but you can get very near to
the true darkness and then OLED has with
an LCD yeah did I lunchtime
oh okay well then I guess I imagine I
haven't told you that before I'm gonna
talk to the viewers okay okay so okay
would you think that there's a way for
LCD to achieve that level of darkness
without compromising its brightness
because that's the problem for LCD all
you have to do to get brighter is crank
the back leg yeah but then your blacks
become Gray's anything it doesn't look
good now you can turn the backlight way
down but then let's do white is great
yeah there's really no way around it
unfortunately
and there's there's mitigation
strategies so you can have TVs that have
zones that can be individually
brightened or dimmed so if you have like
a highly reflective white spacecraft
flying by on this side and then you've
got you know like the the pitch
blackness of space behind it over here
though these zones can be brighter and
these zones can be darker but you get
this ugly like stare Casey looking in
some cases like halo effect around the
bright objects because those zones are
square okay and there's nothing that you
can really do to make them perfectly
aligned with the shape of the object
because they're just sort of modules of
LEDs at the back that can be
individually adjusted all right so
Hisense do you ever have you ever heard
of hi-c and the funny thing about
Hisense is for so many years every year
I've gone to CES every year they've had
the booth right across from Intel and
I've always been like who exactly are
these guys why are they right across
from into the giant booth like primo
space so we're talking center hall right
at the entrance you got Intel Hisense
walk writing like what what even are
these guys doing here
because their booth was just always
maybe I missed a couple things here and
there but I didn't think so their booth
seemed to be always kind of dead with
them like trying kind of desperation
tactics to get people to come in and
look at it like having a little like
like shouders be like oh come in and see
Hisense and then like very mediocre
displays like super mediocre like a gen
or two behind or like showing the latest
cool thing like 4k like it looked bad
you know so so high sense of all people
and I thought well maybe they're just
like huge in like Asia or something but
like none of your friends had a high
sense TV like I probably I need to know
what that was calling Chinese oh okay
well we can probably do that I'm sure I
say this from China right
I believe so they apparently have a u.s.
site
um Hisense here we go their native name
no I don't know never heard of that no
so they've been up they were founded in
1969 like they're a 50 year old company
15 billion dollars of revenue in 2013 so
they probably grown since then they're
also an OEM so they sell to other
manufacturers
oh they have several brand names
combined Keylong
Ron Shen does that sound familiar no no
okay so anyway I'm just like who are
these guys um but James said okay Linus
you got to go look at this they've got
an LCD that achieves near-perfect black
without that halo effect of a full array
local dimming backlight and so what
they've done is basically they've got a
normal backlight yeah
fullback Lane then they've taken two LCD
modules and they were very clear that it
is two modules not two panels because if
you put two panels together you end up
with all kinds of weird artifacting in
fact I remember using a display that had
two LCD panels one on top of the other
one probably around eight or nine years
ago it was from a company called Oh what
were they called ah stereo 3d monitor it
was it so anyway the idea was that it
was for man stereo display I feel like
it had like an accident or something
like that yeah it was a stereo display
and so they were polarized vertically
and horizontally and then you wore
polarized glasses so it was passive
instead of using active shutter glasses
like invidious tech and it was supposed
to be for gaming but it like barely
worked and that thing looked like
garbage when you weren't looking at 3d
content actually kind of looked like
garbage when you were looking at 3d
content anyway they said that having two
panels next to each other would
introduce all kinds of visual anomalies
and I believed them but
having two modules and sharing some of
the components that would make up a full
panel assembly between them things like
light filters or polarization filters
they could work with so what they've
done is they've taken a full backlight
we're gonna have a video on this that's
quite a bit more detailed as part of our
CES coverage that's gonna roll out over
the rest of tonight and then I believe
tomorrow and then regularly scheduled
content is coming back on and I believe
Sunday but they've got this light and
they've taken a first panel and it's
grayscale so it's black and white
well not black and white because that
wouldn't work very well but grayscale so
you actually see an image of the of the
of like there demo has like a soccer
player have you seen the demo no okay
unfortunately it's in YouTube stories
that I did the thing and there's
absolutely no way to access stories I
just like I don't get the whole like the
whole thing you know how Instagram it's
like you can't post from not your phone
or at least for a long time no couldn't
and for a long time you couldn't even
like browse it from not your phone like
it would just tell you to load it up and
mobile that was a long time ago but I
just hate I just hate like intentionally
locking things down so oh okay yeah so
that's normal multi zone and then this
is what high sense is doing oh you can
actually make out so the first clip was
the IOC the regular display regular like
multi zone backlighting okay that was
like local dimming change oh sorry so
that's that's the first that's local
dimming so you see there's not much
granularity to it and then when we move
over to the other side this is what high
sense is doing so this is an LCD panel
with a backlight behind it that is
grayscale so what happens is you've got
bright Werther's yeah are the images
bright yeah and then you've got dark
where it's dark but there's still quite
a lot of bleed from those bright areas
to the dark areas but get this in front
of that module is an additional module
that is 4k color so what happens is in
those areas in those halos around here
the first one is letting light through
you get to apply on
another darkening layer on it that
second module can go full black as well
so you have you end up with knocking
those bleeding your your your blocking
out the bleeding with an additional
layer so you end up with a multiplier
effect so the way that it stacks
together is if you could block out one
thousandth let's say that's like a
typical contrast native contrast ratio
at least a couple years ago so if you
could block one thousandth of the light
that comes through or sorry ninety nine
thousandths if it was one thousandth the
level yeah then instead of it being half
of one thousandth for having two you can
block ninety nine thousand again so you
end up with like point zero zero zero
three nits of brightness on the black
like I took my hands and I cup them on
the screen and like tried to see the
backlight through it and it was really
impressive really cool and no one else
is showing anything like this and the
whole thing is being in my opinion
grossly under reported like I haven't
seen any major publications like like
beating the drum about this because it's
really cool and so there's a cost
benefit to because instead of using
expensive OLED panels it uses two
cheaper LCD modules yeah to make a
single panel and it's very mature
technology the hard part was the
algorithmic splitting of the incoming
image into monochrome or excuse me
grayscale and full color and then
recombining it together but maintaining
the color tonality which I mean I've
only seen demo content on it so far but
it looked pretty darn good how thick is
the display ah you know what I didn't
even think to check I mean tell me this
okay you've asked me this now twice why
do you care how thick a TV is I don't
know like cuz I don't I in the living
room you don't - like a toothache TV I
don't know for me like thickness is
really important for me and one one
other reason is like to show off I cares
I cares about the thickness of the TV
okay
like you don't care about thickness I
mean it's easy for me to say cuz I have
like a w7m yeah but like before that no
my TV at home right now is like this
thick yeah it's probably cuz you didn't
steal one from the office yet not yet
but yeah I bought this like use use
second hand sake yeah I don't 55-inch
I think it's LCD as well I don't
remember it probably really old probably
yes
alright well I think that's pretty much
it for Montreux today we've actually
kind of run over time so thank you
Dennis Thank You Janice ended up lasting
a lot longer than I thought and thanks
to you guys for watching we will see you
again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel oh wait
hold on I haven't done any Super chats
Mikkel says how hey Linus
I just want to say your coffee came in
yesterday I might do a video of me
drinking it and to let you know how it
tastes I have to find a small grinder
somewhere other than that I managed to
get two gtx 1080 eyes for 550 bucks
how's that for a price that's actually
really good
that's awesome elliot any micro LED TVs
demoed at CES actually there were micro
LED demos but I didn't end up getting a
close look at any of them so I'll have
to get back to you on that one
Harris says Linus you don't understand
machine learning a zero slash AWS uses
tons of data to make predictions the
vendor probably didn't have large data
set to Train right but how do you make a
prediction about like the GPU rendering
frames in pub G I just yeah I'm ready to
be proven wrong but they're saying that
it's to its power allocation but the
issue that I have with this is that a
well-designed laptop already like today
doesn't power throttle when gaming so if
we're not throttling if everything's
going full full couch as Jake would say
then why do we need
ái power distribution and reallocation
so I mean hey I'm ready to be wrong here
but their demo didn't work either
so I also have the only evidence that I
have yet to observe with my own eyes
backing me up on this but we shall see
Kyle says did you get the gift my fiance
sent you you bought your sandals needed
extra style you got a new one doing
Christmas new socks you are you can get
a new you said no I'm assuming it's the
like the unicorn socks that arrived
today I was kind of wondering what was
up with that
Robert Ron says there's no wrong way to
eat hot sauce no yes there is the way
don't know no you put you put hustla and
the thing alder mir says just received
my first addition to LTT cable ties on
the East Coast whoo happy to hear that
oh yeah I guess I should probably uh
should probably like pimp the store oh I
also count to see the unboxer can I see
that oh yeah and oh yeah Luke is hiring
so I have a couple of details about that
as well so guys check out the store it's
actually doing really well I'm kind of
impressed
so there's cable ties there's a couple
shirt designs we're gonna have new shirt
designs hopefully fairly soon and then
the stuff that like the reason we have a
full time person because I'm sure anyone
looking at sort of like nine months of
work and going okay so you've got what
like two new shirt designs and like a
velcro tie would probably go that person
really doesn't do a lot do they but no
we're actually hard at work on much more
custom stuff because honestly for my own
part I'm really not as into the stuff
that like anyone can do like shirts are
great and people love wearing shirts and
like you know repping us and helping
support us and all that stuff but I want
to also do highly customized stuff like
what we did with the land hoodie but
like more modern design obviously like
we're not just gonna reprint when hoodie
and like stuff that's really good like
this this bus is really the nice
material yeah you're we're not cheaping
out on any more is
I got I got two and really nice yeah
yeah
so I was I mean I guess I don't really
talked about this on LAN show I'm gonna
do Luke's thing first and then I can
kind of talk about why we revamped the
why we revamped the the merge store so
Luke is hiring I'm gonna link this in
the chat here over on YouTube because
that's where the vast majority of you
are watching there we go oh we had a big
drop-off UPS right bang keyboard we had
a big drop-off when I said this show was
over and then now it's like picking up
again because people realize that I'm
not actually done so we're hiring we're
searching for a developer that has a
strong aptitudes that has strong
aptitudes in linux our hell experience
with orchestration tools like ansible
chef puppet team for excuse me terraform
sorry this text is really small
terraform hubert at ease and has an
understanding of virtualization and
networking I put a link in the video
description actually there's a link in
the description as well on all platforms
as far as I know there's a blurb there
I'll be posting the in for position and
with more okay we're also reposting our
infrastructure position with more
clarification of what we're looking for
and also just a reminder about the
migration if you are still paying for
flow plane through the LTTE forum that
is not going to be a thing anymore
check out the sticky on the forum for
details on how to move over to flow
plane calm we know flow plane comm
doesn't really have a homepage chill
we're working on it but the the payment
system works ok so now we can go through
the merch store so basically the idea
was that we were selling shirts that
were like printed to order so they were
like direct-to-garment printing and i
just really wasn't happy people would
walk up to me at a show and I would like
part of me was like I know that they
bought this to like support us at least
partially but like I look at the quality
of the printing on it and I'd be really
unhappy because I want everyone who buys
stuff from us to feel like they got her
they had a really great experience and I
want like anything with our brand on it
to be really nice and what kept
happening was we would get with
merge companies and initially the
quality would be great and then it
wouldn't be until some of our samples
are all great and then it wouldn't be
until I run into someone at a trade show
and you'd be like okay it might be a
ripoff one there actually can buy ripoff
filters yeah somewhere stupid anyway it
might be a ripoff but I know there were
at least a couple of them that were real
and we're just a representative of the
degrading quality of both we've seen
shirts swapped on us
after the fact we've seen printing
processes swapped on us after the fact I
just wasn't happy with it
so we've taken complete control back
in-house of all of our March and so
we're only using American Apparel shirts
we're only using a nice high quality
printing process so you can see like
this shirt is really vibrant that's
that's all we'll accept now this is
probably not gonna be quite so vibrant
because this sample has a white inside
which we realized is probably not a
great idea for underwear so we're gonna
do a black inside and then we're gonna
do a screen printed thing on it but
we're working on water bottles we're
working on some really cool custom
hoodies we did we pulled a couple of the
designs in the past and people seemed
pretty amped on them and the boxers so
these so right so not cheeping out on
materials these use this like for sport
like exercising no they just kind of
feel like it because this material is
like super like it's kind of stretchy
and it's super soft I forget what it's
called Lloyd would be able to tell me
but like what do you think it's really
nice like I liked it I think this is
like for if you go exercising will be no
those eyelet they not just like cotton
cotton ones this is more stretchy and
more air can go through this yeah I
forget I think I forget what the
materials cost no tag it's a sample yeah
this is just like a pre-production
sample of it the stitching looks nice
like you know I think this is the third
company that we've had samples arrived
from but yeah we've got a lot more work
to do
Oh madad o that's what the material is
called Oh who's watching Nick
yeah huh so yeah we were did we just
want to we want to like take it up to a
completely new level and the stuffs not
gonna be super cheap and we are still
it's gonna take a long time for us to
figure out International shipping
because we're sort of new at this being
an e Taylor thing but stay tuned guys
because we've been hard at work on a lot
of iterations of things in order to
finally reach final product stage and we
want everything that we sell through the
store from now on to be really really
good so that's at you guys
we will see you again for real this time
next week same bat-time same bat-channel
they're still watching you what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
