mouse are designed to provide
best-in-class features and performance
for gaming click now to learn more when
it comes to cpu liquid coolers it's not
exactly rocket surgery it's mostly a
function of how good are the fans and
how much surface area can you throw at
it I mean there can be other factors for
example with Corsairs h100 i there's
excellent software integration with
their course or link software for things
like monitoring liquid temperature
monitoring fan rpm CPU temperature fan
control all that kind of cool stuff but
those things tend to add cost to the
unit and tend not to necessarily
contribute to raw performance the H 105
goes to the H 110 school of product
design which is a little bit more
bare-bones in terms of extra stuff but
definitely targeting performance so
unlike the H 100 I the H 105 features a
thicker radiator and unlike the H 110
which features a thin radiator but with
140 millimeter fans the H 105 features
120 millimeter fans on its red so it
should sit somewhere in between those
two in terms of performance but if I had
to hazard a guess I would say
particularly at lower rpms it's probably
going to be closer to the H 110 because
of the design of the radiator with a
little bit lower fin density than I'm
used to seeing with these all-in-one
units which i think is actually probably
a good thing because as soon as you
throw dual 120 millimeter fans at
cooling a single CPU even if it's quite
a powerful one unless you're talking
about extreme overclocking it's pretty
much enough so you might as well go
after silence and speaking of silence
the two included fans are PWM so this is
a bit of a nice touch here and they can
operate from anywhere from 800 rpm to
2700 rpm so 800 rpm is going to be very
very quiet on a 38 millimeter thick
radiator like this one that's compared
to 25 millimeters which is more the more
typical thin thin radiator setup like
what you'll find on an H 100 I and then
all the way up to 2700 rpm which for me
would be uncomfortably loud and I
probably
didn't recommend that so much now the
included fans aside from being PWM and
being good in that way are pretty basic
these are SP 120 L fans unlike the
regular SP 120 s which are available in
a quiet addition and performance Edition
the mean the main differences there
being that the regular sp1 20s have
swappable color rings as well as rubber
isolating grommets in the corners and
just generally feel a little bit nicer
overall in terms of build quality now if
you did decide that you weren't going to
use the L Series fans and you were going
to upgrade to SPS there's another little
cool thing so Corsair has changed the
design of the block and pump combo unit
here they've add they've changed the ID
and they've added a little swappable
ring so it comes with the same colors as
you can get an AF and SP series fans
you've got blue and red but
unfortunately not white so there's a
gray one on there by default they've
also updated the mounting hardware just
a touch so it comes with the Intel
hold-down pre-installed now it comes
with a slightly updated back plate this
is an ASA tech design so it's not really
something we've never seen before but
the little pieces are a little bit
easier to slide so whether you're
mounting on LGA 1150 X 1366 or 2011
you're going to be able to get it in the
right position quite easily although
remember guys 2011 does have its own
backplate built onto the motherboard
just like AMD sockets so same thing for
the AMD Hardware you're just going to
get a hold down which can be swapped by
just undoing these four little clips
right here popping off the bottom ring
just like that pulling off the retention
or pulling off the hold down and then
swapping on the appropriate AMD one so
you can do that relatively easily and
then it will just screw directly into
the back plate that is built into your
motherboard giving you compatibility for
FM sockets as well as a.m. sockets the
last thing they've updated in terms of
the ID is they have changed the thumb
screws a little bit and then other than
that I think that's pretty much it for
accessories you also get a PWM Y cable
so this will allow you to plug both of
the fans into your CPU fan header so you
can actually control both of them with
PWM using a single fan header so that's
actually really handy that from what
I've seen the best way to do PWM control
because the CPU fan header tends to be
the least broken of all the PWM
implementations on a on a given
motherboard
or in a given system it uses quarter
inch tubing but I'm not really convinced
that that's going to be a problem for it
because these all-in-one liquid coolers
don't tend to to have extremely high
flow rates to the point where 3/8 or
even 1/2 inch tubing would make much of
a difference and other than that it's
going to come down to the radiator right
here so 38 millimeters thick as I
mentioned before a little bit lower fin
density that we've necessarily seen in
the past and and the fan belt the
thickness well okay I've talked a lot
about the thicknesses because that's the
main difference here it's going to
affect performance and it's also going
to affect compatibility so you're going
to want to make sure that if you plan to
install the h 105 in your case you have
enough clearance not only for a 25
millimeter thick fan but also a 38
millimeter thick radiator comes with all
the mounting hardware that you'll need
to mount the fans on either side mount
the radiator directly to the case and
then the fans to that or mount the
radiator through the fan to the case
from the top or whatever else
you need to do you just need to make
sure you have enough room which leads us
to performance off to Luke 4 that all
right so to start us off there's been a
test bench change now we are running in
x79 deluxe from a soos and a 48 20 K
from Intel this was because in the
previous set up I was noticing some
pretty major inconsistencies when trying
to test the h 105 from Corsair and it
wasn't testing the same every run and it
was kind of all over the place with
massive Delta's so I thought there might
be something wrong swapped out hardware
and now we're getting much more
consistent numbers this was isolated to
just this test so it must have been
recently and I don't think it's going to
affect other videos that we've recorded
to don't worry about that as for
installing it it was much better than H
110 which has the kind of older
installation setup but it wasn't quite
as good as an H 100 I which has the
super nice magnetic locking plates and
all that kind of stuff that Corsair is
put on it but it was definitely in the
higher echelon of installation processes
for coolers that I have used and it
performed pretty much exactly where we
expected it performed in between an H
100 I and an H 110 now what I want in
the future as all of those things are
fairly self-explanatory you guys
probably heard that from Linus
previously because he expected it and it
was true what what I want to see in the
future is I want them all to come
together
like essentially in h1 15i
or an H I or something I don't really
know but I want them all to come
together I want the the size of the h1
10 I want the thickness of the H 105 and
I want the advanced technologies in
connectivity and mounting system of an H
100 I what do you guys want what are you
looking for in a cooler even looking for
an AI o or you more focus still on air
let me know in the comments below like
and favorite the video depending on
whether you run air or water and as
always subscribe to Linus tech tips
