guess completely a spoiler of an
upcoming episode of NCIS tech tips where
I'm going to take a much closer look at
the Corsair f60 this is from their
fourth series of SSDs that means it
features the San force controller which
is the latest and greatest controller on
the market I did do an unboxing of this
particular drive so you can see the
accessories that comes with including a
two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half inch
adapter but anyway the angle I'm taking
on this particular episode is going to
be what if you were an early adopter for
SSD so I found the oldest SSD Drive I
could find in this case it was a some
crucial 64 gig drive this is back before
there were even like series names like
force so this is just called 64 gig SSD
Drive here's the part number here this
was really the oldest thing I could find
and I want to find out because I've
compared the San force controller I've
compared a modern SSD to a hard drive
before but I've never compared it to an
old SSD so what if you were one of the
people who bought one of these for seven
hundred and fifty dollars back when they
were current and the the hottest new
thing is it worth it to upgrade already
because a 4 series drive is only two
hundred dollars for almost the same
capacity and as we will see and I'm
going to totally ruin the surprise here
so there's the 4 series drive it's two
hundred dollars at the moment on NCIX as
we will see from the benchmark results
that I obtained with it if you were
using an old drive so here let's find
the crucial old SSD you can see that it
scores only 1147 points on the hard
drive test so this Drive just trying to
benchmark it was painful it actually
took about 30 seconds longer to boot up
the OS compared to the 4 series drive so
it took about if i recall i wrote this
down at work but it took about a minute
and 25 seconds to boot up whereas the 4
series SSD was around the 52nd mark ok
and just trying to use the system was
painful everything took so long
especially when I was multitasking
because like many old SSDs this Drive
suffers from a bit of a stuttering issue
so if you're using multiple applications
at the same time what will happen is as
the drive tries to access data that's
and I'm being very figurative here here
and here at the same time the controller
gets confused it doesn't know what to do
and it actually can take longer than a
hard drive to access those two bits of
data even though a hard drive actually
has physical moving parts inside that
need to seek and find the data on a
physical hard disk platter so that was
one of the challenges with early SSDs
with the San force that problem is
completely solved along with offering
much better speeds on sequential reads
and writes as well so here are the
scores let's do a couple quick
comparison so the ones that are most
relevant this is a kind of an antivirus
security software test so you can see
that it comes in at 10 megabytes per
second so let's compare that to the 4
series SSD where you can see that we are
actually getting 22 thousand marks in
the hard drive suite on pcmark vantage
and then here in the Windows Defender
test we are seeing a 10x improvement at
120 megabytes per second when we're
using like a system utility type program
now gaming it did a little bit better
now gaming it would do well because
sequential reads are something that old
SSDs were reasonably good at where it's
just taking one big long file and
reading the whole thing start to finish
so even then even in the one that it did
I think best in yeah best in the San
force SSD just smokes it now random
stuff where you're accessing little bits
of data all over the drive that's where
the newer SSDs really shine you compare
that to the numbers that we saw on the
old crucial SSD and everything is as
much as as much as all 50 times faster
on a newer SSD compared to an older one
so there you have it we have seen that
if you were an early adopter basically
it's from a capacity standpoint not
really but from a performance standpoint
it's getting to be time to go ahead and
replace that SSD already thank you for
