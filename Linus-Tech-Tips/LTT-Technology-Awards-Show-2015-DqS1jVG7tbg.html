Linus tech tips technology Awards I'm
your host Linus tech - it's actually my
last name Sebastian don't worry too much
about that so we're gonna keep the show
pretty simple today and we're gonna be
talking about some of the top and some
of the well less top products of 2015
that we have had our hands on so stay
tuned because it's gonna be one heck of
a ride
just like that one night when I wrote a
camera
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology and RGB
lighting check out the link in the video
description to learn more our first
award of the night is the snake-oil
award for being the biggest pile of
snake oil and it's the pono player from
Neil Young yes the pono player brought
to us a $400 mp3 player that was going
to redefine the way we listen to music
along with a music store full of
high-quality music that turned out to
make no difference whatsoever in a blind
a bee trial thanking pono player for
giving us a product that has so much
snake oil which is a liquid that we
actually managed to make a pile of the
snake oil our next award is the
reinvention of the wheel award for
reinventing a product that no one really
asked to be reinvented and this one goes
to valve for the steam controller the
steam controller adds touch pads to the
handheld controller experience which is
not great for some gaming genres but
makes it possible to play mouse and
keyboard interaction games like
civilization or papers please on the
couch on the big screen in a way that
wasn't possible before our next award is
the square wheel made of cheese award
for reinventing a product that no one
asked to be reinventing and it not
ending up being particularly good and
its valve again this time with steam
machines the PC slash console things
that cost as much as a PC - a Windows
license but don't have all of the
benefits of a PC like all that game
compatibility and actually don't even
have a lot of the benefits of a console
like exclusive titles or Netflix apps or
really anything else and might improve
later but
for now our taking home this award in
2015 our best smartphone of 2015 award
goes to wow I don't think anyone's gonna
see this one coming
the iPhone 6s now to be clear the iPhone
6s did not win a place in my pocket as
my daily driver
but best is such a funny word and what
Apple did this year was drove forward
the industry in terms of smartphone
performance both in terms of the actual
CPU and in terms of the rest of the
subsystem with faster storage and faster
Wi-Fi by a longshot than anyone else is
delivering and I personally think 3d
touch is going to be a huge thing for
smartphones in 2016 and beyond so we got
to give kudos where kudos is due which
leads us to the biggest disappointment
award and while I can't necessarily
claim to have been that disappointed by
the products because I really didn't
have high hopes for it from the
beginning this one goes to the Apple
watch everything the Apple watch wants
to be is great phone extension that you
can have on your wrist so you can
actually carry conversations with the
speaker and microphone the gorgeous
multicolored screen that apps and all
that stuff all let down by an SOC and
battery that only allow it to be on for
a few hours a day and make you rely on
goofy gestures in order to turn it on
when you want to use it the shark in the
toilet award for being the biggest
surprise of the year goes to the google
onhub which we actually expected to be a
total turd I mean who wants a router
with only one Ethernet port on it that's
ridiculous right
but the Wi-Fi range and performance of
the tp-link variant of the google onhub
absolutely blew us away in our review
and I think it's a great option for
people who really don't need to rely on
a wired can
affection or who are willing to add a
breakout switch to their wireless router
that is to say as long as they don't
mind Google being the gateway to their
internet connection the coolest
manufacturer swag award was no contest
at all and it goes to LG for the 3d
printed figurine of me and then a later
one with socks and sandals for accuracy
as well as the gigantic box of socks
that go with those sandals that we
unboxed in front of a crowd here at our
Meetup thanks LG for really thinking
outside the box in terms of swag items
the rebadge award we've actually got two
winners for this one it goes to j-bird
and to AMD for rebadging the j-bird blew
buds X as the x2 with a slightly
different carrying case and package and
AMD for well rebadging most of their
video cards this year although the most
notable one is probably the 390 series
the 390 and the 390x the best monitor EV
our award for being the best monitor EV
r was a pretty difficult one as it's one
that we awarded multiple times this year
just be the best I've ever seen my
cardigan Editors Choice Award the only
choice for K it's off my wishlist my new
top choice top dog gaming monitor but of
course we're gonna go with the most
recent tow winners the Acer predator X
34 with its 34 inches of ultra wide 100
Hertz this and the asus rog swift PG 2 7
9 q which operates on a stunning 165
Hertz refresh rate at 1440p with both of
them featuring Nvidia g-sync
technology which leads us to our final
award
the award for the best fans and that one
it should come as no surprise goes to me
elaborating with Noctua to create the n
ff12 and NF a 14 l TT edition fans now
I'm just kidding it's you guys thank you
so much for this absolutely awesome year
thank you for coming along with us for
the ride as we explored all these
products did a bunch of crazy projects I
mean can you believe that whole room
water cooling wrapped up this year
scrapyard wars started this year we did
to gamers one CPU this year
Luke's epic fallout 4 build all that
happened this year at least I hope it
happened this year this entire - media
group thing has sort of been a blur but
thank you guys all for being part of it
all 2.1 million or so of you and we hope
that 2016 is going to be just as fun and
exciting
and speaking of award shows the award
for the the desk that goes the most up
and down with electronic control
allowing you to sit or stand or adjust
to any height you could possibly want
goes to up desk these guys kitted out
our entire office here almost for Nick
and Colton don't have up desks but what
are you gonna do they equipped our
entire office with their fantastic power
up up desks allowing us to set three
different presets a low a high and then
a somewhere in the middle I guess if
you're one of those people who kind of
like crouches in an action stance while
you work at your keyboard and mouse
there are extremely high quality they're
nice and quiet as they raise and lower
and they come in a wide variety of
configurations Luke and John are
actually equipped with their squared up
desks these are corner desks that have
the same height adjust features they've
got a bunch of different tabletops and
if you guys want to check it out and get
yourself a standing slash sitting desk
we've got a link in the video
description and while there's been a lot
of study on the benefits of standing
versus sitting the thing we can all
agree on is that moving around is good
although there seems to be some evidence
that just standing all day is not really
that great even compared to just sitting
all day
what's cool about the up desk is thanks
to its design it can actually be
equipped with a treadmill underneath so
if you want to really take your game to
the next level you get a treadmill going
and you can actually work and walk at
the same time pretty great stuff so
