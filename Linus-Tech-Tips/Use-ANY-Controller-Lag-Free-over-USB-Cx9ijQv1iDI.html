growing out you got this great idea yeah
you know what man we should play some
retro games because the emulation isn't
dying because of Nintendo lawsuits
anyway fortunately you're a well
equipped retro gamer you've got all
kinds of controllers for all kinds of
amazing retro consoles and 64 SNES
original nests yes
Coleco Wow but there's only one problem
even though you've got your emulation PC
all set up and you got your retro art oh
can you turn this oh wow this is
terrible everything is terrible you're
gonna have to come around
you got your retro arch all set up with
all your games and everything then
you're like huh how do i plug how do i
plug one of these into one of these if
only there was a solution oh there it is
and we're gonna tell you about it after
this word from our sponsor Mac Weldon
Mac Weldon makes great underwear
t-shirts socks wallets and more they
believe in simple shopping if you use
code tech tips you will get 20% off your
next purchase so go check them out at
the link below
so this right here is the bliss box in
the box you get the Bliss box adapter
which has got one USB B so a USB to be
at the back then it's got four HDMI
connectors now here's a funny thing that
a lot of people don't know there is a
huge difference between physical
connection standards and electrical
connection standards and while you might
see an HDMI port that's totally normal
HDMI port and go okay so that's a touch
for video right you might not always be
correct and I have seen HDMI used for
all kinds of things I've even seen it
used for PCI Express that was pretty
weird in this case all they needed was
some kind of cheap standard connector
that they could get that had enough pins
for everything they could possibly want
to connect to it and can you walk us
through what are all these some of them
are fairly recognizable I don't know if
they're all labeled that's nice this is
nice this is nes this looks like
gamecube is the Coleco they ship you the
bliss box and then this entire bouquet
of adapters so that you could have four
controllers for pretty much any retro
console you would want and you don't
have to go with even the slightly
different experience that you might get
with something like an 8-bit dough
controller wait this for me oh wow this
is from us Ness MIDI yeah oh so this is
first party yeah alright then does this
have an adapter to know oh that was
insane we did not think of that
so in terms of setup honestly there's
not a whole lot you got to configure
these dip switches to determine whether
you want for play mode or single play
mode and then it doesn't require
external power you just go ahead and pop
that USB in the back it supports a
hundred plus types of controllers so
everything we've got here I mean with
the exception maybe this is pretty
mainstream from a retro gaming
perspective and it even supports
advanced functionality like
pressure-sensitive buttons on ps2
controllers in games that support that
and it has the ability to detect what
kind of controller is in what type of
ports so your emulator just with a
restart at worst should be able
pick up exactly what all the button
bindings are without any dinking around
whatsoever
the last major benefit of this aside
from that it's just a single cable
solution instead of having a bunch of
dongles hanging out of the front of your
case is that it is extremely low latency
so the idea and we went and obtained
this mammoth of a TV specifically so
that we could evaluate that for
ourselves the idea is that you should
have a and as good as original latency
gaming experience but I'm not sure if I
buy it yet you see one thing we missed
apparently you need to reset the bliss
box when you change the controller's
around I think there was a button here
so then every one of them has a button
right beside it yet oh well we don't
have it plugged in at all dang it
when you're trying to reset it and stuff
it should say some like kind of yellowy
text to the bottom of the emulator that
isn't showing up maybe not
plugged in there we go wait what hold on
I'm just doing mine too is yours working
it was working for like a second and
then I touched it
okay so we had some problems and we have
react lived I went home I got mice nests
controllers like oh geez nest
controllers and my ps2 dual shocks also
we figured out what was going on with
Luke's PlayStation controller it's mad
catz there's also like a fray on the
case there's some detection issues there
the n64 controllers turns out that was a
retro art issue and then finally the
Coleco it looks like these are very
simple devices there's nothing to really
detect but there's a manual override so
we're just gonna just gonna try again
can we just play some chess games
because like the whole thing is it's
supposed to be really low latency like
there's some there's some part of the
USB standard that it's using that mostly
gets ignored that's supposed to allow it
to the interrupt-driven
yeah it's so theoretically it's like the
best thing ever okay so can we just do
Super Mario World yes absolutely okay
because within a very short period of
time I should be able to tell I'm like
game jam you you probably have more
experience here than me but I've also
played this game a bunch you calling me
old
no it's a classic you just were you know
part of it when it first came out that's
all I kind of zoned out just watching
what's going on Oh why'd I do that
dang it points for you stupid that's
feeling good trying real hard right now
SNES tomorrowworld I'm impressed
works good versus zero issues from my
stance alright okay you pick the game
this time you pick the game pick a game
where you know how to play it and I
don't see I'm not this old we're gonna
do this one you hyped me up on this okay
we can play another Lynas game I'm gonna
be cool I'm gonna be hairy okay good
flatland is like pretty into flames have
to do flatland
which one even am i I'm up here what the
heck okay I don't remember any of the
control okay I don't even know what just
happened there I think having the AI is
in here might have been a mistake
okay what the heck dude we was at you
yeah there you go
that's right now you know what's up wait
oh boy oh I just picked up a heart I to
think and I think I picked up a heart
awesome and through a log at me he logs
loser oh crap I just got bombed I'm in
danger
whoa he's got the bomb no so anyway this
should probably move on but that's
actually kinda the game that I used to
play I miss games like that
yeah that are just like you can kind of
figure it out kinda right away stupid
dumb fun yeah yeah okay that's cool I
like that so no problem with controllers
yeah everything seemed to work fine yep
feeling good yeah GameCube controllers
are apparently later a thing now yeah
okay yeah thank you I heard it sorry
which I don't care yeah let's do cleric
oh geez
what a guy I'm funny to me see yeah
whatever I had the crappy analog stick
which actually is making more of a
difference than it was previously
so I've been playing this game with the
classic controller on the Wii and I
thought I sucked at this game but
actually I don't that controller just is
not actually very good so wait because
I'm perfectly good at the game down 64
control you have right now is better
than the classroom oh so much but I mean
part of it too though again is muscle
memory like there's no way I would have
been able to overtake that truck on the
classic controller there we go
come on baby show me that first place
I'm like hopefully I actually hated this
controller really I did not realize I
just didn't like how asymmetrical they
were like it's a weird ergonomic
situation here for me are you ready to
play some burger time no I want to watch
you play first
oh I think I'm dead now though yeah so I
put one okay so you have to step on
something to make it fall go go go
you're in okay
this seems like the place where I have
the most options there on you though I
know I just I want them all behind me
okay we get to see what this is yeah it
is it's free life that's awesome
yeah that's right good very good run
very good run okay I think we can make
it what what so I think really we can
draw our conclusion right yeah if the
objective of the foreplay from bliss box
is low-latency
multi controller support then I think
there are a lot of the way there there's
still some software niggles that a lot
of them are as much to do with
third-party software as they are to do
with blitz boxes implementation but it
does mean that the user experience with
what with the resetting controllers and
restarting your software every time is
not amazing yeah and there's the cost
issue it is not cheap at fifty five
bucks for the box and then seven dollars
each for the adaptors especially when
you compare it to something like this
that costs anywhere from fifteen to
twenty-five bucks for a couple
controllers I mean seven times two is a
lot of that cost
but the latency and the ability to have
this sitting on your desk and hot-swap
controllers as much as you want even
though you still have to have a lot of
dongle sitting in this drawer somewhere
so I think they're on a good path the
retro gaming experience aside from our
choice of titles actually a lot of fun
so I mean Burger Time is pretty mean
we're giving it a conditional thumbs up
yeah conditional thumbs up still some
work to do on the software and the ease
of use and luckily all the problems can
be software or firmware updated but
controller support was actually pretty
darn good across the board for us
Dreamcast's apparently which is pretty
cool yeah ting ting is the mobile
carrier that makes sense it's the mobile
carrier that lets you call them and talk
to an actual person which I mean who
could imagine that in this day and age
you taught me to talk to customer
service you actually call him someone
pick something just like Hello what can
I do for you and you don't even pay
extra for the privilege with ting you
pay only for the data and the talk time
that you use and the average ting bill
is just 23 bucks a month per device
furthermore if you switch to ting
they'll cover 25% of your cancellation
fee from your existing contract up to
$75 and this is great if you check out
their savings calculator which we're
gonna have linked below and you would
save money on ting if you use our link
so that's Linus 2018 ting comm you will
get 25 bucks in service credit or
towards a new device so don't wait go
check them out today so thanks for
watching guys if you just like this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff we featuring at the link in
the video description also down there is
our merch store which has cool shirts
like this one yeah you like this one and
our community forum forum which you
should definitely doing implement and
floatplane
you should join that too and you should
probably get a clear vision controllers
you can play Bert you should probably
not do that at all I am not endorsing
