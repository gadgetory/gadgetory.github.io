and 7 plus burst onto the scene
completely devoid of non-proprietary
ports with only a single lightning
connector that is to say the parts of
the world who have completely ignored
anything that Apple's done in the last
couple of years they were shocked anyway
I've spent my usual few weeks with the
latest i shiny and I am ready to talk
about the experience
intel skull canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 quad-core processor
and Thunderbolt 3 learn more at the link
in the video description the iPhone 6s
won my 2015 phone of the Year award for
its shocking performance and it would
appear as though the iPhone 7 is gunning
for the same prize it rocks apples
stunning a10 fusion a quad core design
that borrows at least conceptually from
the big little chips that have been
commonplace on Android phones for years
in both Qualcomm Snapdragon and
Samsung's Exynos processors it features
two high-performance cores about 40%
faster than the a9 if Apple's to be
believed and too low performance course
that consumed only about a fifth of the
power of the hyper funds and it seems to
be working wonderfully the iPhone 7
installs apps as quickly as I can
download the last one and managed with
only a moderately larger 1960 milliamp
hour battery to completely address my
ongoing complaint about Apple's devices
that they have wonderful standby power
then they drain so fast you can watch
your battery bar burn if you have the
audacity to use GPS to go any further
than the corner store as for the rest of
the specs there's more good news
iPhone users finally get more RAM at
three gigs if they get the bigger 7 plus
the earphone speaker doubles as a
serviceable stereo speaker now yay Apple
used the headphone jack space to add a
barometer which is neat I guess and you
can get up to 256 gigs now of
regrettably non expandable storage with
the 16 gig model having finally been
axed to make way for 32 gigs on the base
model of the traditional colors or 64
gigs on the new jet black color which I
guess is a clever scheme to raise a SP s
by convincing status seekers to buy a
higher tier than the base if they want
their friends to even be able to tell
that they have the new one since the 7
looks
externally so similar to its predecessor
on the subject of other things similar
the screen hasn't changed much either
wide color gamut is a welcomed and
forward-looking upgrade but Apple has
stuck with 1080p on the iPhone 7 plus
and 750 P on its little brother but I
support this and even though they put
the lock and volume directly opposing
each other which is a frequent gripe of
mine they got the tactile feel perfect I
almost never accidentally pressed one
while reaching for the other some of the
other physical changes though I'm a
little more hesitant to endorse let's do
the solid state home button first I
really like this move it feels as clicky
or subtle as you want and like the 2015
MacBook
I often forgot that it didn't move it
will only wear out if the upgraded
taptic engine inside the phone dies and
it improves the sevens resistance to
water and dust the only thing missing
here is a software update to allow its
pressure sensor to operate without skin
to button contact I haven't needed
gloves yet this year but as we Canadian
say winter is coming next up is the ip67
water and dust resistance I'm surprised
this took so long given that water and
falls account for 95% of iPhone deaths
but I absolutely love this move and
customer happiness aside more alive
iPhones is great for Apple's trade-in
program and refurbished device business
selling a product for a margin even a
little bit of margin a second time is
just plain good business leading us to
number three the removal of the
headphone jack I said in my Odyssey sine
review which you can check out here that
if they removed it I better be getting
something significant in return and
honestly especially with the
waterproofing
I think they pulled it off and besides
what I've discovered from talking to
other seven and seven plus owners and
trying to keep my own mind open
is that even my general objection to
carrying around a stupid adapter put me
in a smaller minority of general
consumers than I previously thought I
think my badminton buddy Jason put it
best when I asked him about it I haven't
really noticed I used my Jaybirds for
everything anyway
great wireless bluetooth headphones like
Sennheiser's pxc 550 s are everywhere
and a little retention doodad like
motorola includes what the Droid Z would
easily address the issue of losing the
included adapter for audiophile IEMs
which won't go wireless any time soon
meaning that my only real remaining
issue is charging and listening to
podcasts while I sleep at the same time
a $15.00 problem or 25 if I want one
that also adds volume and track control
onto the camera it's simply put amazing
and I even spent most of my time with
the single sensor 7 as opposed to the
dual sensor plus it doesn't have boodles
of more megapixel or whatever but apples
color science and auto white balance
deliver a much more true-to-life image
on full auto than I thought was possible
and through third-party apps you can
capture raw photos which is almost like
an extra bonus at that point low-light
performance is on point the selfie cam
was upgraded and even the app launch
time is amongst the best that I've seen
though auto wake screen and swipe to the
side is still a touch slower than a
gesture or a physical button that I can
press without looking at the device in
some situations with that said I have
much bigger complaints about iOS 10
software wise there is some good stuff
I'm not sure exactly when it happened
but Apple naps has a great UI now Siri
still works better for me than okay
Google I don't use a ton of widgets but
it's swell to have the option and force
touch continues to improve with
notification interactions combined with
being able to respond within the
notification itself being my favorite
use for it but there are also some
glaring omissions and some Polish
deficiency
dictating while writing an email allows
the cursor to scroll under where the
keyboard would be making it impossible
to see what you're saying I still find
the swipe back gesture very inconsistent
one-handed operation in general feels
bolted on and clunky rather than like a
fundamental part of iOS design I'm
baffled that the Google now clone today
view thing on the left of the homescreen
doesn't have a working back button when
you click on a suggested article I don't
get the organization of the Settings
menu
sometimes the dial pad and phone
controls still aren't on the same screen
adding unnecessary button presses I
really missed Samsung's excellent
magical white pages powered span and
caller ID database I hate how I still
can't control the cursor precisely on
first touch if I have steady hands
please let me turn off the auto guidance
here androids management of multiple
volume sliders is much better since it
actually allows ringtone to be adjusted
while listening to music for example and
finally and perhaps most importantly
where the is t9 dialing Apple some of us
know a lot of people and this is an
unassailably better way to call
infrequently used contacts that doesn't
interfere with any of the other ways
that people can also use it just add it
but this is the company that took years
to add copy-paste so a bottom line time
the iPhone 7 is not a revolutionary
product and I could go on for a while
longer with all of my complaints about
its accompanying operating system but
I'm sure we're all bored of that but
what it is is a continuation of Apple's
onward march towards hardware perfection
and the a10 processor at its heart gives
a lot of credibility to the analysts who
believe that Apple will eventually
replace the Intel processors in their
thin and light designs with their own
but that's besides the point do I
recommend the iPhone 7 and the 7 plus
well as long as you have big enough
hands for the plus and as long as you
don't mind making a pile of useless apps
to reach the ones that you care about
then yeah I guess I do D brand is your
source for the wicked vinyl skins you
saw on our iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus in
fact the marbled one on the iPhone 7
managed to sell one of my friends on a D
brand skin pretty much immediately
that's one of their newer Styles they've
got a wide variety of different colors
of a genuine 3m vinyl skins and they all
feature unrivaled precision thanks to
the way they are cut their configurator
is great too because it allows you to
view and pick out exactly what you want
for your device and preview what it's
going to look like in your hand whether
you want something tasteful or whether
you want something totally gaudy and
tacky you will know exactly what's going
to arrive and there's no excuses which
isn't to say though that their customer
service robots aren't great and easy to
deal with if you ever do have a problem
D brand skins are affordable they're
available for a wide variety of devices
including phones tablets laptops game
consoles and game controllers and they
ship worldwide at the link in the video
