2017 to prove once and for all that
Rison is real it is physical it is
tangible you can touch it well you can't
touch it but but but I could touch it
because I'm here if I as long as I
didn't care about like ESD shocking it
because these floors are carpeted not
only do they have the couple of systems
that I'm going to show you here but they
actually have systems from over a dozen
of their partners everyone from PC case
gear to what the devil is this thing
whatever it is it's water cool that's
red it looks actually pretty freaking
bananas and the logos in Chinese so I'm
not going to try too hard to pronounce
that one anyway let's get let's get back
over here to the demos here the systems
in front of me right now
are the ones from the AMD livestream
about a month ago not they're they
they're not rebuilt the same spec they
are the exact systems because that demo
raised a lot of questions jool did AMD
change this did they change that of what
clock speeds is it running at so we have
the answers to a significant chunk of
that speculation right now so this one
right here is running an 8 core 16
thread they let me take the panels off
eight core 16 thread rise in CPU on a
validation level motherboard so this is
like a reference design you can actually
buy this board
they've got dual channel ddr3 in here
they're running a Titan XP because AMD
are a bunch of smart folks they know
that our X 480 is not going to prove
that this CPU can run with the biggest
fastest GPU on the market today they had
to put that in there it is what it is
but the point is it's the real deal now
we have a look at this guy
AMD claimed they had a sixty nine
hundred K $1000 processor from Intel
running on legit actual production
hardware oh look that's what it is so
the demo that we're looking at right now
is battlefield one running on a 69
hundred K with a Titan XP otherwise the
same hardware yes the case is different
that does not really affect the
performance very much if
that's an advantage for the Intel system
because thanks to GPU boost that card
will run a little faster if it's cool
better and right here we have it
frame rate counter battlefield one in
one of the early training missions they
are running damn near identically which
is pretty unbelievable and AMD hasn't
even showed all their cards yet because
their chip is running at 3.4 gigahertz
without their precision boost dynamic
clock speed adjustments going at all yet
dun dun da demo number 2 also highly
controversial because people were
looking at it going well how can this a
core versus that 8 core have so
significant difference in the stream
quality and the answer from AMD and I
mean I'm standing here with me in the
webcam after stream delay I'm standing
here seeing the demo the answer from
them is that it's their infinity fabric
that allows the individual processing
course to talk to each other more
efficiently that allows the game to be
played here and the stream to be
processed on the cpu for the broadcast
much more efficiently now the obvious
question is why aren't you just using
quick sync or n B &amp;amp; C like a fixed
function h.264 encoder and there are two
answers to that so number one the quick
sink doesn't exist on Intel's Broadwell
processors they're their high-end and
number two is that image quality can be
with the correct settings superior using
CPU encoding and they haven't tooled
around with it in order to eliminate
that advantage of CPU encoding again
very interesting so what does this mean
for Rison there was a lot of speculation
before kb lake dropped that AMD was
putting it up against Broadwell ii so
that they had the advantage of comparing
rise into an Intel Architecture that was
effectively two generations old but now
that we've seen what skylake brings to
the table versus Broadwell now that
we've seen what kb light brings to the
table
IPC wise versus skylake
this is shaping up to be a very very
interesting fight and I can't wait for
sometime q1 2017 to get my hands on a
real actual retail chip and a real
retail board and I'm not the only one so
thanks for checking out this video
