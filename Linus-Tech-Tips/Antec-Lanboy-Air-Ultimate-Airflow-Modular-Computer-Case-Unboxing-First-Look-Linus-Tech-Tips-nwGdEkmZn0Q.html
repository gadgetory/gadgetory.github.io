you see this picture if it's not Tonka
or Lego then you've probably seen the
marketing for the land Boyer already
this is an Tech's latest and greatest
chassis it is fully modularized and
we're gonna talk a lot in this unboxing
about what exactly modularized means and
it is really unlike anything else we've
seen on the markets yet so the land boy
air the land boy series has been dead
and buried I thought for the longest
time I actually owned an original land
boy and then there was the super that
came with the smart blue 350 watt power
supply and then there was the super land
boy that came with that weird grille at
the front and since then there's been
not a whole lot but this is it pantech
has revived the land boy product line
with the land boy air so there you go
that yellow is not quite the same as it
looked it's not quite as Tonka like as
it looked on the picture on the front
but ok here we go so the first thing we
find in here is a little instruction
manual and based on all the things you
can customize on this case I'm gonna go
ahead and venture a guess that you're
probably gonna need it
land boy air grounding ok to show you
how to ground the case that's good how
to mount your two and a half inch SSDs
ok so there's a little manual on that
how to install USB 3.0 ok cuz it does
have one USB 3.0 port at the front as
well as a quick product overview so
here's a little product overview shows
be a bunch of stuff about it ok and then
a little survey that you can take to win
PC accessories Thank You Man tech
alright now I want to go through let's
take the case out of the box
typical forensic cases extremely well
packaged with good quality double wall
box as well as a high quality closed
cell foam packing material so you can
see that's not going to be a problem in
terms of shipping and then I wanted to
go through here and maybe I'll point at
the case while I do it or something
honestly I'm a little scattered because
I can't wait to get this out of the box
I've been looking forward to playing
with one of these in person since I
first heard about this case just because
like I said from anything we've seen on
the case market ever Wow actually looks
a lot better in person than it does in
photos I can see why ntek really wants
to do a lot of video coverage of this
the laws they've actually got a pretty
good video on their site right now that
shows off the land Boyer so first thing
we see here carrying handles even with a
fully loaded computer in there there's
no way these are gonna break off and I'm
really glad they didn't because that
would have made for a very anticlimactic
test of the land boy hair so they fold
down just like that and then let's have
a look at the back here so you can see
you've got support for a dual 120
millimeter fans right here at the top of
the case and speaking of fans the land
boy air although it comes equipped with
five 120mm fans supports up to 15 and
Antec is really encouraging users to use
every fan as an intake and because the
case is so covered in mesh and airflow
non-restrictive materials you can see
the whole other side of the case
is completely mesh what that means is by
using every
fetes and intake you can create positive
pressure inside the case which means the
air will naturally blow out of anywhere
that you don't have an intake fan so
what that means is you're able to keep
dust out of your case because everywhere
where there isn't a fan drawing air in
there's air of just blowing out of all
the little nooks and crannies of the
case so it's very very difficult to get
dust buildup in a case like that so
there you go that's why ntek encourages
you to take advantage of the positive
airflow design of this particular
chassis now the finish on this is just
phenomenal actually look at that
it's a very glossy black finish on the
top of the case looks like we're gonna
have support for up to a dual 120
millimeter radiator here in the top
although don't quote me on that I'm not
a hundred percent sure now in the front
of the case this looks like it should be
something what is that
well why don't we run through these
marketing bullet points so that we can
get a clearer idea of what we're dealing
with here
so the modularity optical drives can be
mounted in three different orientations
you can actually mount an optical drive
facing out this side of the case or you
can mount it facing out the front or you
can mount your optical drive facing out
the other side of the case same thing
goes for your hard drives the hard
drives use a new system called air
mounting and I'm gonna go ahead and take
this off these panels are modular like
many aspects of this case so the hard
drives use a new system called an air
mount which you can see it's like a a
rubber elastic thing and then you screw
your hard drives in and what that allows
you to do is reduce vibration and it
also allows you to mount it also in any
orientation so your hard drives can be
mounted with the connectors facing your
motherboard facing this way or facing
towards the other side of the case so
that's pretty cool - so you can mount
hard drives optical drives whichever
orientation you want but wait there's
more you can actually move around the
optical drives to be down here or you
can move them here and you can put hard
drives in the top if you feel like it
yeah you can actually customize where
all that stuff sits down here in the
very bottom you can see there are two
spots for two two half-inch SSDs so you
can do up to a raid zero with two two
and a half inch SSDs right down there on
the bottom of the case now let's go
ahead this is gonna be kind of a long
unboxing I've got I've got that feeling
that it's gonna take a lot to cover this
particular chassis okay
modular motherboard mounts yeah okay
we'll get into those a little bit later
okay so we've taken off the side panel
now so here we'll have a look at the
construction of the side panel as I
mentioned there's a lot of mesh on here
that's very conducive to good airflow
it's got metal pieces here but it's a
mostly plastic construction so what that
means is with the metal mesh and the
metal bars it actually retains a good
degree of rigidity
okay so then you've got your little an
tech design sticker there which is very
very nice and then okay well we took
that off let's keep on going then shall
we
here is the back of the motherboard tray
so the motherboard tray is modular let's
find out exactly what that means you can
ah yes you can move the motherboard tray
down so you see these screws here here
here here and here you can move the
motherboard tray down to the bottom and
then you can actually move the power
supply mount up to the top if you'd
prefer that you don't have to use a
bottom mounted power supply that's what
they mean by modular and the motherboard
tray I should also mention does support
up to eight PCI expansions lost so that
means you can mount a four-way SLI
motherboard in this chassis once again
it wouldn't be customizable in modular
if you can't know whatever you want in
it am i right okay back in the case
we've got a 120mm fan we got water
cooling grommets the aforementioned 8
PCI slots as well as your PSU modular
mount all right let's keep turning it
around I'll use the convenient carry
handles because remember this is a land
boy series case it is designed to be
moved around to lands presumably or to
your mom's house if she has a faster
internet connection than you and they
want to download something quickly the
point is you can move the computer
around I don't want to hear about it
okay so I'm just undoing screws here I
really wish I'd remembered my
screwdriver but I never do that's how I
roll camera man's gonna help me thank
you cameraman for contributing at the
very last minute and there's only one
more screw to remove cameraman I can't
even do it because he has Mac hands and
they're not strong enough I'm using a
Mac all day
oh wow that one is pretty tough okay
well give me a minute off-camera then so
we've opened up the other side panel you
can see here there are two
120-millimeter an Tek two-speed fans
mounted and the ones on the front are
tri cools the one in the back is a
two-speed in case you were wondering so
that means you can switch them between
high or low airflow mode with this
convenient low high switch look at that
the medium is actually there's still a
spot for it but it's like blanked out
okay so that's not a tri cool it is a
too cool now you can mount up to another
two 120 millimeter fans with the pegs
here and here and the holes here in here
so an Tek includes presumably all the
mounting screws you would need for that
so it means you can throw up to four
120mm fans on the side panel you can
orient them like this
and then you can put the side panel on I
hope now that I've said it I know you
can okay so you are into it like this
and then you just put the fans wherever
you want okay let's keep it rolling here
we'll keep looking at all the different
aspects of
boyer so here's our front panel
connectors which are secured with a
little to sky and let's go ahead and
have a look at those so because this is
not a very conventional chassis as I
mentioned ntek has instructions on how
to round out the case so you're gonna
want to attach that where Antec tells
you please do that you don't want static
build-up on your case because that is
bad static in computers bad not
grounding very very bad okay here is USB
3.0 and alright so you run that out the
back of the case you plug it into the
back of your USB 3.0 compatible
motherboard you've got USB 2.0 right
there reset power hard drive LED as well
as a power LED then you've got front
panel audio no firewire fire wires I
mean does anyone use fire I think I said
that once and then I had a bunch of
comments on the video I use firewire
yeah I know someone does but still not
very popular so here we go let's have a
look at what we've got in terms of
random mounting accessory so it looks
like I'll have to take out the power
supply mount for that alright I pulled
out the power supply mount which as I
mentioned before you can move up to the
top should you so desire and then I've
also got the box here which I was
surprised to find contained not
motherboard mounting screws or anything
else like that but rather only more air
mounts so they've gone and they've
thrown in one air mount for you just so
you get the idea but then there are
enough air mounts here to mount up to an
additional however many hard drives I
think it's eight that I could be wrong
here let's count them one two three four
five six seven eight nine I guess you
can mount as many as nine hard drives if
you feel like it but then you'd have no
optical drives so
it's completely up to you it's modular
and then it took me a little while here
to figure out where are the mounting
screws well they're in a little tool box
here at the front so I'm gonna go ahead
and oh no way you have to unscrew it
okay well I don't know how to get the
toolbox out now but yeah okay here
there's a toolbox in the front of the
case and that little box is gonna hold
all of your extra mounting hardware for
whatever it is you could possibly need
to mount in the land boyer and you could
never lose it because it'll always be
there and I think that's getting pretty
close to everything there is to talk
about here why don't you just get some
more internal shots of the case overall
the fit and finish of it is uh
much better than the mock-up that I had
seen before it feels quite solid despite
the fact that it's almost like a
framework construction here like you can
you can see there's holes in the case
like there's not a whole lot to it but
because they're using these solid metal
square bars it has a lot of rigidity to
it and then they've got mostly things
like metal mesh or others like
connecting materials that are just
giving it overall a pretty good pretty
good strength to it so I think that's
pretty much all there is to say but no
no come have a look at the front and
have a look at the front we haven't
looked at the front enough here alright
so at the front we find a bunch more
interesting stuff we find a great
antique shiny logo there which i think
looks terrific
and then we also find buttons so there's
our reset switch our power switch USB
2.0 front audio as well as USB 3.0 we
just haven't had enough of a look at the
five and a quarter inch bays it really
is a unique design like I almost wish
antec had like a like a stealth five and
a quarter inch bay cover that looks like
this because it's really kind of
cool-looking it stands out fits with the
aesthetic of the whole case like I said
before these can be moved around so you
see these extra mounting holes here at
the front you can what the camera man
don't get don't get distracted you can
see these extra mounting holes here at
the front so you can move these up move
these three down move them around
however you want and these at the front
are stepless adjustable try cool fans so
you can change the RPM in infinite
increments however you desire and then
there's that yeah you've got screws in
so that's that toolbox at the front let
me to see if I missed any points yes it
supports video cards up to 16 inches
without hard drives installed across
from them or up to 12 inches without or
with hard drives installed there you can
airmail the hard drives three different
ways USB 3.0 built-in handles infinite
cooling up to 15 fans plus a top mount
for water cooling and I think we've
pretty much covered it thank you for
having a look at the enttec land boy air
with us and I hope you have enjoyed it
uh cable management here on the back of
the motherboard tray you will find
little hoops for routing cables you will
also find adequate space between the
side panel over here and the motherboard
tray to mount even thick 24 pin cables
and now I'm done
cameraman wants me to do something else
he wants to see what's at the bottom of
the case there's Mac Mac people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
