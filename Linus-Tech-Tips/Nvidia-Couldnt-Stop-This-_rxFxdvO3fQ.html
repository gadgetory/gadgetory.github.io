a rock or if you're just not that into
gaming that - you've probably seen the
headlines AMD freesync working on
geforce cards and it's true but there's
a catch so the current methods for
enabling free sync on a GeForce graphics
card require you to also have an AMD GPU
in your system
that is capable of supporting freesync
itself so today's video then has us
trying it out to see if it's worth the
hassle
to save money on a g-sync monitor and
while we're at it we were thinking maybe
we'd try to run g-sync
on an AMD graphics card
rose wills new prison s500 case lights
the way with its array of RGB fans
tempered glass panel and spacious
interior click the link below to learn
more so let's start with how this works
there are actually two different ways to
go about this
there's the GPU a-and the APU way so
we'll be using the APU method for the
uninitiated and APU is AMD's name for a
CPU that has a graphics processor built
into it now normally as soon as you
install a dedicated graphics card your
onboard graphics gets disabled because
who would use that when you can use this
but for what we're doing we actually
need to force the Vega 11 GPU that's
built into our Rison 520 400 G on so
we're gonna change IG FX multi-monitor
to enabled and we are going to set the
primary video device to our onboard
graphics let's go ahead and reboot now
while we wait for that to happen let's
talk about what's going on under the
hood here if you watched our gaming on
Linux video a little while ago we showed
a piece of software called
looking glass that wendel from level 1
Tex was using to game with very low
latency in Linux by running the game
effectively in a virtual machine that
was running Windows and then capturing
its output TLDR the API that Windows is
using here is called DX GI and what it
does is essentially mirror the output
from one card to another with very
little delay though there is still a
delay so as you can see here we've
already got our geforce driver installed
and working so the next thing we need to
do we've already downloaded it here is
install the drivers for our Radeon
graphics
now that our Radeon drivers are
installed which
yes is working correctly we need to
change our display configuration a
little bit here so what we want is our
free sync monitor plugged into our
onboard graphics and we want nothing
plugged in to our GeForce graphics card
one cool thing by the way is that
because of the way that this works in
theory we could actually do the same
thing with Intel's upcoming integrated
graphics with free sync support that's
not confirmed at this time yet though so
now that all of this is done we can go
into our display settings then on the
bottom we're going to see an option here
for graphics settings now all we need to
do is add whatever we want to run here
okay so now we go into options and then
we just need to set our graphics
preference so we're gonna set that to
high-performance right about yeah see
here's our power saving GPU here's our
high-performance one now when we launch
this demo theoretically freesync
technology will work we can actually
test it to check this out so let's go
ahead and turn AMD freesync off oh we
got to turn vsync off
okay there we go that's more like it now
it's turning free singing off and boom
there's our tearing let's go ahead and
do an FPS sweep so we can get some
really nasty tearing there yep now let's
turn freesync back on
right alright let's try counter-strike
so V sinks off let's see how smooth this
is so in theory this DX GI thing only
adds about one to two milliseconds of
additional legs so for the people out
there claiming they can feel the
difference okay maybe but you're
probably superhuman because at 60 frames
per second that is what does that work
out to wait oh wow this feels like ass I
think this is running on the wrong GPU
so it's a little clutch
every one of your there we go for every
one of your programs you're gonna have
to actually change that let's see if we
can just remac summize it and it'll run
on the right one yeah that super did not
work let's try relaunching it there we
go that's more like it alright I am
getting a friggin mess ton of tearing
here when you're running free sync are
you supposed to enable vsync within the
game oh well there's there's our problem
also the developer console isn't enabled
for cryin out loud
one problem with csgo though is that
it's not demanding enough for us to dip
below sixty frames per second so it's
not really giving us a benefit over just
running vsync other than theoretically a
little bit less lag so what we're gonna
do then is we're gonna fire up Deus Ex
mankind divided can really tell us but
much smoother wow I suck
all right so here we go now we are right
in the sweet spot where we're gonna be
benefiting from our free sync display
where we're not quite able to maintain
60 frames per second but we're right in
that 45 to 50 FPS range
what kind of annoying thing about this
game is it has some on-screen effects
that kind of look like tearing but we're
not I'll see you like that but that's
not bad that's me dying I can't believe
that this is working like this just
blows me away okay so remember how I
said that because of the way this works
we could in theory use Intel's eye GPU
for free sync with an Nvidia card
actually churning through the frames
once those come out that got us thinking
what if we did it the other way around
what if you're on Team red so you're
running like a Vegas 64 but some baller
new gaming monitor is only available in
a g-sync flavor
Wow that happened so fast I didn't even
get a chance to show you guys check this
out so as soon as we plugged it in boom
g-sync display connected what so go
ahead and fire that up and able T sync
and able do you think for all the things
now all we have to do is the same
process but in Reverse going into our
graphics settings and going okay csgo we
don't why I performance we want power
saving now we can launch counter-strike
and in theory will be running g-sync
through our Nvidia graphics card but
will actually be rendering with our
onboard graphics now that wouldn't make
a lot of sense in this case but if you
were running something like Vegas 64 and
then you just installed like a geforce
950 or something in another slot you
could make it work whether or not you
should make it work is another question
though because unless someone automates
this GPU switching process it is a bit
of a pain in the butt at least at this
time and it's not that cost-effective
because one way or another you will have
to have two GPUs would you look at that
it feels a little laggy but that's
because we're running at 33 frames per
second there's no tearing and it's as
smooth as it could be given the
situation now one way that you could
make this solution make sense would be
if you had some old compatible hardware
lying around or actually maybe if your
team green in terms of your gaming rig
but you wanted to hook your gaming
machine up to one of Samsung's freesync
TVs for example because until BFG DS
actually make their way to the market
there are no large format g-sync
displays that could be pretty cool but
in most cases you'll probably end up
spending more than you are actually
saving or very close for what isn't an
amazing experience the real takeaway is
that we shouldn't have to do any of
freesync and visa adaptive sync are both
industry standards at this point and
NVIDIA if you're listening we're not
saying that you need to ditch g-sync we
know that you guys have special green
g-sync sauce that you pour on it that
makes it a little better in your
opinions personally I haven't looked at
with it with a high-speed camera yet but
you guys think it's better so ok we're
just saying that like CUDA and OpenCL
there's no reason that you couldn't
support both especially since as we've
demonstrated here there's no physical
link reason that you couldn't support
both team group is sponsoring this video
with their delta r gb SSD yes my friends
it's an r gb SSD they've got three
versions available so the USB gives off
a rainbow wave while the 5 volt and the
12-volt are able to be configured with a
variety of RGB software they've got read
and write speeds of up to 560 megabytes
per second and this is pretty cool if
you click the link below you can enter a
giveaway and the winner can choose
either a 500 gig Delta R GB SSD
or their T Force RGB 16 gig ram kit so
thanks for watching guys if this video
