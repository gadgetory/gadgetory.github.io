do this is the Fruit Shop bone
collection USB keys and so I have from
left to right a cat a panda a red ninja
and a black ninja
I think the ninjas are the coolest so
I'm just gonna show you kind of all of
them and then I'm gonna unbox one of the
ninjas so this is the red ninja
he has a red belt in being cool and red
and this is the black ninja and he came
from the other side of the black and red
village and he is the archrival of the
red ninja and then we have the Panda
he's just an innocent bystander in all
of this but he can't help that he's
being hunted to extinction by the red
ninjas because he has black on him so
that's why they are always trying to
kill him and then this this is mr. kitty
and he doesn't really care what anybody
thinks because he's all cool and he has
like look he has like a beard kind of
thing growing out of his chest off his
chest hair well he's got a lot of chest
hair so he's pretty tough you can tell
and so let's unbox the red ninja and
hopefully you see that I've won on box
two because if i unbox the red ninja and
the black ninja then they might like
cause a ruckus on my desk and then I'd
be in a boatload of trouble cuz I mean I
just moved into this office so if I went
and like had ninjas fighting in my
office already and I'd be in all kinds
of trouble so this is a four gig USB
Drive although anyone buying this
probably doesn't care too much about
like how many gigs it is because
ultimately it comes down to this is just
the coolest USB Drive ever so you can
tell that he's really he's really Stern
and doesn't take crap from anyone
because he has his fists down in balls
like this and also he has a sword but
his sword is bent because he doesn't
even need a straight sword to win the
battle so the packaging is pretty good
you can see that it comes apart like
this and then there's a foam so the foam
keeps the ninja from from actually
getting injured when he's traveling so
he can stand on the foam because when
you have
that cushioning on your feet it's much
easier to stand all day so if you
actually buy one of these what you
should do is you should keep the foam
and you should store them on there like
that so that he doesn't get tired
alternately if you want to put him down
on your desk you could do it like this
and then he will also be quite relaxed
so let's find out how to actually plug
this in because I don't know and you
pull off his bottom half there you go
and then oh there are two little metal
balls in here and I can't imagine for
the life of me what that is okay hold on
hold on so it's nano the ninja old
there's some really good there's some
really good art on here okay hold on
alone let's figure this out
okay support USB LED indication for data
access okay maybe he's like eyes light
up or something we'll have to figure
that out we'll try that I'll try that
okay so he is waterproof is he
waterproof what does that mean I don't
think that's water I think it's actually
music maybe it is water oh no don't put
it in water that's what it says here
he's sitting down on his USB connection
kind of like this see so he can lounge
wow it's like a built-in chair check
that out he's sunbathing okay what else
nano it's green like earth-friendly and
then also something else I have no idea
what that means okay so why don't we
plug him in okay here here I should give
you a closer look at sort of how he
comes apart so this is pretty much how
they probably all work is you you pull
them apart and then the plastic is or
the rubber is quite stretchy so it
should be no problem to go ahead and put
him back together many many times and
then the head it's actually oh yeah the
head comes off - oh it turns out he is a
red ninja but he's because I was
expecting maybe to find a different
colour mask underneath but that's not
that's not how it went down so a fight
what happens if I do that okay so the
belt actually holds the whole thing on
okay
that's what that I guess that's where
the drive is
okay I sort of got lost in the coolness
of it and I forgot about the technology
that actually has to drive it at some
point so why don't we just kind of plug
that in there so he's nice and flexible
so that means that even if you have to
bend back everything in order to get it
into a tight fitting port that should be
no problem so I plug it in and it is
detected by my computer
installing the device driver software
I'm a storage device and I'm gonna copy
something to it so that you can see the
okay I'm gonna grab one of my one of my
videos and I'm just gonna copy it to the
USB disk here I think it should be
called ninja by default that would be a
nice touch but they haven't gone and
done that
okay so we'll measure the right speeds
and also I want to see where the
indicator LED that they claim is on
there is so that's a reasonable enough
right speed for just a mainstream USB
Drive I mean you're not gonna be writing
a ton of data to a four gig drive anyway
but let's see you can figure out where
his indicator LED is oh it's in his head
can you see that can you see that
cameraman yes no yes okay good so it's
in his head so he actually has like a
glowing energy ball focused in his
forehead when he's reading or writing
it's his concentration energy that he
can channel through his fists and his
sword for the maximum of something I
really wish I knew what these like ball
bearings and his fists are for maybe
they're just for the shape I don't know
maybe they come oh oh oh they come up
hold on okay well here hold on hold on
let me cancel my file sensor oh it's up
around six megabytes per second well so
that's pretty good okay hold on soon as
it's done canceling then I'll be
to take him off of his seat here see
he's lounging again how much that would
finish oh hey I'm just gonna pull up
okay okay so here I'm gonna see what
happens if we pull these are his fists
of fury and they're full of metal for
much punching action in power so these
are just ball bearings I don't know how
I'm gonna get that back in there now I
really wish I'd thought this through
more thoroughly so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the Fruit
Shop bone collection and don't forget
that in addition to the red ninja you
could also buy a tiger but not a panda
or a black ninja because then they would
fight and all of your data would be lost
