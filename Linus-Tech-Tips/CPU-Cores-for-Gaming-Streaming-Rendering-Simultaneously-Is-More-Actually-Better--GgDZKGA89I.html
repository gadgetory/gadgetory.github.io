an 8-core hyper-threaded ddr4 fueled
monster of a computer processor that
seems to be positioned as the elite tier
CPU and gaming systems among boutique
system builders and yet doesn't appear
at first glance at least to offer a
compelling improvement over a more
mainstream and much less expensive ddr3
equipped quad-core processor like the
core i7 4790k perhaps there is more to
this than meets the eye though like how
I've been using an iPhone 6 for a couple
weeks I mean actually that one's pretty
easy I have a review coming subscribe so
you don't miss it anyway back to CPU
performance for now though Corsair
Gaming RGB keyboards feature precision
cherry on X RGB key switches for sixteen
point eight million color perky
backlighting for virtually unlimited
customization click now to learn more so
here's the problem with the way that
benchmarks are typically run in a CPU
review in order to isolate as many
variables as possible and keep the
results as reproducible as possible this
is the correct way to do things
scientifically speaking by the way
background processes on the system are
kept in check so only the applications
being benchmarked at a given time are
run and fresh system images are loaded
very regularly to ensure random extra
junk isn't interfering with getting the
best results possible however in the
real world a more cluttered environment
the kind where you've got you know a
thousand sometimes poorly coded random
apps in the system tray like bloated
gaming peripheral software antivirus
game streaming VoIP clients printer auto
updaters etc is often times more
realistic and beyond that power users
and prosumers may be interested to know
how their system will perform in games
when they intentionally have a demanding
application running in the background so
the test I set up is based on a worst
case scenario for a prosumer like a game
streamer some of
he's heavily into gaming and uses their
gaming rig for some content creation as
well so here's my hypothetical scenario
our pro streamer just finished editing
together a highlight reel in Sony Vegas
Pro 12 and is rendering the file then he
or she wants to fire up a game we'll use
far cry 3 at 1080p ultra details with 8x
NSAA wants to stream a four mention game
on Twitch using the fast preset with an
HD webcam feed in the corner using
xsplit wants to use screen capture to
have a buddy Skype in to join the stream
and then while all that's happening an
antivirus scan starts running in the
background so for the test I used an
Asus Rampage 5 extreme motherboard with
a core i7 59 60 X then I used the handy
dandy multiplier adjustments that all K
and x-series chips have along with a
Seuss's manual turbo boost controls and
hyper threading toggle to simulate the
performance of all the other CPUs in the
test so I'm using this the same platform
same OS everything so there are two
different ways to evaluate the
performance of our system here first up
we can look strictly at average FPS in
our game over a two minute span at the
beginning of my benchmark the
overclocked eight core runs away with
this
but not everyone overclocks and that
stock speed our quad-core 4790k with
hyper threading does just as well as our
stock 59 six the X which costs about
three times as much presumably thanks to
its high turbo clock speed of four point
two to four point four gigahertz adding
minimum frame rates to the mix gives us
a little bit more insight though now we
can see that our six core seems to be
struggling a bit thanks to its lower
core count or lower clock speed compared
to the other competitors depending on
which one we're looking at it against
and even though on average our quad
cores hold up against our eight core the
dips in framerate are 20% lower which
would normally be okay but what the
numbers don't even tell us here is how
noticeable the hitching and stuttering
is in each of those configs the eight
core configs on the other
and both ran the game with smoother
animations and the six core stuttered
occasionally but better than the quad
course the quad core with
hyper-threading was noticeable but
usable and the quad core without
hyper-threading was basically unplayable
and you can see a full explanation for
why these FPS numbers might look ok even
though the animations are terrible in
the video linked here but there's
another completely different angle that
we can use to examine this torture test
scenario to give us a clearer idea of
how the chips are holding up to the load
how well was the stuff in the background
running well first let's have a look at
dropped frames in the twitch stream only
our non hyper-threaded quad core dropped
frames here so we can see that our
simulated 4690k
was really struggling to multitask like
this in a way that the others weren't
now finally we can look at render times
it's a one minute chunk of my corsair
gaming k70 RGB keyboard video that i
exported at 1080p with cpu encoding
while everything else was running and
this is where we see the men separated
from the boys
our hyper-threaded 6 core stutters less
in-game and renders the video a full two
minutes faster than the hyper-threaded
quad-core even though its average frame
rates are not as good then our a core
improves frame rates smooths out
gameplay completely and knocks another
40 seconds off the render time with our
overclocked 4.4 gigahertz eight core
delivering smooth gameplay the best
frame rates out of all the configs and
also it manages to render the video in a
third the time of our similarly clocked
quad core with hyper-threading
so in conclusion am I saying any of this
is the kind of thing a normal user will
encounter every day or am I saying that
this is the only way to achieve butter
smooth gaming while working on projects
in the background absolutely not
using a device with an onboard h.264
encoder setting up a separate machine
for capture or utilizing a network
render farm are all strategies that
might actually be more elegant depending
on the exact workload no the point
- this video was just to explore the
effects of an overwhelming workload on a
variety of different configs and have a
look at what those lucky dogs with
8-core extreme editions can throw at
their machines before they even really
start to feel it and the answer I guess
is a whole heck of a lot guys
thanks for watching like this video if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it leave a comment letting me know was
this about what you were expecting did
you think it would be able to handle
much more did you think even the 8-core
would suffer love to hear from you guys
also check out the link in the video
description you can give us a monthly
contribution to help support us to make
videos you can buy a t-shirt cool one
like this which does the same thing or
you can change your amazon bookmark to
one with our affiliate code so we get a
small kickback whenever you buy CPUs or
tape or stands or whatever else it is
you buy on Amazon I actually got these
on Amazon great great product very
inexpensive anyway thanks again for
watching and as always don't forget to
