2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm so it's time to check out
so many sue systems we're going to be
starting with a couple of tablets that
are very closely related so these are
memo pad 302 series tablets both of them
and the key difference is okay this
one's got LTE okay this one is a Wi-Fi
only model this one's got eight hours of
battery life this one has 10 hours of
battery life and this threw me for a bit
of a loop because I wasn't expecting an
android-based tablet to have an Intel
processor inside it so it's an atom
z2560 processor running at 1.6 gigahertz
that enables asus to achieve the battery
life that they have on this and it's not
because of skimping on other components
they're both using full 1920 x 1200
resolution displays which I personally
love I like having the extra vertical
even when I'm using it in a horizontal
configuration and with a 10 hour battery
life you're now getting all day
computing out of it now this is
something that ASA spent a lot of time
on with this tablet and I personally
love it I actually preferred the
original transformer the 101 to almost
anything that came after it with the
exception of the Nexus 7 and the reason
for that is because i personally prefer
a textured finish on the back so if i
could get you to check this out they
have brought back the golf ball textured
experience to the back now the great
thing about a metal backing is it looks
fantastic in pictures which is fine and
good but at the end of the day you're
going to bring the thing home you're
going to stain it with your fingerprints
it's going to get warm to the touch and
what a plastic backing does is it is
more comfortable to hold you can easily
hold it with one hand and not worry
about accidentally dropping the thing I
think I'm making people nervous shaking
the tablet around like this but awesome
love to see the innovation it's also
going to be in a number of different
colors so this is a black one I think
this is the first time we've seen a
black back to tablet from a sous at
least in my territory so it might not be
the first time here but it's going to
come in a number of different colors
including white black as well as sort of
a pinky peachy color I was wrong
okay so I'm still happy because it looks
like black and I personally love black
tablets but apparently it is actually a
very dark blue so my bad and I also
should have mentioned before that both
of the tablets have two gigs of RAM
built in which means you're going to be
able to get a much more satisfying
multitasking experience now my big
problem with low-cost tablets in the
past has always been that you kind of
look at the thing and you go okay I
guess it's kind of built okay and you
know it's fast enough I could probably
use this just for some basic
functionality but the problem is that
the screen is always terrible just
absolutely terrible so this is where the
memo pad HD 7 comes in from a sous this
is a relatively low-cost tablet and when
I saw care so I'll reveal the price
later but it uses a low-cost Qualcomm
CPU it's got 1 gig of ram it runs
Android jellybean 16 gigs onboard memory
16 gigs of web storage it's got the
usual expansion so you've got a microSD
slot here on the left side it's quite
slim I mean not super slim it's kind of
about like a nexus 7 up on the top this
is neat you've got USB on-the-go support
so you can plug in whatever it is you
need to do via USB but this is the
kicker it has a 1280 by 800 IPS display
which means you get that viewing angle
and that content consumption enjoyment
that you just can't get from a cheap TN
panel and all of that is coming in at a
price that's below a hundred and fifty
dollars from a brand that you can
actually trust as opposed to one that
you've never heard the name of before
you have no idea if you can get warranty
support the games pretty much changed
now because there's going to be no
reason to buy a low-end tablet from
anyone other than a sous now the first
time we saw this concept was at CES with
the transformer AIO which was a
windows-based all-in-one but when you
disconnected the display it turned into
an android-based 18 and a half inch
tablet now we're seeing what I
personally find to be a more refined
version of that concept in a very very
usable form factor so check this out
this is the transformer book trio which
asus is calling the world
first three in one notebook tablet and
desktop PC so you can use it three
different ways right here they've got it
demoed attached to a keyboard so it is a
multi-touch windows notebook out running
an intel core i7 up to a core i7 4th
generation haswell processor you can
have up to a one terabyte hybrid drive
inside so that gives you that
performance that you need from an SSD
but with that mass storage that you like
from a hard drive okay then okay usage
case number two you detach it from the
base and all of a sudden you've got
yourself an Android tablet now this is
running an intel atom processor you can
have up to 64 gigs of flash-based
storage on it and you can see right here
if I pull out my my usual phone
thickness comparison we can't get these
things out of the case but that's okay
we can make do with what we have it is a
very reasonable size tablet in spite of
having all that extra connectivity that
goes into making it compatible with the
base station now let's move on to use
case number three you can actually use
it stand alone without the dock without
the Android operating system as a
windows-based PC so we've got an asus
monitor here this is from their MX
series this is the MX 2798 we've
actually check this out this features
they're bangin Olufsen speaker
technology so this gives you the ability
to use it as a dock without basically
plugging anything into it at all so
there's a single cable running between
the base station here and the asus
monitor although of course if you wanted
to use a mouse or something like that
you'd have to hook that up separately so
very very cool product giving you the
flexibility to use either windows or
android operating system and anything
from a notebook to a tablet to a sitting
at a desk type of usage scenario by now
you're probably pretty familiar with
asus zenbook line of ultrabooks but this
one is a little bit new now I wine and
gripe and complain incessantly about
metal finishes on the backs of tablets
on the tops of notebooks because the
problem with them is that they always
get all stained and fingerprinting and
ugly
check this out right here this has the
same kind of circular design hopefully
you can get a couple different angles
there and you can check it out as we've
seen on some previous asu's products
such as the tf700 but the key difference
here is that asus has Corning Gorilla
Glass 3 on not only the touch surface of
the notebook but also on the back of it
so what they're calling it as as their
tagline is clearly brilliant the
notebook that never loses its shine so
it will look like that from the day you
get it to the day you no longer need it
anymore for whatever reason and all
you'll have to do to keep it clean and
looking beautiful is give it a wipe down
so we can't get it out of the case
unfortunately but just for the sake of
size comparison if we can get kind of a
look at it it's a pretty familiar form
factor from what we've seen for me Susan
there's n book line it also features
Intel's new fourth generation haswell
core i7 processor meaning you're going
to get better battery life better
performance and with Gorilla Glass 3
better durability so it's much more
scratch resistant than Gorilla Glass 2
in fact there have been complaints out
there that old gorilla glass 3 doesn't
improve much over gorilla glass 2 from
guys that are more interested in phones
because it can tend to be a little bit
more breakable but it is much more
scratch resistant which personally I
don't drop my notebook that often so I'm
more worried about it getting scuffed up
and dinged up when I'm putting it in and
out of a bag very cool stuff now right
now behind us there has to be the most
obnoxious stage display that I've ever
seen before in my life but fortunately
this product isn't so much about the
audio experience and is more about the
visual experience this is the PQ 321
asus has already teased this so there's
a little bit of information that's been
available already but it is a 4k display
that means it runs at four times HD 3840
x 2160 so effectively this is for 1080p
displays stretched out now there are
some technical complications with 4k
that do make it inherently more
expensive in addition to just be
increased pixel density because this is
only a thirty one and a half inch
display compared to I mean obviously
it's a lot easier to put
you know in a 24 inch display only 1920
x 1080 pixels so there's that there's
the increased amount of image processing
that needs to go on and remember if
you're going to market a display for
consumers and intend for people to watch
movies and play games on it it's going
to have to have fast enough pixel
response time meaning faster processing
in order to make sure that you don't get
any motion blur or ghosting or input leg
that's going to take away from the
experience one of the other challenges
is inputs it supports a dual hdmi input
which means you're actually using two
hdmi ports in tandem but there are some
technological limitations there the
display interfaces haven't really all
caught up so the alternative is to use
display port which means you're going to
be able to run at the full 60 Hertz
refresh rate of this display without any
sort of funky monkey business it's using
a sharp exile panel which means that if
you've ever seen one of those you should
have some idea what to expect in terms
of viewing angles as well as color
reproduction but we might as well play
around with it a little bit here so we
can show you guys it does have pivot it
has height adjust so yeah whatever it's
it's sort of secured so I'm sure they
won't mind if we move things around
tomorrow okay I see it as I'd adjust but
apparently I can't move it right now for
whatever reason you can actually see all
the display inputs here on the side if
you want to check it out so a sous
generally recommends using DisplayPort
in not the dual hdmi input there's also
an audio in and audio I'll pass through
check out all that cooling on the back
of the display as well as well that
should give you some idea what I was
talking about before with the increased
I'll hit the increased processing that's
going on here I don't think we're going
to get pivot out of this one so it is a
bit on the heavy side because that tends
to happen when you get these large
format displays and personally I'm
incredibly excited about more than
anything else the gaming experience that
this is going to enable on the desktop
PC there was a thread on the linus tech
tips forum not that long ago about how
no games support 4k yeah no console
games pretty much any pc game going back
to like you know quake free you can
manually key in a 4k resolution you can
on that at extremely high res ultra
high-def 4k so thank you for checking
