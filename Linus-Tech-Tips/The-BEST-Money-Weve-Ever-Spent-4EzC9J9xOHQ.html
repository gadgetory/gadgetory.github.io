revolutionary so unlike anything we've
ever seen before gets released and today
it's my privilege to introduce to you
bigmouth Billy bass the speaking
sensation now with that Mazon Alexa
thermal takes a 500 has a modern
minimalist design with brushed aluminum
panels and dual him swing tempered glass
doors check it out today at the link in
the video description
come on in close come on in close let's
have some fun this truly is as Jake put
it a marvel of modern engineering so
this is big mouth Billy bass who you
might remember from such television
shows as big mouth Billy bass the
infomercial and big mouth Billy bass the
other infomercial lip sings to the
spoken responses of Alexa that is so
cool
dances to the beat of Amazon music
reacts to Alexa timers notifications and
alarms has a realistic appearance okay
we'll be the judge of that and includes
power adapter so in this box you will
find a USB cable it's a micro B oh no
types no types disappoint you know what
return forget it yeah we should
yeah I'm not gonna throw it it actually
looks pretty fragile so there's a
battery door on the back here you got
some oh you got you got your mountain
options here you got your two mountain
holes here which you can just throw up
you know I mean let's face it you've got
a big mouth Billy bass in your rec room
you don't mind putting a couple holes in
your wallet this will be on the wall of
the new employee lounge not negotiable
not ago not negotiable
David the crazy thing about this thing
is that it's not even expensive 40 bucks
which is less than an echo dot yeah so
let's go ahead and plug that there buddy
in there
whoa Oh loud mouth Billy bat a big mouth
scuse me loud mouth whoa big mouth Billy
bass he's a nice guy you're you are
something you are something else I don't
know about this realistic appearance I
think it's okay for will be paid
I don't know oh wow this is great in the
instructions which looked you know
pretty complete they've got a lot of
filler here so first there's the
important note then there's the note not
to be confused with the important note
then there's the caution
then there's the warning then there's
the if using batteries instead of
adapter please follow the instructions
put batteries in though in the most
verbose possible terms of batteries in
we've got the lyrics of the song it
sings no way that's the actual
instruction so this if this looked
overwhelming don't worry big mouth Billy
bass fans you can handle this oh so it's
not a fish-shaped echo dot I was even
more excited about this when I thought
that it was a standalone Amazon Alexa
enabled smart device so you can
basically just put a big mouth Billy
bass in every room of your house and
have Alexa everywhere but unfortunately
that is not the case so it actually
synchronizes with your existing echo now
in mode oh okay device hey James
but I'm never gonna take me down I swear
the old bigmouth Billy bass did more
than one song am I wrong I don't know
that's it's realistic look James you're
just confusing the realistic look for a
message it feels okay hey Alexa what's
the weather like currently in Surrey at
3 degrees Celsius with clear skies and
Sun today you can expect partly sunny
weather with a high of 5 degrees and a
low of minus 5 plate monstercat well
what you can't just play monster it's a
record so he just kind of spasms man so
basically you just have like a fish out
of water on your wall whenever music is
playing that's a bad kitty
what even is this hey Alexa that's up I
love hop hey Alexa start a 15 second
timer 15 seconds starting now okay so we
need to get a notification cheese should
I try message you or something after
after the time I don't know but I also
wanted so much to get a couple more of
these I think hey Alexa are there any
games you can play here are three of the
most popular games and trivia skills
first does it feed the room so he only
does some stuff no now he starts yeah
everyday question of the day poses a new
challenging question for you to respond
to from arts and entertainment to
literature and science do you want to
enable it yes interesting so it's only
like top level menus no oh and if you
would like for me to repeat a question
just say repeat the question here is
your first question of the day the topic
is history it is worth 4 points in what
year did American President Franklin D
Roosevelt declare that December 7th
would be a date that will live in infamy
you can choose from 1917 1939 1941 or
1945 41 41 1941 but I did not understand
your response 1941 it's working I know
right
1941 that's right oh you have earned
your first history badge at four point
so all that's left now then is for us to
gut poor Billy here
and see what makes them tick so what do
we got here we've got is it just one
motor that drives both the tail and the
head how does that work okay so this
motor probably drives the tail I guess
okay so first of all so here's our power
switch so that's just going over to the
motherboard here then we've got our
speaker which is going off the
motherboard here we've got our front
button right there that little doodad
right there we've got power to our
battery holder so that's right there you
can see there then we've got other more
different power coming in from our micro
B what do you see oh yeah they're right
there
there's our Bluetooth antenna and that's
probably even our bluetooth chipset
there's gotta be another thing in there
and we can pull this foam out not really
much what is this just like how does
their focus like I like a silicon kind
of feeling Oh what does this just pop
off it's started the fish I think you
know I'm Billy that's what it's for yeah
so it's just one scene this one's for
the mouth so yeah but the whole body is
just how do I mean I'm sure we're gonna
have everyone in the comments telling us
what very simple eight-point a helical
expr but yes it just uses this one motor
here for the head and the tail action
well that was somewhat anticlimactic
does big mouth Billy bass with Amazon
Alexa integration really need to do more
than dance around on your wall to your
music and then mouth along with Alexa
sometimes probably not so then I guess
that's where we leave it with a song and
this video is brought to you by I fix it
I fix this Manta driver kit includes a
hundred and twelve steel bits coming
with standard bits like Phillips and
flat head and also torques tripoint and
gay
