the lq 3 1 5 from Zalman this is an
all-in-one liquid cooler with a built-in
pump with a slim waterblock a copper
base and micro fins to maximize cooling
performance and I'm gonna turn it into
like like a song well do an unboxing
where we do lots of cool things like
opening things with knives and we okay
that was about as far as I got with that
so let's just go ahead and open this bad
boy up so this is a single 120
millimeter radiator liquid cooler it's
based on an ASA tech design which means
that there shouldn't be any huge
surprises in terms of the mounting
mechanism or the overall build quality I
think these LC LC sort of generation one
two three i what are we up to like four
generations now designs have been out
there in the wild long enough that if
there were any kinds of mass failures
we'd know about them already uses
durable and long lasting tubes an
additional 120 millimeter fan can be
installed and uses an environmentally
friendly anti-corrosion coolin oh that's
kind of good to know there's also a blue
LED included in the waterblock itself
which is not true of the 310 which is
the lower end version of this particular
cooler and the other thing that's not
true of the 310 is the fact that the 315
uses a thicker style radiator so one of
the things that Salman's done to set
their cooler apart from the other sort
of a Sutekh based designs out there is
they've added like a full aluminum
finish to the side here that's kind of
that brushed plastic finish that I
always talk about because I think it's
freaking awesome because it doesn't
attract finger prints and stains the way
that aluminum does but it actually looks
kind of like aluminum and it has sort of
a premium look to it that you don't get
with other more different with other
more different radiators they've also
changed the way the threading is done on
the shroud itself so if you look at that
they've actually got brass inlaid
threads rather than using just a simple
tapped thread through a metal piece here
so this is partly because this is a
plastic shroud so you wouldn't want to
thread plastic in order to mount a great
Afghan to something but I think this
should actually be more durable overall
anyway and it'll be less of a problem if
you accidentally screw something up and
strip it so that's that's a nice little
touch to see as well the pre-attached
tubes are one quarter inch and they run
to again a very sharp looking so it's a
better looking pretty liquid pre-done
liquid cooler than what we've seen in
the past so it's a better looking CPU
block unit there with a nice shiny set
on top and there is a blue LED inside
there that illuminates the block pump
unit is powered by a three pin by a
three pin fan connector that uses black
wires so it's not gonna look out of
place in your well done little build and
last but not least well second-last
also not least we have the mounting
hardware so this is the standard fare
that you see for these ASA tech units
it's got the updated one that allows you
to use one piece as a hold down another
piece to hold the hold down hold held in
place and then you actually use little
plastic Clips stick them through here
stick the screws through there and you
can mount it to pretty much any socket
you want including LGA 2011 now another
thing that they've changed that they've
included is almond fans almond fans have
been in my experience some of the better
ones out there as far as the overall
build quality goes they under volt very
well this one right here calls itself an
ultra quiet CPU cooler so I'd probably
believe it this one has a bit of a
unique design because you can see that
only one side actually has a square fan
mount on it and the other side is just
rounded here so the only challenge that
I would foresee with a product like this
is it limits your options in terms of
fan mounting a little bit so you're
gonna either be able to use it in push
at the back of your case mounting the
radiator directly to the back of the
case or if you don't have clearance at
the back of the case because of the tank
you're gonna have to mount it in push
which is the other option you have so
there's push from one direction or push
from the other direction and no wait no
you won't be able to do that oh yeah
that won't work at all because you'll
have to use a oh no they do have they do
have what you'd need but it'd be a bit
of a weird orientation because like
you'd have this against the case then
you'd have to go through the case
through here into the radiator in order
to get it mounted so I would have
preferred if they'd included a fan that
does have both sides but it's probably
not the end of the world and usually I
replace the fans on these things anyway
with something like something like a
knock to a fan for example don't forget
