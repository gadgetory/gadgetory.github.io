all it is the day that I'm going to be
unboxing a very cool product from
silverstone this is the silverstone hard
drive boost or HDD boost and he's also
an exciting day because it is the last
day of the esters easter extravaganza my
camera here and have a look at that
Esther's Easter extravaganza a chance to
win a basket bonanza sweepstakes where
you have a chance to win a card with
sorry a card a system with a GTX 480
graphics card so that is and this is the
code word if you're here looking for
that a fer me fer M I so without further
ado why don't we get started on the HDD
boost unboxing so it comes in a fairly
simple brown box you can see here and
okay yeah it's a very simple box easy to
install compatible with most two and a
half inch SATA SSDs minimum SSD data
right times help extend the SSD
lifecycle so as you may or may not know
SSDs do have a limited number of times
that you can actually write to the whole
disk and then we write rewrite rewrite
over it so while with most modern SSDs
it's not a huge problem they're still
saying that yes you know what this will
go ahead and it'll reduce the number of
writes that you're doing so it'll
increase the lifetime of the drive great
you can boost your original system hard
drive read speeds without reinstalling
your operating system that's pretty cool
too so create your home super drive with
maximum storage and maximum speed so
they're basically saying that you get
all of the benefit of an SSD which is
fast response times with all of the
benefit of a hard drive which is
inexpensive and high capacity so here we
are let me see it's Mikkel it is one
millimeter SPCC with nickel plating it
needs five bulletins from the PC power
supply the requirements are fairly
simply you need to have an SSD and a
hard drive so let's get this opened up
and have a look at what's inside the
first thing we're gonna see I'm gonna go
ahead and adjust my camera here I'm in
my little video sort of box so to speak
alright so let's have a look at this
package here first of all we will find
four regular sized hard drive screws and
two small ones with what looks like like
a small
threatening on them so we got six crews
in there the next thing we have is a
SATA cable with locking connectors all
right that looks like a six-inch cable
by the way and then we have the hard
drive boost Wow that was a very simple
package
okay so inside the hard drive boost we
will find a place to mount an SSD drive
yeah we'll find a place to mount an SSD
drive so you've got our two and a half
inch mounting holes here here here and
we have two that's it two holes okay I
guess that's what those two small ones
are for and then this is actually a
three and a half inch adapter so you'll
use those full-size screws in order to
mount this inside your computer so you
can see that the interface on the back
this is where it gets a little bit more
complicated
you've got your SATA power in then you
have SATA data then you have another
SATA data connector so this one goes to
your motherboard and then you will use
your existing hard drive cable for that
and then you can use this additional
cable to go out from this guy into your
hard drive so the chipset on here and
you can see that this is like a
proprietary looking chipset it just says
silverstone on that chip itself so we
have no way of knowing what's in there
is what does the logic that allows your
HDD boost to know whether it should
write any particular piece of data to
the SSD or the hard drive and where to
read it from so basically the HDD boost
is a way of treating an SSD kind of like
a giant cache it's kind of like Ram is
except sort of one tear down so you got
your CPU then your CPU cache then your
RAM then your SSD and then your hard
drive so it's one step faster to get the
data off here than it is to get it off
of the hard drive that's connected to it
so thanks for watching my unboxing of
the HDD boost and thank you for everyone
who participated in the Easter
extravaganza</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
