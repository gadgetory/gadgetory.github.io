monster results with this LSI 92 88 I
raid card and if you're a student F
you'll be able to see in the background
of the card itself you can see I've got
the battery backup unit here as well as
the the key that gives me access to
their Fast Pass fast path feature which
is optimizing for SSDs as well as
cascade which uses SSDs to optimize the
performance of your hard drive array so
I promised you monster numbers I have
finally come through sorry it's taken so
long to get this together but there you
have it when you raid together eight ocz
vertex 260 gig drives they are capable
of achieving 1.3 gigabytes per second
read that's a sequential read so it's
not all that indicative of performance
but it's still quite impressive
now bear in mind I did promise you guys
more than anything else more than one
gigabyte per second read speeds so
that's what I have optimized all of my
grade settings for you can see if our
eight identical OCC vertex two drives
here and they are running very randomly
off of the controller here so I've got
these long cables just running all over
the place but yeah bear in mind like I
said I could be optimizing for certain
other other performance but what I've
really gone for here is massive
sequential reads and it has finally been
achieved so just for comparison one of
these SSDs alone is capable of about 260
kick megabytes per second read and
actually hold on let me just find that
285 285 so you pair together or throw
together eight and we're really reaching
the maximum of what a raid card like
this can provide which is actually one
of the best RAID cards on the market in
terms of SSD performance so if you were
using a lesser raid card or in fact okay
why don't we start with onboard raid if
you're using onboard raid that is ich10r
the RAID controller built into your
Intel motherboard you're gonna camp out
around 600 megabytes per second so
adding its high-end dedicated controller
like this Nets you as you can see
much better performance so it doesn't
matter how many you hookup past about
three you're not going to get any
additional scaling whereas with this
particular card we can keep going all
the way up to the maximum number of
connectors we have and we continue to
get better performance now some other
raid cards will scale again better than
onboard but not quite this well so this
is one of the best examples
big thanks to LSI for helping us do this
little demonstration of what we can have
in the future if storage technology
keeps going the way that it is very
impressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
