the Kingston HyperX blue memory now I'm
going to zoom in and see if you notice
anything strange about the name of this
memory well it's the fact that all of
their memory is blue so this is just
more blue memory you would think but no
I actually have the press release up on
my screen and depending just how HD my
HD is you might be able to read it but
Kingston HyperX blue memory modules have
a new look so I'll show you the new look
once we get the Box open they run it
standard J deck speeds and timings but
the big benefit is that they have lots
of overclocking Headroom for enthusiasts
so it's kind of like what AMD is doing
with their black edition chips where
they're purposely running it at a
conservative setting in order to give
you more room to overclock them to
really find the limits in them so let's
get the blue 4 gig can't open here this
is a dual channel kit and it's available
in 6,400 ddr2 1333 ddr3 as well as 1600
ddr3 so I'm gonna go ahead and take this
out so it looks a little bit different
from their standard heat spreader first
of all you've got more of the chrome
accents so right here it says ddr3 now
we're used to not say anything and you
still have your shiny pink sticker which
I am a big fan of I'll turn it around so
this is a 240 pin standard dual sided
memory module you can see on this side
you know it's funny because I was
looking at it in the box and I was like
oh well how's the HyperX blue it doesn't
say blue anywhere on it it doesn't say
blue on the package it doesn't say blue
on the RAM but now I found it it says
HyperX blue on the back so that's just
silkscreen down there and then you've
got another ddr3 here so the actual heat
spreader is just plain blue in the
background you've got your chrome bar on
the outside ddr3 just like that and then
they actually are just putting stickers
and silkscreen on to get the two
different sides so that's a pretty good
cost saving measure if you ask me so
like I said two modules these are all
about the overclocking Headroom so what
I'm gonna be doing in the next little
bit is I did a big core I far rather
core i7 eight
5k so Intel's new unlocked chip I did a
big overclocking guide on that and the
whole point of that guide was now we can
overclock the CPUs as far as we want
without actually stressing the RAM so
I'm gonna grab that same test platform
and I'm gonna take a bit of a different
approach now I'm gonna see how far we
can stress the ram without stressing the
CPU since I have both up and down
multiplier adjustments as well as being
able to play around with the turbo mode
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the Kingston 4 gig ddr3
hyper X blue Ram</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
