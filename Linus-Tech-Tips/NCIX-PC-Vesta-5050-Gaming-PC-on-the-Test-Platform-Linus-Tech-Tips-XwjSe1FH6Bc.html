from the NCIX pc lab so this is the
vesta i 7 50 50 and what we've aimed to
do with this particular system is create
a flexible platform where users can for
the same price either choose a g-force
solution which is what we have running
on the bench right now or a radio on
solution so it's going to be available
in a couple of different configurations
that are going to be priced exactly the
same so basically you're going to get
all of this configuration plus either
graphic card so it has a core i7 960 so
with the recent price drop on the 960
you can now get a 960 at 3.2 gigahertz
for the same price as the 950 I mean
even though both cpus have been out in
the market for a similar time the 950 is
not going to drop any further it's just
going to pretty much be phased out and
the 960 is going to be a replacement so
you get a little bit more value for your
dollar that way we're going to be using
a cool it eco liquid cooling kit once we
get it installed in the real case which
is going to be an NZXT phantom white
right there so we're going to have
liquid cooling on that CPU so if you
wanted to do some overclocking once you
get your system then be our guest we're
going to be using mush can enhance
silver lion memory so this is ddr3 1333
very low voltage kit only a 1.5 volt kit
so you're going to be able to have
overclocking Headroom on that as well
the system is all about overclocking you
can see right here we've got an asus
sabertooth tough series motherboard once
again all about overclocking now
speaking of overclocking or using a very
high quality power supply which is one
of the things that is necessary for
pushing a system past its regular limits
so it's a seasonic 620 wat and as you
can see from our power meter here the
absolute maximum power draw we've
managed to achieve with this system from
the wall is 391 wats so since this is an
80 plus bronze power supply that means
that we're looking at about about 65
vishwas maybe about 70 watts less than
this in terms of actual power draw from
the power supply itself so only about
330 watts which means you still have
plenty of overhead even to add an
additional graphics card if you want and
the power supply will operate quite
silently so you can see here we're
running lost planet two very demanding
directx11 title we've scored a rank of a
in the test b benchmark and let me just
show you guys what setting we're
actually running all of this at so i'm
going to show you the settings uh crazy
russian says he's got it maxed out at
1280 by 720 what the deuce casey so
crazy russian hardcore failed running it
at the wrong resolution you can see
we're running the benchmark again now at
1920 x 1200 which would be a proper pc
gaming resolution not 1280 by 720 ok so
anyway let's keep talking about the
config while this runs and we'll show
you the overall score at the end so
we're going to be shipping this
configuration with a 60 gig ocz vertex
to SSD as well as a WD green one
terabyte drive for storage now I realize
we're not running off the SSD right now
but there's a very good reason for that
which I'm not going to get too far into
basically crazy Russian didn't bother to
install the OS on the SSD so that's okay
we're running our benchmarks without it
what else do we got here did you do oh
yeah if you guys want to check out the
relative performance of these two cards
on a like test platform you can check
out my video review actually the gtx
560ti where I cover these two cards as
well as the 560 TI in a variety of
modern games I think when we left off we
were just going to talk about the
performance so why don't we actually
hold off on filming until this is done
and we'll show you guys how this setup
performs in the demanding ever demanding
lost planet 2 directx 11 game alright so
there we go we ranked be which means
that the game is very playable ok so we
rarely dip below the 45 frames per
second range here actually you can see
the average is about 45 FPS so as long
as you don't go below 30 it's going to
be delivering a very
playable experience and this is without
any overclocking in any of these parts
so the system is going to ship for 14 99
99 and I'll do it update for you guys
with the radeon card versus the geforce
card at the equivalent price points once
we've got the system fully configured
and properly built within the NZXT
phantom case thanks for watching don't
