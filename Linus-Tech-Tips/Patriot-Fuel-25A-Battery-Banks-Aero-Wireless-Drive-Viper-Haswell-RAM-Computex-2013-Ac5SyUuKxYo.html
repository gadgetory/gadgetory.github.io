2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm here in the Patriot sweet
we have some old friends and some new
friends let's start with the new ones
this is the fuel plus line so these are
rechargeable battery banks so you've got
this guy right here is actually kind of
unique get someone to toss me an iphone
5 because what this has is it has a
lightning bolt connector that we can go
ahead and we can plug right into an
iPhone 5 so that you don't have to
really worry about now let's go ahead
and turn that on its charging instantly
so you don't really have to worry about
sort of any cables or anything that you
have to carry around with it this one's
not quite finished so we're not really
sure exactly what the finish want to
look like it's a 1500 milliamp hour
product though and then the main fuel
plusses so these are rechargeable
batteries this one is twenty 203,000
milliamp hours so optimized for your
smartphone that's going to charge pretty
much any smartphone from zero to
completely full it's got an input
charger and what's cool about the fuel
plus is that it acts as a pass-through
so you can actually have the phone
plugged into the one end and the fuel
plus plugged into a PC or a wall outlet
and the phone will charge through it
without charging the battery itself
because remember more charge and
discharge cycles is bad for your battery
there's a battery life indicator on the
side that uses nice bright blue LEDs and
there are a number of different
capacities so in fifty 206,000 milliamp
hour you've got this larger ID it's got
a nice red backing to it this one's got
okay your input port we were expecting
that and on the other side blue we
weren't expecting that that's a one amp
USB output and a two-and-a-half amp USB
output I'm going to repeat that that's a
two-and-a-half amp USB output so you're
going to be able to charge up your
devices faster on the fuel plus then you
will on any other portable battery pack
on the market today at least that I'm
aware of that's my little asterisk
because who knows what exists and sort
of like is Becca Stan or something like
that this is a 7800 milliamp hour and
nine thousand milliamp hour model that
I'll do my trademark smartphone
comparison I no longer do an iPhone
comparison because i don't think anyone
uses them anymore this is an HTC One
this is
how big it is this is how thin it is so
it's the kind of thing that maybe you
wouldn't keep in your pocket with your
phone but you might keep it in your
backpack as you're out and about at a
trade show say for example over here
we've got the Patriot arrow which you've
probably seen our content on just as a
reminder battery powered external hard
drive wireless you can get it in 500 or
one terabyte capacities it works with
iOS android kindle fire it lasts for
about five hours it can stream to five
devices simultaneously you can see
they've got it working on what actually
confused me i was like a laptop no it's
an ipad so there you go they're showing
off the iOS version right here moving
right along we've got of course with
Intel's fourth-generation core series
processor launched code-named Haswell we
have compatible memory from Patriot so
this is their 16 gig 24 hundred
megahertz memory remember guys Haswell
has an updated memory controller that
makes it much more cooperative with high
frequency memory not only lead not only
do they have a 24 hundred megahertz
Viper three right now but they're going
to be following it up with a 2666 Viper
3 and those should run on pretty much
any fourth-generation core Suri's
processor without any tweaks but if you
checked out our Haswell overclocking
guide you'll know this already as you
start to overclock the cpu you should
adjust your expectations in terms of
what you can achieve for memory
frequency so it's a matter of finding
that right balance between cpu frequency
and memory frequency this has been our
coverage of computex 2013 don't forget
guys we're powered at the show here by
