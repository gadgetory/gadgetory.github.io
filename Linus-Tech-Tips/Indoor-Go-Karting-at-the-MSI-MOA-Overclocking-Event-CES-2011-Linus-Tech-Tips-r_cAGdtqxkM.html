vegas and we've got Alex from MSI this
is my best impersonation of deadmau5 a
Canadian you know but whatever Kiah
oh oh they're calling me up to go race
but I want to check this out first so
he's actually changing the hose from one
of our liquid nitrogen tanks here to
another one so you can see he is
employing all of the highest technology
safety procedures that would be used for
a procedure like this including very
large oven mitts on one of his hands his
left hand all right so he is unscrewing
the hose with a crescent wrench that he
is applying the second glove and
unscrewing it the rest of the way by
hand so maybe when alex is done changing
the hose I can ask him whether we've
finished one tank and we still have our
two tanks and we still have four tanks
to go or whether it is for tanks that
were through and two tanks left to go so
actually it should be pretty easy to
tell yeah that seems full okay so it
looks like we're on to tank number three
and that is for all these guys to
continue their liquid nitrogen
overclocking adventures
safety safety speech which I'm obviously
paying a lot of attention to you right
now I'm not don't turn around but I'm no
don't turn around but I'm going to be
racing my msi sales rep as a lot of you
guys probably know I have a product
manager at NCI act so I pulled them he
has to give me a special deal if I beat
him in the go-kart race today at the
other side moi event at CES okay so i
got my head soft on just gonna throw on
my helmet and then we're gonna get
geared up for the for the car race here
that's way too big I may need a small
okay
you forgot your side that's not my size
that's what blank says it's been a while
since I've ordered a helmet so low easy
on me hmmm ok area
how is that all right oh okay here i am
getting into my card number 27
apparently petals are more accessible
our safety harness here
okay so hopefully the next footage I
after you
he's actually he's actually of me going
around the car went there and around the
track instead of sitting here a man in
my coffee hit area
so slow
we have on see when you nigger
might be a go karting adventure here at
CES at the MSI overclocking to event and
I haven't checked my time yet by I hope
that I beat my sales rep because if I
did I may be a promise made some kind of
stupid deal on something in the eye and
the near future here so that was the
stakes and I committed absolutely
nothing to him if he wins so it's kind
of a win-win sort of situation here so I
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more overclocking unboxings
reviews all kinds of tech videos
thanks for checking it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
