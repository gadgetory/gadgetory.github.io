tips video you guys have asked for this
this is the performance evaluation of
the Kraken X 40 and the Kraken X 60
what's the advantage of a Kraken versus
a some other liquid cooler well compared
to 120 millimeter radiators it offers
36% more surface area which makes it
more effective for cooling with well
larger fans that can push more air with
lower rpm or well no the same air with
lower rpm or more air with the same rpm
yes either of those things so we're
gonna be checking out not only the
kraken x 40 but also the kraken x 60
which has actually whoops not quite made
it to the test bench yet not every case
can accommodate the kraken X 40 and X 60
you have to have for the X 40 a 140
millimeter fan mount that has enough
room around it for you know the tanks at
the end of the radiator and well the
tanks at the end of the radiator as well
as the additional thickness that's
required to have the fan and the Kraken
mounted there and for the kraken x 60
you have to have a dual 140 mount with
enough clearance for a read and a fan
and you have to have the correct spacing
for the mounting holes or you need to be
willing to whip out a drill and make it
happen which is what we're gonna be
doing with the vengeance c70 here now
the vengeance c70 is our standard
testing bench so I'm going to go through
our standard testing procedure really
quickly here so number one is we monitor
the ambient temperature with a multi
logger thermometer so we monitor that at
the intake on the case that tells us
what temperature the air being used to
cool the computer is then what we do is
we correct whatever temperatures we get
to 20 degrees Celsius giving you guys a
normalized temperature yes it works this
way don't doubt us on this it's okay if
your room temperature goes up 10 degrees
your CPU temperature will go up exactly
10 degrees so we're reporting what you
will realistically observe in a sort of
a normal climate-controlled house okay
fans we do not use the fans that are
included with liquid coolers yes there
is a value add to the manufacturers
including better fans we recognize that
but we are looking at it in terms of the
cooler
with a fixed fan usage scenario and a
fixed noise level so we're gonna be
using high-quality nacht to offense in
the case of the Krakens we are not going
to be able to use our standard n FF 12s
and we will instead be using our
standard nfa 14 FLX fans these are both
pressure optimized fans but the
difference you'll notice is that one of
them is 140 ml and one of them is 120 ml
they spin at the same rpm and are
approximately the same audible noise
level so you know that's holds in line
with our methodology of using them sort
of in the way that we would use them
however we don't run a fan low noise
adapter on this one and we do run one on
the 120 because that's how we get them
running at the same rpm
we always run our benchmarks in a closed
case with a real system so in this case
we're using a GTX 580 from MSI running
combustor to generate a heat load
because in a real system the inside of
the system will have other generating
components we're running a 3930k
overclocked to 4 gigahertz and you can
see here that we also have a procedure
for mounting the fans as well this will
always have a 120 this will always be
dual 120 s up here except in the case
where we are replacing it with 140
millimeters in order to mount a 140 ml
rad so there's the kraken x 40 you can
see over there what we do for our idle
test is we just idle it and what we do
for our load test is we run combustor
and prime95 small FFT then we take the
CPU temperatures after a period of about
5 minutes
once they've equalized and report them
to you so that's pretty much the
procedure I can't show you these numbers
now because I've gone and removed the
side panel and we've changed a few
things but we've already recorded
numbers we're gonna go ahead and mount
the kraken X 60 and show you guys what
we had to do to a C 70 to get it to work
now with the kraken X 60 what we
discovered is that compatibility is
maybe not quite as much of an issue as
NZXT and/or other case manufacturers
would have you believe because here is
the X 60 mounted and of course our
vengeance C 70 case which supposedly it
doesn't work with but we made absolutely
no modifications to the configuration
whatsoever the one challenge you can see
we've only mounted it with four screws
here but we could have put in all eight
is that the heads of the screws are not
that big so we had to kind of sort of
you know put them all in at the same
time otherwise you could kind of you
could pop it through if you didn't have
all the screws in because you can see
they're not quite centered that was the
only issue other than that it mounts
fine the clearance is perfect
once we're it once we're inside we had
the barbs at the back so if you had
actually here slick if you want to come
around to the other side and give them a
look inside there and you'll be able to
see I hope unless here bulk blocks it so
the barbs come out right above the RAM
over there if we had VRM heatsinks over
there then that might be might be a bit
of an issue he wants me to take off the
side panel but we haven't recorded our
temperature readings yet so why don't we
do that first remember guys we take all
our temperature readings with a closed
side panel so we recorded our ambience
and our load temperatures I just want to
remind you that we take the second
hottest core so in that case it's this
guy at sixty-five and so we're gonna
plug that in and find out how this
particular cooler performs so this is
not really what I was expecting it does
perform better than the x40 so it's
about 6 degrees better than the x40 also
the fan or the pump is very satisfactory
on this one we don't hear any grinding
or or whining but it doesn't perform as
much better than the h100 I as I would
have expected so that still puts it at
the top of our charts I want to be very
clear it is still the top performing CPU
cooler that we've had run through our
lab so can't take that away from it it's
possible that if we had our CPU more
over volted or if we had a higher
wattage CPU that we'd see it pull away
from the H 100 more it's also possible
that the the NFF 12s being a higher tech
fan than the a 4 teens are better
optimized for pressure even though both
sets of fans are running at the same rpm
and the a14 are inherently larger and
should therefore be able to push more
air through the heatsink well peeps
ain't radiator whatever you want to call
it so here I want to show you guys how
the clearance was so if you did have
tall drm heat sinks here or up here at
the top and you can see that this would
not have fit but we were able to get it
in with our EMA side
65 X 79 board just fine and you can also
see that there's no interference over
here with any kind of five and a quarter
inch bass as well so it's an extremely
satisfactory installation experience in
spite of the fact that this case is not
listed as compatible so thank you for
checking out this episode of Linus tech
tips where we've had a look at the
performance of the Kraken X 40 and X 60
if you guys want to see our performance
charts we're actually going to have a
link under the video so you can go ahead
and check those out at your leisure so
you can see all of our results for
various colors on our standard test
bench and we're gonna keep updating that
over time don't forget to subscribe
obviously no review of the Krakens would
be complete without having a look at the
included software now we had CPU
temperatures working before I had to
reinstall this just now so that might
just be sort of a weird thing and fan
speed does work we just don't have the
fans plugged in right now but I just
want to show you guys the feature so you
can monitor your pump speed you can know
if your pump failed you can see the
liquid temperature as well as CPU
temperature so you can monitor your
deltas here's a graph of fan speed rpm
as well as temperature fan settings
these are cool so you can set up a few
different curves one for silent so you
can see that the fan speed here on the
y-axis doesn't start ramping up until
the temperature here on the x-axis
starts to get up to around 45 degrees
you can actually move these around so
you can make things as extreme or well
that's a hundred so you can't really go
any higher than that but it's not gonna
let me move that okay no interesting may
be the custom want to let me move that
oh no it just wants you sort of it wants
a hundred percent to be around 65
degrees and then you could I mean you
could also just go one hundred percent
earlier if you wanted so there is a lot
that you can do to play around with it
and then right so you can just change
the dial to extreme silent or custom
whatever you prefer and light settings
so it's got RGB LEDs inside you can
change the colors you can actually have
different colors if the temperatures are
high you can have it fade and strobe at
intervals and general settings are here
so you can monitor in Fahrenheit if
you're from the US of A and auto start
liquid temperatures all that kind of
good stuff so once again don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips from our boxing
and other incomplete videos until we
come back and finish them and then
they're done and then now we can
actually say by in turn the camera off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
