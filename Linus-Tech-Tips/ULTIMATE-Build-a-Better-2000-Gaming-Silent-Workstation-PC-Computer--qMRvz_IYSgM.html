guide now a better system involves parts
that still deliver great value for the
dollar without going over the top just
for bling but also means that we're not
really skimping on anything
so our target budget for this system was
$2,000 now in our last build guide we
went with a straight gaming build so we
didn't really spend extra money on
anything unless it gave us more cooling
or more gaming performance in some way
this system is going to be more about
well-rounded overall performance so it's
still going to be a rockin gaming
machine featuring the intel core i7
4770k unlocked processor we're still
going to overclock it but maybe not
quite to the same extent and it also
features because it has hyper-threading
because it's got lots of RAM and because
we're using silence optimized components
a very quiet workstation like element to
it as well so it's going to be the
silent machine that's suitable for
gaming as well as light workstation use
such as HD video editing now we're going
to show you how to build step by micro
step exactly the system we have in front
of us but many of these principles will
be able to be applied to other systems
as well so we'd love for you to come
back and reference this video when
you're building your own system with
that in mind we've made some menu
navigation so you can go to the main
menu up on your top right and you can
navigate between chapters on the bottom
right allowing you to skip in between
the parts that you find most interesting
now it should be noted we're using
annotations to make that functionality
work so if you're watching on a mobile
device you may not be able to access
that functionality if you switch over to
a desktop that'll work just fine for you
now without any further ado let's get
started with our better gaming / Lite
workstation build optimized for silence
now with our better class of system sort
of nomenclature in mind we did give
ourselves a bigger budget this time
around because we were trying to do a
couple of more specialized things that
is to make the machine great for not
only gaming but also light workstation
use as well as make it quieter so with
that in mind for our CPU we went with
the 4770k
this is a core i7 processor meaning it
has hyper-threading technology so while
it doesn't really offer much tangible
performance benefit over a top-tier core
i5 like a 46 70 K in gaming applications
the 4770k will deliver a significant
performance improvement in things like
video editing or 3d work to justify its
additional cost
now the i7 4770k is an LGA 1150
processor meaning that it's compatible
only with LGA 1150 motherboards so we
went with a sabertooth dat seven board
this supports all the overclocking
features of the chip as well as other
Intel technologies such as Smart
Response technology with SSD caching and
all that good stuff and it also has some
Asus exclusive features as well it's got
their thermal armor which is a dust
coating that goes over top of the entire
board and even you can have little
pieces to cover up the slots allowing
you to keep the board operating in
pristine condition for the extent of its
lifetime it has their thermal radar to
technology which allows you to quickly
and easily diagnose hot spots on the
board as well as monitor the board make
sure your entire system temperatures are
good it has their fan expert to
technology allowing you to control all
the fans in your system and keep
everything nice and cool and optimized
you guys noticing a theme here and it
also looks fantastic and since we're
using a windowed case that is an
advantage last and certainly not least
the reason we went with a sabertooth
Tough Series board for our workstation
II better gaming build is the fact that
it uses tough components and comes with
a five-year warranty a su supports this
board for five years
that's industry-leading meaning that if
you're buying something that you want to
really work for a long time a tough
series board like a saber tooth is never
a bad option the one thing you may
recognize from our last better build
guide is these Corsair Vengeance ddr3
modules we didn't change our memory
configuration because I still feel that
a 2 by 8 gig ddr3 1600 kit is pretty
much the best bang for your buck it does
a number of things it gives you a
great ability options for the future
meaning you can move to up to 32 gigs
without any difficulty without taking
these out and tossing them in the bin
and it gives you definitely more memory
than you need for any modern game as
well as probably enough memory for your
light workstation load however if you're
doing a lot of DaVinci Resolve
or you know After Effects rendering or
whatever else then you may want to right
from the get-go step up and get two of
these kits for a total of 32 gigs now
our budget gave us a ton of options in
terms of graphics cards we could go with
an entry-level Quadro we could go with a
dual GPU solution with fairly high end
cards we could go with a very high-end
single card solution such as a GTX 780
that's the route that we ended up going
and the reason we did that is because a
single GPU solution still delivers the
best performance regardless of micro
stuttering or SLI profiles in any game
it also runs extremely quietly runs cool
and it's going to offer great CUDA
performance for applications such as
Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve now
why we might go with some of those other
options dual gtx 660ti s would have been
better for gaming performance but would
have added heat output power consumption
as well as a little bit of inconsistency
in terms of the performance and I
usually prefer a stronger single card to
two weaker ones whenever possible we
could have gone with an entry-level
Quadro and honestly if I was going to
take advantage of the 10 bit color
output or if I was going to take
advantage to some of the CAD
applications that can be accelerated by
a Quadro then I might go that route
instead
but that won't offer a satisfying gaming
experience like a geforce card will now
we could also pony up and spend more and
get a GTX Titan but that contributes
nothing to the gaming experience and is
more useful for someone like a CUDA
developer that needs the
double-precision floating-point
capabilities of a GTX Titan that are cut
down significantly on the 780 last but
not least if we were leaning more
towards the gaming side and we were
willing to wait for Adobe to upgrade
their suite to support OpenCL with all
the features or if we didn't need some
of the
Kuta only features right now you could
go with a Radeon graphics card such as a
79 70 gigahertz edition and you'd also
get some free games to go along with it
with their never settle bundle and we're
going to make the most exciting video
ever about storage alright
storage isn't that sexy but we've got an
Intel 520 series SSD this is their
highest performing consumer grade SSD
and we went with that because again we
had a slightly bigger budget we also
upped the capacity we've got 240 gigs
now that gives us flexibility we can
either install a ton of apps and games
on it or we can segment 60 gigs of it
to use as a cache to accelerate our
mechanical drive now this is where it's
going to come down to personal choice we
went with a three terabyte WD green
drive and the reason for that is that
with its low power consumption and quiet
operation it was a good fit for our
build here however if you wanted to use
a dedicated scratch disk or if you
needed more storage for large video
editing projects you might end up with
an internal raid array for example and
then an individual dedicated scratch
disk rather than going with this single
green drive solution so the options are
totally out there but remember guys
green isn't like it was before where you
were getting great power consumption and
low noise at the cost of performance
particularly in sustained performance
they're right up there with many 7200
rpm drives now so you don't have to make
that trade-off and that's why we went
this route well excuse me now I've
talked a lot about the silence optimized
aspects of the system but I haven't
shown you how we're doing it yet it
starts with the power supply a loud
power supply is difficult to deal with
because you can't just swap out the fan
without special training or pretty
serious danger so we've gone with a/c
Sonic G Series C sonic has a legendary
reputation for moving quiet as well as
high performance power supplies in fact
many of the power supplies you see in
the market with other brand names on
them are actually manufactured by C
sonic this one is 80 plus gold meaning
we don't have to remove as much heat
from the inefficiency of the power
conversion
it is also semi modular meaning that we
don't have to have an S
sorry cables jumbling up the case so we
don't have to have our case fans
spinning louder it uses a single strong
12 volt rail meaning you don't have to
worry about what plugs into where and
last but not least it has a five-year
warranty to go along with that five-year
warranty on your motherboard now those
two components that fail most often over
time the motherboard as well as the
power supply have five year warranties
in this system now it's only a 550 watt
power supply but I'm going to show you
guys what the power consumption the
system looks like when you're done and I
think you're going to be pretty
impressed at the way it handles it even
though NVIDIA recommends a 600 watt
power supply for a GTX 780 based system
next up we've got a dark rock 2 CPU
cooler it looks great it's quiet it runs
cool no complaints about it whatsoever
we decided to go air cooling with this
build rather than liquid cooling we
showed you liquid cooling last time so
we're going to shake things up finally
we've got the fractal design define our
four this is the black windowed version
but it's available in different colors
or without a window if you prefer it is
again
silence optimized with acoustic
dampening materials as well as it has
the ability to provide ample airflow
with ventilation in the front and it
gives you the option to remove some of
the silence optimized material and add
more fans with their mod you vent
technology should you so desire not only
that but it looks fantastic
oh my case is gone I guess that means
we're going to talk about peripherals
now we're going to start with the Razer
DeathAdder 2013 I think it's a fantastic
value even though it's a little bit of a
higher-end Mouse so while the
peripherals don't fit into my $2,000
budget the goal here was to pick
peripherals that I thought were
appropriate for someone spending two
grand on their Tower and the Death Adder
2013 has great heritage the death adders
extremely well regarded but it's got
some tweaks a higher sensitivity optical
sensor making it great for gaming
without any acceleration issues it's got
tweaked argh anomic as well as
rubberized grips that make it feel great
and I just like it so there you go next
up we've got the Philco magic ninja
we've got a Cherry MX brown full-sized
keyboard this gives a good balance
between a typing experience and gaming
experience I personally love Cherry MX
brown key
switches and it looks fantastic and very
professional with the key caps printed
on the front rather than on the top that
also means that the printing will last
forever because it won't wear off with
your fingers for our mousepad we've gone
with the SteelSeries qck because
regardless of budget I use it for
everything I love this mousepad just
just get one even if you're not building
the system don't worry about it
now let's talk about the peripherals
that you don't generally touch we went
with the custom one pros from Bayer
dynamic for our headphones these are
closed making them great for going off
to your own little world whether it's
work or play they sound fantastic they
have an adjustable base port meaning you
can decide okay I want a ton of base for
this music or not as much for another
one which is actually very very cool and
last but not least they are incredibly
comfortable these are the personal
headphone of choice for slick right now
the one drawback being they don't have a
built-in microphone so you will need a
standalone microphone for our monitor
this is what I expect to be a bit of a
contested topic now many gamers will opt
instead for fast response TN panels
because those are going to give you less
motion blur as well as less input lag
when you're gaming now slick and I
discussed it at length and we decided to
go with a PA 248 this is a pro art
series from a soos because we prefer the
vibrant rich colors in better viewing
angle to the faster response time for
our gaming enjoyment with that said
neither of us are pro gamers so what's
the advantage of this monitor it's 1920
by 1200 instead of 1080 giving you a
little bit more vertical resolution it
comes pre-calibrated meaning those
colors are going to be accurate right
out of the box and honestly having gamed
on this monitor a fair bit I don't
notice any particular input lag I don't
notice any particular ghosting even
compared to TN panels so I'd say for the
price given that the 248 isn't that much
more expensive than a TN panel
especially a gaming grade one I would go
with this option but of course the
choice is yours
and now it is step by step ah I got kind
of far away from the mic there time to
build this PC so we're going to start
with our usual procedure where we
install the compose
once we assemble them together before
putting them in the case to make sure
that everything is working they okay
before we make more work for ourselves
when we're trying to swap things in and
out in there inside a chassis the
motherboard box makes a fantastic test
bench before we get started here's
everything you need a nice anti-static
place to work I don't recommend working
on carpet if you can avoid it we are
actually using a mod mat Xtreme from mod
rate which is a nice rubberized surface
so we're not going to damage anything
it's not going to slip off away from us
and it's anti-static I recommend using
an anti-static wrist strap that you then
attach the other end to either a
grounded out power supply or similar or
to a grounded wall outlet and finally
you'll need a standard Phillips head
screwdriver first up once we've got our
motherboard on our well makeshift
anti-static test platform is to install
the CPU the only things you need from
the CPU box are the processor itself and
the stock heatsink which we're only
going to use to make sure that the
systems working outside of the case step
one is to lift up the retention arm
there shouldn't be too much force that
you need to apply once it's out of the
way you can actually lift up the entire
hold down plate next up align the golden
triangle on the corner of the CPU with
the triangle or dot on the CPU socket
there should also be two indentations
the CPU only fits in one way never force
it the socket is very fragile give it a
little wiggle to make sure it's in the
right spot lower the cover plate and
then bring down the retention arm there
should be a little bit of force required
this time you'll have to swing it out a
little bit wide and then hook it
underneath the hold-down clip and what
you'll notice is that protective
covering over the pins in the CPU socket
now pops off completely on its own and
your CPUs installed
installing the stock heatsink is a snap
well four snaps actually it has thermal
compound pre applied so you don't have
to worry about that just make sure that
you have enough slack on the four pin
CPU fan connector to reach the header on
your motherboard I'm going to plug that
in there we go then apply pressure in a
diagonal fashion to the four hold down
pins until you hear them snap into place
installing RAM is easy as pie 3.14 that
is I usually recommend using the two
slots that are furthest away from the
CPU socket and then all you have to do
is make sure that you align the notch in
the bottom of the RAM with the notch in
the socket in this particular
motherboard you can see only one side
has a retention clip so put that side
and put the side with no retention clip
in first then press down firmly until
the clip goes into place rinse and
repeat
please don't rinse your memory now it's
time to move on to the case so we're
going to open up the side panels both
side panels because we're going to need
access to the back of it for all of our
cable management keep your screws
somewhere safe I recommend keeping them
in a small dish such as the one that I
of course have readily available right
here thumb screws go in there and put
your side panels somewhere safe the last
thing you want to do is trip over them
or something like that and scratch them
or dent them before you even have a
chance to put together your computer I
recommend putting them in the box that
they came in with the packing foam in
between this is an optional step but I
like to do it so you take the box or
baggie or whatever the accessories for
your case comes in open it up and dump
them all out make sure they're all there
this particular case comes with a little
inventory on the back of the box that
tells you exactly what should be inside
then you take all those pieces and dump
them in your tray that way you know
where everything is when you're looking
for it and you don't have to be fumbling
around the next thing to install is the
i/o shield so you're going to regret it
if you forget this one so I recommend
doing it first all you have to do is
take it out of the motherboard box
position it at the back of the case
sometimes there's a placeholder there
don't worry you're not supposed to use
that just take it out on this case we
don't have that though and then press on
all four corners firmly until you hear
them snap into place next we're going to
prepare the case to have the motherboard
inside it fractal includes a little
adapter from Philips head to the hex
pieces that are
motherboard standoffs that you're going
to screw into the tray they also clearly
label with an a4 ATX and an m4 M ATX or
shorter motherboards where you need to
put in the standoffs we're going to put
in nine standoffs in all the ones marked
a next the motherboard goes into the
case I'd really recommend laying your
case flat before doing this then what
you do is you position the i/o on the
back of the motherboard with the i/o in
the back of the i/o panel which you just
installed slide it into place very
carefully without scraping the back of
the motherboard against the motherboard
standoffs that you also just installed
I recommend holding the motherboard by
the CPU heatsink that stock heatsink
that we're going to take off in order to
prevent touching sensitive parts on the
motherboard or putting undue strain on
other parts of it once it's in position
put in at least one screw so that it
holds in place then put in the other
eight screws and your motherboards
installed now we're ready to get that
stock CPU cooler out of there and
replace it with our aftermarket one now
the reason we put the stock one and in
the first place was just in case we had
some weird clearance issues while we
were trying to install things in the
system we didn't want to you know have
to take an aftermarket one back off
because it can be a little bit more
difficult than the plastic push pins
that are used on the stock one so I've
pulled that off now OOP now all we got
to do is install our aftermarket one
after of course cleaning off the CPU so
use 99% isopropyl alcohol wet a piece of
toilet paper clean off the bulk of the
thermal compound then follow up with a
lint-free cloth that's going to allow
you to make sure that there's no residue
left on the CPU next up you're going to
put some thermal compound on your
coolers going to come with thermal
compound put on about the same amount as
about a cooked grain of rice is what I
would go for for a modern CPU now we
need to make a decision about how we're
going to orient the heatsink in our case
now if we had top exhaust we might
consider mounting the heatsink
horizontally like this so we could take
advantage of it but we left the mod you
vents
in which means we don't have top exhaust
so we're going to opt to position our
heatsink vertically like this then when
we install our fan afterwards we're
going to install it pushing air towards
the back of the case pulling air through
the heatsink so that we're leveraging
that rear 140 millimeter exhaust now to
install it you want to make sure that
you have enough clearance around your
RAM for the side that you're going to
have your fan on if we had the fan on
this side say for example like this we
wouldn't have room with this high
profile Ram so something you might want
to consider is going for a low profile
vengeance Ram kit rather than a high
profile one like this if you're going to
use an air cooling heatsink instead what
we're going to do is we're just going to
turn it around so our fan is going to be
right next to our exhaust fan right here
on the heatsink the good news is that
mounting this be quiet dark rock - is
quite simple all you do is position the
heatsink then you can actually squeeze
the back plate under the thermal are
more on the sabre-tooth which is kind of
neat because it holds it in place and
screw the four screws in from the back
then all that's left to do is mount the
fan to the heatsink using the included
clips plug the CPU fan connector into
the header on your motherboard and
you're done your heatsink is now mounted
next we're going to install the power
supply so you have the option of either
having the fan on the bottom of the
power supply or on the top but we're
going to go with the fan pointing down
this time around this case does have a
filtered intake down there so you don't
have to worry about it getting
completely clogged up with dust but the
main reason that we're going this route
versus the other way around is that it
looks like our cables are going to have
a little bit of trouble reaching the
very top where our eight pin CPU
connector is unless we install it this
way because the fixed cables on this
power supplied the 24 pin and the 8 pin
are going to be over on your right-hand
side my left if I install it with the
fan down to attach the power supply to
the case we simply use the four screws
that come in their own little baggie
that are threaded correctly for the back
of the power supply so now it's time to
start running some of the connectors so
we're going to start with the 24 pin
connector this provides most of the
power to your motherboard we get to go
through that nice cable
put a hole down there at the bottom
through this other nice cable management
hole up here at the top then we curve
around plug that bad boy in and we have
wired our 24 pin connector and a nice
neat tidy clean way next we've got our 8
pin connector which is also going to
route behind the motherboard tray so
it's going to go right through that
bottom spot there then is going to come
back up the there we go top left of the
motherboard tray and plug right into
that 8 pin connector up at the top left
this parts a little bit tricky so if you
can't get it yourself maybe get someone
with small hands to help you out with it
now this is the point in the build guide
where it's all about social networking
or making connection yeah making
connection connecting things that's what
I was looking for right connecting
things so we're going to start with our
front panel connectors USB 3 is a large
block of a connector usually blue very
thick very inflexible you want to run
that as close as you can to your front
USB 3 port which in the case of this
motherboard happens to be right angle
which is awesome meaning it's going to
look nice and tidy and you don't have to
have a big loop-de-loop next up
you've got front USB - these ones have a
small missing pin so it only goes in one
way plug that block into any of the USB
2 headers on your motherboard usually
there are a couple of them finally we've
got front panel audio front panel audio
usually has a couple of different
options HD and AC 97 this one only has
HD that's great because it's been a long
time since any motherboard required an
AC 97 pin out once again missing one
block in the pins so just plug that into
the front panel connector guys this is
the point in the build where don't be
shy about checking out the motherboard
manual to double-check where all of
these things are which leaves only the
front power button reset button and
power led to plug in now I normally show
you how to plug these in directly to the
board but because I'm a bit of a purist
but there is an easier way asus has what
they call their cue connector which
allows you to plug them all in easily
where you can see what you're doing
and then take that whole block and plug
it into the motherboard I still insist
on doing it the other way simply because
it makes the connector slightly more
low-profile so there's less chance of
them interfering with anything and I
personally think it looks better this
way but you have either option we've got
two drives to install one is a two and a
half inch SSD the other is a three and a
half inch hard drive we're going to opt
for using the lower of the drive bays
this is just to make cable management a
little bit more tidy and to mount our
SSD is very very simple you orient the
ports towards the back of the case the
side that we're not working from put in
at least a couple screws let's face it
it's a non-mechanical device it's not
like it's going to get broken if you
don't put in enough screws and then
slide the cage into place for the hard
drive the process is slightly more
complicated retrieve the sled we're
still using the same ones grab the
screws that have the spacer on them
because there are rubber grommets in the
sled position perfectly for three and a
half inch drives then orient the ports
towards the back of the case that we're
not working on screw all four in
securely remember this is a mechanical
device and then slide the sled into the
case those rubber grommets are going to
help prevent vibrations from being
passed from the drive to your case which
is going to make it operate much more
quietly now we've got to connect those
drives that we just added to the system
this power supplies modular though so
there's no SATA connectors attached to
it go into the usually a little baggie
or box inside your power supply box and
grab a dual SATA connector so this will
allow us with one cable harness to plug
in both drives you can plug the six pin
connector into any of the outlets on the
power supply itself as long as they are
the same so six pins then plug each of
the SATA power connectors into the back
of the drives once you're finished with
power grab a couple SATA data cables
these will be included in your
motherboard box I would recommend
one straight one and one right angle one
plug the other ends where they're both
straight into the motherboard then plug
the straight connector into the SSD and
the right angle connector into the hard
drive at the back as we get close to the
end you guys are probably starting to
notice that this is a really really tidy
looking build you can hardly see any
wires this is what great cable
management a well-thought-out build and
modular cables will do for you because
we're only going to plug in one more
modular cable harness and this is going
to allow us to get power to our fan
speed controller as well as the fans
that are integrated to the case we're
going to allow the asus motherboard to
control the CPU fan because it does a
really good job of that and it can be
controlled from within AI suite so all
we need to do now is plug the modular
connector into the power supply run it
through the back just like we've done
with all the other ones and we can power
all of the fans in this case simply by
plugging one molex connector into the
molex lead that comes out of the front
panel now at the back of the case
connecting our fans is simple we've only
got two fans in the case one at the back
one at the front so we take those leads
and plug them into ones that are coming
out of the front fan connector so
there's one short one I'd recommend
running that one to the front and there
are two long ones I recommend connecting
one of those to the back and you can use
that other one for something else in the
future should you desire may be an
additional front fan if you decide to
add that so close guys time for a little
bit of cable management now here's a
tech tip for you a lot of your
components are going to come with twist
ties I usually put those with the zip
ties that came with my case because it
gives me even more cable fasteners to
use some of the zip ties can be
particularly long and these are great
for when you want to take a nice big
bundle of cables take one of those
little hooks that are on the back of the
motherboard tray and then tie the whole
bundle together all in one place like so
because there's so much cable management
room on the back of the motherboard tray
and the define are for
don't have to worry too much about bulky
cables causing you to not be able to
close up the side panel once you are
done and now it's time to put that sexy
gtx 780 into your rig so find the top a
PCI Express slot PCIe 16 is the long
slot and remove the next two PCI slot
covers down for that
so that means removing the thumb screw
not letting the PCI bracket cover full
on to anything random cuz that might be
bad okay loosen the thumb screw and do
it again this time not letting it fall
that time I let the thumb screw fall
don't worry too much about this folks
don't worry we got this we're experts
here all right now you position the
graphics card with the PCI Express 16x
slot aligned with the PCI Express 16x
slot in your mother board make sure
everything is lined up correctly press
down firmly then all you have to do is
put those two thumb screws back in and
then once you're finished with the thumb
screws in much the same fashion as you
did before with your SATA drives as well
as your fan controller plug the two PCI
Express connectors into your power
supply run them up the back of the
motherboard tray bring them up to your
graphics card and plug one six pin
connector in so that's with the two
extra pins just left dangling and one
eight pin connector in to your graphics
card now it has all the power it needs
to deliver all that juicy 3d goodness
and there you have it guys if that's not
a gorgeous build then I don't know what
is it goes to show you how optimized
components as well as somewhat careful
assembly I mean we weren't totally
militant about the way that we did our
cable management but it goes to show you
how those things together can turn into
a very very nice looking rig that you'd
be proud to call your gaming machine but
not embarrassed to call your
professional workstation now performance
one of the most fun things about getting
a new computer
comparing it to your old one and going
yeah that's a lot better so I always
like to run some rudimentary benchmarks
just to see how much time I'm going to
be saving but I guess I'm wasting some
of it running the benchmarks don't worry
too much about that because we're
totting this machine not only as a
gaming machine so you might want to run
some 3dmark benchmarks or some built-in
benchmarks and some of your favorite
games but also as a workstation machine
we're going to run Cinebench which is a
free application for benchmarking and
that shows off the rendering prowess of
your computer so we're going to run the
cpu benchmark there not only can you
evaluate how much of an improvement you
got over your old system but also how
much of an improvement you got by
overclocking by turning our CPU up from
3.5 gigahertz which turbos up to 3.9
with one or two cores active all the way
up to 4.4 gigahertz on all cores all the
time we were able to get more than a 25%
performance improvement in Santa bench
which is going to be noticeable in the
real world and you're actually working
on things which I personally think is
incredibly cool and all of that is while
maintaining the silence of this machine
to the point where you pretty much have
to put your ear next to it in order to
hear the fans but what's performance
without efficiency has well offers
unprecedented sea States that is lower
power States for the CPU to the point
where this machine with a GTX 780 that's
a Titan based GPU so gk110 with a
Haswell 4770k so it's got your hyper
threading it's got your overclocking up
to 4.4 gigahertz idols at 55 watts drawn
from the wall that means the system is
actually consuming less than 50 watts
once you factor in the inefficiency of
the power supply converting AC to DC
power not only that but when we created
a load scenario that was completely
unrealistic running fir mark as well as
I does CPU tests we were only able to
draw a total of 465 Watts from the wall
that means the actual system power
consumption maxes out around 400 watts
remember when I said that 550 watt power
supply was going to be just fine in this
system there you go I
wouldn't exactly go and add another GTX
780 to it without upgrading the power
supply but you'll certainly be able to
do small incremental upgrades like maybe
a little bit more ram or a couple more
drives without any difficulty whatsoever
now all of that's fine and good so now
we've got power
and now we've got efficiency and
performance all that good stuff but what
about temperatures because silence
optimized is all fine and great but if
it's running really hot you're not going
to be comfortable with it even with our
overclock check this out running our
stress test we're running at 63 degrees
now this room's a little bit cool so
let's say maximum 70 degrees even if
you're in quite a warm room that is
pretty darn impressive your core i7
4770k is going to perform great and
lasts for a long time with those kinds
of temperatures in this kind of
environment I hope you guys have enjoyed
