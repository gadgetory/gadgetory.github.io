gigabyte actually a really exciting
board from gigabyte this has a whole
bunch of really cool stuff that I'm
super excited about and I want to
preface this whole unboxing video by
saying this looks like it might be the
board for me I'm on in the still in the
middle of doing my my personal rig
upgrade and I'm super excited about this
board ultra durable five ultra cool
ultra efficient ultra performance and
high current capability so they have
completely redesigned their vrm designs
above their arm design yes redesigned
their design industry-leading 60 amp
rated power stage with lower losses
higher efficiency and excellent thermal
management what this means to me is that
in previous almost everyone's x79 boards
because there's so little room to build
the vrm you have to use really high
quality components to deliver the kind
of current low CPUs demand almost all of
them made like whining obnoxious noises
so gigabyte has just revamped it
completely to the point where they're
saying yep this is awesome it's the best
we are gonna put a five-year warranty on
this in the US and Canada and you know
they're just basically like I wish I had
sunglasses okay
kevrah been true I wish I had sunglasses
so I could like put them on like this it
was really yeah that's pretty much what
they're doing at this point so let's uh
let's finish up with the rest of the box
so this is the X 79 s up5 this is using
the Intel chipset C 606 so they're using
the official e-z on supporting xeon
grade chipset comes with you know let's
not talk too much about accessories
include say three power so digital power
for the CPU and for each of the memory
channels or not for each of the memory
channels for each of the sets of memory
channels are worldwide number one
digital desktop TM provider okay so
they're actually giving you the brand of
the power components they're using very
cool so the 3d bios a UEFI bios with but
back up like physical back up SAS
onboard ECC memory support so this is
more like a workstation
really than just a desktop board this is
not like your Grandpa's desktop board
cool power inside notes a single package
design the industry-leading 60 amp rated
power stage high side MOSFET low side
MOSFET all on a single package - check
this out so they're saying compared to
traditional or even lower RDS on MOSFETs
which their competitors are still
talking about the IR 355 power IR stage
power ear stage oh wow that's hilarious
runs cooler and delivers more power same
thing here
cooler temps equals high and a higher
overclocks and this is for a couple of
reasons the number one is that your vrm
components will perform better when
they're running cooler number two is
that when all these components down here
career when all these components around
the outside of the CPU socket are hot it
doesn't really make your CPU run hotter
and I think that's pretty much it so
they still got there two times copper
PCB which basically mounts the better
cooling better conduction and let's get
the board open I am just super stoked to
check this out motherboard itself opened
up oh I love what gigabytes been doing
with their motherboard color schemes
since pretty much P 67 matte black okay
you know what hold on hold on they're
gonna do accessories first we'll just
blow through these because I really want
to check out the board so here's their
PCI Express Wi-Fi Bluetooth module this
is a great value at because you can not
only install it in your gigabyte board
but you can also just install it in some
other computer if you don't plan to use
wireless in your gaming PC so yes they
haven't locked it down the way that a
seuss does with a lot of their add-on
then check that out matte black PCB on
this - way to go gigabyte figuring out
the details and getting it done same
thing
flexible black crossfire and sli bridges
perfect black antennas for the Bluetooth
and Wi-Fi perfect
whatever this cable connects to it's
black and it's perfect we've got 6 SATA
3 6 gigabit per second connections our
cables we've got a front three and a
half inch Bay that you can use to hook
up a couple of USB 3 ports if you don't
have if you don't have that
functionality
built-in here case you've got 3-way SLI
bridge included so this board is 3-way
SLI and crossfire compatible matte black
of course gorgeous I think this might be
the best overall package that gigabytes
ever done on a motherboard ever and
gigabyte can take that feedback right
back to their age too because I have
unboxed almost every gigabyte
motherboard in the last few years I Oh
shield color-coded but not too
color-coded see it's not overdone
perfect manual was a driver disk down
with the latest manual for the wireless
thing something multilingual
okay accessories are done we're good
we're done we're moving on to the good
part so let's check out this board this
is not quite an ATX board this is an e
ATX board but it's not quite EA TX
either it's just a touch wider than ATX
so if you have an ATX case that's a
little bit on the wide side this should
fit just fine you've got the motherboard
socket this is an LGA 2011 socket
supporting Intel Core i7 up to extreme
edition processors with quad channel
memory you've got eight banks of memory
on here so that means you can with eight
gig games you can stop up to 64 gigs of
memory no problem although you know ECC
does start to become something you might
want when you have that much RAM fully
supported on this particular board your
8 pin power connector is in its ideal
location at the top of the board I
wouldn't mind it seeing it a little bit
over here but I understand why they've
done this because it's right behind the
PWM and then right next to the CPU
socket so they've gone for a very
efficient layout in terms of not
overdoing you know extra random traces
that it takes to you know carry the
power over here through here so
efficiency is what it's all about with
this particular board on board power
switch is up here on the top right and
it's ideal location 24-pin power
connectors on the right-hand edge in its
ideal location I wouldn't have minded
seeing this USB 3 front panel header on
a right angle but other than that not
bad not bad now check this out look at
all these connectors holy smokes so
you've got 2 Intel powered SE 2 3 6
gigabit per second connectors you've got
4 Intel powered 2 a 2 to 3 gigabit per
second connectors and eight SAS six
gigabit per second connectors so that is
a total of 14
say that poor SATA ports on this board
so you can fill up pretty much any case
that you can put this board in with hard
drives without worrying about a darn
thing dual BIOS right here so you have
two physical bios's here's your onboard
reset switch wouldn't mind in seeing
that sort of up here with the power
switch but not the end of the world
front panel connectors
that's your super charging you know
high-powered USB 2.0 front panel header
so that will allow you to charge your
iPad off of it extra current to regular
USB to front panel headers to trusted
platform module front firewire front
audio and moving right along you got
your PCI Express layout so even though
this is an e HDX board usually x79
boards go for an XL ATX longer form
factor if they're going to try and
squeeze in seven slots and gigabyte has
gone with six slots for this board but
you're still gonna have full 3-way video
card compatibility one two three so
that'll run ins probably sixteen eight
oh you know what let me find out the sec
so I knocked out because they're using
that C 606 chipset rather than a regular
desktop chipset that's where all your
SAS connectivity is coming from so those
are actually powered off the Intel
chipset and remember guys you do need a
Xeon if you want to run ECC registered
DIMMs or anything like that so bear that
in mind okay so back to the PCI Express
slot layout you're going to be running
at 16 8 X 8 X so they have not opted for
a PL x chip and there's actually a good
reason for that so these are pcie 3.0
ports which means they've got lots of
bandwidth even if you're throwing a few
gtx 680 s in here
what it also means is there's less
latency running through switches even if
they're switches that increase the
overall bandwidth being delivered to the
slot can increase the latency and can
actually reduce performance in isolated
cases so as long as you're delivering at
least 8x to the card ax PCI III is
equivalent to to the 16 X PCIe - then
you're not concerned about not having
enough bandwidth and it's better to not
have the additional latency so there you
go so oh yeah ok so what do I think of
the overall layout so once you install
one 16x card here you're going to be
left with 3 PCIe 16x physical slots 8 X
8 X this one is actually wired for 4x
and a PCI slot this gives you a pretty
good mix you know you want to throw in
like your legacy sound card maybe you
got an older like awesome tech Expo
Radian or whatever you know really good
sound card then you got a few more PCIe
expansion slots sounds good I'm really
fill in the back of the board using all
metal screws I'm glad we've gotten
completely away from plastic pushpins
more cooling on the back so pairing this
up with a case like an eleven hundred or
something like that would be great
because you'll get a little bit of
additional cooling with that fan built
into the back of that case and your back
i/o one two three four five six yes five
six USB 2.0 ports ps2 port clear CMOS OC
button as well as BIOS changer okay
this is a USB eSATA combo port this is
an eSATA port this is firewire 2 Gigabit
Ethernet one running off the Intel
chipset and one running off a real tech
third-party chipset optical audio out
7.1 audio and I think that pretty much
covers it so I'm just gonna do a little
spiel on why this is perfect for me it
has the absolutely perfect color scheme
I really don't like the powder blue that
one of gigabytes competitors is using
for accents I also really love the
overall subdued matte just aw
performance look that they've got with
these boards great cooling solution so
this right here actually isn't really
attached to anything this is just
additional cooling for the chipset as
well as due to the connection by heat
pipes the vrm up here so they've gone
with sort of a traditional layout where
normally on most motherboards you'd find
additional vrm components and cooling
here but they've just put the cooling
over here and they've connected
everything with heat pipes to move it
around
I love the just the size of it it's not
XL ATX which means that you've got
compatibility with almost every case out
there with the exception of very very
narrow very cramped cases where you
won't have that extra room and it's
gigabyte quality I mean honestly is
there really anything else to say
whether it's gigabyte or whether it's
you know any other of the big three you
know the real guys who are actually
designing and building these things from
the ground up manufacturing them and
testing them yeah you can pretty much
trust it I think that
is pretty much it guys thank you for
