nos that all our editors used to edit 4k
8k video and the like it's completely
full Newton server the mechanical based
vault where we store all our old
projects that's completely full - and to
make matters worse our new red weapon
camera capable of recording footage at a
whopping 8k resolution is also here and
capable of filling up its 1 terabyte
Meg's at a rate of up to 300 megabytes
per second yes a 3 second clip that
could be as much as 1 gig fortunately
Seagate oh there go the rails you might
say this projects gotten off the rails
already fortunately Seagate and 45
drives have partnered up with us which
means they gave us hardware to solve
this problem once and for all
today
we are installing a petabyte of storage
in our freshly renovated server room so
come along for the ride
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel they're the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description hey guys so would it
be a problem if I shut down the vault
for a couple hours the vault could I
shut that down for a couple hours lock
it down
oh good look who we are the key burn
Burnett's don't know don't you know why
don't we even talk to you people on TSN
games you brought more around it I like
this guy
so I guess now's a good opportunity to
introduce our friends from 45 drives so
this is Bret Kelly who is what what
exactly I'm an electrical engineer ok
education and I've been while doing just
a little bit everything since I got 45
cars and then this is Nicole whose last
name I forget Morrison horses yes good
you got it yeah I look after the
marketing ok so here we go I did manage
to at least open the top of the box that
is as far as I got yeah as far as look
at that documentation that I ruined okay
so you guys have made some significant
changes to the story inator since the
last time that I got my hands on one yes
now it has a screen it has a screen oh
no I'm not doing that it's yours okay I
got this ah yes
it's stuck it's stuck there you go yes
let's see what happens if I unscrew
these without oh yeah that was fun bitch
hey I drop things all the time I got to
be good at catching them so now you guys
have like a tool list mechanism for the
drives now instead of that well it was
toolless before but it was kind of like
a dumb tool list now it's like a really
smart tool list cool so it's like a
friction mount and in terms of oh wow it
looks like it did get a little bit
winged and shipping there look at that
Oh guess who might just have to take a
hammer to it nervous chuckle send it -
can you not hammer our expensive survey
machine well no there we go okay so
what's in here so we've got our two
rocket carts rocket 750 made by
highpoint yep they may connect on to the
LCD screen there we have a two-port
Intel 10 gigabit nic rj45 copper okay 64
gigs of ram soon to be 128 and a much
more high efficient power supply than
the one you had last time okay cool yeah
find the rest sorry wait in your boot a
couple of screws fell into my boob so
with our introductions and the unboxing
out of the way it's time for the most
exciting part inventory time so you
might actually be wondering why we need
so much ram and the answer to that
question is brett on his way over here
stopped and doubled up our memory
because basically ZFS as you add more
and more storage to it we're going to be
putting about 400 terabytes of storage
in each of these boxes uses ram as sort
of like a like a map to where the data
is so that's why all of a sudden we went
from 64 gigs being perfectly acceptable
to really wanting 128 gigs so we're
going to have that much in each of our
systems
oh did you cut yourself oh that's uh
that happened fast we've already got
first blood already an injury nice a
nice knuckle one too so it's always an
awkward band-aid right
oh man and it takes forever to heal I
know I was going out I'll go well it'll
go away no see this is why techies don't
like sharing their screwdrivers I'm
putting these screws in by hand well
this guy over here yeah you know what no
fine don't just keep it just keep just
keep it oh I'll damn it I can't even
find it yeah yay okay so this sucks
there's some shipping damage on our
server so we're gonna have to fix that
before we go move to the fun part of
loading it into the server rack it's
like I'm sure proto cases like
metalworking engineers are rolling in
their graves they're not even dead yet
they're rolling in their graves watching
me work on metal so I look pretty pretty
straight right there
yeah that's right see I may not be good
at doing things properly but I'm good at
doing things the crappy way now you
might be thinking to yourself gee Linus
this server sure doesn't have a lot of
hard drives in it to which I would reply
maybe I am the hard drive and then
everyone would groan and cringe and all
that and then I would give you the real
response which is we're not ready to put
the hard drives in yet because these
Excel 60-story Nader's can way freaking
what like a hundred pounds probably with
sixty drives in them yeah you do not
want to move these around full so we're
gonna go ahead and we're gonna install
the drives once they're already on the
rails as we switch jobs assignment I was
defeated before were you yeah oh I
didn't notice
oh here yeah I couldn't have ourselves
yeah there we go
there we go yeah we're working this
snake together so you didn't feel dirty
until I said that did it so yeah so you
pull and I feet there we go I get how
this works good wait no that's not right
no what's going on with you in this
backwards this is my end are you sure I
know what the problem is goes this way
really okay and now we've got it
backwards
you were the fuller there we go hey I'm
glad we got this sorted out I mean I
don't get them all straight though it's
way easier this time I'd have hated for
this to get embarrassing when you're me
you got to learn to be real good at
catching okay this is starting to worry
me now a little bit this water-cooled
server has to move to the bottom of the
rack in the event that there's a leak
the last thing we want to do too is new
$50,000 worth of enterprise-grade
Seagate hard drives not to mention the
story inators I actually want to move
these existing story readers up to put
petabyte project at the very bottom
networking cables here heavy hard drives
here as I like them bottom heavy baby
you've seen my wife I clearly don't like
them hot heavy
like he thinks he's here to install
petabyte project he's actually just
helping me to server room maintenance I
got this side yeah I got as much of this
song as I can oh look at that that's not
so been good server room crap with Linus
and Brett use the bottom server as a
shelf for the top server no problem
so update time we have Delta 1 and Delta
2 servers deployed we've got our network
configuration all set up or running sent
to s and it is time now to load in one
petabyte of hard drives oh you know what
let's just take one box at a time is
first drugs going in here it goes oh
that's a tight fit there there we go oh
that's in ok so now we just got to do
that uh 97 more times
here we go I guess it gets less exciting
after the first couple yeah
really I turned my back for like five
second rule-- sis five seconds okay
let's just let's just get this stupid
thing out of here I'll figure out how to
get it taped on their property lit
properly later okay okay so hold on
let's go all the way back let's start at
the beginning okay so all the drives are
in we're ready to fire it up so first we
take our hard drives and we separate
them into V devs that's correct then we
take those V devs and we combined them
into is that I fast pools yeah and the
beautiful thing is it's all one command
it does it for us we just tell it what
we want to build okay then we take those
pools and we divide them up into bricks
and then bricks we use to build up our a
cluster FS cluster filesystem you got it
so bluster handles the scaling the ZFS
layer handles the devices failure all
that fun stuff so with cluster then we
could add more store Nader's to have
more than a petabyte of data or we could
add two more identical story inators and
we could have redundancy yeah okay let's
get started
so it looks like we might have a bunk
drive ok so we'd found the device that's
spitting out errors it's this guy right
here
so what we're going to do just a basic
troubleshooting step is we're going to
swap it with a drive that is working
vice SDA q again so that's the slot that
cable would be bad
that'd be really bad
like that is our farthest so you're
thinking hard right now it turns out I
don't have the right cards here to throw
in a replacement if the card is bad but
honestly that to me looks not as much
like a card issue and more like a
connection issue so what we haven't
tried yet it's just a simple unplug and
plug back in at the HBA level once I
just pop them all pop them all back in
or oh no you know which one it is okay
we got it
s da Q is back so the solution was we
actually have a port on the card that
was kind of bunk but the good news is
these are what uh ten port so these are
40 Drive cards so we moved everything
over one everything's up and running
we're ready to rock okay whew I thought
for a minute there Seagate was going to
have a bad drive in their sponsored
video where 45 drives was gonna have a
bad port on their on their case in their
sponsored video or natum in 40 yeah
hilarious yeah
ro a three point eight gigabytes 3.8
gigabytes per second check that out
count all the places kids three billion
eight hundred and two million two
hundred thirty two kilobytes per second
windows reports even after all the space
lost to ZFS to redundancy to Gluster to
solar flares 778 terabytes of storage so
we have effectively more than quadrupled
the old space on the vault which by the
way was like super done like super duper
done for the file move test file Ariella
and gigabyte file yeah baby those are
spinners so let's read off it back to a
back to a hardware raid are you ready
so we're reading at a consistent one
gigabyte per second absolutely gorgeous
so there you have it we're all done

one
thank you for coming out it works
reasonably well not as well as my new
one but thank you man
you're very welcome so I guess that's
how it works we just we trade a petabyte
for a used KVM switch that's right it is
the greatest person ever eight porch VGA
VGA I'll get you some cables too I don't
think I can give you all eight cables
