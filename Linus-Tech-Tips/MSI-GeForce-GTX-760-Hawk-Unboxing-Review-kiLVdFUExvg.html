limited edition t-shirt and in-game
items for planetside 2 click now to
learn more now I know there's been a lot
of high-end graphics card stuff lately
and we focused a lot on $500 $600 cards
that most people can't afford now it's
time to come back to reality so with the
recent price drops especially gtx760 s
are looking pretty appealing and I can't
think of many that are better than MSI's
Hawk Edition so its clocked at 1.17 6
gigahertz it's got 2 gigs of 6 gigahertz
gddr5 memory just like pretty much any
other gtx 760 would and it has a very
unique implementation as we've come to
expect from Hawke cards over the last
several years so let's go ahead and get
this baby opened up and find out what's
inside so first we've got some
accessories which hopefully I can figure
out better actually open here there we
go so there's a quick users guide as
well as a disc that you should throw
away a DVI to vga adapter that you
should throw away the checkpoint
connectors so those are for checking
actual voltages right on the PCB using
the v checkpoints as well as apparently
a guide and some oh cool these are handy
to 6 pin to 8 pin PCI Express adapters
those are going in the handy stuff bin
after this all right so after that we
have the card itself so it supports all
the standard gtx 760 stuff so GPU boost
2.0 dynamically adjusting the clocks
according to power thresholds
temperature thresholds and making sure
that the fan speed stays under control
game stream which is with any kepler
card the ability to stream your games
from your PC to an Nvidia shield or to
well to an Nvidia shield or through your
TV our to your TV through an Nvidia
shield so that's game stream and shadow
play which uses the onboard h.264
encoder to record your games locally or
stream to twitch TV with almost no
performance hit although it should be
noted that not all games are supported
yada yada etc etc but it's a great way
to stream games as long as they are
supported versus having there be a huge
performance drop alright
so let's talk about the cooler right
there my friends are to 100 millimeter
fans with their propeller blades so they
have that smoother plastic on the
outside they spin the other way upon
startup to pull dust out of that massive
cooler so that's actually a five heat
pipe cooler there's four of them that
come out at the bottom so you can see
those four down there and then there's
an additional super pipe on the top so
that's an eight millimeter heat pipe
that carries heat as far away from the
GPU core as it possibly can towards the
back of the card they are claiming it
runs up to ten degrees Celsius cooler
and up to around sixteen decibels
quieter and while we were able to
validate that it does run dramatically
cooler than a reference card we don't
have a decibel meter unfortunately so we
weren't able to validate that it runs
quieter but it does run extremely
quietly so I wouldn't be concerned about
this card being loud on the top you find
two eight pin PCI Express connectors I
would go ahead and say that that's
probably totally unnecessary but that
does in theory allow this card to draw
more power therefore delivering more
power to the GPU and other components
and in theory overclock better in fact
we did get a slightly better overclock
out of the GTX 760 hot compared to our
reference card which you'll see in the
overclocking results and benchmarks at
the end of this video on the back of the
card we find a backplate I kind of I
kind of you know was not that sold on
back plates for a while but I think I've
started liking them again they look
quite nice and this is kind of a first
for MSI is the first time I've seen it
but a matte black PCB the PCB on this
card is absolutely gorgeous we've seen a
lot of dark brown PCBs trying to pass
for black PCBs from MSI and that is not
what they've done here there's a bio
switch right here that goes from
standard mode to liquid-nitrogen mode
depending on what kind of crazy
benchmarking you're doing on it and
they've completely redesigned the entire
PCB so it has a six plus two phase power
design that is to say six phases for the
GPU itself two phases for the RAM and
nothing left of the original reference
design it's got a PCI Express 3.0 16 X
connector down here it has two sli
fingers at the top supporting up to
3-way SLI and then over on the i/o side
you've got two DVI ports HDMI and
DisplayPort so that's full support for
Nvidia 3d vision surround with one
additional auxiliary display it uses
military
at class four components so that means
driver MOSFETs so that's a driver and
MOSFET in one unit and then they've also
got their copper MOSFETs for hat faster
dissipation
hi-c caps and finally their dark caps
which are aluminum capacitors they're
cleaning up to a 10-year lifespan or
something ridiculous like that software
wise it supports their triple over
voltage feature so you know they have a
few cards that they kind of slip under
the nvidia green light sort of you know
blanket of not not too much over volting
and all that stuff so you can over volt
the GPU the ram as well as the PLL so
you can really fine tune your overclock
and that's all supported through MSI
Afterburner which around here at Linus
tech tips is our favorite NVIDIA GeForce
graphics card overclocking utility
remember you can use MSI Afterburner
on any graphics card as long as it
doesn't have a weird vrm solution that's
not supported by it so not just on MSI
cards although if you want to support
the guys that build great utilities then
you might want to buy it in a Sai card
so that you know that all those good
things can happen alright so performance
we used our standard test bench with our
six core processor 12 gigs or 16 16 gigs
of ram I think are running on it these
days some SSD and anyway here are the
benchmark results so you can see here
that our 760 Hawke Edition does slightly
outperform our standard card all of this
while in my personal opinion looking
absolutely fantastic being extremely
quiet and running extremely cool we only
ran a few games because there's not
really a whole lot to say about it it
should be noted guys that we do
overclock all of our cards so at stock
this card will outperform the reference
card by a little bit more but once you
overclock both of them the gap does tend
to narrow a little bit if you aren't
doing anything extreme on the cooling
side or the overclocking tweaking and
tuning side remember guys overclocking
is always luck of the draw so there's no
guarantee that your Hawke will overclock
better than a standard card or that your
standard card will overclock at all but
it tends to be that the better designed
cards with beefier vrm and more power
and all that stuff do you tend to
overclock a little bit better one more
thing I missed here at the back of the
card those are those v checkpoints so
you can actually check the exact
voltages of various components with a
multimeter rather than relying on
software tools and I think that is
pretty much it thank you for checking
