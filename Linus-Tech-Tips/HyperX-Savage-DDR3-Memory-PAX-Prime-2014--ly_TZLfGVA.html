guys welcome to one of our last videos
at PAX Prime my voice is pretty shot at
this point so hopefully doesn't crack
anywhere throughout the video they've
launched savage memory RAM here this is
their new line replacing their Genesis
line of RAM which is actually really
really good-looking memory its Duyck it
has diecast heatsink modules which have
then been diamond-cut and fit on to the
black PCB that they're running so it
will go really really well with your
black and red themed builds you get
these in kits of up to 32 gigabytes in
speeds of up to 2400 megahertz and
encash latencies of around cl9 it also
is low profile memory so if you're
running something like a knock to an HD
14 you'll should be fine I haven't done
any size testing myself but they do look
quite short so I'm pretty sure they'll
fit under there you would have to get
the 2011 kit but I believe that comes
stocked with in HD 14s now anyways also
here at the booth there have been
overclocking it and I have seen the
fastest memory personally so far here at
the event of 3300 maegor's that was
booted earlier today right now we're
having a little bit more problems but
it's a new and kind of rough platform
it'll it'll it'll mature later on down
the line we'll see much higher
overclocks down the line but that's
pretty impressive for thus far HyperX at
PAX 2014 pretty much as you covered in
terms of memory with predator on ddr4
and savage on ddr3 you have two brand
new lines memory launched and with their
overclocking going on here if you were
live at the event that was pretty sick
