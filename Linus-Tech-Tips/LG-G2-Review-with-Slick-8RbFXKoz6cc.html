really late review of the LG g2 first
we'll start off with tech specs so as a
5.2 inch 1080p IPS screen a 13 megapixel
camera on the back a 2.2 6 skijor its
quad core Snapdragon 800 which makes my
s3 look like a Tonka truck at 3000
milliamp hour battery 32 gigabytes of
storage which only about I think 22 to
24 gigabytes is usable I believe and 2
gigabytes of 800 megahertz Ram next
we're moving to physical features so it
comes in kind of a nasty gloss mine
specifically comes in black which I'll
hopefully cover up with a case as soon
as possible unlike the models in Korea
it does not have a removable back
removable battery or interchangeable SD
card slot other than that there's the
kind of tinny speakers which my hands
seemed to cover when I actually watch it
in portrait mode which is unfortunate
because you're essentially manually
muting the device but I've gotten used
to kind of holding it really wide so I
don't cover the actual speakers but it
is kind of odd other than that just
around the the sides of the device
there's no buttons and there's no
buttons on the front either which was
really weird at first and I honestly
really hated it and expected I was not
gonna like the phone at all but there's
buttons on the back which I didn't like
at first but then I noticed that that's
kind of where my finger naturally rest
my finger naturally rests right on the
buttons on the back and it's really easy
to tell what button you're pressing so
once I got used to that I noticed that
there's the double tap on feature for
the screen so you can turn the screen on
by just double tapping the screen and if
you're able to double tap a blank area
on your desktop it will turn the screen
off so if your phone is resting on a
table you can double tap the screen to
turn it on double tap the screen to turn
it off and you don't have to access the
buttons on the back and if the button if
the phone is not resting on a table you
can just press the buttons on the back
easily because your hand is naturally in
that position and I actually really like
this feature after using the phone for
quite a while it feels awkward to use a
different phone now to press the buttons
on the side feels weird whenever I go to
press the button on the side I tend to
press more than one and adjust things
that I don't want to adjust and this
just feels better now if the phone's in
my pocket I can reach down into my
pocket change the volume or do whatever
really easily as I'll always know where
the buttons are
as if they're at the top that means the
top one is volume up if they're at the
bottom that means the top one is volume
down it's just really simple and I like
it a lot I hope this feature transcends
on two phones in the future so that once
I replace this phone I can get this
feature again that's how much I do like
it now speaking about hoping this
feature might be on future phones my
future phone might actually be this
phone my contract is ending was Telus
very soon and I'm gonna have to pick up
another phone it's honestly probably
gonna be this one I really like the
buttons on the back and speaking of
Telus Thank You Telus forgiving Android
bugle this phone Android beagle is a
Canadian publication talking about
mobile stuff and they were nice enough
to give us this phone to review and to
give away so we'll be giving away by
having you guys comment on the video
below include somewhere in your comment
Android bugle whether or not it's like
thanks Android people or something like
that that'll all work as long as you
have Android bugle in it I will be able
to find it more easily and also circle
them on Google+ if you do both those two
things comment on the video below with
something to do with the Android bugle
and circle them on Google+ you'll be
entered into the into the draw to win
that phone the LG g2 more about the back
buttons so if you hold the volume up
button on the back down while the screen
is off it will open up the notes
application quickly and just jump you
right into there if you hold the volume
down button down while the screen is off
it'll open the camera application and
having your hand already back there
makes it fairly easy to take pictures in
portrait mode and will enable you to
take pictures just by pressing that
button again and speaking of the camera
it's actually pretty awesome it as
optical image stabilization a pretty
sweet sensor and tons of photo options
as you guys probably know I'm not
exactly the greatest at taking photos so
I'm gonna get Brandon here to actually
take the photos so you guys can see some
examples of how good this camera is I
personally have just been using it to
take super cheesy photos of my food
although I have not been instagramming
them or posting them online so don't
worry about that the 3000 milliamp hour
battery with a combination of the
efficiency of the Snapdragon 800 is
pretty impressive as a story of how good
this battery is and this was probably
one of the the best cases I could have
possibly been in was at CES when I was
using the phone quite heavily I forgot
to charge it one night now I was staying
up for
20 hours a day at this point and using
it quite consistently throughout the
entire day used it for one day forgot to
charge it overnight use it for the
entire next day and as I was laying down
to go to bed it finally gave me a
warning saying that I only have 15% to
my battery life left meaning it worked
for two entire extended days of fairly
medium to heavy use without dying I
still had a little bit of juice left
that was awesome because I was able to
completely forget about charging it and
completely get through the whole next
day without having to worry about
carrying a battery pack around or
anything like that the phone is running
Android 4.2 software and on top of that
it's running LG's Optimus UI currently
I've used TouchWiz sense for a little
while and now Optimus UI when you first
start using optimus UI it's a little bit
clunky there's a bunch of animations and
the animations are fairly long now let's
snap dragon 800 makes the animations run
exactly how long they should be and not
really lag but they still take a little
while and seem a little bit unnecessary
and some things are just a little bit
messy luckily it's fairly customizable
you can change a lot of things and after
spending a while with it I found that I
was able to turn it into something that
I didn't mind that much the only thing I
don't really like right now is the
notification drawer that is still pretty
messy and I'm hoping that I can fix that
up in the next little while because I'm
not actually a huge fan of it but the
rest of the whole experience I have been
able to change to my liking quite well
thank you for watching my video on the
LG g2 don't forget to comment below with
something to do with Android bugle and
do you like the buttons on the back or
do you still want buttons on the side I
know I like the buttons on the back but
that might not be the same for everyone
I might suit your style a lot better to
have the buttons on the side so what do
you think also don't forget to circle
Android bugle on Google+ because you
need to do that to be eligible for the
contest as well as always thumbs up or
thumbs down based on what the weather is
