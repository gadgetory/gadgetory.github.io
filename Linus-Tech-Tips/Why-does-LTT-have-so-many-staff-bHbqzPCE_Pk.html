of times over the years and I don't know
I guess no shoot just tripped over uh
just tripped over a monitor there
actually I'm really excited I finally
upgraded the monitor in my office today
so hopefully there's nothing
incriminating on the screen ah yes the
new 49 inch ultra wide 1440p resolution
anyway that's not the point of today's
video I've been asked a lot of times
over the years you guys just make
youtube videos why do you have so many
people on staff because with our new
wave of hiring we are going actually to
be up to I think it's 26 does anyone
know like how many people are gonna be
here soon 22 plus seven is that no it
can't be it can't be 29 okay anyway the
point is with the new wave of hiring
we're gonna be up to over 25 people here
at Linus Media Group and that doesn't
even count flow plane so I've had a lot
of people say well you just make youtube
videos well what else do you do and in
response to that question I've never I
don't think I've ever actually answered
that question publicly cuz I just didn't
really I didn't really see the point but
that is that is all we do yes we're not
a system integrator we're not a retailer
we are just just a youtube channel but
actually multiple YouTube channels so we
do I think more work than I think some
of you realize so aside from Linus tech
tips which does six normal uploads per
week and by normal uploads I would say
like our Monday to Thursday and then
Saturday Sunday content plus when show
so that's seven videos plus any extra
releases so we define an extra release
as something that's not part of our
regular one video everyday programming
where we're doing like a sponsored
showcase or something like that that we
just didn't think was a standalone
release so we'll do that as an extra
slot on Friday or sometimes as an extra
spot on midnight on a weekday or
something along those lines or we'll do
it in the standard slot and then we'll
move what would have been that day's
video to midnight or whatever the case
may be
so so we do seven videos a week plus
sending extra sponsored stuff on - tech
tips we do three videos a week over on
tech linked which Riley is actually kind
of the point man for that channel so
that's we're up to ten now then we do
another two to three on tech quickie so
that's 12 to 13 videos a week and then
plus we do have some although I don't
I'm I'm hesitant to even count it
because it's very little we do have some
video production work that we do so if
you work in retail at Best Buy for
example you might have seen this lovely
face or Luke's actually on the the boost
which is like an educational thing for
retail associates so we've done that for
Intel we have some stuff coming for
Sabourin for like their product pages
and stuff I think I'm allowed to talk
about that anyway so here's what I'm
gonna do right so we do like almost 15
videos a week which is actually a lot of
work believe it or not like go make a
video so you know that's basically we
only have like one point three people
per video that we make a week that seems
pretty reasonable right rather oh yeah
yeah so we're gonna go through one by
one I'm gonna try and keep an eye on the
questions that you guys post here in the
chat so if you guys have some like great
questions for people but I basically
want everyone to tell me three things
that they do like why why do we need you
to make videos oh man ok so I write tech
linked I write every tech linked episode
except for Mondays which usually John
writes I host tech linked and some
Alliance tech tips now as well and oh
that seems like more than three and I
write and I write Linus tech tip videos
there you go so that's what Riley does
cool good job Riley
Anthony three things you do so Anthony
is on our writing staff
I sit here okay that's one yes you do do
that
I write things yep and I benchmark yes
Anthony also does some of our server and
network admin he also does some of our
live streaming overseeing so he and Jake
are the ones that know how the live
streaming cart works and all that kind
of thing he's he's under selling his
importance a little bit but that's sort
of Anthony's way he's kind of an
understated kind of guy if we want the
polar opposite of that why don't we talk
to James Wow
Jimmy make our videos watchable Wow okay
what do you want yeah there's three
things three things you do here I write
I sometimes appear on camera for tech
length wine shows maybe tech quickie
increasing the LTTE and another random
project like sponsor stuff and events
like the roast yeah yeah right the roast
roast is a big deal so James has
actually been instrumental in making
that thing happened
we haven't actually given you guys a ton
of details about the roast but it's next
Friday if you're in the Vancouver area
by the way we're gonna talk about this
online show but we will actually have
tickets for sale I believe they're super
cheap do you know what the ticket prices
are I think it's like 10 bucks or
something basically we're only charging
for it to make sure that we don't get a
bunch of people committing to be there
and then they don't show up we just want
to we just want to fill seats with
enthusiastic butts actually it's a
really good time to subscribe to
floatplane if you haven't already
James just reminded me that we were
planning to livestream the roast to flow
plane and if there's anything too
controversial that will get cut from the
YouTube release I personally guarantee
it so if you want to see the uncut
version you're gonna want to be
subscribed to flow play oh yeah it'll be
like way later way later for the cut
down version Alex what's three things
that you do here hi I I drink coffee I
have some Tim's right here thank you
I spend lots of money on tools
if we've got a set of Kaulitz here that
I'm trying to decide on what the best
course of action is there but uh we all
know more a much more expensive thing
that's uh we only you only have one
course of action press by now like did
that wait maybe make sure it's right
first
yeah it's but that's not necessarily
what we want cuz I don't think that we
want like these call us we want the ones
that you can change it more easier bit
pricier but what else do you have even
spend money um I rake videos
one such generic answers I should just
answer for everyone yeah what do I do -
okay so Alex as he never actually
completed his program but as an
engineering major at some point in
another life is our go-to guy when ever
we need to create something from scratch
so he's really been the driving force
behind our sleeper builds behind
anything that's been created sort of
ground up from scratch materials
he's our CNC wizard and that that's I'd
say really his sort of unique value add
he also does the vast majority of our
laptop and system reviews yeah that's on
all right like the ar-15 here just
reviewed it it's pretty good
yeah actually that should be that should
be a good video if I also got this is
gonna be cool so Mac Mini versus PC Mini
coming so Mac Mini quad core processor
PC mini a core Mac Mini does this even
is this onboard graphics yep onboard
graphics KC Mini 1080 it's gonna be a
little one-sided I think Jake's not at
his are they about the same price yeah
yikes
how much Jake's not at his desk but Jake
is sort of our second in command maker
and then he also had a little man what
does he do he he takes up a ton of space
he works on like kind of our weird
projects he does something kind of
specialty builds like the copper build
that he somehow talked me into letting
him keep as a workstation you
three different slots of dick but he 3d
prints a lot of crap including this
laptop stand over here which I was like
on work time he's like yep I'm like okay
so even though he's technically not a
millennial I'd say he's the most
millennial person on our staff that's
that's he's not here to defend himself
so I guess that's uh
I get I get the last word Lloyd is gonna
accompany us back to his desk and he's
gonna explain what the devil it is that
he does are actually launching one of
his creations today yeah I can bring
your thing okay you're not gonna bring
it okay okay too excited to show off
your latest latest insanity now I'm sure
I'm gonna leak something that Nick's
gonna be mad at me for but um there's
not much we can do pretty much
everything in Lloyds area is like
strictly confidential but this isn't so
there's four different designs in
different colors and it's gonna be it's
gonna be sold as a 4-pack I can give you
more detail on that later but the
purpose of this dream is to justify
every person who works here so everyone
I'm going around and I'm asking for
three things that you do why do we need
25 people here I know why do we yeah I
just I do much is a really awesome yeah
okay he does other things too so he
coordinates communication with Chinese
suppliers actually other overseas
suppliers local suppliers yeah we do we
do work with some local suppliers he
does design work aside from merch so can
we show a teaser of the bins um we'd
love to show it to you of the pins yeah
let's show these are the pins do can you
bring my five yeah the face ones okay
okay make sure that your passport thing
there is not on your screen when I come
around that would be really super bad
but we have a really really cool unique
item that we're gonna be doing at LTX
this year we are printing a very limited
quantity of these because we figure most
people probably wouldn't want it that's
and it's gonna be super expensive
because they're not cheap to produce but
okay are we good clear yeah here this
so there's gonna be a pack and it's
gonna come in like a special box and
it's gonna have the faces of every
member of the LTTE team at least at the
time that we created them we're gonna
have new people by then but there's
nothing we can really do about that and
you're gonna get the whole the whole
pack of them they're gonna be about this
big all right they're gonna be about
this big and I mean they won't they'll
be kind of heavy like they're metal
they're not gonna be super wearable I
don't think but they'll be decorate
things with a bowl so it's gonna be
pretty sweet oh yeah actually
so Lloyd also arranged our lanyards for
LTX I'm just I hate crappy lanyards
because I'm one of those freaks that
actually wow that's a big bulge that's
because I'm actually one of those freaks
that actually wears a lanyard so I was
like look I want the LTX ones to be
really really nice so they're all metal
on the ends not gonna break and then the
clasp itself is actually metal too so it
should be a little more robust than your
typical tradeshow lanyard which I'm
which I'm excited about
okay Nick three things that you do here
at Linus Media Group I make sure that
Lloyd designs merchandise
I'll make sure that Johnno sells things
I make sure that Linus doesn't forget to
do things ok so everyone's making me do
a summary for them okay so Nick is kind
of like the doer of things you know if
there's something that you need it's
like it's weird if there's something
that I don't have time for but that I
can't pawn off to a subordinate like I
need a management level decision and I
need management level oversight on it
then it's Nick so like making sure that
not just like he doesn't help blade
design things in that he fires up
whatever software Lloyd uses to design
things and and and does it himself it's
not like that he's just working with
Lloyd on the roll out of our store to
make sure that the business side of it
is going smoothly and the same goes for
working with the sales team so Colton
and Jon Oh Nick also covers my butt on
all kinds of stuff so if
like a security call in the middle of
the night it actually goes to his phone
rather than mine so I get to sleep and
look beautiful for all of you people
that is the thing you do he also he also
pimps the merch like nobody else oh wait
I wasn't supposed to show that you gave
me you gave me hell wanting to show them
that okay
that's coming so like he'll post videos
if I'm not around to do it
Evon pure nepotism higher right what
three things you do here I do HR I do
well so HR is hiring too and dealing
with problems around the office between
people I do counting no we would never
have any of those would we you cause
most of them I'm just kidding anyway um
I do accounting and I do all the random
projects so if somebody's like hey I
want to do a roast can you plan the
event or hey design a set or hey build
the office like or hey actually we're in
an office that I decorated for Linus so
that you then took over then I'm well
okay I didn't assign myself as office
you gave it to me so the reason Yvonne's
in this office is because it's the
biggest one and Yvonne is actually two
people so Janice who's not here today
she usually works off-site sometimes
comes in and needs a desk as well so
there's two people in it that's why
Yvonne got it I'm like so salty though I
missed this office so much my new one
sucks it only has one Ethernet port and
it does have bigger windows which is
nice but my TV my TV is gone yeah we can
do that wait wait when when Matthew
comes in can I get another run to my
office yeah so to be clear James and
Yvonne both took credit for coordinating
the roast but it's different aspects of
it so Yvonne is overseeing sort of the
the team which includes Stephanie
watching
it's James which includes Lloyd so she's
kind of overseeing I'm Brandon Brandon's
hugely involved in like the live
production aspect of it and then James
he's coordinating the talent the actual
stage so without James there's no show
but without Yvonne there's nowhere for
there to be a show so that's kind of the
structure there cold cold we love we
love to mean that like what does Colton
even do here no no but I'm asking
everyone why do we need so many people
on staff right so what's three reasons
why you should definitely be on staff
we're gonna just find my job how are you
who would wear that shirt that was
stolen from work
high-end steal a dude okay first off
guys I'm really I'm really important
okay let me tell you let me tell you why
I should be here there's gotta be one
reason just today I don't know I helped
coordinate and manage a lot of the
business relationships I helped
coordinate different business ventures
like right now we're actually working
with one of our partners to create a
commercial like a full-blown like actual
commercial which Linus is starring in in
a couple weeks so that's gonna be really
cool and you know some other stuff and
then I'm like really stressed out about
that it should be to be good yeah all
right they're not watching whoops now
we've got a plan we'll be okay um yeah I
don't know and then where else do I do
here well you do some on camera yeah a
little bit on camera project
coordination the other project
coordination I mean the business part is
like the biggest part right so me John
oh and Nick kind of do a lot of stuff oh
there's Nick now the key LTX pimp yeah
actually right now we're hiring a event
coordinator for events are we doing that
already
yeah lysimeter group calm oh wow okay
there we go I don't know we had
announced that because I posted excited
that yesterday yeah it's already up back
quick people we're asking or not know
the hats are not fitted I'm sorry that
was gonna be just brutal I'll just be
too much inventory to myself an
inventory we had to make we had to make
decisions like we're not okay so we have
some purchasing power like the water
bottles that we have upcoming we bought
what like 5,000 of them
only two mm yes those are gonna go quick
I think we should do another few
thousand of them well with the amount of
time it's taken them to produce the
first few thousand we should maybe find
someone else okay all right well anyway
so so like we can buy a few thousand
something out of time but the thing is
when you've got something like a hat
where there's variations all of a sudden
you you know you only you might only
have a couple hundred of each variation
and then you've you know run out of a
certain thing and so you're 2,000 units
or whatever it's easy to run out of one
thing versus another so we had to make
decisions like do we want multiple
colors or do we want multiple sizes like
if we're if we're gonna go down that
path of having a bunch of SKUs so we
went with multiple colors instead of
multiple sizes to keep our SKU count
under control so there will be something
kind of like this I'm not gonna let you
look too closely at it because that's
actually an early sample and then
there's gonna be a black on black one as
well that looks great I've got a bunch
of people claiming that this is
prerecorded no I just really really suck
at reading super shots so Marco says LTT
LMG cases and hardware solutions when
honestly it's not really our focus you
know we think there's a lot of guys out
there doing a great job of computer
hardware and we're kind of leaving it to
them Joey says finally caught a stream
and watching since the ncx days thanks
so much
no thank you Joey all right so we've
made it downstairs the camera den is
empty I'll probably find Brandon and
David out there somewhere though okay ah
here we go
let's find the macro King whoa
so today's stream is why does a simple
youtube channel need so many people
working at it so I'm asking everyone to
kind of say three things that they do
that make them important here mom I mean
who else would eat this trail mix
without time but this is how I live
gives the seven thousand 2050 calories
in a single bag I forgot my lunch which
ended today
have this I don't know I edit videos iqc
most of the videos and I complain a lot
those are the three things that I do
well turns complaints are mostly about
like how we can improve processes and
our workflow and stuff so it's not
entirely horrible good job here um all
right why don't we move on to add one of
our one of our og members so the stream
today is why do we need so many people
to run a YouTube channel you don't even
it anymore it which is hello well you
say that but I just play okay when was
the last time you had edited a video
though what today yesterday before that
oh okay so what do you do
not much you kind of got me I'll pack up
my things together okay it's gonna be
another one that's gonna make me do it
yeah okay so what I do is I tell what
why I tell - what to do I tell what I
tell other people what to do as a result
of line is following me what to do does
that make sense
so Ed's kind of our he's our editor
supervisor slash kind of production
manager he also has kind of taken on
like a total like schedule planning type
role I don't know it sort of it's sort
of loosely defined i also hire people
yeah Oh actually he was involved in the
hiring process for two new editors is
that right
editors so basically spending all the
money okay cool so yeah I'd used to edit
like our heaviest projects things like
scrapyard wars but I think the plan is
to have someone else I don't scratch our
boards this time around isn't it
uh yeah Dennis no I just I just wasn't
experiment to tech LinkedIn PAC wiki ice
didn't think that you would reassume you
to scrapyard worse that's all
so for real though what oh one of these
two people right there okay probably
Alex P or better known as a prime or
Pella so yeah Ed's and sort of like he
also coordinates the shooters to so
anytime anyone in this room or the room
on the other side of this wall needs to
know what to do and is supposed to be
the go-between for writing and
pre-production and production so since
since we're on the subject of Dennis
Dennis oh look at that three things you
do aside from just one watching videos
at work yeah I'm watching you I know you
are approaching okay so what do you want
what do you want we don't have three
things you do here that make you a
critical member of the team oh I'm
taking personal calls at work hi this is
Dennis's personal assistant okay do you
things I do this shouldn't be that hard
I can think of like five games I'll be
serious okay
I do tackling look I'm everything right
now I'm actually working we'll just do
in two awesome half and I do two quickie
I do OTT
and sometimes I hope not sometimes it's
never happening the Charles will find
somebody tad but after trying we would
be saying I'm trying
well I still get a go for it yes oh so
I'm gonna roast you next Friday and this
is my outfit oh wow that is that is some
badass and print there that is some
leopard Pringles beautiful look at that
you Dennis also okay Dennis also
coordinates our Chinese translation
efforts
and he actually helps us source things
from China that we just don't have the
language skills to source like you know
like tile power or whatever I do what
other things that people people don't
know yeah and yeah yeah like contracting
me to paint his wall for yes I pay you
know you didn't pay me Pepe
yeah you gave me a pad thai that's less
than minimum wage everywhere and she I
you taste them I did eat most of it
though Pella doesn't come on camera much
so it's not really his thing but I'm
gonna ask him anyway Pella what's your
what's your three things that you do
here okay yeah Pella mostly edits videos
but he also has kind of like an eye for
detail so he has done some just sort of
random workflow improvement type things
over the years here that are a little
bit deeper than just I edit videos and
edit videos Pella has created templates
for a bunch of our sponsor placements I
think I've been watching the updates in
the editing chat on those fellows are
actually working on are you still
working on a new intro yes do you want
it do you want it do you want to see a
draft do you want to show them a draft
you can see what people think yeah this
is gonna be wow this is gonna be your
first real feedback on this you're gonna
have to put away your troll your troll
streams here I'm just gonna move away
from the chat real briefly here wow yeah
new intro finally is what the chats got
to say about that we know over over dude
the thing is like when you're replacing
the longer you leave it the more like
iconic it becomes and the harder it is
to replace it without causing endless
screaming so we're trying we still want
to do it in-house just because we really
like to okay here it is so I'm just hold
on let me frame this a little better
that down here we go all right hit it
it's just me oh there it is hmm so
there's no box so I haven't actually
seen so appears that my guidelines may
not have been followed that's the box
okay well we'll go through this later
we'll see we'll see if that ever sees
the light of day okay there is a box I
will give you that I'll have to here
with music I'll have to hear it with
music what do you guys think we've got
oh we've got that looks great
we've got old one is better we've got
boring we've got pretty cool we've got I
like it slow the logo down a little
we've got a bunch of people timed out by
nightbot old one better fire him old one
better nice I like it
simple gets the message across pretty
cool it's I eat that intro does look
cool so seems some you know what I'd say
50 50s about all you really asked for
with a large change like that then we've
got Alex P better known as a prime or me
Lord
yeah kind of three things you do here I
had videos I make snarky comments every
time and blow up his face I guess so
it's two of those were meme Lloyd things
yeah that's because that's what I do so
Alex actually has many different talents
he actually was the writer for one of
our drone reviews a while back I've been
I had actually intended to utilize his
skills there more but then drones as a
category just like kind of died and we
can't fly anywhere here anymore so that
was sort of a buffer yeah yeah Alex
actually has done a little bit of
shooting as well but mostly mostly yeah
mostly mostly editing and meme Laurie so
if you see a particularly dank meme on
the Twitter a lot of the time he was
involved
or Jake right Oh David okay three
reasons why do we need like two camera
operators if all we do is make youtube
videos because we make a lot of videos
and then we can kind of alternate all
set up one well Brendan shooting one and
then he'll set up one well I'm shooting
that the one that we just set up so will
you actually have some more traditional
production experience right yes yeah we
the question we're answering in this
stream is why do you need so many people
just to make youtube videos and from a
professional production standpoint how
would you say our staff to output ratio
looks our staff to help her she was
pretty excellent I'd say like most
production companies that are doing
videos like ours are having like triple
maybe quadruple this staff so would you
say you're overworked oh yes yes that's
some days yes yeah other days there's
like kind of not a lot to do I guess
that's kind of the nature of the beast
though you know we're in the tech space
where if there's no news sometimes well
actually when there's no news it's like
more work because then you have to just
like create news you have to be like oh
we took this weird thing that wasn't
intended to do this and we did something
different with it haha I'll take that
establishment um let's see if there's
anyone in the lounge not right now we
are so close to rolling out the finished
one so this is our AMD finished system
versus an Intel test bench stay tuned
do not miss the latest Lounge update
it's gonna be latest the newest which is
coming we shot it earlier this week
don't miss it don't miss it it's gonna
be awesome
Who am I missing John John Wright's Tech
linked on Mondays and fast as possible
for our tech quickie all the other days
so he's a full time writer he's off-site
though so I can't really show him to you
Jake
hey we found we caught up with Jake I
kind of explained what you do but the
purpose of this stream is three reasons
that you should be employed here like
we're justifying why we have so many
people on staff
I make sure when show works every week
we have it is late sometimes still but
normally it works I do most of the
networking video so if without me who
was gonna do that right Anthony okay
well damn it hmm
really struggling here and I he does
things he does things eating on you
that's like verbally okay that's fine I
already explained what you do anyway I
did it way better than you Batum and
then there's Brandon oh no it's perfect
that Brandon's gonna be kind of like oh
no never mind it's it's kind of
compensating for the kind of dramatic
lighting yeah but it's yes okay so
Brandon we're trying to we're trying to
justify in this livestream why we have
so many staff just to make youtube
videos so I asked David this already but
I'd love to hear your answer you also
have some more traditional production
experience yeah how would you say our
output to staff ratio looks to you
output to Stafford it's a it's excellent
I mean I like we-we-well we produce how
many videos a week and then we do other
projects that no one knows about until
they see them like there's so many
things that we do that people don't know
about cuz we're doing them not talking
about them do you know mean mm-hmm so
like like the roasts we only just yeah
yeah a few days ago and there's a couple
other large projects that no one's
talked about Colton actually tease the
this will be a pause way coming up and
I've been working on that for like over
a month and no one knows about it but
it's been a lot of work and it's all the
with the biggest project we've taken on
ever for a production standpoint and
like we still you don't notice that cuz
all the videos yep and like there's
little things that I think a lot of
people wouldn't necessarily appreciate
like Brandon and one of his production
industry friends actually coordinated
the redesign of the bedroom set we've
gotten a lot of really great feedback on
how good it looks especially with the
LED lighting that's built into all these
shelves you wanna turn on some
brightness who there
experience people an entire day to just
put in the shelves and then they had to
do the lighting so they're all floating
they're all like really strong like we
can actually put heavy things on them
but check this out
so the bookshelf now has lighting and
the shelves check that out also have
lighting so Brandon coordinated that
also the creation of these like gorgeous
resin tables scratch-built
resin tables like natural wood so it's
like little things that no one's gonna
be like oh you know wow that table looks
so great but it adds some it adds some
real production value to the videos that
otherwise just wouldn't be there well a
lot of great a lot of great feedback on
the resin tables thanks Brandon I think
I'm getting pretty close to you know
close to the end actually Oh Tyler so we
reached a point where my level of
disorganization just got too high and we
hired Tyler to take on my
disorganization what do you do here
Tyler I take on your disorganization
mm-hmm-hmm and cover for my boneheaded
mistakes yeah and now he actually also
has a helper
so Tyler is we're not using his name
we're not showing him on camera yet
because he's still on probation
but yeah so Tyler has a helper so Tyler
makes sure that when we have an event
like LTX all the pallets of stuff are
where they're supposed to be when
they're supposed to be there when we
have new items arriving he makes sure
that the right people know about them
when we're shipping things out other
than merch we have a third party
shipping logistics contractor for our
merch items but other than merch Tyler
ships out things like prizes for
giveaways stuff like that
Tyler coordinates like weird random
things like we need a trailer hitch on
the work truck who will do this this guy
that's how enthusiastic he usually looks
about it too but actually no I'm serious
Tyler seriously has a has a great
attitude which you definitely need to
deal with sort of between my nonsense
Brandon's nonsense and Yvonne's nonsense
you gotta have real you gotta you got to
be real positive you know I think that's
it I'm gonna so bad if I missed someone
I mentioned Janice but she's not here
today
I got Tyler I think I think we're good
yeah yeah I mentioned John hello John
John oh oh he wasn't at his desk I'll go
see I'll go see if John OHS back John
was a relatively new member of the team
but basically we work with you know
Colton or Nick would probably know this
but we work with literally dozens of
brands I mean we've got to support this
entire staff somehow we work with
literally dozens of brands so Colton was
just not able to keep up with all of it
by himself anymore so we added shadow
what do you do here John
I handle sponsorships outreach brands
and tell which kind of sponsor showcases
reach with you mm-hmm
pretty much yeah so he takes sort of my
no we're not gonna do that that's stupid
and he turns it into something that's
far less abrasive for like an agency or
brand to take back to the client and
then when the client says actually he
will then that comes back to John oh and
Jonah says - I would it would really be
great if maybe we could do this so he's
kind of like a translator between you
know one diva and then another diva it's
so there you go that's everyone who
works here for now at least everyone who
was in the office today and that's what
they do
now I need to actually help there you go
looks like David's all set up and we're
gonna shoot a video on this we're
thing so it's like it's like a memory to
s SD adapter thing pretty pretty weird
so I'm gonna do a video on that and then
when show which will hopefully be on
time but that seems kind of unlikely at
this point oh yeah I actually have most
of my script written for this to the
Nubia Alpha really weird SmartWatch with
a flexible display I've got people
asking about Ivan Ivan is no longer with
us so he's not here anymore
but thank you for remembering him Luke's
not here he's sick he's actually sick
today I would have shown the floatplane
peeps but they generally don't come in
on Fridays and Luke who would normally
be in at the end of the day on a Friday
is off site because he's not feeling
well all right thanks guys
buh buh bye oh hold on
hello this is great someone's like they
have scripts yes we definitely have
scripts hold on I'm gonna make sure I
don't show anything confidential on my
screen here Wow my password just one
second Oh
all right uh yeah I don't think there's
anything confidential here yeah so here
you go this is what one of our scripts
look like anyone who applied for one of
the writing positions will have seen
something like this already we sent out
some sample ones but there you go so
this is what I wrote up for this video
so we'll throw that on throw that on the
prompter and that's how it works bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
