this is the well aptly named Logitech
keyboard case for ipad 2 so what this is
is it is a keyboard and it is a case and
it is for the ipad 2 yes i know it's for
the ipad to just relax calm down don't
hit the dislike button just yet because
it's actually pretty cool if you happen
to be an ipad 2 user so check this up
back of the box pretty much explains
everything that this does so this is a
zagg co grounded khob rounded co-branded
product and manufactured by logitech so
my guess would be that zag had something
to do with the case itself and logitech
was primarily behind the keyboard it has
a bluetooth wireless keyboard which has
a recessed behind it that fits the ipad
2 and either portrait or landscape mode
it wraps around the ipad 2 to cover the
screen and the side that uses
high-density padding to help cushion and
protect the ipad 2 if you drop it and it
uses precision-cut aircraft-grade
aluminum which fits feels and looks
great so the reason you would want don't
back up and look at me the reason you
would want aircraft grade aluminum oh
yeah by the way this is the case i'm
using for my ipad 2 right now it's a
scorpion EXO 700 helmet bag okay so
obviously I needed an upgrade the reason
you would want that is that it's going
to match the ipad 2 and look really good
because if you have an ipad 2 odds are
excellent that you care about your case
matching it go figure right alright so
let's open this baby up and have a look
at the physical properties of it at the
very least in this unboxing and first
look it's a little bit on the heavy side
that would be that would be one
criticism that i would have of it right
off the bat although the ipad 2 is also
a little bit on the heavy side given its
size for a tablet let's look at the
finish of the aluminium first since
that's what people are very likely to
care about so you can see it is actually
quite different from the finish of the
aluminum on the back of the ipad 2 it
has more of a of a pinkish hue to it
whereas the ipad 2 is more of a pure
silver it's also quite a bit more
textured than the ipad 2 although an
advantage of having a more textured
finish on the aluminum itself is that it
will be more scratch resistant okay so
next we have
a USB cable so that USB cable I cannot
fathom what we would need it for just
yet so give me a second here maybe it is
yeah I guess that's if you wanted to use
this as a wired keyboard although I
can't imagine anything you would want to
plug this into and use it as a wired
keyboard given that it's so small
speaking of the size of the keyboard
it's actually not that bad to type on I
would prefer if the space bar were a
little bit more raised or if there were
a recess right here because you can't
quite pound on the space bar as much as
you'd want but it is easily reachable
you do have and this is a big advantage
here you do have long shift keys you do
have an enter that is let me see if I
could get very easily reachable the
backspace key or about Delete key sorry
I forgot we're using an Apple product
here so you know we don't we have the
command key welcome and I command you to
search actually I don't think you need
to press that so you've got dedicated
keys up here for search pictures
keyboard cut paste paste copy paste
you've got your media keys as well as
mute volume up and down and a latke you
have a connect button here and then you
can also turn it on or off and that's
what this is for that's to charge it yes
brilliant way to go Linus okay so as I
mentioned before the keyboard case can
be used either in let's just close that
either in portrait mode so you just put
it in there like that there's pretty
much no risk of your iPad 2 falling over
or in landscape mode if you wanted to
you know watch movies you know on air
video or whatever the case may be okay
so we'll go ahead and press the top
button over not bound yet okay so it
looks like what you have to do is you
have to connect it it's not on right now
give me a sec so once i turn my
bluetooth on and press the connect
button i can just click on the logitech
keyboard case by zeg oh and I failed
okay I can just click on the logitech
keyboard case by zeg and we better try
this again so to pair it all you got to
do is turn your bluetooth on and make
sure you don't wait too long so you just
enter the pin 7 6 08
eight followed by enter on the keyboard
and we should be connected so let's see
if now when I open up an appt such as
safari and I do this yeah so there now
all of my media keys are working I don't
know what media had playing oh yeah
there we go okay so there you go the
keyboard is working so if I wanted to
for example open up a notepad I could
look new note sure testing this keyboard
it whoops it is responsive and I think I
could get the hang of typing on it
fairly quickly that's a good layout
actually reasonable tactic a tactile
feedback it's got all of the important
keys which is pretty critical for a
small keyboard like this and actually
that's very impressive so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the Logitech
keyboard case it ain't cheap but it's
pretty nice actually overall and let's
just show you guys how it looks when you
put the iPad in it so it has to be
oriented a certain way okay so there's
your iPad connector there there's your
charger for this guy there's your
headphone jack so you can still use the
headphone jack as well as the standby
button when it's in there and that's
pretty much it yeah yeah the gap there
thanks for checking out my unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
