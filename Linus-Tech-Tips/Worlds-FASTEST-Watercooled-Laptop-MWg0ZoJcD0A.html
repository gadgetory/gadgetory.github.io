overheated we've seen every solution
from adding extra fans to cracking open
the bottom panel too far sketchier
methods than those but what if one of
the world's most skilled and apparently
insane teams of engineers was presented
with this problem
well you might end up with a solution
that looks a little something like this
meet the asus GX 800 the world's most
powerful water-cooled laptop
we're opening up a new merch store you
can check out some of our new gear today
at the link in the video description the
first things you'll notice taking the
two pieces of the GX 800 out of the
included backpack and travel case are
one this laptop comes in two pieces more
on that later and - it looks flippin
badass the matte black palm rests metal
accents and strategically positioned
lighting effects give it every bit as
premium a feel and look as you'd expect
for its whopping six thousand dollar
price tag coming around the back is
where things get really interesting
though these quick connect fittings
allow the GX 800 to be easily docked and
undocked from the included external
water cooling unit so going from
portable to performance takes less than
10 seconds place the laptop down on
these two pins then push down here to
lock and load once engaged the docking
station thanks to its second power brick
doubles the available power to 660 watts
and engages the pump and radiator fans
turning this beast from a fox that might
steal your chickens to like one of these
things but what could be in this machine
to warrant all of this extra power and
cooling well to overclock GT X 1080
graphics cards in SLI get donc what do
you think there was going to be in their
mobile hardware and the rest of the
specs of this thing are absolutely
bangin - it's rocking 3 m dot 2 drives
in raid 0 for one terabyte of blazing
fast solid-state storage 64 gigs of DDR
4 RAM and a core i7 78 28 K that's
overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz out of the
box
io is
impressive with just about everything
you could want including thunderbolt
three DisplayPort and this funky Network
antenna extendo thing so you could have
like mad dope AF internet even when
you're not plugged in or whatever they
were trying to do with that and all of
that power won't be wasted on a monitor
that can't take advantage of it
the GX 800 has an 18 inch 4k 60 Hertz
g-sync IPS display which comes with all
the benefits you might expect super
sharp image quality in games and 4k
videos along with great viewing angles
and variable refresh rate technology
that makes lower frame rates appear
smoother to the eye while eliminating
screen tearing not that you'll be
running into low frame rates very often
the way this laptop stomped on
everything we threw at it at Ultra
details at 4k resolution is nothing
short of amazing with the terrain and
rise of the Tomb Raider looking proper
stunning I mean so did everything else
but what really sets it apart from the
other balls to the wall laptops that
we've checked out recently is that the
GX 800 is surprisingly good as a
traditional laptop when its undocked
while it is a little on the chubby side
it's not leg crushingly heavy like the
predator 21x and the large properly
positioned trackpad responds well with
nice satisfying clicks on the discreet
right and left buttons it might look a
little bit over the top if you roll up
to the library and whip out one of these
things but if you need on-the-go
productivity or gaming it is usable for
a little while the mechanical style
keyboard is reasonably comfortable to
type and game on but it doesn't use
Cherry key switches like the predator 21
X so the feel will be mushy ER and
consistent I did find myself making more
errors than usual with that said the
nearly standard layout and the full
number pad are nice touches but let's
move on then from the practical aspects
of this beast and focus on answering the
question you've all been waiting for how
the actual F does water cooling in a
laptop work well we're gonna have to pop
off the bottom to see and would you look
at that
the GX 800 not only has a full air
cooling setup with six heat pipes and
two fans it also has this absolutely
bonkers
fully custom water cooling loop but
there's some bad news in here unlike
some high end laptops the GX 800 s GTX
1080s are soldered to the motherboard
meaning that there's no swapping them
out in the event of a failure or for
something else down the road though it
should be noted that everything about
this laptop is top-of-the-line and it's
unusual for future graphics cards on
laptops anyway to be supported by the
existing cooling system but can water
cooling make enough of a difference in a
laptop to compensate for those drawbacks
to answer that we'll be comparing
performance docked and undocked against
a full on desktop with similar hardware
and hmm it seems in our testing the
extra juice both water juice and power
juice well it doesn't make as big of a
difference as you might expect with us
observing about a 10% increase in
performance on the maximum performance
profile in a Seuss's software this might
make the docks usefulness seem highly
questionable but I also have to point
out that it makes the Machine heaps
quieter without the dock it's like every
other uber laptop louder than a tuba
recital in the apartment above you but
when it's docked it
calms down I mean I wouldn't call it
silent but it's low roar isn't overly
distracting there is some more bad news
though our GPUs ended up in the mid 60's
under load on water cooling which is
great but for some reason the cooling
solution couldn't quite seem to keep up
with our CPU with thermal throttling
kicking in under heavy load and a
Seuss's extreme you know feed it power
till it burns profile I suspect that
this was a conscious effort that was
made to direct cooling to the GPUs
because during gaming it's unlikely that
the CPU will hit full load and so we
didn't actually experience this thermal
throttling in any of our gaming tests
but if you wanted to use this thing as a
video editing powerhouse you might want
to make some adjustments we were able to
mitigate the problem to a degree by
creating our own less aggressive
overclock profile at 4.2 gigahertz which
as disappointing as that might be it
should still be noted is the fastest
we've ever seen one of these mobile
processors by a hundred megahertz making
then the GX 800 by every measure the
fastest widest gaming laptop we've ever
tested while docked with the flexibility
to carry most of its 4k gaming
experience with you in a sort of normal
sized backpack so it comes down then to
price and bulk would you spend $6,000
for the privilege of owning one of these
