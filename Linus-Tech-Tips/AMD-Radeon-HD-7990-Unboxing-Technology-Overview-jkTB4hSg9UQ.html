comm slash Vengeance gaming to learn
more all right so we're a little late on
a 7990 unboxing but quite frankly AMD
was a little late on releasing the
product as well because the GTX 690 has
been around for quite a while and this
right here is AMD's direct competitor to
the GTX 690 so a GTX 690 is basically 2
GTX 680 s and a Radeon 7990 is basically
2 Radeon 7970 s so just like the last
generation product the 6990 which was
released a long time ago this features
two full tkt course that's 2048 stream
processors as well as a dual 384 bit
memory bus with 6 gigabytes of gddr5 and
that's clocked at 6 gigahertz so
remember guys with dual GPU solutions
you only get half of the RAM as your
usable Ram just like you would with any
SLI or crossfire X setup now there was a
time when I really couldn't recommend
dual GPU solutions so our dual GPU cards
and that was maybe you know when the
7950 GX 2 rolled out yeah it was super
powerful but sli scaling issues at the
time aside the biggest problem with it
was man did that thing run hot and man
was it loud they have completely
overhauled the way this work so in spite
of the fact that this is a dual slot
card see no triple slot solution it is
still capable of running at a nine
hundred and fifty megahertz base clock
with a one gigahertz boost clock which
is faster by a significant margin than a
regular 7970 and almost the same speed
as the 1000 50 megahertz boost clock
that we see out of a 79 70 gigahertz
Edition so full fledged GPUs only a
slight reduction in clock speed and a
dual slot solution and the cards
actually quiet in terms of acoustics it
is very similar to the GTX 690 so this
is enabled by a very very custom cooling
solution that is capable of dissipating
the 375 watt TDP that this card has now
that 375 watt TDP
is about 75 watts more than on the GTX
690 but by I mean check this out by
implementing this cooler that has four
heat pipes attached to massive aluminum
fins so I'll show you the heat pipes
here as well so these are coming out of
both sides as well as a huge chunk of
copper in the middle here on the vrm
solution and more heat pipes more copper
fins all the way over here more heat
pipes hopefully you can see those
through the through the ventilation
holes there more heat pipes more copper
fins almost the entire front of the card
is covered in aluminum fans copper heat
pipes and that chunk of copper right
there for vrm so what AMD has done is
they implemented this solution with
three fans and a massive what I'd
normally consider to be high-end
aftermarket air cooler to keep the card
as quiet and as cool as a GTX 690 in
spite of the higher TDP one of the other
things that really helps this card is it
does have to heat eCourse so it features
their zero core technology which means
that when you're idling only one of the
GPUs is even powered on the other one
basically goes off and there's actually
an indicator light here on the back that
tells you hey I'm turned off don't worry
about me right now
so yeah in addition to zero core
technology I'd like to take you guys on
a bit of a tour of the card itself so on
the back we find a full back plate as
we've come to expect from AMD's very
high-end cards with two cutouts for the
GPU cores themselves so you can see
exactly where those two tahiti cores are
located you can also see the PCI Express
3.0 16x interface at the bottom as well
as a crossfire connector up here at the
top only a single crossfire connector on
this card because dual GPU cards so
often you see guys on the forum oh I'm
running for DT x6 and I know you aren't
because dual GPU cards count as two
cards in sli or crossfire already so you
can only link them two by two or two
times two for a total of four GPUs
that's the maximum supported by both AMD
and NVIDIA at this time on the top of
the card we've got two eight pin
connectors so yes it consumes a lot of
power about ten percent more than a
single 7970 at idle and the somewhere
between a GTX
and dual 79 70s under load this is in
large part due to the very selective
bidding process that AMD goes through in
order to get to GPUs that can go on a
single card and be running at like a
gigahertz when they're boosted up and
not go over that 375 watt power limit on
the rest of the top of the card you've
got a bios switch up here as well as
just very very sleek looking but well
ventilated cooler shrouds so one thing
to note about these open-air design
coolers is that while they do keep the
card itself very cool they exhaust the
heat into your case so down here along
the bottom of the card you can see it's
more open ventilation so unlike a GTX
690 or even a Radeon 69 actually 6990
went both ways
so unlike a 4870 x2 it's going to
exhaust heat into your case as opposed
to just out the ventilation holes at the
back you will get a little bit coming
out the back but it's yeah it's going to
be it's going to be quite limited so
you're going to want to make sure you
have a case with great ventilation on
the back we can also see the i/o so
we've got a DVI port as well as four
mini DisplayPort ports so you can easily
run a maxed out Eyefinity setup off of
this single card so the real question
here is for $1000 graphics card yeah I'm
going to mention price I usually don't
because sometimes they change not
expecting this one to change anytime
soon what is the compelling value add
because you can either get to Tahiti
cores or basically a trip to Tahiti and
it's up to you which one of those is
better so there's three cards at that
price point there's the 7990 there's a
gtx 690 and there's the gtx titan these
are very different solutions so 690
being a bit of an older card has two by
two gig memory frame buffers so the
problem with that is it's just not
really enough memory to run at something
like a 4k resolution and expect to be
able to put in sort of high res texture
packs or anything like that on your
games gtx titan has six gigs of GPU
memory but it's a single single GPU
solution so while it gives more
consistent performance it doesn't
necessarily have the raw horsepower
that's something like 7990 does or
something like gtx 690 does okay which
puts 7990
somewhere in the middle where it has
three gigs of memory that's usable okay
so six gigs total it has slightly more
the well has significantly more power
than a gtx titan coming in very close to
something like a gtx 690 and but there's
more okay so okay so it has higher power
consumption than 690 significantly
higher power consumption than Titan it's
about the same volume as 690 whereas
Titan is quieter and it consumes more
power and outputs more heat than either
of those two cards but AMD says never
settle and never settle indeed this card
comes with eight games or at least it
did at launch and AMD will continue by
all appearances to support never settle
so if you get a card that's a thousand
dollars but it comes with a few hundred
dollars worth of games is that a
compelling value ad to you are you
willing to sacrifice a little bit on
your power bill over the next little
while or have a slightly hotter room
where you have to run your air
conditioning higher or whatever else
it's totally up to you and that is all
aside from the FCAT issue remember guys
frame capture has become the new de
facto standard for how to benchmark
graphics cards that's where you're
looking at the actual output frames as
opposed to the frames that are requested
to be drawn by the card which is what a
program like fraps does and AMD has a
new driver coming that will resolve the
issue with stuttering with their dual
GPU solutions but we haven't seen it yet
so it's hard to say exactly how that's
going to perform so I know that was a
lot of information in a very short
period of time but if you're shopping
for $1,000 graphics card basically what
you need to know is and ease higher
performance drivers coming it does
consume more power and output more heat
but it comes with a wack ton of games in
the box which might make that a
compelling solution for you thank you
