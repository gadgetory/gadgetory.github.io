your broadcast why is it giving me these
messages now it's never shown me these
before just go for it oh it's recording
anyway so yeah we're love ya twitch is
giving me somehow or rather xsplit is
giving me some error that you have the
stage right here I'll show you guys the
error because this is a stupid stupid
stupid error check this out you have a
stage resolution set to over 1920 x oh
that's weird look at that I'm dragging
Melinda around but you guys can't see it
it looks like xsplit hides itself from
itself so that it won't interfere with
itself and of course I've screwed up the
hotkeys for tonight so I cannot use my
keyboard to switch from one view to
another hi I'm Linus I'm slick c- tech
on twitter slick pc on twitter if you
guys are following on twitter you'll
already know that we had some technical
difficulties tonight so i'm going to
sort of share those with you really
quick because all men it involves some
not cool stuff so number one is if that
is my dinner which I've been eating and
number two is that that they're SSD
right there has windows 8 on it which
wouldn't normally have been a problem
for us except that we didn't have any of
our software sub properly and we were
not able to get that their black magic
intensity pro capture card working with
it so then we had some issues with the
quadro card here outputting to display
port which we thought would work fine
with a perfectly DisplayPort see that
display port in enabled monitor but it
ended up not working so then what
happened next we couldn't find any
drivers for the motherboard we couldn't
find him drivers for the motherboards
land for that once and I had to bust up
my laptop but then we switch back to the
shuttle anyways and just try to fix it
and then we couldn't get that to work
and then I touched the keyboard and it
just well yeah I mean this is kind of
like last time I got the black magic
card working where I was in the middle
of I spent uh I think over a course of
two days a grand
about seven hours on it and what finally
happened like I tried changing every
setting and then what finally happened
was I changed one setting and then the
system blue screened and then it
rebooted and everything worked perfectly
and I was like this is bad because it's
the very worst kind of trouble shooting
when you actually don't know what you
did to fix it yeah because then when you
have the issue again you end up 35
minutes late for a live stream sorry
it's all his fault you know no okay hold
on okay who removed the ad to drive you
told me to remove it I didn't do it I
didn't know there was a little move date
I'm did you removed it from the p280 so
whose fault is it that we didn't have
her streaming computer I didn't realize
that we would never back up I'm the only
drive that we are set up for you another
one that's done every single screen well
you you were there for what you know
what I don't think I don't think I'm
gonna be able to successfully blame this
on you I can try no all right I'm just
signing in to twitch TV so we can so we
can have a look at the chat and see if
we have any audio issues that were of
course not aware of it all because we
haven't even looked at it yet um here
hold on hold on channel channel going to
the channel of course I have to click
this to show you guys oh oh oh that's
gonna be a problem there we go got that
fixed no audio issues hey guys speaking
of audio issues is the audio level okay
tonight um Oh funny story actually
awesome story did I tell you about this
okay so um I was telling diesel people
are complaining about the audio levels
on this camera it's driving them crazy
and and and he's like oh that's funny
it's an eight thousand dollar camera and
a three hundred or two hundred or
whatever dollar microphone there should
be no audio level issues right no and
I'm like no no they're complaining about
it and I tried it I cranked the dials
all the way up to ten and it didn't do
anything it didn't help at all and he's
like oh yeah that's that's really weird
and then he's like oh you know you have
the audio input level set to auto right
haha I was like what do you mean set to
auto he's like oh yeah yeah if you want
to use the manual nice yeah you have to
turn it off head off our own modem plate
what what do you mean have to turn it
off all right yeah so it took him a
matter of like 15 seconds to embarrass
me and and not not and yeah not be
stumped at all by the thing that had
been driving me in the audience crazy
for ages so ha what all did we film
today uh storage spaces okay so windows
8 storage spaces we film that today
we're Sanders with green drives oh yeah
WD has a new green drive you guys maybe
we'll talk a little bit about bad on the
live stream yeah pretty cool do that
it's cool yeah it's a little faster yeah
way faster way faster green dr good
stuff and 3d balancing is always good
yeah what else did what else did we
filmed I think what five episodes from
you did you finished off the tablet oh
yeah we did a closer look at the asus
vivo de wow the table was almost just
knocked over excellent yeah the HP
elitebook yeah we checked out an HP
elitebook so I did an unboxing of that
elitebook already but we did kind of
just like a closer look at it and you
know some glamour shots of it with a
better camera um I think there is one
more extreme edition 3960 vs 13 Saudi
yes new extreme edition so we did we did
five NCIX tech tips episodes today and
then we rushed home driving safely at
exactly must-revalidate in my car
navigating carefully between all the
other cars got here as quickly as we
could and then I was like slick you
idiot you took the bag look at let you
play me for that there's no way fault oh
so anyway we're alive we're good
everything's cool and here you go if
you're not following us on twitter make
sure you're following us on twitter oh
my goodness you
what I just realized remember how I said
we had to put together the judging for
the momentum for the for the keyboard
nerd rage contest you know what we can
go to immediately up to please yeah you
know what guys we are going we did a boo
boo because we were supposed to sit
together for a few hours today and do
all the judging from the contest and we
got tied up filming content and then we
got tied up doing this so tell you what
guys right after this live stream which
ends on unfortunately which ends in
about we go to what nine til 1030 so
we'll maybe go to like 1045 say so ends
in about an hour we will judge them and
we will upload a video immediately to
the linus tech tips youtube channel
announcing the five winners of corsair
k90 keyboards so I'm very sorry for that
guys but yes that will be coming let's
do a little bit of Twitter interaction
before we before we go much further here
huh yeah we need cat tips okay I'll
bring in the cat rocket come here
where's the boom boom yeah where's
Rumble Rumble okay good boy come here
come on come on come here rumble come on
there you go okay we're bringing the
cats okay the cats have officially
joined the live stream there we go okay
so no more no more complaints about not
enough cats of course have you heard of
our program start eight it brings the
Start menu back to Windows 8 actually
there's a few things that bring the
Start menus back pain Samsung has a
proprietary thing slick heard about
something as well what was it called
someone posts on my Twitter I don't
remember the exact name of it but i
think is made by either rocket dr.
stardock and it's supposed to just be
amazing i haven't tried it yet but i'm
planning to you okay so we'll we'll give
that a try we'll see if we can figure it
out honestly the issue we had with
windows 8 tonight was related more to I
think the black magic card not have a
sort of Windows 8 maybe you're quite the
right thing going on d stuff yeah it
like barely kind of works with windows 7
it's not surprising as problem
I mean we we did some playing around
looking avermedia card the live gamer HD
was that wednesday it was wednesday i
was wednesday honestly holy crap like we
NCIX tech tips episode but i swear we
shot most of it in real time because it
was just like I just worked it just
worked right away yeah and like we went
from streaming from a pc to streaming
from an xbox it was literally just
unplug plug instantly working yeah that
was just incredible and and it has the
benefit of doing on the fly h.264
encoding for the content so you don't
end up with like huge huge huge huge
files which is really really cool slick
good question for you will you be
getting a new oil cooled PC no time in
the near future if if I do I have like a
grand plan for what I want to do with
the oil cooled PC while I had it I had a
lot of people saying oh where you put
fish in it because fish consumed have an
oil but um what I really want to do is
mount a small may find out the viewers
it wasn't the viewers saying that though
it was like friends of mine which is
embarrassing but um you can mount a
smaller fish tank within a much larger
fish tank and mount it up on like say a
plexiglass walk or something and have a
water fish tank with the mineral of fish
tank within it um so for those of you
who haven't seen slicks old oil cooled
PC I'm running it in the window next to
him here very very cool you want to just
do a quick run-through explaining sort
of what these guys are looking at right
here stock cooler stock Intel cool are
you serious yeah no it's fine it's
absolutely fine I had I had a custom
cooler there it made absolutely no
difference actually um i'll let that
ugly guy hey drew brees go back to the
cool computer i can't actually point
Alex my hand goes off the screen I'll
point the mouse here see thank you guys
so the white label yeah here that's a
pump yeah okay just pushes oil back in
dominator memory dominate your memory
like a boss what board is this uh the
750 I for the win ah yes 750 I so LGA
775 don't worry we've upgraded slicks
machine since then what about some of it
okay talk about the challenges of
running
oil cooled computer um okay I ran it for
like four years some people message me
and they're like oh I built norco pc
then I took it down two months later and
I had no problems it's really easy when
you start moving it around all the time
like I moved to Victoria and back with
this like I carried it in my arms on the
ferry was it how much this thing weigh
Oh what I don't I never actually like
Wade it but it weighed a ton and like I
had to carry it with the radiator
attached and everything on the ferry why
should show I should show them I should
try and find the radiator here yeah see
there there look guys so the radiators
here that's a quad 120mm radiator and so
it's just not like perfect i'll text ya
fixed anyways just hanging with the
tuesday so i had to one arm the entire
computer and all the oil and then like
hold the radio there so it didn't torque
the hell out of my tubing and then like
some random stuff like oil hardens like
cables and plastics and it will climb
when it heats up I'm looking down they
took climate heats up so I had the i/o
for my computer coming at the top of the
tank as you can see in the video they
can't see anything okay fine there an
eye on the video there's the IO and my
hard drive but so the oil would climb up
I would move the top of the computer and
go along the cables and like a little
bit of it would get on my table all the
cables would harden like Mutt my cables
for my ducky which is so unfortunate the
nice detachable cable for my ducky is
completely solid and in this like
slightly snake formation awesome so what
would happen if you actually tried to it
would break it would straight-up break
right okay uh the plastic cracking on
the other side would break the wires on
the inside are fine but like exposing
them as a terrible idea right okay right
so what you're saying is you'd never do
it again I would actually but what
there's that there's the big plan much
work yes but this would be once I have a
house so I'm not moving it okay yeah bc
and this would be a way bigger budget so
i can add different things in like
shielding so the oil can no stupid
project because it is no better than
doing something like three triple
radiators in a red box and then water
cooling every pasta
component but it's fun and different and
interesting and I always have its own
trap but fish on it yeah but if you used
or if you use the red box then you could
run it outside then you have like the
best temperature as possible because it
never gets cold enough here in Vancouver
that it would actually freeze if you're
actually running it over time truth so
you could have like we can be here to
I'm not saying that I'll go to oil
computer I'll get way too viscous that
gets that cold so I won't put it outside
i meant i could do that as well but then
your temperatures would suck compared to
water but it's i can put it on like i
can they can't see that no one even
cares cuz your idea is bad no it's cool
so like something like this i guess if
it was shorter you could put a fish tank
in that little alcove and then put the
computer within it then you can hook
that up to you don't want a big fat hdmi
cable all the way across like what your
ceiling then you'll have like big ugly
fixtures on your ceiling like that see
that's what happens when you run cables
all over your living room you don't to
run it all over your living on it's not
during a crazy setup like that I'm
pretty sure you could afford one red
mere cable and you can afford to go into
the wall i'm pretty sure that be okay
fine let's talk about your dead graphics
card now as i pulled everything out of
my system by 26 yeah oh yeah oh died
really do you think that was related to
running it on the oil for 25 years I was
it was longer than that but yeah
probably that's probably true OG 260 is
still a decent card that's a real shame
yeah if nothing else it could be a
dedicated physx card Borderlands 2 oh
it's what's buzz too is ridiculous you
can run it on like anything every
dickless I setting most don't get crazy
frame rate but you'd get a dedicated
physx okay batman arkham city who cares
okay well it seems you on that as me so
I don't even well I think that a live
video card is better than a dead one I
agree and I wish I had my 260 I do it's
fun you got to do some fun stuff going
for a performance all the time is
awesome and I'm doing that
computer right and I want to always have
one of those but it's fun to also have
like little fun project computers as
well okay all right well I think that
you and I can agree to disagree about
your bad idea that we can both agree is
terrible it's not the great it's not
gonna cover you up with questions now
okay let's move it okay I think here
I'll get real conclusion real conclusion
I would never do okay I told myself I
was because i have three pa1 20.3
upstairs I have a baller pump that i
paid like two hundred and fifty dollars
for and i was going to build myself like
an outdoor shoot me yeah I showed you
what I was gonna do so I was gonna build
myself 120 by nine red box thing with
the pump housing in it and I'll defend
like push Paul and it was gonna be
awesome and then I was going to run one
set of tubing into like two computers
that are next to each other and cool the
whole thing because I'd have tons of
heat capacity for it and what I realized
is that once you move into a house your
time gets consumed with like cleaning
the kitchen we also have a pretty well
yeah but I didn't have a baby for the
first year and a half but I was here but
it's just like there's so many stupid
things like furniture shopping is the
worst thing ever like guys am i right
like furniture shopping is the stupidest
thing ever it's like horrible I just
don't do it and when you take well yeah
but you'll need furniture and like a
girl will make you shop and based on the
feedback of our viewers last week a
slick should have no trouble attracting
plenty of the ladies at least if the
ladies are our viewers so check this out
and we're going to do highlights of
comments from last week's from last
week's live stream always thought that
slick was a little i'm gonna care you
know what i'm gonna move this so you
guys can all admire sleep while we do
this it was sort of problem always
thought that slick was a like a little
weak teenager that followed minus around
okay something something
something something where's the hair
hold on hold on where is it okay hot oh
man why am I not a hot nerd like slick
hi new guy you're hot slick so freaking
hot forty two thumbs up hotel no slick
is hot I can't decide who's hotter lines
with ya see one person gives me proud
thank you for that viewer it's like his
hot licks a hottie okay okay now let's
try keyword slick ah ok ok ok ok it's
like my little slick made me gay did it
did it did it down but didn't that
because ok it's like his hot mix hot
slicks big slicks big and manly and hot
so uh so I think that I think that
sooner than later you should be running
into a situation where where you're
gonna have to go shopping with a girl
right mind you you almost met a girl at
school do you want to tell thats all
right ok ok ok I dated the same girl for
about four and a half years I got that
relationship ended with another girl for
about four months I was introduced to
for a friend so to give you time frame
didn't like actively go and try and find
women for about five years right so you
say go into man doing that fine my left
arm as you guys probably saw on the last
live stream was slimmed up it still
hurts like hell but it's fine and I was
walking down the hallway and I was king
something in my right hand again so I
gotta go through one of the doors and
she opens the door for me and I walked
through say thank you and then she walks
like right beside me down a completely
empty corridor hallway ah yeah so I'm
like I should probably say something but
I just keep walking so I'm like whatever
and then as i go to walk away I'm like
okay bye and just walk down the hallway
go by to nanaimo bars i'm doing a
project for school and to take pictures
in the name of ours starts you know but
that's what passes for post-secondary
education it's pretty sad we're in this
like full programming course and we have
digital media that's like making what is
that me my partner decide to make web
pages bone and I will
are some danishes so we had excuses to
find them anyways so I'm coming back
down the hallway she's still there so
when I come back I'm like oh hey do you
want a Nanaimo bar and she's like oh
sherrie Bubba and we stand in for second
sheets in the mango bar I'm like okay
bye and just walk away and she was like
looking at me expecting Lee like I'm
supposed to say something and I
definitely should have said something
and you were gonna totally get like
sympathy attention oh it was like the
perfect storm of good situation arm in a
sling but to be clear she was like super
ugly and nerdy right no no ya see no so
slick may be as hot as you guys think he
is but he's out of the game for a while
came for a while yeah my theory is my
theory is that had nothing to do with it
he's just not really into that sort of
thing yeah which is fine which is good
you know um that's coo what do you think
of the h80i i think it's an h ad with an
eye on the end i think the new mounting
should be good i think that performance
should be pretty similar ah 22222 gotta
set 9 PDA mobile with lsi controller
what kind of storage array should i get
honestly heart out to that question
because it really depends what you need
are you looking for mass storage in
which case you want hard drives are you
looking for ball and SS fees which case
get SSDs sorry guys we are announcing
the winners of the nerd rage giveaway
later tonight we will we will do the
final judging later tonight we will get
that done for you start watch them
immediately after yeah yeah we'll start
watching them right away after okay I'm
almost afraid to click this link because
it can never be a good thing to click
random links that people on the Internet
send you
okay well we just got we just got we
just got trolled pretty good right there
sorry for that sorry for that guy is
that was that was not a good thing ok
Shane your band how did I been people I
don't know how to bad people Shane full
profile has three tweets yeah he's been
blocked BAM ok can you please note
solaris I'm sorry we will we will live
stream i'm watching will these water
cooling parts go get sorry Freddy no
time to look at that right now Wow ok
here good question why are you trying to
increase the professionalism of your
show some viewers like it as is personal
so um guess I'll field this one so there
is a need for both things I don't know
if you guys all know this but I maintain
two channels my personal one linus tech
tips as well as a second one NCIX con
for NCIX the store that i work at it's a
different viewer base and people have a
different expectation for the kind of
content they want the kind of
professionalism level so i am not going
to stop making casual videos in fact if
you've noticed for every experiment or
professional style video I upload I up i
also am continuing to upload every
single day one of my normal style
content videos so it's not like I'm
dialing back the production on the
videos that you guys like I'm just
increasing what I'm doing why am I
renovating my garage why did I invest in
new equipment that will become clear
later I can tell you right now that
slick and I are going to be at CES this
year we're going to be doing some really
cool coverage that's going to involve
the new equipment as well and there's
lots of cool projects coming up but um
can't see more for now so there you go
but don't worry don't worry the good
stuff you like is not going away you
should slit switch jobs for a day slick
as presenter and Linus as cameraman not
a bad idea Linus tech and slick pc who r
in wins in an arm wrestling match
seriously ok let's just do a quick let's
just do a quick bicep compare
sit here ya see that not here here here
here good that should be pretty much all
you need to know like I think I think
like his forearm is it probably about
the same size here here just put it put
it next to it yeah his forearm is bigger
than my bicep so that yeah is not not
something that is that is that great you
know what I found out actually not that
not that long ago it's looks kind of a
bully right he was telling me about this
roommate he had a gun at tie at the
University of Victoria that he used to
throw at the wall pick it up and throw
them at the wall can you explain why you
might do such a thing oh all players
right I I'm usually quite a nice guy
I've never had someone I would call
mortal enemy before but when you get
drunk and pick up my mineral L computer
and drop it and crack the whole
non-replaceable case and are the reason
why I dies later down the line I'm kind
of mad i got'em MADD what you're saying
is you've got a temper oh so you it can
be triggered so you threw him that the
wall did he do anything else to deserve
this um yes you did many things I'm not
entirely sure we could go through this
yeah um I used to have my desktop in my
buddy Harrison's dorm he threw rocks
through our window once hitting both of
our monitors okay beyond not okay um
listen there's what okay I really don't
think I should could do that that's
another really big reason but what mom
we just put it this way and involved a
tie on the door yes and someone entering
who should not have entered right so so
you're saying that that he deserved to
be thrown at the wall he definitely
definitely deserve to be total he also
attacked me first yeah I i don't think i
have my my email with all of my plans
topics here so I'm gonna have to open up
my gmail so I'm gonna get slick to bring
up one of his topics for the live stream
tonight and I'll be don't worry we've
got some good stuff i'm gonna min yes
dan the Man okay
don't be still watching again the man if
you're on the twitch chat I want you to
say something if you're there because
you are awesome you are dan the man and
you are the man because we honestly
slick and I have been super busy today
we haven't had as much time to pay
attention to our Twitter as we would
like everyone's saying they're down the
man now so uh oh yeah there's a couple
go back to the tweets from before the
last room started each meal ah I can't I
won't be able to find them but uh but
yet whoever okay dan the Man if you're
actually here you're awesome because Dan
was taking care of all the people asking
when the live stream was starting
although we didn't end up starting at
that time no sorry dad sorry dude we
made you look dumb unfortunately that he
was also taking care of all of the
people who were asking about how to join
the live stream so that was awesome he
replied to like a ton of tweets so thank
you Dan what else we got uh vimeo tip
sure Oh vimeo tip jar okay have you guys
heard of it have you heard of this snow
okay all right we brought I like I just
told him the topic but I didn't actually
give him the details so vimeo has
introduced what's called a tip jar for
content creators and so instead of being
an ad driven thing and instead of being
like oh herpy derpy derp like i know
there was one tech video guy on youtube
that used to turn off comments on all of
his videos and just say if you want to
comment on the video go to my website so
he was trying to drive traffic away from
YouTube which is very difficult to do um
you know if you want that go to my
website and doom and he gets like
advertising revenue there so that's that
was one way to get money and it's just
not very effective and people don't like
it whereas if you make it voluntary I
don't think people have a problem saying
you know hey this is someone that I
enjoy watching and you know here's a
dollar or here's two dollars I mean it's
a good platform especially for a tip
based stuff so like you don't have to do
something you look it up they answered
your question yeah go ders
yeah I mean it's something that for what
I'm doing online is tech tips it
probably doesn't make that much sense I
don't think people will tip me for
unboxing like you know my apple juice uh
but for something like we're or even
like comics or people who are producing
web series that could be just awesome
night like uh oh what's his name Freddie
Wong yeah someone that you want my views
are epic yeah yeah they deserve ladies
are credit I mean Freddie Wong i think
is doing okay for yourself yeah i'm sure
it is aside from that yeah let's do well
yeah i think it's a great idea i'm units
the problem is i don't see realistically
anyone but youtube actually ending up
existing at the end of all this umm
Ramiz been around for quite a while I
know they miss I mean okay okay bindi
has been around for they're not even
number two though number two is um
dailymotion no yeah yeah dailymotion i
think is about a quarter the size of
youtube or something like that and it's
i mean that for the North American
viewers you know hey feel free to tweet
at us or or actually here we'll we'll
have a quick look at the okay the twitch
chat has disappearin elated there it is
we'll have a quick look at the twitch
chat and um guys what what was I saying
you're saying that dailymotion was
limited yeah have you ever watched a
video on dailymotion I think it's more
of a European thing and I hear well
we'll go back to we'll go back to the
twitch chat and let you guys let you
guys see what you think no no wall
youporn come on guys ah no dailymotion
is not a cheap ad site it's actually all
of my videos get syndicated over to
dailymotion as well but they don't get a
lot of views over there just because no
one oh he says oh okay apparently
apparently dailymotion is popular
because it has soft core porn on it
apparently that guy random shot TV video
shows ever
oh ok well I guess now we know why
dailymotion is one corner cuz if you two
wanted to double their traffic tomorrow
we know what they could do we thought
were the double 800 k then why don't we
just move right along new topic we
convict we're gonna move away from that
topic um I want to make a comment about
the android tablet versus apple tablet
last dream oh come on you're not gonna
bring that up again we were okay we were
talking about performance and I got a
whole bunch of tweets about people
saying that they were now having a hard
time deciding because they love their
android phone and they love their
Android everything and they're going to
go buy new android tablet now they're
unsure because we said android tablets
not that great because they don't
perform very well but if you're a huge
Android famine fan and love everything
to do with Android don't just go buy an
apple tablet cuz it's fast okay all up
but a belt okay what you're about to say
sounds an awful lot like well if you
happen to be a huge Justin Bieber fan
you should probably download the
boyfriend single poor Vincent yeah it's
a terrible song do you know his songs no
I I listen to it because haha why do you
listen to it I thought you were there I
remember I didn't I play it during on we
searched for it on youtube we were
testing a tablet or something oh and it
was like the front page or something so
I was just like Justin Bieber boyfriend
and you know I think yeah you were there
yeah you were there you were like oh
that's a terrible song i'm like i
couldnt get out that it's justin bieber
should be okay canadian know that oh but
i know it was bad it was not good it was
like it was like bad it was like just
bad for the true Justin Bieber fans only
rude you know what my mom was telling me
is the surest way to find out if it's
justin bieber's birthday is to go into
any middle school and if all the girls
are wearing purple and it's justin
bieber's birthday because apparently
it's his favorite color and all the
tween girls were purple in it
why don't you finish your story I
remember us talking you were talking
about how oh oh yeah just like if you
love the Android experience if you're
into brooding if you're into changing
our realms if you're into like and stuff
maybe don't change let's buy an android
tablet okay I mean you can get faster
android tablets galaxy note 10.1 is
using a newer faster processor right um
it's a little heavy but then again so is
ipad 3 I think and for for that matter
the slightly more faster one ah are you
pulling another topic no I got another
one so the verge did a fantastic article
on AMD we're not going to spend long on
this one but i'm just going to show this
to you guys if you're not familiar with
the verge great site verge com actually
know what it's probably easier to just
do this Virge Andy what happened to AMD
this is a great look at what the heck
happened to AMD over the last little
while I don't know if you guys have seen
this but AMD stock is at pretty much an
all-time low i think there was one point
in 2008 when the recession really really
hit that they were a little bit lower
than this but they're down to a dollar
eighty six per share if you guys are
gonna be able to see this it's gonna
focus or not it goes through the line go
hero camera whatever you can see the
trend line on the bottom that's kind of
all you need to know so they're down to
a dollar eighty six per share when they
were riding high I mean it wasn't that
long ago that every gamer had an athlon
64 or an f1 64 x2 in the ring I had one
I am buying blah actually I took a good
to hear let's let's see who had the most
def 164 I sooo yeah too I had a 3,000
plus then I upgraded to a 3200 plots
then I got a 35 hundred plus claw hammer
Wow then I got a 4400 plus then I got an
OP Turon 165 which was just a 4400 plus
but it overclocked a little bit and I
think from there I went to a core two
duo so I had like five of them free and
that yeah that so I had 754 rig I had
and several nut how many boards did I
have I had an msi 754 board then I had a
nice ooh 754 board then I had on 939 I
had a nice one then I had an a bit one
all right oh oh oh I had an ass rock one
do you remember that epic board that had
AGP and pci express i had my x 800 xt
platinum edition AGP card in there and
then I was ready for my 7800 GT upgrade
when I was done with that my favorite
board for fo 64 is my dfi lanparty dfi
lanparty okay I you know what it's
probably the most legendary board that
I've never owned yeah yeah other than
maybe like I see seven max yeah that's
that's another like super legendary
board but uh anyway sorry so so anyway
great article you guys do check it out
because it's a really good look at sort
of what's happened over the last little
while what kind of new steps therap in I
mean they went seven months without any
clear leadership in the company which is
really hard to do and still know what's
going on they've gone through a thirty
percent reduction in staff under a month
ago so it's uh you know I think we all
hope for the sake of keeping Intel in
line I think we've seen what's happened
over the last three years or so where
we're getting like these small
iterations on the cpu side I mean
where's my eight-core processor it's
there they just haven't unlocked it
because they don't have to so i see i
think we're all rooting for them but
it's tough right now so yeah moving
right along let's go back to wait you
had a topic right I've got a couple but
we can go back to it's very reason ah no
no no let's let's do that for now you're
all this oh holy crap yeah we have a lot
of topics okay ah yes okay explain this
the fourth one and I think that I think
that we're all going to completely
disagree with you because you're wrong
actually no it's probably probably
they'll agree with you okay so hackers
versus crackers um I brought this up
with minus today I
okay first of all we should start with
your position what would you consider
yourself just so you guys know slicks
actually a lot more technical than me
especially on the software side like I
can barely make something bold with HTML
tags um what I can't remember I can
never remember if it's like brackets and
then the slash or if it's these things
under the slash sometimes it's one
sometimes it's the other III schools
you'll be done in like ten minutes left
w3schools amazing website if you're
looking into really basic starter coding
go there even more advanced stuff
they're really good anyways I would
consider myself a hacker okay um hackers
are not bad yeah you're a bad person no
so you're basically one of those you're
one of those jackasses is in like Call
of Duty know like running around no no
wrong terminology is used almost all the
time most of the call of duty guys are
what's called the script key they're
just using programs written by other
people and those other people are
crackers crackers are people that attack
things and try to correction crackers
are white people oh go ahead crackers of
people who try to attack things and try
you why are you generalizing about my
people sorry I'm racist against white
people um I can understand that cuz
you're clearly not let yourself clearly
what was it you gonna say yeah crackers
people that will attack something
maliciously hackers are people that will
take something and try to change it in
certain ways to make it better okay but
uh do they ever do this to their own
advantage well that's kind of a point
all the time okay but is it ever to the
detriment of whoever there if it's the
detriment with someone else you're
cracking you're cracking because it
should never really influence anyone
else okay what if it was a really small
influence like what if say for example
you were gaining access to someone's
Wi-Fi or something correct and clear
woof oh you cracked into their Wi-Fi
okay what if you gained access to you
cracked the password to get into their
Wi-Fi okay
ol what if you gained access to a folder
somehow and you never actually looked at
any of the files in it are you a hacker
or crud that's gaining that's gaining
access to something that you know what
access do okay scrappy that's cracking
so what do hackers even do then besides
sit on their phones well like arduino
controllers if you ever heard of arduino
controller someone it's like little
electronic board that you can you hack
with it and make little things for
yourself said you have you made any of
those not personally but i'd like to ok
you can make like little random things
you can connect it to your washing
machine so let it female you when your
wash is done like random little stuff
like that but then I was hacking then
that's not just coding yeah but then
it's cody like there's so many different
the it's so confusing because there's a
lot of different terminology there's
also black hat gray hat and white hat
hackers and then white hat hackers at
good hackers grey hat hackers are kind
of in between and then black hat hackers
are bad and then the blue hat hackers
are leaving the ability of the monsters
and turning it around and using it on
them on i'm thinking mages yeah yeah ok
sorry but it's really confusing but yeah
that's basically this we were talking
about today ok so what so basically
hackers are mages yeah and computers are
magic and then if the blue dust if the
blue smoke comes out then the magic is
gone it has been really good they can't
working the power that comes from the
wall and your power supply is mana
master power supplies you're mad a pool
yeah he goes up for now on we no longer
do unboxings of power supplies this is
uh this is officially a 1250 watt mana
source yeah ok so to be clear if I just
hook this up to you like would that do
anything or does it have to happen sleep
well I'm like I'm like a summoner from
league legends I utilize someone who
would utilize this and the thing that I
utilize
this is the computer right right but the
computer has to contain the magic blue
smoke yeah do you contain magic blue
smoke unfortunately no are you sure cuz
I conveniently have a nice do you think
he'd hit me if I just like jabbed him
you know what what's he'd probably throw
me at the wall cuz he's a big bully okay
let's do some Twitter questions here you
can find other topics while we're
looking at some Twitter very good okay
someone loves Arduino there you go he
found died yo Shan Tanika thank you for
agreeing with slick w3schools yeah all
right Curtis what are your three
favorite games go my three favorite game
yeah that gives me favorite games
moreland Bastian Bastian and assassins
creed yeah but I'm trying to pick an
individual Assassin's Creed if i get if
i can answer series i know it's all RPGs
but the thing is with shooters with
shooters that move so quickly there's
new shooters all okay but there's no
shooter you could single out as being
like your favorite shooter like if i had
to pick a shooter i would probably say
either CS 1.6 or call duty modern
warfare call of duty 4 modern warfare
one of those two really cod 4 modern
warfare 3 favorite games I don't know
you have shooters this is all new
version after those you don't have any
like more classic games that are your
favorite games yeah I'm okay here why
don't I start with my 3 feet we didn't
have much money though I didn't get very
many games until I was quite a bit older
okay to be clear I owned for my Super
Nintendo again like we didn't we didn't
have a ton of money growing up I own
Super Mario World Final Fantasy 3 or 6
and pilot wings I actually only owned
three games for my Super Nintendo the
entire time I own the console but but
but but they were probably the best game
for that cause there's the problem is I
played so many games that I cherish so
much that it would be easier to ask like
what is your favorite game of this genre
or what is your favorite game for this
console or what is your favorite game 4
also stuff because like lost vikings
your play lost vikings i actually didn't
us my kinks was so amazing i love Spanky
those Vikings are so good we are we
owned super mario world and lost vikings
okay that was like okay super mario
world was cut you know we should get
together and we should just plow through
super mario world sometimes we could
probably stream it that would actually
be kind of amazing okay we'd love you
guys as input do you want to see me and
Slick finish 296 that's the max right I
think it's 96 I think it's 96 finish 296
super mario world in one long gaming
session let us know we can stream it we
have the behavior media cut the
AVerMedia card can streams SNES i think
there's a dongle or if not the the black
magic can cool yeah there's there's a
there's a dongle kit that comes with it
okay either way we could get a TV
without and just push l can we do that
pretty sure I'm not a hundred sure but
I'm pretty sure I want to use a CRT if
we can that would be way more than i do
know i know i know you have one mole it
like I was ok guys huge problem with
modern LCDs it drives me crazy there is
so much input leg I mean I was looking I
was looking into I PS monitors last
night yeah and found one that I was
really interested in 18 millisec just
like one but no max are meaningless
because I guarantee you that if it says
18 milliseconds it's like 50
milliseconds yeah or 80 milliseconds
yeah because the specs don't mean
anything and honestly monitors are fast
enough for me now I can get by with the
monitor like my my wife's old 2405 fpw
that one is a little bit slow for me and
the pixel response times are a little
bit slow but even my 305 T which is not
a fast monitor I can live with something
like a 24-20 t but then if you want to
have you ever noticed any problem with
it but then the leggings fast you go
back to old consoles and it almost
doesn't even matter it has to be the
shortest input lag bossman I think we
could probably play on a 120 Hertz on
120 Hertz monitor but on TVs it's
terrible like if unplayable I was
playing mario on the TV that's over
there super mario world I was like jump
adjust in midair and then it's like good
to do second later adjustment like it's
so modern games
have gotten crappier and you know what
you can't even blame it just on consoles
because Super Nintendo is a console yeah
no it'sit's the TV system it's not even
just TVs couple things input lag on TVs
hold on let me see if I have one here
yeah I don't have one wireless
controller soon wireless controllers
back when we had CRT TVs for instant yet
I feel really old right now back in my
day again grd land of scanline the
Lucian burn the fuel boilers wins my
pilot wings hai Ling Ling's was a great
game don't I know I'm not hung it down
don't be down on pilot wings through you
that's what I say oh yeah I livings is
amazing Aleppo were like crazy high-end
hardware enthusiast and our first gaming
live stream is going to be script from
work that's because super mario world is
one of the most hardcore games ever no
actually okay i still do speedruns for
it I would argue Super Mario Brothers 3
is actually harder game though but yeah
yeah but I don't think it was this good
I didn't enjoy this much it wasn't as
varied it just didn't feel as I mean I
probably doesn't help that we're a
little bit younger so you probably
played Super Mario World first I did
yeah me too so if that were the case
then there's nothing better than that
very first level of Super Mario World
getting the one up by hitting the shell
and all the things like there's that one
like upper layer of Koopas and you throw
the shell of them and you get the one up
to know there's a 3-up moon in the in
the the other first level route yeah cuz
you go back with the cape and yet again
it's it's you have to fly to get it I'd
no idea yeah anyway sorry you know what
we digress so moving right along you
know I might as well do my three
favorite game since we're at it so it'd
have to be Final Fantasy 6 yeah um which
is just 0 TIE fighter TIE fighter is
right up there that made that may be my
second all-time favorite game did you
ever idea ever
see guys okay I know I talked about this
a lot but star citizen don't look at it
go contribute I am just scream those
dude ooh I don't gonna be for a
really long time well it'll be an alpha
I think there's like NDA's and stuff but
like 2014 the game will be out we will
stream that because I am planning at
this time to drop the two hundred and
fifty dollars on the RSI course
relationship which is a multi man ship
so you have a co-pilot and a gunner in
this ship and you can like cargo freight
stuff and attack stuff and um like so
stoked um then third favorite game you
know what I actually don't know I guess
it probably wouldn't hurt okay no huh
huh like maybe something more modern
that I really enjoyed how is dad I'm
surprised you haven't mentioned Hey look
easy halo 4 pc you know i never played
it that much left for dead i played a
lot like I played it five six nights a
week 23 hours a night for like a long
time right I had like my crew and we
were playing a lot of left 4 dead so
yeah it was good it was good good stuff
okay how about the toffee of Hostess
company going into doesn't you know what
number Twinkies that's not really it's
not really up our alley but I'd love to
talk about danger den going out of
business so slick actually hadn't heard
about this until I mentioned it very
briefly I don't know if you guys know
what danger den is um but they did water
cooling water blocks they've been around
since pretty much day one of pc water
cooling going back to the the white
water i believe was their first blood oh
crap I hope I'm not I hope I'm not
making myself look stupid here I think
it was the white water I don't little
river no that was a Cathar thing
and babies crying and he's crying um so
yeah danger den they're out of business
they play blew everything out at like
thirty percent of retail oh no no the
entire thing the entire inventory was
gone within a matter of hours will do
and they're moved on to other things so
yeah that's uh that's that's very sad I
mean so yeah watercooling is so nice
though I mean yeah but to lose someone
like danger den just sucks it's been a
long time since they've been a
front-runner on anything though it still
just sucks I know yeah I was a four
brothers actually around the business so
it was like a family business and and
all that good stuff so yeah bummer but
then they were the only one left that
was still actually trying to manufacture
anything in North America which might be
might be part of our dog reason I mean
swiftech does all their production
overseas now elder blocks everything is
produced overseas EK is obviously based
out of slovenia cheap eastern european
everything except currency but it I
think they do okay um yeah tell you my
moving right along do you like the
switches on the black widow ultimate
their blues but honestly the build of
the keyboard is not my favorite they the
travel seems short like it just it
doesn't feel quite right to me one quick
show to somebody this guy's tweets at me
all the time how's it going um first
though they're they're not true blues
yeah no I didn't know that razor razors
done something with them I remember
reading a I don't own one and I've never
used one in excess I've used went a
little bit like you said yeah it's a
little bit my travel you feel a little
bit different yeah I read a huge post on
a vote on ocn polyoma skin again um huge
threat on it on ocn and if you check out
the mechanical keyboard got on ocn which
is awesome scroll all the way down and
look at different keyboards in the guide
blackwidow ultimate is one of them and
they reference the build quality of it
they
their own like you guys drug
like the gold corney's is not quite
there in my opinion but it's it's still
a nice keyboard but the keys they're
slightly different they're not really
the standard blues you look for can't
reaches Oh Robert you rascal ah ah is
there any particular reason that slick
pc has been unveiled no no not really
what's a good powerline adapter trend
that has a good one ah there four
hundred mega bed or whatever the 405 e
something oh they're they're all good oh
okay just installed something something
this is an interesting question I don't
hate anything about as rock and I mean
asking someone question like why don't
you like the products of company X if
you have owned one is sort of a pretty
self-explanatory so why don't we just
leave it at that also companies even if
you don't if even if you claim to not
necessarily like that company they can
still come up with a couple things that
are really good yeah absolutely is you
can't judge a company on a couple
different items most people have at
least something that's keeping them
alive Alan good question i wouldn't
recommend the half XB for a home server
because of the lack of three and a half
inch drive cages it's only got two not
really something that i'd consider to be
that interesting you know what here's
this is this is actually kind of a funny
funny conversation topic i jumped over
the last goodness I know but I should
know because he specifically mentioned
Twinkies okay I have never eaten a
Twinkie I've also never eaten in Turkey
maybe this is why they're going on
business I it's funny cuz I I really
like the the old 80's comic bloom County
I don't know here okay forget it I've
read a lot of comics not comic books I'm
a comic
guy really different to like newspaper
comics yeah like Foxtrot peanuts that I
you know further for worse those kinds
of clinics um and they talk a lot about
Twinkies because there's like a
cockroach character and so you know the
whole thing the only thing that survives
a nuclear holocaust ladies in courtroom
Twinkies and cockroaches ironically
Twinkies have not survived any kind of
nuclear holocaust so so yeah I just yeah
so it's just one of those weird factoids
it's like my mom has never eaten a big
mac it's just like how do you go through
life without having eaten a big mac you
know what kind of kills me is wagon
wheels hostess a lot of stuff is hostess
let's find out who made wagon wheels
wagon wheel magnetite we're gonna end up
with all kinds of stupid crap and this
search Hanson wheel and wagon shop wagon
wheel manufacturers on alibaba okay
treats yeah wagon wheel treat
manufacturer Wikipedia wagon wheels are
asked interesting these aren't available
in a lot of different places yeah
there's a wagon wheel so we're created
by something Weston something something
production in size there's a blah blah
ah the Australian equivalent Burton's
foods okay apparently not related but
did you ever have a wagon wheel when you
were a kid yeah weren't they at just a
hundred times more delicious than they
don't know yeah it tastes like crap now
to do they just taste like cardboard
yeah with like it's not yet i don't
think it's even real marshmallow anymore
which is horrible because marshmallows
are the cheapest thing on the face of
the earth how do you cheap out on
marshmallows they'll find a way I think
that comes into like everything seems to
be ever so slightly lower bilko how are
you but lower bill golden Halloween
candy this year was smaller than I've
ever seen it Kit Kats like the Halloween
kit kats used to be about this big and
they were four sticks this year they
were like this big like this long and
they're like two sticks I don't actually
remember them being forced two small
sticks oh when I when I was a little kid
they were they were for steaks
it's like okay all right yeah I guess
they're so small the arrows are tiny
arrows were like multi-segment now
they're just two segments and they're
like this big yeah and the coffee crisps

they used to be the right dimension for
a copy over like close right now they're
like these tiny little things um we're
having a really hard time staying on

topic before you joined the live streams
ah yes good question ok I'll let's
lichfield this one uh yeah there could

12 to 24 hours and then I was like I
want pro yeah no longer super excited
just want pro surface is amazing and
awesome RT surface RT surface RT sorry

Samsung yeah windows 8 yeah pretty cool
it's pretty thick and got pretty heavy
yep but it was pretty powerful and it's
pretty it's awesome being able to have
full desktop apps yeah I mean you could
I mean think about it you could run
anything on it yeah when I guess that's
heard of the point yeah thank you yeah

keep going here see if there's anything
interesting just about fiber optic wow
you suck actually Kevin Kevin I I envy
you you don't suck I just envy it it's
an honor to have my name on the show I
don't think that's the right person it
said that his actual twitter name was
dan the man was dreaming of slick pc so
played him a song called boyfriend hmm
okay
building of something something Nexus 10
and ipad 3 you know what I don't have a
nexus 10 unfortunately did you hear
about the Queen using a galaxy 10.1 no I
did not ah have any plans for doing a
custom case build no other than just
cutting holes in my own that's all I'm
really planning and then slicks already
done is oil machine which is about as
custom as it gets okay here is a here's
a helpful tip for everyone thanks for
that Inc bought two thousand alright
let's go back up what do you say we grab
another topic off the Oppo phone day I
think the main ones work through gaming
tokens gaming topics while gaming topics
are fine because technically we're on
twitchtv as people are so eager to point
out to me why are you doing a talk show
on twitchtv if you're not streaming
games and other other than my to gaming
topics we've got the inconvenience of
God's to do oh I heard black ops 2 isn't
good whew just in general the new one I
heard that I heard that there were mass
effect two discs in the box yes yes
that's actually hilarious I thought I
heard they got the wrong game that
wasn't actually just mass effect that
was I think that was at least one other
game had that problem with him like the
same time frame I don't remember who it
was but I saw it online and there's a
ton of them just the wrong disc no I
heard it was something like a million
copies or something oh yeah oh yeah huge
and bioware in response I gave out I
think I don't remember how many people
it was this just been like we're sorry
you bought black ops 2 here's a more
enjoyable came instead yeah they let
them keep it they let them a bit and
then they got another backup so I got
free mass effect 2 also an X amount of
people don't know who was that sent them
I think there's an email of a picture of
them holding their discs to from black
ops and the error screen showing that it
was mass effect got the entire suite of
mass effect games and all DLC wow yeah
that's like 123 and all DLC I guess it's
good it's good publicity for Bioware and
mass effect and as everyone's talking
about it yep yep yep in other news I've
heard halo 4 is awesome yeah actually I
I was a huge fan of halo 1 I was like
fan of halo 2 I played it forever and
then halo 3 came out and just all the
disappointment all of it I was so not
happy with that game and then reach came
out and I was like I'll try at a
friend's house go so disappointed with
three again all the disappointment was
not excited for it than halo 4 again
tried it as a friends is pretty fun
that's cool I had someone trying to tell
me that the pre game cinematics are
rendered in real time did you see them
know they're crazy they're like crazy
like gtx680 might be able to handle it
Wow yeah I was like yeah no no it isn't
like ya know good good for you but no no
um via no it's fun it's rude okay well
as our other topic do you guys hey
laporte know we we were gonna do an
unboxing at halo 4 iron box on my
livestream before you joined moku and
then I looked the disk and I gave it to
my coworker I don't think he ever found
out it's awesome okay so other than that
I've got a YouTube money manager no I'm
we shouldn't cover that okay so tomb
raider revamp i'm here too but that
it'll really no it actually looks really
good to read it ok two murders know a
lot of our coffee looks really good that
doesn't make exactly but they're trying
to get away from that their whole thing
with the new team reader is trying to
get away from that she's still obviously
attractive because she's a female main
character but they're taking a lot from
drake's fortune they're supposed to be
taking a lot from Assassin's Creed
basically rebooting the whole series
didn't they just reboot the whole series
not that long ago and remake the first
game or whatever uh it's not a remake of
the first game though it's a full reboot
they're not just like remaking stuff
they're actually changing the whole
storyline everything she's still
obviously tomb raider but like she
starts off as i don't remember exactly
what it is but it's fairly innocent and
then there's it's much more storyline
base instead of just like oh I big boobs
did he hear about how she had big boobs
and how that actually happened now the
main artist was like working on the
model for laura croft investor meaning
comes in and they come to go look at the
mall for laura croft and he mixed up the
shape for her boobs with a traffic cone
and when they thought he's like oh no
this is like the general idea of her but
her boobs are just kind of messed up
screwed that up with the traffic cone
I'll fix it right now he fixed it they
said no put it back they moved it back
to a traffic cone released the game and
it did really well you know what was the
most cruel internet rumor ever hmm that
there was a nude Raider hack for a tomb
raider because I swear like me and a
friend grade 7 or something spent like
unimaginable amounts of time trying to
find it because people claimed it was
real but that was it was all of ruse it
was not real I need a 12-year oh but no
it's seriously um I watched the video
for Tomb Raider and it actually looks
really good now and I've never been
interested in that series buy it at
launch I don't buy many things at once
okay you uh you bought him to at lunch
cuz you were excited about you bought
halo 3 at lunch probably right yeah yeah
okay but do you have any faith in the
tomb raider franchise I actually do have
some faith in tomb raider pilots see you
know the last time I bought a game at
lunch actually I bought two games around
the same time I bought bioshock 2 is a
pre-order i pre-ordered oh oh I don't
even take that info i'm sorry mr.
Preston know the good news was I had
never played bioshock and i didn't have
it and the bioshock to pre-order came
with bioshock ok so i played bioshock
all the way through mind you it was like
a fifteen dollar title by that time but
i did get some value for it they're uh
they're calling infinite the true
sequels bow shock one okay I don't think
bioshock 1 u 2 the sequel no I know but
it's not supposed to be um as far as
I've seen it's completely different
storyline it's just similar gameplay and
similar idea okay well okay the other
soul looks pretty okay the other game
that i pre-ordered at the same time was
left 4 dead 2 move left 4 dead yeah I
put so many hundreds of hours into left
4 dead one left 4 dead 2 should have
been a DLC for ten bucks fifteen bucks
maybe it's just a what was it for new
maps and different characters that
honestly I hated like I didn't like any
of them but they didn't try and hide
that though they called it
too right that's what if you do like any
minor amount of research on the game
okay yes but it was not clear before
released the extent to which it was just
a copy paste is left for dead one what
point why I think it was like with the
spinner like was two new monsters or
something and it was I was not not good
melee weapons if you care i don't know i
don't think it mattered like I don't
think an affected gameplay that much I
like I didn't really play that for dead
to you so I don't read a lot of input I
play left 4 dead one though my forehead
one was phenomenally well balanced but I
mean that's everything it's like what
it's like Team Fortress 2 I mean what's
great about it it's not innovative team
fortress has existed for years for 14
fortress two hats didn't change a whole
lot the graphics are way better the game
played did change a bit graphics being
better as an innovation but the graphics
completely changed and they scrapped the
hope they were almost done team fortress
2 and then scrapped the entire project
cuz they didn't like the style and
remade it because it was too serious
either way the balance is everything and
I didn't I yeah I just didn't like left
4 dead 2 all right let's have a look at
some new interactions here oh we're not
getting into that Jacob um Joe wants to
know how tall are you I slowed to a lot
when I'm 63 are you really 63 so he's
like nine inches taller than me but
that's okay because I got it where it
counts hahaha yeah laugh laugh all you
want one of these days we'll compare in
the live stream for twelve dollars yep
for twelve dollars wait what's this
about 1200 Bioshock do was awesome for
twelve dollars bioshock 2 was unplayable
it was totally unplayable I made it
through about 15 minutes there's like
this is terrible I'm playing through
bioshock 1 right now I have no interest
in playing bunch up to you from whatever
time to play through bioshock 1 well you
haven't edited any I besides really
playing through bioshock 1 for the last
like six months okay yeah fair enough ah
nude Raider was really claims no you
know what Adam I'm not falling for it
this time you just food vegan is real
maybe you can just okay even if it was
real would it matter I mean the pixels
were like this big you carry that
yes I care I was 12 I was 12 and like
like having having a video part at that
time that could output like 16 bit color
was a big deal you know 660ti or 7950
with new drivers you know what we're
hoping to check this out not that long
from now um because honestly right now
we don't know because they both got new
drivers that increased performance
dramatically so yeah ah Jake good
question why is everyone so excited
about Windows 8 tablets when there were
windows 7 tablets out years ago because
windows seven is terrible for touch and
they were huge yeah they were huge and
terrible I mean I'm like it comes down
to the devices like why is Windows ain't
touched so good because you have devices
like surface that are freaking awesome
and like have accurate touch screens and
multi-touch and fast interfaces windows
7 unusable they didn't have there wasn't
a huge budget in making tablets that
wasn't hordes of people going out and
buying tablets so why would a company
pour enough money to make something
awesome that's right and the problem is
like a Windows 7 tablet you couldn't
even take ok windows 8 tablet you take
for granted its capacitive multi-touch
yeah windows 7 tablets i mean like you
might have multitouch or you might have
single point touch and it might not be
accurate at all it was more like an ish
thing for like contractors who must have
a tablet so um Lou asks why do I not
live stream to YouTube I am a YouTube
partner I am a YouTube partner I don't
live stream to YouTube because it's
terrible and the quality is terrible so
I might as well stream here and then
upload it to YouTube after I haven't
painted my case again yet but it's going
to cost me a couple hundred bucks
opinion on H is I skew AMD cards well
they're made by H is and they have ice
cube coolers on them which are quiet and
they're AMD cards I mean there's not a
whole lot to say these days the board
partners aren't able to differentiate in
that many ways hi fabian yow thank you
i'm glad to hear i offends in Asia too
why didn't you and slick play black ops
don't you
trackers like all the people i can give
you a finalist invite i don't understand
do you understand Oh is he asking why we
don't torrent it or something I think so
oh well because we buy games I hope
fuck-ups to do you have black ops 2 why
do you have black ops 2 Harrison bought
it for me from ruthie oh right you're
like hey my head doesn't work oh yeah he
has a faffing injury no what's the last
live stream if you want to know what
happened man yeah you can watch him into
it hahaha yeah see oil can you compute
local computers are a bad idea how did
you wash your money word when you took
apart the oil cooled machine I didn't
bother district credit I didn't need it
right away so it's like and how long
does it take I left it for a while okay
like a week so we're rounding okay it
was ready pretty good like I could have
used it right away it would have just
dripped more cuz well doesn't come off
stuff very quickly will a 200 watt power
supply be enough for a custom nas box ie
small form factor with four or six hard
drives I'll let you field that one I'm
gonna run to the washer yes okay you
might have to find the discussion talk
oh okay give me one moment guys I think
I've got one more on you okay massive
League of Legends changes he probably
wouldn't care about this anyway so I'll
jump into it right now I don't know how
many viewers are inter league legends
but considering it's a massive freaking
game sure tons of you are if you guys
haven't check this out yet go to
surrender at Tony dotnet i believe it is
or just google surrender at 20 you'll
find it they have the posts for tons of
new items tons of item changes like
revamped items new items new item tears
boots are getting huge changes they're
taking 25 speed through it like across
the board off all of the boots and
adding it to champions there's no tears
three boots but what the tier 3 boots
are is they're actually enchantments
that you put on your boot so it's not
like you buy another tier that only like
is a linear tier there's I think five
different types of enchantments that you
can place however you want on any of the
boots I'm trying to remember some of
them alacrity increases your movement
speed there's another one I don't
remember the names of all these but one
of them increase your speed well in
combat one of them increases your
teammates movement speeds while they're
moving towards you I think that one's
called captain as a bunch of other ones
there's some minor map changes a huge
huge patch coming fairly soon I think
it's on the test from right now so yeah
sounds fascinating if steam makes their
own OS would it be as popular as Linux I
think it would be much less popular than
Linux unless there's like a dedicated
device that they're gonna sell on the
cheap that like runs it or something
yeah but if steam makes our own OS it's
probably gonna be Linux well that Miss
Teen wouldn't make in her last valve
would make an OS well what yeah but like
it but if they whatever to say if they
did well I was just going up with what
he said anyways if they did it would
probably be linux anyways and it's
probably be their own adaptation of
Linux brendan says hi Linus I wish I was
on your Twitter list on your live stream
okay Brendan ah yes but you have to
replace it once in a while ah don't know
I think it's probably close I should be
a little bit better than Linfield coffee
crisp are awesome and Wonder bars an old
Dutch ketchup chips are awesome too with
this whoa josh hasn't reached 4 million
today yeah I don't think it displays on
their Kickstarter page cuz kisser does
doesn't show all of their forms no but I
didn't look at that I looked at Robert

don't get a billion emails yeah you
haven't actually bought it yet no I
haven't bought it i buy it you get
constant updates yeah over 4 million

now yeah they went from 125 miles per
second rights to 150 megabytes
second rights and they went from yeah
and that was about the same for beads
yeah the scaly was where the same so it
was about an outright twenty percent
improvement in performance yeah like
across the board which is awesome I know
they come with 3d bones yeah which means
they don't vibrate and they shouldn't
theory last longer yep and now they have
a way more advanced head technology now
it's similar to what wt's been using an
enterprise drives which is a cool one
terabyte platters which is good for your
moving parts is always better for
mechanical things I mean look how many
moving parts you haven't looked i
defective you are put your arm look at
