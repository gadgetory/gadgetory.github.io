2017 possible for us this year check
them out in the link down below this is
the event 'im 3 it is beautiful it is
huge is incredibly powerful and I'm not
talking about it today today I'm going
to be talking about project Medina this
is a prototype case so it's it's not
completely ready there's some things
that will be changing I've tried to
throw in my two cents for what they can
do and there's a couple things that they
already had on the block in its current
configuration it has an Asus Z 270 Strix
board and i7 7700 k2 GTX 1080s
32 gigs of corsair dominator ram some
Thermaltake ring fans and a whole bunch
of EK water cooling but if you don't go
for like fully to the tilts builds you
can get this one down to about 1500 or
even maybe below with this same chassis
in terms of cooling all that awesome
gear you can configure it to have up to
a three by 120 or 3 by 140 in the top
and in the front you can get a 2 by 120
or 2 by 140 this current configuration
is using both as you can see there's
already a ton of lighting and RGB zones
and all that awesomeness but they're
going to have a new lighting controller
on the way which will add more zones
including like the digital storm logo
just on the inside of the case and I'm
hoping the SSD Bay in the back and maybe
even some more will just have to wait
and see speaking of that SSD area on the
right side of the case it's an
interesting idea when compared to some
people that are revealing the whole
right side of the case but then you've
got some messy cables and stuff this
just puts your beautiful SSDs on display
for the world to see in terms of i/o on
the top you have wonderful power and
resets which is I don't know if these
are vandal switches specifically but
they feel great on the other side you
have a full size SD card reader and a
micro SD card reader which I'm sure the
editors here would enjoy headphone and
microphone jacks 2 USB 3.1 gen2
a ports 1 USB 3.1 gen2 type-c ports
those names get fairly long and an hdmi
2.0 port if you want to plug VR headsets
up into the top instead of on the back
of your case if you are interested in
configuring your own version of project
Madinah check out digital storms website
in fall of the
year thank you to our dank sponsor D
brand for bringing us to CES 2017 this
year they have a ton of different
options for skins for your devices like
my pixel right now that has their
marbled skin on it also all of our
laptops that we got for Christmas all
the razor blades all have different
configurations of skins on there if you
want to make it your own similar to how
you might configure one of these
computers you can go to de brands
website and configure your own skin
layout for your own device check them
