another lengthened physical comparison
so this is the Nvidia reference GeForce
GTX 560 and I'm going to show you just
how long it is and what are the odds
it's going to fit in your case compared
to a couple of other popular GPUs on the
market so I'm going to flip it over
which is going to make it a little bit
easier to measure due to the shape of
the shroud and let's do this card first
I actually haven't done this off camera
so I have no idea and it's just a hair
over nine inches long so nine and one
I guess that's 1/16 nine and 1/16 so the
first thing we should compare that
against is its direct competition in the
market which is the Radeon 6870 so this
one this is a funny decision to make
because you can see AMD has actually put
a longer shroud on this card than the
length of the PCB so they've actually
made it longer than it actually is so
for this guy what we're going to end up
with is nine and 7/8 inches so it has a
slight advantage in size over the 6870
now the next card in our little informal
test here is going to be a gtx 570 this
one is going to weigh in at a whopping
ten and nine sixteenths of an inch so
it's got a full inch plus over the gtx
560 reference card and then last but not
least I'm going to also show for
comparison the Radeon 69 70 okay so this
one is almost 11 inches so 10 and 10 and
3/4 I guess that is so something to bear
in mind about this comparison here is
that the GTX 570 is also exactly the
same physically as the GTX 580 and that
also goes for the 69 70 which is exactly
the same size as the 69 50 bearing in
mind that these are all reference cards
so if there's any aftermarket coolers or
aftermarket PCB designed ones they can
be slightly different so the GTX 560 is
truly a lightweight in terms of its
stature but a
huge a view eight in terms of its
performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
