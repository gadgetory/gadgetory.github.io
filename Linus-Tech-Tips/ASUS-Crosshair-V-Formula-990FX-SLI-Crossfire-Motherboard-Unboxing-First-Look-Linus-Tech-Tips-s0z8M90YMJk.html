for formula this is a 990 X motherboard
it's an AMD motherboard it's the
crosshair branding on the Republic of
gamers it is compatible with all the
latest am-3 CPUs and that one's got
thermal contact all over it not going to
show that off too much but it is also
compatible with upcoming am3+ CPUs so
that means we're going to be able to put
so far undisclosed unreleased CPUs into
this motherboard with no complications
very very cool so socket am3+ supports
32 nanometer CPU up to 8 cores ok well
they're going to go ahead and say it
then it's cool and quiet up to 140 watt
CPU support here we go 3 PCI e 2.0 16x
so add up to 16 dual 16x or 16 8 8 so
that means you got full support for 3
way graphics technologies using PCIe 8 X
native bandwidth for all three which
means you're not going to see any
performance degradation supports a 3-way
nvidia sli and crossfire x technology
okay we've got support for six a two
three six gigabit per second ports as
well as an additional as media
controller with giving us an external 6
a 2 6 gigabit per second so the eSATA on
this board is actually say 2 3 6 gigabit
per second that's kind of cool
so if you had like a super high-speed
SSD as an external drive you could get
the most out of it ok Intel Gigabit LAN
that's kind of interesting on an AMD
board but yeah I support that decision
Intel LAN is very well-regarded
and we have an AZ media USB 3 controller
giving us 4 at the back and two at the
mid board ok let's go ahead and get this
guy opened up and I guess I spoiled my
big surprise on the back there and that
is that yes this board has full support
for nvidia sli technology on an AMD
chipset Wow so supports crossfire X and
SLI it's got ROG connect which means you
can plug in to an external computer and
you can
control the settings of the board itself
it has extreme engine digi+ which is
their combination of analog and digital
design elements for the PWM it's got
game first which is the Intel Ethernet
which is in theory lower latency and
faster supreme FX X 5 - ok and that
pretty much does it out includes daemon
tools interesting I like daemon tools
good my free copy that with my
motherboard ok so open this baby up and
see what we got for you so we have six a
two three six gigabit per second cables
that saw they are all straight to right
angle
- all right angle cables crossfire
bridge SLI bridge this still amuses me
that there's s alot compatibility on
this board we have Q connectors so that
is for the front panel headers as well
as one of the front USB - headers we got
some zip ties included you got an i/o
shield with their puffy shiny backing on
it we have a crosshair five formula
series user guide as well as a drivers
and utilities DVD download the latest
from the Seuss website we also have
their handy cable labels so when you're
bundling cables and routing them all
somewhere you won't lose track of which
is which when you're plugging them into
your drive we've got a Quick Start Guide
we have one of those huge ROG stickers
that your I guess you put on the side of
your case yeah I'm not not real sold on
the ROG sticker it's all good we got a
3-way SLI bridge included and finally
the ROG connect cable which is just a
straight USB a to a cable now let's have
a look at the board itself so this is as
with all of a Seuss's rog republic of
gamers boards it is a very high-end
board it looks high-end it feels
high-end and it performs high-end you
can take that to the bank
this thing actually looks great this is
one of the better-looking ROG boards
that I have that I have ever seen so why
don't we start with the CPU socket area
so here you can see we have a black
socket they're calling it a and 3b so
this is an am3+ socket it is fully
compatible with am3+ CPUs as indicated
by the black color we also have the
standard AMD
mounting mechanism around it although
you can see it's missing those those
pieces of plastic that bridge it
together no big deal it uses the same
mounting holes the same mounting clips
this is going to be fully compatible
with pretty much any AMD CPU cooler
going back several socket generations we
have a really slick looking PWM cooler
here with a heat pipe running down the
middle of it so it's got a kind of a
matte black and anodized red finish to
it it looks really good so you can
actually see the chipset down there so
this is cooling both the chipset as well
as the PWM now this I haven't seen yet
so I have an 8 pin CPU power connector
and it's ideal location on the top left
edge of the board and I also have a four
pin so it looks like a soos is allowing
you to deliver a tremendous amount of
power to the CPU socket but they have
not opted to go with dual eight pins
which we have seen on some high-end
boards in the past so there's probably a
reason for it but there you go so you've
got one 8 pin and one 4 pin CPU power
connector ok I'm going to do all the fan
headers later because there seems to be
a ton of them we've got a go button
we've got four dual channel ddr3 slots
so these are easy install slots which
means there's no clip on the one side
you slide the module in like this push
it down clip it in just like that
alright here we've got our 24 pin
connector in its ideal location along
the right-hand edge and there's the mid
board USB 3 connector so this is a great
location for this I very much prefer
this to having it down here because this
is closer to the front of your case
which is where it should be alright we
have 6 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second ports
that are running off of the AMD control
which is under this heatsink and then we
have this one running off of a custom
chip so that's a third-party chip I
would use all of these before I go and
use this one here's our front panel
connectors so your power switch your
LEDs all that good stuff we've got 2 USB
2.0 front panel connectors we've got an
over C button we have a start and reset
switch built in love these these are
very handy for me and then we have front
panel audio here's the x5 supreme FX and
moving up we've also got this which is
good this is a four pin auxilary power
connector if you're actually going to
load four
six cards or even three into this board
you should probably be using this okay
we have an ROG connect switch over here
so what that is for is for using the
external computer to change settings on
your board so you'll just turn that on
you plug into the ROG connect port right
there this is not a normal USB port and
it's off to the races now this board has
six expansion slots total so you can see
the top slot spot is empty you've got
four PCIe 16x slots so these are capable
of running at up to 16 8 X 8 X 4 3-way
SLI or crossfire you have one PCIe 1x
slot one PCI slot in addition to those
and I did promise to tell you guys about
all of the four pin fan headers on this
board there's a ton there's one two
three four up here in the top right
corner okay then there's one two down
here up three down here along the bottom
edge so that's six point seven so far
and finally one at the back here for
your chassis fan so that's eight four
pin pwm fan controllers outstanding
alright let's have a look at the i/o
shield at the back we got four USB 3.0
ports so that is a total of six one ps2
keyboard mouse combo port a clear CMOS
button this is the best place in the
world for a clear CMOS button big fan
okay we've got one two three four five
six seven USB 2.0 ports eSATA that's
running say two three six gigabit per
second I remind you optical audio out
more USB 3 the rog connect the intel
Gigabit LAN and then do those look
gold-plated we got gold plated 7.1 audio
outs what that means is these are going
to be more robust more durable
connectors than you would see if they
were not gold plated the mounting
mechanism for the chipset and PWM heat
sinks is outstanding we've actually got
back plates on here that are using
thermal interface material to in all
likelihood interface with thermal heat
producing components on the back of the
board we've also got a nice robust metal
AMD backplate to go along with the
plastic clips on the front so those are
going to be very very solid thank you
