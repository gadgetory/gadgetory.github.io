DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts so how fast is a
hard drive compared to an SSD I mean you
can go read a spec sheet or look at the
charts and graphs on fantastic sites
like storage review but if you look
carefully there's something you'll
notice about the way that SSDs and hard
drives always get compared to each other
it always starts with the reviewer
loading up a fresh OS putting on all the
latest drivers and installing only the
applications that are needed for
benchmarking so what we're seeing is the
best-case scenario for any device but
that's not the way that people actually
use their computers they get malware and
remove it they install programs and I
install them and but that leaves
remnants they upgrade their hardware and
the older driver junk is left over and
they have random crap running in the
background that they don't even remember
the purpose of so while a sanitized
scientific approach is the best way to
objectively measure the performance of a
hardware what it isn't is a way to
represent to people what the real
difference in performance between a hard
drive and an SSD might look like to
three or however many years down the
road when the hard drive is gonna be
really struggling to keep up with all
that clutter something that SSDs handle
much much better so Luke and I sat down
and divinest a test to show the other
end of the spectrum the worst case
scenario for both devices for science in
the hard drive corner we've got a
Seagate Barracuda one terabyte that has
had this Windows 7 operating system more
on that later running on it for almost 5
years representing SSDs we've got the
Corsair Neutron 512 we went with this
drive because we feel like it represents
a good balance between price performance
and capacity something that we need
because our hard drive was about
half-full to begin the test and we
wanted to be able to clone everything
over there which leads us into the
methodology that Windows 7 installed is
one broken piece of poo it's running an
IDE mode it has undergone several
platform changes between
originally being installed on m-46 and
the x79 bench that we're using today
it's dual booted with fortified linux
distros with a variety of boot loaders
used throughout it and a triple boot
setup with Linux and OS 10 attempted at
one point and it's run every generation
of Nvidia graphics cards from the 8800
series to the 7000 series and the
objective of all of this is to determine
once and for all is there more to the
SSD performance story than boot times on
a fresh OS can an SSD actually justify
its much higher cost to storage ratio
even for affordable ones like this one
in a worst-case scenario torture tests
have all of those people who upgraded
just been deluding themselves about how
much better things were when they cloned
their old OS to a new SSD to find out
what kind of difference a hard drive
user might observe in the real world
this is what we did take it away loop to
elaborate on what Linus was talking
about this operating system has been
through kind of a lot it wasn't just a
test drive this was actually my daily
driver for a long time and because of
that I've done registry edits like crazy
I played with boot animations I've duel
booted it beside everything under the
Sun it's gone through every series of
nvidia card and a lot of AMD ones since
8000 series Nvidia it started mine in
four six and I've tried a whole bunch of
different platforms on AMD and Intel
size since then um yeah it was sat at
the top of my mineral oil rig I've had
it since high school it's been through
basically everything as far as I can
remember and we're gonna see how it
fares so the first thing I did was I
booted up on the X 79 platform
I ran Windows Update for a while which
took freakin forever I downloaded
installed all the latest drivers and
necessary benchmarking software that I
needed
I then cloned the drive over to the SSD
with both drives running the same
Frankenstein absolutely crap worst is
possible scenario operating system the
only thing left was to see the
performance difference between the
hardware in this kind of torture test
scenario our first benchmark is going to
be based around restarting so I clicked
the restart button and instantly start
timeing at that
point let me time it until it gets all
the way through reboot and is able to
open PC mark 8 modern West's are
optimized for hard drives hybrid drives
SSDs whatever in terms of booting and
that's why your new PC boots up so
quickly that didn't really help here a
ton as you'll see our next test was to
uninstall a program' I chose OpenOffice
for this and the objective was to see
how long it takes to uninstall this
program while using the computer in the
background so while it was running this
I was opening control panel looking at
different things and just random web
browsing a - tech tips com about every
five ish seconds I would do a new action
that was about it and it took a really
long time for the hard drive time to
stall that program last off I tried to
run PC mark 8 and it ran fine on the SSD
but it crashed on the hard drive I
really don't think that's PC mark eights
problem the hard drive probably just
screwed up to be completely honest so we
didn't bother including those results
because they're inconclusive Thank You
future mark for providing the code
anyways I'm sure if my hard drive wasn't
as screwed up it would probably work
just fine so instead of running that
test what I did was I made it calculate
all the folders within my C Drive to see
how long that took and that was again
kind of a fairly hilarious result
alright guys I hope you liked this kind
of like odd weird contrast II situation
we just kind of noticed that I had this
hard drive since forever and just wanted
to kind of see what we could do with it
so I hope you guys liked that if you did
like it like the video and subscribe if
you didn't like it dislike the video and
subscribe anyways we'll make something
you like eventually comment on them down
below if you think it was an interesting
test if you want to comment in a more
highbrow section of the internet you can
comment over at Linus tech tips calm and
let us what you know what you think over
there just so you guys know we recently
launched the beta of our kind of front
page II idea that we're hoping to do
soon so if you want to see that jump
over on the forum and click the front
page beta don't worry we're gonna make
it so you can set your homepage to be
whatever you want so if you want to have
it so you home pages of the forum that
would be okay but that functionality
isn't quite ready yet thanks for
watching if you guys want a shirt that
isn't from Firefox for whatever reason
you can check our shirts links down in
the description below thank you for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
