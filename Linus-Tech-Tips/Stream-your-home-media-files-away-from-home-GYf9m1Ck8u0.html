many others I took a lot of flack over
my recent video showing how you can buy
older second-hand hardware to build
yourself a more capable nas or network
attached storage box some of the
criticism very valid power consumption
is a bigger consideration for people who
live in areas where electricity is
generated by burning dinosaur remains
although I did address that in the video
but others seemed to be born out of an
assumption that the only thing an AZ
device or a file server does is store
files for backup and occasional access
they can do that and if that's all you
could ever want with limited room for
growth then even the cheapest Synology
or QNAP or WD box will take care of you
just fine but there is a whole wide
world of use cases out there beyond that
and I decided to make this video about
one of my favorite things to do with a
more robust Nazz streaming media -
portable devices both within and outside
of my house
Corsair boasts unrivaled comfort and
universal compatibility on its new void
surround headset featuring a genuine
Dolby 7.1 headphone USB adapter check
the link in the video description to
learn more unless everything that you
watch is available on a streaming
service of some kind and the people in
your house are considered enough not to
hog all the bandwidth it is not always
convenient to transfer the media that
you want to watch to your phone I mean
depending on video codec compatibility
and processing requirements and even
just file sizes on the limited storage
capabilities of modern devices it can be
a bear to deal with so let's check out a
couple of solutions that use a computer
that you own or anaz to transcode or
convert from one video format to another
on the fly and stream it over Wi-Fi or
even over the Internet to your device
number one it's more functional more
widely recognized and broadly compatible
but also the more complicated in some
ways Plex to get started with Plex
you'll need to go through a few steps
number one get the plex media server
application it's free and available for
the PC a wide variety of Naslund errs
like Synology and thickest and
standalone as operating systems like on
raid which is where I'm using it then
you'll need the five dollar Plex app
installed on some kind of a client
device be it a smart TV and iPad an
Android phone or whatever the case may
be then for the best possible experience
you're going to want to create a free
Plex account login those devices and as
long as you are on the same network and
you've installed a program before in
your life you should be pretty much good
to go so then let's jump into what I
like about Plex it is beautiful like
just beautiful once you add your video
content to it Plex automagically pulls
metadata for things like trailers DVD
covers plot synopses theme music cast
information and more and it looks
awesome in addition to that for content
that you don't
we have there's the channels some of
these are strictly region-locked like
the BBC iplayer which is kind of a
bummer but there is some great content
in here that I would otherwise not have
access to for nothing like all the South
Park episodes as well as Comedy
Central's channel and then finally the
best thing about plex IMO is the broad
compatibility music movies TV pretty
much any format of those things Under
the Sun and if you've got a modern
device the odds of there being a plex
server or a client for it I mean even if
it's just a standard DLNA client with
reduced functionality compared to the
fully featured plex app is pretty darn
good now we get into what I don't really
like about plex it can be a bit of a
bear to set up and maintain your media
library I mean sure if you can handle
forwarding a port in your router and
operating system then remote access over
the Internet which some apps i've used
before like II met have trouble with for
some reason is easy I'm in the office
running this demo off of my five megabit
uplink server at home but remember that
asterisk on automatically pulling show
information before if you're not
diligent about where you put your media
within the write library and you don't
title things correctly then this stuff
can be wildly inaccurate I mean look at
all these episodes of America's Funniest
Home Videos that ah wait a minute I
don't know any America's Funniest Home
Videos DVDs it got confused by a bunch
of random video clips that we're sitting
in a TV shows folder oops on top of that
there are some plex features that don't
work unless you're willing to fork out
for a $40 yearly subscription I mean
even ones that don't require Plex to use
any storage or processing power on their
side like mobile sync a fantastic
feature that transcodes the video file
to a mobile-friendly format and stores a
copy of that on your device for use when
you're stuck without internet access
which I guess leads us pretty well into
solution number two of the day err video
HD this one has all
lot going for it it's fully unlocked
with a one-time app purchase which okay
the asterisk again they do offer early
access features for another four dollars
and in method did pull that dick move of
discontinuing the original air video
forcing me to rebuy it in HD that one
time but it's server is extremely light
and easy to configure with meaningful
errors if you have issues with windows
firewall or port forwarding and it's got
a simple pic the folders you want to
share interface going into the app
navigation and video buffer speed is
freaking amazing with air video the
real-time scrubbing preview is slick as
hell actually still pretty much works if
you can get past the darkening of the
screen even though I haven't paid for
early access to it and the transcode and
preload to device feature is a great way
to pack content with you on a vacation
or business trip you just pick the
quality press the button and boom it
transfers over Wi-Fi or even over the
Internet
to your phone so in a nutshell while it
lacks support for music and doesn't pull
thumbnails or plot synopsis information
or whatever it just plain works navigate
the folder tree to the file you want
press play no dunking around
as for the disadvantages of air video HD
hmm wonder where I would start with oh I
know
compatibility while video format support
is stellar since it's actually powered
by a separate installation of VLC the
server is only fully supported on Mac
and Windows and much worse than that
the client is only available on iOS a
method what the hell your stupid app is
my response to all those people
pestering me on social media asking hey
Linus why do you still have that nasty
old iPhone 4 anyway well because I
needed as a beter air video player
please take care of this with the web or
Windows app and an Android app I would
happily buy both of them
use nothing else including my very
distant bronze metal solution Amit Amit
is basically like a rusty broken-down
air video on the Android side it's the
same kind of barebone server
configuration pointed at the folder and
share the folder the same folder based
navigation and the same one-time
purchase business model but
unfortunately it just works great for
some people and is total arse for others
I've always had good luck with it in the
past which is why I included it in this
video but then when I went to put it on
my test machine to get screen capture of
using it to make this video
it completely cacked out on me so I
guess the two years of zero development
on it have finally caught up with it
which I guess leads me into the part of
the video that would normally be the
conclusion except there isn't really one
here so I'll address the elephant in the
room instead - you've got a pretty
public anti-piracy stance and as a
content creator I can understand that so
why are you showing us how to do this
because legality aside I don't find
anything morally wrong with this my
media server is accessible to me and my
wife only though frankly I don't think
she knows how to use it anyway so I
think it's ridiculous that if I own a
DVD of a show or a blu-ray of a movie or
whatever that I have to hike up to my
attic to go get it since that's where
optical discs belong I&amp;amp;O put it into a
player wait a bazillion years then
finally settle in to enjoy the content
what switching discs multiple times in
the middle of a season or to watch the
special features no I reject your
reality I substitute my own
so there you go while I can't recommend
it I rip content using any DVD and make
MKV and I play it back using the
software that I talked about today it
works awesome it's a better experience
for content that I paid for and I
frankly don't feel bad about it at all
and on that subject ting
the mobile carrier that's focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction first get this when you
call them there's no robot yes my
friends a world where the humans talked
to the other people
I was actually kind of blown away I did
it just to try it and I was like hello
and they were like hello like I almost
didn't know what to do because I
expected to press one for sales and
service because that's the most
important thing press two for something
else press three for this press nine for
customer service no not that and the
other great thing about ting is that you
pay only for what you use with an
average bill totaling only about twenty
four dollars per month per device if
you're stuck in a contract and you want
to switch to ting they'll cover 25% of
your cancellation fee up to $75 so all
you got to do is head over to linus dot
ting comm to try out their savings
calculator where you enter your last few
bills and how much you're paying and
find out how much you'd save on ting
