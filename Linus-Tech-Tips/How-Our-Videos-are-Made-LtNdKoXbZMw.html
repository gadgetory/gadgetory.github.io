making a sponsored video for their new
flex 5 lineup of powerful toon ones like
this one these are great for creative so
we thought well hey why not show our
actual use case for devices like this
here at limas Media Group
so advil actually just recently upgraded
from having just a desktop PC and a pad
of paper to having a lenovo tune one and
we figured well since its ads job to be
involved with everyone else's job why
not do a behind-the-scenes of how our
videos get made so without further ado
then I give you a day in the life of
editor extraordinaire and professional
cat herder Etzel Iago
we release a video every single day
including weekend and that takes a lot
of planning and management because each
video has lots of people doing different
jobs over a period of several days it's
my job to know at what stage of the
process
each video is at at all times and to
coordinate everyone so our videos get
released on time it's not always easy
there's construction things breaking
people breaking things and top-secret
products that have to be announced at
exactly the right time the Week starts
with me telling the writing team how
many videos need to be made that we hit
our target and not be screwed the next
week which can happen if someone goes on
vacation or if hardly orders arrived
broken hey you guys think we can do
eight videos positivity then all the
projects are added to our video tracker
spreadsheet which contains all the
deadlines in progress info for all our
projects we use fancy conditional
formatting to make the colors change
automagically then the video status is
updated and we use the exact same
project names here on the server and on
the calendar so that every part of the
project is easy to find no matter where
you're looking this is where I start
cracking the whip I harass the writers
to update me on their progress so that I
can schedule a time for them to sit down
with Linus for script review the more
people we hire the tougher it is to get
one-on-one time with Linus but at the
same time these script reviews even
though they can take as long as an hour
or more have become more important than
ever to ensure that even though the
Linus is written less than 25% of our
videos this year all our content still
maintains the consistent style dick
jokes and all
and everyone here sometimes I get to eat
my lunch sometimes the first major
handoff is from the writers to the
shooters but people behind the camera I
assign one shooter to film a role that's
the footage of the host talking and
another shooter to film the b-roll
that's all the other footage you see
like shots of the product or silly skits
or whatever and next time you see a
product appear in five to eight
locations consider that it can take up
to 45 minutes to wipe the fingerprints
off the product set up the two to six
lights being use and wrangle up any
actors you may need hello Hollywood
I'd like one actor please the writers
meet with a b-roll shooter to
collaborate on the visuals that will
accompany the hosts voiceover by the
time this meeting is over nearly the
entire scripts will have what we call
guidance and we call it that because
it's a suggestion for how it should be
done we don't want to take all the
creative freedom away from the folks
further down the production chain
Brandon and max are irregular shooters
but if we're in a hurry sometimes I just
grab whoever's available since most of
our editors are actually pretty handy
behind the camera - hey I need someone
to shoot something real quick Dennis I
know you're not doing anything let's go
I'm busy
next the shooters have to ingest their
footage putting it in a specific
location on our server for the next
people in the assembly line the editors
will know where to look for it a lot
more went into hooking up our ingest
stations than just hooking up an SD card
reader we're able to ingest footage at
200 to 300 megabytes per second keep
your eyes peeled for an upcoming video
all about our ingest process and server
infrastructure upgrades once all the
shots are on the server the editors can
get to work putting it all together we
use the writers guidance they don't
range all the shots and of course add
their own flair some of which is subtle
and some of which is pretty obvious but
it's not always smooth sometimes the
editors find out that a shot is too
short compared to the voiceover or maybe
the hosts miss votes or some shots are
just white
missing then we'll have to find someone
available to shoot a pickup so the
editor can keep working after turn pulls
an all-nighter and uses all 200 of his
macro keys finishing up the video time
for quality control the writers sits
down with the editor and reviews the
video to make sure the information is
accurate and that no unreleased products
or email addresses accidentally wind up
in the background then another editor
usually mirror Karen reviews it for
glitches and then finally assuming we
can find them
Linus reviews it and finally it's time
for you guessed it our wonderful
thumbnails we try to shoot these on the
green screen and then use Photoshop to
make them more how you say clickable
before posting them online and that's it
big thanks to Lenovo for sponsoring this
hold on a minute edge and mention
anything about the sales team this video
won't even be tough yeah sales people
