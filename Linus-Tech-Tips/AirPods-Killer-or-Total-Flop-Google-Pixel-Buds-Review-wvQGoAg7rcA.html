features exclusive to pixel phones and
they're priced at 159 making them pretty
much the Android equivalent to Apple's
air pods but are these even close to as
good and can they deliver on their
promise of offering magical real-time
translation just like they did in the
scripted onstage demo I think kind of
blue would suit you alright we will see
math drops best-selling Sennheiser HD
6xx headphones are available again for
only 200 US dollars so check them out at
the link in the video description first
things first the pixel buds are not
truly Wireless but unlike some other
neck buds like the j-bird freedoms
there's no battery bump or inline
control everything is contained within
the earbuds themselves so why then does
this cable exist at all well it's
actually integral to the buds design
starting with the fin the loop formed at
the cables end actually goes inside ish
your ear and then can be adjusted for a
nice snug fit and to keep them in in
practice it causes a little bit more
faffing about to put them in if the
cable slips but it works surprisingly
well to hold them in place and being
able to hang them around your neck it
could be argued is a convenient way to
keep track of them and besides if you
prefer truly Wireless pixel buds you can
just DIY it any way by cutting the I'm
just kidding
not only would cutting off the cable
void your warranty you'd also be totally
screwed because the cable does conduct
audio signals
not to mention power the buds 5 hour one
20 milliamp hour battery is completely
contained within the left bud and is not
split between the two earphones like
with apples air pods to charge the
battery you will need the included
charging case it is not as small or
convenient or premium feeling as the air
pods case I have some doubts about its
long-term durability and the lip around
the edge is pretty stupid okay I
actually you know what I don't like it
very much but the process of putting the
buds in is about as good as it could be
considering that there's a cable to deal
with and it includes a magic pairing
mechanism similar
two apples provided that you're running
Android nougat and that you have a
little bit of luck but let's just take
them back out and use them compared to
the air plots which only have one
gesture which can be remapped depending
on your preference per Budd to pause
skip track or summon Siri Google's
offers less flexibility at this time but
it does support more gestures thanks to
a capacitive surface that is built into
the right bud so you can actually tap to
play and pause you can double tap to
have notifications read to you you can
swipe to adjust volume and you can hold
it to summon the Google assistant which
by the way is awesome on the pixel buzz
the instant you touch the button no
latency or even an acknowledgment tone
you can just start talking what's the
price of Bitcoin ordering it to play
songs get directions or even send text
messages something that isn't supported
on the Google home yet sorry I can't
send text yet oh and one more thing how
about that real-time translation now two
months ago Dennis and I tried out a
different product with that same promise
and the results were how do we put this
tactfully totally broke dick okay so now
I'm actually not very certain if it's
working properly so let's see if Google
can do any better today
you're not Dennis can you get Dennis ok
so you ready to try again
you kill me
hello it is very nice to meet you oh
yeah audience ooh wow it went through a
lot of different iterations there how
are now woman true canteen he's yummy
all kinds of Mortier why is it that
whenever we try to do one of these
scenarios we end up dating Hoshi woman
silly mean Tom to tea yatta eat children
okay so alright thanks Dennis
there are some good things here umm I
don't speak this is based on Google
Translate rather than whatever that
broken thing we were using before was so
the translations are actually pretty
good but a couple of issues first of all
this functionality with the pixel buds
only works with the pixel or pixel 2
series of phones and what was the point
of that what was the difference between
using pixel buds and just using Google
Translate
so okay let's move on to the one more
fairly important thing that we have to
discuss here how do the pixel buds sound
actually not bad compared to the air
pods they have a wider soundstage and
are more full-bodied definitely less
tinny meaning I would say they sound
better than the air pods overall with
that said despite all of our comparisons
between the two here the buds aren't
really competing with the air pods
anyway even though they can totally work
with an iPhone including Siri
integration what they're competing with
is all the other Bluetooth headphones
that an Android user might buy in the
post headphone jack era and as long as
your device supports the features that
you want to use with them and you don't
mind the relatively cumbersome in our
experience pairing and easier insertion
process I think they are a pretty good
choice you know what else is a good
