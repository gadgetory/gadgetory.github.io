from a couple of other popular BitFenix
products first they borrow their style
from BitFenix this very first case the
colossus and second they borrow their
interior design from the prodigy and the
prodigy m the cooler master glazier 240
L CPU cooler delivers the convenience of
an all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more you'll be used to this form factor
if you've ever used a prodigy but of
course it does like I said borrow from
the Colossus in terms of the styling so
it has a bit of an upward angled shape
to the top cover here and then it has a
bit of an angular helmet like shape to
the front that gives it a more
aggressive look than something like the
prodigy ventilation is handled through
just these vents on the top for the
front giving access to fresh air to the
five and a quarter inch drive bay that
has been turned into ventilation as well
as the 140 millimeter sized vent in the
front so the airflow is not going to be
exceptional compared to some versions of
this type of case that have larger vents
but it should be adequate for what most
people install in n ATX or mini ITX
system also on the front we find a piece
of plastic as well as a bit Fenix logo
more on the piece of plastic in just a
moment on the right hand side we do not
find that same nice soft touch finish
that's on the top and the front but just
a more standard painted steel finish two
USB 3.0 ports microphone headphone jack
reset and power switches then on the
left hand side we find not a whole lot
of anything on the top not only that
soft touch touch finish that I talked
about before but also a dual 120
millimeter fan mount with a removable
filtered mesh right there on the bottom
we find another removable fan fill take
this one for the power supply so you can
just pop that out the back if you want
to go ahead and clean it and then
finally on the back we find a 120 or 140
millimeter fan mount two expansion slots
and then a removable plate for the power
supply that allows you to take that out
and slide it back in now there are two
interior layouts for this case the one
we're going to be talking about mostly
in
this video is the mini ITX layout that
is the one that is based on the original
prodigy but we actually did a build
guide not that long ago in the m80 X
version of the Phenom so that will have
the same layout as an m-80 X version of
this case we'd have now before we move
to the inside of the case let's go ahead
and show you what's so special about
this little plastic book oh what did he
just do the little plastic strip has
what BitFenix is calling light track
technology and it's an unbroken line of
light that wraps around three sides of
the case it allows you to change the
colors completely anything from blue to
red to green and you can even add
pulsating effects to give it a bit of a
a breathing effect in the dark or if you
don't like any of that you can just turn
it off now because we have two of these
cases we were in a pretty unique
position where we can show you one that
has nothing installed in it and another
one that's been decked out and has a
pretty high-end gaming system installed
so first of all I take off the side
panel and this gives us some insight
into how that whole lighting effect
thing works the ones on the side panels
don't actually need to be plugged in
independently they just have like little
look looks like fiber-optic tubes that
are yeah not carrying the light around
the case and then delivering them here
you go to these pieces like this just
like that so the whole thing illuminates
very cool actually
then taking off both side panels we can
see that I actually removed the five and
a quarter inch expansion bay in order to
get an H 100 in there I also have
removed some of the three-and-a-half
inch expansion bays of which you can
normally have a maximum of five but in
this case we're down to two down here on
the bottom so there's an additional cage
that it can be installed this gave us
the ability to install a long graphics
card such as the Radeon HD 7970
that we have installed in here right now
so that's how we get that dual 120
millimeter rad in the front which means
we don't have to worry necessarily as
much about airflow in the case overall
because our CPU at least will be able to
exhaust its heat directly out without
affecting the rest of the interior
components although I do wish that the
side
panel where the graphics card is located
would have some perforations for airflow
to come in as well you can install up to
a 230 millimeter fan in the front
although the only ventilation holes in
the front are going to be about 140
millimeters you can install up to that
140 millimeter fan I talked about before
in the back it's got a two 'lest drive
mounting system go ahead and pop those
cages out install your drives into them
it's tooless for three and a half inch
so you just kind of flex them like this
and then put the drive in or it is
tooled for two and a half inch which is
what we were actually using for this
particular little rig it's also tooless
at the back for your PCI Express
expansion you go ahead and pop this guy
out pop this guy out there all thumb
screws go ahead put a graphics card in
and you're pretty much ready to rock and
then as I mentioned before if you want
to see a version of the N ATX system
that we did a very high-end air-cooled
configuration in you should definitely
check out that build guide and I've got
a bit of a teaser for this video for
those of you who stuck around till the
very end this mini ITX version with its
fewer pci expansion slots but improved
liquid cooling support and more overall
space inside compared to the m80 x1 once
you cram a larger motherboard in there
might be featured in an upcoming
water-cooled build guide for the
Colossus Mini ITX exciting anyway guys
thank you for checking out this video
like it if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment let me
know what you thought are you looking
forward to the water-cooled Colossus
Mini ITX build got you
I actually have something I can show you
guys that might get you a little bit
more amped up about it this box just
arrived from BitFenix the other day and
instead of doing my typical sort of you
know you could spin it a number of
different ways you could call it
flexible or you could call it lazy but
my typical you know approach of just
doing straight fittings ah yes I will be
using their blood-red fittings I'll be
using 45-degree angles and stuff like
that going for really nice clean tubing
runs this time around so it's going to
be a very different liquid cool build
guide from before so all the fittings
and right I think that's pretty much it
