Wemo which is not related to the wheat
at all it's spelled differently even and
the new way of the Wii U not me though
ok sorry this is actually really cool so
the whole like like wireless home
control thing like we've been talking
about this for years now you know you're
on your way home so you wanna like
pre-heat your oven so you you know turn
on your oven or whatever like like
Network controlled devices you know
we've got the Smart TVs now this is a
way of taking dumb devices or about
devices that don't have any built-in
logic and controlling them using your
iPhone so they're calling it the iPhone
home remote and you can set things up
evidently we're gonna be doing a full
NCIX tech tips about this so you know
States stay tuned right so it's great
for controlling things like your okay I
can't imagine why you'd need to control
like a like an iron your gonna iron
shirt you turn your iron on with them
with the remote okay whatever uh hair
curler are you okay heater there we go
heaters and fans this this I believe
because you know on those summer nights
you can't fall asleep first because it's
too hot and then because the fan is loud
so you can like tinker with it you know
from bed with your your iPhone remember
else you can set schedules just kind of
neat so you can do that with the
software as well with multiple vemos
switches you control as much or as
little of your home as you'd like we mow
runs on your iphone your Wi-Fi network
is all easy to set up and use so it
works on anything from an iPhone 3G I
believe up to yeah iPod Touch third
generation iPhone 3GS and later and any
iPad generation of products so let's go
ahead apparently I missed two of the
half a dozen or so stickers on the back
of the box here so we can go ahead and
check it out I'm not expecting to find
anything sort of revolutionary in terms
of the hardware in here but I'm really
excited to check out the software app so
there's your quick install guide plug
the thing in the thing download
install Wemo app from the app store
settings and so connect to your Wi-Fi
network select Wi-Fi connect to Remo
network launch through you know app to
complete with all ok so you'll be able
to complete the setup once you're in
there ok that's kind of cool so this is
fairly straightforward you've got a
three pronged plug although if you're in
a different territory it's likely that
the plug plug plug home the plug the
plug will look different you've got one
switch this is disappointing I would
have really liked to see two switches
with some kind of uh with with two like
to pass throughs with two full sets of
logic inside and one wireless chipset I
think that way we could have gotten more
functionality out of this device without
actually adding necessarily that much to
the hospital though what do I know about
what they cost there's a power button
here there's a wireless indicator
there's a restore button which using
doors only restore factory settings ah
okay so to restore factory settings for
whatever reason you wanted to do that I
don't know what else to say about this
so let's move on to the next one this is
the Wemo switch plus motion so not only
do you have this software wireless
switch this going on you've also got a
motion sensor so you can turn it on turn
it off and you can activate it with
motion and you can control all of that
seemed like I want my stuff to turn on
then off turn off or on only turn on /
off if motion so that's pretty neat just
kind of open this up and find out how
much different it is so it's basically
another one of these okay and then one
of these which is oh okay so this is two
completely separate like doodads no this
is this is similar
oh okay so once it okay so basically
once you synchronize and and get all of
your all of your Wemo devices set up
within the app you should be able to
kind of tinker around with it on a
pretty granular level so we're really
looking forward to checking this out
