that password ABCD or 69 all day are
really terrible passwords we know that
you shouldn't reuse passwords across
multiple sites we know that you
shouldn't write down your password yet
many people do these things every day
today we'll discuss the ramifications of
bad password habits and give you some
best practices to incorporate into your
personal security routine and on the
subject of privacy give the like button
a click if you'd like to see a video on
the best ways to hide your important
pictures and video that you like to look
at by yourself at night or with friends
I don't judge
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup click the link in the
video description to learn more so I
don't want to fear monger but I do want
to open with a few realistic scenarios
that could occur if your passwords were
broken into or leaked or whatever even
ignoring the obviously horrible stuff
like what if someone had access to your
online banking account strapped in it's
about to get a little freaky first off
Facebook or something like Facebook
maybe it doesn't seem like that big of a
deal sure I mean maybe they'll see that
you're the admin of the combined fan
groups of both narwhals and five-gallon
buckets but nothing could really go
wrong here right wrong not only can they
glean more information very easily like
your phone number but they can also
change your privacy settings opening up
your account to the world doesn't sound
that bad okay let's take it up a notch
the intruder could glean information
from your friends either by just having
closer access to their pages or by using
social engineering practices like simply
asking them things so effectively your
own failures can compromise the privacy
of your friends and family not cool and
that's ignoring that an especially
malicious attacker could ruin
friendships or people's perception of
you by posting things on your wall that
are highly inappropriate or asking
things of people that wouldn't be
appropriate so now let's do scenario
number two losing your email this is
actually one of the worst things that
can happen not because someone might
read the love letter you wrote in high
school but because your email is usually
used as a password and even username
recovery mechanism for your other
accounts poor email security is
basically like handing an intruder the
master key to your online identity which
brings into play
another aspect identity theft by having
access to a few of your accounts
especially your email it can actually be
pretty damn easy to steal someone else's
identity once that happens registering
new credit cards getting health care on
their dime or your dime or even
registering their bridge or highway
tolls under your name or their name is
relatively all easily possible so we all
agree that password security is
important and yes some things are
somewhat out of your hands like website
security and whatnot but what can you do
to help protect your own accounts well
you can protect against hacking attempts
with some fairly simple things never
store them in plain text on your
computers never write them down never
use your real name username birthday
phone number or any other easily
identifiable information in your
password
never use an easy keyboard combination
like ABCD QWERTY or qaz and there are
some other good tips to be careful with
the answers to security questions if you
don't feel like any of them are strong
enough you use an unrelated answer that
you know you can remember and if you
have to send your password to someone
for some probably terrible reason in
plain text online try splitting it up
across a few different mediums never
reuse a password but especially for your
email many people are guilty of reusing
passwords including myself in the past
but please at the very least use a
unique and strong password for your
email and finally use two-factor
authentication wherever possible you can
learn more about it here but basically
with two-factor authentication you can
have security codes sent to your mobile
device or email in order to double check
that it's actually you trying to log in
this can really help against things like
key loggers skimming your passwords as
these codes are one-time use I would
highly recommend two-factor
authentication
even if you ignore all of my other
suggestions that I've made please listen
to this one moving on now to create a
good password is actually rather simple
and if you'd like to see a great
infographic on it look up xkcd password
strength and that infographic it is
stated that and I quote through 20 years
of effort we've successfully trained
everyone to use passwords that are hard
for humans to remember but easy for
computers to guess end quote I
completely and wholeheartedly agree with
this stop using short but insanely
complicated passwords and start using
long and more simple ones that you can
actually remember this will help you to
not write them down or store them
somewhere and makes them actually a lot
harder to break a trick I use is
describing something in my environment
for instance this is a long skinny white
too but
happens to have tape on it so I could
make my password long skinny white tube
tape and it would actually be a pretty
secure as long as I don't break any of
the other rules as well but this really
isn't enough there's still a huge amount
of unique and long passwords to remember
so you might be inclined to tell your
browser to remember your password for a
certain website don't do that
Chrome's passwords are encrypted based
on your windows login password the
security of which is iffy at best
considering there's a few ways to
decipher them quite easily and Firefox's
passwords are normally very easily
accessible unless you set your own
master password which for whatever
reason it doesn't prompt you to do at
this time so how do you remember them
all well I'd recommend using a
third-party password manager for
cloud-based options you have LastPass
dashlane and one password amongst others
and for local storage options you have
key pass RoboForm
and password safe again amongst others
there are positives and negatives to
each of these solutions but that may be
for another video at another time a
different route than these would be if
you would like to use true key from
Intel a new password security system
based around using your fingerprint or
your facial recognition as encryption
utilities again there's positives and
negatives to that as well and the last
but not least option is a physical
security key like you Baqi from yubico
this is a token that's trusted by
everyone from Google to Facebook to the
frickin United States Department of
Defense and that can provide an
additional factor of authentication
against anything from your windows login
to your email to your password manager
itself so you'll never really have to
worry about some jackass intruders and
Netflix suggestions and ratings invading
your chill time next time you want to
log in mass drop has another one of
their pretty killer deals going on today
the LG 34 you see 87m dash B is

minimum which this monitors already at
you can check out this drop and many
others in link in the video description
which is dro PS / line is tech tips so
head over there now if you're interested
