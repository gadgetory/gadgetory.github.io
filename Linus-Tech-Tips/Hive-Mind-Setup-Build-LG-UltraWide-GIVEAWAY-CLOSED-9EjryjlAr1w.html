camera view haha you never know what
kinds of things are gonna go wrong when
you're doing it live like for example
starting a stream and then stopping it
almost immediately because you left the
cursor on the start streaming button and
you didn't realize that you accidentally
clicked the mouse again shortly
afterward so we are oh this is only the
second time we've ever done a live build
on - tech tips but we are definitely
getting our live shenanigans money's
worth out of them speaking of getting
your money's worth LG sponsored this
video they're having us build what
they're calling the hive mind PC so most
of the components in front of me were
actually selected by a group of our
viewers so they got to vote for what
they thought were the best choices so
we're gonna go through and show you guys
what exactly the community thought was a
good idea to put in our system so first
up we've got our case this is the ends
at X th 500 I Midtown there goes my
water bottle there we go then the
community didn't actually pick the power
supply I think we just advised LG and
won what we thought was a good power
supply because you don't want to end up
with the wrong power supply for a build
like something that doesn't have enough
power for everything or doesn't have the
right connectors or whatever so the
whole concept of having the community
choose the individual components won't
work if you end up with an incompatible
computer with that said the community
did go ahead and pick the core i7 8700 K
for us great choice six core processors
fastest thing on the planet right now
for gaming drives let's see we've got a
WD blue 500 gig MDOT two solid-state
drive for boot then we've got a Seagate
Barracuda that's a four terabyte
Barracuda Pro alright not bad
another thing the community voted on was
the graphics card and once
again the community is a good job
picking the most expensive thing
good job community can't go wrong when
you just pick the best graphics card for
like the amount of money that you have
to spend so we've got an msi armor gtx
ten atti we're gonna be equipping this
thing with I'm finding all of this out
for the first time by the way 16 gigs of
DDR for dual channel memory we're going
to be using an asus rog strict z 370 e
gaming motherboard and this was another
community vote we're gonna be cooling it
with the master liquid ml 240 our RGB so
for all the haters out there that are
like oh RGB sucks no one likes it the
truth of the matter is that people do
like it given the choice people will
take the RGB won over something else and
of course the centerpiece for the whole
thing is the lg ultra wide 38 wk 95 C so
this is a gigantic 38 inch ultrawide
monitor let's run through some of the
specs for this thing it's got a 21 by 9
aspect ratio so it's I got a higher
resolution than the ultra woods that
initially launched back when ultra-wide
was sort of first becoming a thing a
couple of years ago so it's like kind of
ultra wide 4 K so it's 38 40 by 1600
instead of 34 40 by 1440 it uses an IPS
panel it's curved and a monitor that
sits right on the desk in front of you
is one of the situations where a curved
display I personally find does feel
pretty nice it's got HDR 10 so it can
accept an HDR 10 input signal
it covers 99% of the sRGB color space
it's got USB type-c it's got a three
sided borderless design so super slim
bezels and of course it's whoop
got this okay it is large and in charge
let's go ahead and take these components
out of here maybe it will assemble this
first what do you think Brendon should
we should we assemble this first and
then we can we can put it aside while we
build the computer
all right yeah oh it's heavy okay okay
huh got this oh okay wait no I got it no
problem
no problem all right let's get that box
set it Oh laptop's about to go no no
laptop's not gonna fall back on the
table yes see we're not gonna have any
more difficulties stemming from you know
technical problems or me dropping
anything or anything like that for the
rest of this stream who's who's that at
the door
hubris why come on in hubris it's good
to see you old friend all right Oh see
this is the kind of stuff we normally
don't make you guys sit through but
honestly so many people loved the last
live build that we did that we thought
mean when LG came to us they were like
hey we want to do another one of these
live builders like such a shirt heck
yeah why not you guys are getting the
whole experience
nothing removed so if you guys wanted to
go out and build the exact machine that
we have you could literally throw this
video on in the background and sit there
and build it because we're gonna go
through absolutely everything even the
process for screwing in the base of the
monitor stand
bippity Boppity done so it's a metal
piece here and then a plastic piece here
interesting they're these accessories we
won't need until we hook up the computer
later so we're just gonna put these
somewhere where Brendan is unlikely to
trip over them we're gonna go ahead put
our stand there monitors have gotten a
lot easier to assemble over the years I
still remember when they didn't have
like self retaining screws with the
little wires on them and you had to kind
of put a bunch of screws into the base
and then you had to put a bunch of
screws between the base and the monitor
itself real hassle I
know how I'm gonna show you guys this
mounting process oh I know how I'm gonna
do it I'm gonna do it over here so
basically the way that it goes on you're
gonna want to get a side side boob angle
here here we go I'll line it from the
top end there you go there's your height
adjust there you go there's your tilt no
pivot and you just rotate the base I
guess or did I say pivot I meant swivel
all right so the monitor is in place
what else MSRP $14.99 oh and I'm
supposed to talk about the Tilton height
adjust but I already did that then
freakin tastic all right now let's build
a computer we can power this thing so
the idea was to have sort of a hybrid
workstation slash gaming machine and
that has become a surprisingly easy
thing to do now that intel has finally
beefed up the core counts on their
mainstream processors with the LGA 1150
whatever platform that isn't Ron now I
really wish they would 1151 so it went
11 56 1155 1150 1151 so there's no like
pattern that you can find to it so now
that they've got six cores available on
this platform it's really easy to build
something that's great for gaming but
can also handle like a render here and
there or some video editing on the side
if you need to do it so in terms of
stuff that we're gonna need to have the
motherboard box we're gonna grab our i/o
shield so we're gonna install that in
the case later we're gonna need a couple
of SATA cables one for our hard drive
and then one actually for a test SSD
that I'm gonna use because I think you
guys don't want to just sit here and
watch me install Windows for an hour
then other than that there's like some
temp probes and stuff but generally I
don't really bother with this kind of
stuff SLI bridge which I also generally
don't bother with anymore I mean ever
since that last season of scrapyard wars
like SLI SLI betrayed me
SLI let me down so I've been I've been
off the SLI bandwagon for a little while
Brandon you can take a short short rest
there if you want I'm gonna switch over
to the wide for just a couple couple
seconds here you want me to indicate to
you in some way when you're live okay so
why don't I just why don't I just do
this like right in front of you then you
can see is that helpful alright actually
I'll I lied I need to again anyway so
come over and have a look we're gonna do
our CPU installations so I always
recommend using the motherboard box as a
test bench but not necessarily using the
anti-static bag you might think if the
motherboard comes inside it then you
should put it on it but actually the
outside of some of these bags can have
conductive materials as part of what
makes them ESD safe and if there's for
whatever reason a charge and one of the
capacitors on the board and you bridge
those contacts you can actually cause a
short so not all ESD bags do I know I've
taken a lot of flack from people saying
well actually I'm actually Linus some of
them do I don't know if this one does so
if I was going to give you guys the
general rule that works for everything
that is put it on something definitely
non conductive which a cardboard box is
definitely non conductive it is amazing
to me how much time Intel seems to spend
re-engineering these cardboard holders
for their chips so now there's a little
pull tab here for your fingers or
whatever that's really horrible and how
bad it still it's so you pull this and
then this comes out or whatever thank
you I thought it was I thought it was
this one that was supposed to come out I
would have actually worked a little
better for me all right do you guys want
me to put the sticker on I'm not
actually monitoring the chat right now
my computer's over there but let me know
in the chat and maybe someone will
someone will let me know what you guys
think I think Nick's having a look at
the chat over there so he can he can
tell me if you guys want me to put like
case badge stickers on and stuff I
remember that's the kind of thing I used
to get really excited about when I was
younger and I hadn't done as many PC
builds I'd be like yeah I'm gonna get
these stickers so perfectly aligned like
you're not even gonna believe it wasn't
put on by a machine
all right so CPU installation pretty
simple you just lift up the arm here
come on in nice and close Brandon how
close can you get you get a little
closer can you get closer can you get
closer come on come be my friend okay so
we pull out the arm lift it up then what
we're gonna do is we're gonna take the
CPU here we're gonna find the corner
with the little triangle so there it is
right there pull that out like that then
we're going to be mad at ourselves for
not checking the triangle corner before
we lifted this there it is sometimes
it's indicated by a little dot but now
I've seen dots that aren't on the same
corner as the triangle so it's always
good to make sure you find the triangle
drop it into the socket no force
required give it a little wiggle make
sure it's actually in there then you
pull this down put that arm down and it
pops off just like that
okay protip you guys never ever throw
this away because if for whatever reason
you have to RMA your motherboard down
the road or whatever the case may be you
have to use this to protect the pins in
transport so what I usually do is I go
well I'm unlikely to need this unless I
also need this so I put it in there then
I take that whole thing and put it into
the motherboard box for safekeeping
it's actually really important as you go
to stay organized with all the parts
that you have otherwise you finish your
build and at the end of it you've got
like this giant mess to clean up instead
of sitting and playing your games which
is what you actually want to do at that
point so I'm gonna go ahead and throw
this core i7 box back together if I can
I think a stupid plastic holder dang it
hold on a second
none of this is helping my reputation
for dropping things I don't think
honestly I don't drop that much stuff
it's just it's just a misconception all
right I like to build out a lot of the
motherboard before I even open up the
case so the next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna go ahead and install our RAM
so we've got is this uh oh it stridency
oh I thought it was RGB Ram looks like
looks like the community wants an RGB
cooler but they draw the line at RGB Ram
how interesting can I can I can never
tell you know you know what's what is
the step too far
you know RGB fan yes RGB system
component
no okay I think this Rick's board is
fairly RG beat up too though so Ram
installation pretty simple this is just
an old habit you don't actually have to
do the sockets that are further away
from or the RAM slots that are further
away from the CPU socket but what is
still nice about this approach so it
used to be that those were the primaries
and you couldn't populate the
secondaries first I was a long time ago
though the reason I still do it though
is because it does give if you don't
have all four slots populated it does
give the CPU a little bit more breathing
room if you're using an air cooling or
like honestly just in general so you've
got that extra extra little bit of space
where you know if you had a large heat
pipe cooler or whatever the case may be
you wouldn't have to worry about any
kind of clearance issues especially if
you have tall ramp like you look at the
height of the PCB there and then you
look at the height of the cooler there's
actually quite a difference so this this
is what I would consider to be fairly
tall Ram all right now we're gonna set
that aside and let's get this case
opened up I have never actually built in
this one so this will be a new
experience for me
and hopefully I can do a reasonably good
job of cable managing it for you guys
but I'm not gonna make any promises here
let's go ahead and continue to practice
what we preach so putting all the
packaging for our ram together and then
we'll just kind of dump that
it's uh you know what why don't we want
me like collect our trophies back here
or something there we go okay I didn't
grab a knife so that's okay a new key
will do in a pinch this thing tempered
glass oh yeah wow this case even gets a
special sticker from Canada Post saying
that is it is heavy / Lord which is
heavy in French so it's over twenty two
point seven kilos that's over fifty
pounds even though really no that can't
be right why does this say heavy is this
thing even tempered glass I was like wow
50 pounds of tempered glass is a lot
maybe this is just Canada Post going a
little bit on the on the drunken side
here because that does not seem right it
does have it does have tempered glass in
it but there's there's no way this is
fifty pounds up that's ridiculous all
right
box on box ah haha ouch hate that still
haven't figured out a way to avoid
getting zapped every time I take a case
out of the box cuz the styrene and the
plastics that they use to wrap these
things they just are like magnets for
static electricity alright so I'm gonna
switch back over to you Brandon and
let's have a look at this thing I've
never actually seen this case even
pretty simple pretty clean so standard
ATX we can go ahead and pop our panel
off make sure that we don't whoa this is
new I have never seen a kit wait what
hold on a second so the panel comes off
like that looks like there's just one
screw here for it instead of having two
even though there's two on the other
side and then there's this there's this
little ear here that oh okay there we go
oh just pops off like that Oh
interesting so you just slide the
tempered-glass into this bottom kind of
there's a little there's a couple little
plastic like nubbins down there and then
you just pop these these like friction
mounts up here in and then you can screw
it in at the top Oh interesting I'm
actually kind of surprised that that
keeps it safe during shipping but you
can see they've taken some extra
precautions here so they've got these
plastic or no it looks like these are
metal yeah they've got a metal bracket
up here and then at the bottom there's
these the two pieces that hold it in
place you can actually see where they go
the plastic that protects the glass here
is has got dents in it those are made of
plastic so that it's I guess mounted on
all sides by except this one my softer
components interesting sure I actually
don't know what exactly a super chat is
just when I went in the live dashboard
it was like oh you should turn this on
and I was like okay so over on this
panel we've got Oh interesting that's
actually one thing NZXT does really well
is spending money even on their budget
cases in ways that are meaningful so
check this out they've gone and they've
put a regrettably not like easily
cleanable as far as I can tell I mean
how does this pop-out so here's like a
bracket yeah it's not it's not that easy
to pop out but they've gone and they've
put a filter on this front air intake
that's over here by the kind of where
the the drives would go in a more
traditional chassis but where you'll
probably end up installing a radiator in
something like this so that even though
you've got a solid front panel here on
at least this side you're able to get a
decent amount of airflow and it's
filtered as we saw in our one year
airflow
experiment filters definitely work if
there was any doubt in your mind that a
mesh filter on air will you know draw
some of the dust particles out of it you
can put that to rest once and for all
I sure Nick do you want to tell me oh
we're laser etching the back panel oh
that's right
I forgot to mention that so in addition
to the community choosing the components
for the build they also provided some
ideas for how we could pizzazz it up a
little bit so I think we're putting like
our laser etching like a sandal or
something on here look you know what
we'll get to the customizations later
let's let's go ahead and get the rig
built right now strat our Scrat are 20
bucks to say sup Scrat are should change
his or her name to like mad ballin are
that's crazy scratch our it kind of
sounds like like kind of a I don't know
like kind of sounds like a rash that
you'd kind of get on your groin you know
like I've got a mad you know I've got
some mad Scrat are going on down there
like I'm gonna leave I'm gonna leave my
boxers on in the change room I don't
want anyone seeing that scratch are like
Spice family you know fun fact I've
actually my my my go to playlist right
now stop radio now part of the reason I
like it is that whenever I start it I
have to play stuff like google music is
like play stop radio I'm like haha
that's funny those of you who don't know
stop is a Spice Girls song from like way
back in the late 90s holy crap
was it the late 90s dad
anyway so part of it is that and part of
it is I'm like yeah I love this music I
have I have terrible terrible taste
music it's got like some S Club 7 in
there it's got some newer stuff got some
other Spice Girls Robin says loving the
vids lately what's the implication here
Robin but you didn't love the vids
before that something about no no that's
not nice that's like you know like
imagine if I said this I matter so I was
like you know Brandon that last video
are you shot it was really good
what's the implication then Brandon like
all the rest of the work that you did
for the last five and a half years you
know what pretty subpart pretty subpart
that last one that was good really I
didn't know super chat was like a big
thing I I don't think we were eligible
for it before and a lot of people a lot
of people if you follow on Twitter
you'll probably know this but our
live-streaming was actually turned off
outright by YouTube due to a a small
disagreement that we had well actually
you don't disagree with YouTube YouTube
just disagrees with you so YouTube had a
small disagreement with the way that we
were using the YouTube platform to
promote live streams on Twitch so you're
technically not allowed to just make a
video upload it to YouTube and say hey
hey guys we're streaming live somewhere
else
and we actually didn't even know that
because even though it's in the you know
YouTube Terms of Service which we have
read it's never been an issue because
we've been doing that for years and we
had no idea that was bad because we've
been they've never cared before and
we've actually been doing it since
before YouTube would have really had a
good reason for caring about twitch
because they didn't have a competitor
back when we first started the land show
it must have been like
Oh Raoul um I'm gonna be doing that here
come on in close so people can see how
to install the power supply so I'm I'm
oh ok hi Cooper
oh yeah floatplane does accept credit
card with that said the payment system
is a little borked right now we're
expecting it to be fixed in the next two
weeks
yeah I'm refering to the Spice Girls
song someone bought a super chat just to
dis my taste in music thanks Joel Joel
knows what's up we've got some rig but
what there's so many of these I mean
we're gonna have to yeah ok so we're
gonna throw a link in the video
description once this goes to vaad we
had someone send a super chat letting us
know that they wanted to replicate this
build because they've got about this
much money to spend and actually yeah
there's nothing in here that I'm the
community actually did a surprisingly
good job like there's nothing in the
here that I'm looking at going wow you
guys really screwed the dog on this one
this is that this is a bad choice so if
you guys wanted to go and build this
exact machine I would I would I would
stand behind it I there was one super
chat that I had wanted to answer so
there we've got our four power supply
screws and I will get to it in a second
here I've gone with a bottom facing fan
so this is always something you have to
think about your particular situation
for because most cases have the mounting
for both orientations you can see
there's a lip here there's one here
there's one here and there's one here so
I could have flipped this power supply
around if I wanted to but I opted to go
this way because this case has really
nice big feet on it so even if it's
sitting on
carpet you should still have adequate
clearance for the power supply to dryer
and from the bottom and it's got a nice
easily removable filter that's not super
long so it's it's pretty simple to get
at so when you can get away with it it's
a little nicer to orient it this way all
right so right I had wanted to get to
when am I doing the seven users one CPU
ultimate virtualized workstation so
that's gonna be as soon as I can
it's something that I am sort of already
working on behind the scenes I've gotten
a couple of VMs up I just got my PCI
Express extension cables in so that'll
help me get that going because I'll be
able to throw all six of the graphics
cards that I want in there but there's
no real hurry for it and it's gonna be a
very time-consuming build so I want to
take my time I want to make sure I'm
doing it right I'm still waiting for
some octane drives from Intel and I'm
holding off on requesting them you know
just in case they release a new one with
higher capacity or whatever in the
meantime while I'm waiting that's also
why I've held off on requesting graphics
cards just in case something were to
drop before I finish this project like I
think it's gonna be a few months before
we actually release that video I want to
make sure that we are running the
absolute latest and greatest in that
thing I mean there's nothing worse than
building what will probably be in the
neighborhood of a forty to fifty
thousand dollar machine and having it be
obsolete by the time you actually load
an OS on it like I I hate that that
sucks that's the worst when you get the
timing wrong and you just feel like a
total Butthead so I'm gonna try and I'm
gonna try my best to avoid that yes soon
so the cables I'm pulling out right now
I've got my 24 pin connected already I'm
grabbing my four plus four CPU connector
so we are definitely going to need that
I'm grabbing a SATA connector and then
the last one that I grabbed already is
one of these puppies so an eight pin to
do late pin PCI Express connector those
I think all the power cables we're gonna
need but I don't know if this needs a
molex connector or something like that
I'll grab that out of the power supply
box later all right go ahead and hit me
with the super chasse Ian gave $50 oh
well thank you Ian appreciate that here
do you want to just can you can you fire
up the super chats on here and then I
can read them myself yeah I just I can't
look at that right now all right so
let's let's go ahead and get this i/o
shield in here so one trick that's
really important is bending back these
contacts there you don't wanna bend them
back too much because these actually
serve a purpose they're supposed to make
contact with the outer metal housings on
the connectors here I think it's like a
grounding thing or something can't
remember anyway the point is you still
want them to make contact but if you
don't bend them back a little from my
experience you'll often end up
especially with things like HDMI and USB
you'll end up with the the metal things
sticking into the port and then you
won't be able to put something in it
like see see that see how you could
accidentally have those tabs sticking in
the port and you can actually short or
even fry a port like that if you're not
careful so we're just gonna give them a
little Bend then we're gonna go ahead
and pop this baby in here this is
actually one really nice benefit to
higher-end motherboards that's like a
stupid thing and you shouldn't really
have to pay more for it but they come
with nicer i/o shields nicer cases nicer
motherboards the i/o shield installation
process does tend to be a little bit
easier you know you get but you gotta
save I mean when people when people want
to save you know $3.00 from one bottle
of motherboard to another and that's how
compressed the product stacks are in a
lot of cases for things like
motherboards you gotta you gotta save
two pennies somewhere alright so now I
think wow
is flowing really smoothly building a PC
really has gotten a lot easier over the
years so what I usually like to do is I
hold by the PCI Express slot and buy a
power slot or a power connector or RAM
in a pinch or a heatsink up here
actually you know what I'm going to go
with the power the 24 pin power and I'm
gonna go with this heat sink right here
for this board it varies from board to
board and then we want to double check
make sure everything is aligned back
here we're not yep
see it happened I knew it the HDMI the
HDMI one is not bent enough so it was
jamming in there 26,000 people are
watching this yeah really
that's more live viewers than we've ever
had buy it
oh we had 42 on the we broke up stream
that's oh oh six million oh okay okay
okay she's hi everybody now I got all
this pressure I would have rather not
know her that many people like it's a
funny thing because you you sort of you
sort of assume that you know someone who
performs on camera all the time is just
you know comfortable on camera and it's
you know it's whatever it's just routine
and there are certain aspects of my job
that are by the way there's one little
trick that I that I used here already
NZXT does a really great job of this so
they've got a nice little nubbin on the
middle motherboard connector so that you
can slide the motherboard into place and
then just pop it on there and that'll
hold it still while you're plugging in
all your other stuff that is one of the
most common ways that people will brick
a motherboard when they're building a
computer they'll be holding trying to
hold it in place and they'll be like so
focused on putting in this screw that
they don't realize that the rest of the
motherboard is pivoting around it and
scratching up the back of the PCB it's a
really easy way to accidentally break a
trace so we've got that popped into
place it's a really really nice feature
of their cases there's other
manufacturers that do it as well I'm
gonna go ahead and grab what I think are
the motherboard screws I actually
grabbed them before and then I went and
I put them somewhere and I don't
remember
put them see now I've got now I got all
this pressure huh
right here it is okay give me one give
me one second here right right so people
may can I just how do I do it really are
you gonna throw right there I can read
their two hands okay okay what was the
thing that I was gonna tell people
though oh right right right the
uncomfortable part okay I'll remember
that okay so go ahead hit me hit me with
some super chats
oh so it's um google play music has a
feature where you can just play a song
and then you can start up a radio
station of songs that other people who
like that song also like it's one of my
favorite features actually because like
I I like a lot of crappy late 90s early
2000s music so if I just grab any song
from that era then it'll just start to
feed me other crappy music and it makes
my Saturday thanks Scott okay hold on
who was that okay Tim alright Tim let me
have a little super chat with you I
actually break surprisingly little hard
to do you guys see how careful I'm being
right here like I've got my I've got
this magnetic screwdriver that I
borrowed from Jake because I left mine
at home I've got okay I kind of damned
that into the motherboard there I've got
this
ergonomic I've got this ergonomic desk
that I am working sitting on top of it
no but in all seriousness I actually
break surprisingly little hardware it's
kind of a funny thing about computer
hardware
is because it's expensive we treat it
like it's made of glass like it's crazy
scary fragile it went off for a second
are we back you're back poof
so because it's really expensive we
treat it like it's super crazy fragile
and it is it is but really experienced
text you guys are gonna see this in the
upcoming iMac pro repair vlog with Lois
Rossman tend to have enough experience
to have lived through doing stuff that
they probably shouldn't have done and no
one would including them would ever
recommend that you do and having the
hardware be just fine
like I remember going into a computer
shop one time when I was young and
impressionable and they just had like a
Rubbermaid bin full of graphics cards no
est bags no no like protective sleeves
no styrofoam slots for them like pretty
good compared to these guys
they were all older things like they
were basically worthless but it was an
entire bin of graphics cards just just
piled in there and they like fish
through them and get them they pullin
out and they pulled one out and and I
think it worked and I was like my mind
was blown I was like there's there's
there's no way that should work but
they're not actually that fragile in a
lot of cases which is not to say that
you should not be careful it's just that
when I drop something and now hard
drives would be an exception
I would never drop a hard drive but if I
were to you know drop something like an
SSD because I'm being blase or whatever
it's fine I have literally shot hoops
with an SSD before that was back the
back the first time that I visited
Intel's Folsom campus just for like a
silly vlog style video so you can see in
spite of my rambling we are actually
making excellent progress here we've got
our CPU and RAM installed we've got our
motherboard mounted in the case there's
if you want to do like a quick sanity
check on your motherboard
most of them use nine mountings
so you got one two three and they're
mostly in a row one two three one two
three this one uses eight because it's
got that nubbin in the middle that
doesn't actually have a place to screw
it in but honestly that's plenty your
motherboards not going anywhere I've
used as few as like three when I'm in a
hurry so yeah all right do you want to
hit me with some super chats okay do you
want to stand close so that at least the
mic can or do you want to just hold it
so that I can see it so I can read them
I like to read things okay thank you
well that's fantastic because I would
have hated it if our videos inspired you
to build your worst gaming PC you know
that's actually a marketing thing that I
always get a kick out of like oh man
like you know when in video we'll
release a new graphics card and they're
like it's our best GPU ever and I'm like
wow really so you're now hold on just a
minute here you're telling me that you
guys built it better this time than last
time you didn't build something worse
yeah
well golly oh what's going what's going
on over here what is what's this we've
got a whole gear here listen what's
what's going on what's going we've got a
whole committee Oh is it done wow that
looks fantastic so we're doing this to
the window look at that dang the hive
mind so is this a piece of tempered
glass that we etched listen to you Dan
you know someone actually messaged me on
the forum the other day asking if I
would recommend this laser engraver or
this laser cutter would we recommend it
wait we've got a little bit of burn mark
you know that comes right off
oh say that is so clean do you guys want
the real one then okay the real one's
smaller and it's not it's not tinted so
might you might get a bit of a different
effect to it but yeah just make sure you
peel off that plastic which you knew but
anyway man does that not look freaking
awesome here let me just make sure I'm
not catching the light here so you got
the Linus cat
face mean face thing up there and then
here we go hive mind down here looks
great great job you guys
freakin awesome no I'm not gonna drop it
I don't actually drop things okay
random come on in close while I
installed the m-dot to drive and then
Nick can Nick can can you just point it
at me so I can read them I can I can do
that oh no no this is not my screwdriver
you can actually see that this is jacooz
screwdriver and I actually really I hate
the way that he set it up with the tape
on the bottom there because so mine is a
snap-on and then this is like their like
budget brand but like it's basically the
same thing so it's a Williams it's the
same screwdriver pretty much except it
doesn't have a knurled finish here and
that's the one that I actually like to
use when I want grip like this gives you
a little more torque which is nice but
when you're trying to go fast it's
actually nice to have the thinner shaft
when you're kind of screwing things in
quickly to like a drive or something
that doesn't require a lot of force
screwdriver
musashi miyamoto super chatted eighteen
point nine nine of whatever PLN's are
what currency is that PLN do you know
Brandon you have any idea okay yeah well
we got nothing so I have I have no idea
if that's like an impressively large
super chat or if it's like really small
Poland low tea slow tea slow tea ones
low tea is 36 cents so that's about five
bucks then okay all right I want to say
that I like LMG cooler okay I'm gonna
assume that means that you think LMG is
cool and that I'm cool I'm can I go with
that
I'm going with that I'm going with that
what else we got where's the Yoko body
pillow ah yes we do have the Yoko body
pillow we still have it
no you do not need to go get it right
now we've though the Yoko body-pillow
has made plenty of appearances in our
videos that thing has turned into like
such a meme it's in the bedroom that's
the answer I mean come on what else were
you expecting okay so for those of you
actually watching for the build the
parts that I took out of the motherboard
box here yeah my experience in the past
anyway
typically motherboards have these
pre-installed but it looks like they're
not doing that anymore
so there's a little standoff and then a
little tiny screw get you guys a nice
good look at that
that's for installing your MDOT to drive
and I guess the reason they don't pre
install them anymore
would be because it might you might have
to put it into a different spot and that
might have been confusing for users but
I actually I kind of disagree with that
approach because most MDOT two drives at
least on the desktop are the 2280 format
so they're eight centimeters long and if
they were to pre install it at the eight
centimeter mark like most companies have
in the past I think that's actually a
better user experience just having this
pre-installed and then undoing the screw
but then I can also see how removing
this this this nut could be confusing
because when you take out the screw
initially it's not obvious that you can
move it if you if you've never installed
an MDOT to drive before so well dang it
there you go
these are non-ferrous so I can't pick
them up with the magnetic screwdriver
sorry super chats I will get to you in a
moment here I just need to go ahead and
get this screwed in and I need my focus
for that all right here we go so there
you go so that's the nut then you go
ahead and you just pop this in from the
top kind of like I'm like a laptop
memory slot then you see how it kind of
sticks up like that that's intentional
then you just need a smaller screwdriver
put the screw on there line that up and
bippity Boppity screw it in
Bobby mark says hi Linus hi Bobby
Time Lord says what's the most expensive
thing you've ever dropped up and asked
that a lot and for some reason
I can never remember them we can answer
man I mean it was it was kind of me like
I definitely contributed at least 50% of
the blame when max dropped that test
bench like we didn't that wasn't really
clear from the video but that was
definitely a thing that was pretty
expensive because it was an entire built
computer with like high end graphics
card brand-new unreleased processor is
hard to a sign of value to something
that's not even released yet I just
realized I got ahead of myself and I
installed the 24 pin power connector
without you guys sorry I just I get into
like PC building mode and spitting all
over the computer and then I'm just like
plugging things in so here we go I'm
gonna plug in the 24 pin oh this is a
nice little cable management thing that
ends that XT does so that allows you to
hide your 24 it's keyed so it can only
go in one way to go ahead and it's
usually got the key towards the outer
edge of the board so you would install
it this way and boom that goes on a
little something like that and kind of
tie you up we're gonna we're gonna fix
up fix it up a little bit more later the
way that I tend to do my cable
management is in Reverse in most cases
so that's why I didn't plug any of my
modular cables into the motherboard
I just find when I don't have a bunch of
tension on the cable from the back it's
a little bit easier especially on ones
like the eight pin CPU connector here so
I'm gonna go ahead and plug that bad boy
in this one's always a little tricky I
personally prefer power supplies where
they have a little plastic bridge
between them that locks those two four
pins together but see sonic didn't do
that on this model for whatever reason
thank you see sonic that's fine I got
this so then what I like to do is pull
them back through and then that way I
just I find it's a little bit easier to
manage there you go nice and clean all
right
what else we got yeah cheap i/o shields
are literally knives says Sheldon for
five bucks
uh-huh yeah pretty much why did I use a
key for opening up the monitor I should
have just grabbed the i/o shield I mean
we also have a good i/o shield
that's one reason why we couldn't done
that something else sends that ecstasy
typically does pretty well but they
actually didn't do a great job of on
this case is lots of little cable
management loops on the back they've got
a few down this side they've got a few
down this side but what these will allow
us to do is go ahead and oh actually oh
no I see I missed one here oh maybe it's
better than I thought so this will allow
us to route this 8 pin connector
wherever it is that we want to go so
we're gonna go ahead and you know we're
gonna write down this side so this is a
this is a total cheapskate move so most
people will use zip ties and they're
typically included with your power
supply in case to secure cables at the
back but a lot of cases come with these
these twist ties already waste not want
not right so I take out the twist tie
and put that back in who says you can't
use a twist tie for cable management see
that that's right I just saved a
fraction of a penny right there you guys
thought it happened live fraction of a
penny boom just like that ah all right
super chance when's the last time you
used a molex cable oh it actually comes
up all the time like there's still like
if you still run a sound card there's
sound cards that take molex cables
there's like fan controllers that take
molex cables there's advantages a molex
like this say that connector is really
fragile it's easy to snap off so it's
not like it's perfect you know what I
want to do real quick here is get this
Wow get this cooler in because I'm a
little bit worried about how the cable
management is gonna work for it
things with RGB fans pumps I mean that's
that's already a lot of things to plug
in they tend to have a lot of wires and
since they're all around the CPU socket
area if you don't do a good job of
planning exactly where you're gonna put
them then you'll end up with a really
messy rat's nest and it's right in what
would normally be kind of like the
centerpiece area of your system so I
want to make sure that we're we're
planning this out accordingly so here's
our here's our RGB
CPU blocks blast pump combo unit here
we've got so actually wow these are some
pretty nice flexible tubes on here
that's not bad they're using these
rotary fittings here so that's that
should give us some options and then
we've got a couple of connectors here
we've got an RGB lead that's actually
long enough that we should be able to
get it behind the motherboard so that's
good and then we've got a simple three
pin power that's actually well it's
really fine gauge wiring I guess this
must be a pretty low power pump so we're
gonna run that to the CPU fan header on
the motherboard so that's that's that's
fine so far then we've got our fans so
it looks like Coolermaster hasn't gone
the route of including like RGB passed
through through there block like a
little more complicated circuitry in the
block / pump for the fans so we're gonna
have to find our own RGB ports for the
fans maybe there's a maybe there's more
wiring in here Oh see this is what I'm
talking about so in addition to the NZXT
control hub for case fan and RGB
lighting a little push there we've got
an additional control hub that'll do
what's this are these magnetic no how
does this oh wow you have to put in all
the little pins yourself or you serious
oh boy oh boy
this is what I was afraid of holy smokes
look at the sheer amount of wiring this
thing comes with this is exactly what I
was afraid of this build just got like
20 minutes longer so I apologize in
advance to everyone who's sort of you
know waiting with bated breath
for like the moment when we plug in the
GPU but that is not happening for a
while
twenty-seven thousand people are still
watching they're gonna watch me struggle
with this thing for a little bit here
because this is some pretty some pretty
bad news bears yeah we can we can switch
to the wide for a little bit of
Brendan's tired just just I don't know I
don't even know where the keyboard went
I lost it I lost the keyboard where is
it
okay so I'll talk to you guys over here
for a while Brandon do you just want to
man focus on that or something or you
could even just throw it on sticks above
me here actually that would probably be
better if you just want to throw an
angle down here because there is so much
freaking stuff here I can't even figure
out how the mounting works for the CPU
out of like in in less than 30 seconds
here which is how long I would expect a
really good mount to take me okay so
this we don't let's start by getting rid
of stuff we don't need so this right
here is LGA 2011 hardware don't need
that almost everything else in here is
not labeled which is frustrating but I
suspect this is AMD man man you guys
know I think this one's Intel so this
looks like this looks like an Intel
bracket kind of akin to the the nock to
a style one okay presumably we will need
yeah okay this is it this is AMD there
you go you can tell because it's got the
little little hooks here that that's a
mounting mechanism that I'm not a huge
fan of I wish AMD had never done that
okay then we've got four screws for
these and we can put away these AMD side
brackets we don't need those anymore
okay
process of elimination no no I can I can
read them I'll tell you what I want what
I really really want you know of I
really really want - to build this PC
Thanks minna minna doe appreciate that
appreciate that although I don't know if
wannabe is really my favorite of theirs
I've known Y wannabes awesome uh what
way is this gonna go in I'm not sure if
it matters actually ok so we'll pop that
in there and then it looks like it's got
cleanings for the screws to go in yet
there we go alright that's pretty good
ryan says can you turn the ISO up it's a
little bit dark Oh perfect thanks Ryan
I can't believe that you paid us to help
us improve our production values you're
you're a kind you're a kind person Ryan
appreciate that what do we got here oh
wow I just I oh crap I just scrolled
through like literally all of them I
yeah can you find where we left off cuz
that's that's all I need to know if you
just want to find where we left off I
just accidentally scrolled like to the
bottom no no no we'll do our best we'll
do our best go back to where we left off
I don't want to I don't want to skip
people if I have to just if I have to
just talk to super chat people at the
end I will do that actually I probably
shouldn't necessarily commit that cuz I
don't know how many there are there's a
lot okay we'll do our best
how about I commit to doing my best
that's like the ultimate non-committal
commitment you know what I'm gonna do my
best for you but I will okay so some
assembly required on this CPU cooler so
what I've done so far here is attached
the LGA 1150 we down to 775 bracket to
the pump
/ block component all right now I'm
gonna need I'm going to need the
instructions I am actually going to need
the instructions this is not good
because I've got to
Baggies here of long screws one with
square ends and then one with thumb
screw ends oh you know what the thumbs
go around one that's probably Radiator I
think we're actually in pretty good
shape here okay cool so this must be for
the CPU socket itself so we've got a
backplate which this was one of the
biggest innovations I think in case
design over the last like ten years was
the idea of cutting out the area behind
the CPU socket so that you can install
coolers with back plates without ripping
the whole motherboard out really really
nice feature so we've got one of those
and then we've also got oh my goodness a
whole bunch of crap then we've got these
little kind of screws here so these
stick through okay that's good that
didn't get lost
so these stick through here and then
you've got these little retention pieces
that stick on to the end so that they
don't pop off then you can you can slide
them back and forth to the position that
you want some some assembly required all
right okay let's do some super Chad's
here toasted vivid says hey just want to
say love your vids wondering why you
like socks and sandals so much because
they're the best do I need another
reason to like socks and sandals no so
much no in all seriousness though my
feet get too hot and then they smell if
I if I don't have adequate ventilation I
mean it's just like you know it's like
why do you like having a case with
cooling fans in it so much because you
got to have that cooling it's important
all right got this assembled Adam Jones
says what are you gonna do if it doesn't
post ah not an option we're gonna we're
gonna we're going to make sure this
computer boots I mean we'll do the usual
troubleshooting steps well you know try
and figure out why exactly it is that
it's not posting we'll start swapping
components if it comes to that I'm
really not expecting any problems I mean
pretty much everything we've got you not
pretty much everything we've got here is
reputable reliable stuff alright so
we've got our back
played on there we haven't used any
adhesive strips or anything I'm not a
fan I don't think this one even comes
with any but I'm not a fan of using
those anyway just because then if you
need to rip it off then it's sort of a
hassle we've got these spacers those are
gonna go on the other side of the board
when we actually install the block you
know what none I'm gonna throw them on
now ah no I'm not gonna throw them on
now
I actually mmm I actually don't know if
we need those oh that's interesting then
we've got these thumb screws they might
go they might go on top hmm nope yeah
those spacers do look like they go on
okay I'm gonna put those here for now
along with all of these thumb screws
we'll keep those safe now I'm gonna
figure out this wiring situation I I am
not honestly a huge fan of what's going
on here right now so oh wow look at this
so I understand wanting to give the user
options but Coolermaster has gone and
they've they've included an internal USB
connector here to an external adapter
then the cable that actually plugs into
the block presumably is that where it
goes
no it plugs into the controller hub so
then the cable that goes into the hub
which is a micro be my favorite
connector of course is like an external
cable and then the whole thing is like
this long like look at this that right
there is the stuff that cable management
nightmares are made of I'm not a huge
fan of this kind of approach we're gonna
have to find somewhere to put this we
might end up stashing it down here in
the drive bays or something like that
I'm still figuring out my options then
we've got these little extensions and
these are for the RGB connectors that
are on the fans presumably so you can
see these guys
man okay so these guys go like this
there we go
these are nice these are these are keyed
so you can't put them in that wait what
oh okay yeah these are keyed so you
can't do them the wrong way so that's
good I guess but then they've got one
that's got four wires I guess that's for
the one on the CPU block itself did I
drop one holy bananas the number of
wires this thing comes with and maybe
you don't even need those are those just
extensions okay so then you've got this
like three piece harness Ritu one
harness here that goes from oh boy oh
boy you guys and then they've got these
little these little adapter doodads if
you don't want to use extensions these
little can you even see those they're
little like pin to pin connectors are
really hard to make out alright so the
fans are gonna be easy as far as I know
this motherboard has two CPU fan headers
one for the pump and then one for the
fans themselves so we're gonna go ahead
we're gonna plug these fans into this Y
adapter so what these do is they allow
both of the fans to be controlled a
court and then you just read the RPM or
the no the 11 I believe it's only one of
them has a PWM wire no only one of them
has an RPM sense so they can both be PWM
controlled and then you just read the
rpm off this green wire on one of them
so that way you can tell that they're
both the same model so they're probably
both spinning at about the same speed so
we've got that done now
oh these seem to go into this and this
and then the block has an RGB lead that
seems to go into this so the block and
both fans all go into this one connector
assuming that you want them all
incra NIH's then this goes into our
control hub presumably and you can
either do that through an extension
cable like this one that you then put
one of these little male to male adapter
pin doodads in so here so you would you
would go ahead you would put that thing
in there and then you would put that
thing in there or if you're close enough
you could just leave the adapter pin in
here and you could plug directly into
the controller hub so you have many many
options for how you want to plug this in
which is both a blessing and a curse
we're gonna plug everything into a one
here I guess holy crap
oh I'm getting stressed out here alright
this is kind of neat this hub has
apparently temperature fan sensors case
reset and motherboard reset maybe that's
four I'm actually not a hundred percent
sure like can you hook your like actual
motherboard switches up to it or
something holy bananas so this right
here is a four pin two four pin
extension that has a green and the black
wire running off of it that I guess here
we go yeah is a fan rpm sense of some
sort I don't understand why would need
this why am I not using my motherboard
to monitor this stuff I am gonna use my
motherboard to monitor this stuff I
don't want this okay so let's put that
away we'll put that in our pile of
cables that the winner of this machine
is gonna get in a gigantic bag because
there's so many pieces that I don't need
here alright then we've got whatever the
crap this is this looks like it goes to
a thermal probe or something and then
yes it does come with an included
extension to your reset
switch so maybe there's like a feature
where you can go online and use the
cloud to reset your computer if you're
not there or something like I could see
that being useful for something like
crypto mining for example but I don't
think a typical desktop is gonna benefit
much from that so we're gonna go ahead
we're gonna put that away as well okay
so the nightmare mess of cables seems to
have been mostly reduced down to this
hub this USB connector to control the
hub this harness of RGB wiring that will
go to the hub and then these optional
extensions that we might need later but
I'm gonna talk over here for now when
did life become so complicated like when
did this happen and what is that piece
that just dropped I'm gonna need that
let's put that back up there 20 bucks to
not drop the computer I know not to drop
the computer right I'm supposed to let's
see
Mazda fan gaming says SSDs are safe to
around 50 G's yeah the SSDs are pretty
difficult to damage by shock like you
would actually have to like baseball-bat
them to reliably destroy them just by
like hitting them against something and
I just realized again stressing out here
that I actually don't know if this
cooler is compatible with this case it's
probably fine
but you never know there can be there
can be slight differences in clearance
for things like radiators that can cause
a real nightmare for you it looks like
it's going to be fine though so let's go
ahead and pop these screws off of here
and NZXT thoughtfully included a nice
little removable bracket here
okay go ahead and pop that off and then
we've probably got a couple of different
options here in terms of how we want to
mount our radiator and our fans so
there's enough space in the front there
that you could actually put the fans or
the radiator tucked into oh crap well
we'll find this later I've tucked into
the front of the case but that might
affect our air flow a little bit because
if you guys remember that side panel had
that nice little like vented spot on it
so I think what we're gonna do instead
is we're going to mount our radiator
directly to this panel so this should
come with some small radiator mounting
screws yep it does and then we're gonna
mount our fans to the radiator that also
gives us a nice look at our RGB fans
through the windowed side panel if
you're into that sort of thing Nikolai
wants to know if there are LTX videos
coming I think that is pending a
decision from you actually I said I said
I basically didn't care and it was up to
you when Colton asked me so okay and
then the first one okay all right so it
looks it looks like yes we will have at
least one video from LTX I think the the
first thing that we kind of shot they're
thinking it might end up being a video
might not end up being a video but I
mean honestly we were happy to get any
video content out of it LTX was more
about sort of meeting up with the
community in person and it was less
about creating videos like I only spent
maybe 30 40 minutes of my time there
doing stuff that could conceivably have
turned into a video and the rest was
just live engagements like it was it was
a lot of fun I actually challenged
attendees to like the joust the hamster
ball race case toss just you know you
gotta you gotta have fun with stuff like
that and for for us like the whole
secret behind a fun live event was
trying to find ways for us to have fun
so we actually had fewer booths than
last year but attendees are
telling us they had more fun than last
year which doesn't make sense on the
surface except that that was done on
purpose so last year most of our staff
were so busy running booths that they
didn't really have time to interact with
the with the attendees
whereas this time pretty much every
booth had at least two LMG staffers on
it so people could take turns running
them and they have would actually have
time to you know eat or or talk to
people or you know do those things that
you're supposed to do at conventions
Kyle MacIsaac says tell Anthony his
Newfoundland friends miss him oh Anthony
are you over there your your Newfie
friends miss you bro he's he says he he
misses them - they're they're you know
missing missing them yeah getting get in
the car and go out there sorry sorry not
funny
pretty good pretty pretty funny oh okay
good question will there be an LTX on
the East Coast for now the answer is no
because I would rather under promise and
over deliver nothing is impossible
through music but it's a regular show
thing don't worry about it nothing's
impossible but right now there are no
plans whatsoever for an LTX on the East
Coast it's just with the amount of
hassle that it is to get all of our
staff and all of our equipment to the
Richmond Olympic Oval which is like 40
minutes away
I mean imagining being on the other side
of the country and having forgotten a
cable or whatever is just terrifying
terrifying yeah yeah or spending five
hundred dollars on glitter now that
would have been fine that would've been
fine I think they have staples over
there for those of you wondering what
I'm doing right now so I used the short
screws to screw the radiator into this
mounting plate and then I'm using the
long screws to screw my fans into the
radiator here now usually there's enough
play in these long screws that if you
don't need to mount the radiator
directly to something you
go straight through your case through
the fans and then into the radiator with
these it used to be that old radiators
had had some of their the tubes see it's
hard to tell that their tubes cuz
they're so thin but they had tubes
directly under where the screws went in
and you could easily puncture them with
a screw that was too long but nowadays
most of the radiator manufacturers and
screw manual most of the cooler
manufacturers are aware of that
particular problem and they will do a
couple of things they'll make sure that
there's enough sort of play in the
length of the screws before they hit the
fins that it's not going to be a problem
and what they'll also do in some cases
is make sure that there are no tubes
under where the screws go in so you
could never puncture anything anyway oh
can you do anything about the horrible
framerate no yeah yeah so sorry guys
there's really nothing we can do about
it YouTube is as YouTube does we decided
to stream on YouTube today for some
reason and so we're we're we're having
that we're having the YouTube experience
together line is who's your biggest arch
enemy and why is it Luke's mom okay
Luke's mom is not my arch enemy Luke's
mom is awesome
she's great like she has been so
supportive like not just of him but like
of me directly over the years even
though like I hardly knew her and it's
because of me that her son dropped out
of school and ran off to join the circus
like she owed me nothing and she's been
nothing but kind and supportive to me
and him and you know everything that
we've accomplished together so Luke's
Luke's mom is awesome absolutely not my
archenemy assasinate says I subscribed
on floatplane thank you and if you say
hi Dylan I'll be a great day Dylan I
think you got a typo in there but you
can be a great day all you want Dylan
it's like on Dylan's tombstone here lies
Dylan he was a great day
we have a what Oh is it done oh nice
noise here it is you guys wow that looks
fantastic now this is gonna be a bit of
a stretch for your imaginations out
there but imagine this on here imagine
it for just one moment here not too
shabby
not too shabby at all I'm liking it good
work
Thank You Anthony that's super Anthony
over there actually I'm kidding that's
not the real super Anthony the real
super Anthony is our fighting robot that
we are working so that company sent us a
fighting robot and then when we reached
out to them saying like hey could we
borrow another one like we're not asking
you to keep it or anything but we really
feel like a video about a fighting robot
should probably have our robot fight in
it they were like no no we don't we
don't have any left so you you can't
have any more like well like we can wait
till you make another one they're like
no so we're like okay so we reached out
to another creator who also has one and
we are thinking of maybe doing a collab
with that person so that we can actually
watch the super Anthony's fight because
our only other option was to have our
regular Anthony fight the super Anthony
and that was gonna be a pretty one-sided
fight because well I mean they have
weight classes for a reason this robots
like this big like he would have just
been like boom and it would have been
dead what went over G Gnaeus 10 3
whatever it was okay scrapyard Wars is
coming it's coming sooner than you think
unless you think that it's coming on
Saturday in which case it's coming
exactly when you think thank you thank
you for that Nick let's go ahead and do
some thermal compound here really quick
Brandon do you want to get us a good
good shot of this
so we're applying kind of a grain of
rice sized amount of thermal compound
here that's the typical application
method for these smaller processors
bippity Boppity done then this is really
important please peel off label before
you use out there we go so there's our
nice clean copper base there so I
actually need that hardware that I
dropped earlier so I'm gonna go ahead
and do a couple more Super tats are you
gonna liquid metal this PC no I am not
there's a very good reason for that so
liquid metal gives you amazing
performance but it actually has at this
time unknown long term effects like it
does have to be well not unknown you do
have to reapply it every once in a while
which is not something that I'm
necessarily going to assume that the
user of this computer will know how to
do it's a little bit finicky err to
install it takes longer
so between it not having as long
lifespan and taking longer to install
that's pretty much all the reason that
we really need also it's it's dangerous
it can kill your components it's metal
so if someone were to go in and fuss
about with it after the fact and they
accidentally got a little bit of liquid
metal on something they could kill it so
they could very easily kill their CPU or
their motherboard so liquid metal is one
of those things that you know we love
and we love to play around with but that
we don't run out and recommend to our
viewers or go in pre install in systems
that we're building for people if that
if that kind of makes sense corrupt tor
turret 20 bucks yes 20 dollars more than
makes up on the lost ad revenue on the
forum especially because the forum
barely even has ads on it anymore like
yeah the forum has I don't think the
forum has ever made money it's it's
mostly a community initiative at this
point like it's pretty much run by the
community almost no one at LMG puts a
lot of hours into it like Luke still
does some work on it but again it's most
the community and then the community is
what kind of keeps it alive like I post
very little over there most of the staff
is pretty much concentrated on replying
to like comments on float playing videos
over there and stuff like that so the
general forum is just kind of it's as
much a generic tech forum as it is Linus
tech tips it's just that it's
administered by us so sorry oh yeah
sorry I'll change cameras I got this
but it's administered by us so you know
it's well funded it's never gonna go
anywhere
I mean NEVER is a strong word but it's
it's not going anywhere and yeah if you
like it then go I mean honestly there's
a there's a lot of people over there
that don't like Linus tech tips the
YouTube channel want nothing to do with
it but they just like it that it's a
that it's a it's a good online community
so and that's and that's fine that's the
way that we're running it these days and
we're totally cool with that so yeah I
mean the days of making money running a
web forum unless you're running
something very very specialized with
like a very affluent audience like
something very niche I think is a better
way to make money on a web forum then
something more mainstream and it's it's
just it's it's not a good way of making
money
why don't you do case reviews anymore so
the reason we don't do case reviews is
actually the same reason we don't do a
lot of things anymore it's it wasn't a
particularly strong category for us in
terms of viewership like people seemed
to be kind of losing their interest in
it compared to other things and
additionally there's other guys that do
a great job of it like do you really
need to watch dimitri spots on a case
and mine and steve from gamers nexus do
you really need that many reviews of a
case the case sort of you use it I see a
case unless it's a very high-end one as
mostly a one-time-use affair where if
there's something kind of wrong with it
you can kind of fight your way through
that in the initial set up but then
beyond that even though there are cases
out there that don't have great
performance in terms of airflow
the age 500 P was a great example of
that a little while ago it's not like
that was it was so bad that it was gonna
kill your components or anything so it's
one of those components that there's not
really a whole lot that you can totally
screw up like really really badly and if
people just pick what they like they're
gonna mostly end up with a pretty decent
experience so we we just don't care as
much anymore and when you stop caring
and when you stop being excited about
something that is a perfect time to stop
making content about it and leave it to
the guys that are still amped on it and
still really want to talk about it
because I've said this a lot when people
have asked me like how do I become a
youtuber and the answer is always do
what you're legitimately actually
passionate about because if you try to
fake it no one's gonna be fooled and
everyone's gonna hate your content so
we're not about faking it here we want
to make sure that when we're making
videos we're making videos about stuff
that really sort of lights our fire you
know so that would be the main reasons
why we don't really do case reviews
anymore oh boy cable management oh boy
oh boy okay so yes I have decided on a
location for this I'm going to put it in
the heart
oh it's magnetic that's cool that's cool
I got this it's magnetic you could stick
it anywhere you want boom so I'm gonna
put it down there and then I'm gonna run
my USB connector I'm actually gonna do
this fairly early on here and I think
I'm gonna pop this out under the
motherboard here start getting this
wired up this thing is like over 50% of
the total wiring for this build is this
freaking water cooler there we go so
we're gonna throw that USB connector
right there and actually this is great
this motherboard has two USB twos and I
think we are going to need both of them
because I believe the integrated NZXT
hub also wants one yeah it does so we're
gonna need to plug that in as well
perfect
everything's actually going shockingly
smoothly all things considered although
you know famous last words of course
alright I'm gonna go ahead and then I'm
going to take all the RGB connectors
here
sorry I'll give you guys a better look
at that so these are the RGB connectors
for the top two fans or the sorry the
the wait what oh the CPU cooler and then
the front two fans here we're gonna run
all of those over here down to our hub
doodad oh man there's gonna be a bit of
a rat's nest on the bottom of this one
so I apologize in advance to whoever
wins it because there's a big difference
between a build that I have six hours to
work on and a build that I have like two
hours to work on while I'm streaming
yeah oh so for those of you joining us
this is kind of the the 2000 ish dollar
gaming machine it's got a core i7 8700 K
16 gigs of dual channel ddr3 from
g.skill it's got an a sous z 370 Strix
motherboard if I recall correctly I want
to say that it's got e it's got a WD 500
gig m2 SSD it's got a 4 terabyte hard
drive from Seagate it's in an NZXT th
500 I and then it's running an 80 plus
platinum 850 watt power supply from see
sonic down here and of course we are
rocking a GTX 1080 TI for both gaming
and light workstation use and the whole
thing is going to be running an LG ultra
wide 38 inch monitor which you can
actually see in the in the back over
there so that's just waiting for me to
get my crap together and get this
machine built it's just sitting there
patiently waiting it's like it's like
poised you know alright so we've just
jammed all those cables in there as best
we can and we're gonna kind of zip tie
them up a little bit later but that's
that's all I can really do for now
now we're gonna try and find power
connectors for the actual fan
opponents of our fans you know the
important stuff wait oh this is good so
we can actually use interesting we can
use the built-in NZXT thing here to
power our fans yeah why don't we why
don't we do that you know what I really
don't even know if I want to do that I
might just I might just plug into the
motherboard I'm all about that built-in
motherboard control because then you can
even configure profiles in the BIOS and
stuff
we actually have three separate options
for hand controls for this system just
because of the cooler master cooler the
NZXT case and the ACS motherboard so
let's go ahead and see how Asus has
positioned their their plugs and then if
they're good then we'll go with that and
if they're not then I'll use the hub
clever cooling solution for the 2018
macbook actually I did have some
thoughts I think one thing we're gonna
do for sure is liquid metal it the only
reason we hadn't liquid metal to our old
one yet like that's been on our content
calendar for a while was that our new
designer is a Mac and has been using it
so we weren't able to get it from him
so that's that's the thing oh shoot I
plug the the wrong one in I wanted to do
the other one for this sorry give me one
second hearing you guys so we're
probably gonna liquid metal it and see
how much that addresses the problem and
then from there I actually have a couple
of other ideas as well like kind of
think think laptop cooling pad but like
you know it's been hitting the gym so
state stay tuned for that we're gonna
we're gonna see what we can do we're not
going to resort to the freezer as we've
experienced in the past running a
computer in a fridge or freezer actually
is not a great long-term solution though
I know of course Dave Lee did that in
with his tongue firmly planted in his
cheek obviously he knows that is not a
good solution
oh shoot dang it I I had it the right
way this this is the problem this is the
problem with trying to do it live okay
so this one's going up here there we go
so I'm plugging my two fans into two of
my headers on the motherboard here the
top fan is going up to that top one down
there up there and then the bottom one
is going into the one down here there we
go
this is a sort of mid-range board so it
doesn't have a ton of fan connectors on
it's got a couple here actually it's not
bad it's got six but usually I'm used to
seeing more along the bottom edge here
it's a nice place to have them and I
really like that all right then what we
need to do is bring our CPU pump power
back around here
and we're gonna go ahead and plug that
into CPU fan so I had said I was gonna
plug the fans and two CPU optional but I
actually opted not to do that because I
forgot and now they're plugged in so you
know what screw it I will man all right
where's that stupid Y adapter where'd I
put it I think I might have dropped it
okay got it so let's go ahead and unplug
those fans and yet again and we'll we'll
plug this into CPU opt on the other side
here why does anyone take PC building
advice from me again clear clearly no
idea what I'm doing yeah that's not a
thing yeah the winners we already know
the winner well we'll let you know when
we're done building the machine so
that's on there now then right so this
is good this is that Y cable that I
explained earlier I explained why
sorry I apologize but I'm not really
sorry you guys knew that though alright
so there we go now we can run these bad
boys up up this thing with these velcro
ties that's actually gonna that's
actually gonna cable managed pretty
nicely for us in there
I'm liking liking that mostly these kind
of overlap funny I'm not a huge fan of
that but that's okay that's okay we can
we can work with it we can definitely
work with it
we'll run that through there or
something there we go yeah cool okay
that works oh that was exhausting like
you guys are probably exhausted just
watching me do that yeah look like
there's only 24,000 of you watching now
you're tired of watching me install a
CPU cooler and I don't blame you at all
it's horrible but the good news is that
that's not half bad
we actually managed to hide the vast
majority of the wires see we can tuck
this little one coming off of the block
here under this heatsink it's a really
nice little cable management spot we got
the tubes nothing you can do about that
and then this one Y cable here just
wraps around the back and can actually
use that to hide the little ugly
skinnier cable behind it if we if we
want so it looks really clean really
clean from the front oh alright kevin
says love your channel and what you do
don't suppose you have any vacancies for
a UK test manager I don't know what a
test manager is presumably you manage
tests so that's good
we don't administer tests maybe it's
like a Oh like like a reviewer like like
benchmark err no okay okay okay I get it
um so right now we're not really
planning to you know open up a branch
office somewhere else the taxation
implications behind that are actually
incredibly complicated as far as we can
tell most of the industry takes a seek
forgiveness rather than permission
approach to it but that's not really
something that we're comfortable with
like I like to do things by the book
okay when it comes to business things I
like to do them by the book
as a lot of people have gotten and I'm
gonna use sort of air quotes here have
gotten screwed on taxes a lot of small
business owners and the reason that they
got screwed was because in a lot of
cases they weren't staying on top of it
and they weren't doing things properly
as they went so what will happen is
you'll get hit by a gigantic tax bill
that you didn't know you owed because
you didn't do it properly
you'll owe a bunch of interest on it
because you didn't do it properly
and you won't have the money on hand
because you haven't been managing your
cash flow correctly and something that a
lot of people don't realize is that I
actually you know try to run this
business in a way that is a lot to me so
we we really do try to do everything by
the book to the greatest extent that we
can and it's not always possible like
sometimes the the hourly rate for the
the tax lawyer who can advise you about
what to do and in some you know weird
edge case is you know more than you
would have owned if someone came back to
you five years later and was like hey
you owe us this money and you're just
like well you know what we'll cross that
bridge when we get to it and we'll just
we'll just pay it with interest what
else are we supposed to do like it
but a lot of things aren't like that so
we do do our best Oh what else we got
here Skrill
I loved your videos so much and you
inspired me to make my first PhD at 13
did I read that one before hmm what
lives like that our feature for Linus
tech tips consider that hello from PL
says Christophe has do a live builds are
the future oh I don't know they're
really stressful right I was gonna talk
about the whole thing about like being
on camera like you'd think it's
comfortable so it is comfortable but
only in certain situations so one of the
things that's not comfortable for me is
oh dang it I went and I put the screws
for the bottom of the case into the
drives
bloody hell one thing that's not
comfortable for me is stills cameras and
I I joke about this with anyone who's
ever sort of watched me in person
working on shooting a thumbnail for
example you put a video camera in front
of me I'm I'm pretty comfortable like I
can kind of do my thing I can talk to
the camera I can I can multitask
sometimes I'll screw up and I'll use the
wrong screw and I'll put it in the drive
and stuff in the bottom of the case
they're threaded the same like nothing's
ruined or anything it's just I'm wasting
time but I'm pretty good but then you go
and put a spills camera in front of me
and I just lock up like I have no idea
what to do with my hands I have no idea
what face to make and I'm just like this
is very uncomfortable
put it away I hate this so believe it or
not one of the things we've resorted to
around here is actually shooting our
thumbnails as video and then just
pulling us still out of it after the
fact because we shoot on red this is not
a good reason to buy a red camera but
because but because we shoot on red that
8k resolution means that we're really
compromising almost nothing in terms of
the image quality of our thumbnail by
shooting it on a video camera even
though it's really not designed for that
like if you if you called up red you're
like hey so you know we're gonna buy a
red weapon and we're gonna just use it
instead of a DSLR for photography shoots
they they think you're drunk
it'd be like that's the stupidest thing
we've ever heard and yet here we are no
wonder red doesn't talk to us actually I
did have a conversation with red the
other day I pitched them a crazy project
that I sincerely hope that they will you
know put the past in the past and work
with us on because that would be the
best thing ever like let let us let us
actually let us know in the comments you
guys want to see a Linus tech tips red
digital cinema collaboration on
something kind of crazy
I'd love to I'd love to know what you
guys imagine it would be because it's
it's something that I suspect most of
you wouldn't guess
it's pretty neat so what I'm doing right
now is I'm installing the hard drive
this case not a great hard drive
installation experience I personally
prefer here so I personally prefer like
plastic rails that you can just slide
the drives in from the back but what
this approach with the little metal cage
down here and all screws does is a
couple of things one is that it allows
you to put a third drive up on the top
so that's pretty neat you can screw that
in with the little tabs on the side then
you can put two more down here so they
get an extra drive out of it and then
number two is that it requires the
assembler to use all screws and NZXT has
a very close relationship with iBUYPOWER
so they've they've got a lot of they've
got a lot of people there with a proud
system builder pedigree and system
builders know that nothing beats a screw
if you have like you know rock paper
scissors
screw screw is the way to go if you want
something to arrive to the end-user
not having completely fallen apart in
shipping so I understand why they did it
it's just a bit more of a hassle for me
to assemble but now whoever wins this
machine and the monitor is going to have
a working system when it arrives
hopefully so that's definitely a good
thing all right so our drives in now we
can grab SATA power harness so I think
this single modular harness is actually
going to handle everything that we need
to plug into it plot our plug in with
SATA so we're gonna run a couple things
so we've got the NZXT fan controller hub
up there so we can go ahead and I don't
know let's use let's say the third one
for that one we've got our cooler master
hub down here okay that one goes in a
little something like that actually I'm
gonna use the third one for this drive
here and then we've got this drive right
here you want to be really careful with
these SATA connectors they're a little
bit fragile so you just need to make
sure you've got them aligned exactly
right they're keyed so they only go in
one way just look closely and then you
push them straight in don't put any
upward or downward pressure on them
because if you do that there's a good
chance you'll snap the connector off the
drive and it typically costs
more to try to replace that connector
than it would to just buy a new drive so
that's a bad time don't want to do that
all right
oh man see this is what I hate about
these stupid little these stupid little
male-to-male RGB pin things I just bent
that one just doing basically nothing to
it it's okay we can just pop it back on
and if anything now that it's bent it
might stay on a little bit better
they also come off really really easily
as quite frustrating so we're gonna you
know I might need to pop this off while
I put it in so let's put that baby in
there all right maybe I'll do a couple
super chats while I'm CUBAN managing
this stuff ah sir cloud says for $5 sir
cloud paid $5 just to burn me Lois draw
up tubes
thank you sir cloud for your
contribution both monetarily
and intellectually to this conversation
we're having here for this super chat as
it were oh yes we cut here Eduardo says
still can't believe Linus can make all
sorts of builds but is not able to use a
Mac okay now hold on a minute in fair
okay in fairness to me if I have the
power of Google on my side I can use a
Mac it's just that I don't use them
every day and I haven't used one as a
daily driver in probably about two and a
half three years so let's see you you
know put down your Windows computer for
three years and then go back and
remember how to do everything all right
all right I want to see that before
you're gonna burn me on my Mac skills
okay yes I know that I should probably
be better at it as a as a tech guy but
it just doesn't come up that often like
the only time I ever really need to use
a Mac is when I'm working on a review of
something and now that Alex handles most
of the laptop stuff that comes in even
that doesn't come up that often so yeah
Anthony did the iMac Pro so
okay I've been live for an hour and 40
minutes that's fine believe it or not
we're actually surprisingly close to the
end it's it's hard to tell as you're
going but the whole thing kind of comes
together in the final moments like
Brandon and I would always have this
experience when we were shooting build
guides back in the day where we'd be
like everything's like check like look
at this like everything's exploded all
over the table everything's a mess and
then we'd be like hold on a minute all
you got to do is put the GP yeah we're
almost done that's great all right so
the last couple of things that I've got
here I've got to do my data for the hard
drive but I'm gonna do that later
because it's that's a particularly
fragile connector we don't want to bump
it so all I've got to do is my front
panel case connectors here so what is
this front power switch and stuff I
don't see them Oh Andrew hi Andrew yes
there is a story behind the orange
branding that's really funny I I have
built almost no computers with any
screwdriver other than my orange one
that was a gift that I got about 15
years ago and so that that orange
branding came from my my partner in
crime back at NCIX who helped me run the
NCIX tech tips channel integrating that
that screwdriver that I always had and
refused to use anything but it he
integrated that into the branding of
NCIX tech tips so we had kind of the
blue and the yellow of NCIX and then we
also had this this screwdriver in there
and then because that was just sort of
you know it was sort of like meme status
by the time - tech tips was started it
became part of the Linus tech tips
branding as well so it's just kind of it
all comes from that snap-on screwdriver
that I would use all the time there's
nothing sort of more more sentimental
about it than that it just was the color
of my screwdriver so we simply rolled
with it
thanks sir cloud I'm not forgiving you
though so you know ah okay let's do our
front USB three connector this guy's
really fragile you want to be careful
with this one I actually really don't
like the position of this connector and
the way that this case is designed here
they don't go together very well because
it's a really bulky connector and a
really bulky cable so you can see it's
going to put some upward pressure on it
if we cable management cable manage it
really tight so what we're probably
gonna do is we're gonna make a cable
management compromise and we're gonna
run our USB 3 connector out through
where we would normally run the GPU
power because the last thing I want is
for someone to get this machine and have
their front USB 3 not work it's better
to make a compromise on cable management
than to make a compromise on the
functionality of your machine so we're
gonna go ahead and do that I mean it's
not the end of the world because we're
gonna hide that a little bit when we
bring those PCI Express cables up but I
just thought I'd I'd acknowledge that
now is there any chance of a cloud
gaming video I'm glad you asked because
we actually had a sponsor who runs a
cloud gaming service reach out to us and
we might be going to see their actual
data center where the cloud gaming
happens so stay tuned for that we've got
our USB 2 connector for that NZXT
controller that's built in so we're
plugging that into our other USB 2
header those are keyed they only go in
one way
then we've got we got HD audio
high-definition the highest definition
audio it's funny we don't even have the
video industry to blame for this
HD nonsense its audio okay so that's
plugging in there that's keyed it only
goes in one way typically these are in
the sort of bottom left of the
motherboard and all the other USB stuff
is in the along the bottom edge and this
is something I haven't seen and I really
don't like NZXT typically I think I've
actually given them a lot of praise
throughout this video for the good
decisions that they make when they're
building their cases this is not one of
them they have integrated all of the
front panel connectors the power reset
and the LEDs
into a single gear which on the surface
seems like a good idea and might even
work today although I'll have to check
the pin outs on this particular
motherboard but if you run into a
situation where you need any other
configuration and other boards
especially across generations are not
standard this is a real pain in the butt
to reconfigure you can do it you just
need to take like a pin or a needle or
something you pop up these little flaps
pull the pins out and then put them in
wherever you need them but that is so
much more of a hassle especially for
experienced builders where I can just
take all the loose wires hold it in my
hand and put the whole thing on myself
that is so much more of a hassle than
being able to reconfigure them as I need
so I'm gonna go ahead and assume that
the one button missing here is a reset
switch and that everything else is wired
up correctly and hope for the best I
mean if the industry does manage to
standardize on this great but even if it
does just in case someone's buying this
case for a motherboard that's a couple
years old that is a conceivable thing
that could happen i I think it should
probably be a few more years before you
run out and integrate that standard into
a case but I'm sure NZXT has their own
sort of thoughts on the situation and
they and they don't agree and that's
fine that's that's the beauty of the
world we live in people have the right
to disagree and then I have the right to
disagree right back in your face all
right so this is over here this all
looks pretty good let's go ahead and run
this the CPU power connector into this
one right here I'm sorry I'm probably
writing your way but there's nothing I
can really do about it we'll just do it
as quick as I can okay so that's in
there now look at that Brandon it
happened it happened we've got all this
kind of mess going on right now and
everything and we're like just about
done it is time to do the graphics card
love that so Oh before I do that yes
what's up
oh yeah no I think the viewers did a
great job of choosing the parts that
water-cooler was a nightmare to install
but otherwise pretty good you want to
frame me for a bit of headroom yeah cool
cuz of me I'm not gonna need the table
much anymore thanks Brandon yeah I
thought they did a great job I mean that
water cooler was a nightmare to
installed but I'm sure we're gonna feel
that it was all worthwhile once we see
the RGB lighting effects and other than
that I mean there's nothing in here that
I would really question I mean it's all
reputable brands MSI graphics they cease
on the motherboard Western Digital and
Seagate for the storage I think it's
gonna look really good when we're done
and we fire this thing up and this
thing's performance is going to be
fantastic like this is a good
all-rounder you could save some money
like if you were building a pure gaming
machine you could save probably a few
hundred dollars on this configuration if
you're just like yeah I don't give two
cares what it looks like I don't care
how cool it runs and I don't care what
my you know video rendering times are
gonna be you could save a significant
amount of money but this is more of an
all-rounder machine that'll perform well
across a broad spectrum of different
workloads and looked good doing it and
run efficiently and all of that kind of
good stuff that's so it's got a lot of
nice extras even if you don't
necessarily need them all oh so this was
the only RGB cooler that was an option
all right the people the people have
spoken
RGB is in Brandon do you want to just
take this do you want to just control
the angles like why are we letting me do
this yeah yeah
we're gonna do that we're gonna do the
final component install okay I am
seriously not a fan of the way that
these PCI slots are configured on this
case this is not my favorite thing ever
I get this whole vertical GPU mounting
thing is a big deal right now and that's
really cool but I don't like you can
here I can barely get a screwdriver in
there to get the PCI cover off not not
like in that I don't have I don't have
like a constructive suggestion for how
we can fix it but I can definitely
complain and ask the engineers over at
NZXT to engineer better for next time oh
wow this is gonna make it really hard to
get this card into I do not like this I
do not like inaccessible screws and ham
I do not like them so actually I love
ham I don't like inaccessible screws
though oh this whole bracket comes off
okay they didn't think of it fantastic
good and that XT engineers are like
cringing into their faces going like
taking off the thing okay it's still
flimsy yeah well you know what I figured
it out pretty quick so I'm still I'm
still giving myself a b-minus on this BB
- B - yeah you never heard of rocket
surgery Brandon well brain science is a
thing yeah okay fair enough they
wouldn't have to do quite so much of it
if they didn't keep blowing them up um
all right so this guy is gonna go in
here now
just get that aligned pop that in ha ha
it just doesn't look like a gaming
machine without that beefy graphics card
installed you know see see I knew it
that's the money shot moment of a PC
build it's getting that getting that
powerful graphics card in there so
people were into it as long as we were
like putting in the CPU and the RAM and
then like power supply oh yeah yeah
what's that GPU how many frames is gonna
get yeah that's better that's what
people have more than this extreme for
sure that's what people get amped about
man
still can't believe - wait oh no I'm not
reading that again watching with my
five-year-old daughter she says hi and
wonders when my computer will look like
yours when you stopped giving me $10 for
super chats and spend it on your
computer actually I don't know maybe it
already does maybe it already does look
the the one the one youtuber that teases
people about spending money on super
chats you saw it here first folks
- tech tips yeah yeah exactly that's
right so we actually gave away a pair of
Gucci sandals at LTX did that make it
into J's vlog no okay it was it was
pretty it was pretty dumb it was
definitely dumb out of 10 so I'm putting
in the - eight pin power connectors for
the GPU this is one of the most common
missed steps I'm not gonna call it a
misstep because it's not actually a huge
deal it totally doesn't matter you can
just it just won't post and then you'll
be like oh why isn't it posting and
you'll put in these power connectors but
it's one of the most common missed steps
when you're building a machine and then
you realize oh no it's not working it's
because you need to plug in these extra
power connectors over here yeah shout
out to Brandon for being awesome
did someone super chat that oh no that's
just you five bucks five bucks
ah all right what else we got here Ian
says my gaming laptop cost two thousand
two oh no my laptop battery died all
right no that's fine it's fine got this
got this got my got my Tesla
charger here in my backpack you know
never leave home without it
that's right that'll make sense in time
or if you follow on Twitter it might
already make sense but if
it probably doesn't ask let's go ahead
and turn that laptop back on there and
theoretically I don't want to I don't
want to speak out of turn here but
theoretically this system should post so
let's go ahead and let's go ahead and
clear some space here and see if Lady
Luck is smiling upon us today or if if
I've dropped one thing too many during
this build and it's not gonna not gonna
fire up for us here no I don't need the
panels yet no it's okay so the most
important PC building advice that I can
give to anyone is you never put on the
panels before you power it up for the
first time it's bad luck and I don't
believe in luck I don't believe in
horoscopes I don't believe in astrology
it's all nonsense but you never put the
panels on until you've powered it up
it's bad luck but I don't believe in
luck but it's bad luck all right I hope
that was very clear to everyone clear
clear as mud all right so let's go ahead
and pop these power supply cables over
here pop our tools down there pop these
manuals you know what I'm just gonna
make someone else sort this stuff out
when I'm done so I'm just gonna throw
everything down there aha Oh ha see and
this my friends is exactly why because
we didn't put the SATA data cable in yet
and we were gonna be like ooh what
happened why isn't our hard drive
detected because as soon as you as soon
as you put that panel on you'll have
you'll have forgotten and you'll realize
as you're cleaning up or whatever that
you never put that thing in like oh this
sucks now I have to take out screws
there's nothing less fun in the PC
building universe then taking apart
computers building them fun taking them
apart not fun Jake actually had to
disassemble the the dual system be
over the last couple of days and it's
just like depressing because you put all
this work into it and it's like so cool
and awesome and then you have to take it
apart and like clean out the gunk that
build up in the blocks and like really
tedious and then when you're left
instead of getting like the satisfaction
of that moment when it turns on and
everything lights up you're left with a
pile of parts that you get to put back
on the shelf because we're done with it
alright so let's get our SATA data cable
here and actually I'm cheating a little
bit on this build instead of installing
Windows cuz I don't think you guys want
to watch all that because that's boring
I just grabbed an SSD and I'm gonna I'm
gonna boot off of that in order to make
sure that the rest of the components are
working so I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna
use the right angle connector on this
bottom drive here so we've got lots of
room to tuck the rest of our cables here
it doesn't really matter we could easily
use a straight one I like how much space
sends that XE has given us there once
again more praise for them they just
didn't do everything right on this case
and then I'm gonna go ahead and plug
that into any port on the motherboard
been a long time since mainstream boards
have really needed third-party chipsets
like non Intel chipsets in order to have
enough ports free to plug in as many
drives as you'd want so you don't have
to worry as much these days about which
port you plug things into then I'm gonna
use that last SATA connector I had I'm
just gonna run it outside of the case
here Boop and I'm gonna go ahead and
plug that in over here so I actually
need a keyboard and mouse would it be
possible to get that someone who's off
camera do you mind cool thank you and do
I have a network cable over here
probably I think so
well yeah it's that stupid when I was
ranting about earlier I mean look at
this okay
whoever did this who works here you're
getting called out right now because
this is ridiculous so this this cable
these two cables this one over here
that's under the carpet and this one
here are for this workshop set and for
the old Blanchot set and they used to
run back here behind all these like
painting supplies under this shelf over
to the server room someone went out of
their way to take them out of
there and run them up here with this
growth tape that leaves a bunch of
residue on stuff over the top of this
counter and then back down so now it's a
tripping hazard by the door who does
that sort of thing what's it you Jake no
okay well good someone did that someone
just got called out because that was bad
that was like super fail uh yeah I do
all right let's go ahead oh you know
what we need we need a monitor oh hi -
Justin I adjusted that height real good
all right
let's go ahead and pop that on there we
need our power cord oh this is what this
is when it gets exciting when it's like
okay we're getting to the moment we're
getting to the turn-on moment that's
what turns me on
okay run this over here so when do we
when do we say who wins this thing
whenever I want
oh cool okay well I don't want to yet I
want to do it I want to do it later so
how did people how did people enter this
just turn on whoo okay hold on hold on
no no I want everything plugged in
before we do that it's like we don't
want to blow the proverbial you know
what let's keep it pg
got it
okay okay so in case that was too far
from my microphone for you guys to hear
people voted by voting or people entered
to win by voting for the components for
five days so there were four components
that got voted on and then on the fifth
day people submitted sort of fun ideas
for the build like itching the panel
with memes for example so we're gonna
announce who was drawn randomly out of
the people who participated very shortly
here but I really want to see it I want
to see it booted and maybe even running
a game first because that would be
pretty sick key step get off get off
this is making it worse how did this get
so tangled look do you guys ever have
these experiences we're like two things
touch each other and then all of a
sudden they're just like permanently
fused together for some reason all right
here's our power brick for the monitor
needs a pretty hefty power brick because
it's like a lot of pixels and whatnot
right
HDR backlight let's go ahead and put got
my DisplayPort cable yeah you're gonna
want DisplayPort I know if this one runs
at its full refresh rate and resolution
on HDMI but I but I would have to check
that for you guys I don't know we can do
that after it let's let's uh let's show
let's let's get it being assembled first
we'll show the putting on the panel and
doing whatever else it is that we're
doing and then we can get some honorable
mentions in there all right so I'm gonna
actually use my front USB port for my
mouse just to make sure that those work
well those are cute they're purple in
this case then but where's that all the
network cable is over there because
we're streaming off of it that makes an
awful lot of sense okay
does someone want to get jaku and see if
we can grab a switch for it or something
all right here we go
it's time to boot
are you ready Brandon hmm okay so
did I forget to plug in the power for
the Coolermaster hub that seems possible
wait oh no that's just the interesting
that's just the lighting for the board
that's just standby lighting so you
don't actually have to have the system
powered on for that to work interesting
all right so now we're powered up but
I'm actually still not seeing any RGB to
those fans so it is entirely possible
that that hub is not powered no it must
be powered because the fans are spinning
I guess it's possible that we have to
configure it in cooler masters utility
or something like that okay I don't know
if I ever turn the monitor on though so
that's probably a key step there's been
somewhat anticlimactic I apologize on
HDMI let's go ahead and switch our input
now we're on DisplayPort fun little fun
little thing about DisplayPort is that
it doesn't always do a fantastic job of
picking up a signal that's thank you
that's already running so I've from my
experience it's actually a pretty good
idea to go ahead and turn the system
right back off and then power it back on
I don't know what it is about DP but it
just it's not as good as HDMI which
isn't as good as DVI at just detecting
the signal and going I miss DVI
sometimes but DVI was limited to 2560 by
1600 60 Hertz so it was clearly not the
display interface of the future there we
go there's the ROG moment that's weird
why does it have an our own ROG oh yeah
SAS Trix board oh yeah how about that
okay cool
make sure to use the supplied input
cables okay can do no problem and then
this is the moment in the video where I
would normally go okay Brandon go ahead
and cut and we'll we'll be back in a
while when there's something interesting
to look at but instead I'm gonna do
super chats what do we got here Oh
someone spent 10 euros and then
retracted their message who does that
Wow um okay then there's there's 70
roubles from a name that I have no
chance like not a hope in anything of
pronouncing because it's all in like
what is it Cyrillic no was whatever the
like Russian characters are I got I got
nothing Lucas says thanks to your videos
I built my best PC following your
recommendations 8700 KP 4000 also this
is like a workstation machine not bad
Paul sent 30 box and says hey Linus
bought that motherboard for my RG build
RGB illed r do you know what fans would
you recommend them where are the pins
for it oh yeah I think this board does
have our GB headers yeah they're both at
the bottom kind of in the middle to the
left dish and of course there's light
loops are fantastic of course but I
think they really rely on Corsairs
hugg to plug them into anyway I don't
think Corsair has built
Oris into or are a sink sorry are a sink
into IQ yet witcher 3 and LTTE worst
combo says Pavlin our PG schizo says hi
from india and - media group taylor says
still voting for the PC Co build with
hardware connects I'd be kind of fun I
mean we kind of did that in scrapyard
Wars last season Dimitri and I built oh
hey we're booted caution make sure to
use the supplied input cables oh oh
there's clothes and then there's do not
display this message again I think I'll
go with do not display this message
again this time also that's not
necessary as long as you get a high
quality thing then you should be good ok
alrighty then so here it is let's make
sure everything's detected can I get a
mousepad from someone oh no I have one I
have an emergency mousepad where's my
backpack I don't know people will make
fun of me when I feel like I've
legitimately had this happen when I pull
out a mousepad at like the airport or
something and I'm like yo I've got stuff
to do like I can't be using a touchpad
for everything always carry Mouse always
carry mousepad so that's necessary no no
no it was it was this one it was just
this ancient steel series one I actually
really need a new one stuff doesn't
track that well and it's kind of worn
out ok cool so we're booted let's make
sure everything is actually detecting
here good work Jake ah there's our
Kingston Drive there's our 4 terabyte
drive I actually don't see our MDOT two
SSD which is weird we will have to
diagnose that a little bit later but we
can do that off camera we're booted up
for now everything else looks to be
showing up we've got our gtx 980ti
and let's go ahead and get our monitor
settings dialed in this is always fun
you know booting up a machine for the
first time and kind of you know setting
up everything especially when you get to
BAM change your refresh rate from
60 to 75 Hertz it actually makes more of
a difference than you'd probably think
like going from 60 to 75 or 85 is a
bigger Delta for me than going from like
120 to 144 or 165 anything over 60 feels
pretty good if all you've ever
experienced is 60fps before so I mean
what should we should we go should we go
full cringe and fire up fortnight I mean
is that do we not have epic games
launcher on here some of our test
benches actually are not are not set up
for for fortnight nonsense
it's got battlenet though so we could do
like overwatch no it's doesn't know the
password in it okay forget it we're just
gonna you know well let's just run the
Deus Ex mankind divided benchmark well
once again I'm just gonna have to cover
my keyboard here are we are recovered
Brendan alright I have no idea if I
actually entered that right I'm thinking
probably not oh I get it
Oh Christian says been following since
your NCIX days like the build
Zachary says but can it run crisis oh
I'd love to know where´s we're steam can
it run Crysis Crysis 1 ok let's get that
downloading in the background there hey
come on come on you know we got to do it
I'll downloads during gameplay and we're
good that is that is downloading
oh no it's doing a bunch of updates no
no I don't want to do no updates good
let's do it let's download crisis first
how the biggest crisis
I remember crisis being like a big game
at one point but now five and a half
gigs is like nothing there's games out
there that are 60 gigs and more alright
let's play big Deus Ex mankind divided
Lars thanks for buying up all the ends
ethics cases on prime day before I got
one no we bought this well before prime
day our production calendar actually
runs pretty far out in advance
George sent over 40 rubles with the
message
From Russia With Love thanks George
that's on point Scott 10 pounds what has
happened to the 1000d build that is
exactly the one I was talking about that
that Jake had to tear down and that made
him super sad so it has been torn down
because we have to salvage that hardware
for other builds in fact we had to clear
there's might still be some remnants no
we had to clear like that the shelves of
video cards and SSDs from that build out
of the workshop right before we shot
this it just got torn down what's the
total stream lag I think it's pretty
short I think it's only like 10 20
seconds something like that yeah it's
pretty low all right so let's start by
changing our resolution from 1920 by
1080 yeah I know it requires more video
memory but we're mad ballers cuz we got
a 1080i 38 40 by 1600 75 Hertz let's see
how close we can get to that 75 FPS line
I I'm not my expectations are actually
fairly low this is a really demanding
game and it's on the high preset right
now so let's pop into the extras here
benchmark I can't remember if this one
has a frame counter that you can look at
the whole time but I'm gonna go ahead
and do some super chats toasted hey I
sent 5 pounds before it and you missed
it no we just haven't gotten to it yet
these messages are from an hour and 25
minutes ago so I'm gonna try and go
through them pretty quick since there is
no FPS counter we're just gonna have to
wait till this benchmark is done in
order to get the results better than
Sandler says can I get this PC I am at
colleague and it's hard to spend money I
think you mean college better than
sander and sorry the the way to win has
already been closed but I think we're
doing some more PC giveaways before the
end of this year right some like build
giveaways yeah so stay tuned stay tuned
Emmanuel 20 bucks hey Linus I have a few
question on billing my first PC from the
ground up I'm acutely using the same
motherboard can I send you an
male with my parts list and get your
opinion on it the best place to go is
our forum we actually have a new-build
section of the forum where you can post
what your machines for there's a whole
like there's guidelines and everything
for how you can post and then we've got
an amazingly helpful community that'll
walk you through that that is one of the
biggest reasons that we started the
forum so that I wouldn't have to answer
these questions every time and for that
the forum has actually been an amazing
resource because our community does an
amazing job of it it's it's it's been
really cool and that's why we'll keep
supporting the forum no matter how
unprofitable it is we don't care
rage modding says Dennis live build okay
that is actually something that we might
do at some point dennis has expressed an
interest in hosting more content so he's
going to be doing a tech wiki soon do
you know that yeah so Dennis will be
hosting a fast as possible and then
apparently he also wants to do a tech
linked Ryan says would you rather be a
meme or a gif
I'd rather be a gif of a meme actually
so excuse me
benchmark results hey not bad wow it's
almost like we built this machine to run
on this monitor we got 60 2.6 FPS
average which means on average we would
need that higher than 60 Hertz refresh
rate and our max was 75 point 1 FPS so
we are literally getting the full
potential out of our build and out of
our monitor it's nice when things
balance out like that isn't it but can
it run crisis first time set up see what
I want to know is why it doesn't do
first time setup when I install the game
oh wow we have to install punkbuster
lordy pit Zed x2 is it bad that I'm
running a risin 5 1600 with a gtx 750ti
in 2018 no not necessarily I mean it's
just the next thing I would probably
upgrade about that rig is the GPU but
lots of people do that
where they'll do a platform upgrade keep
the power supply keep their GPU like
keep everything they can and then
they'll do like rolling upgrades so then
they'll do a GPU and then a new power
supply if necessary and
then they'll try and stretch that CPU
for a little bit longer I mean that's a
great way to manage your money without
going on a payment plan because leasing
and financing is not better in the long
term whereas buying bits and pieces like
buying whatever the best value pieces
now especially with the way that so many
components are inter compatible from
generation to generation can be a really
good way to manage your overall amount
of money that you have to put down at
once and still keep your system modern
ends ethics case NZXT cases are too
expensive here says laz FPS and their
currency is a w with two horizontal
lines through it I have no idea what
that is is that what I don't know I
think I think I don't know okay moose
what's the most expensive thing you have
worked on for LMG it's actually the
upcoming six video editors one CPU I
think so that's gonna be like a fifty to
sixty thousand dollar machine like not
even including the monitors it's
freaking crazy no I don't want to launch
Conrad GameSpy comrade part of the
crisis install Aiden
hey Linus English and Royal Air Force
here did you or any of your team ever
consider a military career actually yes
but only briefly I have bad knees I've
actually got rheumatoid arthritis so
that wasn't going to be an option for me
because things like marching or even
standing for long periods of time can be
really hard on them
what's art in the game cannot start for
security reasons only a limited number
of machines can ever be licensed by a
single purchase this limit has been
reached please purchase another
registration code reinstall and then try
again how do you even do that
on a game like Crysis like can you
unbind a game from your Steam library
but can you can you even do that I don't
even think you can do that how would you
fix that
Wow eat a gigantic whatever reproductive
organ is most offensive to you Wow
so no it can't run crisis but I'm
blaming some combination of Crytek ei
and whoever else was responsible for
that game actually did I published the
first one I'm not sure I can't remember
so I'm okay I don't know I'm not gonna
blame EA if it's not EA but you know
what no it's blame EA anyway
no it's fine don't don't worry about it
I mean it was just for the memes anyway
I think we're pretty much done here the
only thing left is the winner and also
some other talking points I'm supposed
to boom I got my cable caught there and
also some other talking points so the
machine works
so that's that's good that's always
stressful when we have to announce a
winner live like hey you won well don't
worry we'll get it working before we
send it out so it's working and we get
to tell you that do I have the winner in
this doc there we go so the winner of
the PC is this is a difficult name but
I'm gonna do my best they're from Canada
hey that's freaking awesome ripping my
my Canadian my Canadian brothers sister
not sure the name is Yoshi Yoshi V from
Canada so she okay hey cool
so you will be receiving some contact
from us we will get in touch with you
about Oh No LLG we'll be in touch via
email to confirm the win and speak to
you about delivery options you're gonna
be getting this PC oh we didn't put the
we didn't put the edge panel on it where
is it baby beauty is there anything else
that we have to do for the memes yeah
fine I don't really want to I think it's
I don't know if it's the best I do want
to put this etched tempered glass side
panel on here though this is fantastic
so
adds a touch of a touch of uniqueness to
the build and then I think one of the
other ideas contributed by our viewers
to make the system just one-of-a-kind is
to have it signed by the Linus tech tips
team so I'm gonna go first but we're
gonna cover the entire front panel the
signatures every one here and there you
have it a one-of-a-kind high performance
gaming machine ultrawide monitor
Congrats to Shoshi V from Canada and let
me just see if there's anything else
that I got a that I gotta get going on
here yeah I'll do some honorable mention
some of the other kind of silly ideas
were scratching sponsored by LG into the
bottom of the case it would kill me to
just put scratches on this thing at this
point someone wanted me to paint a
sandal print on the front panel I mean
if you guys really want that I did bring
an extra sandal today like we could we
could we could throw some we could throw
some paint on there I feel like we'd be
routing it okay Brandon thinks we'd be
ruining it Brandon yeah bear if show she
wants it we will put a sandal print
right on the top one idea was to put on
a different shirt every time I added a
component I actually kind of liked that
one Oh another shirt oh I'd be sweating
so much oh I would die no I'd be I'd be
dead by this point in the strain I've
been streaming for over two hours I'd be
dead under studio lights I'm already
dying that and you guys would barely be
able to hear me because I'm wearing a
lavalier microphone under my shirt I've
actually had a lot of people ask how we
do our audio because they can't see the
mic I've got a whole system hey have
there been any comments on my shirt has
anyone even noticed that I'm like
repping gamers Nexus today oh okay well
yeah I don't know I picked this today
because I was like hey we're doing a
livestream maybe I'll uh
maybe I'll rep the gamers Nexus I would
else we got oh okay so those figurines
those 3d printed figurines that LG has
sent me over the years
one of them we auctioned for charity at
LTX last year if I recall correctly one
of them is gone and I have kept the
other one just
because I don't know it's kinda it's
it's a pretty cool memento of this
period of my life you know when I'm old
and irrelevant and my grandkids can't
relate to me you know I can show them
that figurine sort of the way I envision
it so that one wasn't really up for
grabs those are those would be pretty
expensive to replace and it also you
know the meaning is hard to replace I
want to I want to take a selfie with the
picture though or what the selfie with
the picture I want to take a selfie with
the system though let's get that done
that was one of the suggestions with my
system taking them live selfies I've
actually had been coached on my selfie
game by people who have attended
conventions or that I've run into it
shows and stuff because I really am NOT
apparently that good at it so that's
great to know thanks guys um I think
that pretty much wraps it up if I didn't
get to your super chat at this point I
think all I can really do is sincerely
apologize because I totally suck I'll do
a couple more before we go though yeah
thank you of course for your support we
had no idea what like this super chat
thing did or whatever nhd 15 should I
get a water a iOS's Andre no NHD 15 is
excellent aviation Pro it skipped to the
bottom okay let's do some recent ones
Jana's jens e boy pc inside an old CRT
ultimate sleeper yes we are considering
that we are working on that actually
we're actively working on that Joris i
need to know how to fix that crisis
problem i'm sorry i've got nothing for
you
hey Linus today is my birthday I got 300
bucks what's the best keyboard and
headset I can get okay
headset super personal keyboard if you
want wireless Corsairs got a really good
wireless gaming mechanical keyboard
personally I mean I'm partial to
anything with Cherry MX browns but I'm
sort of a mostly typer little bit gamer
if you're more of a gamer a lot of
people recommend Reds I personally hate
them and if you're peer typist then and
you don't have people around to get
annoyed with you then blues are a good
choice Sean Park says Linus what
are you using to make your test bench
harddrive I thought you can't take a
hard drive from a different PC with
Windows already installed common
misconception in most cases you can do
that it doesn't really matter and
Windows will do that thing it'll detect
new Hardware on first boot but a lot of
the time if you're not like going from
AMD to Intel it'll it'll pull it off
just fine
Tyler says fly me up there and teach me
everything Tyler for 10 bucks I
unfortunately can't but you know you
might have an opportunity in the future
we're gonna do some giveaways that will
involve traveling up here and building a
machine with me
kay unveils for five euros says not
really related to this build but is the
Jean Mimi mix to s still your daily
driver no right now I'm using the
samsung galaxy s 9 plus for $1000 can I
be a lifetime member to floatplane
probably I think yeah yeah that works
out in our favor I think you're better
off with the three bucks a month or even
five when it probably goes up to that
yeah waffle says you're great I love
your vids thanks waffle Henry says good
two hundred to two hundred and seventy
dollars GPU see I only look at GPU
pricing when I'm like working on a
project so I'm gonna guess GTX to GTX
1063 gig not knowing if that's actually
that price but that one's a really good
value failing that the 1050 Ti is pretty
good rx 570 and 580 are both good values
assuming that the price things not
jacked up by minors let's see how much
of 1063 gig is to 240 to 270 nailed it
go - it's a birthday from Kamloops with
love says Alex hey Kamloops you know
Kamloops I was actually in Kamloops once
when I saw like a drug addict walked out
from an alley in front of me and then
literally pass out while standing up
right in front of me I was like 11 at
the time it was very traumatic
yeah people rushed to help him you know
good people of Kamloops were like right
in there they were on top of that so
that was really good Calvin sent 20
bucks saying staying still trying to get
rid of that beanbag that you tried to
dump on iJustine name in vancouver can
maybe use a beanbag chair if not I tried
you know what Calvin sure sure you can
come pick it up email the the email that
we have listed on the Tube channel and
say that I said you could have it but
you're gonna have to provide
verification that this is actually your
YouTube account so they know all right
so I think we're gonna cut off the
stream now we're gonna get everyone to
come in and sign this thing after thank
you guys so much for your patience how
long have we been going to hours and 23
minutes thank you to LG for sponsoring
this live ultra wide build and thank you
to Brandon for putting up with being the
camera guy audio guy live video switcher
guy lighting guy am I missing anything
you're kind of a grip too like you like
moving around the like ladder and stuff
so peace out guys we will see you on our
next livestream which might take another
year I don't know it's been more than a
year I think yeah it might give them
more often let you guys vote on the
components Brandon you have my you have
my eye that can't end the stream yeah
yeah yeah yep or okay yeah I can do it
