hardware combination this is an Intel
server board ok and this particular one
is the S 1200 KP and then I also have a
matching Intel Xeon processor so this is
an e 312 60 L so that's a 2.4 gigahertz
xeon chip and what this is meant for is
low power low heat output applications
where you need server reliability so
it's no secret that Intel makes
motherboards I mean it's not something
that I've really done too much of on my
particular channel but they do make
motherboards it's also no secret that
Intel makes some of the most reliable
knotted boards out there so if you were
going to build something like a very
small form-factor
server machine whether it's for home use
or SMB use you're going to throw it in a
closet somewhere and basically forget
about it I don't see a reason why you
wouldn't want to use a configuration
like this another possible application
based on the motherboard itself which
I'll actually here I'll get into that in
a minute just look at the accessories
would be something like a I like an AZ
or a storage server if you don't want to
use a pre box solution you want to use a
custom software or something like that
you could use a product like this so in
terms of included accessories there's
not a whole lot there's an i/o shield
there are two SATA cables although I got
to say they feel pretty darn high
quality for included SATA cables nice
we've got a little diagram of all the
stuff on the board which you don't need
because I'm about to tell you all the
stuff on the board we've got Intel
enabled acceleration server acceleration
Alliance okay we've got the Intel server
board quick reference which shows you
how to install your stuff on the thing
and finally we have a driver disk which
you shouldn't use you should download
the latest off the Intel website so now
let's have a look at the board itself
LGA 1155 socket so you're going to want
to use a Z on on this particular board
which is not really that different from
a desktop core i5 or Core i7 processor
other than the additional validation
that a Xeon ship goes through so when
you buy server grade
opponents you are paying for reliability
so that's what it brings to the table so
you've got your Zeon pocket here you've
got a PCI e 16x slot here which means
you can use this for almost any number
of things because that 16x lot gives you
the potential to put a raid card in here
it gives you the potential to put a very
advanced network card in here or
whatever else that you would want to do
in terms of included RAM support we've
got dual ddr3 dimms lodz so those are
supporting dual channel memory and you
can put up to 16 gigs in here so that's
not bad considering the ITX form factor
we've got a 24-pin power as well as a
four pin power for the cpu directly you
can see the CPU vrm circuitry is right
here as well as the CPU fan header and
in the CPU fan header and an additional
fan header we've also got ah sorry we've
got four SATA ports so two of them are
SATA 3 6 gigabit per second and two of
them are stated to three gigabit per
second we've got front USB right here so
that's USB 2 and then we've got our
front panel connectors over here so
everything's all laid out in a pretty
straightforward fashion I would
definitely recommend using an air
cooling solution on this board that has
a downdraft cooler so that you make sure
your cooling these vrm components you
can see what Intel's done is they've
actually stood these components up with
metal sinks on them in order to make
sure that they get adequate cooling as
opposed to laying them down directly on
top of the motherboard so that has
allowed them as long as you have decent
airflow around them to adequately cool
the vrm without installing an additional
heatsink on it so here we've got the
chipset heatsink and then on the back we
see the i/o this is a server board so
it's pretty basic we've got four USB to
parts two gigabit ethernet ports and one
DVI port remember this chip does have
onboard video HD 2000 graphics so you're
not going to need well yeah that's
pretty much it so that'll power the DVI
port so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the Intel S 1200 KP server
motherboard the ITX server motherboard
and actually be looking at using this in
an upcoming NCIX tech tips we're going
to have a look at Windows Home Server
with a fractal design define our sorry
not define array case so that
supports up to six hard drives which
means we're going to need a storage
controller to go with it and we'll be
using the Xeon e3 1260 l in addition to
that in order to power it don't forget
