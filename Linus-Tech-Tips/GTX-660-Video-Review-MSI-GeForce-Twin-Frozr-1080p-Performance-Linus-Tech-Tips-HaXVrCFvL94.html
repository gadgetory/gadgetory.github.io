card launch video so this one is for the
geforce gtx 660 from nvidia we're going
to be featuring the msi Twin Frozr
scheme this is a 2 gig card and it has
as you can clearly see their twin frozer
3 cooler so the Twin Frozr 3 cooler has
all of the features of a twin froze or
four except for one so I'm going to show
you guys it's got dual fans of course it
has a super pipe thick fat heat pipe
keeps the card nice and cool
it has okay this is don't do this at
home kids okay grounding first of course
propeller blade fans so that that the
shape as well as that coating on the
tips makes it so that it does push more
air it's extremely quiet you can see
we're running a game right now I'm going
to get my okay I was going to have you
move the opposite direction I'm going to
stop talking I want you to move really
close to the card so you can see even
running a game it's like inaudible you
can't even hear the thing but it's
missing the dust removal tech where the
fans counter spin the wrong way and and
remove some dust from the heatsink
before it starts so let's go into some
of the details of the GPU itself so this
is using a GK 106 core okay this is just
the box so there's nothing really that
special here GK 106 core it's a kepler
based GPU so this is a huge improvement
over last generation cards which are
based on the Fermi architecture so
Kepler adds a whole bunch of stuff
besides much better power consumption
and better performance Kepler also adds
support you know well okay the older
cards supported too but innately for
TxAA FXAA so these are additional
anti-aliasing modes with FXAA being
fantastic for lower performance cards
but maintaining a certain level of
visual quality you've also got full
support for adaptive vsync and being a
kepler card you also have on the ti
excuse of the rather not on the tee on
the 660 you've got support for up to
four displays out so if you come back
here and have a look we've got two DVI
ports one HDMI and DisplayPort out which
is going to give you three in Nvidia
guess around plus-one auxilary display
to work with now the 660 only supports
two Asli so if you step up to a 660ti
you have support for 3-way SLI but the
660 because it's not based on the GK 104
but rather based on the GK 106 core only
supports two-way SLI it also has a 192
bit memory bus which is the same as the
gtx 660ti and what that means is nvidia
is using their unique technology in
order to achieve their even memory
amount so that's the two gig memory
amount versus what you'd normally see
with a 192 bit bus which is either 1.5
gigs or 3 gigs so that allows us to hit
kind of a sweet spot and this brings me
to one of the major points before we get
into the performance of the card to much
that I want to make versus its last
generation contemporary the GTX 560 Ti
so these are the more price comparable
cards necessarily than the 660ti to the
560 Ti would be so this is a 1 gig card
you can buy 2 gig ones but the like the
normal one is a 1 gig card and we
observe so check this out so in the 660
is getting around 100 FPS is an ultra
quality and the elderscrolls whatever it
is skyrim around 80 FPS so we're gonna
go ahead we're going to all tap out of
this game and we saw some crazy results
so these results aren't done yet I still
have to do some more testing but check
this out so the 560 Ti to the 660 is as
much as a doubling and performance in
and yeah hold on I'm gonna have to I'm
gonna have to double check these numbers
with the ones that I just ran ok so
that's a little bit different see this
is why I'm rerunning some of the numbers
because they just plain didn't look
right but check this out so 560 TI on is
beaten by more than double by gtx 660
and skyrim so what we're observing here
is that the reason NVIDIA has gone with
that 2 gig frame buffer is that's the
sweet spot right now we're three gigs
would potentially cost too much and not
provide any additional benefit but a 2
gig frame buffer is going to be more
than enough but save you some of the
cost on the card so that you get more
graphics power for cheaper so we
had people suggest actually from our
660ti video review that our 560 TI
results were nerfed in some way but
that's not true at all what you are
seeing is the fact that we are running
on modern settings so Crysis 2 is
running at very high with the high res
texture is enabled Skyrim is running at
the ultra preset with the high res
texture pack Witcher 2 is running a very
high preset with vsync on in Metro 2033
is just a super demanding game in the
first place so it shouldn't surprise us
that much that these are games that at
1080p with high details are running out
of room on that one gig frame buffer so
with all that in mind
stay tuned for performance alright so
here I am in the home studio and I
finished all the benchmarking that needs
to be done for this card so we've you
know I think I already covered enough
about the technology itself so here is
the test platform and for a change I'm
going to take this PowerPoint
presentation I'm going to put a link
under the video review so you guys can
actually download it and check out the
graphs at your leisure I'm going to make
a habit of doing this in the future guys
so this is all run on a core i7 3930k 4
gigahertz cool back course I reach 100
you can read the rest of the specs
should you so desire so let's go ahead
and switch into play mode first
benchmark is Crysis 2 at 1080p at very
high settings so something you guys are
going to notice again these 560 Ti
results they are terrible so we did not
see very good results with the 560 Ti at
all 660ti absolutely rocks it so by
about double the performance and really
hangs with its bigger brother the 660ti
RSA 6 a CIT 660 hangs with its big
brother the 660ti in the 670 which we're
both very close I think we get CPU
limited once we hit around 95 fps in
this particular game the 660 computes
very well against its direct competition
the 7870 so you see it pretty much a
neck-and-neck race here guys
and our next benchmark is a battlefield
3 so here we see the GTI
660 performs pretty much again in line
with the 7870 edging it out by about you
know four percent which is outside the
margin of error so we're going to go
ahead and call it a victory but again
legs behind its bigger brothers which is
to be expected next benchmark Skyrim
Skyrim was a bit of a little bit of a
mess overall just due to the fact that
we become very CPU limited once we hit
around that 100 FPS mark so it's really
hard for any of these cards to pull away
from each other however this is still a
convincing victory for the 660 but it
again loses to its bigger brother and
this looked like a bit of an anomaly so
not sure what to make of that
but don't mind it witcher 2 once again
we see the same pattern where these two
cards are very competitive with each
other however we're going to call that a
win for the 7870 and the 660 legs behind
the 660ti and thus a 70 which is to be
expected because it's cheaper
finally metro 2033 see this is the one
they're all supposed to be aligned like
this so that you can easily compare
which cards perform in line with which
other cards so here we had these two
cards performed very similarly it looks
like almost like a memory bandwidth
bottleneck because you can see the 670
really pulls away and it doesn't have
that 192 memory bus like these two cards
both have and they both perform very
similarly to the 7870 in this context so
