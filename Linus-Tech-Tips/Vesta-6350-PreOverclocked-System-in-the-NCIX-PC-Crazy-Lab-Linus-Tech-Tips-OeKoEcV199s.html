crazy Russians crazy laboratory is going
to be for one of our craziest systems
yet this is the Vesta 6350 OC and you
guys have actually seen the system
already before in the 2012 PC lineup as
well as if you were looking very closely
in the new Vancouver store preview that
where I showed you our cool NCIX pc
setup however we wanted to do a
dedicated video that's sort of about
this system but it's also about our pre
overclocked systems in general so for
this one ok let's go through that let's
go through the overall specs really
quickly here so it has a 2600 k it's
ghajini zeus eighth-inning Zeus na Zeus
like like the thunder god asus p8z68-v
pro gen 3 so that is PCI Express gen3
ready assuming you put in a different
CPU later but the point is just to say
suits motherboard it's good for
overclocking all that good stuff we've
got an H 84 liquid cooling we've got 16
gigs of course their vengeance memory as
well as a Corsair 750 watt power supply
so it's kind of a best of the best
premium brands machine but stability is
very very important so it is pre
overclocked to 4 gigahertz but with the
m4 SSD m4s or renowned for stability the
assist motherboard the corsair power
supply and our validation process we are
still comfortable taking this
overclocked system and giving it a full
one year warranty so we've had a lot of
customers ask us well you know why don't
you just do pre overclocking on all the
systems and the reason is because we
lock down the components to something we
know is stable changing something as
simple as the SSD maybe it doesn't like
that particular controller maybe it
doesn't like that particular board
changing the RAM changing the cooler can
cause what is a validated and tested
overclock so you can see the lab here
we've got all of this running for a
minimum of 48 hours before we consider
something validated and then we take
that as a worst-case scenario so we do
try a couple of different
to make sure that we're not going to run
into any difficulties changing one
component can cause a validated
overclock to be completely unstable so
that is something that we try to be very
aware of and due to the are based on the
non-existent RMA rates on our pre
overclocked systems i would say that
we're achieving that so if you guys are
wondering why we only do a few pre
overclocked systems that is why we need
to make sure that they're going to be as
stable in the field as they are in our
lab and vice versa also what's the point
huh the Russian wrote this so I have to
I have to read it up this is on my
little scripting thing here okay so at
him besides what's the point of having
more FPS is your system crashes cat
crisis during an intense moment and you
end up letting your team down crazy
Russian learn the hard way years ago at
a counter-strike tournament it's no long
day man come on ah so anyway where was I
going with that ah the case is the 600d
special edition white and then the video
card for this particular system you can
choose either a 69 70 or gtx 570 and
it's actually in episode this is our
most recent flyer that if you live in
BCR ontario you might have even gotten i
think it looks it looks baller think it
looks fly yeah there i know because if
you're crazy you think you can fly know
if you're cool you would know it means
oh alright well thank you for checking
out our a little more look at the this
particular pc and the crazy laboratory
don't forget to subscribe for more
videos about pcs and components and all
that good stuff just like this 1000 and
the Russian wants to show us okay okay
okay so here no that's not the right one
is it you're gonna turn and rip it off
so we can see this is a little trick
detection no it's more staying in the
system okay something you go yes
something I've actually learned from
wine tomorrow and 6pc Facebook regulars
very dilated and running it only 60
degrees with the h80 cooler strapped
onto the back</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
