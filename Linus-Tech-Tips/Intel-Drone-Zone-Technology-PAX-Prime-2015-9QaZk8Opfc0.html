whatever it is they're calling this
thing it's a little side room here at
the exhibit next to the gaming Center
out there and they've got a bunch of
really cool stuff going on here you
might be asking yourselves well hold on
a second I mean doesn't tell even like
make processors for druffle ah maybe not
directly at least yet but they've
certainly got a heavy investment in the
technology I mean both directly like
with money like the 60 million that they
just announced that they put into unique
which is a drone manufacturer as well as
indirectly so here's an example this
right here is a it's bolted down oh no
it's just stuck to it yeah this is a DJI
inspire 1 and one of the things you
might need you know oh I don't know a
pretty powerful processor for is the
built-in camera here so that's on a
three axis gimbal it's also got three
motors so you can actually control that
with a controller right there you can
see in our lovely vanna's hands there
we've got the application running on an
intel-based tablet this gives us a high
quality low latency video feed from
kilometers away potentially thanks to
some of the very advanced wireless
technology that is being used for those
video feeds I mean yes the consumer
grade stuff might use Wi-Fi but that is
that is not not the only thing out there
and Intel's also got some cool stuff
coming with Edison built into drones to
make them so Edison
Edison built into drones that we don't
know much about right now but who knows
what's coming in the future but that's
not the real reason I'm here no the
reason I'm here is to get a chance to
win a core i7 processor what is this a
59 60 X really they're giving these away
just like that hey all right well at any
rate what you have to do is navigate one
of these little micro quadcopter bad
boys this is a protocol something
whatever it doesn't matter so the point
is I'm going to try and navigate this
through three sequentially more
difficult obstacles and try and do it as
quickly as possible so here we go
where's that can
troller at yes all right wish me luck
here guys this uh didn't go that well
last time that's okay come on we got
this we got this oh yeah looking good
looking good
yeah looking good okay all right let's
turn it to the left to the NASCAR style
oh oh turn it to the right whoa okay and
then what I can go through it at any
angle any angle all right oh yes
is that a successful run or do you have
to land oh you have to land okay Oh
second dragon no no no no do-over
do-over I got this I got this okay this
is not as smoothly run hold on I'm still
alive I'm still like okay come on third
time's a charm there times it thank you
okay I just got to go for gold here
there we go all right all right where's
my ring where's my ring where's my ring
at okay and then I just gotta come back
come back in the box
are you kidding me absolute of a box
come on link up yes oh she's spinning
our own she's spinning on her own hold
on I'll just cop it okay well obviously
it wasn't me who fell short here so I
think that counts there
all right so thanks for checking out our
look at the drone zone here at PAX Prime
2015 don't miss any of our videos here
at the show they're all gonna be like
wicked awesome subscribe lens tech tips
all that good stuff
and I will see you guys on another video
because you subscribed right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
