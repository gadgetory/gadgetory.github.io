unboxing of the msi a 75 m8 g 55 this is
part of their military class to standard
of motherboards so this although it is a
micro ATX board is not a low-end board
in terms of a build quality or the
features ok let's see what kind of
badges they've got here on the front of
it so it's Windows 7 ready good AMD
vision ok aim D recommended USB 3 SATA 3
6 gigabit per second and they've got a
really shiny certified military standard
stamp on here that actually looks looks
really cool ok let's go on look on the
back
what do we have here some more about
military class so we've got highly
conductive out that guys highly
conductive polymerized capacitors with
tantalum cores up to 8 times longer
lifetime we've got super ferrite chokes
with up to 30% higher current capacity
and all solid caps giving you 10 plus
years of ultra long lifetime next we've
got the msi control center which allows
you to monitor and tune your computer
system click BIOS which means it is UEFI
that means you can use the mouse in the
BIOS and I charger so you can charge
your iPad or iPhone or mobile at high
speed yes you can charge your iPad off
of the USB ports on this motherboard
although only certain ones em flash
allows you to easily flash your BIOS and
USB safeguard allows you to that's
interesting so dual current protection
allows you to protect your USB chipset
from static damage which can happen on
some cases if the the ports aren't
properly configured this is interesting
okay what do we got here so in terms of
package we have an i/o plate this is a
PCI backplate with USB 3 so if you don't
have front USB 3 well least you can have
a couple more ports to the back we've
got to say 2 3 6 gigabit per second
cables remember these are the same as
SATA 2 3 gigabit per second cables
except they have white tips so there's a
both straight to right angle we have a
molex to SATA power adapter we have an
i/o shield that is helpfully color-coded
we have a military class quick
installation guide showing you how to
install your APU how to install your
memory all that good stuff
here we go next we have drivers and
utilities download the latest from MSI
we have their M connector which allows
you to easily plug in your front panel
switches as well as your front USB to
talk quality and stability this is your
user guide so that's basically the quick
user guide in a book form with some
other stuff now on to the board itself
this is an FM 1 socket board so what
that means is that it is not compatible
with phenols and Athlon x' cpus this is
compatible with apu so in this case I
have an AMD a8 series APU that I will be
using with this particular board and
that means that it has both a CPU
component and a GPU component highly
integrated into this socket so let's
look at the overall layout here so we
have our fm1 socket right here we've got
what looks like a perfectly normal AMD
mounting bracket and it is so these are
all the same mounting holes and mounting
clips that we've seen in the past you
can use your old heat sinks no problem
we've got our power delivery as well as
our PWM heatsink here we have a four pin
CPU power connector and it's ideal
location at the top left corner we've
also got for ddr3 dual channel sockets
so you can plug in up to four sticks of
memory running in dual channel we've got
our 24 pin power connector in its ideal
location a four pin pwm system fan
connector 6 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
ports very cool to see that we've got
it's not really a parallel port header
okay there's our front panel connector
so that's your power and hard drive and
reset and all that good stuff
ok we've got our front USB another front
USB front USB 3 off a header this is
great to see so in addition to the 2 USB
3 ports at the back of the board we've
also got two more supplied at the front
or with the piece
see I bracket at the back we've our
front panel audio and then in terms of
slot layout we've got dual PCIe 16x
slots those are both wired for 16x but
if you are going to run crossfire X I
believe they're going to run at 8 X 8 X
we have our PCIe 1x slot as well as a
PCI slot got another fan header here
that's a three pin fan header so we have
two four pin and one three pin fan
headers on this motherboard let's move
around to the back of the board where we
have one two three four USB 2.0 ports
one ps2 u.s. mouse keyboard combo port
we've also got HDMI DVI and VGA out so
of note is the fact that okay two things
this supports dual link DVI so up to
2560 by 1600 resolution and of note is
the fact that on the fm1 socket every
chip that fits in here an APU chip is
going to enable the use of these ports
Gigabit Ethernet two USB 3.0 ports and
7.1 Audio one of the other features that
is highly touted for this platform is
dual graphics which works similar to how
hybrid crossfire used to work but better
so basically you plug in your APU you
plug in a supported GPU and they will
actually have the two graphics cores the
two graphics structures work together
for DirectX 10 and DirectX 11 compatible
games and applications to increase
performance so it's a pretty good value
way to upgrade your APU system if you
just need a little bit more kick so
