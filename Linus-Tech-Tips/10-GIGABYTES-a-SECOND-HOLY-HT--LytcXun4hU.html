few years have been a heck of a ride for
data enthusiasts with high-speed storage
becoming increasingly accessible I mean
something like Samsung's 960 Pro SSD
it's tiny it costs about a third of what
I paid per gigabyte for my first large
boot SSD and it's over an order of a
magnitude faster when it comes to
real-world performance but what some of
you might not know is that networking
has been keeping pace
so these bad boys right here are
Mellanox connect decks for cards and
even though they're already two
generations old they can reach transfer
speeds of 100 gigabit or about 12
gigabytes per second that is fast enough
to download fortnight's install files
yes we went there in literally one
second holy shit
so let's check them out but before that
check out the silent base 601 from be
quiet it delivers a great combination of
maximum silence and usability check it
out at the link below
before we get to the new crazy stuff
let's do a quick refresher on
traditional networking hardware so I've
brought along a couple of examples here
these two cards run it gigabit and ten
gigabit speeds respectively so this guy
right here is about ten times faster
than this one but other than that
they've got a lot in common so they've
both got Intel controllers on board they
both plug into a PCI Express 2.0 slot
and they're both Ethernet so thanks to
their use of inter compatible
communication standards and the
ubiquitous rj45 connector they can talk
to each other directly or through a
network switch like this one I'll be it
only at the speed of the slowest link in
the chain be it on this one gig card or
through this one gig network switch and
honestly either of these especially this
one should be more than enough for the
average person for quite some time but
this isn't average person land which
sounds like the world's most boring
amusement park so we've decided to go
totally overkill and take it to the next
step to greater than ten gigabit speeds
which brings us then back to our connect
X fours so the first difference the
ports this beefy looking thing right
here is what's called a queue SFP+
connector and as you've probably figured
out on your own you can't just plug a
standard network cable into this port
and even if you could well I guess that
brings us to the next difference the
fact that out of the box
these cards are designed to run not on
Ethernet networks but on InfiniBand
networks so even if you could plug it
into your network switch it wouldn't be
able to communicate with it without some
configuration and then finally this
one's actually pretty interesting these
cards yes my friends these network cards
use a full fat piece
see I Express gen3 times 16 connection
that is the same as your graphics card
and they actually need it probably more
so than your GPU if all you're doing is
gaming so then with that in mind we will
not be using just your average gaming
machine for our testing so on one side
of our link
we've got Intel's flagship 18 core
processor with a rampage 6 extreme
motherboard a hundred and twenty eight
gigs of ram yeah and then in the other
corner we have to slum it a little with
a 16 core 79 60 X and an Asus x2 99
deluxe but then with the same amount of
RAM and of course its RGB across the
board now the reason that we're using
the X 2 99 platform with core I nine
processors is that we need to make sure
that we have enough PCI Express Lanes
coming directly off the CPU so 44 should
give us enough for 16 lanes for
networking 16 lanes for our quad nvme
storage devices and then you know some
leftovers for the graphics card so then
for our nvme storage we scraped together
for samsung 960 pros for our first one
and then for corsair MP 500s for the
other with both of them running with
quad SSDs in raid 0 today's video is
about how to go fast not about how to
put on your seat belt
yeah this is like hilarious to me I
never thought I would see the day when
the GPU in a gaming rig is the lowest
priority like tier PCI Express device
sitting at the bottom of the board
anyway for our OS we had to go with
Windows Server 2016 because as much as
we wanted to try out windows 10 pro 4
workstation which is supposed to support
our DMA the tech that allows for these
super high speed transfers it just
didn't seem to be working for us for
some reason
alright now at this point before we go
further I want to give a big shout out
to the guys over at Mellanox for hooking
us up with these hundred gigabit cards
as well as a pair
of 100 gigabit capable passive copper
direct-attached cables wow that just hit
the bench oh so if you want to try this
out at home these cards are actually
available on eBay for like two three
hundred bucks a pop and then you'll pay
about sixty dollars for a three meter
cable like this one it is worth
mentioning though that if you're
planning on running anything further
than five meters you have to use an
active fiber cable which could cost
upwards of twenty-five hundred dollars
new so no all right moving on
configuration then is our last step so
what Jake does that behind me here thank
you Jake let's talk about some of the
technology behind this networking magic
so these cards are designed for use with
two different network fabrics InfiniBand
and Ethernet and what makes InfiniBand
special is that compared to even the
sub-millisecond latency of a typical
Ethernet network InfiniBand networks can
have less than 25 percent as much making
them suitable for use cases like over
network storage access and combining the
processing power of multiple servers
just like in a data center or
supercomputer and this is cool when you
configure InfiniBand correctly it also
forms what's called a lossless Network
meaning that packet loss should
basically never happen for compatibility
though we're going to be using them in
Ethernet mode alongside a technology
called our DMA or remote direct memory
access when you put these together the
set up is called our OCE or our DMA over
converged Ethernet now regular Ethernet
implementations require a lot of hoop
jumping in order to transfer data as any
information sent must be first moved
through the transport protocols driver
then through sockets before it can reach
the applications memory eating up CPU
cycles and increasing latency in the
process however with our DMA the network
adapters are able to access data
directly from application memory
offloading much of the processing from
your CPU onto the actual processor that
sits right on your network adapter so
these are known as
copy transfers and they allow for
incredibly fast transfers that are no
longer limited by CPU processing power
pretty dang snazzy so are we ready to go
we should be each card has an IP and a
50 gigabyte RAM disk so we should be
able to do some pretty quick
windows transfers so are we going
directly from RAM disk around just right
now we've gotta see make sure it's
working first right that would be good I
mean that's supposed to be your job
fingers trust me never the second you
try to do a networking demo like we got
our 40 gigabyte txt file that's 36 or 37
K quit why there's why even it's just a
big file okay oh that's not bad that's
not 10 gig or 800 gig so we've got just
over 2 gigabytes per second so we're
reading from that systems nvme array
okay and then we're dumping to the RAM
disk of the system so that's right doing
the other way so now we can go Ram disk
to Ram disk it's alright no that's the
same thing but to say other way around
whoa-ohh just shy of 4 gigabytes per
second I mean let's put what just
happened there in context that is a 40
we'll just shy a 40 gigabyte file so
like okay doom-doom on PC is like 60
gigs and it takes you know probably for
your internet connection at home like
what an hour to download and install
that just happened in real time okay
what's next
Ram disk Aram disk are you gonna check I
think whatever Ram this isn't working
ok so check this out we've got the RAM
disks working but for now this is just
another quick benchmark so when we
aren't limited by the overhead of
Windows File Explorer in Windows File
transfers if we're just using a straight
disc performance benchmark I want to
show you the kinds of numbers we're
looking at so anyone who's familiar with
a dough is gonna already know that this
is freaking nuts at two kilobyte sizes
we are already seeing speeds in excess
of 100
megabytes per second because we are
actually reading and writing off of the
for Corsair SSD array that's on the
other machine this is stupid
it's pretty cool actually it's really
cool and it's getting stupider as time
goes on we are already hitting 600
megabytes a second writes that's weak at
16 kilobyte stove just wait that's
that's the key and it just keeps getting
crazier we're at 1 gigabyte per second
already 3 doubled 3 gigabytes a second
writes oh wow
oh man we just cracked 4 gigs a second
we just cried 5 gigs a second and this
is on a remote machine this is not a
local array this is over the network
this is a slow test yeah it's a really
fast slow test yeah it takes a little
slow fast test in the billions of bytes
billions of bytes it's like not even
readable anymore at that point no just
like what is going on how do my maths Oh
meanwhile I'll be there just cracked it
10 gigabytes a second
okay so what's our next test to ramdisk
yes sure let's do it
so what's interesting here is that we
actually hit our peak speed earlier but
then we level off to the ramdisk yeah
but our rights are like right so a
better and if we look at CPU usage it
will show in here processor time was
almost zero of the whole time crazy it's
like if you're using traditional
Ethernet without our DMA that would be
like pretty high pegged up there so why
don't we do as fast a windows transfer
as we can we'll go straight to the RAM
disk sure doesn't take long term forty
gigabyte files are like this even on
like a relatively slow the relatively
slow oh two gigabytes a second how will
we ever manage painful yeah so about the
same yeah so the windows thing pretty
much what's going on here is that we
have reached because we've seen faster
transfer speeds in a dough so we have
reached pretty much the limit of what
Windows can handle for the time being
and I don't think it's gonna be in
Microsoft's list of high priorities
anytime soon to figure out how people
can use Windows Explorer to copy files
it faster than about four gigabytes a
second but that's okay because this was
a lot of fun and hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you want to see what this
kind of tech gets used for in the real
world because this is just not not what
it's really for
check out our kind of unboxing of SF use
cedar data center we'll have that linked
in the description because that's this
kind of technology on a whole other
level with with that set I mean even for
someone like us actually it could be
useful maybe we could try to rig up like
a crazy way to improve the
responsiveness of scrubbing in Adobe
Premiere for the editors or something
100 and dig a bit for all the editors
yeah 100 gate well no but we could have
like a hundred gigabit trunk yeah and
then they can gig it's it's bonded ten
gates
Oh like so you know what tell you what
let us know in the comments if you'd
like to see a video on what we can
figure out to do with these in an actual
deployment so thanks for watching guys
if you enjoy our videos on networking
you should probably check out our
sponsor private Internet access VPN
private Internet access hides your true
IP address and allows you to bypass your
restrictions and censorship by making
you appear as though you are connecting
from somewhere else and you can use it
on 5 devices at once it also helps
prevent attacks by blocking unwanted
connections it Auto blocks all traffic
if the VPN disconnects and keeps your
data out of the hands of advertisers and
other activity tracking snoops PII
supports multiple VPN protocols and has
apps for Windows Mac Android iOS Linux
and a Chrome extension and they've got
over 3,000 servers in 28 countries and
they don't log user activities so what
are you waiting for check them out today
at the link below so thanks again for
watching guys if you dislike this video
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link below
probably eBay links I guess while you're
down there you can check out our merch
store which has cool shirts like I don't
know how long this one's gonna last but
it's gonna be up there as of the time of
shooting this pretty soon and I think
it's funny and also we have a link to
