aluminum stand for your smartphone that
even holds tablets up to eight inches
click now to learn more now this
probably isn't what you're expecting to
hear from me right now but let's all
just calm our boobies on the Bose hate
you know by other sound equipment you
haven't felt heard it for a few minutes
and approach the companion fives with an
open mind because while working on my
review I did find some strong points for
this particular speaker setup so we'll
start with accessories physical inputs
all that good stuff the companion fives
come with everything you see here and
everything you need to hook up the two
satellite speakers and powered subwoofer
to your PC Mac or basically anything
else the sub contains the amp and DAC so
you can plug in via USB or with analog
into the puck unit that sits on your
desk the aforementioned weighted control
puck has a great feeling rubberized
volume control wheel and auxiliary input
that I guess I mentioned before and a
headphone pass-through if you want to
use the companion fives to power your
headphones instead of your normally
terrible front panel audio on your PC it
also features a touch responsive mute
that at first I thought was kind of
pointless I was like yeah okay then I
had my music cranked I got a phone call
it was really quick to swat at a
touch-sensitive surface versus fumbling
for a button so okay you got me on that
one Bose
my one complaint about the puck is that
it's not linked to system volume in
spite of the system being capable of USB
input a feature that other speakers in
my roundup have unlike something like
the audio engine a two pluses with an
add-on subwoofer the companion fives do
not run at all without the sub connected
so the number of cables required to set
up this unit is going to be unappealing
to some customers especially when you
compare to some of the other speaker
sets in this series of reviews that I'm
working on but there's no real getting
around this without putting the amp and
DAC in a speaker which would make it
much larger and would make no sense
anyway because you've got a sub box
already aesthetically I think the
companion fives are a bit of a swing and
a miss the black and
anodized aluminum designs from Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins and simple audio and the classic
black audio engine monitors look more
appealing to me but I can't deny the
practicality of the Bose design they're
the only speaker in the roundup that
correctly plays music at my ears instead
of at my chest and that is a pretty
major oversight in my mind for something
that you're going to call a desktop
speaker as opposed to a bookshelf
speaker I mean I guess you can buy
stands for the other stuff so you can
tow them in and then you can put little
stands on them to aim them at your ears
but I mean for something that you're
calling a kit it should probably come
with everything that you need to get
started now when it comes to maximum
volume the companion files deliver an
amazingly full pounding sound that would
be perfect for the occasional house
party when you are not listening to
music at your desk I mean yeah they're
not going to be suitable for an outdoor
venue perhaps but if you want in your
large living room to be loud enough that
no one can comfortably maintain a
conversation while achieving very listen
to a bull sound quality without any
noticeable distortion the companion
fives are going to look pretty good to
you in my more you know quality focused
listening tests I realized that these
speakers are really made for a
particular listener no offense to the
authors but any user reviews claiming
that they have amazing stereo imaging
clear highs strong mid-range performance
and whatever we're written by people who
haven't heard better
end of story the mids in particular get
overshadowed enough that I had a hard
time enjoying male vocalists but for the
folks claiming that this system
absolutely pounds with tight immersive
bass well they could have easily been
sitting in front of their new companion
five speakers enjoying some tunes or
some movies while they wrote the review
because they really really do but
honestly that's not what makes the
companion fives a legitimate contender
for your money they are not the best
unit I've encountered for any kind of
music really they're just alright I mean
they're not even the loudest the audio
engineer five pluses get that award in
this roundup but with the turn of the
knob on the back of the sub they go from
being apartment friendly to delivering
some
pretty fun splosions in your favorite
action flicks general entertainment is
where I'd say this Bo's unit separates
itself from the rest of the crowd in
this roundup due to the included
subwoofer and the fact that it sounds
pretty darn good if you often watch
movies at or near your computer even the
a 5 plus doesn't really compare there's
something about having an actual sub
that is filling the room from the floor
or the corner compared to firing
directly at your face that makes the
experience feel different with that said
I'd recommend putting a knob back when
you're ready to listen to music again I
forgot to do that once and it gave me a
real appreciation for the tuning that
Bose did on this product during the
design process turning base down yields
slightly clearer lyrics but you lose the
the kick that I feel is really the big
selling point of this set given its
included subwoofer and it definitely
makes the set much less fun to listen to
turning up the dial just drowns out
everything else so it seems like bose
knew what was best for you and intended
for the subwoofer dial to sit around the
middle most of the time so the
conclusion here is actually somewhat
simple if you're looking to host the
occasional house party and you want
something that will keep your guests on
the dance floor and you want something
that performs just okay for near-field
music listening but is a lot of fun to
listen to in movies and games movies and
games then whatever you want to think
about Bose products in general the
companion fives are actually a serious
option if movies and action games are
less of a concern for you than house
parties music then the a5 plus from
audio engine should get your $400
instead but to beat the Bose package in
every category you're really going to
have to add a standalone subwoofer to
the a5 pluses something that is more
difficult than just buying a subwoofer
and plugging it into them choosing and
tuning a subwoofer for your setup is not
as simple as just buying the audio
engine s8 and assuming it'll complement
your speaker's perfectly so and it'll be
more expensive of course so while mix
and match can and usually does sound
better overall if you're not willing or
able to put the work into it a package
deal may be a better bet for you anyway
speaking of package deals
here's another deal from our friends at
cheer oh now I know a lot of you don't
use iPhones but hear me out maybe you
know someone who does
and this is a
great thing to suggest for them to buy
are also a great gift idea
Cheerios power case for the iPhone 5 and
5s has a 2300 million power battery in
it and considering it's available for
$38 right now on Amazon it's got some
really cool features number one is that
while you can leave it on all the time
you actually don't have to in addition
to a USB cable and the headphone jack
extender the kit comes with a slim soft
touch case that offers basic protection
for the phone that actually then slips
into the separate battery casing when
you want to use it so when you need more
juice just click the phone in and you're
ready to go the fit and finish of the
unit is surprisingly solid and while it
does add considerable bulk and weight to
the iPhone it contours nicely with my
hand and it's easy to hold one last
point is that aside from what you can
see cheero is actually using a genuine
lightning connector not a knockoff one
this allows the case to act as a
pass-through so both the phone and the
case can charge at the same time off of
a single micro USB port check it out at
the link in the video description I'm
not naming any names but from a peer
capacity to price standpoint it's about
three times better than the leading
brand iPhone battery case guys like and
share this video if you liked it dislike
