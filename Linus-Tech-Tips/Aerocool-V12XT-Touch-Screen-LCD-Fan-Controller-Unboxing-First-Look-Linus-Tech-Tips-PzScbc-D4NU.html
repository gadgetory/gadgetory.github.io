cool v12 XT this is a touch LCD fan
controller so you can see right off the
bat it is a dual bay controller and it
sits in two five and a quarter inch base
they have a finger here so and it's
called a touch LCD fan controller so
this is a touchscreen LCD display that
you see on the front and you know what
why don't we just go ahead and work our
way around the box and see if we can
find out some more information so other
languages are on the sides but English
being apparently the most important to
air oh cool oh and look big even started
the package open for me so I can just
rip off the plastic very easily without
a knife effect almost oh you know I was
doing really well there ah yes no night
success okay so let's have a look at the
features on the back so you got a large
LCD screen two by five and a quarter
inch bays which I already covered
innovative touch LCD technology racer
style fan controller design so they've
designed it to look kind of like a
speedometer and then a tachometer which
is kind of cool if you're into that
monitors and control four sets of
temperature and fan speeds individually
the LCD backlight can be either on or
off you can switch between Celsius and
Fahrenheit I've actually seen this
feature missing on fan controllers
before and it drives me crazy because
everyone sets it to Fahrenheit by
default and in Canada we use Celsius
overheating alarm temperature warning
hard drive working display okay so you
can plug this into your hard drive LED
header on your motherboard lock function
provided to prevent careless miss touch
it's kind of neat okay so why don't we
get this opened up and have a look
inside the first thing we will find is
the unit oh and then okay good there is
some documentation I thought there was
zero documentation inside now it's going
to freak out because then I would have
nothing to talk about except what I
already just talked to them so why don't
we have a look at the documentation
first number one is a user's manual so
this unfolds pretty good here I did
again okay so here English the Fenton
controller is operated by touch LCD
screen okay we've got that much
okay you can browse fans beat select a
fan of your choice from fan 1 to fan 4
to view the fan speed so you just touch
it on the fan speed and then browsing
temperatures you can select a channel of
your choice to view the temperature and
the thermometer display so you can
choose either CPU VGA hard drive or
system and then you'll get a temperature
reading right here a key lock and unlock
so you can unlock or lock it setting a
fan speed okay so you touch to unlock
the LCD touch fan 1 to see the RPM
display and then you touch the digits
inside the pink square I don't see a
pink square huh
okay well you touched the digits inside
the pink square the digits begin to
blink and then you touch plus or minus
to adjust the fan speed at 100 rpm
intervals very cool ok around the other
side and this is a Yuko case it shows
you basically how to change every aspect
of this displays and touch screen and
fan controllers settings ok so here is
how to replace heat sensors for how to
install the heat sensors I guess so you
split the cables and then run them to
wherever you want them to go so you can
see they've got the little temperature
sensors here and then you unplug the
failed thank you Oh replacing a fan
cable there showing you how to replace
failed cables that can't happen that
often
ok so why don't you have a look at the
accessories that are included right off
of that here and ok everything seems to
be mostly pre attached to the unit but
why don't we have a look at what's in
this bag matters so the first thing we
have are little adhesive strips ok the
next thing we have are what appear to be
some extension cables so we have two fan
extension cables here ok and then we
have two temperature sensors so these
seem to be replacements yeah so they've
included instructions and replacements
just in case the fan cables or
temperature sensors here fail well
that's very helpful of them at any rate
they're covering all of their bases here
then we have eight installation screws
that we can use to install this in two
to five and a quarter inch base and then
we have a look at this guy here so it
uses steel construction on the side so
you know I've seen too many that used
like an aluminum sheet here
that's not thick enough but you can see
this is not going to flex and Bend
because what can happen is while you're
installing it you might need to pinch
them a little bit tight to get it into
the front of the case and then they
don't go they don't go back into place
and it's hard to screw them in from the
side so they've thought of that which is
very helpful and why don't we just
uncoil all the cables that are plugged
into the back of this guy mm well you
can have a look at how long the cables
are for one thing because that's another
big complaint that I've had about fan
controllers in the past is if the cables
aren't long enough to reach something
then it's not very helpful at all is it
okay so oh this is kind of neat okay so
while this fan controller doesn't use
PWM technology it just uses straight DC
to control the fans what they've done is
they've made it so that the 3 pin cable
goes out to a 4 pin compatible cable so
you can either plug a 3 pin fan or a 4
pin fan into this in order to get the
most out of your compatibility for
different fans and I don't know what
this does this is interesting so this is
an RPM sensor that also includes another
ground so you could potentially plug a
fan into here and then you could take
this out and plug it into an RPM sensor
on your motherboard but you've already
got an RPM sensor on the fan controller
so it seems to be all about redundancy
with this thing it's got alarms for if
your fans fail you can plug it into your
motherboard so your motherboard can set
off an alarm if your fan fails this is
all about system safety and temp sensors
so these are oh you know what I never
showed you how long these cables were
today ok so the cables are about this
long that is all ok and then for the
temp sensors these are actually hot
glued in ok but they should come off
fairly easily if you really wanted to do
that so you've got the 4 temp sensors
and then you've got see this red stripe
down at the other end that is the hard
drive LED so not only can you plug this
into the hard drive LED
header on the motherboard then you can
take your case harddrive led and plug it
into this one so they'll both go off
whenever you access your hard drive
redundancy there you go so this thing is
taking functions that you could have
already done and doing them better but
then you also still have the old
functionality that's awesome because I
hate it when you plug in like a front
panel like a new front panel thing and
then what it does is it just makes the
stuff that came with your case dead like
if you plug in like a mega five and a
quarter inch so the full SD card cut me
off in the middle of my rant about how
duplicated functionality on a front
panel thing that you add to your system
might render something else useless like
if you buy something that has an eSATA
port on the front and then you have to
unplug the eSATA port on your case in
order to make that one work is like
pretty stupid but this one make sure
that you don't run into that problem so
I'm actually in the time I've been off
camera plugged in a couple of fans okay
into the back of the unit so I plugged
one in using their extension cable and I
plugged one in directly so you can see
the backlight from around the side and
PCB and you can actually see the front
display so yeah we're monitoring the RPM
of
fan number one right now it's at 1700
and then 2600 rpm and then 1200 rpm I'm
not sure how completely accurate that is
but honestly I don't think it really
matters okay I think it's unlocked right
now and I think I can adjust it I don't
know I didn't read the instructions very
carefully on how to adjust the fan speed
but one thing I did notice is that if
you unplug it oh there's an alarm there
you go there's your alarm anyway thank
you for checking out my unboxing today
of the v12 xt fan controller from air
cool air oh cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
