welcome to the Coolermaster booth we're
gonna start with cases here this right
here is the elite 130 which as you might
have noticed is about ten more than an
Elite 120 but actually doesn't have the
beard to have changed in size much
extremely efficient use of space is the
name of the game with these elite MITx
cases oh I put my finger in a fan thank
you very much my lovely assistant will
help me take the front bezel off so you
might have noticed the key difference
here is that the front where we have
this 120 millimeter cooling fan is now
completely open in terms of ventilation
this is going to give you better cooling
on the inside of the case also check
this out fan rad fan hard drive you can
fit all of those in there basically
going to be right up next to each other
so the idea is that in addition to
mounting SSDs up here are five and a
quarter inch here you can also mount
SSDs I believe there was another spot
show me where they are yes under the
five and a quarter inch base so you have
a ton of options in terms of drives you
the idea is you should be liquid cooling
your CPU your power supply is going to
have a bottom 120 millimeter exhaust fan
that takes the air away from the CPU
socket and takes it out of the case your
graphics card and you can see they've
got a Radeon 7990 in here just to prove
a point just because we can the sides of
the case have ventilation holes so it's
going to be able to suck fresh air
directly from the inside it should be
noted that it would be optimal to have a
blower design graphics card but with the
way that graphics cards are outputting
heat these days with these dual GPU
designs it's not always possible this
right here is the cosmos se or cosmos
mini or whatever you want to call it
there's not really that much mini about
it so maybe that's why they decided to
call it the SE it's still pretty big
that's dual GTX 780 SR Titan yeah that
looks like 780 s in there and not only
that but check this out single 120
millimeter liquid cooler okay yawn
everything's got that dual 120
millimeter radiator up in the top yon
sort of everyone's got that triple 120
millimeter liquid cooling radiator in
the front okay now you see now you got
my attention how about all of those at
once as well as retaining support for
Italy
one hard drive so many users are doing
this these days where they're pulling
out all the drive cages you can see
they're gone they're throwing in one
hard drive because that's basically all
they need unless they get an as set up
and there are two hidden SSD mounts at
the back it's got those same rigid
carrying handles so you can move this
baby around with you as long as you have
the arm strength which unfortunately I
do not the CM 693 has made some
evolutionary changes versus the last
generation design so number one check
this out there's more room for graphics
cards because some of what would
traditionally be three and a half inch
hard drive cages has been converted to
two and a half inch which isn't to say
that you wouldn't have the option to go
three and a half inch with them so there
are four two and a half inch mounts here
three three and a half inch mounts here
and they've also made a kind of an
interesting change here check this out
you can hide your wallet in there now no
one will see it they'll break into your
house and they'll never find your wallet
the bad news is that if you have a
baller gaming machine like this they're
probably gonna steal your computer so
they get your wallet anyway so so much
for that idea right moving right along
to the silencio 352 this is based on the
same chassis as the end 200 which we've
already done an unboxing of the key
difference here is that it's more
optimized for silence so you've got a
magnetic cover right here that allows
you to close up don't worry the real one
is gonna have stronger magnets it's
gonna allow you to close off that top
panel noise dampen side panels as well
as a fully blocked off front panel this
does prevent a lot of the noise from
reaching the user and then you can see
right here that you can I'll just yeah
whatever we'll just put that there we've
got the noise dampening material here as
well as a removable front fan filter
assembly it's been a while since I've
seen oh no those are 120ml oh good I've
looked at these I was like really you
guys put like ninety-two millimeter fans
on this thing no they didn't awesome
love it
moving right along to the next category
right along to cooling all-in-one
coolers are really evolving at a
phenomenal rate it used to be that you
got a thin radiator you got a 120 mil
radiator and you got no upgrade ability
the ice Burke is completely different
from all of that so you've got a
slightly thicker than the thinnest ones
that are out there 240 ml rad you've got
the upgrade ability to do pretty much
whatever you want now these demos
supposed to have graphics cards on them
because you can ultimately plug in
whichever fittings you feel like but
unfortunately they didn't arrive in time
but what's really cool about this is the
fact that these are designed for ease of
installation with a couple of pretty
cool motherboards so that's the Maximus
6 oh no that's the Maximus five formula
but don't worry the Maximus six is very
similar and this one right here is the
g1 sniper 5 so this is a custom grade
pre done liquid cooler that I personally
think is incredibly cool moving right
along we've got this is neat this is the
Neptune 2 80 / 140 so you can actually
mount either 140 millimeter or 120
millimeter fans to it it's got two full
sets of mounting and because it uses a
slightly thicker than normal radiator as
well as 3/8 inch corrugated tubing
you're gonna get the advantage of
improved air flow more mass means more
cooling so this is definitely a good
thing as well as the advantage of having
this corrugated tubing design that in
spite of the fact that it doesn't have
quite the same Bend radius as some of
the ones that have come into fashion
lately it is extremely good at
preventing evaporation of the cooling
liquid so you don't have to worry about
ever having to top it up now this guy
right here is a prototype this is a
sidon 120 d check that out there's a fan
in the middle with two super slim
radiators on either side and rather than
unlike the MCR stack implementation that
Swift tec tried a couple of years ago
this one it's actually integrated into
one unit where the fan actually slides
in between so you don't have to worry
about any kind of fussy cabling or
tubing or anything like that the one
disadvantages the radiators are running
in serial as opposed to parallel which
might amount to a little bit more flow
restriction but as long as the pumps
designed to handle it we shouldn't be
too worried about it
so this is the Neptune 140 I showed you
the 280 before so basically same idea
140 millimeter radiator nice thick
design and you can mount either a 120
mil or a 140 ml fan to it the high / 103
as well as the gemin 2 mini this one
right over here are both designed for
applications where you might have stuff
in the way for example these riser power
delivery PCBs that asus has started
putting on there MITx boards or high
profile memory
kids such as these HyperX predators from
Kingston last but not least over here
for cooling are the jet flow 120mm fans
they have an extremely linear
performance curve so they perform very
well at almost any rpm and they have a
very wide rpm range at which they can
operate so anywhere from 800 to 2000 rpm
they come with a couple adaptors they
come with some LED lighting effects and
all that kind of cool stuff and it's
pretty hard to go wrong now on to power
supplies so here's a neat little thing
coolermaster showing off now we're gonna
go through some of the components here
and we've got a fluid dynamic bearing
extremely quiet fan from pro Technic to
give you guys some idea there's a very
famous brand that's number one for power
supplies in Germany that uses this fan
and they have a very good reputation for
being extremely silent so it's there you
go there's that high quality components
so there's a custom dc-to-dc module
there's Japanese solid capacitors which
are basically more expensive and better
and developed for military and server
great applications ultra flat modular
cable systems all this is very cool but
what I'd like to really talk about is
what's on these little displays right
here so this is a cooler master power
supply and this is competitor C and the
hint is that it's not competitor cooler
master so it's gonna have to be someone
else who starts with a C now here's a
bit of a lesson about 80 plus 80 plus in
its regular form it's bronze form silver
form gold form and platinum
certification level only accounts for
power supply efficiency at 20 50 and 80
percent load and a hundred percent low
crap I can't remember whatever don't
worry about it it accounts for power
supply efficiency down to 20 percent
load but it doesn't go any lower than
that
so the specification can have power
supplies that meet the specification
above 20 percent load but then drop off
dramatically so what coolermaster has
done with the V 850 here is they have
tuned it for excellent idle power
consumption so you can see here that
with two identical systems started at
the same time idling at the desktop they
are able to achieve idle power
consumption that is up to about they say
once you actually get the desktop going
and open up like YouTube or something
it's about a 20 watt difference
but when you're doing absolutely nothing
it's up to about 79 watt difference
between these two platforms to put that
in perspective a fluorescent bulb is
gonna draw about 13 watts so it's pretty
much like having an extra light on in
your house at all times when you have
your computer running if you don't have
a power supply that's efficient at low
loads especially when you consider that
I mean these are high performance gaming
machines these are core i7s these are
new Haswell platforms
these look like gtx 680 lightnings at
the very least there's some kind of
lightning addition card but even a high
performance computer now is capable of
idling at very low power consumption
numbers and let's face it even if you
have an extreme gaming rig you're not
playing games all the time
so you shouldn't be ignoring your idle
power consumption so this was a really
cool demo in cooler masters booth I
think we're pretty much wrapped up here
