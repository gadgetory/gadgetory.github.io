lot of times a shocking number of times
does running my CPU cooler make it go
faster and the answer to that is always
well it's complicated you know if you do
this business this and this and all
these things then yes it can but in
general no but I realized that I've
never actually tested it so today we're
going to find out does your cpu being
colder make it perform better in any
meaningful way
the coarser HX 1200 I delivers 80 plus
platinum efficiency for quiet efficient
power and corsair link digital for
advanced monitoring and control click
now to learn more so our first test here
is actually fairly real world this is
Cinebench r15 and we are just getting
our our baseline I mean this machine
hasn't been touched since we filmed the
build guide so exactly the way we had it
set up readings you can see it's running
at 5 gigahertz pretty much on the nose
with that benchmark running and then the
way that we're actually going to get
temperature readings is not necessarily
while running benchmarks but rather
using I 264 in order to stress the CPU
or not stress the CPU and then there's a
couple different ways that we're going
to take temperatures so I'll bring this
up right here so you can see right now
okay well that was what CPU load looked
like while we were actually running a
benchmark but now it's falling back down
again so we're going to use this
stability test and then we're going to
use a couple of different programs for
measuring CP temps and the reason for
that is they're both measuring it in
different ways real temp pulls the
temperature off the CPU die which
actually doesn't go below zero so right
now it is below zero and then we're also
going to use a Seuss's AI suite because
this one is pulling CPU temperature off
a sensor that's near the CPU again not
perfect for sub-zero readings but it's
pretty much all we have to go on so I'm
going to go ahead I'm going to start up
our test here because I've already
collected my minus 11 and not applicable
temperatures off Oh fuh off of my
software for temps and we're going to go
ahead and see what they rise to okay so
while we're running fire strike here
I'll go ahead and discuss our
temperature results which are about what
we expected I mean frankly we've tested
this system before and while we are
presenting this as like a range of
values as opposed to a real value as far
as low temperatures are concerned all we
really need to know is much lower than
the other one because we're not trying
to determine how much faster does your
CPU run if you
cool it a lot we're just trying to
determine if it helps at all at all
so yeah let's see how this goes
is she like an ice lady
alright so apparently our firestrike
score is better than 97% of all other
results we actually only have a single
GTX 980 Hall of Fame in this system but
anyway that's pretty much it for the
results that we need in this
configuration so I'm just gonna save
this now we need to reboot the system
and run it at stock speed extreme stock
speed sub-zero benchmarking lettuce tech
champ set so I loaded optimized defaults
there are actually a couple of things I
don't want to change so I do want our
memory at 1866 okay so that's not there
anymore
and we should probably also stay in raid
mode since that's how we're beating now
just for the sake of convenience okay so
we've got our results at stock speed now
you can see that we fell by about 400
points in 3dmark fire strike and now all
that's left is to shut this baby down
we're going to use restart because I
don't want to apply updates in the
middle of benchmarking between runs here
and then we're gonna pull off the phase
change and go ahead and unplug the phase
change and put this stock cooler on
there mmm so sexy okay hold on I get a
power down right now I mean the results
were about what we expected you're going
to see a drop in score and it doesn't
really tell us anything about our
objective today because what we need to
know is how that last number compares
to the one we're about to get with the
stock cooler that's cool we weren't
really getting any any condensation
around there or anything this is floor
it wasn't cool wow it was cool but not
cool in the wrong places how's that
Oh balls this is like I'm gonna take a
bit to remove oh and it's really cold so
it's hard to work with dang it
way to go Edie you can turn the PCO hmm
whoa you can see the presentation just
evaporate instantly well you missed it
but you would have been able to see that
it was cool I'm sorry you couldn't
experience it wow it's still like really
cold to the touch
that's still cold oh no it's warming up
cool well less cool but cool for
different reasons Oh variable process
the dark side of face changed cooling I
know it's her but yeah I just kind of
figured you were propositioning me and I
was okay with that
it made me comfortable okay the pinky
toe is the most sensitive toe I don't
actually know that to be a fact but it
could be in which case that probably
came across even weirder than I meant it
to okay so now this kneaded eraser needs
to come out which does not look like
it's actually going to be that easy so I
put nuts around the bottoms of those
bolts which is why all the kneaded
eraser needs to come off before I can
count any other cooler great mate we're
not gonna worry about our main this
board back to JJ you probably know not
to take an RA from
you i'm trying from the other side just
yep keep misting yeah the problem is
that i also have to hold the nut in
place you know I'll get through ha it
took off the serial number sticker so
much for my army oh no this is going
faster so that's good oh yeah there's a
big chunk I feel like I'm picking my
nose right now
having a lot of success yeah that felt
like a pretty unsatisfying little dick
where you know you left a big chunk
behind that should have been easy to get
but you just it just didn't come with
the rest is the the tensile strength of
the booger wasn't equal to the
attachment force to the wall of the
inside of the nose you say booger yeah
okay two lows hey we're doing pretty
well here actually not too shabby now
all we got to do is not get any kneaded
eraser into the sinking socket and we'll
be fun this could be a real power back
on you know what I'm not going to
appease my idle curiosity and pull the
CPU out because I think there's a good
chance we'll accidentally get some gunk
in the in the socket so instead we're
just going to we're going to go for it
so we'll be back when we're booted up on
the stock cooler the line between
bravery and stupid is one often traveled
media group
if you think that there's not a line
separating the two and instead it's more
of a Venn diagram we just sit in there
we just chill that's where our building
is all right that's a good sign
all those cpu temps are a little high I
guess we got to reapply the thermal loop
those temps look really high still what
is going on here do you think it's
because I don't have the socket hold
down on like what happens when I load it
no I didn't put it on I just look like
cooler about this it should be fine the
creep expect I mean that's definitely
not working right well you know what
we're going for worst-case scenario here
as long as it's stable this will tell us
the difference between Sub Zero and like
80 degrees I guess so yeah let's let's
push forward here we go
JJ has asked me on occasion why do not
like AI suite I don't know things like
this I mean the system is under load
that wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't
under load but these other programs work
when the system's under load I can move
the oh crap I did that thing okay stock
speed phase Cinebench score 700
here we go run ha ha ha papa Dannielynn
I did it I did it in turn and then here
we go 8:17 what that doesn't make any
sense the phase score seems to be bugged
which I should have noticed back when we
ran it because you can see we got 700
versus their stock 4770k that does 822
so it's performing normally now and was
actually okay well we'll have to come
back to this I don't know what we're
gonna do all I can do right now is save
these results so stock speed stock
cooling Cinebench and then I'll run
3dmark since it seems to be running
normally like this is in line with its
4770k score so I'll run 3d mark and then
maybe we will will get o mount the phase
cooler back on there temporarily and me
see if we can get one benchmark out of
it before it condenses and drips all
over the motherboard so I'm just
basically going to put this around here
until the only sort of this is do not do
this at home here we go well there's a
difference between being a professional
and being professional Oh balls
oh I did not want that to happen no
that's a bad thing okay
ah why why can't anything go right right
now well let's use the technique we
should have a counter in the corner of
this video for the things not to do
that's what that is for yeah yeah that
does do that normally all this is bad
this is really bad
those are like sitting next to the pins
if not on
if I just kind of jerk it seems to it
better
what was this video I dare kick I never
recommend mounting a CPU vertically
but if you ever wanted to know how to do
it this is it put your finger through
the socket to hold it into place while
you lower the retention arm there never
do that yeah 3dmark one is actually very
close to what we got with the air cooler
but will rerun both just in case
need a stress ball right now this thing
just shuts down mid benchmark you'll
know it died from the condensation
I don't know probably less than 10% you
need up completely off the top of it and
run run my pretties well this seems like
as good a time as any to mention our
zero product that we sponsored this
video this my friends is the cheer Oh
handy it's a six thousand milliamp hour
battery bank and I'm sure they were
going for you know the convenient
definition of handy as opposed to the
other one it's got kind of a faux
leather finish on it that looks quite
nice it's a boat it's about this big
next to an Intel stock heatsink so that
should give you some idea and one of the
handiest things about it is the fact
that it has an integrated micro B USB
cable so that right there is where you
can plug in whatever it is that you
could possibly want so if you wanted to
plug in some other cable say for example
a lightning connector you could do that
there is a battery level indicator meter
doodad but I can't find the button for
it right at the moment so there you go
there's the LEDs that light up and it
charges that up to two amps with
compatible devices pretty much um I
guess that's really all there is to say
about it other than that you can check
it out at the link below in the video
description on amazon.com and also they
wanted us to call out that they have a
special deal on the power +3 one that we
actually featured in one of our cheero
spots before so they have that on for
$29.99 for a limit of 500 units total
and given a look at that I found it I'm
not sure how given how many of you buy
these hero deals that probably actually
won't last that long
do you just squeeze it here or something
what I do oh you shake it oh that's cool
all right
so back to our results 823 there we go
that is more like it
what the heck happened last time I don't
know whether I'm happy or mad I'm happy
it worked I'm mad it didn't work the
first time and last time 12,000 545 3d
marks and last time what we got with
these was 12 401 so I'm really glad we
reran that now let's have a look at what
we got with stock speed stop cooling hmm
let's put the stock cooler back on and
see if we can take another crack at that
oh I didn't see that no well whatever
you saw it alright so its final
conclusion time and the answer is no
your CPU running cooler does not affect
your performance our hypothesis our
prediction whatever you want to call it
was correct so you actually have to turn
the speed up in order to have it run
faster which makes perfect sense because
can you imagine with the kind of
precision Elend precision 'el precision
engineering that goes into a product
like this if just cooling it down made
like some parts of it like go faster be
completely out of whack it makes no
sense so there you go like the video if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it like it if you enjoyed the crazy high
jinks dislike it if you hate the
irresponsibility of what happened here
today leave a comment if any of all
those things or some combination of them
all and as always don't forget to check
out the link in the video description to
our community the one where you can buy
a cool t-shirt like this one on the one
where you can change your Amazon
bookmarked one with our affiliate code
so whenever you buy cheero battery banks
where did it go
here it is better handy that is such a
funny name for it and they probably
don't even know why or whatever else it
is you buy on Amazon you will get a
small kickback thanks again for watching
it as always don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
