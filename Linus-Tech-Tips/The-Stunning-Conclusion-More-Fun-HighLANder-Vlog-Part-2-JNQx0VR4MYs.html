I do like a supercut sell like people
can say hey guys I'm Linus he always
makes that face when I do that's great I
love it
love that face funny here's something
straight up funny about my altitude
sickness meds sure they're indicated for
altitudes of around 8000 feet going over
9,000 hello my friend stay a while and
listen hello friends how's everybody
else doing do we know okay cool
and we play a game of where's Kyle so
where did you wrong because we thought
he was in the front drew we thought he
was was slick I thought he but
apparently it's not okay yeah they just
figure just going on and on about like
oh man Kyle doing so well and now it's
like where's Kyle by visiting the
bathroom little Agha sees what no Kyle I
know yeah he's probably limit maybe he
was ahead of the front group but he's
just like I'm gonna go yeah he said he
don't like stopping yeah he's probably
already of the summit we should go he
could be behind us but I think that's
that's that's more likely less leaving
behind it set up real quick the hunt for
Kyle thank you stashing you know here's
our here's our straggler group it's been
Kyle is not with them people in the back
thought he was in the front people in
the front thought he was in the back
that was a lot with Kyle actually but
there's only one trail that's the thing
there's not like there's been a bunch of
Forks or anything like that so yeah he
must have just like didn't you know like
lost track was going on and walked off
the trail and no we had his waiver we do
have his weight all right so Nick I'm
not even feeling the sickness so much
hey nice shirt Nick we have lost tile
yeah no no that's what both of us
thought he went up ahead of us and we
haven't seen him since then and we
assumed he was with the front group but
when I got here he's not been with them
at all oh it's funny I wouldn't have
given it any thought
if it hadn't been for Paul because he
has a chin strap on his goofy hat yeah
but uh when he was like uh yeah that's
how I'm not gonna stay on I actually
discovered but there's a drawstring on
the back so I tighten that up and now
I'm gold now was last time you had Chris
pair snow in June um never years ago
yeah we Kazan now the sun's out so you
can see all the nice reflections off the
mountains on the snow he knocks you
cloudy you've accepted on accept the
clouds over there those bastard clouds
are actually rolling our way especially
some over there
they were much further away then their
lot closed for now so we don't get our
stuff together here soon we might have
an issue we're not afraid of them that
kinds bad it's fourteen thousand four
hundred and fifty five feet can I get
that in meters for the Canadians is that
an option
there we go
world's highest elevation land party
guys it just happened - right here
Guinness said ten people participate
over 4000 meters here we are huge thanks
to Corsair and a soos and Intel for
making this whole thing possible so just
a reminder guys this is course there's
all new our GP series of keyboards I got
a K 95 you can notice on some of the
gamers here are gonna add K 70s without
the G keys on the side
not the lowering of altitude was was
good and then right around this corner
dizziness truck and how I can like
really
run our way down but that helicopter is
as far as I can tell heading for the
summit let's see if it curves it into
the left hard to say
someone's getting rescued so if you died
during an event like this where
everything's like being flogged would
you want people to see your death like
would you just straight-up not want them
to see it we should pretend it never
happened
well not but you never died you died but
but that we never filmed it well I mean
I'm sure that is a case-by-case basis
some people would want to see it for
closure other people would would really
not want any part of it so I'm sure nice
words from wall friends and family sure
they'd be welcome too
go Kings it would be amazing if Paul
forgot to lock the car I think he's a
little smarter than that there's been a
your stuff sillier been out here for
like what seven everything I didn't
leave anything in this car there's like
a homeless person in the backseat huh I
knew it was gonna be shredded that
always happens so get him so Jimmy's not
doing too good and neither slick oh
that's quite the recovery there from
barely able to move to beast mode hey
doing we had to help like you know help
him you know good give him a shoulder
and help it live with his bag we all ran
out of water and then we kept going and
going we were all couples exhausted
getting dark and then we're walking
around switchback
lightning hit like right beside us like
I couldn't actually hear for a second
we ran the entire way down like we went
you know from the top of the switchbacks
from there all the way down really far
he was 20 minutes just flat out like
light and just like we were trying to
find a cave or something to hide in
whoever it was just one
before come down and it's 12 hours to
Lord is just over 12 hours of non-stop
Heitmann I'm gonna get a shower and get
in bed and he will see me like a tuple
months what you smell terrible I can
tell in here i 100% sure so we have to
put all the notebooks back now the way
that they were and you know some of them
are some of them are forgive aways stay
tuned for that on both text in the kids
and - Titans channels I guess I'm going
to stack and my channel and then some of
them are going back to issues for demos
so okay I'm the king of the data's okay
so I think that's a minus thing nope
pickleball is a real sport by the way
why did they call it hockey when they
call it puck ball not a ball well why do
we call it soccer hey guys hey guys I'm
on a mountain
