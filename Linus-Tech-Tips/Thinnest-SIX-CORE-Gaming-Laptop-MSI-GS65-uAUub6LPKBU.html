graphics x4 thin light and stealthy six
for fifteen point six inches the screen
size and five because this is the
brand-new fifth generation chassis
design which played on a second the last
model I saw was a GS 63 so did they just
skip gen 4 solely because four is
considered unlucky in some parts of Asia
or is it just that much better honestly
this could go either way
because in my hands right now is the
most important letter Thank You H this
is the first laptop we've seen with a
six core intel core i7 h series mobile
gaming cpu oh crap I meant to take the
letter off and this video is brought to
you by the LTTE store check out are
designed by humans merge store at the
link in the video description
we've got shirts mugs stickers hats and
more
the first thing that stands out about
the GS 65 is how much more premium it
looks than its predecessor the
industrial design has been simplified
the grain finish has been replaced with
a cleaner blasted finish and the red
pinstriping has been swapped out for a
more mature gold but the chassis
redesign is more than cosmetic even
though it's screen is larger than
high-performance compact competitors
like the razor blade and MacBook Pro it
has a surprisingly similar footprint so
how did they pull this off
well first they dramatically shrunk the
bezels the sides are a mere four
millimeters now with the top bezel only
about half the size and the webcam while
it's the same very unexceptional 720p
affair from over a year ago
to its credit it's still positioned
above the screen in its optimal location
so it doesn't look up your nose and it's
also got this nifty Dipti little
hardware button down here that if you
press actually disables it outright on a
hardware level so all of this adds up to
a screen to body ratio of 82% a stat
made only a little bit less impressive
by the obvious way that they patted it
by enlarging this gap back here that you
won't be able to unsee the next thing
they did was to remove the number pad
which is sure to enrage some while
simultaneously bringing jubilation to
those who hate having their hands
off-center while they're trying to type
numpad or no though the new steelseries
keyboard is definitely an improvement
the switches are less mushy the key caps
are a lot wider and the legend is now
transparent to let the now individually
controllable Ardrey back lights shine
through at another shining point for the
GS is its i/o the ports themselves
haven't actually changed that much from
last gen but every USB port runs at ten
gigabit spec now and with HDMI 2.0
Thunderbolt 3 and
mini-displayport you can plug in up to
three 4k 60 Hertz external displays at
once and I mean pretty much whatever
else you could want even the carry
ability is better than last time
the notebook itself does weigh about the
same but the power brick which you do
have to take with you so it matters is
definitely smaller and lighter the
display itself is a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS
panel that's calibrated on the box with
95% coverage of the srgb color gamut so
nothing really stands out here but it
managed surprisingly decent Delta e
values meaning that colors are true to
life and you could definitely use this
machine for some casual photo editing or
graphic design which is great but what
really matters for the capital G gamers
out there is it's 144 Hertz refresh rate
the gaming experience on the GS 65 is
simply put awesome it's compact but this
thing is armed to the teeth for the
latest titles thanks to its gtx 1070
max-q and 8th gen core i7 8750 h
processor the first one of intel's shiny
new premium mobile CPUs that we've seen
in the wild
clocked between 2.2 and 4 point 1
gigahertz boost and it's only set to get
better a little bird told me that
unofficial g-sync support might turn up
later the hardware's in there it's just
a matter of whether or not it gets the
certification and even in professional
workstation tasks like rendering the GS
65 performed as well as much bigger
not to mention pricier laptops from last
gen but many a high performance notebook
around here has been brought to its
knees by our usability tests the GS 65 s
battery life well that's pretty ok for a
gaming notebook though considering its
hybrid graphics I might have asked for
more here and while it's 3 fan 4 heat
pipe cooling design does look set to
handle gaming loads pretty much
effortlessly under extreme CPU loads
like what
you might see rendering out a video we
saw significant thermal throttling with
our CPU cores reaching as high as 90
degrees after 30 minutes so other than
that though sounds pretty good time to
buy right well maybe but with competing
coffee late gauge series machines like
the Dell XPS 95 70 and gigabyte Aero 15x
due for launch any moment now you might
want to hold off at least a couple weeks
to see if those ones are a little bit
less fingerprint prone and flexible like
I do get that MSI needed to keep the
weight down but a little more
reinforcements
like maybe behind the power button here
probably wouldn't have been a
backbreaker with all of that said
there's no denying that the GS 65 is in
all-around solid performer that hits the
sweet spot between performance and sides
I mean it really wasn't that long ago
that normal non G laptops used to be
this size plus it's got insane i/o and
all of that at a price point that is
barely above what last gen is selling
for so you know what high 4ms I mean I
mean five five five MSI good job
speaking of good job you know who does a
good job ting for sponsoring this
episode of Lana's tech tips ting is the
mobile carrier that's focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction first when you call ting
you do not speak to a robot you get put
through directly to a person and you
don't pay extra for the privilege you
pay for only what you use with the
average ting bill coming in at just 23
bucks a month per device and if you're
stuck in a contract and switch to ting
they'll cover 25% of your cancellation
fee up to 75 bucks
they've even got lowered mobile data
rates with data just $10 a gig beyond
the second gig and every single ting
customer will be able to reap the
benefits of that change so head over to
Linus ENCOM and try out their savings
calculator it'll tell you how much
you'll save on ting then when you sign
up at our link which we're gonna have in
the video description you'll also get 25
bucks in service
credit or towards a new device so thanks
for watching guys if this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured in the video
description also linked in the
description is our merch storage has
