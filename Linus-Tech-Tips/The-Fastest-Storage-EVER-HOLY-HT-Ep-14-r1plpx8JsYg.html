mining storage server come on Calvin
if you haven't seen nerd sports yet
check it out all the episodes are
available now for free over at
youtube.com slash channel super fun but
before we begin we are going to need
some supplies first a bare-bones server
from Super Micro the SSG tool to aid our
and our 48 in I guess we'll just roll it
there quad 10 gigabit network card 64
gigs of ram dual $26.99 3 422 core cpu
time for boring inventory reconciliation
oh I cut that in the wrong field granted
I was scanning the wrong barcodes and
time for fun again everybody on board
the insane train what better place to
build this new machine and our shiny new
beer all set all I'll need is a
screwdriver and maybe a table time for
my favorite activity sucking drive oh
this is going to take a while
one key for nvme PCIe SSD each braided
at a theoretical up to 250 with another
zero twenty-five hundred megabytes per
second reads and twelve hundred
megabytes per second right and we are
going to take all these bad boys and
we're going to put them in a gigantic
raid array Oh cut but how on earth do
you run n D and E drives in race the
answer is this very special bare-bones
machine from Super Micro in fact this
box can handle not just 24 but 48 and
D&amp;amp;E drives giving us the capacity to
without changing the model of drives
that we're using have up to about 50
terabytes of solid-state storage in a
single box and did I even mention that
it's all in a 2-u form factor now that
we've got everything we need for
assembly it's time to open the sucker up
peel off the oh so satisfying protective
plastic and take a closer look at the
back our expansion slots a 1000 watt
80-plus titanium power supply with an
extra in case the first one dies and a
couple regular SATA 2 and a half inch
drive bays because you know you're a
badass when all of your drives don't fit
in the front of your case back at the
front you've got 24 nvme slots but this
machine supports 48 where do the other
24 go ah that right there is the secret
of super micros simply double enclosures
a whole additional Bank but how do you
feed 48 PCI Express based drives
here's where the magic happens one of
the three expansion slots that runs off
of the sec
and CPU is occupied by PCIe x16 quad u
dot two cards and there are four native
ports that use a different connector on
the motherboard itself that run off the
first CPU then both of these go to back
planes behind the banks of drives since
we're in here this seems like a good
time to show how the quad 10 gigabit
network card that we showed before goes
in this can be upgraded in the future
though I don't see myself needing
anything like that for a while and we
can throw in our 22 core CPUs and our
relatively pedestrian 64 gigs of DDR 4
Ram I think I'll have to steal some
memory from the server this is replacing
and that's pretty much it for assembly
time to install the drives oh there go
all the drives who didn't see that one
coming
finally done why is every single one of
these attached with four screws anyway
let's take it over to the test bench so
I have all the SSDs plugged into this
card right now which means a theoretical
16 gigabytes per second of total
bandwidth using 16 X PCIe gen3 qua
you'll find out how that theoretically
translates into the real world
oh ok
get some network connections here get
some aw yeah VGA you know what
performance and it has VGA connectivity
got this all set up you think I plug in
servers here every once in a while right
all right let's press the button and
listen for the sweet sound of perform
that's not bad for to you so fast
forward half an hour we have got
everything set up so disk management we
have created a raid zero you go to
Device Manager this dries oh look at
them all obviously we would never run a
raid zero I am still looking into what
will be the best way to configure them
all with a good balance of performance
and redundancy but this video is all
about taking it to the extremes so we're
going to run a dough with a cube depth
of ten on our z drive here and find out
just how fast it can go
whoa now we're talking
that's like 2,800 Meg's per second right
like play-by-play Wow
oh it's over 9000
we did it we cracked ten gigabytes per
second right feeds at 512 K Wow all the
theoretical 16 or 16 or so look at that
over 11 gigabytes per second right over
one gigabyte per second reads for 8
Meg's I can't imagine it getting much
higher than that so there you have it
folks past four to eight megabytes we're
looking at read and write speeds in the
neighborhood of 10 gigabytes per second
with our highest peak at around twelve
point seven coming close to the
theoretical maximum of our PCI Express
x16 link here pretty freakin bananas if
you ask me and we should be able to
easily even once we work from parity or
redundancy into the equation saturate
our four ten gigabit network can
should at the back here once we get all
those bonded together oh hey it's
another blue apron spot and it's a new
year maybe eating healthy and cooking in
more instead of eating out is a
resolution for you blue apron allows you
to create delicious chef designed
recipes at home they deliver all the
ingredients you need right to your
doorstep in exactly the right proportion
so you don't have to go to the grocery
store and you don't have to waste any
food and it's delivered in a
refrigerated box so everything stays
fresh even if you're not at home when
your delivery arrives everything is
sourced from quality suppliers they
offer two different types of plan the
two-person plan and the family plan and
there is no commitment
you can skip or cancel the service
anytime you want all meals can be
prepared in 40 minutes or less so you'll
actually save time compared to going out
if your family is anything like mine and
they're adding new dishes to their menu
every week so try it out and for the
first hundred people you'll get three
free meals using the link in our video
description so thank you guys very much
for tuning into this video if you just
liked it well that's what that button is
there for isn't it but if you liked it
hit that like button get subscribed
maybe check out the link to where to buy
a cool fast SSD maybe just one if you're
not into buying 24 them at Amazon in the
link in the video description also down
there is our merch store in our
community for and and don't forget to
check out our other channels which
you'll find a video of up here I'll see
you guys again next time what can we do
next time
nobody knows then he's going to rip on a
fan haha well it's running hot slop fans
