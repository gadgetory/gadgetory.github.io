fairly complete accessory package
including a fantastic if a little bit
big hard case easily swappable pleather
and the lure ear pads that use a cool
snap on snap off system to locking
detachable Kevlar reinforced cables that
have attractive connectors but are
heavier and stiffer than I'd really like
and finally a quarter inch to
three-and-a-half millimeter adapter Jack
the cooler master glazier 240 L CPU
cooler delivers the convenience of an
all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more the HD 8 DJ's are professional
piece of equipment and the build quality
reflects that the ear cups don't seem to
be made out of anything special but I
suspect the material choice here has
more to do with acoustics then trying to
build the motive leftover space-shuttle
components because we can and everywhere
else they use a combination of high
quality plastics metal and this
wonderful dense dense foam the soft
plastic on the outside of the headband
makes it strong and very flexible with
no danger of cracking and the metal
headband insert comes out into a metal
front and plastic back receptacle that
offers about as much air cup swivel as
you could reasonably need this piece is
joined via a litter that wonderful metal
hinge that locks into any of its four
positions with a very satisfying click
to another metal fronted and plastic
back piece that supports the actual cans
the use of plastic is very sparing and
it feels like it's only there to keep
weight down rather than to save cost
overall A+ for the build quality I would
never even consider tossing them around
casually but that's for fear of
scratching them and reading their
perfection not because I think they'd be
damaged the headband sits at an angle
versus the you know normal up-and-down
orientation relative to the ear cups and
I found myself referring to the inside R
and L markings a few times before I
memorized how they go on but
I did I really appreciated the design
the ear cups have four positions three
for listening with over the year half on
the ear and completely off the ear modes
and I mean I guess this is a DJ feature
or whatever but it's also great for
listening if the baby has woken up as
well and then a final one that allows
the headphones to be folded up and put
away into their case for easy transport
I found all the way on the ear and all
the way off to be more comfortable than
the halfway one because my ear lobes get
sore from the pressure of having it just
kind of sitting halfway onto my ear but
being able to hear some of the music and
some of your surroundings is a trade-off
some people will prefer one other
interesting note is that due to the
unique headband design casually popping
one ear off is not very comfortable and
makes the headband dig into my scalp so
I did find myself actually using the
hinge mechanism more often than not
anyway once you figure out how to get
them on your head comfort is a strong
point of the HD HD J's but the fact that
they use a slightly heavier metal
construction and stronger than average
clamping pressure on your head they're
rated at 6.3 Newton's that means they're
not the sort of headphones that you can
put on and completely forget you're
wearing this clamping pressure though
was a conscious design choice and I'll
talk about it a little bit more during
the listening test portion of the video
now I tried both earcup materials the
pleather as well as the velour and I did
all of my comparative listening test
with the pleather ones but I was
actually surprised to discover that the
velour cuffs did not negatively impact
isolation and bass response nearly as
much as I expected maybe the very dense
foam helps I'm not sure the velour felt
a touch more breathable but again maybe
due to the dense foam it didn't make as
much of a difference there as I thought
either and at the end of the day they're
both comfy and they both have the same
cat belly soft cloth over the drivers
themselves so while I ended up settling
on the pleather cups because I like the
feel of them against my skin either of
them as a solid choice so now for the
listening tests I listen to crappy top
40 music and so do a lot of people and I
do all of my listening tests with a mix
of whatever I'm listening to at the
moment and some older songs that I've
got more experience with I mean
an objective - and an O DAC as my source
with a mixture of flax and high bitrate
mp3 files so with that out of the way
they're so tight now I complain about
bassy sound signature headphones a lot
to the point where regular viewers might
be taken aback by the gushing that is
about to occur about these headphones
with their very base heavy sound
signature but I absolutely love them the
mids are strong detailed and well
controlled but where these headphones
absolutely destroy everything else I own
even my IE 80s is when it comes to bass
sennheiser says they're designed for
precise beat matching by professional
DJs but between the drivers the
construction and that higher than normal
clamping force that gives them a
wonderful seal against your head
honestly I just found them exhilarating
to listen to regardless of my profession
stuff I hadn't really enjoyed in ages
completely came back to life for me i
sat down to do some listening test with
Hybrid Theory and an hour later I hadn't
managed to take the HD aids off my head
to compare them against anything else
low-frequency electronic background
music and bass guitar is so detailed and
easy to listen to and when apologized by
Timbaland came on with I was just
sitting at my computer working I just
had to stop and wait for the song to be
over I mean seriously I felt like I
could feel the beat all the way down the
back of my neck but that isn't to say it
sounds loose and out of control like the
Razer Kraken forged headset which I
included in my comparative testing due
to its price not due to its sound
quality and even when I compared to my
excellent Denon HD six hundreds the HD 8
DJ's had much more punch and much more
clarity in the bass while doing a better
job of maintaining that clarity in the
mids and highs I'll be it at a higher
price now I've seen criticism that they
lack Sparkle a bit which is strength in
the high frequency range but that's
definitely a personal thing Sparkle is a
headphone characteristic that I find
harsh and fatiguing if it's overdone and
I just don't feel like the HD 8 DJ's
need more the mids and especially the
lows are so well controlled that they
don't overpower the slightly subdued
highs and while they don't pierce
through the rest of the music I can
easily hear anything at the high
frequency ranges at reasonable listening
levels speaking of reasonable listening
volume level Sennheiser rates these at a
whopping 115 decibels max but I never
took them anywhere near that high and
you probably shouldn't either unless
you're using a proper external amp you
won't even be able to drive them that
hard due to their 95 ohm impedance
rating but they are still not as hard to
drive as some high-end headphones and
with an iPhone 4 I was able to go louder
than I'm really comfortable with without
going you know completely over the top
with that set a proper headphone amp
does give them a noticeable extra kick
so I would definitely recommend
investing in one if you are picking
these up for music listening ambient
noise isolation is a very strong point
for these headphones the only things
that I have access to that are better
are Brandon's QuietComfort 15 s that
have active noise cancellation honestly
it makes the sound so immersive and
makes it easy to get carried away to
another world where it's just you and
your headphones and I don't know maybe
that's the only complaint I have about
these with my HD 600 s the only other
headphones I own that cost the same as
these are more it's easy to forget that
they're there they're light and
comfortable they don't clamp my head
that much and they sound so open and
natural that my computer could have been
moved to a concert hall though I wasn't
looking where there's music playing
around me and I'm not really wearing
headphones at all the HD 8 DJ's are for
active listening they demand your
undivided attention to the point where
my wife already totally hates them
because I'm in my own world completely
when I'm wearing them all right so it's
time for final thoughts after 10 minutes
of positivity
I'm sorry Sennheiser but the other shoe
had to drop at some point the HD 8 DJ's
are very very expensive the MSRP is $400
u.s. and the cheapest I could find them
was at B&amp;amp;H for 350 after mail-in rebate
that puts them out of the range of what
I would normally be shopping for when it
comes to headphones I get it there
professional piece of equipment and they
are both built and priced as such but I
just I guess I just wish this level of
performance was available at a bit of a
friendlier price point what I will say
about them though is that while the law
of diminishing returns is always present
you know a $1 pair of earbuds offers
infinitely more functionality than
nothing at all while $400 headphones can
never compare that favorably to less
expensive options the HD a DJ's still
offer a noticeable compelling
improvement in performance over 150 $200
and $300 headphones that I listened to
but bottom line are they worth it geez I
don't know I mean are you going to
replace them right away then No
are you going to keep them for five to
ten years actually taking advantage of
the fantastic build quality
if so start saving your pennies because
yeah they're worth it they sound
