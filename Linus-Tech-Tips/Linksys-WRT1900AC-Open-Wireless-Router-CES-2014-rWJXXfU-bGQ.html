brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital linksys is back baby
they got acquired by belkin about nine
months ago and it only took them this
long to say okay look the team that
worked on the original wrt54g and the 54
GL was like okay look we want to go back
to that we want to make that thing but
we want to make it like better and
modern because there's still people
using that thing and it's only
wireless-g for crying out loud it's not
like i mean who even has any wireless g
clients left anymore so this my friends
is the updated one this is the grand
daddy of home wireless routers and to be
clear guys when I say granddaddy I mean
expensive granddaddy it's going to come
in at around three hundred dollars but
it has technology to spare so it's about
a 1.2 gigahertz CPU it has what there's
some enterprise-grade features on it so
to go along with the detachable antennas
yes we've gone away from that whole
cisco linksys integrated antennas for
whatever reason they did that so you
have a detachable antenna so you can put
aftermarket ones on and it also has
antenna diversity which allows them to
auto sense which ones are best in terms
of connectivity and range for a
particular client and use the three that
are going to work best in their labs
they've seen up to thirty percent
improvements now in terms of raw spec
we've got four gigabit ethernet ports
for land and then an additional 14 when
an eSATA port which is a very unique
addition one USB 3 port one USB 2 port a
cooling fan remember there's a 1.2
gigahertz CPU inside and in addition to
all that the bloody things going to
weigh 5 pounds 5 pounds so while it's
expensive it is also going to have that
same team or a lot of the same team that
worked on the original worked on this
and they have made the decision those
same people who make that decision in
the first place to keep things open so
if you don't like the firmware that
linksys is running ok so like you can
use like you know the stock firmware
cloud firmware or you can configure it
manually they don't care anymore or the
level of not caring goes beyond that you
can
saw whatever firmware you want whether
it's you know open wrt or dd-wrt or
tomato or whatever those guys are going
to be fully able to develop for this
router although to be clear i was
expecting this router to be the most
impressive thing in the booth you know
it's going to be like five pounds when
they ship it and it's like got four
antennas on it and stuff but this ended
up being the most impressive thing in
the booth is this is this an homage to
South Park like the episode where they
they go and they turn the internet back
on because it's absolutely fantastic
that's how iconic the wrt54g was is even
in that southpark episode to turn the
entire internet on and off it appeared
to all run off of a single one of those
routers and I hope it's a reference if
it's not then it's still fantastic guys
