the tech in motion London Underground
now okay here I should go back in for a
little bit here and I should say Tech in
motion is I was a little skeptical about
their headsets at first because the
first skew that NCIX carried was like a
super cheap headset it was like 10
dollars I was like oh Tech in motion
makes cheap headsets bad initial
perception however I have since used a
couple of their headsets and been very
impressed with the overall sound quality
especially considering the price so what
they do make is value headsets and they
did have one product that was very very
cheap it was like 10 bucks and it's like
actually uh slicks dad has one and still
uses it because it has a pretty good mic
for Skype but he said you know the
headphones weren't great but what do you
expect for 10 bucks anyway this is an
attempt to move beyond cheap headsets
and cheap headphones and all that kind
of stuff this is their London
Underground they have actually spent a
lot of time and a lot of effort
developing this particular product it is
optimized for baseheads people who want
more base so if you listen to dubstep or
you know hip-hop or any kind of music
that really relies on a lot of deep rich
bass this is what you're looking for so
look at that they've even got an entire
graph of the frequency response of the
headset so all the way down to 20 Hertz
okay from the core of South London
through the fame airwaves of Radio one
dubstep has taken the world by storm the
underground London edition is our homage
to dubstep in its birthplace experienced
every drop wobble and rewind is there
meant to be heard and felt this is the
sound of dubstep and they've got a very
sort of unique overall style to them
let's go ahead and see what else Tekken
motion has to say for themselves
professionally tuned bass drivers
deliver massive sub bass impactful mids
and pristine highs it they use 40
millimeter drivers in this headset
breakaway cable system this is awesome I
saw this on there and I forget what it
was called but I saw this on another one
of their another one of their headsets
very good I'll show you that once we
open it up single side monitor the right
ear cup swings away for DJs and features
like ramesh arrow
pads for supreme comfort without heat
buildup highly adaptive so includes a
wide variety of accessory cables so you
can use it for all kinds of stuff mobile
PC headset gaming voice video voiceover
etc basin better have stereo music
playback come on you shouldn't even have
to put that on the side up to 115
decibels 32 ohm impedance max power
input is 100 milliwatts per channel
you're decoupling deme are a detachable
multi-use cable system audio ok let's
open this baby up and find out what is
inside I'm actually really stoked to
check this out because they've again
they've surprised me before with their
headsets in the past but I gotta go okay
you know there wasn't sure at first I
told you guys this you know wasn't sure
at first but I have I have I've kind of
been won over so there we go breakaway
cable is right here so you can see that
without putting in a fragile connector
like SteelSeries did with the 7h they've
done a breakaway design that uses proper
a three and a half millimeter jack so
that it's not a micro USB that's sort of
the most fragile thing ever there's some
flexibility to the ear cups here so your
head should manage to fit even if your
ears are at kind of a weird angle and
adjustability wise they do this so I'll
show you guys sort of what that amounts
to I don't know that the left and right
ears are labeled looks like they only
really go on one way but that would be
convenient for nubs like me who don't
you know what I'm gonna find that give
me sec guys I figured it out I just
figured it was left and it sort of only
goes on one way like if you put it on
the wrong way then it just feels kind of
kind of bizarre so yeah go ahead put
that on so I want to show you guys the
breakaway cable system so number one
cable this guy right here so this is
just your standard to separation piece
two to separation piece so this is the
one you're going to use if you're just
gonna plug into your phone in your
pocket you can see the length is quite
appropriate for that okay so it's not
too long not too short it's just good
that you know someone actually thought
about this because I like for example
these my S Force have like ridiculous
cable that gets ridiculously tasty its
tangled now I didn't even do anything
with it go away
alright moving right along we've got
ha the microphone 1 so this guy right
here goes here and then you have a mic
so this guy at the other end has seen it
has the 3 Isolators so that means you
can plug in to a either a phone where
you can sort of use it as a headset or
you can plug into this adapter and plug
that whole thing into a PC so you'll
have microphone functionality as well as
volume control for the headphones
themselves and there you go then also
there's this one I'm not quite sure what
this one does but I'm sure it serves
some kind of purpose maybe it's just an
extension cable or maybe it can just go
right into here and you can plug it into
something in your thanks for telling me
I was doing that wrong
so you just he's just trolling me at
this point ok I'm not quite sure what
this one's for but I'm sure it has a
purpose and I'm sure it's in the manual
somewhere comes with a manual which
shows you probably how to plug all the
stuff into all the other stuff and there
you go so now since I have no dubstep on
my phone because I don't listen to that
stuff slick is actually going to do the
evaluation of how these sound because I
don't know this poem password
yeah wow I didn't realize those on
camera but if they're actually really
good base quality's really good and they
really what's your impressions I was
surprised I didn't think it was gonna be
as good it actually was I did like cuz
like you said my dad bought something
when they're kind of copy but there are
10 bucks so it should be Sennheiser 595
s okay with those owner STX for a really
really basis Ong which is only one I've
really tried it with they're really
really good they do pump the bass
they're very loud and it doesn't like
crackle whenever you play a really bass
heavy song like this one I think it's
louder than your voice in the night so
very probably yeah and it stayed
together it played the bass really fine
so that's good can you show us the oh it
says the the ear cup flips away can you
take your configure that feature
okay we'll figure that out we'll be back
in a sec folks so slide show us how it
works
turn to the side there you go
so now you can listen to something in
your left ear while you have a
conversation with that nice old lady on
the bus who's next to you in your right
ear while listening to super bass heavy
music yeah which she'll be able to hear
because there's an open design right uh
it's it leaks I don't necessarily think
it's open but it leaks Thanks well they
can't hear me so you have to do the
other thanks for watching why detective
please subscribe I think that's lazy
like and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
