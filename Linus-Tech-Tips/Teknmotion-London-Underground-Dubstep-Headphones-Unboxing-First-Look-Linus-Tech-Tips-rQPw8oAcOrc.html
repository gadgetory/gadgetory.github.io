the tech in motion london underground
now ok here i should go back and for a
little bit here and i should say tech in
motion is I was a little skeptical about
their headsets at first because the
first sku that NCIX carried was like a
super cheap headset it was like ten
dollars now I was like oh tekken motion
makes cheap headsets bad initial
perception however i have since used a
couple of their headsets and been very
impressed with the overall sound quality
especially considering the price so what
they do make is value headsets and they
did have one product that was very very
cheapest like 10 bucks and it's like
actually uh slicks dad has one and still
uses it because it has a pretty good mic
for skype but he said you know the
headphones weren't great but what do you
expect for John Ponce anyway this is an
attempt to move beyond cheap headsets
and cheap headphones and all that kind
of stuff this is their london
underground they have actually spent a
lot of time and a lot of effort
developing this particular product it is
optimized for bass heads people who want
more bass so if you listen to dubstep or
you know hip-hop or any kind of music
that really relies on a lot of deep rich
bass this is what you're looking for so
look at that they've even got an entire
graph of the frequency response of the
headset so so all the way down to 20
hertz ha ok from the core of south
London through the famed airwaves of
radio 1 dubstep is taking the world by
storm the underground London edition is
our homage to dubstep in its birthplace
experience every drop wobble and rewind
is they're meant to be heard and felt
this is the sound of dubstep and they've
got a very sort of unique overall style
to them let's go ahead and see what else
tech in motion has to say for themselves
professionally tuned based drivers
deliver massive sub bass impactful mids
and pristine highs it they use 40
millimeter drivers in this headset
breakaway cable system this is awesome i
saw this on there and i forget what it
was called but i saw this on another one
of their another one of their headsets
very good i'll show you that once we
open it up single-side monitor the right
earcup swings away for djs and features
like ramesh aerophone
pads for supreme comfort without heat
buildup highly adaptive so includes a
wide variety of accessory cables so you
can use it for all kinds of stuff mobile
pc headset gaming boy video voiceover
etc basin better have stereo music
playback come on you shouldn't even have
to put that on the side up to 115
decibels 30 20 min Beaton's max power
input is 100 milliwatts per channel your
D company Demi are detachable multi-use
cable system on ok ok let's open this
baby up and find out what is inside I'm
actually really stoked to check this out
because they've again they've surprised
me before with their headsets in the
past but I gotta go okay you know cuz it
wasn't sure at first I told you guys
this you know wasn't sure at first but I
have I have five kind of in one over so
there we go breakaway cable is right
here so you can see that without putting
in a fragile connector like steelseries
did with the 7h they've done a breakaway
design that uses proper three-and-a-half
millimeter jack so that it's not a micro
USB that's sort of the most fragile
thing ever there's some flexibility to
the earcups here so your head should
manage to fit even if your ears are at
kind of a weird angle and adjustability
wise they do this so i'll show you guys
sort of what that amounts to I don't
know that the left and right ears are
labeled looks like they only really go
on one way but that would be convenient
for nubs like me who don't you know what
I'm going to find that give me sec guys
I figured it out I just figured it was
left and it sort of only goes on one way
like if you put it on the wrong way then
it just feels kind of kind of bizarre so
yeah go ahead put that on so I want to
show you guys the breakaway cable system
so number one cable this guy right here
so this is just your standard to
separation piece to to separation piece
so this is the one you're going to use
if you're just going to plug into your
phone in your pocket you can see the
length is quite appropriate for that
okay so it's not too long not too short
which is good that you know someone
actually thought about this because I
like for example these my s force have
like ridiculous cable that gets
ridiculously to see its tangled now I
didn't even do anything with it go away
all right moving right along we've gone
I aha the microphone one so this guy
right here goes here and then you have a
mic so this guy at the other end has
seen it has the three Isolators so that
means you can plug in to a either a
phone where you can sort of use it as a
headset or you can plug into this
adapter and plug that whole thing into a
pc so you'll have microphone
functionality as well as volume control
for the headphones themselves and there
you go then also there's this one I'm
not quite sure what this one does but
i'm sure it serves some kind of purpose
maybe it's just an extension cable or
maybe you can just go right into here
and you can plug it into something in
your thanks for telling me i was doing
that wrong so you just taste just
trolling me at this point okay I'm not
quite sure what this one's for but I'm
sure it has a purpose and I'm sure it's
in the manual somewhere comes with a
manual which shows you probably how to
plug all the stuff into all the other
stuff and there you go so now since I
have no dubstep on my phone because I
don't listen to that stuff slick is
actually going to do the evaluation of
how these sound because I don't know
this potent password
yeah wow I didn't realize those on
camera but if they're actually really
good base qualities really good and they
really large because I put the mic to
the add to the other mic so now that one
more time so what's your impressions I
was surprised I didn't think he was
gonna be as good as it actually was he's
uh he had the tech in motion
expectations I did like cuz like he said
my dad bought something when they're
kind of copy but there are ten bucks so
that should be to these so why don't you
give us some context for what I full
genome sennheiser 595 s okay with those
owner STX okay so all things considered
for a really really Basie song which is
only one I've really tried it with
they're really really good they do pump
the base allowed they're very loud and
it doesn't like crackle whenever you
play a really base heavy song like this
one so we can hear you stories you hear
yeah it's loud enough yeah I think it's
louder than your voice in the night so
very probably yeah and it stayed
together it play the bass really fine so
that's good can you show us the oh it
says the the ear cup flips away can you
see if you can figure that feature out I
don't know which one it is
okay we'll figure that out we'll be back
in the set folks so slight show us how
it works turn to the side there you go
so now you can listen to something in
your left ear while you have a
conversation with that nice old lady on
the bus who's next to you and you're
right here while listening to super bass
heavy music yeah which she'll be able to
hear because it's an open design right
uh it's it leaks I don't necessarily
think it's open but it leaks Thanks well
they can't hear me so you have to do the
other thanks for watching my detectives
please subscribe I think that's lazy
