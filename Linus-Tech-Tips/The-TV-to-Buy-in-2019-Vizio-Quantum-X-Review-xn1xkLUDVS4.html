and to them I say why not I mean they're
not the most stylish things ever but
they're convenient reasonably priced and
they even have pretty decent grip from
when I have to walk my trash cans down
my slippery driveway and so it is with
the px 65 physios new flagship P series
quantum X TV for 2019 with a buttload of
premium features for just $2,200 this
might just be the premium 65 inch sandal
of TVs and I absolutely love it
speaking of things I love private
Internet access that's exactly what
you'll get with PIAA a safe and
protected IP and it's got loads of other
features as well check it out at the
link in the video description
don't be deceived by the PX 65s all
plastic chassis tacky industrial design
or bargain feeling buttons because this
puppy has all the features you'd expect
in a flagship display from a Samsung or
Sony and then some out of purported 3000
nits it doesn't just have the highest
peak brightness of any display to reach
our studio it's actually one of the
brightest if not the brightest set on
the market now it's hard for us to
actually measure this because companies
often exaggerate these numbers and our
testing equipment isn't sensitive beyond
1300 nits but what I can tell you guys
is that when it's cranked it is really
bright like to the point where most
people are probably gonna leave it at
the default 50% now the purpose of all
of those lumens of course is HDR and
thankfully the PX 65 is certified for
both HDR 10 and Philby vision so you get
nice bright Peaks when you're looking
into a light or a fire but also dark and
detailed blacks thanks to the PX 65 s
full array local dimming across three
hundred and eighty four zones or
actually four hundred and eighty zones
on the 75 inch model in either case the
zones are just over five inches square
or about this big now that still looks
pretty big but thing is in a
side-by-side comparison with Samsung's
top-of-the-line q9f that first launched
at $3,800 and an LG OLED the PX 65
obviously couldn't reach OLED levels of
black but it did achieve noticeably
lower lows than the more expensive
Samsung and that's really saying a lot
out of the box we did find the active
full arrays default medium setting to be
a little intense
leading to unpleasant halos around white
objects on black backgrounds but turning
it down to low took the edge off quite
nicely
albeit at the expense of some dynamic
range
I'm glad we're at least given the option
though but HDR is about more than just
light and dark you also need a wide
color gamut and like last year vizio is
again offering some of the most of
portable quantum dot displays around for
the uninitiated today's quantum dot
displays use a thin film of particles to
greatly increase color accuracy and
reproduction one thing to note about
quantum dot or any wide color gamut TV
though is that unlike a monitor which
can be used for both content consumption
and for professional work or content
creation TVs are designed only for
content consumption and in particular
have been designed to display content
that meets broadcast standards so while
a color accurate monitor can display a
wide color gamut all the time regardless
of whether you're using Photoshop or
Firefox a TV like this one will only
kick in too wide color gamut mode when
it receives an HDR signal otherwise
it'll use the narrower rec.709 color
space because there is no wide color
gamut SDR content technical reasons for
it aside we really enjoyed our time with
the px 65 and that wasn't just limited
to passive entertainment it happens to
be a great TV for gaming as well because
it retains all the capabilities that
earned its predecessor a spot on display
leg coms best gaming TVs of 2018 list
now in the standard modes the input leg
is actually pretty bad but you can cut
it in half by switching on game low
latency then if you specifically use
HDMI port number five your signal will
bypass all the unnecessary processing
having your input leg yet again now that
sounds wicked at first but there are
some drawbacks
while this port does handle 4k
resolution or even 1080p at a native 120
Hertz refresh rate it is not HDR
compatible so console gamers are gonna
have to choose between minimizing their
input lag and playing games in HDR poop
also if you have more than one console
well you're kind of screwed again
because only hdmi number 5 is low
latency though if you're that into it a
separate hdmi switch is an option so
then should you switch to this TV well
it actually makes a pretty compelling
argument with a calibrated mode out of
the box built in chromecast ultra and
airplay to support for 4k streaming from
your phone
and a motion blur reducing clear action
mode that doesn't impact the screen
brightness as much as other TVs I mean
the px 65 is a bonafide flagship LCD
without an outrageous price tag with not
said it is only a couple hundred dollars
less than an entry-level OLED of the
same size so then if straight-up dark
feeder room movie enjoyment is your bag
I gotta give the nod to the OLED but I
also have to acknowledge that do two O
LEDs issues with image retention and
overall longevity if you're more into
sports watching or gaming this one is
worth a serious look speaking of being
worth a look our sponsor I fix it I fix
it's essential electronics toolkit is
compact so you can go anywhere and fix
almost anything and it includes their
most popular precision bits
it holds the tools in place with
high-density foam so you can throw it
around without any of them falling out
