unboxing of a new SSD from Kingston this
is their ssdnow the plus so we've
already talked about the SSD now v+
series an awful lot in a full install
guide where i showed upgrading my laptop
from a 5400 RPM mobile hard drive to an
SSD now v+ but this one is slightly
different this is their 100 e series of
SSD Navi plus and this one is fully
encrypted so that means your data is
completely protected when it is on this
Drive now what exactly does that mean
well it has 120 bit aes hardware
encryption which means that you're not
fooling around with any kind of software
solution it increases your system and
application performance well that's just
a characteristic of an SSD in general
and it increases reliability so that's
another general SSD abilities let's go
ahead and take this guy out and have a
look this is a 64 gig drive although it
is available in different capacities
depending on your needs sorry I have to
focus what these are nice because
otherwise I could damage my unboxing
fingers of those I mean I would be a
baton boss anything and I'd be in real
trouble ok here we go so oh they're
cleaning up to five times faster than a
standard 5400 RPM hard drive I mean I
would say that's probably conservative
depending on what you're doing because
if you're using a 5400 RPM hard drive I
mean obviously they're targeting this
skew at notebooks for business users who
might not want people having
unauthorized access to their hard drive
but depending what you're doing I mean
an SSD can just blow away a standard
hard drive like if you're doing lots of
little data accesses versus sustained
data transfer so here we go English so
you got some system requirements you
need to SATA interface and power
connector handling precautions be very
careful with it don't you know rub your
feet around on the carpet and touch
touch it try and zap it because that's a
terrible idea set up a tee a security
cat passwords here we go hey check this
out okay so this is how the encryption
work so never lose misplace or forget
your master and or user password never
do that once you enable an 80 a security
password this SSD will be permanently
inaccessible if your password is lost
misplaced or stolen so administrators
and managers we recommend that you set a
master password which cannot be reset if
lost misplaced or stolen therefore
always store the master password and
safe secure location so there you go you
better be careful once you've set this
guy up if you like get hit in the head
really hard and you develop amnesia
you're in real trouble unless someone
else has the master password and they
can bail you out so you've got your
standard mounting holes which are on the
bottom or on the sides for two and a
half inch drives just like that you know
it's actually substantially heavier than
most SSDs that I've encountered in the
past as well you've got a little
warranty void if remove sticker here so
please don't take the drive apart you've
got a standard SATA 2 interface at the
back that means say 22 power as well as
say 22 data along with some jumpers and
that's pretty much it i mean the finish
of the drive is quite nice but what this
really comes down to is who needs this
let's say you're working on you know a
top-secret project for the military or
you're working on something for you know
your company that you don't want to get
into the hands of your competitors you
want to make sure that even if your
laptop is stolen or lost any data that
you have on it cannot be accessed unless
it's being turned on by you this is what
you need because I mean really it's so
easy to break past a windows password or
to just take a drive out throw it in
another system and then access all the
data that there's no security at all
with a regular drive whereas if you have
a hardware encrypted drive you can
actually protect it from anyone who is
trying to steal your data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
