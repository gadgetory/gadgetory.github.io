2013 is powered by western digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys we were walking
through and I checked out the map and
saw that there was a cherry booth anyone
who knows me anyone who watches the live
stream anyone who's on the forum a ton
well know that I'm a huge fan of
mechanical keyboards so just if anyone
was wondering if you're buying it
usually if you're buying a mechanical
keyboard on a general shop today it will
most likely be with cherry switches
behind it a cherry switch is a
mechanical switch I brought my own
keyboard today I didn't want to take
apart there's this is kind of what a
cherry MX switch will look like that
this is currently a blue with an LED on
it not all them will look like that I
just had to show off my own keyboard
sorry I chill out a little bit so yeah
if you're wondering who's behind your
keyboard if you were running a general
mechanical keyboard that has cherry MX
switches it's cherry these are them they
make a ton of different keyboards you
probably haven't heard of them because
they make more business level keyboards
or more embedded systems keyboards but
they're great keyboards and they're
running the same switches that are on
your on your mechanical keyboards
sometimes if you go to say like a hotel
or any POS system you might see an
actually cherry branded keyboard which
is very cool when we were in las vegas
for CES their POS systems had cherry
keyboards that had built in credit card
readers and i geeked out a little bit by
seeing that because I knew that the
teller behind the desk probably didn't
realize what they actually had their
hands on so just if you were interested
in what cherry was and what they did
they make keyboards they also make some
mice and they're just pretty awesome I
know a lot of you were probably
expecting this video and I know I can't
so off to many consumer products but I
wanted to show you who's behind your
keyboard and who cherry actually is
thanks for watching and if you want to
