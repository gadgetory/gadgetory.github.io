are available in a variety of radiator
sizes to perfectly suit your next build
click now to learn more so I figured
what better way to do a video about a
product that no longer exists then to
bring back a format that no longer
really exists welcome to the first retro
unboxing that we have done in probably
about a year today we have a BFG ageia
physx processor card ya dog check this
thing out so game programmers can design
content for the Agena processor where
every object can smash bounce off deform
or shatter any other object this thing's
from like 2007 guys we're talking back
when BFG actually still existed alright
what else what else do they sell this
this frequency a PFG is proud to offer
true lifetime warranty free 24-hour
seven-day-a-week tech support ah good
good luck to me if I was going to try
and go ahead and redeem any of that
stuff right there alright this enables
incredibly realistic game environments
tens of thousands of realistic smart
particles accelerated real-time physical
motion frees up precious in-game CPU
cycles for additional gaming or non
gaming use they've got a list of like
games compatible the problem is that
this was probably pretty much the
complete list of games compatible with
physics at the time so most of the newer
viewers there well I will I go ahead and
open up the box most of the newer
viewers are probably only really
familiar with physics in the context of
Nvidia PhysX where it's a function
that's built into the GPU where it uses
its CUDA processing in order to
accelerate physics calculations whether
it's fluid simulation particles objects
bouncing off of each other or deforming
realistically or whatever else but this
for those of you who aren't familiar
with it is how it actually all got
started Nvidia acquired a gia back in
2008 shortly after there was all this
speculation that a gia was going to
succeed like here if we pop up on the
front of the box here introducing the
action accelerator
physics by gia so this this was how a
gia envisioned this whole thing we'd
have the CPU to be the brain intel AMD
see they helped us out with this they'd
have the graphics processing unit the
eyes Nvidia ATI now AMD and then the
physics processor they wanted this to be
a dedicated device that was going to
exist in every gaming PC to accelerate
physics and you know what they actually
got pretty close I mean Dell even
released a notebook that featured a
dedicated AGM mobile I think it was what
was it the the 100 M or something like
that I have notes because I can hardly
even remember any of this crap so yeah
it was the physics 100 M for laptops and
they even managed to get Delta integrate
that and then months later boom
Nvidia snapped them up supported the
this physics card for a little while and
then eventually moved all that
functionality onto the GPU but let's
take a look at what a physics card would
have looked like it had no IO so just
just a plain blank IO shield not even
any branding on it or anything well well
that might have been nice on the front
we find 128 Meg's of gddr3 memory so
that's going to be based on ddr2
technology we've also got a simple
aluminum heatsink that makes direct
contact with the core held on by simple
push pins that was pretty standard in
those days and then it does need
external power so we've got a 4-pin
molex connector back here that they
actually go ahead and provide a splitter
so that you can reuse this connector for
yet another device actually not a very
smart way to do that the interface get
this guy's is PCI so you that probably
tells you about how much bandwidth
Piccard really needed and then on the
back you can see all the connectors for
that custom processor that was on there
and that's pretty much it oh hold on
better not remove that sticker kids
because if I do my warranty will be
invalid yeah we've better watch out
watch out for that so basically what's
what's changed with physics well okay
Nvidia took it over they took it under
their wing it has has a Gia's goal then
it
of having physics sort of pervasive in
games not yet I think probably the most
discouraging thing to me is if you check
out the Wikipedia list of all the
physics games that are hardware
accelerated because PhysX is actually in
all kinds of games on the PC on even
mobile where it's just using the
technology and then using CPU
acceleration but actual hardware
accelerated physics is is still about as
uncommon today as it was even back in
2008 2009 2010 when it was first getting
off the ground and we haven't really
seen a game that's integrated it very
deeply since well really I mean cell
factor I mean you'll you'll have things
like the Cape sweeping around
realistically or you'll have things like
some really interesting effects in the
borderlands series that aren't enabled
without PhysX but we're really still
waiting for that killer app that comes
along and makes physics an integral part
of the gameplay where you can you can
really you know kill or deter the other
characters with with the physics
movements so it was especially
disappointing actually see to see the
battlefield series move backwards in
that regard with destructible
environments and all that so I think
that's pretty much it thank you for
