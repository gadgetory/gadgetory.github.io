first see the innovations that trickle
down to the mainstream stuff a couple of
years later so there's usually a whole
lot more for me to say about a piece of
high-end gear than a value one but once
in a while it's helpful to come back
down to earth and find out just how much
the value customer gives up compared to
the enthusiast customer so welcome to a
bit of a new style video for me I'm
calling it a micro review about the
motorola moto e 2015 for G variant
of course RHA tigt and h100 i GTX
all-in-one liquid coolers improve both
the appearance and cooling of your PC
click my face or this spot or this spot
how many annotations can he make Nick do
to learn more since this is a micro
video there's no time to waste so let's
get right into it this little guy is an
entry-level smartphone whose killer
feature is right in the name 4G
connectivity but it gets some other
upgrades as well compared to the 2014
model the processor has been boosted to
a Snapdragon 410 Ram hold steady at 1
gigabyte storage gets bumped from 4 to 8
gigs with the same microSD expansion the
battery capacity jumps 20 percent to 20
390 milliamp hours and the screen jumps
from a 540 by 960 pixel 4.3 inch display
to an OK the resolution stayed the same
and it only got bumped to 4 and a half
inches but size ain't the only important
thing here folks the new display is an
IPS panel it's not the best I've seen
and whites have a yellow or even
slightly orange cast and blues are
oversaturated but it's a heck of a lot
better than TN so yay joining that at
the front of the phone is a 640 by 480
selfie cam a speaker that pulls triple
duty as the headset speaker an
unexceptional loudspeaker and a great
little storage net for Pocket lint and
other random crap and that's about it
the buttons are on screen at the back is
the camera for 5 megapixel stills in
720p 30fps video that stunningly doesn't
include an LED flash I mean seriously
how much more with that of cost then
around the edges of the removable
rubbery feeling ring are the micro USB
charging port satisfying feeling volume
and lock buttons and a headphone jack
then you can pull that baby off if you
want to get a different color one or
access the micro SD and SIM slots 3G
version users will actually find to slim
sauce and slim thin slots in here so
let's talk about using this thing the
screen is noticeably non-retina
it's pretty slow Android 5.0 lollipop in
spite of its non bloated basically
vanilla implementation other than some
little stuff like the Handy notification
glance be
true that I love on the droid turbo
cannot save it compared to older
hardware something like an iPhone 4 or
4s non power users might not be bothered
but on occasion I found myself putting
the phone aside to do something else
while I wait for something which is
never a good sign which isn't to say
that the whole experience is terrible
the phone feels really solid and the
ergonomics are mostly good with more
grip on the back being my only real
request 2.4 only gigahertz Wi-Fi is a
bit of a drag but the good news is that
my Bell LTE connection is significantly
faster than my landline which the 2.4
gigahertz connection could saturate
anyway and I have lots of data so
there's that battery life was a really
strong point I was expecting going from
a 4000 milliamp hour phone the droid
turbo to a 2000 ish milliamp hour
battery would bother me but the lower
power Hardware in here allows it to
easily make it through my most demanding
days with plenty of battery to spare
which leads to the micro conclusion of
this micro video the camera is not as
bad as I expected in decent light but
the lack of a flash means that poor
lighting conditions will come often and
while at 20 dollars more than the
original Moto e it doesn't feel quite
like a direct replacement given how much
has improved you're getting a great
value for your extra 20 bucks with the
most notable bits being for me the IPS
display the improved battery life and of
course LTE connectivity the only
decision then to make is whether to
spend a little bit more for the
significantly better Moto G speaking of
significantly better wouldn't it be
better to have an anime site created by
anime fans for anime fans yes I'm
talking about kind of country roll that
sounds delicious but I'm actually
talking about crunchyroll which is also
also delicious they offer the most
current episodes of new shows straight
