we're like hey heck yeah yeah do I know
we have a what will forget Oh later oh
this is good news or bad news like what
it's super exciting well we'll get to
that later on in the show it's in the
show it is in the show but you're not
gonna know what we've got awesome topics
this week we're starting off with Google
forces European Android OEMs to pay a
licensing fee for Google Apps
we've got leaked
oh yes Samsung revealed their mobile
design roadmap which is focused on
burying components under the screen
rather than putting them in notches
thank you
Samsung hooray for being after mynhardt
here because oh man thank you
fantastic discord TOS update revokes
users right to sue as a group as a class
action group and AMD has responded to
Intel's ninth gen benchmarks they are
super thrilled with the original numbers
that were posted by principal
technologies they they love when when
their processors look like two thirds as
fast as someone else's that is not in
fact the case so it's a super warm and
fuzzy press release will talk a little
bit more about that later for now let's
roll that intro sweet Oh
oh crap what just happened oh oh no what
is what why is that there what no this
is for one of our sponsors I don't
understand why it's there is the intro
in there oh oh wow that's not yeah what
did you do Jake I blamed it on that
again
I blame John no I don't want to click it
again that's just yeah
when show time okay one day one day I'm
gonna hire a producer but just for one
day and then I'm gonna be like oh you
know what the show better what it sucks
we liked the problems I'm gonna do the
verbal colors Thank You smartdeploy
Squarespace and savage jerky yeah for
sponsoring today's hot mess yeah um all
right so why don't we jump right into um
oh we're going okay
yeah now let this we you know what James
picks what he thinks are the main topics
but I I don't know I don't know those
sponsors we're not on YouTube we're not
on YouTube what did you even do Jake it
says it says live right right here I
don't I don't understand is it unlisted
is it unlisted that's possible but uh
yes yes it is unlisted okay
we were we were unlisted right list it
on YouTube well that a hundred and nine
people make it here unlisted that's good
really Wow how did that that is
impressive
did you leave your tab open for a week
here this is something I've always kind
of wondered about yeah so you know how
the only thing keeping an unlisted video
or an unlisted imager post or or
whatever it is an unlisted thing private
the only thing keeping it private is
that sort of pseudo random string of
characters after the domain well I think
in crawlers don't pick it up okay
fine but when you upload something
unlisted if anyone were to just
completely typo if they were to typo in
something that happened to exactly
perfectly match what you uploaded they
would be able to access it immediately
yeah and okay try it because here's what
you know what okay I will that just
seems fun you don't even really Joe yeah
interests no we're gonna we're gonna
we're gonna you know what effort we're
gonna do it live if you get anything I
suspect you'll get a public video you
think so okay I don't know though if the
show addresses for public and unlisted
videos are different maybe unlisted
videos have longer ones I think this is
gonna be YouTube chat plays tried
find the unlisted video so here's what
we're gonna do first I need to I need to
double check
YouTube's stupid link shortener here
yeah there we go there we go
so I'm just gonna grab this I know how
many characters it is so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 so it's only 11 characters and
when you think about the sheer number of
videos that get uploaded to YouTube no
numbers right is it no no there is
numbers there's numbers there's numbers
or cheese capital and numbers I like I
like them odds
I like the ranks all right um so here
hold on I don't even know if like my
screen sharing is oh boy oh boy we are
we are having a good day today
yes properties we're gonna deactivate
that bear thing someone collapsed twice
in the new screen turn beautiful
beautiful um alright so guys hit me up
here I need to know I need to know what
we should what we should start typing
you go first apparently also has a what
Oh capital S yes alright YouTube chat
let's go okay YouTube chats really not
on the ball today twitch chat you guys
are next twitch chat yeah okay we got F
I don't know if that was f to pay
respects or if that was just both sides
said F okay we're not putting it we're
not just putting in all F see you guys
oh that's good
lowercase P lowercase P I saw five
germinate someone wants a ye so let's
get that in there what do we got we got
six so far give me give me a couple more
go YouTube side no more apple that's
what you guys are done too many apps
Rios all right we got a - we got a -
over on YouTube from Hunter thank you
you've got a capital A from just
whatever twitch Oh Christopher
e6 okay hold on I think that's it so
let's try it okay did you unavailable so
as that it was that a video at a at one
point in time was it deleted
I don't know and also why is this broken
that's pretty weird
reminds me of that reminds me of that
time long ago when YouTube went down for
an full plane usage shortly an hour and
did it yeah really yeah sweet we had a
rise of sign ups and we had a rise of
viewership it was awesome at YouTube
thank you so much yeah I was actually on
a call with them this week and like the
first thing I said I was like missing a
digit Oh are we apparently someone hold
on people are saying that one two three
four five six we got ten we just failed
we just failed wasn't 11 we could just
try like a seven at the end oh no that's
unavailable - I mean okay so anyway my
point was if someone accidentally found
it they would be able to access it I
don't exactly remember where I was going
with this so it's sort of element at
this point but oh no we were talking
about the stream and then it came up of
whether or not people would be able to
find it oh yeah the link doesn't change
week to week so what I was gonna say was
could there be like a botnet out there
that is that is trying random strings
and then just you could it could be as
simple as screen scraping it to
determine if it's an unlisted video and
then like compiling this database of
videos that people were never intended
to see sure could a hundred of them have
ended up watching The Wine Show before
it's okay that seems less likely but I
don't you actually don't even know how
you navigate to a live stream me neither
but I think I thought you just go to
like their channel page anyway yeah but
when it's unlisted right but then
apparently the link doesn't change so
people had tabs open which seems to be
quite common yes my influence is going
well I still remember when you used to
give me crap about having so many tabs
open now it's like can't leave without
my tabs dude you got my work computer
like partway through the week I just was
maxed out I was trying to figure out
like why pages weren't really loading
properly and stuff I was like what the
heck
open task manager a hundred percent of
physical memory used I was like I only
have browser tabs open
the only thing because it's curl that's
like 17 yeah was wild
alright so speaking of Google and their
infinite wisdom this first at first tech
here this first topic here was supposed
to buy aluminum aluminum mininum tech on
the forum yeah
and the original article here is from
the verge just go ahead and pop that up
Google to start charging Android device
makers a fee for using its apps in
Europe and then Android will still be
free and open source so that's so the
operating system is not the answer
good so they want people to make their
own apps so basically they're changing
the way that they license their suite of
Android apps in Europe leading the
company to charge a licensing fee for
the Play Store and other google apps for
the first time I used for the Play Store
so in the past I actually you know this
is this is something that I wish I had
kind of looked into before the show
because I remember going back like six
seven years ago you could get Android
devices that didn't have the Play Store
like I'd be like weird knockoff ones
remember that's super terrible yeah yeah
that didn't have the Play Store that
stupid thing called Neptune pine nephew
behind that I had to like do a bunch of
crap to it to like force the Play Store
on and then I remember back at NCIX one
of the other product managers brought in
this like I don't remember whatever the
price point was it was like unheard of
at the time like a hundred and fifty
dollar tablet or something stupid like
that and it it didn't have the Play
Store and I like I picked it up and I
kind of went wow I mean at that time I
think it was called the what they call
it market
Android Market anyway um anyway didn't
have it and I kind of had this
realization I was like wow without apps
this is really stupid
doesn't really do anything and you could
install it but I think it might have
involved rooting it or something
ridiculous it's it's a pretty annoying
process anyway it's not very user
friendly it's a dumb process and so that
whole thing kind of went away and I'm
sure twitch chat' YouTube chat is like
flipping out about you know
not knowing exactly his Android Market
or something like that I think you were
pretty pretty accurate on that one
I was on the phone with Google someone
who's this the birdie tea since you were
on the phone with Google finish the
story for once come on I was on the
phone with school the first thing I said
was thank you very much for going down
last week it was hilarious and also a
floatplane
plan for life um okay so so yeah I was
called Android Market Android Market yes
I said Marketplace tonight shouldn't
Hegeman that's okay all right so
basically the changes came in response
to a July ruling by the European
Commission which finds the company five
billion dollars for antitrust violations
and ordered it to stop illegally tying
chrome and search look at the Android
super chance you have got that he's
actually does he know that he's screwing
himself okay I don't even I don't even
think I don't even think I have it I'm
gonna have to open it up over here in
order to show this to you guys cuz I
don't think I have it set so Steve from
gamers Nexus clearly wants his credit
card deactivated by his by his whatever
credit card companies they have in
America and however that works down
there where where it even is the live
stream here I hate I hate this so much
I hate everything I just want the live
down I'm gonna have to type it in you
know what I'm just gonna have to type it
in myself live underscore dashboard cuz
it's not it's not there oh it's under
Bobby Webster you know what I typed it
in myself and I didn't even have to
guess at ten of the characters so I
don't even care right now but here let's
go ahead and screen share here so last
week after the LAN show in my wisdom and
generosity this was all about generosity
yeah especially generosity I went over
to Steve from gamers nexuses livestream
and I was helpfully you know
really you know trying to make sure that
he can keep the lights on over there
yeah because I just I really respect the
content that he makes and you know I
know that the competition with Jay took
a real toll on him you know financially
mentally takes a lot of resources you
got to mind a lot of minerals
emotionally you know and so I was trying
to help his company by contributing via
super chat service to his stream a total
of I think it was about $32 Canadian
dollars yeah and so he apparently is
determined to give it all back so so far
he has contributed to four five six
seven eight nine he has contributed did
he send a ten there was one of those two
there's two so either nine nine or ten
US dollars and if you believed
everything I just said then I have a
bridge to sell you because actually this
was my plan all along
because I knew that he said he was gonna
give it all back but my contributions
are in Canadian dollars and his are in
US dollars I'm effectively making 30%
profit if he gives back all the money he
contributed it's pretty sweet except the
jokes kind of on both of us because I
think YouTube so really we're just
giving YouTube a bunch of money yeah
thank you thank you our YouTube
overlords and of course thank you Steve
we love we love you all we love you all
especially Steve and especially our
youtube overlords um
you know what you know why I bet he
hasn't done it in like five minutes here
I bet his credit card flag to me that's
yeah cuz I so what happened was I was
trying to send him so I sent him a super
chat earlier in the day I think Nick did
it or something just to like mess with
him I don't remember even what the
context was oh right it was during his
overclocking stream really was trying to
beat us because we wanted to make him
call us out I'll give you guys the
background he wanted to make Steve call
us out cuz he acknowledges all his super
chats cuz he's actually a nice streamer
we
you miss so many of them cuz we suck
yeah um and anyway so he was like ah
haha lol guys you know whatever I we
made him read something really stupid I
think so he gave it back and I was like
no this will not stand
I want this contribution to go through
so the idea was I wanted to make it an
awful lot of work for him to refund some
I was sending them a dollar at a time
now the problem is that sending a series
of small transactions really fast and
then a large one is a great way for your
credit card company to think that you
are a user who has stolen that credit
card number and is kind of checking to
make sure it works so yeah before they
make a big purchase and so what happened
was I was sending all these $1 super
chats and then I got held up like an L T
T t-shirt on stream and I want to be
like yo nice shirt and go like all out
so I sent him like a $50 or $100 super
chat or something like that and then
immediately it was like your card was
declined like ah crap so it took me like
10 minutes of like sitting here on the
phone like I really dedicated time to
trolling Steve because that guy oh wow
there's a but that's weird they're not
loading here the super chats aren't
loading on my laptop but they're loading
up here he is still sending them
apparently I was informed that he
intends to send 100 he intends to send
100 there's no way there's no tech deals
are setting super chances chill
everybody just everybody just calm down
relax for a minute here
all right alright so let's go ahead and
jump back into our topic here because I
take I take user feedback to heart and
we should just finish this to finish the
story finish a story for once so the
European Commission fined the company 5
billion for antitrust violations ordered
it to stop illegally tying Chrome and
search ads to Android okay now hold on
okay I will fit
but how is it that Microsoft has somehow
slipped under the radar with the with
edge and I'm not trying to like engage
in what about ISM Han onedrive how is
anything else but seriously what they do
now is so much worse than what they got
fined for before the the of the way that
edge pervasively prompts you to use it
without any way to disable the behavior
like and there's probably a regedit
somewhere or whatever I'm sure there's a
way to disable it but without any
user-friendly way to disable the message
should be illegal and yet we're
concerned about Google so anyway Google
was bundling its search engine and
Chrome apps into the operating system
they also blocked phone makers from
creating devices that run forked version
of Android and it made payments to
certain large manufacturers and mobile
network operators to exclusively bundle
the Google Search app on handsets so
before Google didn't charge for Android
and its apps because of the revenue
brought in through Chrome and search and
for whatever reason our notes doesn't
contain this but also the Play Store
yeah Google takes a cut that's why Epic
Games wants you downloading Fortnight
directly through their site and enabling
the trust third-party yeah side installs
thing because they didn't want to give
what is it like 30% it's a lot like that
like it's a significant portion and when
you're like a multi-billion dollar
business like fortnight
you know 30% a lot of money heck heck of
a lot of money yeah so before they
didn't charge for it but since the pre
installation of Google search and Chrome
together with our other apps helped us
fund the development and free
distribution of Android we will
introduce a new paid licensing agreement
for smartphones and tablets shipped into
the European Economic Area so now in
Europe
Android is free but the Play Store and
many of Google's other apps like Gmail
Google Maps and YouTube will be bundled
together under a paid licensing
agreement Chrome plus Google search can
be added on top of that agreement for
free but it isn't required so
it's not clear yet at this time how much
the fees will be one thing we do know is
this won't be driving costs down for
Europeans who already pay more than
North Americans for the equivalent
devices yeah isn't that like should we
should we do like a dedicated video on
the utterly craptastic pricing of tech
in Europe that would be really cool
because how often do you see it where
for some reason it's remember okay this
is this is a slightly behind-the-scenes
thing but maybe what I wanted to make
that video of like buying technology the
experience of buying technology in
different countries yeah we did one
episode and like Switzerland did we
actually do it yes you I don't I didn't
think we released it yeah oh that wasn't
very well received yeah it's kind of
rushed like but it was a concept rush
but yeah it kind of sucked like the
there was a there was a store that was
really cool I remember that there was a
like I think it was called Media Markt
and it was a really cool store cuz they
have lots of keyboards on display and
all this kind of stuff but everything
was weak and expensive he was rough
brutal and like dealing with different
mods on the forum on the last tech tips
for him that happened to be in Europe or
Australia or New Zealand or like other
areas kind of like that it's always just
wicked how expensive their stuff is for
a long time I thought it was VAT because
I know a lot of prices have that bundled
into the price which is actually really
cool stuff actually costs before you pay
for it yeah Oh plus tax plus tip okay so
home contentiously service fees how much
does lunch cost then yeah who knows and
and yeah North America it's not included
in the prices so sometimes that can
explain the Delta that very often it's
even higher than that yes
and look the crazy thing is like
Canadians whine a lot about how much we
have to pay for stuff and there are
things up here that are more expensive
just because of our G some well not just
because there's Canadian products that
are cheaper in America yeah
they are in Canada partly because of our
large geographical coverage and partly
because of our low population density
and partly because of wide variety of
other reasons but there's lots of things
that are more expensive in Canada but
tech
by-and-large isn't really one of them
like back when back when I was working
at NCIX and Newegg
was on the verge of its launch in Canada
it was really funny because NCIX at that
time had a pretty good reputation for
taking care of customers for the most
part but in some cases it didn't have
the greatest policies it adhered to its
policies but some of them weren't that
customer friendly things like restocking
fees and you know pretty limited RMA
windows for certain categories of
devices all that kind of stuff like if I
was buying something like a monitor even
when I worked at NCIX with my staff
discount I'd still buy it at Best Buy
because that way if I have a dead pixel
I can just return it whereas NCIX had
their like dead pixel policy that you
had to buy on top of the place of the
monitor any-any whoo so a lot of the
disgruntled customers who weren't happy
with NCIX were rejoicing that Newegg was
finally gonna come to Canada and bring
it's amazing pricing to Canada and then
they launched and it was like a giant
wet fart because and Texas pricing was
never that bad yeah the bad pricing at
that time was primarily due to
fluctuations in the u.s. Canadian
exchange rate and the inequality of the
u.s. Canadian exchange rate so and for a
while there Canadians were used to price
parity even if there was a difference in
dollar value so we were used to the idea
where if our VAR dollar was worth less
it would still cost the same amount of
total dollars regardless of yeah here we
go so the last time that the CAD and the
greenback traded at par was July 22nd
2008 wah wah so after that people were
getting frustrated because I think it
got as bad as like 1.4 1.45 CAD to the
US dollar something something stupid
like that and so people were like oh it
must be because you know gouging
Canadian retailers or because
manufacturers charging more to Canada
but actually it was just the the
difference in our policies and so right
so Canadians whine about the pricing up
here but compared to how Europeans get
it I'm really glad to be in Canada
because you'll see a new product launch
and will be like MSRP 599 u.s. dollars
and then based on a 1.3 exchange rate
which is what we're looking at right now
that'll be about 800 dollars Canadian
but then you'll see it be like you know
599 euros and 599 pounds I'm looking at
it going now hold on a minute
now it makes sense that Canadians have a
higher dollar value price to pay because
our dollar is worth only about so four
of ours to three American dollars
there's something along those lines I
think but for Europeans their currency
is worth more so why isn't it $4.99 as
far as I can tell you're me the fat
thing but still there's the VAT thing
yes but as far as I can tell
manufacturers are taking more margin
from European customers and you can make
the argument that from a from like a
sort of relative cost of living and
relative earning power perspective it's
not really costing them any more but I
don't know how does they might be bad
that kind of brutal it's all Gers to it
yeah um everyone's just repeatedly
pointing out the bad thing yeah we've
been saying that since the start of this
conversation so we are aware of that
thank you the value-added tax what is
the value that it adds you feel good
inside dear
wouldn't you be that's the added value
yeah whatever
whenever I get it given to me like that
definitely my insides that feel the best
speaking of my insides feeling last wow
Savage dirt oh that's highly applicable
yeah um oh there's a Moho habanero oh
that's a hot level but not a maximum
level I actually want to try that I'm
gonna have some maple buffalo bacon
first though because I'm just like so
excited right now
a savage jerky they set out with the
goal
of making a delicious snack that's not
bad for you they may make their jerky
without nitrates or preservatives and
they've got 13 different flavors like
their sriracha bacon and maple buffalo
bacon which is my personal favorite and
they also make barbecue sauce which I
actually haven't tried but I really want
to now because they also make hot sauce
which is flippin awesome I've got hot
sauce I took home so so far all I had
put it on was like some pasta
that's normal things that a normal thing
putting hot sauce on like I'm like I
actually don't know but I did it too
so like just a red sauce meat pasta yeah
alright that's gotta be ok it's whatever
it's good that's awesome meat with hot
sauce make sense hadn't had it on a
burger yet oh I still have a net on look
sharp cheddar cheese burger a little bit
of hot sauce on there oh it was so good
what is the one that you go I don't
remember but I'm just gonna like I'm
gonna hold on to the jar and make sure
that I get the same one because I'm I'm
the kind of person that once I find
something I like I don't tend to branch
out much so I'm just doing this chicken
boxes that we no longer have access yeah
but I mean that was something where like
Ike I was kind of forced to try it by
the sponsor spot that we were doing we
were featuring their hot sauce I didn't
want to like talk about how great it is
without having tried it so yeah I need
to try it I was like wow this is good
the Tabasco is is done yes I know
Tabasco is like the world's most boring
hot sauce but it was it was like what I
was used to and I don't I don't
look I don't switch but I switched I
don't regret it anyway they have a trick

okay so it's supposed to be the the
three videos see that that's what I
didn't tell you about the beginning okay
so you click on one we talked about it
till that video ends and you click on
the next one we keep talking occluding
the next one we keep talking neat that's
what's on screen during this book so
this video is brought to you by
smartdeploy smart so I I started now
yeah wow look at that wow this is so
slick and fancy yeah smartdeploy is a
modern computer imaging software that
offers IT control and efficiency through
centralized single image management and
pre-built device driver packages if you
work in IT you might be familiar with
old-school
disk cloning tools because back in the
day you needed a separate image for each
computer model and when you have
thousands of users it can be pretty
tricky to keep a library of ten plus
images up to date that haha there goes
another one is why smartdeploy was
created its hardware independent so it
allows you to deploy just one image to
any computer model so you can download
smart deploy and search their library of
over 1200 platform packs we checked out
the business class models that we have
here at Linus Media Group and they have
a ton they also offer one-click user
data migration for simplified migrations
to Windows 10 and 0 touch network
deployment imaging over the Internet so
you can set it up in and after
so we're giving away 50 and free
licenses oh that's pretty cool with one
year of support to our viewers so that's
six hundred and fifty five bucks worth
of free IT software if you're not 19
then you don't have to take it but you
could send it to your friend and I
t-that would be a good idea so if you
work at a company with 50 to 50 thousand
computers head to smartdeploy comm
forward slash Linus and claim your free
smartdeploy licenses it's kind of neat
like they gave us this whole thing that
I don't think we're gonna make it all
the way through but I think you guys
mostly get the point
oh there's the platform packs surface
book surface book - Wow then oh yes no
surface book - is not the one that's
like very very new that's just the one
that's like pretty new yeah cool all
right
so we should do some topics can you tell
me the exciting thing I'm dying here
that was it well is we had videos for an
ad spot really it became insanely less
exciting when the video played in the
intro and I was like really
yeah I waited how long have we been
broadcast 34 minutes I waited half an
hour for that I only bring the goodness
right okay then
so Samsung's device design roadmap is
out in the wild this is supposed to by
bow buzu on the forum let's go ahead and
pull this up and this is the fancy
display tech that Samsung apparently
wants for its future phones and it
sounds amazing so this is a written
article so there's not really gonna be a
whole lot for me to show you guys there
I want to have fingerprints under the
screen they want to have under screen
sensors including camera they want to
have under panel sensors
vibrations that emanate from the screen
haptics on display instead of like down
on below which should theoretically feel
even nicer and
screen sound technology sound on display
Wow
so let's go through these one at a time
so fingerprint reader under the screen
that's kind of done yeah so vivos got I
think a couple of phones now that have
fingerprint readers under the screen in
fact the rumor is that the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 will have a fingerprint
reader under the screen I'm gonna be so
thrilled because as much as I like iris
scanning and facial recognition and all
that good stuff
III I don't know something about me and
the way I use my phone it sits on my
desk next to me a lot yeah so that's why
I've never really been a huge fan of the
fingerprint sensor on the back and the
way around it has been whether through
face ID for Apple or whether true but
yeah what are you using it for when it's
on your desk like looking at
notifications or like sending a quick
what notifications and what message
wouldn't it be faster to do on your
computer Twitter so okay so Twitter for
example for whatever reason like on the
desktop you can't be logged into two
accounts at the same time unless you
have are used two different browsers are
you using incognito window or whatever
the case may be so on my phone well I
have my multiple Twitter account so I
can if I get a notification from when
I'm not logged in no that's fair alright
so there's our reason yeah so I like it
and the workaround has always been iris
scanning facial scanning of some sort or
just picking the stupid thing up or like
keying in the pin which feels like
dinosaur technology to me at this point
every time I have to do it I'm like
really um so I am amped to hear that
we're gonna be looking at a fingerprint
scanner under the screen hopefully on
the galaxy s 10 this other stuff is
getting even trickier so it looks like
Samsung is so anti not that they would
rather ride it out until they can manage
to put a camera under the screen so if
you have a fingerprint sensor on the
front and you don't need to have like a
fancy you know dot projector array or
anything like that then there would be
no need for the knotch as long as you
can do the camera so if you've got the
fingerprint and you've got the camera
both working through the display
then theoretically we could go
completely full screen for the phone I
think you're distracting me what if what
is going on here
oh it's like a little yeah and that's
without doing things that will that are
neat but we'll obviously compromise the
longevity of the device you know after a
while like I haven't yet seen any real
evidence that the find X and the Nexus
are gonna fail you know that they're
cameras that just come in and out but I
mean with the amount of like I remember
actually this funny story so I ended up
with Nick's iPhone 6 okay for like next
to nothing because he was like yeah it
doesn't charge anymore I was like okay
so I bought it from him and sold him my
6s for like super cheap because honestly
I just wanted it for like I I listen to
music or I listen to TV shows weird when
I sleep so I wanted something anything
with a headphone jack that's got good
app compatibility is fine but it was
like fifty bucks or something stupid
like that so pecky I'll use an iPhone 6
for that okay so I was like yeah sure
you can you can trade in you can trade
in the iPhone 6 for the iPhone 6s and
I'll see if I can fix it so the fix was
a safety pin picking out the pocket
[Laughter]
works pretty well alright womp womp
so anyway right even a very well
designed mechanism one with no moving
parts
I respect the Lightning connector yeah
it is a great connector it was so far
ahead of its time back when Android
phones we're using Gympie micro USB
connectors if that can manage to fail
because of Pocket lint then I think that
a moving you know retracting camera
doodad really doesn't really doesn't
stand a chance like some of them will
die so if we can get the camera and the
fingerprint under the cent under the
panel then we've really unlocked the
possibility of truly full score
phones that won't be unreliable now
vibrations that emanate from the screen
and sound that comes from the screen
we've actually seen that second one
before so not a lot of people watched
this video so I'm guessing a lot of you
missed it
we're were you at CES the year that Sony
showed off their TV that had no speakers
yeah okay did you ever listen to it no
okay so I managed to get like a private
screening in the the back room where
they weren't really showing it to press
but they were showing it to partners and
customers yeah and it was incredible it
sounded great like they did the whole
thing I have you ever been to a Bose
store no yes okay have you ever been in
like the room where I guess this would
have been like a long time ago but I
remember going to a Bose store and they
had this whole demo room set up in the
back with like these fake speakers that
were actually just like little like wire
things with a cloth over them and a
handle on the top so that they looked
like a box but then they could pick them
up and they're just there was nothing
under there and they had they had this
special TV a bunch of like side firing
and upward and downward firing speakers
it wasn't a sound bar this was when they
were they were doing surround somehow
firing it out of the TV in this special
room anyway I had a similar experience
in the Sony booth where they were like
oh you know where do you think the sound
is all coming from ahaha it's just
coming from the display I mean of course
there wasn't much of a big reveal
because the reason I arranged to get
into that back room was that I really
wanted to hear it it was pretty talked
about you already knew where the sound
was coming from but it sounded really
good because if you think about it
fundamentally what makes sound
what are speakers what someone in Schad
said it works great until you crack the
screen why would you crack the screen
how to do that um I just yeah don't
worry about it keep going so remember
this is the same panel technology that
they are literally using to make curved
displays like a little bit of vibrations
not gonna kill it like if you ever I
mean obviously you're not gonna get like
rock and bass out of the thing or
whatever but no it's it sounded good it
was fine it was fine
like when you touch it it's just like
like it's not you can barely make out
the image for all the shaking or
whatever and I've actually wondered for
a while why it is that that technology
hasn't made its way to phones because
it's such an obvious like I'm sure there
are many technological challenges with
taking that technology and shrinking it
into something you can actually hold a
handheld this can be a big problem but
it's such an obvious way to get past
needing that earphone speaker and
needing that that well I guess they'll
still need the wife yeah wonder if you
could I mean you probably couldn't use
it as a microphone as well use what just
the vibrations of your voice on the
screen well probably it wouldn't sound
very good though so we'll probably
always you have a lot of problems with
other noise in the room anyway if and
when all of these techs roll out we
could be looking at a completely bezel
is and maximally brought waterproof
design
unless of course Samsung continues
providing us with headphone jacks when
do you think it's gonna happen when do
you think there is going to not be a
single flagship device on the market
left with a headphone jack I don't think
it'd be too long or there will be one
company that that's just there stick and
they just don't drop it for a long time
who else is left right now I think are
we already there like who other than
Samsung makes a flagship class device
with a headphone jack
yeah but Samsung would totally be one of
those companies that would be like no
this is just how we do it cuz they are
they've been trying so hard for so long
to differentiate mm-hmm like they've
actually been trying really hard for a
while they've been making their own apps
even when people hated them viciously
they did not drop their own apps at any
point because they're like no this is
our stuff and then apparently now
they're a little bit better I haven't
used the Samsung phone in a while I
still won't use them yeah but they're
still trying clearly this still trying
they finally went a very unique
direction in terms of colors they're
really trying to differentiate
themselves they might try to hold on
there I've got people saying oneplus I
don't know if you've seen the rumors
from the oneplus 60 but doesn't look
like it's gonna have a headphone jack
LG maybe so what is this a South Korean
thing then maybe I could see it are why
they do some interesting stuff it like
remember when they had radios radio
antennas and stuff mm-hmm
that was localized but they've they've
always been a little bit different in
terms of their their personalized
technology that's yeah that's really
interesting that because LG also gives
very many apps about the audio quality
of their phones like they go as far as
to put their quality Dax and that's like
a real selling point for them
interesting you know what sucks for me
right now
I was on a first gen pixel and I skipped
pixel 2 because I was like that phone
looks amazing but I don't need it my
phone's still fine it's only a year old
at this point no big deal now we're at
the next generation of phones you better
grab a pixel 2 before they're all gone
and I hate all of them what and like I
feel like it's just just a terrible time
to buy a phone cuz it looks like the
next red will be pretty nice
just with with the like okay these are
all the shortcomings this year they'll
probably take care of it next year kind
of stuff and last gen was pretty good
but this gen is just kind of you know
I've had people um so I released a
fairly unpopular video this week you did
yeah with basically my criticisms of the
iPhone 10s
there are a couple things I got wrong
but by and large I stand by the majority
of the complaints as petty as they might
be like I acknowledged in the video that
they're they're petty
they are very petty complaints I think
people sort of missed that part but
maybe maybe the issue here is anyway so
one of the comments on that video was
that it seemed like I was riding the
note 9 pretty hard and there was no kind
of rational explanation for why I liked
it so much and I was thinking about that
why do I like the note 9 so much because
they trade blows sometimes but by and
large the iPhone 10s does have a better
camera even if it's not in a way that
makes a huge difference to me day to day
and the note 9 has a clear advantage
like in my dimly lit house taking
pictures of fast-moving target
like children that don't hold still like
there's there's reasons that I
personally professor yeah but the iPhone
10s objectively has a better camera so I
was like why do I like the note nine so
much and I think the answer was because
that's exactly what they did they took
the last gen and didn't change anything
other than tweak the couple of things
that were bad and that was okay my
argument here is gonna be a bit in
support of you you release a billion
videos every day release every day on
multiple channels you don't want to
regurgitate yourself a million times if
people wanted to know about the note 9
stuff that you like they would go watch
the no 9 video you don't have to really
every single feeling you have in every
single video there has to be a little
bit of that I will defend the audience
there yeah I think and there maybe could
have been a little bit more in that
video but I don't think you needed an
entire note 9 review in the tennis I
think what people were more off but I
was the tone of the video it came across
really whiny and when I was like was a
little when I was doing music but it was
like blah when I was doing it I even
felt whiny like I wasn't happy making it
and I think that made us that people
weren't happy watching it and you know
there were things that I think he our
longer discussions than just the offhand
mentions that I made of them so things
like the Twitter app and there being
only a handful of pixels that you can
reach because the knotch gets in the way
of switching between profiles you know a
lot of people are like well that's
Twitter's problem and my response to
that is I don't care I'm the user yeah
clearly this this knotch design language
has issues I mean Scott issues on the
pixel 3 Excel as well like look at this
in Google's own stupid apps here's the
here's the stupid studio atom and that
the shade I mean you guys aren't really
gonna be able to see this but like the
stupid shade at the top cuts off one of
the words and affects the readability
and it's like I don't want to be one of
those people who just wins all day about
the design but that's bad design and
it's your own stupid
app how do you expect third parties to
be able to keep up with this nonsense so
so I so anyway there's a follow-up video
coming I don't know if you know this I
didn't so there's a follow-up video
that's gonna be called something along
the lines of ten great reasons you
should buy an iPhone and the idea behind
it is that my personal feelings are out
there I've said what I think but I don't
want our videos to be affected by my
personal feelings so much and I think
that what we effectively did in that
video is we kind of took a crap on the
people who owned iPhones and love them
without giving equal airtime to the
reasons that iPhones are great and to
add some context here again in defense
of you but not in defense of your video
no worries is that we've always had a
view where there's there's a device
devices are four different people
essentially I've thought for a while
that my mom should probably have an
iPhone right and she got one and she got
one and she loves it and it was
incredible
how fast she learned how to use it it
was nuts like remembering the pickup
time for her to pick up an Android phone
and learn how to use it like it took I
think it took sorry mom throwing me
under the bus I think it took probably
over a year to get her to know the
difference like she would send text
messages as emails and we never figured
out how she did it and she would just
like there was just these and there was
problems like that across the entire
thing and they never went away
buh-ba-ba-bah she picks up her iphone
and she's roaring immediately upon
picking it up the one problem we had was
she got like a pop-up ad thing in a
browser Jo and I couldn't figure out how
to get rid of it for it took me
ridiculous amount of time and I was
super mad we eventually figured out you
have to long press but like not quite as
long as the other long press okay which
in my opinion is really bad but whatever
that's totally different but other than
that absolutely loves the phone it is
the perfect phone for her here's another
problem with that video Kombat wombat
says it's called a review Linus it's not
your job to fellate Apple or Apple users
don't think those are
it wasn't a review yeah in fact that's
what I think a lot of the Apple lovers
were really upset about was they missed
that it isn't a review the video is
called I'm trying to even Apple doesn't
care about the iPhone 10s yeah because
that's really what inspired that video
was that watching Apple's keynote they
just didn't seem to give a rat's patoot
about it so if you were reading like a
magazine or reading an old sold an
old-school like written review web page
this would be an opinion piece yes and
that's exactly what it was where that
would fit I kept seeing super chats
coming in but I kept thinking that they
weren't showing up or something because
I didn't realize that when they show up
at the bottom not the top so that's vibe
online never gonna give up the og pixel
gonna ride it till it dies I mean mine
has a honestly I probably would be able
to see about replacing yeah you gotta
just borrow and I fix it kit from work
and change that screen note I did an
iPhone 7 plus the other night it's like
I'm pretty happy with the phone repair
is not it's not that hard
no like people make it out like some
kind of black magic but like if I could
figure out yeah I wonder how hard
replacing the battery is because the
battery could last a little longer
probably easy if the battery could last
little longer and I could swap with a
cracked screen I'm stoked this is
something that I think is a huge I'm
gonna get back to super tats in a minute
here but this is something like great
idea for an enterprising individual or
company out there free of charge
have you ever tried to find an upgraded
battery for a phone like as battery
technology but a long time ago yeah like
a phone that is three years old now and
battery tech has clearly come aways and
it's right around the time that those
people are gonna start needing to
upgrade their batteries I would love to
have a trustworthy high-quality
replacement battery that even gives me
like five percent more capacity than the
original one because there's something a
lot of people don't know about the
batteries in their devices usually
there's like a plus or minus as much as
five or 10% of the actual capacity that
you get versus the advertised capacity
and so if someone was willing to even
just bend them bin batteries so that you
can buy an ultimate a premium one really
good one yeah like a premium battery
upgrade option I don't if it's great but
I'm not sure the things I do on my phone
don't require wicked performance and the
camera on the original pixel is actually
quite good it's not it's not flawless
the new cameras are definitely a lot
better than it but I also have a DSLR so
if I like really need a nice photo I can
just do that all right
gamers Nexus and PC world are apparently
crossing streams to join the lulz
thank you guys JW Dickason says so you
guys are like the Canadian Mafia
laundering money through YouTube to gain
some sort of monetary advantage I'm on
to you
okay no no we're all losing yeah YouTube
singing yeah um the EU has a chemical
fee applied to electronics this is from
brawl probably about the difference in
pricing that may be true but so does
Canada yep so there's that it might be
higher um Katie a person asks when is
your next sleeper PC actually we've got
a couple of sleeper projects on the go
right now one of them is pending some
pretty close collaboration with and
as-yet-unnamed but it'll come as yet
unnamed device manufacturer where we're
trying to get one of their displays
separate from the actual device and then
we're trying to adapt regular
DisplayPort to their slightly
proprietary embedded DisplayPort so that
we can do a sleeper iMac g3 that
actually has a square display yeah
because almost nothing with a modern
screen has that aspect ratio anymore and
it's not quite right but it's closer
than you would probably think so all
that that's something we're working on
another sleeper that we're working on is
a sleeper rear projection TV so rear
projection the cool thing about rear
projection TVs was they had a lot of
space in them right
so if you were to take a modern OLED or
like quantum dot LCD and you were to put
it in the front figure out a way to
mount it get the sizing like mostly
right you could actually build a
receiver yeah game console yeah gaming
PC like you could build a bunch of cool
crap into the back and the whole thing
would bug multi-device it would look
worthless to a thief but it would be
like the bang inist all-in-one home
theater it would be so awesome yeah and
it would probably even have like decent
speakers because they did you could
probably even take like the area where
they had their speakers you could put
like a really nice modern sound bar in
there
that's cool I really like that one
that's really awesome I'm actually at a
soundbar manufacturer reach out to us
about a sponsored video recently that is
a great pitch swapping out a sound bar
like the sleeper TV though yeah losing
their sound bar to make it not only look
but sound great that'd be awesome
interesting all right Bashan it says so
much better than gamers Nexus I'm not
saying that because I agree I'm just
saying it cuz it was like a super chat
you know you have to you're all I have
to I'm obligated yeah Oscar says hey
lions fun thank you helped me make my
first gaming PC I love it when people
tell me that there's actually like
awesome cuz the funny thing is we don't
really do build guides anymore no last
time we did a build guide was like over
a year ago yeah something like that
we used to do them like once a quarter
and the reason in case you guys are
wondering the reason we kind of stopped
doing them was like what's left to say
we have already done like the goal that
I set out with when we started doing
build guides was to make the definitive
how to build a PC video I feel like we
accomplished that several times over
with a variety of different themes like
you really can build your own PC using
one of our build guides and all that
really changes from year to year is the
model numbers and even then not not much
in some cases so that's why we kind of
stopped doing them but that doesn't
change that those are the ones that
people really like it's the first thing
out of their mouth when they approached
me at like LTX or CES or something like
that and it's it's awesome because that
really is you know I think our job is to
inspire people my
those two my favorite one is that we
like inspired them their career you know
what I mean like I got into computers I
got into programming or I got into
whatever because of your show I'm like
that's pretty cool Stephen gamers Nexus
my viewers say you think my card got
blocked is this a ploy to get more money
out of me to prove that you're wrong
yes and I got that $5.00 man I got it
it's in my wallet right here $5.00
boom it's a new technology holler
teleports right into ya Google Wallet
Wow it unfortunately converted to
Canadian that sucks how do you know what
else sucks this shows that the show's
over yeah thanks for watching guys we'll
see you again next week same bat-time
same bat-channel
instead of our intro here's a message
from our sponsor
Marissa ploy press F and chat for the
show oh oh wow wait no we actually got a
new emoji for members we have
memberships available on YouTube now and
I don't know is it :
when you do emoji I think it's how do
you type in emoji
yeah well ltte twitch viewers have the
same emojis they've had before whatever
dude that's cool you're on that out hold
on no no this one's great though way to
favouritism it just like Android in your
iPhone video Wow
hold on a second where is it oh okay
hold on hold on hold on here we go in
the LTTE dragon with a capital D oh is a
capital D that might mattering it oh
here it is here it is yeah yeah did you
see the dragon no you haven't seen the
drag I saw it come in and I saw it on
the pallet I haven't seen it out yet
it's open okay go look alright no look I
got it
it's the best is the greatest oh I know
right I know right I know right the best
thing ever
what the heck did someone just send 200
what is this is that 200 Australian
dollars because paying three dollars a
month on floatplane doesn't seem like
enough for Canada's hottest export lukla
frontier says add a donation button to
floatplane already so YouTube doesn't
get all my cash look we're working on it
