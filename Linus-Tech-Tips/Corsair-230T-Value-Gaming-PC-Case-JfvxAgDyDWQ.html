affordability and performance the SP 924
may data makes upgrading to an SSD
remarkably safe and simple so the
graphite 230 t appears on first glance
to be Corsairs response to the cheap
bold looking gaming cases on the market
that deliver a lot of flash but not a
lot of - upon further inspection we find
that that's exactly what it is
it's relatively compact and lightweight
doesn't have a ton of extra features
comes in a variety of colors and
includes orange red or blue LED fans
depending on the configuration you
choose as well as an aggressively shaped
window and speed arrows that are
strategically positioned to make it go
faster this case was extremely
polarizing when it first launched with
many criticizing the looks but I
actually disagree and I feel like
Corsair has nailed their target
demographic here with the look but what
do you think let me know in the comments
but while we might normally say okay
it's for gamers check and it looks cool
check editor's choice
this is Corsair and we hold them to a
higher standard than other case makers
because they ask for more money than
other case makers so we're gonna dig
deeper and evaluate this case as if it's
not just empty bling and it has to
deliver in terms of functionality as
well also I like tearing apart his
creations and finding all the
cost-saving compromises he made just for
the sake of giving George a headache but
before we do that I'll need my special
announcement hat thank you no one's here
with the spec but before I do that I'll
need my special announcement hat thank
you because to celebrate geek Pride Day
motus is hosting their annual geek
stakes sweepstakes and giving away some
serious swag including an MSI GSC an
oculus rift electro camera and AR Drone
and more it runs until June 6th and you
can find full details in the link in the
video description but it's pretty simple
just like motifs on Facebook fill out a
brief form and you could be drawn at
random to win you're allowed one entry
per day so make sure you're coming back
to increase your odds but for those
motifs you might ask and why are they
giving
stuff away modus is a global IT staffing
and recruiting company with dozens of
offices worldwide that connects
professionals with careers at great
companies that range from small startups
to Fortune 500 it costs nothing to
submit a resume and an exciting new
career could be waiting for you check
them out at Lotus comm starting at the
front of this case we've got 2 USB 3
ports headphone and microphone jacks and
a pretty cheaply implemented power and
reset switch setup that makes only one
side of the power button actually
pressable not a huge deal though moving
down we find three five and a quarter
inch base that for some inexplicable
reason aren't actually perforated and
only have what look like holes filled in
with plastic maybe this is to keep the
front bottom to top back airflow scheme
in the case operating smoothly but other
than that I'm not a hundred percent sure
further down we find the included dual
front 120 millimeter LED fans orange on
this model behind a mesh fan filter that
unfortunately is actually quite
difficult to remove for cleaning you
need to remove both side panels which
slide on front to back rather than back
to front for some reason then undo all
six plastic clips individually to remove
the entire front bezel moving on to the
top of the case we've got nowhere to put
this side panel or what I mean to say is
we've got ventilation holes with
noise-isolating rubber grommets in them
so they can be easily moved to support
either dual 120 or 140 millimeter fans
or even a dual 120 or dual 140
millimeter radiator as long as your
motherboard heat sinks don't interfere
with the extra thickness from the red
unfortunately our saber-tooth z87 didn't
allow either of these radiator mounting
options so we went with a rear 120
millimeter thick red to match the fan
that was already in there but your
mileage may vary also at the back we've
got our standard 7 PCI expansion slots
with some extra ventilation holes next
to them and the bottom mounted power
supply with an easily removable fan
filter that will keep dust from the air
that it intakes directly from the bottom
of the case of note is that you can
install the fan either way so we opted
to leave the fan facing up this doesn't
make use of that dust filter but it does
keep the power supply safe if you plan
to use the PC on a car
where the other orientation would result
in basically zero airflow that's an
issue with any case with the bottom
mounted power supply pretty much though
moving inside we start to find some nice
little coarser touches in no particular
order the motherboard standoffs are
pre-installed with their signature
nubbins standoff in the middle that
holds the board in place while you're
installing it all the metal bends are
folded over and nicely finished so it's
pretty much impossible to cut yourself
while you're working in this case all
internal wires and connectors are all
black down to the very ends with the
exception of the HD audio connector a
notable feature by the way at this price
point makes it look really clean inside
and the tool is five and a quarter inch
two and a half inch and three and a half
inch drive mounts are all pretty well
implemented the five and a quarter inch
bays use a simple metal tab system the
four three and a half inch bays each
have a nice long spike that goes into
the side of the drive that holds it very
securely in place and they feel
surprisingly rigid especially when you
consider that the cage is actually
plastic something I don't recall having
seen before and then finally the for two
and a half inch mounts are easy to use
with a simple you know slide in from the
back technique it's not perfect though
it is pretty tight as you jam it in
there but quite loose once it's
installed so if you put a hard drive in
there with a slimmer than usual profile
it might wiggle around causing damage
now go listen to the last twenty seconds
or so of this video and think of penises
this time you're welcome
ease of use aside cable management is a
bit of a sore point with the two and a
half inch cage for me since Corsair
recommends you leave the SATA connectors
hanging towards the video card I know
you won't see them due to the shape of
the window but I still wish they could
be managed differently somehow other
than that cable management isn't bad
there's isn't a ton of space behind the
motherboard trade due to the compact
case design but anchor points on the
back of the tray will help you out the
eight pin connector to the nice big hole
at the top left of the motherboard tray
and the bent right hand side gives
plenty of space for your 24 pin and PCI
Express cables for everything else you
can use a combination of the space
behind the motherboard tray or above the
hard drive and SSD mounts to make things
as tidy looking as
you can it would be easier to achieve
perfection with rubber grommets in the
spacious cable management holes here but
that was obviously a cost-saving
omission
speaking of holes between the ones on
the right and the bottom of the
motherboard and the large CPU cutout at
the back I expected the motherboard tray
to be pretty flimsy but I was very
pleasantly surprised in this regard it's
rock-solid in fact the 230 T meets or
exceeds my build quality expectations
even my unreasonable coarser ones in
every way especially when you factor in
the solid price point it's just plain
better than similarly styled blingy
competitors so at the end of the day I
guess that's what this is it's a value
case that I think will appeal to its
target audience one that delivers good
if not groundbreaking features and
cooling and surprisingly solid build
quality at a fair price
it gets my better than spending your
money on a really fancy stake then
forgetting to cook it in time and you
get a disease from eating it Award for
stunning excellence in the field of
humdrum mediocrity an award that I
reserved for only the best products that
target a given price point and achieve a
compelling enough value proposition
that's someone looking to spend that
amount of money might want to consider
buying it all of these silly award jokes
aside this is actually why I don't
really review much entry-level stuff I
feel like there can't be any surprises
in my conclusion about the product the
230 T is good but it's made by Corsair
it wasn't going to be totally stupid in
the first place it was going to be good
I mean because of cost constraints
though it's not like George can make the
rivets out of like magnesium unicorn
horn alloy so I just feel like there
isn't much to say other than it met my
expectations
but you guys let me know if I'm wrong
was this video up until the goofiness at
the end as interesting to watch as when
we cover high-end stuff do you just
straight-up want to know like what's a
good $70 case so you can go and buy a
truckload of 230 T's tomorrow or do you
prefer that we focus on the high-end
stuff that's fun eye candy but you don't
necessarily intend to buy need your
feedback my peeps and I guess like all
the all the jokes aside from the you
know how
drum mediocrity actually very solid case
definitely recommended by at seventy
bucks if that's what you guys are
looking for alright so that's pretty
much it guys
