brought to you by deep brand dude we're
stupid mostly but still we totally is
not the brand new MacBook sitting at the
table oh oh alright let's see what this
thing get oh yeah I can't believe you
just did that
we're knees total just lots of Rainey
laptop just sitting on the table if it's
gone
oh no felt don't talk like that man I
can't believe we just did that
alright please visit thank you thank you
so much we deserve that that was dumb
we even looked the leftovers I like how
achieving that is leftovers Oh guys
trying to sell a dead GTX 40 I was like
GTX 480 30 bucks I am gonna do it I'm
gonna do it I'm gonna I'm gonna lowball
him I'm gonna offer like 15 bucks
cuz this has been listed for quite some
time I'm going to tell the guy that I
need it for a school project to fix it
and that I can't afford to pay for it
I'm going to try and get it for free all
right I heard back from the
280x guy from before 160 he says is the
lowest he can do on that
so that might put that out of our price
range if we can get something like a GTX
280 or 285 for 30 to 40 bucks I don't
think that's going to perform four times
better
oh shoot the SSD for 39 bucks someone's
apparently coming tonight at 6:30 for it
okay maybe I should find out if I should
offer a bit more than asking I'll find
out what other SSDs are going for
because the fact that someone's coming
to pick it up means it's definite
be worth the 40 bucks okay they're like
no SSDs on Craigslist
okay so we're running into a bit of a
dead end on our SSD search the one that
I wanted on Craigslist that I contact oh
he's gotten back to me whoa oh you wants
me there by 3:00 p.m. we're done okay
yeah let's do it
I'm giving him a call yeah I was gonna
come at 12:00 and he said he couldn't
come until 6:30 and if I still had it
that'd be great kind of thing and so ah
so I had reflective one minute for
getting yours so I thought okay I think
I see my way
so we're on our way to go get the SSD
that I sniped some guy was supposed to
show up at 12 and then rescheduled the
6:30 I sent in a lowball offer but I'm
getting it for asking if I come before
that guy so I'm on my way there but I'm
a little bit worried too because this
gives me only two days left and I
haven't even compiled my graphics card
price to performance database yet we got
to drive 45 minutes then as soon as
we're done there we've got to meet up
with someone else where I don't even
know what they have and that gives me
two days to compile my graphics card
price to performance database figure out
what card I'm buying hope that Austin
and Luke haven't bought it yet and then
go get it
not to mention the rest of the
components one thing I'm a little
worried about is so I'm asking some of
these guys like hey are you available
tomorrow to be picked up because it's
three o'clock right now it's a little
kind of X actually sketchy because a lot
of people are you know getting off work
around five o'clock or so so I wonder
what we actually are going to do about
that restriction because it would be
really really bad if like a lot of the
stuff was available but it's like oh can
we media like 6 o'clock or something so
in that case cheating question mark
question mark question mark we were just
just just hanging out I haven't had a
lot of time to hang out with my buddy
Ed's so we just wanted to hang out catch
up
think about just like how much lies
cheating because he's cheating oh yes
he's chief the time so you did it on
both the last one right yeah so it seems
like a safe bet I wonder should we cheat
- that makes sense
you should we show a cheat right
yeah let's cheat right here you're
cheating of course right I'm actually
not well well I'm not either but I just
assume like in theory that you should
probably be cheating if alliance is
doing we should be doing it just saying
that so yeah have fun thank you
okay so I just message to the guy for
the 290 I told him I can be there for
ten thirty
so hopefully that works out I really
really hope the guy was the set up that
I want to buy the motherboard CPU cooler
and CPU messages me back because that
would work out just great so now that
Luke's back we need to be way more
stealthy I don't know was he here for a
while
but he here is talking about me he's too
nice to do that he wasn't listening okay
I don't think I saying
I think we're good Luke's nice he
wouldn't cheat so 7970 Platinum cottage
and I think the best part is this so we
haven't seen 77 saber-tooth board for
$30 the reason it's $30 is because two
of the rooms has no water we don't care
about that we care about is not only is
it also in this place that's right buys
you 970 but we need blocks let's find a
more private place key go upstairs
you're looking that's I don't actually
have anything here but you guys left
your stuff on the freaking table didn't
you is that you guys and stuff what are
you doing why do you abandon your stuff
Wow boxes
hahahaha that was a system Linus Nate
built on Saturday so those are actually
our new parts and they're sitting there
you need to like make sure they think
that ah here hang on come with me let me
just subtly try like sneak that computer
away
so stealthy Wow hey I just wanted to
call and warn you I saw some like
sketchy looking dudes running through
the warehouse with some computer parts
they're running around with what looked
like new computer parts so I'm sure it's
not yours cuz you're far enough to buy
old computer parts
thanks man yeah no I appreciate it but
actually we haven't bought anything yet
we're just we're just strategizing today
we wouldn't know we're just cleaning up
yeah you told me earlier that you had
bought everything well we bought
everything in our minds but we were not
gonna really get around actually picking
it up till tomorrow so don't worry about
it okay yeah cool sorry we got we're
standing I just office I'm just making
sure you guys are okay Oh Cordy we're
golden we're just cleaning at the office
making sure everything's nice and neat
and tidy that's fair that's fair I
appreciate that thanks a lot have a good
one okay now that we can talk freely we
need to work out a few more things none
of these people got back to me which is
still old stressful but so if we get
this core i3 we would need a heatsink
for it we would need to memory and we
need some kind of drive whether it's a
hard drive or SSD we might be able to
swing an SSD I mean max we're gonna pay
a $60 for a brand-new SSD so I feel like
we could probably something cheaper but
if not it's not the end of the world um
so we're looking at probably like a $300
build right now that's actually not that
bad scrap yard Wars we'll be right back
after these messages
this episode of scrap yard Wars is
brought to you by D brand makers of the
precision cut vinyl skins that you'll
see on the phones and notebooks of our
contestants they offer a wide variety of
styles and colors and support for the
coolest devices including the
PlayStation 4 galaxy note 5 and iPhone
6s protect the body of your devices and
make them look great at be brand.com
slash scrapyard Wars officially sent my
offer to the guy that was until to sell
me the maloik CPU and cooler for 80
bucks so we'll see what he says about
that he told me earlier that he won't be
able to check to see if he has a ram
until 7 o'clock tonight so I'm not going
to make any final purchasing decisions
on memory until he gets back to me then
but I'm looking for some leads from
every right now I also told them if you
have some cheap low end power harddrive
laying around to let me know so right
now I'm messaging a different dude who
ended up being Kevin's used computers or
something like that it's a use computer
store around here for a power supply I'm
hoping I can get one fairly cheap off of
him and yeah just trying to do some
legwork on some other stuff but we're
doing pretty good pretty good I think
Brandon I are going to stop and get
lunch pretty soon here all right so we
got a 120 gig SSD for $38 Canadian my
friends that could win us this
competition if it helps us win PC mark
and the guy with the broken 480 wants it
for $25 $25 for what it's broken it's
legit broken so I offered him 10 all
right so we're rolling around to the
literal back alley here
oh dear holy crap what the hell is this
that's exactly right
I don't know okay and this one okay wait
you don't want people fishing through
this bin if they don't know what they're
doing that's an exposed power supply if
you accidentally bridge a contact on
that there's capacitors someone could
actually die okay that that was some
legit like scrapyard
digging I found a literal pile of
Sempron CPUs okay I've got four gigs of
ddr2 I've got a Core 2 quad q6600 yes my
friends I have a Q 6600 and potentially
I have an Isuzu commando board if any of
it works
I spent $60 of my budget on stuff where
I am legit
really not sure if any of it works but I
also got an an tech smart power 450 watt
power supply with a PCI Express power
connector
all right so so far my brilliant
strategy of low-balling everyone is not
going to well not getting a ton of
replies and this one guy is extremely
combative here something about why would
you offer less than a half you looking
to get told off so I'm kind of thinking
I'm going to come back with asking price
was out to lunch not my fault people
don't know what their stuff is worth
here's a card that performs better with
multiple ones listed for 50-ish good
luck with your sale brah some might say
that this is cheating I would respond
with that I don't think that they
understand
scrapyard voice because I got something
from the scrap and I'm turning it into a
thing if that isn't the meaning of
scrapyard horse and I don't know what is
no way we just heard back from the guy
with the $25 6850 that is by far our
best one yet with other people telling
me off about asking my mom for money
we've done awesome we have oh my ice-t
is running down the roof oh no ah maybe
I can get it hold on really yeah I'm
gonna pull over hazards
hold on mates maybe it's still up there
I don't think of it maybe it's still up
there ah damn it yeah it's all over the
roof of the car okay so an email from
the z77 people just came in I have more
than 10 people emailing me about it I
don't have time to meet in Skye's train
station stuff wait I'm available this
week is tomorrow 11:00 to 5:00 and I
have someone who said he is coming so if
you're really interested coming around
11:00 and email me before you come I
think we got it need to go Andy because
I think what's helping us a lot with the
AMD cards is the fact that tons of
people were using it for like bitcoin
and litecoin mining which means that
there's tons of these cards around and
they're pretty cheap because they've
been abused so that's helping us a lot
so that's why there's so many 7950 and
79 70s
here but not as people are getting back
to me if we do the i3 in the 770 we're
talking 280 if we bump that up to a core
i5 at a 6990 we're looking at 420
actually 419 so but the problem is the
power supply we absolutely need some
kind of other power supply for this so
we're talking about a lot more money but
a core i5 in 6990 that's pretty solid
and we're still talking about definitely
well under $500 okay so it just texted
the guy about 69 90 so if we do the 69
in the core i5 the little power supply
that we have is not going to work so
what we might have to do is go back to
the idea of putting an extra power
supply on the top of the rig and just
wiring it straight for the graphics card
factory powering out half the graphics
card ah probably not the smartest idea
it should work in theory okay so to
recap we have a core i5 2400 at Kevin's
used computer we also can get a 200 kick
hard drive there most likely you can get
some kind of cheap power supply as a
secondary for our graphics card we have
a case we have our second power supply
we have a motherboard we have the memory
which we can just pick up at the NCIX
it's like 30 bucks no big deal
and we have the graphics card which we
will pick up in Richmond at some point I
will text the guy in a minute 69.95
computer to me are we forgetting
anything
is that salvageable that I just saw it
was good we got the motherboard to mount
it works the spacing is okay the power
supply will mount here or up here so
it's the actual power spot that I get is
probably going to be a little bit longer
so it's it goes to here cables come out
of here cut it this way cut it this way
but I want to build a wall that I can
sit against I'm going to cut it with a
circular saw okay so this isn't me
helping this is me making sure he
doesn't cut his own hand off
looks like you're hard at work over here
I'm done you happy Austin I'm happy that
you're five minutes late I'm very happy
I'm gonna get some extra time get some
some wood going on it's a smart move for
computer bill I usually have wood I just
thought I'd incorporate in a bill I mean
it's a natural like you want you to make
sure yeah of course one thing I wanted
to use power tools in a good safe
environment second thing it's only five
minutes and it's supposed to be transit
time and I'm already here so I don't
really think it's that big of a deal
going over all so to be fair you're in
my space when I could have been working
Oh
so I also think you're not supposed to
be in my space I'm pretty I believe I
asked you to leave and you did not yet
say that the outside is your space you
can't say to the entire outside you
worked in two different areas of the
office I needed tools from over there
and couldn't go over there cuz your
parts were over there so I waited until
later oh oh thank you for not looking
all the parts I bye well I thought you
didn't buy any parts hey my murse you
know your parts nothing bought
whatsoever I'm just having fun and this
is all for a good sport sorry but does
Luke have enough wood does the crack
pipe line is found still work find out
next time on scrapyard wars</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
