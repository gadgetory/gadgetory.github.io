completion we've got it out in the
middle of the room being stress tested
by Rumble and Oh for some reason my zoom
isn't working it goes okay so he the
first the first thing he decided to do
now that it actually has carpet on the
top is go sit up at the top and just
roost so we've actually got carpet over
most of the cat tree now and there's my
staple gun we've got the windows all
carpet the carpet is all folded back
inside the house and what remains to be
done now is the upright pillars so I've
got this sisal natural weave fabric that
I'm gonna use for that and hopefully
I'll be able to cover as much of it as I
can with the sisal anyway there it is
finally nearing completion hopefully the
next video I do on this project is of it
being completely done</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
