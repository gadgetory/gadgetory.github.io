this is a blu-ray notebook PC which is
actually pretty good for the price point
that we're looking at here actually
let's see what a suit has to us whoa
okay usually when I pull on this it
pulls like the whole notebook out but no
not today
all right let's see what a soos has to
say for themselves this is the a 52 F
xt-22 it's a 15.6 inch HD notebook with
a last generation Core i5 484 gigs
around 500 gigs hard drive a blu-ray
drive Windows Windows Home Premium Wow
Windows 7 home premium man that was
difficult and what else do we have - so
it's got the astute accidental damage
warranty so remember a Seuss's warranty
is second - is top-notch
basically what they're able to do is
they actually offer accidental damage
warranty by default on some of their
notebooks cues including this one so
that means apparently water electrical
fire or even if the screen gets busted
up according to the little pictures on
the side of the box all right so let's
have a look at the accessories that are
included and not a whole lot in terms of
accessories we've got the battery baby
up okay battery looks a little something
like that shiny alright next we have the
power adapter which is kind of standard
pretty small that's good and then we
have a power cord which goes with the
power adapter all right having a look at
the notebook itself it seems like pretty
standard fare for a 15.6 inch notebook
alright so the overall thickness is just
a bit like that so I'll just hold up the
iPhone 4 for comparison someone actually
questioned my iPhone 4 sides comparison
to something like blah blah we know you
have an iPhone 4 get over it yeah that's
really not the point the point is just
in terms of size how it compares to
something that everyone knows that's the
point so there's the iPhone 4
Harrison against the notebook itself you
can see at the top of it actually has
kind of a nice finish on it with little
sort of lines and a shiny Asus logo on
the back okay the bottom is pretty
pretty normal I'd say there's nothing
exceptional about the bottom of the
notebook you've got a nice big access
panel so if you do have to let's go
ahead and for the battery in so if you
do have to upgrade your RAM or hard
drive or anything like that you have
full access to it it is not blocked off
in any way by warranty void if removed
stickers so that's really nice if you
want to make little upgrades there so
let's have a look at the outside of the
notebook before we open it up so here
this looks like vents or speakers or
something I don't know some see some of
these top holes that go all the way
through and some of them don't so I'm
not gonna not going to question it at a
certain level alright let's move around
to the other side where we have our
blu-ray drive a USB port we have an SDHC
reader
we've got Gigabit Ethernet and then our
power in moving to the back of the
notebook it's got a long battery at the
back so there's no ports on the back to
speak up on the other side we have the
Kensington lock we have a heat pipe heat
sink cooler you can see the heat pipe in
there carrying the heat away from the
CPU we have VGA out which I still do
like to see it's handy for older
projectors and whatnot HDMI out to more
USB 2.0 mic and headphones so it doesn't
have USB 3 but this is more of a value
positioned notebook so I'll let that
slide alright so go ahead and very very
glossy finish overall to the unit here
so you can see that glossy battery
matches the finish on the notebook
itself and then there's a blocky screen
with a blocky border so I decided to
turn it on because my battery has died
on my camera so I press the button over
here and then it turns on let's have a
look at the overall layout so we have a
multi-touch pad here ooh
apparently it has facial recognition
logon so that's kind of cool here let's
have a look at the features that it's
talking about right over here so smart
power management their power for gear
now software's been up for a long time
works great facial recognition log on
and poem proof technology so it's to
prevent you from
gently moving the mouse around while you
are typing see with your palm like like
this doop doop doop do like that okay
I'll have a look at the keyboard layout
overall very very sensible layout see we
have full-length shift key full-length
backspace key full length enter full
length shift nice big control that's an
interesting design choice right there
our arrow keys are arranged correctly so
that is to say like a desktop keyboard
and it does have a full number pad very
handy thumbs up to soos for getting the
keyboard it's pretty much bang on right
with this one so function keys up here
you can put it to sleep you can turn on
or off your wireless brightness up down
turn the screen off switch to external
turn off the touchpad mute volume down
volume up while your standard fare the
only thing I'd say might be missing
would be media control keys but that
should be okay shouldn't be the end of
the world one way or the other
oh no there they are aha function and
arrows is your media control so there's
lots of good function keys so when you
up okay yes the click thing here oh it
has plastic over it so it's probably
shiny once we yet can get that come on
once we get there we go moves shiny see
very shiny okay ah so yeah you've got a
few different options for languages so
you know Portuguese French English what
else I don't know some other ones that I
don't recognize there we go so oh
actually this is supposed to be English
yeah okay this is actually for one of
camera man's relatives so he's helping
me get things right well I set it up
here and I think that's pretty much it
