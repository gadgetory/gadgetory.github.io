unboxing of the silent X I extreme a pro
series he piped cpu cooler so this is
the I xc90 to ha2 so I'm going to hold
that a little bit closer to the camera
or better yet I could use this
particular little trick of mine where I
have a little remote that will zoom in
on it ha no cameraman today but I go
anyone so it is less than 18 decibels
according to Simon exit supports all
Intel sockets including 775 and AMD
socket Wow 754 and am too so that means
you've got support for 775 into a m3 and
you can see that there's another little
sticker on here that says intel core i7
compatible if it would focus there it
goes so intel core i7 compatible that
means that it is compatible with LGA
1366 as well this is a 92 millimeter
version designed for smaller cases so
why don't we have a look at now let's
have a look at this side of the box as
well so I'm going to do this as evening
thing inside look alright so first of
all this is a heat pipe direct touch
heatsink and at the time this was a big
deal but it uses eight millimeter vs 6
millimeter on there saying those
competing products heat pipes that means
that it can transfer more heat faster
next of all uses the latest generation
of silent X I extreme a pro fans and
lastly 38 tightly spaced aluminum fins
off for nearly a class-leading 5000
centimeter squared of surface area let's
go around to the back where it just has
a little bit more about the basic specs
as well as some come on focus you can do
it no you can't do it ok as well as the
compatibility info which is horrendously
updated ok so why don't we open this
thing up and find out just what is
inside so I'm going to go ahead and
point that kind of there and then oh
this is brutal
having someone operating the camera what
are you gonna do okay let's get the Box
open so the first thing we find inside
you can see that they have packed in an
LGA 1366 bracket all right there it is
and then the next thing you'll find is
they have got a little instruction sheet
here so that covers the Intel
installation procedure all right so they
show you you put the top racket down you
put four screws through and it uses a
back plate I love mounting systems that
have a back plate it's just so much more
secure than trying to use push pins um
next we have LGA 775 then we have our
four mounting screws and then we have
what else can we got in here all right
we have Lou this one's in color too so
this is the installation guide for 750
for 9 39 million 40 + + 2 so this will
also apply to a m3 so that's in color
and everything check that out very nice
very nice indeed ok what's next the
second to know how to pull down back up
here is a piece of double-sided tape I
don't know what is for yet maybe we'll
figure it out maybe we won't ok keep
digging further in oh wow ok so ah here
is the backplate 4G well which mounting
system is this for because it doesn't
look like it's compatible with both 775
and 1366 so oh ok I was mistaken the 775
version uses the plastic push pins
whereas the 1366 version uses a bolt
through so this back plate is for the
1366 version ok I get it now oh and we
figured out what the what the
double-sided tape is for is for this fan
speed controller so the Kon
is also here everything's just kind of
loose in the box it's not the best
packaged I've ever seen a product but I
mean it's not like any of this is
fragile and gonna be damaged so you just
plug this in on the one side here you
just kind of line it up so that it goes
in like that and then at the one end
this goes into your motherboard header
or into a molex to three pin adapter and
then this plugs into your fan and then
you can use this little dial here to
adjust the fans be very cool okay next
we have okay we've got a little baggie
of thermal compound as well as for
pushpins I'm going to go ahead and
assume that those are for a and X into a
V Plus in three next they include not
only two fan wire clips but for so that
means that besides the ninety two
millimeter fan included you can also
mount an additional 92 millimeter fan to
the unit without buying any accessories
besides what's included in the box okay
so before we get to the actually he tied
cooler itself we have a look at the fan
there it is a 92 millimeter friend the
blades spin like this it's all shiny and
even the fed itself is pretty silver and
shiny it has a one of those transparent
plastic three pin connectors it's quite
long you shouldn't have too much trouble
with that like all of the latest
generation cylonix I extreme a fans it
uses a small hub in the center and their
claim is that that gives you more usable
airflow space versus fans with a larger
house I kind of by that okay next we
have the actual heat pipe cooler itself
so why don't we start because I usually
do this at the end why don't we start
with the obligatory finger shot so you
can see that it is not all that shiny
but if they're to be believed it is
quite flat I can actually feel the
machining marks though quite clearly
with my fingernail whether or not that's
going to be a problem when you're
actually cooling a processor with it
yeah ever means to be seen but you can
see actually I mean I'd like get up to
show the camera this maybe I'll shine
the light directly at it see if we can
get it to focus a little better oh that
is not helping there we go okay so you
can see that they've actually lapped the
heat pipe surface itself so that's what
they mean by heat pipe direct touch ok
and then so these are three and nice
thick heat pipes these are still thick
even by today's standards despite the
fact that this is a relatively old
product and then you can see that the
fins are quite close together now not
really they're not jammed in that close
so this should perform quite well with a
low airflow fan low noise fan which you
would make sense because silent x prides
themselves in their low noise low
airflow fans I mean I don't mean they're
low airflow I mean they're low airflow
compared to a high noise fed the talk is
very shiny so you can probably actually
see my camera there you go now you can
totally see my camera in the top of it
so I really like that has like a silo
next logo on it I think that pretty much
covers if i can find my remote
everything I wanted to say about this
particular cooler and so thank you for
checking out my unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
