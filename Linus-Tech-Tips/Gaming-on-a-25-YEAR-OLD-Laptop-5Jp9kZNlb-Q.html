video the young whippersnappers and our
audience are gonna have a look at how
the previous generation lived because
believe it or not we did have your
mobile computers it's just that to see
that they weren't quite as sleek and
sexy as a modern Ultrabook would be a
gross understatement thanks to world of
warships for sponsoring this video
it's the free-to-play online strategy
game that features millions of players
battling to upgrade their armoury of
ships weapons and well armored tuna at
the end of the video or click the link
below to learn more so step one I guess
is to get this puppy booted up now this
might not stand out to some of you but
one of the first things I noticed about
this thing is the power cord
fascinating isn't it it's just a normal
power cord there's no external power
brick this thing has an internal power
supply are you kidding me alright we're
gonna get this plugged in now brought in
the electrician who I borrowed this
thing from he's got like a tech Museum
in his basement that guy he actually
told me the battery on this thing does
work but lithium batteries don't age
very well so I'd be surprised if it
stays on longer than a couple minutes so
we're gonna power here
this is like so exciting he also told me
that he pre-loaded my favorite game on
it which I don't remember talking to him
about retro games at any point so let's
see what do you put on here Wow is that
80 Meg's of RAM
that's actually pretty respectable for a
computer of this era I mean it's not
amazing but it's ok you know windows 95
so that makes this thing significantly
older than Jake like we literally have
people working here who are younger than
this laptop I haven't heard that sound
in so long all right so this is it this
is the desktop experience it's a go any
brighter no it does not
wow that is not a fantastic display so I
just wanted to check that RAM amount and
I realized I don't actually remember how
to access task manager in Windows 95 you
can't just right-click the task bar
monitors the system resources your
programs are using like any program the
resource meter uses system resources
when it's running this may cause your
computer to run more slowly in that
great back when we had like 100
megahertz CPUs your computer would warn
you about opening up resource monitor
because it could affect your resource
consumption Wow that is a fairly
rudimentary resource meter well your
system resources
they're very 86% free as for your user
resources same thing won't we try one of
the other similar looking things here
how about system monitor okay that's
more like it so we're using about 40
Meg's of RAM on what we don't know I
tried the two fingers swipe to scroll
and all I did was move my icons around
just like yeah yeah sure you know what
it gives you an appreciation for you
know modern grid arrangements and
everything snapping into place right how
BIG's our Drive Wow four gigs fat32
storage not beautiful I mean to put that
in context this ultrabook has four times
that in system memory all right so we're
fired up let's get into what Brian
thinks is my favorite game and action
okay there's no way
he would have guessed this but I
actually played so many hours of 1602 ad
back when the only gaming computer I had
was a Pentium 90 desktop that I
inherited from my uncle and his sound on
if you don't happen to have something
playing while you're making adjustments
you can press down for a test tone I'm
gonna need a mouse though in order to
play this game USB
didn't come around until windows 98 se
if I recall correctly this laptop
doesn't have USB actually no hold on
okay oh so that's labeled mouse keyboard
that is a ps2 port and I happen to have
in my bag of Wonders a ps2 to USB
adapter I'm gonna have to go digging
deeper into the bag of Wonders and see
if I have a ps2 mouse okay well we
didn't find a ps2 mouse but I did find a
ball mouse with USB so I am hoping that
this will not bad yes my friends these
were great for all sorts of things
picking up all the dust off your desk
and putting it in one convenient place
to be picked off and disposed of later
throwing these nice heavy rubber balls
at people you didn't like man like hair
and gunk wrapped around this gross
before I settle in for my nostalgic
gaming session though actually why don't
we like take a closer look at this thing
it's got some real problems compared to
modern computers these bezels take up
like as much at the top of the unit as
the freaking screen does they're so big
this touchpad is abominable though with
that said I do appreciate the inclusion
of dedicated left and right clicks here
speakers suck and this thing is
frickin heavy like it is it is chunky
like you were carrying a briefcase if
you had one of these but it has some
advantages compared to modern devices so
even though we weren't really able to
plug in our you know modern Mouse to it
very easily the i/o on this thing is
substantial so check this out
you've got your floppy disk reader
you've got not one but two PCMCIA
expansion slots so these could actually
be used back in the day to add new ports
to laptops
go figure right we've got our rj11 modem
port we've got the ps2 port we ended up
using check this out
that my friends yes that is infrared so
I believe though instead of being used
as just like a remote control or to like
control your TV this was actually for
wireless data transmission oh I know
right we've got our printer port we've
got a dock port VGA out serial and then
all moving around
finally my arm is like actually oh we've
got our cd-rom drive and finally
headphone microphone jacks yes my friend
a headphone jack and check this out
here's a feature you haven't seen in a
while a removable battery now I mean 2.7
amp hours daddy's not a lot and it
obviously isn't gonna work very well
anymore but hey it had it
oh wow seriously when there's an autorun
you can't click anything behind it at
multitasking there's so many things I
completely take for granted these days
alright let's fire up some corel
wordperfect so back to the things that
are good about it this keyboard is
amazing compared to modern keyboards you
might as well have a mechanical keyboard
in your laptop like
this is flippin awesome the layouts
great it's got dedicated keys for home
end page up page down
it's got look at this travel listen to
that like that that is a laptop keyboard
and check this out it's even got
remappable shortcut buttons like come on
1996 wasn't such a bad time I mean yeah
there's no Windows key you know what
those 1602 actually can be run on
relatively modern machines and there is
a game that I legitimately have not
played since like 2002 when the
classroom computers actually ran Windows
95 windows 98 and it's called the Aero
unfortunately getting it seems like it
might be a little tricky so a lot of you
might not realize this but check this
out Windows 95 is actually pre like the
blue Internet Explorer icon this is when
like Internet Explorer was the name
because it was internet mail internet
news and Internet Explorer
what does internet News even look like
what do you please select a folder where
Internet mail should keep your message
of been talking about Internet News
configuration holy crap so we're gonna
have to download the game separately and
then just copy it over to here except
one small problem even though the game
is small enough to fit on a single
floppy disk I don't have any floppy
disks this pop out is this floppy drive
removable holy crap it is there must be
like a catch somewhere for it it
definitely count anyway also rj45 was
considered a fancy-pants feature back
then none of that and of course even if
Windows 95 did support USB storage it
doesn't have any USB ports and Wi-Fi oh
forget about it that was still a twinkle
in the eye of an engineer somewhere like
that that's not a thing how do I write
back
fortunately what is a thing is this old
external CD burner that I have and this
spindle of CDRs that I happen to have
kicking around like I still remember
when if you had a CD burner you were the
coolest kid in class like yeah they were
slow and the software was atrocious also
the blank discs were expensive so when a
burn failed it was like actually a big
deal like okay there goes a few more
dollars great thanks for that but you
could move a whopping 650 megabytes of
data in between the scenes or store it
safely and that is exactly what we are
gonna do now I don't actually have
burning software installed on this
laptop because why would I but I seem to
recall Microsoft building it in at some
point okay how do you want to use this
disk with a CD DVD player the arrow men
finished burning okay I'm burning a CD
it's been a while now when I say these
things were slow like I really mean it
I'm going at a speed that is about eight
times what we would have had back then
in the early days of CD burning I'm only
writing like a mega files and it's still
taking this long because there was the
preamble and the like the the finishing
process that had to be done on the disk
regardless of how much you wrote to it
so let's see if this works
fortunately if it didn't I've got this
whole spindle that definitely is not
earmarked for any other purpose so Brian
must have actually burned this for me
old awesome thanks dude
hey there we go holy crap I think it
worked
the arrow windows 98 give her a second
here got a ramp up that disk okay is
this gonna work
Oh aren't you fun extended memory
successfully initialised press any key
oh yeah the arrow V 1.33 baby hey Jake
you want to play some wee arrow lis
arrow so it's local multiplayer only Oh
some I like Wasden your well your RF DG
and then you need fire change weapons
and jump if it helps at all mine's
really not much better so there's a
mini-map down here wait this before
there's a way to dig fast ah there it is
you hold the direction you want to go
and then you press back so you like you
spam back I think this keyboard has
ghosting issues oh I see so only one of
us can like dig at a time let's get some
explosives going on up in this biz
oh crap it was not what I meant to do
Oh crass modern
that's lower load it's killing me here
no I can't even aim Oh No oh right the
hurt shot
I can't change my weapons cuz you're
holding down keys
I can't change my lovin now you're done
we have 14 lives roomie your all day
yeah when you're better at the game and
the controls are working it actually
goes pretty quick
well the grasshopper is really powerful
whoa
okay next point wins I guess yeah shoot
I shouldn't have said that
atom gun now one of the other things I
used my laptop for when I was a teenager
was looking at pictures so the problem
though is that when you did that just
use Internet Explorer to open a picture
it did it is downloading it from the
cd-rom drive give her a minute oh yeah
there it goes she's loaded she's loading
in skin tones we're really not handled
very well on the default setting so you
can hardly tell cuz the display is so
bad but if you zoom in on this can you
tell how little colors to this thing
like loading in on the edges of the
frame as you you see that oh it's
spectacular now fortunately many older
computers you went into the properties
much like you would today allowed you to
here we go change the color palette from
the default 256 to high color or even
true color now with that said that
didn't actually seem to do much for me
and it might have been Windows 98
where they had a built-in picture viewer
I can I open this with something else
like is this something that's been
altered yeah this is clearly no better
the the bottleneck here may actually be
the display you guys will just have to
take my word for it
16 or better yet 24-bit color was was
definitely a much better experience
when looking at pictures on your laptop
a better representation of skin tones
for sure that is assuming that your dial
up internet connection could even
download anything high res high color I
think that's enough of me fooling around
with this thing
let's get down to bidness and play some
1602 AD sound not working that trend
offers uh it's not a form of DRM or
anything it's just that the sound assets
we're too big to actually copy over to
the harddrive in-game music wouldn't
work without the discount so let's go
ahead and close down the program to try
that one more time and that great single
player Oh lame the yellow and blue
player got big ships to start so
settling a southern island is good
late-game because you've got like cotton
and all that kind of stuff but actually
northern islands were better for food
production we have to explore the island
one moment please
ooh cocoa and cotton hundred percent
yield oh and there's or there we go
build a warehouse the controls are like
so unintuitive man I might go home
tonight and like legit play this game
it's gonna foresters Hut going on over
here
I won't subject you guys to any more of
that though so that's pretty much it
that's a look at not the laptop that I
owned as a kid but one that is pretty
darn close it was a hand-me-down
actually from my half-sisters dad so it
was already worthless then and it's even
more worthless now world of warships is

some would refer to as a thinking man's
