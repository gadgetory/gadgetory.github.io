Corsair obsidian 350d micro ATX case
exceptional expansion and cooling
flexibility for compact high performance
PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more so welcome to my unboxing and
first look at the wdse so this is him
according to Western Digital okay well
first I'll be unboxing right and
normally your drives would come with a
sealed egg but I get a special
engineering sample bag so you would be
ripping this apart but you can see that
I clearly didn't have to do that because
whatever so then you slide it out of the
bag which contains of course the
all-important do not eat yeah and oh
yeah there's a hard drive in there as
well so what's the point of the SC
because there's already
unnhhh as Drive so we've got the red and
then the raid Edition the SE sits
somewhere in between so it's in between
in terms of performance it's in between
in terms of price its ended between in
terms of robustness so WD is rating it
at about three times a consumer grade
device in terms of the writes per year
and they're now reading workload in
terms of writes per year so this drive
is rated at a hundred and eighty
terabytes per year so it's simple do you
need a read an se or an re well do you
write more than 180 terabytes per year
then I guess you better get an re do you
write like not that much compared to
that about a third of that then get
something like a WD red also it's
validated for more than five drives in
an enclosure whereas the red is limited
from about one to five is the
recommended from WD range however I mean
I personally have run Reds in larger
configurations they haven't exploded yet
but you know of course the vibration
resistance is is only as good as it is
so the SE is much more similar to
something like an re in terms of how
much vibration it gives off and how
resistant it is to vibration from other
drives so this one can scale beyond five
drives up to you know 24 drives or even
more in larger arrays it's available in
larger capacity so it's four terabyte
and comes with a five-year warranty
rather than the consumer grade
three-year warranty that something like
a WD red has other than that I think
that's pretty much all there is to say
about this drive it's say
six you know yeah Farid don't forget to
