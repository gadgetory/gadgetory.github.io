makes I can't handle it
welcome to the wind show guys I'm afraid
it's gonna be a little bit late normally
when we start ten minutes late we try to
also run ten minutes late but today we
simply do not have that option because
it's time it's the night I am so
freaking nervous me too
I am like lots of reasons that's my
SmartWatch I actually talked about this
extensively on the wind show yesterday
Oh last week number of steps reached I
just hit my target there you go sitting
here oh this thing's terrible it's
terrible
so I'm actually writing my review of it
from the perspective of everything that
I love about it or everything that I
love about what it could be the ideas
that I love except it's awful yeah so
it's gonna I think the title is probably
gonna be who makes the worst thing I've
I've ever loved or something like that
okay you loved it though I love where
we're going okay yeah yeah SmartWatch
isn't responding close app or wait what
you mean sick the entire SmartWatch
[Laughter]
anyways yeah so I actually I wrote about
half of it before the way I show today I
had wanted to get that shot this week
but didn't happen sorry soon no I'm
excited
it looks too the reason why I asked it
looks to me like a Kickstarter product
no no this is made by Nubia be like Oh
have real like phones and stuff yeah
yeah okay what just happened
oh I have alpha gesture on which is like
their air wavy thing okay so when you go
to use really really good design so I I
mean well to bring it back to the RO
someone in floatplane chat said will
Luke roast Linus Kappa ah well I don't
know
are you planning to just go
and say really nice things about me
because that would be pretty cool I was
I was informed that's against the rules
I actually thought about at one point in
time just going up and complimenting
everyone but like in really weird ways
and then that was that was uh no yeah no
that would be a hard no because then
everyone else has to feel bad that's why
I wanted to do it just feels like yeah
it's really awkward to think of it try
to make fun of me so people are asking
about so we'll talk more about why we
are respectively worried about the roast
because I've got my own whole set of
reasons so do you yep but people on
float plane are asking what's going on
with our streaming on float plane right
now so last night I did a test and it
was pretty bad yeah and we're expecting
for the roast which I believe the live
stream starts in three hours does that
sound right to you yeah three hours and
29 minutes at 8:30 is when it starts is
that right I believe so okay I don't
entirely know but I think so okay at any
rate that's a really good idea Dominick
says technique classic t is amazing they
should do a ran classic T have you seen
the tech link to classic T yeah yeah
we've just the logo right yeah it's in
your merch bin I think Boyd just brought
one down he brought out the last second
I think that's super sharp yeah it's
like really clean good I think al and
classic would actually look really good
that would be pretty cool anyway so we
did a test last night because how much
are you guys talking about the
architecture of it we can talk about it
so
Matar today mning on floatplane it was
through floatplane CDN except it didn't
work with the edge servers so basically
what that means is there was the
uploader that was sending their stream
to the origin server and that server was
sending this stream to everyone that one
server in that one location and it was
really bad
and we've improved it a little bit over
time on our own and we've integrated a
few other CD ends that we've tried but
very recently we started working with
CloudFlare very recently as in yesterday
less and I did a couple test streams and
I did one and everything wasn't cached
and there was some other various
problems and then liest did one and it
was terrible garbage because of DNS
problems and cache problems so people
needed to control f5 their page and
there was a few other problems such as
well now we're doing a combo attack
because of a problem that we had with
our edge server where we're taking the
stream from the Creator bringing it to
our origin server streaming it right now
at least with this stream to twitch and
to YouTube and streaming it to another
CDN which is then streaming from that
CDN to CloudFlare which is then
streaming to you guys and somehow the
latency is still super fast okay and it
seems to be pretty good okay I've had a
couple people complaining that they're
switching between 480 and 1080
unfortunately that's not a like
CloudFlare or anyone else problem and an
experience that we've we've noticed is
that over time it should get a little
bit better because the like weird auto
detection logic that we have on our side
is assuming it's bad and then going like
oh it's actually pretty good and then
giving them more got it
okay got it we've actually got a lot of
really good feedback though so it's
obviously not perfect yet is it just me
or is the audio much better on
floatplane believe it or not that is
actually one of the things that we
identified early on with floatplane as
an easy way to differentiate ourselves
from YouTube YouTube compresses the
audio so much and it's so unnecessary
it's actually a pretty small high
quality audio versus low quality audio
is such a small difference in the
bitrate when you're serving video that
we were just looking at it going what
are they doing might as well just not
touch it just kind of let it go it makes
such a big difference compared to the
the game that you get back from it
max 23
seven says so glad I subscribed on
floatplane this is so much better yeah
so like we have a lot of people right
now that have a notably better
experience your side up holy hell the
difference in quality is amazing yeah
there there are some people that it's
still going to be not great for there
are some people that are still going to
have some quality auto detection
problems there's there's obviously going
to be some other problems as well but we
think the solution that we have now is
better than the solution that we had a
week ago and the solution that we had a
week ago is better the solution that we
had four months ago so it's it's
improving someone so stays here a fan in
the background that's actually the
mini-fridge for our sponsor for the
roast madrenas that is running in the
background I'm sorry next week
next week we won't we won't have that
yeah the fan noise is just a little yeah
it's okay - okay
got people asking are you gonna archive
the roast in full-on floatplane I can't
promise that solid maybe yeah if we can
we will but it's possible that someone
will say something that is just
deplorable not acceptable to me on the
Linus tech tips Channel there's a
there's some alcohol involved and
there's going to be heightened emotions
so I think we're just we're gonna play
it safe
so probably God so the people on the
diet dais stays Gaius yes yes I think
it's Deus sure but I don't really know
so the people on the dais Dyess okay um
are gonna be luke Nick Yvan James is it
he's actually like kind of the emcee so
he's only sort of on the dais you know
who else is internal Dennis is gonna be
on it
Luke Riley blonde Riley and then we've
got I got Nick okay and then we've got
three celebrity guests which I'm so
excited like these guys really went out
of their way there's a lot of work to
prepare for something like this
they're not being paid all we
compensated them for was just their
travel and our accommodations so this is
really genuinely out of the goodness of
their hearts and because they just
wanted to contribute goodness of the
hurt um I've already been told by one of
them that just laying into me so so
Steve from gamers Nexus is gonna be
there tonight he was actually here in
the studio today we were shooting a
really fun video water cooling and
overclocking a laptop nice J's $0.02 is
gonna be there and I'm trying Blaine
Kyle Kyle from big way I know right so
not only is Kyle gonna be there but if
you're subscribed to him on floatplane
as well you will get access to the
roasts exact same quality
yeah chats will be split the chats will
be split so anyone who follows either
Linus tech tips or bit wit on floatplane
is gonna have access to the stream when
it starts in a couple of hours so so get
get height get height it's good I'm
really nervous one one little deficiency
on flow plane that I'm just gonna
announce right now is we have
notifications for videos we don't have
notifications for live streams so maybe
hang out on the page and you should be
good to go yeah do what I did last night
we could upload a short video saying
come check out the stream we used to do
back in the day for shows yeah weird
that might be a decent idea actually so
yeah if you guys are more into Kyle than
you are into us then just go to
floatplane comm sign up and then
subscribe to Kyle and if you're more
into Linus tech tips then go to
floatplane comm sign up subscribe to us
if you're more into both of them right
now each of us is only three dollars a
month for early access and behind the
scenes and whatever it is that we upload
there so that's probably going up I
wouldn't be surprised
Linus media group is definitely raising
pricing once the tiered
thing rolls out properly and I wouldn't
be surprised if other guys do too
because the reality of it is with
payment processors taking as much as
they do there's just not that much left
in very small transaction amounts so
it's like it's one of those really
frustrating things because on the one
hand we understand that a lot of people
can only give a little bit and
absolutely appreciate that but on the
other hand quite frankly Visa and
MasterCard and PayPal don't need to get
that much richer and they are taking
such a significant portion of very
smaller drinks that it's ridiculous yeah
because there's a flat fee from the
process right
then there's the percentage fee from the
credit card then we got to pay for our
infrastructure then we got to pay for
our people then we got to give money to
the creators it starts to dwindle down
really fast people are asking if people
from now will be grandfathered in yes
that's the intention however that
doesn't mean that there won't be new
tiers with like higher quality or you
know blog posts or you know early access
to the scripts before we shoot them or
like I don't know we could come up with
cool stuff that we could do and that
would be at new pricing in all
likelihood it's also likely that we
would recognize our og subscribers with
some kind of special mode even site-wide
actually might be kind of cool
could we do a site-wide a milk like we
launched now cuz we did a we did a pre
full platform remote we could do a
pre-launch
like a launch pad or something like that
runway I'd be kind of yeah except no
plans it's water yeah back to the
drawing board some water get the three
little squirting water things yeah okay
but nervousness yeah yeah meat yeah okay
why are you nervous I've got a few
different things one of them Hey all
that stuff we just talked about was set
up last night and this morning AJ went
super ham thank you very much AJ but I'm
gonna be up on stage the entire time
freaking out hoping that everything
isn't on fire so that's gonna be really
great for the nerves
number two is I've been off-camera
except for this and my own stream for a
long time and let alone presenting in
front of you've got a hundred and sixty
people there and content that I've never
even I haven't thought of doing before I
haven't done a full rehearsal of mine
I've like said mine too
the bathroom mirror please tell me it
was the bathroom mirror because that
would be amazing to different people
over discord okay yeah that's it but
like it's weird I have not had time I
only I mostly finished my material on I
think it was Tuesday night it was either
Tuesday or Wednesday night and then I
put the finishing touches on it this
morning which means doing a full
read-through I'm not really even fully
bought I have not done I think starting
all day that's the other weird part is
this type of presenting is totally
different we've both done presenting but
we've never done presenting where people
are going to like interrupt us by
laughing or something yeah I hope it's
good that's been my biggest concern it's
like I have no idea if this is even
funny it's funny I was giving Yvonne a
pep talk right so I was like look even
if the people in the audience don't
laugh don't worry about it too much
because you got to understand that only
about half of the audience is actual
fans okay so I don't know if you know
that but madrenas has a bunch of staff
here there's a bunch of our staff
friends and family of staff some people
brought like I think James brought like
six people I'm trying to drag in a
couple friends so like a lot of the
people might not have all the context
that they need to understand the joke
the ones there in person and I was like
look if if we're going through the Edit
for YouTube and we think objectively
that joke is very funny for our audience
we can we might be able to play around
with the laughter a little bit look look
movie magic
okay I just I was just saying understand
that there could be people out on the
internet who think it's hilarious but
they're not there to laugh and feed you
their energies like do your best like
watching the chat like you might be able
to measure it that way okay but like
even though I was like telling her that
I'm sitting here with like knots in my
stomach
unable to heed my own advice and I'm
like I'm worried about bombing up there
because I have never done anything like
this we're not comedy writers no I was
never even a writer
you had to drag that out of me now I'm
ready company like I don't I'm like the
thing is I I think of myself as kind of
like a funny guy you know in a group but
it's from totally different humor no
it's completely different and the the
kind of like the punchiness and the
cadence that you need to it is so
different because I'm not trying to get
any information across I have no point
other than like your mom done I got you
know from a loudspeaker I I when I first
heard but I was like oh I'm absolutely
in of course I need to be in on this
then I heard because I haven't really
watched roast then I heard you get to
roast his back that sucks and then I
would like had a whole bunch of like
ideas in my head
early on I was like oh I'm fine and then
I wrote them all down and read them out
loud and I was like this is like my wife
I know her really really well I had like
this much material for her just just
notes bullet bullet for like I felt like
I could have done a five-minute set just
on her and then I started like fleshing
it out into like you know like
punchlines I was like this isn't funny
no it's just stupid yeah so this is
where I'm worried where like I don't
necessarily know if I've gotten far
enough away from that this isn't funny
this is just stupid I hope I made it I
have no I don't think to is like much
much less just like my career is making
YouTube videos which I don't really
consume tonight I'm making roasts like
stand-up comedy content which I actually
don't find roasts funny i watch some of
like very famous roasts i watched some
in preparation for this and ones that i
have watched so far it seems to be
people who like genuinely dislike each
other for the most part or like i watch
The Who
really really deserve it like a Charlie
Sheen one sure yeah and it's like and so
I'm like I'm watching I'm watching this
I'm just going like okay
I mean to be clear I don't necessarily
think it's people who genuinely dislike
each other I think maybe you know the
Trump one
oh I haven't watched the Trump play the
Trump one as far as I can tell is just a
whole bunch people who just viciously
hate Trump and I'm like okay I'm
surprised he said okay to this but like
when you get like Seth MacFarlane up on
stage they doesn't like not a fan of no
the Donald so and then like I watched
another one and I don't necessarily even
know these people I don't know famous
people very well as you know so there's
person who I forgot her name Amy Schumer
yeah yeah and she's making fun of I
should really know this one Mike Tyson
and those are those were brutal right
and they really don't seem to like each
other yeah I mean Ann Coulter didn't
think any of the stuff that got said
about her was very funny yeah like a
fair amount I did watch there was one
with Jonah Hill in it and it was like
him and a few of his friends and that
one seemed like genuinely like they were
just messing around was like okay that's
cool but was the only example I think
yeah I don't know it's just but anyway
so I'm up there sort of I have to sit
there and try to appreciate this art
form yeah as the subject of it when it's
one that I don't really fully understand
like I don't really have get and then I
also have to do it and I think both of
us are gonna have challenges but from
opposite ends here in terms of like the
creation of the material so free fro
Kate so for those who don't know members
of the Dyess are not just tasked with
roasting me yeah anyone else up there is
also fair game but this is someone who's
not even up there yet they still have to
have a fair bit of material on me and
that's like I'm not saying because I'm
perfect or something I'm just saying
it's it's hard to come up with really
really funny stuff like a
a lot of it for just one person and I
was told the vast majorities for you yes
and it's actually quite a while you have
to talk for so like it's a lot of
writing okay so from the other side I'm
supposed to sing you all back but I only
get like five minutes as soon as you
guys yeah so so stringing it all
together I didn't even think about that
was I hate shall I would murder me for
like most of it like yeah sure I'm
supposed to hit everyone and you know
what the funny thing is kind of note I
accidentally wrote it with one person
missing because there was actually a
change yeah and what I realized was like
no I can't leave it that way you can't
not zing one person because then that's
weird
yeah right yeah I mean people really why
didn't you go after that guy yeah or
they might feel like does he think I'm
such a snowflake but like I can't take a
joke or something like what's going on
here like like it's almost like in order
to prove that we are friends you have to
do you have to rip on each other and
it's like how savage do I get because
I'm in a I'm in kind of a weird position
to where unlike most roasts I'm in a
position of power and/or authority over
at least half of the people up there
yeah that's another weird spot as I've
never seen one where it's like their
boss yeah I'm really looking forward to
it and I want them to not hold back I've
had people approach me and be like look
I've got something really really mean I
think you'll cry and I'm like do it like
do it do it don't hold back but the
thing is like I couldn't make like the
kinds of mean jokes that I could make
about people like yeah you know your job
performance last year was pretty crap
that's why you didn't get a raise
like that's not funny yeah that's not
appropriate
so I had to figure out like what like
it's almost like it puts more
restrictions on me than it does on them
because I need to know that I'm I need
to dish it back because otherwise I'm
not playing the game properly but with
restrictions
whereas with them I it's full full open
fire you know there were things that I
took out of yours
action there's also things that I took
out of other people's sections just
because honestly it a lot of it came
down to like not only do I think that
thing wasn't necessarily as funny
because almost every time it wasn't as
funny which is one of the reason why I
got cut but like it's either not
applicable as much as the other things
yeah or it's like probably a little too
private I went for much more public
things yeah on everything and tried to
focus on that because some people were
really tough actually I forgot one of
the dais members is going to be my old
boss and so he doesn't have much of a
public profile so it's not like I can
make jokes like remember the time he no
no no we don't haha
so so even though I have to do eight or
nine people or whatever it is in five or
six minutes that's kind of it I also
have to kind of like put some context
behind what I'm saying or like come up
with so I actually have a really good
really good I was when I saw his name I
was like Linus needs to go hard cuz like
I don't have that much time for it like
yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be really
interesting seven says is there a
floatplane blog because it's hard to
keep track of what's going on I've I've
wanted to start one a number of times
but what's happened every time and it's
it's starting to change now especially
so maybe I will start one soon I'm not
sure I've asked him to do this a lot
it's it had even said on when show once
I was gonna do one soon that was a long
time ago the problem is we'll start
working and we're growing in employees
so I certainly become less of a problem
as people are starting to work on things
more parallelized but like I think I
said I was gonna do one of those blogs
right before we went into that's a lot
of rain right before we went into
something that we just refer to as like
the v1 push which is our our framework
went from beta to version one so we had
to spend months just updating everything
to work with version one is that
interesting in a blog nope not at all
for some of our audience members it
actually would be I I don't I don't
think that section I don't that section
was even interesting for our own team
let alone other people that just that
time just sucked we're in we're in good
time now which is cool so a bunch of
things are happening
it's how just like teleported from over
there to over there as far as I can tell
so it would probably be more interesting
now and now I'm I have like a little bit
more incentive to do it but now that
things are more interesting I also have
less time because now I'm trying to hire
more people and stuff I don't know but
yeah maybe maybe after I'm done hiring
people I'll make another attempt at
making the blog I also want it to like I
think it would make more sense to for it
to be on the website and then that would
require time from the dev team to go do
that and there's other like hyper
high-priority things on Facebook would
be fine honestly yeah I could probably
just do that we have a Facebook every
once in a while I'll get an email like
hey you should interact with people I
just we've been in in such a pre-release
state that it's felt you know what I
what you know what honestly the thing
that I don't like about it is that we're
losing so much of our like history one
of the really cool I've got I've got it
all you do yeah okay well I just like I
still have screenshots from the original
version of the forum
I've got screenshots and videos all the
way through Oakley and I can maybe even
do like look where we came from post but
the feeling will be like missing a
little bit I think like it won't be you
won't be like everything is
retrospective instead of like yeah that
was where my head was at at that point
in the journey whereas what's really
cool about Linus Media Group is that
because we create videos every day yeah
it's like it's like a memory trigger I
just I think part of the problem is like
I don't want to star citizen ourselves
yeah cuz like I'm a blog company
basically partially and I don't want to
I don't want to pay for the fact that
like I said hey the apps almost ready
we're gonna open source its
and then like our paths changed a little
bit internally yeah and like hey I'm
gonna do a blog then we start doing v1
and I'm like that doesn't really make
sense anymore but now I'm accountable
for those things everything we put up in
a dev blog we're accountable for right
so if I'm like hey we're starting work
on X project when the next project gets
partway through and then the person
working on it is like hey this other
thing should probably be done
immediately I'm gonna shift priority to
that and we drop X project firk I don't
know six months most of the year forever
who knows things change so you think
that's pretty typical of a dev blog
though yeah but people get angry about
it that's very true and I just I don't
know if I want to deal with that give in
to your anger
yeah oh that's weird
shouldn't there be an admin CP there you
may not be a thingy what did I do
you're in the wrong account bro okay
well I will deal with it another time
because that's the other Co yeah no do
you want that other account I was just
there's so many people in the floatplane
chat saying that they're like brand new
subscribers and they're here for the
roast and i just i was just curious to
see how many people were joining you
know what we should really do is go
through our sponsors for the show today
so yeah first up we've got oh wow the
other should that's weak you know what
no let's do our first tech topic first
and then we will do that so Intel
getting real serious about consumer
graphics or it's like so they recently
this was posted by dais voltage on the
forum and the article that we found in
that name was kit guru and videos Tom
Petersson reportedly joins Intel well
since five days ago
inside rumor or report has been very
much confirmed Tom tap Peterson is
officially at Intel which for me was
like
I can ask Jayden and everyone around me
upstairs when I read this news I did the
same thing like I thought if you cut the
guy open his blood was like bright green
hey guy I was saving this it was so hard
for me to not go off about this because
I wanted to save it for LAN show and
then I forgot about it when we were
sitting here before the showing I'm so
happy because I wouldn't be able to
contain myself do you think it might be
somewhat maybe marginally related to the
hashtag save Tom situation I think that
couldn't help so for those of you who
don't know during a keynote Jensen
basically publicly humiliated Tom when a
demo wasn't going according to plan and
the sort of word on the street is that
Jensen is an extremely difficult boss to
work for not in the way that some bosses
might be hard to work for where they
come in and like berate you for being
stupid because you suck at your job but
they're like an idiot where he'll come
in and berate you for being stupid and
sucking at your job leaning over
spending three minutes and doing it
better than you did I mean like that's
how it's done because the guy is
apparently just an absolute genius
it's just that doesn't make it easier to
deal with them necessarily and this is
all I'm not I can't
I could never Nate I couldn't even name
a source because I don't you remember
where I've heard it from but multiple
people have expressed this sentiment to
me over time yes we know we have to
leave the six oh thanks
anyway so I think what we were seeing
there might have just been a more public
example of something that just exists
yeah with that said I mean but like my
experience with that was that Thomas
effectively disappeared after that for
like a while I tried like social media I
tried to get on a call with him at one
point and didn't he was like gone yeah
yeah well he wasn't gone but like
there had to be a very good reason to
talk to him or something can I just talk
to Tom about this cuz I wanted something
explains to me and quite frankly nobody
explains really complex technology like
Tom Peters he's amazing yeah the thing
is that aside from having a great
personality and having a talent for
dumbing things down he really really
understands it and by really understands
that I mean again can't tell you where I
heard this but word on the street is the
guy basically invented g-sync
and pretty much created the API that we
use for NVIDIA overclocking that
utilities like msi afterburner and EVGA
precision hook into like the guys
important he knows games really big he
knows graphics cards and he's on Team
Blue now to be clear a GPU like Turing
for example is not the brainchild of one
person it doesn't work not even close
and it's not like in videos gonna be
think oh no however will we make another
graphics card without Tom there's a lot
of smart people there it's just that
this one is one that I would have
thought they would have worked pretty
hard to hold on to then again I might
have said the same thing about Raja
Kaduri who defected from AMD over to
Intel I think was last year that team I
was always joking around with some guys
upstairs about how we should start doing
like fantasy team stuff for GPU
companies just to try to guesstimate
who's in who Intel's gonna hire next
because like apparently that's what
they're doing they're just taking
everyone that's like well they hired
Kyle Bennett yeah anyways
[Laughter]
he'll be in charge of outreach to gamers
and enthusiasts I just I just don't know
about if that's a good idea or not I
looked into I was trying to talk to
someone that I'm not going to name about
that one and I was like I'm just
surprised because of some of the stuff
that he like says and they want him for
outreach and then I googled like some
threads with him included and I was like
wow yep I'm really surprised just that
was an interesting move I don't know
anyways one thing that I think is going
to be pretty interesting is a lot of the
communication from Intel has been
extremely gamer focused when I fit it
feels like that's their focus for their
gpus and over the last little while it
feels like invidious focus for the gpus
is not gaming yeah it's data center it's
it's a deep learning deep learning Mars
kind of thing yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm
absolutely fascinated to see how this
plays out and I wonder what AMD's place
in the world is going to be when it's
Intel going head-to-head with Nvidia on
graphics on the graphics side of things
I don't know man but on the CPU side of
things they still seem to be doing
pretty good speaking of things I don't
know I don't know how I haven't managed
to tell you guys about our sponsors for
the land show yet there you go our first
boat sir is a savage turkey I'm not even
hungry today but I want my maple buffalo
bacon I am so hungry I've had basically
no food okay well you can pick what you
wanted that I don't have bacon I'm just
gonna have some nuts savage jerky their
goal is to create a snack that's full of
flavor and spice but that isn't bad for
you they're jerky is made without
nitrates or preservatives and they've
got 13 different flavors of jerky to
choose from like sriracha bacon and
maple buffalo bacon they also make
barbecue sauce hot sauce and a spice rub
and their Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses
one of
hottest peppers in the world the
Carolina Reaper so use offer code ltte
to say 15% on all of their products at
the link below also sponsoring the show
today displayed is back hey cool
apparently people on when show we're
pretty into these so they've got over 26
200 excuse me 260 wait you weren't here
for this no oh these are cool I'm over
260,000 designs they do prints on a
magnet mounted metal sheet so you can
like swap them out exactly that's really
cool so you can't have something like
crooked on your wall just yeah and it
sticks there and so they're durable you
don't need any power tools to hang it
you can just easily and quickly swap
them out if you're into something else
or whatever and this is cool they plant
ten trees for every display that gets
purchased so use code Ltd to save 15% at
lndeed GG / displayed when apparently
after the last man show spot we did our
audience was pretty into these like I'm
talking a lot of dis plates so oh yeah
and we were using them in the sets
already because if we want to change up
the look really quickly it's really easy
clang clang done Earth's super cool yeah
really cool yeah I've genuinely never
seen here's another really neat like
kind of techie looking design I like
that
I like both of them so far but I think I
like this one and finally the land show
is brought to you by madrenas oh yeah
don't take them out why not there's
nothing behind them I know there's none
behind them it's fine so we do have more
of a week we kind of took them all
because we're bringing them to the road
yeah so these are the exclusive Linus
tech tips vanilla cold brew cans and
they are coming soon these are
prototypes by the way and by prototypes
they mean stickers yeah they're just
stickers it looks pretty good for a
singer I had no idea until you pulled it
madrenas coffee is coffee for fuel
organic cold brew coffee and a
convenient 15 ounce can with a flavor
for everyone madrenas coffee offers
sweet and creamy flavors like mocha or
caramel or bold flavors like their cold
brew black LTT has a permanent item on
their East or the lambo roast you guys
should check that out and if you head
over to madrenas coffee calm slash Linus
you can get 40% off your entire order
with offer code Linus if you have any
questions about madrenas or cold brew
coffee or micro roasts or anything
slow-mo from the madrenas coffee head
team is in the chat ready to answer your
questions through direct messages I have
a note in here don't forget to tease
slash mention the roast of - Sebastian
tonight but we spent I think we've got
that covered
we did that for a while I thought the
more I'm just like I'm trying to not I
don't know I go through sections where
I'm like I'm just gonna try not think
about it I'm gonna do some other stuff
to take my mind off it but then I'm like
I should be practicing or reading or
like doing something I know so little
about what's going to happen yeah all I
know is little bits and pieces I know
that apparently half-naked Butler's are
gonna carry me in one on a litter what
yeah that's how I that's how I make my
approach to the stage apparently what I
know who are these people this is like
no it's like a thing what yeah there's
like a service that has like what you
can hire Butler's that 100% must have
been James oh yeah of course I'm sure no
one else was no of course not can yeah
so so anyway so like I've heard these
little boy bits and pieces of what's
gonna happen tonight but this is
probably the least involved that I have
ever been in a major project at this
company yeah because out of necessity I
cannot know exactly what's going on are
you worried about because we talked
about your your worries and one of them
was a complication of you don't have
really enough time per person are you
worried about how I'm not gonna ask for
specific names or any
but are you worried about how people
will take your roasts at all or are you
worried about the presentation and
because I know you're worried about the
writing this is something haven't really
I'm not worried about people taking it
badly okay I'm I'm mostly worried about
I just don't want to be in the bottom
half the bottom half yeah of everyone
sets I don't want to be the best I don't
expect to be the star of the show or
whatever I just don't want to be the
worst I me too yeah that's like you
don't want to be that one person at the
roast that sucked
yeah I'm genuinely worried about mine
another guy I think I think I'll do okay
my problem is I've tested on people so
far and they've all been like yeah
that's super great honey but it's like
my friends so and the other thing you
can't control - I think like no I don't
have time to edit it yeah the other
thing that's like really scary - is that
like what if you come on after someone
that bombed what if it's not your fault
that the audience is half asleep yeah
like what if what if what if whatever
what if by the time I get up cuz I go
last what if by the time I get up there
the whole show is such a complete snore
fest
that like only the friends and family
are left and like actually a pretty
significant amount of people that I've
talked to you don't enjoy roasts I
didn't know you didn't either but like
what if the audience just isn't into it
it's interesting it's something it's
aggressively something we've never done
before
mhm Pat you actually gave a review of
the Lambo roast good quality non
exciting blend happy for the quality but
I've had a Phills kick and that's miles
more interesting which they did
something more dramatic to turn heads
and anger certain people with the Lambo
roast then hit something that's kind of
for everyone and that's boring
honestly I will tell you that was my
director I was gonna say I think they
let you guys kind of design it we
designed it by consensus internally yeah
so we went with what everyone Oh every
possible drinker in the building liked
so rather than something that was very
polarizing that makes sense we back yeah
I guess cuz you went pretty much right
with what he said so Linus tech tips
merch has kind of a new directive now it
honestly doesn't matter like kind of how
much margin we make on it or if it's
necessarily the most sensible thing to
bring down the road map at this time or
whatever the thing is any LTTE merch
moving forward because I was really
unhappy with some of the old stuff just
needs to be good you need to get it I
need to feel like oh they cared yeah
they cared enough that this is good so
I'm fine if it's a little bland but I
would be really upset if the quality of
it was not acceptable yeah so that was
what that was basically that unjust
before getting on the show I would I had
this been delivered to me with my name
on it with shirt so I can't possibly
forget things cuz everyone knows I'm
pretty about it which is great thank you
Boyd but I put the shirt on and
immediately before the show even I was
like wow it feels really nice yes like
the shirts are just better the designs
not out there or anything these are
really logo this is a really simple
desert desert
this is a really simple shirt that we'd
like anyone to kind of quickly feel like
they're not you know shilling for a line
of sanity a group by wearing it they
just it's just I just want to see like
look into nice shirt that's comfortable
and that they they like to wear and once
we get that down once we feel like no
you know what every item that ships from
our warehouse it's just nice then we can
start to do some more out there stuff
yeah I got to tell you the store has
been doing amazing we did a coupon last
week and we did the most orders that
we've ever done in a week by a country
mile and we have the thing is we still
only got like what four or five shirt
designs and like cable ties
and I think there's like one other thing
like some of the really cool stuff that
I think is gonna I made I bet Nick do
you have you seen the water bottle
prototype I think so oh okay I gave it
to Steve so I Q won't have another
chance pretty sure I saw yeah I gave him
our first prototype the one with the
circuit board on it right yes
so matte black with a glossy black
circuit board and Linus tech tips up the
side and orange it looks incredible I
bet Nick I told them if we don't sell a
thousand of them in the first like three
days I think I said I will be floored
because it is so cool it's so cool LTX
is probably gonna have four plain shirts
oh yeah that's right not that many of
them yeah I don't yeah we won't be
printing that they're quite limited
because I don't know how much interest
is gonna be but there's gonna be
something basically if you want to
support Luke and yeah I think like I'm
gonna be buying some well I guess yeah
I'm gonna be taking some or buying some
or whatever giving them to floatplane
staff giving them some friends and
family I'm gonna be giving some to Kyle
and total tech deals so they can have
some of their own and whatnot and then
there'll be like some left that will be
at the event so Garrett carpenter asked
if I justin is going to be there if the
question is about the roast tonight
the answer is unfortunately no I totally
invited her and I would have loved to
have her there and she was like 'omg
totally want to cannot make it work with
my schedule and I was like that's okay
dude I totally get it
but she's not confirmed so don't take
this as gospel truth
my understanding is she is going to be
making her absolute best effort to be a
delta X this year though so our roster
of pretty much confirmed creators is now
about 15 excited I'm crazy excited for
l2 a lot of them are pretty small like
our our cutoff for like kind of how big
you had to be in tech in order to get
free accommodation and travel was fairly
reasonable I think so yeah it should be
pretty good yeah
all right what else do we have to talk
about there are some more tech news
right oh we got to be out of here in
like six minutes uh-uh
I think we're dropping frames like crazy
oh really like on this I think so
there's a whole bunch four hundred and
something
why did Jake change it to GPU encoding
or something
no this still has like a 960 and I don't
think it's no it's not hmm I don't know
what's wrong with this machine maybe we
should just like upgrade it it's only a
six core you know what I noticed too is
our our capture laptop the capture blade
I was trying to record on it today just
1080p 30 and it was at like 90% usage
and it was dropping frames i wonder if
OBS just got a little heavier I don't
know anyway we'll need to maybe we
should just upgrade this machine and
throw more horses at it and call it good
yeah guys yeah I don't think the
problems on flow playing because we're
actually seeing OBS drop the frames here
so the machine that we're using to
stream the show tonight is not this one
it's our streaming cart which we use for
like our Friday live streams and stuff
like that so I would expect that to be
fine uh intel announces their broadest
product portfolio for moving storing and
processing data they've got a whole
bunch of stuff including their 56 core
12 memory channels the on Platinum 9200
processor they've got their
second-generation oh this is cool so
obtain DC persistent memory is finally
here so you can plunk an op tain module
into a dim slot and you can have I
forget what it is is up to a 512 gigs or
something I can't remember exactly how
much but you can have a ton of capacity
in memory as long as whatever you're
doing is not particularly latency
sensitive and it'll allow you to work on
much larger data sets for things like AI
and deep learning and all that kind of
thing let's come on their new agile X
FPGAs are built on 10 nanometer tech so
there's going to be FPGAs out there that
are built on really like the latest
cutting-edge process node so we could
expect to see better performance in
things like
for example high-end video cameras so
there's lots of products that you might
kind of not think about like well what
kind of processor do they use so an FPGA
is a fully programmable chip that can
kind of pretend to be a purpose-built
integrated circuit so instead of using a
general-purpose processor that can come
with all kinds of overhead that causes
it to consume more power or not be as
efficient for a task an FPGA can be
programmed specifically to do just one
thing really well and it's great for
applications like video encoding in
something like a red camera the problem
is that while an FPGA is much more
expensive than an actual accustomed fab
tip you don't have to have nearly the
same volume in order to make your
business model work so as long as you
can build enough margin into your
product that you can use FPGAs which can
be hundreds and hundreds of dollars each
just for your CPU then it's a great way
to get performance that otherwise just
wouldn't be possible so higher
performance FPGAs great thing all around
with that said I don't know anything
about what the real-world performance of
these looks like just sounds pretty good
this is all just announcements right now
so just talking about the news I on
other news this was posted by RC mail on
the forum Amazon to offer broadband Wow
I can't think of anything that could go
wrong with that should I sign up for
Facebook's
phone line while I'm at it yeah that's
that's a little brutal in terms of the
like literally owning your entire life
thing but it's going to be another one
of those like we're putting satellites
in space kind of situations I don't
think they're doing landlines or
anything like that but they they're
trying to increase the amount of people
that can have access to the Internet and
have their home page for stammers on
comm yep so there the project is
codenamed project Piper yep um something
like that so how you pronounce that I
think so it's like kayuu iper or
something yeah I think it's named after
the Kuiper belt which is that makes
sense okay yeah anyway their first
public step took the form of three sets
of filings made with the International
Telecommunications Union last month
by the Federal Communications Commission
on behalf of Washington dc-based caper
systems LLC and filings lay out a plan
to put 3236 satellites in low Earth
orbit holy crap
so it'll be a constellation of
satellites that will provide low latency
high speed brown bat broadband
connectivity to unserved and underserved
communities around the world this is a
long-term project that envisions serving
tens of millions of people who lack
basic access to broadband internet we
look forward to partnering on its
initiative with companies that share
this common vision fantastic the United
Nations estimates that almost 4 billion
people around the globe are underserved
when it comes to internet access they
didn't provide a timeline for deployment
don't blame them I suspect it'll be a
while I guess that's honestly all that I
have because we need to go it is 559
yeah and we need to drive we got a role
so for those of you on floatplane we
will see you there
floatplane is $3 a month go to
floatplane com sign up the livestream
will be in a couple hours like two two
and a half hours and hopefully this goes
okay oh I should do super chat super
chats legit don't ever eat anytime
fast damon amy navi GPUs are gaining
traction again in news media what are
your predictions and thoughts man it's
AMD rumors what am I supposed to tell
you I predict that it'll be whatever it
is and the rumors will have no impact on
that we'll do the intro calm down Brent
says update 4b YFC tickets at LTX coming
later follow LTX expo on twitter paul
says i just want to say keep kicking ass
guys thanks Ryan
you guys are great keep it up thanks
Ryan captain zero does a live stream on
floatplane work on mobile yes yeah yes
yeah I don't see why not through the
browser yeah yeah yeah although we do
have an app update and live stream works
on it red noon what old school forms did
you use to post an extreme system story
extreme overclocking comrade play deals
common NCIX forums mostly ocn but other
stuff included someone with a Russian
name
sent us some rubles you guys Rock thanks
guy or gal Ryan I mean need to get
floatplane oh yeah
so you may need to you probably
shouldn't have spent that $2 on that
super chat you probably should have just
spent it on floatplane but that's okay
good job I found it scheming will you be
doing more RG reg rebooted yes if it's
within our power we will but it's on ACS
whether it happens or not
Georg why does what luke's beard connect
to the right side but not the left what
must be a bug yeah probably is I'm at
get slow playing for the livestream of
the roast
thank you Matt I just reading everything
Zion can you not get interchange rate
for credit card processing what does
that even mean says just subscribed on
floatplane interchange rate for card
process huh yeah I've lost it oh I think
I know what he's talking about and
nodded Eric you don't find it funny cuz
you always roasted well no no I mean
what I'm watching other people's roses
t-bone says I'd love to subscribe to
flip laners they're going to be Andre
gap yes it's not gonna be open source
anymore though we changed our minds more
on this at 11 Joshua Steve equals Tech
Jesus J equals tech Judas - equals text
Moses because sandals thank you for that
Wow ok bye wait Joe they're gonna freak
out hey I'm a graphic designer gamer
artist writer in photography obviously I
spend a lot of time on my computer can
you recommend a good budget chair who
preferably racing as I found the most
comfortable 250 bucks honestly I hate to
be this guy but 250 bucks for whatever
reason is not a lot of chair that's the
cold hard truth is so sorry
Scherzer want to break it to you seeing
the expensive you're probably like a
really good chair you're probably
looking at six or seven hundred and I
hate that there's no reason they should
be it makes no sense to me but they are
Connor says can I come work for y'all so
I can quit my semi crappy job at the
University working their IT department
not unless you applied recently when we
posted job postings ok bye everyone
intro here we go they would actually
hunt me down to murder me
as far as I can tell if we didn't run
that
