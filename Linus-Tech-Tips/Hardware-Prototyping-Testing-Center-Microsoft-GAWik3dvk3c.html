Redmond campus for a special event that
I thought was just going to be a
condensed version of their hololens demo
pretty cool but we weren't going to be
able to film that I had no idea that
they were going to bring us on an
exclusive tour of their advanced
prototyping Center and hardware
engineering labs this was so cool and it
was absolutely unexpected let's go see
what they had in store for us
until skull Canyon knock features a
sixth-generation
a core i7 processor and Thunderbolt 3
learn more in the link in the video
description our first stop was their 3d
printing room much of their rapid
prototyping and content models are
realized in this very room I tried to
find more information about these
specific printers that they used online
but was not all that successful what
they did tell me was that they could
print at down to 14 microns for
incredibly fine details and that they
could print a wide range of colors all
at the same time these 3d printers use
UV light to cure the plastic as it is
extruded and each one of these printers
costs about two hundred thousand dollars
meaning that all eight of them cost
about 1.6 million dollars that's only
you know slightly more than our three
thousand dollar Ulta maker - next up we
have the CNC room or computer numerical
control this is where they run various
prototypes of different metal products
the only thing they would show us
currently being milled was the keyboard
for a Microsoft Surface book everything
else was covered up in different ways
and made very abundantly clear that we
were not allowed to film them which is
fair on the table they gave us a demo of
the process of taking a solid block of
magnesium and turning it into the body
for a surface book all the way down to
the circular ish pattern cut into the
body that helps shed some weight while
keeping the whole unit nice and strong
but this isn't the end for the CNC room
they'll build something in here and then
find some problems with it and try to
solve them which anyone who has done
prototyping or programming knows is just
going to introduce more problems which
then need to be solved as well this
process to get down to a good level will
take about 18 months during which they
will also do durability tests where they
will test both what it can take and also
what it can't learning what the product
cannot sustain can be rather helpful for
further iterations and to be honest it's
just fun I'm sure this had something to
do with it speaking of iterations though
they also showed off the design process
for
again the surface book this area
featured a tiny fraction of the
prototypes that they actually had for
this device considering they were doing
day-by-day iterations on that 18-month
design cycle that I mentioned earlier
there were also large-scale demos of
small features like the surface locking
mechanism that were just straight-up
cool this area was great because it
helped us see into the minds of the
designers and the engineers working on
the project as they evolved from idea to
idea like the spline of the surface book
looking like well the spine of a normal
book moving onwards we have the human
factors room where they specialize in
anthropometrics
or the measurement of a human individual
they have tons of measuring devices in
here including a special room with 36
cameras mounted all around a chair they
use this room to measure Austin's head
with these accurate measuring tools they
can find what tolerances they need to
build into their products like say an
Xbox controller they also have a room in
here that we worked allowed to record in
that can go from near darkness to 65,000
Lux and can change in color temperature
from 2800 to 6,200 Kelvin holy Sh moving
on from there we have the audio labs now
Microsoft has over 25 anechoic chambers
but the main one that we looked at today
cost over 1.5 million dollars it's the
quietest place on earth they can use
this room to measure down to negative 20
decibels meaning they can literally hear
air particles moving oh my god that's
insane anyways this helps them study how
the human brain processes sounds how
different shapes of products can affect
their audio and more and last but not
least we have the soft room and the
paint room where they test color
concepts and texture possibilities for a
wide range of products like keyboard
covers for surface and various fabrics
and textures on things like hololens and
the well now seemingly discontinued
Microsoft band this tour was awesome and
completely unexpected it was fun to hang
out with Austin and judder for the day
and it didn't end here either
next we checked out
the garage but to find out what that is
you'll have to stay tuned for another
video
do you want a beautiful website that
just works well Squarespace could
probably be for you
they have 24/7 live chat and email
support and it's only 12 bucks a month
and when you sign up for a year you get
a free domain they even all come with
responsive design so whatever you're
viewing it on mobile device console
projector laptop other more different
mobile device whatever it is it will
work just fine also they have commerce
modules if you want to sell something it
can all be integrated through your own
online store which is super cool and you
can now even publish Apple news format
blog posts directly from the Squarespace
blog module which makes it all available
to millions of potential readers which
is great and you can sort of trial with
no credit card required and start
building your website today if you do
decide to sign up for Squarespace make
sure to use our offer code LTT that
could do 10% off your first purchase
thanks for watching guys if this video
suck do you know what to do but if it
was awesome get subscribed hit that like
button and let me know why in the
comments down below I know this was more
of a factory tour kind of thing but we
were completely not ready for that and
didn't have enough time to film on site
so let me know how that went
overall check out the link down below to
see where to buy stuff I guess like
surface and Xbox controllers or
something on Amazon also linked in the
description is our merch store so you
can buy cool shirts like this one and
our community forum where you can talk
about Microsoft's prototyping lab or the
fact that their watch thing is
discontinued and stuff like that if
you're wondering what to watch next
click this it's another one of our
factory tours either the Sennheiser one
or the omron one whoever edits this will
put one of them there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
