I'll be unboxing the imogen studio mr.
robot Oh webcam okay this is a fairly
unique product and their tagline is C
and control your camera from anywhere in
the world featuring motorized tracking
okay so basically what that means is
that you can use the motorized tracking
which goes up to two hundred and five
degrees horizontally and 140 degrees
vertically to remotely view including
with the iphone any video that this
webcam is capturing it captures it up to
1280 by 1024 video and one of the other
things that they say is really
interesting is that it mounts really
easily so you can put it on an LCD
monitor a laptop an old school old
school CRT is one of the things that
says on the side I can't figure out
where that is and yeah they're all
school CRT monitors awesome you can even
mount it next to your cat okay one of
the other things it does is it
automatically tracks your movement and
it has apparently superior low-light
performance now we're going to try the
actual webcam later but for now we're
just going to have a look at this thing
so I mean the killer app is going to be
that it's motorized right so one concern
that I had when I first saw it is that
yeah you get that motorized performance
but you also have to deal with it being
quite large like it's not something
you're realistically here's an iphone
four scales the camera man's iphone it's
not something that you're realistically
going to be using on a laptop okay so
let's see what's included here really
quickly so you've got an image in
studios mr. Roboto okay so there's your
focus ring your microphone and your
power LED all right that's pretty
straightforward it's just an instruction
guide how to get started install the
software connect the camera complete the
software installation and using zedonk a
face you don't like I believe is their
software okay here we go this is the
driver and software installation and
ready for windows XP or vista and almost
anything that works on vista is going to
work on windows 7 so it uses a standard
USB power and data cable here it's
actually quite long so you have pretty
good flexibility in terms
of where you'd like to mount it and I
guess that's pretty much all we can say
about it for now you can sort of play
around with the mounting system a little
bit here you can see it's a little loose
right now but this is apparently going
to adjust both up and down as well as
side to side and I'm definitely going to
have to do a video later showing exactly
how that works but thank you for
checking out the image in studio mr.
