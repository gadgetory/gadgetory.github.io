x100t which quickly became my favorite
walk around point-and-shoot ever thanks
to its large sensor small body size and
excellent fixed lens so I rushed out and
bought the XT 2 because Yolo
but at $700 more canons newer sensor
interchangeable lenses and ease of use
give fuji a shot at the prosumer DSLR
pocket of my gear bag as your
replacement for my old and tired canon
60d let's find out
let's start with the quick physical tour
right off the bat you will notice the
xt2 is practical size advantage over an
average DSLR with a similar lens on the
top of the camera we have the hotshoe
shutter dial ISO dial shutter button and
the exposure compensation dial to the
right of the camera we find the dual SD
card slots a must-have for many working
photographers then on the left of the
camera we have the mic in USB three
micro HDMI and a remote port finally on
the rear of the camera we have a new
3-inch LCD and a fairly standard menu
navigation quick function button layout
with the standout being Fugees addition
of a joystick which allows you to select
focus points very quickly
Fuji's approach of having a physical
dial for every major exposure setting
for the camera is one of these strongest
aspects of their design no need to use a
modifier button or go through a menu and
they can be locked which combined with
the manual aperture ring on most XF
lenses gives you a very satisfying
tactile experience when shooting there
is a level of precision that I can't
quite put into words with this camera
now I've never felt with any other DSLR
I have ever used it's little things like
having such a large exposure
compensation dial making proper exposure
a breeze which gives the shooter more
time to spend on the composition and
timing of the shot looking over the
stills the thing that really surprised
me is Fugees excellent colors even with
the JPEG files you can get from the
camera with a little bit of editing
these photos can really shine on top of
that like many cameras these days you
can send your photos over Wi-Fi direct
to your phone very handy
the excellent image quality of the st2
comes courtesy of bujji's new 24
megapixel x-trans 3 sensor that made its
debut in the x pro 2 that came out a few
months ago detailing each image is sharp
and iso performance is pretty good for
an aps-c camera even up to 6400 ISO the
cameras auto focus is among the fastest
I've ever used in a still camera and
while I am NOT a sports or wildlife
photographer I was impressed by its
speed and accuracy in everyday Street
situation Fuji has added a specific
focusing mode that will allow you to
tailor the autofocus for
you're given situation a nice feature
that has been seen on cameras like Canon
5d Mark for which I reviewed here
usability however is not perfect I found
Fugees 3-inch screen to be a bit
disappointing well I appreciate the
innovation and engineering involved
adding another axis of rotation I didn't
find it comfortable to use even with an
add-on grip and compared to Canon and
Panasonic split Ltd's all I can really
say to Fuji is sometimes it's best not
to reinvent the wheel to be clear it is
not a bad display I just found myself
using the X T 2's built-in EVF much more
it does bring a huge level of certainty
when shooting being able to see what
your shots exposure will look like I
don't know how I could actually go back
to an optical viewfinder at this point
which brings me to video the X t2 is
Fugees first attempt at making a
competitive hybrid video camera and
while it shows promise it definitely has
some first-gen kinks so in camera you
can shoot up to 4k at 30fps or at 1080p
up to 60fps and while the video mode
does not manage to feel like an
afterthought I do have a few grush with
it
the first being that shooting directly
to the SD card the FT 2 can only shoot
in one of its film simulation profiles
which by themselves look fine but limit
your overall dynamic range and your
flexibility in post Fuji has taken the
time to make their own F log profile but
you can only use it with an external
recorder the epilogue footage comes out
noticeably softer than the in-camera
footage but you can add sharpening in
post to balance that out and you are
left with an image that has better
overall highlight retention compared to
the internal files shot to the SD card
adding to the internal video cons by
default the xtq has a record limit of 10
minutes at 4k unless you decide to add
on their battery grip that does more
than just add battery life the grip
increases the overall performance of the
camera from 8 FP s continuous still
shooting to 11 fps and brings the per
clip record time at 4k to 29 minutes and
59 seconds and also as a much-needed
headphone jack for video I can
appreciate Fuji making a battery grip
more useful than just adding power to a
camera but for video shooters this seems
like an essential add-on that comes at a
$330 price pre
that adds weight and height to the
camera making it harder to rig with
other accessories typically needed for a
day of video shooting overall though my
biggest gripe with shooting video on the
XT 2 is the lens options Fuji was kind
enough to lend me their 16 a 55
millimeter and their 52 140 millimeter
which on paper both seemed awesome for
video however I found them really hard
to use with muscle memory
the focus rings on both lenses use an
electronic acceleration curve with a
significant delay instead of the 1 to 1
operation of manual lenses when pulling
focus and autofocus isn't useful beyond
very basic video work which means I was
leaning on my manual lenses during my
testing a lot you cannot punch them to
check your focus while rolling on the
camera which is a total drag when you're
relying on such a small display all is
not lost though if you're a video
shooter you can get a cheap manual
adapter that you lets you use various
manual glass on the XP too but for those
of you who have electronic stills glass
like myself you're out of luck since
there is no electronic adapter currently
available which leads me into my
conclusion is the X key to a perfect
camera no but it is one of the most
enjoyable cameras I have ever used for
Stills it will be my go-to shooter for
portraits moving forward and it also
makes a strong statement that Fuji is
coming after the video enthusiast market
they have some more work to do it would
be nice to get more customizable
profiles or even s log in camera and
Panasonic shouldn't be too worried about
losing their entry-level video pros yet
but it's got a good image and with some
more tuning it can only get better
