pointed the camera in the wrong
direction it may seem that way but in
actuality he's looking for Hawks so you
know scanning the sky all that good
stuff but he would be more likely to
find a hawk if you had a look at the box
that I'm opening up right here
this is the msi gtx 560 TI hawk yes so
this has a few things going for it over
the GTS gtx 560 twin frozen - so if you
remember on the 460 the hawk version of
the card featured a twin froze or two
cooler well the hawk version of the gtx
560 1ups bat and features a twin frozer
three cooler with propeller blades so
msi claims up to 20% more airflow with a
propeller blade versus a standard bladed
fan we also get a copy of Lara Croft and
The Guardian of Light which presumably
is a Tomb Raider game I don't know I
haven't even heard of this game before
okay ready for 3d mark 11 so that means
it is DirectX 11 it has one gig of gddr5
it has oh nice it has me me HDMI mini
HDMI I'm sure is what they meant to say
as well as dual DVI i geforce cuda
nvidia sli PhysX by nvidia nvidia 3d
vision as well as invidious around if
you install to these bad boys three year
warranty and US canada and mexico and
opening up the box we've got all of
those exclusive msi features such as
military class to using tantalum core
capacitors solid capacitors as well as
super ferrite chokes all of which are
designed to stabilize the GPU more make
it last longer and make it run cooler
we've also got triple over voltage by
afterburner this is a hawk exclusive
feature so you can now adjust the
auxilary voltage as well as the port and
memory voltages in afterburner
eight plus one phase pwm design which
delivers more peak current than the gtx
560 TI okay and definitely more than the
reference one so i'm shoot assuming
they're talking about the
five sixty TI Twin Frozr - PS which okay
so you can switch between performance
and silence this is kind of like the
cooler that was on the Intel Extreme
Edition latest generation cooler that
came out with their six cores v
checkpoints which we're used to seeing
on hawk edition card so you can measure
your voltages directly all right so the
Twin Frozr three cooler is a high
density heatsink with propeller blades
uses multiple heat pipes a nickel plated
copper base as well as a direct contact
design here we go so they're saying it
absolutely smokes the reference cooler
which it probably does because the Twin
Frozr series of coolers has an excellent
reputation for utterly demolishing any
reference cooler that you will find on
pretty much any graphics card alright in
terms of accessories we have a couple
dual molex to 6-pin PCI II adapters just
in case you need them we've got our V
check point tables so you can plug those
into the board and then you can plug
your multimeter in here find out what
your voltages are running at I'm gonna
lift this out have a look at what we've
got in terms of games you know what I
actually don't have this game so I'm not
gonna give this away I'm gonna try it
it's a hopefully a steam download
because if it's not it's probably too
much work for me to bother alright next
we have a quick user's guide drivers
disk which you shouldn't use we've got I
don't know some other piece of paper a
mini H mini HDMI to HDMI adapter as well
as a DVI to VGA adapter I'm just teasing
the boys over at MSI and girls at MSI
I'm sure that was a very innocent typo
and they don't actually think that it's
spelled meanie so let's go ahead open up
this package here there we go there we
go
there's a truck bill in vine so we're
not even gonna try and talk all right
let's get the plastic off here gotta
love the outdoor unboxings I know a lot
of you don't love the outdoor unboxing
but frankly I don't really care if I
like them chance to get out of the
office for a little while not to mention
the excellent natural light that lends
itself well to video log or videography
alright just gonna finish taking off
this plastic having a little bit of
trouble there plastic all right there we
go this is the twin frozer 3 so as you
can see we've got the dual 80 millimeter
propeller blade fans we've bought a
high-density heatsink fin arrangement oK
we've talked about that plenty before
that's interesting they did not call out
the super pipes on this card so normally
they call out their super pipes so we've
got one and two incredibly thick heat
pipes that are designed you can see
those are the ones that carry the heat
furthest away from the GPU so they are
more efficient than the thinner heat
pipes because they have to carry the
heat out away further you can see the
PCB is stamped MSI Hawk version 1.2
the reason it's stamped in the Seahawk
and not NVIDIA reference is that it is a
completely custom PCB that is how msi
builds in the functionality of the
auxilary over voltage there v check
points as well as more pieces of PWM to
deliver cleaner power to your GPU for
better overclocking back here we've got
our V check points so we've got one for
the GPU one for the memory and one for
the PLL okay here we've got our dual 6
pin PCI II power connectors and then
this is another feature that they did
not talk about it all on the packaging
but this brace right here this prevents
the GPU from flexing when you have a
heavy cooler installed such as a twin
frozer three cooler so what that means
is that when you is okay basically when
you install your graphics card in your
system it's supported only by these
screws and the slot itself so what
happens is a lot of the time if you put
a heavy cooler on it
the board will flex down from the weight
well then
to add some extra rigidity to the board
because you can see it's bolted in right
here to the screws that go into your
case and gives it some more some more a
more solid overall mount into your
chassis okay so we've covered that let's
have a look at the back of the PCB
itself where we are using spring-loaded
screws to mount the Twin Frozr three
cooler we've also got a standard PCI
Express 16x interface which were pretty
much used to seeing at this point on
graphics cards one sli finger so that is
2-way SLI ready but not 3-way or
four-way SLI ready that is a limitation
of the GTX 560 GF 114 whatever it's
called thing gf 114 GPU here we've got a
BIOS which that's kind of cool so you
can switch between bios's and then I
actually don't know what that is if you
guys know what this is let me know it
looks like a fan header to me but I
could be wrong in fact I'm pretty sure
I'm wrong because I'd be only three pins
like hold on let me see if the PCB is
labeled and I just can't see it
so there's performance oh here we go oh
no this is not a BIOS switch it's for
performance silent and and one other
mode that's not very well labeled you
can see the labels are actually down
here under the switch performance
silence and reserved okay and then this
is something to do with the BIOS it's
labeled J BIOS so guys feel free to
leave a comment and let me know what you
guys think it is
here we go at the back you can see that
there's gonna be a little bit of
external exhaust from the Twin Frozr 3
but I would not I would definitely not
rely on that to do the bulk of your
cooling so you're gonna be kicking out a
fair bit of heat into your case that's
just the reality of these higher
performance coolers you better have a
high performance case that's prepared to
move the heat out here's our dual DVIs
as well as our me me HDMI and I think
that's pretty much everything I have to
say about the Twin Frozr 3 Hawk GTX 560
Ti don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos
and thanks to msi for providing us with
the gtx 560 TI to check out looks pretty
sweet especially in the sun it's all
shiny and stuff and now we're looking
for Hawks up there again way to go care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
