unboxing of the gigabyte H 67 a UD 3 H
it has a three year warranty as you may
or may not have noticed it supports
Intel Core series processors on LGA 1155
and it uses the age 67 chipset so that
means it supports turbo boost but it
does not support overclocking on
unlocked CPUs and it does not support
turning up turbo CPUs past their default
turbo mode so I'm sorry if that's
confusing but that's really the best I
can do with it it is compatible with
core i5s but it is also compatible with
core i7s which the only difference is
they have more cache and they feature
hyper threading and when we have Intel
Core i3 s on their second-generation
core series processors it'll likely
support those two up here there's a
little note LGA 1155 CPU only that is a
hundred percent correct if you try and
put in LGA 1156 CPU in this board bad
things will happen none of them good
okay we have ultra-durable three which
means we have the 2x copper PCB four you
know better heat dissipation more
conductivity all that good stuff we also
have gigabytes three three three concept
although the sticker appears to be
missing from the box so USB 3.0 which is
fast USB power 3x which is a cool
feature because it allows you to use a
hub on any one of the USB ports on this
board and plug in three times as much
power draw as you would be able to
normally do with a hub so that's kind of
neat okay we have SATA 3.0 which is good
and over here we have on/off charge
which means that even when your system
is powered off you can charge devices
such as say for example your iPhone and
what other relevant stuff do we have ooh
dual BIOS so it's very very difficult to
wreck your board by corrupting the BIOS
it also apparently supports ATI
crossfire X technology although I can
imagine it's not an ideal configuration
with an h-60 7 chipset board here is a
big big warning yeah we had a little
tiny one on the front of the box but
this is more appropriate 1155 CPUs not
1156 CPUs X No okay we have a user's
manual that also includes a utility and
driver DVD download the latest
off the Gigabyte website um cameraman is
blocking most of our light at that
angles and a little bit there we go we
have a color coded i/o shield we have a
multilingual installation guidebook
which is going to show you basic things
like installing a CPU installing Ram we
have two right angle and two straight
SATA cables we have a Dolby home theater
sticker my understanding is this is
quite an expensive sticker and then we
also have a gigabyte powered sticker
that one is less expensive let me tell
you guys a lot of motherboards over the
last couple years I have never seen a
piece of foam stuck in between the
MOSFET heatsink oh I see why well that's
not on there very well at all is it okay
so this is in here to prevent it from
wiggling around during shipping I mean
here have a look okay so let's start
let's start with that since that seems
like a bit of a concern but it's
probably fine so we're using plastic
pushpins here and then what appears to
be like a softer style of thermal
interface material under this so you can
see there's actually a very small
contact point where this this large
heatsink is making contact with the VRMs
so in order to make sure that it stays
straight during shipping we got the
phone but while the system is running
that's gonna melt a little bit and it's
gonna be on there pretty good I don't
think you're gonna have to worry about
burning out your VRMs so the same goes
for the one up here it looks like this
uses one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten looks like it uses eight
plus two phase power for the LGA 1155
CPU and unlike most eight series chipset
boards this is a full ATX board so we
have support for our CPU here we have
our eight pin power connector in its
ideal location at the top left of the
board we have full support for dual
channel ddr3 we have our 24 pin power
connector along the right hand edge of
the board here is our Intel welp South
Bridge to use an archaic term but are in
I believe is called an IO hub now which
controls things like SATA ports USB
ports all of that good stuff and then we
also have our front panel connectors wow
that's a lot of USB ports that's five
front panel USB headers outstanding so
you can hook up ten front USB ports on
your case if it actually has that many
here we have seven expansion slots three
PCI which is appropriate for an H series
chipset board because you can't expect
value chipset board buyer to be
necessarily running the very latest
technology couple of firewire headers
we've got two PCIe 1x slot and then two
PCIe 16x slots now officially this board
supports SLI although I really wouldn't
recommend running SLI because you can
see right here even though this is a 16
X physical slot which has enough spaces
in here for PCIe 8 X hopefully you can
see can you see the actual metal contact
pins in there okay well the metal
contact pins only go up to here so
that's only a 4x electrical slot now
while I usually tell viewers 8 X + 8 X
is fine for crossfire or SLI 16 X + 4 X
is probably not quite ideal especially
because these four lanes are running off
the i/o hub over here rather than
running off of the PCIe controller
that's directly off the chipset because
H 67 is not capable of splitting into
8x8 X so it's a full 16 X here and only
4 X here
here's your front panel audio connector
this this location for it from gigabyte
will always baffle me everyone else in
their dog puts it down here but usually
I don't use the front panel header
anyhow here on the back of the board we
will find some connectors which are
conveniently covered so I can't see what
they are oh wow we have every display
connector Under the Sun I think but
let's start over here we've got a ps2
keyboard mouse combo port we've got 1 2
3 4 USB 2.0 ports that explains why
there were so many on the board itself
we have VGA DVI DisplayPort and HDMI yes
the whole shebang and then we also have
optical audio out we've got firewire as
well as eSATA on the back of the board
we have 2 USB 3.0 ports Gigabit Ethernet
and
7.1 audio out thank you for checking out
