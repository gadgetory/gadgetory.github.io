by D brand their grip case and prism
screen protector give you 360 degree
protection for your phone check them out
at the link in the video description so
we're here at Acer where they're showing
off some gaming notebooks they're
showing off the new Swift 7 which is the
same thinness as the old one but
significantly smaller so it's still got
a Y class processor it's still super
thin 10 hour battery life dual-core
hyper-threaded it's still a little
flimsier than I'd like and it's still
very expensive and what was it $1,700 or
something along those lines and then to
go with the thinnest lightest notebook
they've ever made they've got this this
is the aptly named thoroughness arguably
the biggest heaviest desktop ever made
so this entire thing is actually one
package there is a single SKU it costs
$10,000 but whoa hold on that actually
isn't as crazy expensive as you might
initially think and in fact the first
thing that both I and Colton said when
we walked in was like oh that's it
because there is a lot of stuff here so
first of all you get yourself a predator
or Ryan desktops this is there 9,000
desktop it comes with it's a pretty good
spec but not an over-the-top spec that's
included in the 10,000 dollar unit so
you got two 8700 K I believe it's 32
gigs of ram does that sound about right
you got your 512 gigas SD 2 terabyte
hard drive what's that 64 gigs around
who's keeping track at this point oh
RTX 2080 Ti so very capable little
gaming machine alright you get a full
set of Acer predator gaming peripherals
keyboard mouse you got your headset you
got this special shaped mousepad that
goes with this you know arm that closes
in on you you get three Acer predator
gaming monitors so these are 27-inch 144
Hertz 2560 by 1440 monitors they're
running in NVIDIA surround whatever
Nvidia is calling that these days and
you get
so acer is only selling this with what
they're calling White Glove service
which is to say that when you buy a
throne Asst someone will come to your
house spend probably upwards of two
hours assembling it for you wherever it
is that you choose to plunk it down and
by the way you won't be moving it after
because it weighs well over 500 pounds
and you will be treated to not just the
most deluxe gaming chair that I have
ever been in it will be a motorized one
so the first thing you need to do is get
your RGB adjusted to whatever is
comfortable for you I'm partial to
orange I'm gonna go ahead and do that
then you grab this remote right here
which controls not just the rumble in
the seat so there's actually a couple of
subwoofers built into the seat that will
just detect any low frequency sound in
your game or movie or whatever else it
is and vibrate along your back and along
your butt crack but you also get to
adjust check this out oh no now that is
all this one does nevermind so it's got
a separate remote that's built in right
here that you can use to do this open
hold on ah to do this so it closes the
keyboard now straight I got to give it a
little help this is pre-production still
it's not shipping till q2 sometimes
something along those lines closes the
arm and then there's actually a couple
of other things here that I can adjust
as well so I'm gonna go ahead and throw
my headset on and I'm gonna raise of the
pedals so this lifts up my feet and this
buddy is supposed to pop up here I think
come on there buddy
hey pre-production like I said it's a
come on pedal rise
do you mind showing me how you got this
to come up before
oh okay wrong button then finally this
is the last trick what they're calling
0g so it lifts up your legs and tilts
the whole thing back now you don't have
to go all the way back and in fact I
would say there is at least a small risk
of your keyboard kind of accidentally
following on you if you don't secure it
back here something figure out some way
to cable manage that and in fact every
part of it is no I wouldn't say
infinitely adjustable but very
adjustable so you can raise the arms a
little bit if your eye lines a little
bit higher so this is it you are
immersed in your gaming cockpit you've
got your cupholders you've got your USB
hub over here so you plug in a thumb
drive or whatever else it is you want
you've got a controller pouch down here
that you can keep your I don't know your
 on your xbox game controller or
whatever else in I mean what more could
you ask for this type of thing is sure
to impress the ladies and like I said
all of this for just ten thousand
dollars including coming to assemble it
for you now if you guys are anything
like me you're probably asking yourself
at this point fly why is a sir building
this this is so far outside of their
typical product lineup and the best
answer that I could get because unlike
what I would have expected with a
product like this where I would have
seen a brand trying to make you know
five thousand dollars a unit because
this is going to be obviously a low
volume item they seem to be taking a
very similar approach to the margin of
this product based on what I know about
how much it costs to do this kind of
thing as they would even on like a
typical gaming notebook so the best
answer that I can get out of them is
that this is a statement piece this is
the kind of thing that they want to be a
draw in retail stores or in
entertainment centers or wherever else
where people are going to be exposed to
the predator brand and thing
you know what predator yeah gaming like
hardcore gaming and if that's the goal
then as far as I'm concerned
mission accomplished Acer mission
accomplished
that's not really a recommendation to
buy one but it's definitely
attention-grabbing
speaking of attention-grabbing
can I just grab your attention for a
minute tell you about our sponsor d Brad
D brands grip cases super grippy it's
got their extra clickable buttons and
like anything D brand its customizable
so you can change out this marble back
that I've got on mine with Dragon Skin
or any color you want they're all true
textured authentic 3m vinyl and they are
cut with the precision that you'd expect
from D brand actually that goes for
their grip cases as well including their
cutouts for fingerprint sensors cameras
etc and then on the front of the phone
they've got their new prism screen
protectors these things are absolutely
nuts
the demo you guys are looking at right
now is absolutely real so they've got
this cool applicator that you use to put
their screen protector on so you get a
perfect fit every time and then once
it's on it kind of it feels like glass
on the front but it's not because you
can take it and smack a nail into a
piece of wood with the front of your
phone peel the thing off and the screen
is still pristine I haven't seen impact
protection like this from a third-party
product ever before and you guys can
check out both the grip and the prism to
protect your phone 360 degrees at the
link in the video description so thanks
