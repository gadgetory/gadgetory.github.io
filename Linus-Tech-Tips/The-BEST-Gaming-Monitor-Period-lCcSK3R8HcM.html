how long it takes groundbreaking new
technology to be commercialized this is
one of the first 4k 144 Hertz
HDR monitors on the planet and even
though we've had 4k monitors for over
five years and fast refresh rates are
even longer than that and the bandwidth
to push all of those pixels
since DisplayPort 1.4 was ratified in
2016 and even though we saw this thing
running beautifully at CES one and a
half years ago it is only now finally in
our shop for review so then after all
that waiting is the PG 27 UQ even worth
the $2,000 price tag or is it still too
far ahead of its time
o time it's time to tell you about our
sponsor Corsairs vengeance RGB Pro
Series overclocked memory utilizes
dynamic multi-zone RGB lighting to light
up your rig check it out at the link in
the video description
let's jump right into the meat of the
specs starting with the resolution its
4k 3840 by 2160 which as we all know
looks great at 27 inches it's not quite
what I guess Apple would define as
retina but it is pretty darn close it's
also a quantum dot display which gives
it more saturated but more accurate and
more brighter colors than a regular LCD
allowing it to achieve over 90% coverage
of the DCI p3 color gamut
now this monitor is marketed at gamers
but because of that it could easily be
used for color critical tasks on a
professional workstation mmm delicious
cake that I can both have and tape I
have and how much of it are eight for me
of course a lot of these qualities are
closely related to the next big buzzword
on the box
HDR a good HDR display needs two things
one lots of color data and to lots of
brightness and the PG 27 UQ has both
fruit n bit color so no 8-bit Plus FRC
baloney and 1000 nits peak brightness
which it can hit in any of its 384 zones
that's the same number of full array
local dimming zones as the Nvidia BFG
display that we saw at C yes but since
this is only a 27-inch monitor the zones
are way smaller at under an inch square
so you don't get nearly the same halo
effect around bright objects on dark
backgrounds but we've seen 4k HDR
monitors before but what makes this
monitor really special is the high
refresh rate up to a hundred and
forty-four Hertz that is if you can
manage to push the frame rates of your
games that high 4k monitors are tough to
drive even at 60 Hertz
and 44 well this is where the cherry on
top of all of those specs we already
told you about g-sync
is supposed to come in handy since the
most dramatic tearing and juddering
happens when you're running between 40
and 60 frames per second g-sync
smooths out those wrinkles significantly
so then it's basically perfect god of
monitors no compromises go buy one now
right hold on there's actually been some
controversy around the PG 27 uq and it's
acer cousin that uses the same auo panel
and gsync module it turns out that
DisplayPort 1.4 uses the same
transmission mode as 1.3 which is capped
out at 32 point four gigabit per second
or 4k at 120 Hertz not 144 DisplayPort
1.4 adds support for a technology called
display stream compression which allows
it to send extra color information so 4k
120 with 4 4 4 chroma and HDR what that
means
in a nutshell is that in order to
refresh at a hundred and forty four
Hertz you actually have to overclock the
monitor using the on-screen display this
instructs the system to free up
bandwidth by reducing color information
down to a chroma subsampling ratio of
four to two now in real people speak is
that something you're gonna notice in
games probably not unless you were
running two systems side by side and
really looking for it with a trained eye
I mean chroma subsampling is commonly
used in the movie industry but it is
noticeable with text on top of a flat
color which for PC use is pretty common
I mean just look at the last two rows
here the good news is that if you turn
the refresh rate back down to 120 the
effect goes away but some buyers were
still upset because damn it the box says
144 Hertz and it cost more than Linus's
car and that is a fair point
but at least the exterior of the display
should make most gamers pretty happy
it's got an unapologetically game relook
with all sorts of aggressive lines
projecting LEDs and I mean why not
a gigantic RS ink compatible RGB badge
on the back it's a thick monitor with
chunky vessels I mean not that you were
going to be able to drive more than one
of them at the same time anyway or
afford more than one of them and it
consumes up to 75 watts as measured from
the wall with a very robust stand that
offers lots of movement in all the
relevant axes okay got all that stuff
out of the way so back to should you buy
this monitor you might have noticed that
there's still a lot of video left to
watch that's because it's kind of a
complicated answer for the sightseeing
triple-a gamer
we could just say well which are three
running at ultra settings on 4k or Deus
Ex with HDR turned on they look utterly
fantastic and call it a day but you're
only gonna get about 50 fps and that's
definitely playable it's a good
experience problem is there are many
cheaper monitors out there that can do
that even with a Titan V and all the
settings cranked down at 4k these kinds
of games still only hit around seventy
to a hundred frames per second so if you
wanted to play demanding triple-a titles
at 4k 144 FPS well based on our back of
napkin analysis of GPU performance and
release trends over the last few years
it looks like you're gonna have to wait
two maybe even three generations of
graphics cards we're talking three to
five years before you could fully take
advantage of the PG 27 uqs capabilities
and do you think that a monitor of this
caliber is still going to cost to brand
in 2022 probably not but that's not to
say that you can't enjoy all of its
benefits together today let's turn our
focus to the eSports gamer again with a
Titan V we were able to easily
110 FPS out of rocket League at highest
quality and on fortnight we hovered in
the 110 to 125 FPS range using the high
preset but with the view distance turned
up to epic and anti-aliasing turned down
to fxaa
so not quite full epic settings but it
still looks amazing as for weather looks
amazing is a strong enough selling point
for a competitive player to spend over
three times as much on a monitor that's
a little tougher because at the end of
the day this thing is still running a
lower refresh rate than a 240 Hertz 1080
p PG 258 q or even a 165 Hertz 1440 PPG
278 q are so they would be trading some
of their compete level for eye candy so
what all of that means for now is that
in our minds the PG 27 u q is more toy
than tool for Portability and
competitiveness reasons it's impractical
for serious eSports gaming so if you're
the kind of person who gravitates
towards the tricked-out Miata this thing
isn't the fastest quarter-mile per
dollar but that doesn't mean that no one
should buy it gaming on it is in a word
luxurious so if you're more of a Model X
type person who wants damn near the best
of everything and is willing to spend
more to go really fast in style well I
think it's fair to say that this monitor
is the most versatile full bells and
whistles model we have ever seen at
least it will be until AU Optronics
unveils the rumored 32 inch buyers or
more special version of this panel next
