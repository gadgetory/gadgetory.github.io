videos I've been meaning to do for a
while this is going to be how to update
your motherboard BIOS by Linus we're
going to start with gigabyte as my first
bios update video and step one go to
gigabyte comm manufacturer website step
two click support and downloads step
three go to downloads and search for the
name of your board in this case it is
the Snooper sniper now I'm still using
the shipping BIOS on this board so
anything I choose will be an upgrade bio
so there's a couple ones available we've
got F 1 which is the first release no
need to download and reflash that we've
got F 2 which is the latest release bios
and then we've got a beta bio so I'm not
going to be using a beta bios
so I am going to use the latest release
bios I'm going to ship that somewhere ok
in this case why don't I save it to just
straight downloads and we'll go from
there
ok so it's a small file because it's not
an EFI BIOS we're going to extract it to
a particular folder here that's left
that slash that's that BIOS then we're
going to go there here we are find that
and we are going to really yeah would
you think that would work
ok so then we're going to take that file
and we are going to copy it to a USB
Drive so I'm just going to grab a USB
drive here
my trusty Patriot rage plug that into
any USB port on the back of the PC use
this one there we go
so that's plugged in now I'm going to
take the BIOS file right here I'm going
to cut that I'm going to throw it just
into the root of my Patriot Drive
alright I'm going to restart the
computer
and show you guys how to update from the
f1 BIOS to the f2 BIOS I wasn't planning
to do this in real time I was going to
cut the video up and do steps but it's
taking so little time that I might go
just this way haha end so there you
press n to get into cue flash I think I
are you press Delete enter setup so
it'll just be a moment
well it looks like I can also get into
cue flash from here by pressing f8 enter
the few flash utility yes I would like
to update files from Drive I will be
using this I will be scrolling down to
the BIOS file and then I will be yes I'm
sure
now I highly recommend having your
computer plugged in to a UPS while you
are doing a BIOS flash because should
there be a power outage right now I'll
let me just check I don't believe this
board features dual BIOS so though ICO
it does ok so it features dual BIOS so
even if there's a power outage in theory
there should be a no no long term
problem my system I would just be able
to reflash the BIOS but if you have a
single BIOS board then that could be a
real issue for you so press any key to
continue and that was it
so now we'll go back into Windows and
I'll show you guys how to confirm I've
noticed the fact that when flashing your
BIOS you will usually overwrite any
settings that have been entered into it
such as overclocking settings turning
off the splash screen when it boots all
that kind of stuff and also I should
note that you should always have your
system set to the default settings not
overclocked when you are going to flash
the BIOS to avoid any kind of
instability during the BIOS flashing
process that would cause it to ever out
now we'll use CPU Z to verify that my
flash was successful you can see I am
now using version f2 of the BIOS which
was released on March 29th 2011 so there
you go thank you for checking out my
bass update guide don't forget to
