was no small challenge getting it out of
the box I did promise more of an
in-depth look at this particular headset
so the first thing i want to touch on
you've already seen the unboxing i hope
if you hadn't been go watch it now but
the first thing i want to touch on is
the overall comfort of this headset even
when using it for an extended period of
time with earrings or I had a friend who
has pretty large leash really long ears
so even if you have your regularly
shaped years or earrings they're
extremely comfortable to wear for a long
period of time because the earpads are
so big also at the top of the headset
it's quite puffy and padded and it is
completely adjustable for a variety of
different head sizes and really you know
what comfort is probably the first thing
that was on Corsairs list when they were
designing this headset because it should
fit almost anyone very very comfortably
for extended periods of time another
thing i want to touch on is the overall
build quality of the HS one you can see
Corsair starts with a very nicely
braided cable that's going to be snag
free you're not going to have any
trouble with it getting caught on things
and you shouldn't have any trouble even
if actually I have a couple cats as some
of my viewers may or may not know and I
found that with braided cables such as
this one they have a lot less success
chewing through them quickly then with
the non braided cables that were on a
pair of sennheiser pc 350's rest in
peace that no longer function due to a
broken cord now this works extremely
well when the microphone is on the
lights behind the buttons are actually
blue and when your microphone is off the
lights are orange which is a great
feature because for a gamer you can
quickly glance aww did I hit my
microphone button when no one can hear
you and you can see without actually
fumbling around with anything whether
your microphone is off moving our way up
we have more braided cable we have a
very robust place where it joins the
left earphone and then we have some
incredibly strong feeling hinges here so
these are capable of folding down like
this for travel they're capable of
rotating I'm
great degree in either direction well
only great degree in this direction and
then just a little bit in the other
direction you can see that while they
have metal caps on them they're actually
large plastic ball and socket joints
just like that just like your shoulder
okay and those feel very robust there's
pretty much no likelihood that those
would be damaged in the useful life time
of this of a product like this and
moving up the product we've got the
pleather e covering that's over the top
of the head band which is once again
well stitched it doesn't look like it's
going to come apart in any way overall
the build quality is such that i would
feel confident dropping them on the
floor and they will still work I did run
in tests that they do still work in case
anyone was wondering software-wise the
HS one is a USB only headset which might
be a bit of a deterrent for some people
because you are going to be limited by
the chipset courser is using in the
headset itself you can't go ahead and
plug it into a dedicated headphone amp
or into an audio receiver which is what
I normally do with headsets and you are
going to be limited to the audio
software that Corsair uses you can't go
and just switch your sound card there's
a built-in sound card but that can be
very convenient for people like laptop
users where you're stuck with what is
usually a terrible onboard audio
solution and anything is an upgrade so
something like a USB headset that is
powered and run off the USB port and
often integrated audio chipset is very
much preferable microphone recording
quality was excellent and I did play
around with their voice effects feature
which suggests that you modify your
voice to amuse or terrifying your
friends when playing games are making
skype calls and the the high setting
wasn't actually all that amusing it was
just kind of chipmunky but the low
setting was pretty creepy and my voice
sounded very different very very creepy
so that microphone is definitely a big
plus on this headset now let's get into
the audio quality a little bit for games
it was terrific I was able to pinpoint
footsteps which is the most important
for any serious FPS gamer and what I
found to was that the base is not
overwhelming so if there's an explosion
nearby or some other kind of deep noise
it's not going to completely overdue
itself and drown out everything else but
what that also means is that it's at a
bit of a disadvantage for music I found
that the onboard chipset didn't do the
greatest job of maintaining a level
volume throughout the highs mids and
lows of a music track and it also didn't
really reach a desirable loudness level
on some tracks but with others by the
time I turn the volume up to the max it
was pretty much unbearable to listen to
so there was a little bit of
inconsistency to it but I think that's
the kind of thing that can be addressed
with driver updates overall it does what
it's advertised to do it's great for
gaming you have the convenience of being
able to plug in x USB to any computer
and get a consistent audio experience
which is something that you can't get if
you're using onboard audio on a
motherboard or especially on a laptop
where most of the audio solutions are
frankly just terrible so in conclusion
the HS one does exactly what it's
advertised to do it performs very well
for games it has lots of great
convenient features that are optimized
you guessed it for gamers such as the
color changing volume buttons the USB
port the excellent Mike it's very well
built which is again a great feature for
gamers who are yeah yeah they're likely
to drop their headset or spill Pepsi on
it or whatever else can possibly happen
I wouldn't expect it to damage the HS 1
in the slightest overall Corsairs put
together a pretty good package here and
I just want to give them a big thanks
for sending the HS one for my unboxing
and review pleasure and you're watching
pleasure thank you for checking out my
video review I suppose of the HS 1 and
