our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys here in the end acai sweet we've
got what was I thought was a pretty cool
little demo you have a bit of a history
of the MSI twin frozr series cooler so
this is the twin frozen it looks like a
dog quite frankly sorry man yeah twin
frozr too and it looks it added more
dense fins and it well performed a
little better okay twin frozr three ads
propeller blades so here we're actually
improving the performance of the cooler
over the previous generation products in
addition to again looking better and
twin frozr for alex from emphasize
joining us why don't you tell us what
you guys added with twin frozen four
which is the current generation twin
frozen turn frozen four actually a
slightly different design on the shroud
lil bit more aggressive but the biggest
change was we added a the dust removal
of technology which is allows the fans
to spin backwards on system startup and
the biggest thing is is that every
generation of Trinity falls where we
keep adding something to the designers
of graphics card to improve and in
reality if you're buying at to and fro
serious graphics cards you're not paying
for anything extra like a special
technology whatever we just keep adding
something to it from our previous
generation okay so tell us about this
system over here so this features msi
technology inside it this is an ITX
gaming machine what the heck is this
thing this is actually but done by one
of our partners I by power this is the
boat chassis it's a mini ITX based
system very small as you can see very
compact the system is sending up right
but you can also send it you send on its
side and it's got a full size gtx 680
graphics card inside along with a custom
and can actually see that right there
yeah you can actually see it uses a PCIe
bridge to have the graphics card mounted
on the side that's very very cool so I
want to give you an angle of the back of
it here sort of so you can see that the
motherboard and the graphics card are
mounted in sort of a sort of a strange
way so they
design this chassis to be used with a
bridge and it you pretty much can't
install a graphics card in it without
that then I suppose yes very cool okay
and what's that other system you've got
over there past the MSI mechanical
keyboards yo the man mess I mechanical
keyboards but this is the cooler master
half X piece taste warmer for like an
open bench kind of testing but the
inside we have our z77 mPower
motherboard as well as a gtx 680 like
graphics card and also the effects here
empower edition memory kit and of
interest is that all these three
components match color wise you're all
black sync with the yellow accents and
very clean system setup I mean this is
if you're building empower based z77
mPower based system this is how you want
to set it up yeah this looks this looks
gorgeous actually I'm gonna tweet that
right now so next we're gonna do the MSI
system section of their booth now I did
make a slight mistake we're not going to
see systems just yet we're going to wrap
up with a few motherboards on the
component side then remove over to
system is going to be a separate video
so what do you guys got here we've got a
z77 ITX we've got a value z77 board that
has Thunderbolt on board and tell us
about this guy right here in the middle
this is actually a z77 not z77 this is
actually x79 sorry gaming motherboard
this is going to be the x79 a GD 45
gaming the name actually might not be
gaming when it's announced up for the
time being it's it's being called gaming
it's a refresh of the x79 platform in
advance of a new processor that's coming
out towards the middle of this year 2013
and not that you can give us any details
on that right now not that I can give
you any details but you can use your
imagination as to what the next version
of the code name for socket 2011 CPU is
concerned but it is a new color scheme
and it's going to be one of several
refresh boards that we will have for the
X 89 chipset ok so guys don't forget
don't miss any of our coverage of CES
2013 and as always don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips thanks for
