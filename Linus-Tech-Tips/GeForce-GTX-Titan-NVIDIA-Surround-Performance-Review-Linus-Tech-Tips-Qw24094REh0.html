high-resolution gaming such as the kind
that you would do if you had triple
monitors so our triple monitor setup for
testing Titan was actually three 1920 by
1200 monitors so for all intents and
purposes our results are going to be
pretty similar to what you'd see running
3 1080p monitors it's a little bit more
demanding but you can kind of
extrapolate down a little bit it gives
you some idea how this solution is gonna
perform so the Titans main advantage
when running high resolution is that it
has 6 gigs of video memory so that's in
addition to the 2500 some-odd CUDA cores
the large 7.1 billion transistor GPU and
just generally overall beast design ours
ran at one point 1 3 gigahertz or so
consistently with GPU boost that's on
air cooling with water cooling it'll do
more so it's got a lot going for it but
what it doesn't have going for it is the
fact that it is only one GPU and it does
have to go up against competing dual GPU
solutions so the main contenders for
this one actually will all the solutions
that we ran were the GTX Titan the a
seuss Ares 2 so this is a dual 7970
gigahertz Edition card that actually is
a very very very custom card very
expensive but we used that to represent
7970 crossfire as well as just sort of
that you know what graphics card out
there actually costs more than a Titan
well this one and you know see how see
how those stack up against each other we
ran a single 7970 with its three gigs of
video memory 7970 Alphin all open often
gets recommended over gtx 680 for
surround setups and last but not least
we ran two gtx 660ti in sli to see how
these are 2 gig cards only to see how
those stack up just having more GPU
power and actually last that one wasn't
last we ran a GTX 680 so that's a three
gig card so that gives us some idea how
that rather 2 gig card excuse me so that
gives us some idea how
it's still high-performance similar to a
7970 but more frame buffer limited cards
will perform so without further ado oh
this is all on our 3930k at 4 gigahertz
test bench with 16 gigs of ram and all
cards are overclocked you can find the
card over clocks in the shared Google
document that I share so that you guys
can see what our cards are clocked at
they're all at very reasonable clocks
that should be attainable by you pretty
much pretty easily alright so let's
start with Crysis can it run Crysis
hahahaha the joke that never gets old on
the Internet until it takes an arrow to
the knee and dies or retires or does
whatever it does that's that's funny
right and planking planking is still
funny I don't know forget about it
so crisis ok advantage Ares to the Ares
2 absolutely walks away with Crysis
Crysis is an older game so the textures
are not as not high resolution enough
that Titan would benefit from its six
gigs of video memory so areas to goes
yeah ok we want more GPU horsepower also
excellent crossfire scaling helps the
areas to perform more than twice as well
as a 79 70 something that early on in my
crossfire testing days I would have said
oh that's that's an anomaly there's no
way that can be possible you know what
sometimes it actually happens it's very
very bizarre so for single GPU solutions
680 and 7970 are pretty close again no
advantage for the 7970 with its 3
gigabyte frame buffer but the titan
leaves them both behind outperforming
them both by about 50% 660ti sli
demonstrates why sometimes a dual GPU
solution is not a great one so while
titan may be very expensive sometimes it
can be worthwhile to run a single GPU
because driver issues can force an
otherwise theoretically more powerful
solution to not really do very well now
we just saw Crysis 3 launch so we also
ran Crysis 3 where Titan stole the show
so Titan outperformed everything else in
Crysis 3 including the 660ti is in sli
although it should be noted that 660ti
is in sli are significantly less
expensive than a Titan destroyed the GTX
680 destroyed the Ares 2 which actually
performed worse than the 7970 so this is
an example where 660ti
demonstrated that it's all about drivers
so on our previous game Crysis 1 AMD
benefited from dual GPU while Nvidia
didn't at all and in Crysis 3 Nvidia
benefits from dual GPU at 57 60 by 1080
or rather by 1200 well whereas AMD
doesn't at all so it comes down to the
individual games you're going to play
whereas a single GPU solution always
performs well and we see that with the
Titan Far Cry 3 another hot title Ares 2
just runs away with this one Far Cry 3
generally runs better on AMD cards and
that trend continued and nothing really
unexpected here it performs almost twice
as fast as a single 7970 and it takes
the gtx 660ti in sli to even I mean
they're not even close
gtx 660ti in sli low are only slightly
faster than a Titan which is
significantly faster than GTX 680 and
7970 but you can see the AMD
optimizations that have gone into this
particular game Skyrim was an
interesting one this is a bit of a
challenge with surround gaming in
general game support is not always there
even for games that are extremely model
so Skyrim is is very model our our stock
test configuration for Skyrim has 18
mods installed from Steam Workshop but
it didn't actually work on either our
Nvidia or our AMD test platforms to get
it going and surround there was there
was a patch that used to work but then
there's a newer patch of Skyrim now it
doesn't work anymore so I'm really
excited about 4k displays one to help us
really push these GPUs because that's
even higher resolution than 3 by 1080
and the other is the fact that we don't
have to deal with surround to get just
super high resolution images and higher
pixel densities another good thing as
well moving right along to battlefield 3
Titan steals the show again just
narrowly edging out 660ti sli by about
5% which beat Ares 2 as well so this is
a game that sort of like Far Cry 3 was
for AMD this one favors Nvidia pretty
immensely so GTX 680 walks all over 70
970
and then the dual GPU solutions actually
do the same thing to each other that the
single GPU solutions did to each other
with only the Titan sort of emerging on
top and I mean you look at the GPU that
the dual GPU scaling actually AMD scales
well but didn't have great performance
to begin with whereas nvidia didn't
scale quite as well but had better
performance to begin with next up is
Metro 2033 which is the first game where
we really see the higher frame buffer
GPUs pull away from the lower frame
buffer GPUs so the 680 and the 660ti
both look like they ran out of memory
because the performance just falls off a
cliff compared to where they were
hanging with their equivalent solutions
throughout most of our testing so while
we don't necessarily need all six gigs
that you have on the Titan for this
particular bench it does show that there
are modern games or even older games
that at higher resolutions like when 4k
display start showing up will benefit
from more memory so yeah three gigs is
is enough for this particular game but
what if we did scale to 4k what if you
know what if an upcoming title scales to
4k maybe six gigs will be needed in the
near future
especially if you want to run at the
very very highest details I mean I guess
needed is sort of a strong word but
anyway in this one Ares two steals the
show Titan comes in exactly where it
belongs and moving on to witcher 2
so Witcher 2 made that point again this
was the first game that we encountered
where it looks like with uber sampling
on so we were running on the ultra
preset including uber sampling none of
the cards were actually even able to run
the game in surround except for GTX
Titan now on the AMD cards that's partly
due to the fact that CD Projekt RED does
not allow AMD configurations to run in
eyefinity and their surround setup and
that's for whatever reason that they
decided to unimplemented some point and
then they turned it off for whatever
reason but neither of the other Nvidia
solutions were even able to launch the
game so this is one where we are
actually benefiting from not only the
horsepower of Titan but also the huge
frame buffer and this brings into
the picture how Titan is intended to be
used so it's low it's low noise it's
relatively small for a high-performance
GPU I mean its 10.5 inches but I guess
pretty big but it's not the biggest GPU
ever made that's for sure and it is
quiet so you can either put it in a
small high-performance system or you can
take a bunch of them and stack them
together which are two scales extremely
well even up to 3-way SLI we've shown
this in the past with gtx 660ti s so
what that means is you could take a few
of these guys
you could probably eke out around 45 to
50 FPS with which or to at 57 60 by 1080
ultra preset and have enough video
memory to do it so it's a very unique
solution that way a very futuristic
solution that way although maybe not
necessarily the most cost-effective one
