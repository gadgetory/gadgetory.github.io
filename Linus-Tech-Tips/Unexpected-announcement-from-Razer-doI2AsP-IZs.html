West 2016 this year check out their
Blade stealth in the video description
down below we're checking out at the
razer booth now is the antic cube
designed by Razer so this is not the
first design by Razer that razor has
done but this is the first ITX version
that they've done then they pulled no
stops in terms of additional
compatibility this is not the smallest
ITX case at all that's not what they
were going for though they have water
cooling compatibility this one right
here has a 2 by 120 millimeter radiator
in the front of the case reservoir just
behind that and then water cooling on
the CPU and it also has compatibility
for a triple slot graphics card so this
graphics card in particular is not the
newest one on the market but it is a
Titan Zed so it's a triple slot card and
it's ridiculously fast below that there
is also a 120 millimeter radiator on the
back fan slot that is only compatible
with 120-millimeter fans in the front
you can have two 120 millimeter fans one
140 millimeter fan or one 180 millimeter
fan the bottom of the case supports
generally any length ATX power supply
you could want and in the back for
storage trace you have two two and a
half inch SSD trays that have captive
thumb screws on them one spot for a
three and a half inch drive or if you
take that out you have two more spots
for two and a half inch drives the case
has three dark acrylic panels one on
each side and then one on the top as
well and the rest of it is made up of
this dark aluminum that you're probably
familiar with from their blade line of
laptops the front of the case has the
same grille like look that you may have
seen from the core as well and then
there's tons of Razer lighting and logos
all over the place so it says Razer on
the side of the power supply basement it
has under glow in green which is just
completely Razer the power button is lit
up with a green ring around it the USB
ports are green the front of the case
has a light up green triple snake logo
so if you really like Razer it's AIT's
everywhere the previously mentioned side
panels are also tooless so there's a
spot on the back of the case which is
actually probably facing you right now
where you can hook your hand behind and
pull one side of it off and then the
second side comes off relatively easily
I was originally trying to take both
sides off at once just just start
with the one it's it's better so if you
want a small ITX system but not too
small and you want to be able to do
stuff like water cool and have a whole
bunch of different drives and all that
kind of stuff
maybe the cube is for you let me know in
the comments down below and they get a
razor for sending us here two packs OS
