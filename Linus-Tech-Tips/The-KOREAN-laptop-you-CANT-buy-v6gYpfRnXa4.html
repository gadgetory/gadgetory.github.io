immediately wanted it and then found out
that for some reason you can't have it
well that was the experience that I had
with this the lg ultra PC on the surface
it looks kind of like an LG gram which I
love but with a little bit more weight
and a lot more performance only one
small problem it turns out that you
can't get this thing outside of Korea
the South Korea to be precise I mean
look at this look at this amazing
promotional video that's gonna make it
an engaging or a PC
GT only six seconds long for some reason
anyway fortunately if you are annoying
enough and persistent enough I've often
found that you can get what you want
eventually
and it works for more than just wedding
proposals this is the LG Ultra PC a
laptop that has never before been seen
outside of its homeland and the video
about it is brought to you by Mac Weldon
Mac Weldon makes high quality clothing
be it t-shirts underwear see that right
there Mac Weldon underwear my cat
scratched me Mac Weldon can do nothing
to protect you from cat scratches if
it's not you know actually where the
underwear is anyway my talking points
are not actually on there so they make
underwear t-shirts socks wallets and
more and you can check them out using
offer code tectus to save twenty percent
at the link in the video description
I mean realistically if there were
instructions for how to open the box
they weren't gonna be in English so it's
open this baby up instructions unclear
got bags stuck on head of a baby okay so
if you're into that sort of thing LG
includes a nice little man satchel it's
probably cooler in Korea than it is here
yep all right so aside from the actually
pretty good feeling and presumably
stylish carry bag and the power adapter
pretty much the only thing in the box is
the ultra PC itself and it looks pretty
much exactly like I expected it's a big
fat gram overall it's not that heavy for
a 15-inch model just about two
centimeters thick at its thickest point
so again not unreasonably thick and in
terms of build quality like it's kind of
honestly it's kind of hard to describe
it cuz it's like it does feel in some
places pretty nice but then that's
definitely more keyboard flex than we'd
like to see and this is something that
has been an ongoing critique of ours
about LG is notebooks aisle wise it's
reasonable but not exceptional so you
got your HDMI headphone microSD USB a
couple USB threes a type-c USB 3 not
thunderbolt gigabit ethernet fire this
thing up shall we
is that their slogan in Korea hi there
I'm Cortana and I'm here to help a
little sign in here a touch a Wi-Fi
there and we'll have your PC ready for
all you plan to do and if you'd like me
to stay quiet you can just mute your PC
if you need an assistive screen reader
press the why is this in English why
does it take so long like what is the
point of pre loading all of this stuff
so it asks me what region but it asks me
in English it's weird this looks like a
bog-standard US layout keyboard just
with alternate Korean characters on it
no I don't want to make her ton of my
personal assistant under the hood
there's a couple of things about the
specs that stood out to us it's got an
85 50 u so that's a quad-core low-power
processor eight gigs of ram though it
depends what SKU you get as always 240
gig SSD 500 gig hard drive and the big
one was that it comes with a geforce gtx
1050 so what we were hoping for was with
that low-power processor but a discreet
graphics card in a larger clamshell was
a nice balance of battery life
performance and even the ability to game
a little bit hopefully at a decent price
let's start let's do that okay so first
step is to jump on nine eight and get
all our stuff set up and we will be
right back even LG's own software on
here it's like in English my new I
didn't install English Windows Cortana I
are I already I told you no I just told
you no so these are just ctrl and alt so
instead of just labeling both of them
twice they just hedged their bets they
figured well they'll infer from this
control adult that that's also ctrl +
alt and vice versa the only Korean only
software on here is their support number
so we've got all our software loaded up
now and one of the first things that we
do anytime a notebook hits our lab
is slap it with a stress test so stress
up to you that and almost immediately we
noticed something really interesting
about this particular model it detects
that it is thermal throttling and in
fact it's clock speed does get reduced
but the CPU is only sitting at about
sixty high to seventy low degrees on
each of the individual course so it
would appear as though the t-junction
temperature was miss configured by the
manufacturer now their intent may have
been to allow the CPU to burst up during
light loads but still not pass a bunch
of heat through to the user when it's
under a long strenuous load but this
does seem like a fairly extreme approach
if that was their intent you know
overall it really is a testament to how
far entry-level / mainstream graphics
cards have come that you can play doing
on a machine like this with a GTX 1050
and have not a bad experience like I'm
running it at high and I'm seeing dips
down to the low 30s but like it's very
playable especially considering the
fairly a/c speakers on the ground the
speakers are not bad and I still
maintain that at laptop screen sizes
1080p resolution is adequately
sufficient though it would be nice if it
was a touchscreen now for that let's
take it apart so poking around in here
there are a couple of takeaways number
one is that I'm a little confused as to
why LG felt the need to have the CPU
thermal throttle which supports our
hypothesis that that was sort of an
accident because the two heat pipes
connected to the CPU actually go to both
of these heat exchangers here you can
see our GPU over here upgradeable RAM so
we've got two sodium slots one of which
is
empty on our 8gig model but that would
be a nice and easy upgrade and actually
overall upgrade ability of this device
is pretty good you've got an m2 slot
here that one is populated and then
you've also got room for a two and a
half inch hard drive which is also
populated but you could swap those out
for something else should you desire
moving on to the battery we've got a
respectable 60 watt hours that did give
us about four hours in our standard
battery test but I did feel a little
disappointed by this just because LG has
built such a brand identity for
themselves on the grand side of things
around having these massive capacity
batteries in these thin and light
devices and this one just didn't meet my
expectations there and there are a
handful of other complaints that I have
about it as well first of all the
keyboard is crap there are two major
problems with it one there's a nice
tactile bump but the actuation point is
pretty much at the bottom of the stroke
and to the chassis just isn't stiff
enough around my right hand like it's
noticeably more flexible compared to my
left causing me to regularly miss
keystrokes in like this whole half of
the keyboard here now to be clear it's
not the worst keyboard I've ever used
but I would put it below say a dell
inspiron the trackpad is good enough no
issues but it also didn't Wow me and
it's pretty small by today's standards
so it gets a fine out of amazing and
honestly that's not a bad summary of
this device as a whole
everything from the performance to the
bezels to the webcam is fine except for
one big problem the pricing so if you're
part of the 0.3% of our audience that is
in South Korea it's actually not a
terrible option but if like us you were
hoping that this would be something like
the Xiaomi notebook Pro which wasn't the
best laptop we'd ever seen but was
priced well enough to be
worth the hassle of getting it here from
China then you're in for a rude
awakening
due to South Korea's fairly harsh import
regulations and taxes Samsung and LG
don't need to be quite as competitive in
their home market so this laptop at
$1600 would be up against much more
premium competitors outside of South
Korea another example of this is the
Samsung Galaxy s8 a phone that may have
actually been made in South Korea but
that costs a hundred and thirty dollars
more to buy there
hooray for Allah God please but it's not
a huge loss because even if LG was to
bring the Ultra PC to the rest of the
world which they've said they have no
plans to do the value proposition
wouldn't be amazing with a couple more
generations of improvement particularly
to the stiffness of the chassis and to
the keyboard LG may be in a position
where with the right pricing they could
expand their notebook line
internationally though so let's see if
they do it speaking of seeing now is the
time to see the link in the video
