filling out their DirectX 11 lineup so
they now have a mainstream part that's
going to be around 140 999 Street this
is a one gig card featuring a cyclone
cooler so obviously with the cyclone
cooler you might imagine it's made by
that vanilla MSI so the GTS 450 is meant
to slot in under the GTX 460 as you
might imagine and really take the place
in the price bracket that the GTS 250
used to occupy so why don't we go around
to the back of the card let's find out
what is special about the cyclone
version of this card it has a nine
centimeter pwm fan for 40% more airflow
it has multiple heat pipes meaning two
for a better heat dissipation and it has
a dust preventer design for longer fan
lifespan okay as I mentioned before this
is a DirectX 11 card finally add a truly
mainstream price point from Nvidia and
it features all of their latest
technologies including cuda physx sli 3d
vision and the rest of these are not
really Nvidia technologies but they are
also supported by the part it is a PCI
Express 2.0 card it requires a 6 pin
power connector and a minimum 400 watt
power supply so why don't we go ahead
and open up the box I'm actually filming
this a while ago I can't upload it until
the embargo so by the time you see this
you will be able to buy this card let's
have a look at the accessories that are
included it comes with a mini HDMI to
HDMI normal sized adapter put that back
in there there we go it comes with a two
molex to one PCIe 6 pin connectors mind
you seriously guys if you're not using a
power supply with the PCI Express power
adapter on it or connector on it like
really just get one because they're not
expensive okay we've got a DVI to VGA
adapter just in case you're still using
an ancient monitor now speaking of
ancient monitor this video card is
perfect if you're using an ancient
monitor because really this price
bracket video cards is designed
or around the 1280 by 1024 to 1680 by
1050 resolution range if you're running
a 24 inch monitor do yourself a favor
buy a GTX 460 but if you're running a
lower res monitor you want DirectX 11
you want the latest feature set from
Nvidia then this is a perfect choice we
also have a user's guide a copy of MSI
Afterburner and we have a little guide
on how to use their live update online
feature now let's look at the card
itself I have a feeling the cooler
itself isn't going itself so yeah I'm
saying itself too much the cooler is not
going to surprise us too much because we
have seen the cyclone color before MSI's
cyclone cooler is one of those value
designs that performs really well so
everybody loves it
I can tell you from my experience
working at NCIX that a lot of people
have picked up the GTX 460 cyclone
because it really does make the GPU run
cooler it's quiet and it's cheap I mean
what else can you ask for msi includes
these little covers on all the
connectors so I'm just removing all of
those so that I can actually show you
the card in great detail now I believe
this card does use a reference PCB and
the reason I'm gonna go ahead and assume
that it's because you can see right on
the back there are actually blank spots
where there are no RAM chips installed
so it looks like what we probably have
on here is one two three four five six
seven eight RAM chips for a total of one
gig and I am correct you can see on the
other side we've got an additional yeah
an additional four and those two spots
are also blank on the other side so I
guess it could support up to 1.5 gigs of
ram so I wouldn't be too surprised to
see a card a GTS 450 with more RAM in
the future although I have to say
there's probably not much benefit to
loading up RAM on a card like this
because it is a mainstream card here on
the back we've got two DVI ports as well
as a mini HDMI we've got the typical MSI
branding built
to the pci backplate now it's not even
terribly important that they have all
this ventilation here because this is
primarily an interior exhaust design
means you're not exhausting a ton of
heat outside the case but the benefit is
that you do get to keep the GPU cooler
you get all of this incidental airflow
going down over your RAM as well as onto
your power circuitry here and you do
still get to exhaust a little bit of
heat outside the case of events but it's
not going to be a ton power delivery is
all right here at the back of the card
as I said before I suspect this is a
reference PCB so you're not gonna find
anything exceptional in terms of power
delivery although for a mainstream card
like this you don't really need anything
exceptional here at the back of the card
you find a 6 pin PCI Express power
connector and then you can see the fan
is controlled by a PWM you know I don't
think I've ever talked about this before
no no it's state thought we look at the
card there we go
PWM means that there is a fourth pin
it's pulse width modulation so what it
means is it's only actually sending
voltage to the fan every so often
instead of actually decreasing the
voltage to run slower and then
increasing it to run faster instead it
just runs 12-volt all the time but it
does it in bursts so the fan if you're
running 12-volt all the time it'll spin
fast and if it does 12 volt 50% of the
time and then 50% of the time nothing
it'll spin slow there you go you learn
something today if you didn't know how
PWM fans work at the back of the card we
don't find anything particularly
exceptional we've got our PCI Express
16x interface and
I'm a little confused look at this I
don't think I've ever seen this before
there's a great number of missing pins
on the PCI Express 16x interface and I
don't know why uh you know what if we
have any astute viewers out there please
let me know why it is missing the
contacts here because I have not seen
that in the past I'm sure there's a very
good reason for it
but Todd there you go there's something
I've never seen before we do have an SLI
connector up here at the top of the card
remember one SLI connector that means
two-way SLI only no support for 3-way
SLI 3-way SLI is only supported on the
GTX 465 and up not the 460 nothing below
there except the older generation stuff
you know 275 etc etc and remember 4 Way
SLI is supported only on the 480 so that
pretty much covers everything I wanted
to say about the GTS 450 cycle and I'm
also gonna try and get some performance
numbers going at some point today thank
