let's call it a trend among computer
enthusiasts to no longer use protection
and I've definitely changed my habits as
well and for every day that might seem
okay but you get outside your comfort
zone every now and then you know you go
someplace you've never been before or
someone you don't know
messes with someplace that you used to
be comfortable in and before you know it
you're lost and alone and everybody
wants your bits which is why BitDefender
reached out to sponsor this video about
their security software and the role
that security solutions play in 2018 in
fact they're so confident about their
role but they've got something planned
for the end of this video
spoiler alert it's a
okay so first things first
why BitDefender I'm pretty sure that I'm
on the record saying that I don't use
antivirus software on my personal
machine anymore
I mean it's not that I don't care about
my security I do use security software
here at work we've got a site-wide
license and I do use it on relatives and
friends machines it's just that for
myself I found that common sense and
reasonable precautions are good for most
things and then what I'll do is I'll
just roll out a sacrificial virtual
machine when I need to do something a
little sketchy like let's say I need an
ISO for an old version of Windows or
something although that is horribly
inconvenient for most people and Anthony
who actually worked on writing this
video has seen plenty of cocky folks
like me taken down a peg at his old pc
repair job where they recommended
BitDefender and on that subject the
channel you're watching right now was
actually hijacked when I clicked on
something I shouldn't have got a
keylogger and they took away the account
that happened in probably about six or
seven years ago so this is one of those
do as I say not as I do types of things
anyway hot off winning product of the
year and consistently being at the top
for security
BitDefender came to us with a challenge
break our protection clearly they don't
know who they're dealing with but before
we go about testing that let's break
down some of those reasonable
precautions that you and you and
everyone you know should be implementing
regardless to prevent your data from
getting lost via an infection or worse
first of all keep local backups and raid
is not a backup of all critical data
this lets you get backup
and running more quickly in the case of
a drive crash or if you get hit by
ransomware which yes is still going
strong
not to mention is getting more
sophisticated all the time and it
happens
BitDefender can actually protect
important folders wholesale and
behaviorally protects everything else
against even zero days that haven't been
patched yet and this is before the
malware has a chance to encrypt anything
so this that minimum saves you from
having to restore from your backups and
at worst having to pay a ransom to maybe
if they actually go through with their
word I mean remember these are not the
most up-and-up folks to maybe get your
college thesis or your vacation photos
back none of that though will save you
if the building is on fire so you should
also keep an off-site backup these days
cloud storage services dominate this
space but you can also accomplish this
by just keeping a backup Drive in a
separate building like a friend's or
your parents house now back to that
common sense theory of personal
cybersecurity that essentially boils
down to three important points one keep
everything up to date at minimum stay on
top of your security updates number two
keep your stock protection enabled this
acts as a better than nothing last line
of defense
once something is on your PC which
brings us to three don't download stupid
stuff but I mean stupids not really a
fair word for it because as easy or
common sense as some of these things
might be for you it's not necessarily
common sense to people who don't live
and breathe Tech everyday and
furthermore it's not that uncommon for
popular websites to become targets of
poisoning attempts by hackers and we've
actually had additionally some very
convincing phishing scams roll into our
inboxes that appeared to be internal
mail from other people who work here and
these are both things that BitDefender
offers proactive protection against I
mean I'm sure that you guys all know
someone
you know who they are who downloads
anything with a shiny button
so why don't we go ahead and watch the
rest of this video from that perspective
so Anthony has provided me with a handy
dandy list of skeezy sites that I can
visit and I've got a virtual machine
that is protected by bitdefender up here
my mandate is to go to all of these
sites follow any link that crosses my
path and click on basically every ad
also I'll be installing some apps just
clicking next through the installers
without checking to see what they're
putting on my system my sisters watching
basically I'm channeling you alright so
right now we're not an autopilot so it's
going to give me notifications for
pretty much everything that happens this
is total security so this is their
top-of-the-line anti bad stuff
protection it's been a long time since
I've gone to a sketchy site what the
heck is this Steve Mike fire force info
yeah that's right I wonder if that one's
down devs a - dream.com to be very clear
we're not recommending you go any of
these places
BitDefender blocked this page Oh
so is it actually blocking content from
the page - ha all right
Lara Dimas how are these not loading so
even though browser doesn't like this
one you know what why was I using Chrome
in the first place
Anthony none of these pages are working
oh it's a sketchy redirect maybe these
are some friends that I can talk to oh I
won because there's no real domain sent
Oh better pixelate that Anthony were you
browsing these sites at work I gotta
find some stuff to download here
that sounds pretty sketchy this one down
to skewer will calm visit the site all
these sites are so slow all right we
found some of them that are still up so
I think I would like some free video
game what is when comm yeah our zoom
driver update that sounds pretty good
meanwhile let's go to Cinna he calm this
looks perfectly legitimate it's just
running off YouTube activate your free
account 256 bit SSL encryption you are
safe I don't have like a fake credit
card to give them yeah sure here we go
50 euros a month yeah no drivers support
dot exe that seems good yeah okay an
active optimization it's okay well while
that's running let's find some other
stuff here's an ad for Adobe this looks
like it may actually be a real thing his
torch bad it's not okay what do I carry
the publisher is yes the ultimate best
sites to watch free movies Kenny so that
game just didn't seem to actually do
anything active optimization do I have
to actually buy something to get
infected by this oh my god we need
something a registry optimizer quick
easy and safe
let's get 24 items repaired what does
that even mean
nothing freemake Video Converter
yes install all the things Google Docs
for dummies these aren't even downloads
these are just like stupid clickbait
lists okay so this is just junk where oh
hey
something finally tried to screw us
freemake video downloader tried to make
a change to a file in a protected folder
and was blocked and the program crashed
so we found out why it seemed like it
was impossible to infect the computer we
went into the notifications for
BitDefender and it's blocking the sites
with malware on them and in the warnings
tab we've got the junk that we just
installed so I guess if something falls
into the phishing fraud or malware
category then it's insta blocked and if
it's potentially unwanted and not
malicious it just warns you about it ok
no maybe I'll just turn it off for a
little bit is there a way to turn it off
here we go alright alright
advanced threat defense off off off off
okay come on yes we are providing all
the administrative access you need for
it no threat move to quarantine how did
it do the head I'm gonna get jiggy with
some infected pages here I'm trying so
hard to install garbage detected threat
is being dissipated even if I try and
turn it off it's still working so
overall we found this exercise both
frustrating but then also reassuring
because initially I thought it was
basically impossible to infect a
computer these days no matter what kind
of websites we tried to go to or what we
tried to click on it had been quietly
keeping us from actually getting
infected with anything they've got a
couple of different modes so they've got
both a game mode and a movie mode which
you can check out in the dashboard and
they have been found consistently to
have among the best detection rates in
the industry
according to AV comparatives and
avy test so there you go guys most of us
like me and Anthony and you the one
who's watching this are not gonna do
this kind of thing on a daily basis
although you know probably more often
than we might like to admit we do end up
on somewhat sketchy websites but we all
know someone who does frequent free TV
sites or you know registry repair
application sites and does fall for
online scams and that's where
BitDefender really comes into its own
because you can install it for them and
then not have to deal with the fallout
you know three or six months down the
line and speaking of six months as luck
would have it exclusively for our
viewers BitDefender is giving away a six
month subscription for new users so give
it a try and if you're the family tech
support guru maybe don't install it on
your own PC necessarily install it on a
loved one's computer set it on autopilot
and then reduce the number of support
calls that you have to deal with so
thanks for watching guys if you just
like this video you can hit that button
but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
that is enforcement defender at the link
