but this one's pretty important there's
two incredibly awesome announcements -
not four not zero but two number one is
the finished state of the tech quickie
channel so this is a second well second
third fourth I don't know however many
channels I have now so this is an
additional channel for me that is going
to be focused on a couple of different
types of content so number one is and
this will be completely different videos
from Linus tech tips they're still going
to be tech related but a totally
different style so you guys are gonna
want to make sure that you're subscribed
to it separately I'm gonna have a little
annotation in the bottom of the video
make sure you subscribe to tech quickie
while you're at it you can subscribe to
my cat tips channel as well if you feel
like it it is a real thing
see it's got like 30,000 subscribers I
do try to do videos every day or two so
tech quickie two things product showcase
videos so this is gonna be like the the
one we did on the Voyager air for
Corsair yep let's - here I know I know
I'm that guy I know who it is so this is
the one where we sort of showcase the
Voyager air in a bunch of different ways
they actually showed this at their CES
launch so that was really cool and then
the other type of content that we have
lined up well that we're producing right
now is going to be called two minutes or
less so this is the idea of taking a
basic concept or a quick thing like
installing a processor and doing a video
that's fast and punchy and tells you
everything you need to know about that
concept in only a couple minutes now
there's another thing that I want to
announce as well and that is our January
charity drive so if you go to the Linus
tech tips forum which I'm going to link
in the description of the video you can
see we're gonna be trying to do this on
a monthly basis we're guys we need your
help to make the channel grow and be
more popular and all of that stuff and I
don't really like doing the whole please
like my video please like my video in
every video because I think it's sort of
lame so what I'm gonna be doing is I'm
going to be setting sort of targets and
growth goals for sort of some kind of a
metric whether it's likes or comments or
whatever else I'm gonna say look here's
what we're gonna do this month if we hit
this target then we're going to donate
to the charity of your choice so the
thread for this month has a bunch of
different options so we're gonna do one
hundred and fifty bucks guaranteed
because it's already grown so much since
we announced starting
tenshun to implement this program and
we're gonna donate 250 bucks as a
stretch target now likes do not actually
contribute anything to my bottom line I
want to make that very clear it's more
of a long-term thing more like sequels
better search rankings better
preferential treatment in mostly search
rankings and related videos and things
like that so in the long run this should
work out really well but it's coming out
of my pocket right now so yeah but I
want you guys to help me decide will not
help me you guys are going to decide
where the money actually goes to so
these are the options for this month
we're gonna mix it up you can actually
see what people are voting for so far so
it looks like BC Children's Hospital's
the big winner I'm gonna disqualify
winners sort of month to month so that
we don't end up always giving it to the
same place because I want to swear to
spread things around a little bit I
figure if we're gonna do a vlog I can
also show you guys what our sets looks
like for tech quickie so this is
actually the remains of one that we were
filming today and we're gonna release
soon about picking the right fan for
your case and how to install a fan in
your case so it's gonna be mostly really
simple stuff but great linkable stuff so
if it's someone if someone asks you
something super basic like ooh what's
usb3
instead of explaining it to them you can
just link them to a tech quickie video
so make sure you're subscribed even if
you don't watch every video you should
just sort of have a look see what we're
producing and it might come in handy for
you at some point I think that pretty
much wraps up everything that I wanted
to say so oh yeah right I didn't really
sort of show you guys around properly so
this is that the reason I was building
that white box these are actual walls so
it was like a lot of work and stuff but
I think it's worthwhile because it sort
of works really really well as you guys
will see in the videos these are this is
part of the reason we got all this more
expensive equipment so some of these
other projects that we're working on not
because I want to be like you know the
YouTube blogger with the most expensive
possible camera but you need proper
equipment in order to get the production
values that we're trying to go for with
these other videos so here's our FS
here's our stupid expensive lights and
okay I think that's pretty much it as
always don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips and don't forget to
subscribe to tech quickie and don't
forget to definitely contribute to our

talk what is it cats if ya subscribe to
