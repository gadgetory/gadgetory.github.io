but this one's pretty important there's
two incredibly awesome announcements two
not four not zero but two number one is
the finished state of the tech quickie
channel so this is a second well second
third fourth I don't know how ever many
channels I have now so this is an
additional channel for me that is going
to be focused on a couple of different
types of content so number one is and
this will be completely different videos
from Linus tech tips they're still going
to be tech related but a totally
different style so you guys are going to
want to make sure that you're subscribed
to it separately I'm going to have a
little annotation in the bottom of the
video make sure you subscribe to tech
quickie while you're at it you can
subscribe to my cat tips channel as well
if you feel like it it is a real thing
see it's got like thirty thousand
subscribers I do try to do videos every
day or two so tech quickie two things
product showcase videos so this is going
to be like the the one we did on the
Voyager air for Corsair yep let's line
is here I know I know I'm that guy I
know who it is so this is the one where
we sort of showcase the Voyager air in a
bunch of different ways they actually
showed this at their CES launch so that
was really cool and then the other type
of content that we have lined up well
that we're producing right now is going
to be called two minutes or less so this
is the idea of taking a basic concept or
a quick thing like installing a
processor and doing a video that's fast
and punchy and tells you everything you
need to know about that concept in only
a couple minutes now there's another
thing that I want to announce as well
and that is our January charity drive so
if you go to the linus tech tips forum
which i'm going to link in the
description of the video you can see
we're going to be trying to do this on a
monthly basis where guys we need your
help to make the channel grow and be
more popular and all of that stuff and i
don't really like doing the whole please
like my video please like my video in
every video because i think it's sort of
lame so what I'm going to be doing is
I'm going to be setting sort of targets
and growth goals for sort of some kind
of a metric whether it's likes or
comments or whatever else i'm going to
say look here's what we're going to do
this month if we hit this target then
we're going to donate to the charity of
your choice so the thread for this month
has a bunch of different options so
we're going to do 150 bucks guaranteed
because it's already grown so much since
we announced starting
tention to implement this program and
we're going to donate 250 bucks as a
stretch target now likes do not actually
contribute anything to my bottom line I
want to make that very clear it's more
of a long-term thing more like sequels
better search rankings better
preferential treatment in mostly search
rankings and related videos and things
like that so in the long run this should
work out really well but it's coming out
of my pocket right now so yay but I want
you guys to help me decide will not help
me you guys are going to decide where
the money actually goes to so these are
the options for this month we're going
to mix it up you can actually see what
people are voting for so far so it looks
like bc children's hospitals the big
winner i'm going to disqualify winners
sort of month to month so that we don't
end up always giving it to the same
place because i want to swear to spread
things around a little bit i figure if
we're going to do a vlog i can also show
you guys what our sets looks like for
tech quickie so this is actually the
remains of one that we were filming
today and we're going to release soon
about picking the right fan for your
case and how to install a fan in your
case so it's going to be mostly really
simple stuff but great linkable stuff so
if it's someone if someone asks you
something super basic like ooh what's
USB 3 instead of explaining it to them
you can just link them to a tech quickie
video so make sure you're subscribed
even if you don't watch every video you
should just sort of have a look see what
we're producing and it might come in
handy for you at some point I think that
pretty much wraps up everything that I
wanted to say so oh yeah right i didn't
really sort of show you guys around
properly so this is that the reason i
was building that white box these are
actual walls so it was like a lot of
work and stuff but i think it's
worthwhile because it sort of works
really really well as you guys will see
in the videos these are this is part of
the reason we got all this more
expensive equipment so some of these
other projects that we're working on not
because I want to be like you know the
YouTube blogger with the most expensive
possible camera but you need proper
equipment in order to get the production
values that we're trying to go for with
these other videos so here's our FS
here's our stupid expensive lights and
okay I think that's pretty much it as
