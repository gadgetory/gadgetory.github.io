the accessories for the e Pad
Transformer TF 300 so we have a couple
of different things here one is there
versus leaf which is apparently wrap up
in elegant functionality your TF 300
dual positioning multi angle cover for
the e pad okay that is it that's the
whole description so hopefully once we
actually put and you've had inside it
it'll become somewhat more
self-explanatory that's kind of nice
actually so the outside actually has a
similar finish to the original
transformer sort of looking thing okay
and the inside uses like a microfiber II
feeling very very soft fabric like this
going on whatever that is I guess you
can store like a micro SD card in there
or something that's kind of cool okay
we've got this is kind of a like I'm
delivery type thing okay so you throw
your tablet in there so we're gonna try
putting an actual tablet in but first
we're gonna have a look at the
transformer pad mobile dock so since the
first transformer Asus has been doing
this whole keyboard dock II extension IO
battery expansion Eve thingy that makes
the transformer tablets really set apart
from their competition so in terms of
stuff that's included you got a user's
manual which is probably unnecessary for
this particular thing because it's
really easy basically what you do is you
plug your TF 300 into it just line it up
using the little arrows no can you see
the error when you work sorry I do 39 up
using little arrows plug it in it clicks
into place turns your tablet into a
netbook so basically the netbook is dead
unless you really need like a much lower
cost solution because this isn't really
that cheap stone but you get all of this
functionality so you get a keyboard or
you get a touchpad you get a full
keyboard including all this all these
hotkeys and all this
it's sort of here hold on let's go back
to home there we go so it's that one yet
not sure okay so you get all of these
hotkeys related to Android functionality
full keyboard numbers arrows everything
that you need so it turns the it turns
the tablet from sort of a cool video
watching web browsing device into a
legitimate note-taking productivity
device that is still super portable and
still touchscreens so just because you
plug this in doesn't mean you can't
still use the touchscreen as well now
what else does it have it also has what
the heck is this oh right that's for
charging it haha so that's a soos is a
proprietary dot connector on the front
not a whole lot on this side we've got
an SD card slot as well as a USB port so
you also add IO functionality to the
tablet no the tablet already has a
microSD slot so you can add add add an
additional SD card for a like whopping
on it on even on a 16-game up so let's
say on a 32 gig model and you throw a
couple 32 gig SD cards which were like
25 bucks each these days for 50 bucks
plus the cost of the tablet you've got
whatever 32 gigs times three is 96 gigs
of storage on this device I mean that's
getting up there with laptops with SSDs
that's awesome on the bottom you got
your rubberized grip ease not to mention
right the last but not least part the
transformer keyboard is not just a
keyboard an i/o it's also a battery
expansion pack so when you're running
low on battery you pop it into the
bottom piece assuming the bottom piece
is charged and you can actually run for
up to 15 hours on the two of them
combined if they both have a full charge
so that is pretty cool as well I think
that pretty much covers it now let's
have a look our folks are left we
already took a look but it was a very
brief look at the vs. leaves so I don't
know if it fits it with the keyboard
dock but apparently it does okay so
there you go that's what it looks like
with the keyboard dock on it however I
don't think that is necessarily the
intended use what it looks like to me is
here's how you've undock it it's really
easy okay to me it looks more like think
they've got some like usage scenarios
here so let's figure out how this works
so you start in here okay so that's
pretty straightforward looks like that
okay and then you can also prop it up
apparently so let's figure out how that
works shall we that doesn't seem right
wait really I think this is how they
have it set up like it's folded once and
then it's like holding like that no way
see that's how the diamond that's not
the diagram it's like that oh no no the
diagram is a little triangle like that
there we go okay yes success that is how
to do it in sort of 1 minute or less how
to how to prop up a tablet on a thing oh
you can do it the other way too okay so
you can also set it up oh wait no that's
the same way as well
okay so no there's video config and
typing config so you take it out you
prop this thing into here and then you
put this there AHA now we're in typing
config so now you can you have a bit of
a lure wrist rest thing while you type
and then the other solution is putting
this into here and now it's propped up
more for viewing videos yes thank you
for checking out my unboxing my very
awkward presentation of how to use it
and first look at the mercy sleeve as
well as the mobile block for the TF 300
