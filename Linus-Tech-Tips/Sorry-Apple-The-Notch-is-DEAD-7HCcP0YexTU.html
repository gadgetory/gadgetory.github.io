doesn't have a notch in it Shami me mix
three all screen nice no not sweet
snapdragon 855 processor oh nope looks
like they're reserving that for the 5g
model but it's got a slide it's so
satisfying what an innovative idea
having the phone slide like that why
didn't anybody ever make a slider phone
before feels good

the meme x3 is xiaomi's newest flagship
and it is readily apparent as soon as
you open the box we even get this note
from Xiaomi CEO Li Jun on the road of
exploration we will constantly invest
constantly strive and constantly break
through we are willing to devote an
additional 100 percent even if we only
improve by 1% be friends with our users
be the coolest company in the hearts of
our users yeah sure it flows a lot
better in Chinese next we've got the
phone itself and then finally in the
last compartment of the box you get a
shockingly complete accessory package
the headphone dongle kind of sucks it's
a little thin and the case is
unexceptional at best but they included
a 10 watt wireless charger it's like a
$50 value now on to the phone this thing
is pretty
it's got smooth curves a rear that's
surprisingly easy to hold on to and a
thicker profile that tickles me and
exactly the RET sorry what was i talking
about right phone sorry so one thing
you'd expect in a device that is shoes
the modern thin is in design trend is a
bigger battery but the mix 3 actually
loses 200 million powers of rated
capacity over its predecessor on the
right edge we've got our volume buttons
and a lock button and then on the Left
we've got an AI button that can be set
up to launch pretty much anything you
want through a combination of single
press double press and long press
activations I'm gonna let that sink in
for a moment
Samsung are you guys listening that's
how simple it is to make proper use of
an extra button so the thickness
actually makes room for the slide but
we're gonna get into that later first
let's talk about the screen it's a 19
and a half by 9 aspect ratio 1080p
AMOLED panel that gives the mix 3 a
staggering 9
3.4% screened to body ratio that means
that it is unmatched by all but the Oppo
find X which also used a sliding
mechanism for itself you can the
difference here is that unlike the
motorized find X the mix 3 is all manual
but in actually a good way it feels a
lot like those old slide phones with the
built-in keyboards and it's both
satisfying in the hand and solid with no
wobble or anything like that to feel
concerned about it now I was worried
about the motorized design on the find X
so honestly I'm actually happy to see
this more pragmatic approach show up
even if it doesn't quite have the sex
appeal so the way it works is it gives
you this visual cue when you slide it by
pulsing along the screen edges and it'll
emit a configurable audio tone just in
case you need your phone to sound like
you've unsheathed disord when you're
taking a selfie for some reason what's
cool is that it isn't all for show so
you can actually turn the slide into a
gesture that performs an action of your
choosing Samsung are you guys taking
notes on this though this approach does
have its flaws so if you like using your
phone for more than one thing like say
for example taking selfies and also
engaging in video calls chances are that
you'll find Auto launching an app as
annoying as it is helpful and it would
be nice to have a black list of apps
where when they're open it doesn't just
take over what you're doing now on the
plus side if you choose to take a selfie
option which is what I've got going on
here it will even work without unlocking
your phone pretty nice speaking of which
the mix 3 does have face unlock but
unlike the find X and the iPhone 10 for
that matter the whole experience does
feel a little less magical and seamless
because you have to manually slide the
phone in order to expose the sensors the
good news is that unlike the iPhone 10
Xiaomi didn't feel the need to remove
the rear fingerprint sensor so if you
prefer that way
well then you've got good old-fashioned
fingerprint sensing that is virtually
instantaneous and pretty darn accurate
so much so that it's actually possible
to accidentally unlock the phone just by
brushing against it in your pocket and
that level of responsiveness is
system-wide even though the writing is
on the wall for the snapdragon 845 SOC
that our mix 3 is equipped with now on
our 6 gig model everything that's butter
smooth and even opening apps from a cold
start is quick and painless and it can
only get better from there if you spring
for the top-end model you get a whopping
10 gigabytes of RAM to make sure that
there's always some memory available for
task switching though that's most of the
nice stuff that I can say about the
software experience it's no secret that
me UI is not my favorite Android skin
but its latest iteration did at least
get a couple of things right the system
theme is consistent feeling it looks
reasonably pleasing and jemmye
apparently didn't get the memo that and
rape I dropped the quick access to
system-wide audio sliders which is just
fine by me and actually while we're at
it the camera app is pretty competent
too there's plenty of manual shooting
options here to control things like
exposure ISO and white balance along
with a number of shooting modes you got
your night mode your 9 60 FPS slo-mo and
a bunch of what Xiaomi calls AI modes AI
portrait AI beautify AI studio lighting
AI scene detection and AI background
music that's a weird one the cameras
themselves are arranged in a two
front-to-rear configuration with the
primary front camera using the new sony
IMX 576 sensor that's set up to make use
of super pixels essentially simulating a
larger physical sensor with its massive
resolution to reduce the incidence of
noise and improve low-light performance
as for our testing well it I don't know
sort of worked it's a little weird
so our low-light photos weren't
especially noisy but there was
definitely a lot of smoothing going on
more than you might expect even on an
Asian phone that's got all the beauty
enhancement that you would expect from
it as for the rear shooter well it's
kind of the usual Xiaomi experience if
you're a full manual operator then
there's plenty of options but if you
just want to pick up and snap and get
something usable every time you're still
gonna want a pixel or an iPhone or if
you're on a budget I guess a 1 plus
interestingly it does seem to handle
highlights very well as seen in our
living room shot here but it's
processing tends to over brighten the
image beyond what looks natural I mean
these days when it comes down to is that
software processing is far more
important than the specs of the camera
and that's an area where Google and
Apple still stand out though I am
rooting for the s10 to be a big leap
forward for Samsung's processing also
I've got some more bad news along with
the lack of headphone jack is another
missing feature that I've come to expect
on high-end smartphones stereo speakers
why have all of this screamed for
watching YouTube TV shows and movies on
the go if you're just gonna put a single
downward firing speaker without an
amplified earpiece speaker and it's not
even a fantastic one now with that said
you are getting a bit of a discount at
between five hundred and sixty to 600
bucks on gearbest the mix threes main
competitor is the oneplus 16 and it
doesn't give up much in comparison at
least on paper specs are very similar
now the front fingerprint scanner on the
60 is a BFD and 1 plus as oxygen OS is
in my humble opinion miles ahead of me
UI but that's almost a completely
separate video and anyway to counter
that Xiaomi not only supports wireless
charging which one Plus does not they
even throw in the aforementioned charger
so I think for a lot of people it's
gonna come down to style which is I
guess how Samsung and Apple keep
managing to charge a lot more for phones
that frankly don't have much on their
Chinese competitors at this point
