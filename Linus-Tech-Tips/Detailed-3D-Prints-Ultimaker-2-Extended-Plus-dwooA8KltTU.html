go the Ultimaker 2 extended plus there's
some pretty cool new features here
mainly the new orientation of the fans
the exchangeable printheads and the new
feeder thanks to Squarespace for sending
us here to CES 2016 this year their link
is in the description down below
starting with the printhead ultimate or
worked with the guys in the community
that made the Olson blog so it's an
exchangeable printhead that goes from
0.25 to 0.4 0.6 and then up to 0.8 if
you use much smaller filament material
you can make something that's much finer
more detailed print but it will take you
a lot longer and vice versa so there the
large stuff it'll take you less amount
of time but it won't look quite as good
on the topic of print quality we have
the orientation of the fans this doesn't
seem like a huge deal but changing how
the fans were oriented allowed them to
push a lot more air flow through which
actually makes a huge deal and this
allows you to make higher quality prints
not just it's not that just things cool
down a little bit faster it's how you're
able to do more detailed operations with
the printer which is super important and
the next main point is the new feeder
it's much larger and overall format size
than the previous feeder which actually
makes a ton of sense a problem with the
previous feeder was that the motor would
make the gears too hot which would make
the plastic too hot which was a problem
now not only are the gears made out of
nylon so they don't transfer heat that
much but they're also a little bit
further away from the motor so that heat
transfer shouldn't be as big of a deal
also very cool side note there's now a
switch on the side of the feeder which
allows you to disengage the gear
allowing you to manually pull out the
print filament which is great another
random tidbit side note thing is that
the little white bit of plastic I don't
really remember the name of its job that
it does but it sits in between the hot
and cold zones on the actual printer it
has had a durability increase which is
great because when you're sitting in
between a hot and cold zone breaking is
gonna definitely be a huge problem now
are you sad because you have an
altimeter to our ultimate go to extended
and you want the plus features but you
don't want to buy anyone because they're
super expensive that's okay no launch
date yet but they will be releasing ulta
maker plus
maker two plus kits so you can upgrade
your current kit to that it's not going
to be the easiest thing to do but you
might be able to take it to a center or
something like that if you're worried
about your abilities anyways guys thanks
