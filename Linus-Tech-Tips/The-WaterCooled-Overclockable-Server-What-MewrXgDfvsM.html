that is area so statically safe what is
an insulator unless it's wet in which
case it's not okay it's only like $1,000
CPU like realistically you're gonna drop
it anyway so like so inside this box is
one of the most bizarre products to ever
land in our inbox I think both Jake and
I had exactly the same reaction gigabyte
sends out this press release they're
like you guys we have water-cooled
overclockable servers and we were both
like we need that well no I think the
first thing I said was but why I
definitely just wanted it and if you do
have that can we use it to replace our
networked video transcode server so
we're gonna answer all of those
questions and more after this message
from our sponsor pulse wave who you can
use to monitor your servers with pulse
weight you can remotely monitor manage
and control your Windows Mac and Linux
machines all from one app create your
free account today at the link in the
video description
okay uh who's taking it
I was just gonna hear it's all you
classic you take it I got it yeah yeah
go for it
I believe in you okay that's not too bad
so the first thing we notice about this
after that it includes some handy tool
estrellas that's nice is that this is a
1u server so this is as slim as you
would expect something like a like a a
router or a network switch to be except
that this thing can handle do I
understand this correctly up to a 70 900
X oh no claims 77 gigahertz 79 80 XC or
a 79 80 XC at they claim 4.6 gigahertz
that is a lot of performance to squeeze
into a form factor like this one so
going over the outside of the server the
first thing we notice is a really thin
honeycomb mesh over here that's for
pretty obvious reasons this thing's
gonna need some serious air flow we've
got those aren't supposed to be swimming
are these I did that you did that so
this is just to look cool are they all
okay there are some of the men measured
we're all say - yeah I'll say - all
right so weird it's like they let
someone like me onto their product team
it says two times u dot - 2 times SATA
hot swappable SSD based there you go
maybe they were color coded back playing
up here it's not all plugged in and
there isn't enough cables to plug them
in so all right well we'll have a lot of
a look at it here first we can check out
the back so we've got one management
port two gigabit network ports that was
a little disappointing 10 gig would have
been nice
serial as well as VGA and then these
these are interesting check this out
so if I were a betting man and someone
said this is a 1500 watt power supply
how many watts do you think this one is
I would probably say something along the
lines of well if this is a per volume
calculation
I don't know 250 or 300 no no no this is
an 1100 watt 80 plus Platinum power
supply that is cooled by this van
and there's two they are redundant so in
the event that one of them fails the
system will continue to run and
basically I expect these to be
incredibly loud wow what the hell
there's 20 fans there's 20 I think these
are like the 23 thousand rpm ones and
these might be the trickiest radiators
I've ever seen these are one new
radiators and they're different sizes -
yeah because this is highly custom so
let's have a look then at how this
closed-loop cooler goes so check this
out we can easily see what the flow path
is gonna be so cool water marked blue
comes in to our CPU where the pump is
also located and then the hot water
comes out goes to this radiator comes
out of this one and then back around
here and then cold goes back into the
CPU so we're actually using both of
these rads to cool just the CPU in terms
of the rest of the specs we've got eight
memory slots so that's quad channel
we've got a single PCI Express slot
which there is no obvious way to
actually plug anything in so what we
actually end up with is oh that's an
interesting one an other more different
PCI Express slot that is broken out to -
16 X slots up here installed sideways
but then also into this one x slot so
wait wait where's the electrical
signaling actually coming from is it
this one I think it's that one yeah it
must be this might be like power or just
for stability like if you're gonna build
a custom board just for this server
right put the USB header somewhere you
can yeah what about all this space here
if you try to put a GPU here it might
even block yeah see that's so weird
because so not only are we limited to
half-height PCI Express cards which is
really gonna affect our ability to
upgrade networking or add a GPU to this
thing this is going to severely limit
the length of the cards we can install
as well when it really seems to me as an
you know a relative lay person like this
could have just been put over here look
you imagine being the engineer that gets
given this assignment I'm sorry you want
to build what yeah so if you could make
a PCB that powers over 2020 3000 rpm
fans that would be great thanks excuse
me why the power draw so gnarly that it
has an 8-pin exactly PS this is an EPS
connector that that provides CPU power
in the desktop systems for mere mortals
those are good for 300 watts I think all
right so what are we going with for CPU
choice I think we're gonna go with a 70
900 X so our current system has a 69 50
X almost dropped it there and this is
also a 10 core so it should be kind of
close in terms of performance although
we're gonna get the next generations
improvements and then we're also going
to get our overclock improvements
because this is going to overclock
better than that ugly water-cooled hood
now the weirdest thing about this
configuration is this building a server
with like Corsair gaming memory normally
you would use ECC memory in a server
because that way if there's a friggin
solar flare and a bit flip or whatever
it can automatically be corrected and
the system can keep running without
interruption but there's a couple of
factors at play here one we're planning
to overclock the bloody thing anyway it
wasn't gonna be it wasn't gonna be have
the same kind of stability you'd expect
from a normal server and to because
we're running an overclockable core i9
processor it actually doesn't even have
support for ECC memory so with that said
we couldn't just choose any old gaming
Ram because it doesn't fit it's even on
like the exact same plane as this
bracket here so it just barely fits
that's nuts I mean the funny thing about
this too is that can't see I've wanted
overclockable servers for as long as
I've been a computer enthusiast but now
that someone actually made one I'm like
experienced enough to know that it's not
like that not have been the greatest
idea what is that so this is a 1050 T I
had to do a little modification we took
the shroud off but there's gonna be
plenty of airflow so it shouldn't be a
problem it's even got its own duct like
it's perfectly fine all right so we're
gonna have a slight issue here - so you
have to take this thing out together
here this connector is actually so close
that it hits it and I'm gonna have to
bend it down while you stick the card in
there it looks ghetto but it's really
not that ghetto what did I catch it I
think I'm in no you cut all oh but it's
in Oh God good enough screw all right
you win
 oh so we're gonna put a headless
HDMI thing in here too so when we're
remoting in you get the full resolution
you know honestly I don't even feel that
bad about our get honest here because if
you look at like how the server was
actually designed they literally just
took like a piece of foam here and cut a
hole in it I think that's like and put
it there to keep the airflow going
through the radiators that jank it's
like nice foam at least it's not like
it's styrofoam
it's probably like electrically apple
hitting do it this way
oh well man if Apple starts making
servers again they're gonna have dongles
on their servers you're just gonna see
like a thunderbolt hanging out of the
front of the server with like get your
fiber line and your whatever like okay
should we plug it in there so that's it
yeah let's let's plug this top back on
because I think the airflow is pretty Oh
put this on the right way hold on I can
do this Shh
I believe impressive taking your server
for a walk yeah all right let's go we
got to take care of them otherwise they
get out of shape stuff okay so we just
found a spare spot in our server room
just about we let it sit there yeah just
slide it in there I mean the rails are
really only designed for one server but
like whatever yeah it's not like that's
a really heavy one anyway that is really
really loud like honestly here hold on
can we close this door for a sec yeah
yeah clearly even with all the sound
deadening that we put in this room which
people mocked me for but actually works
for it works phenomenally thank you
what's that yeah yeah it penetrates like
I'm over by the green screen now that's
an actual problem like ya know I don't
know if that's gonna okay it just dialed
it back a little yeah okay right now
it's fine so
process of overclocking this thing was
actually kind of a nightmare but we're
there and our CPU is running at a cool
4.7 gigahertz now it wasn't actually
that easy to get it here gigabytes
manual for this server doesn't exist yet
yeah and there's some extra steps so in
addition to setting your core voltage
and setting your CPU multiplier like you
would overclock you on a desktop board
you have to key some magic value so
let's go ahead and hit it with a stress
test that 65 watts that I don't know 69
69 yes
no bad all right so let's start a stress
test make sure she holds 100%
utilization 4.7 gigahertz what kind of
temperatures are we looking at 62 1750
75 degrees heck yeah so we loaded some
stuff on here we've got regular
Cinebench which we're gonna run real
quick here and by real quick I do mean
literally real quick this should be very
fast and then to address that Cinebench
has actually gotten to the point where
very high-end processors run it too fast
to use it as a reliable benchmark we've
got the new unofficial it's called
Cinebench extreme extreme we're gonna
try that out as well so kicking things
off we got ourselves 2500 points which
is pretty good now let's try extreme
which is basically just four times the
resolution this one first
whoa look at those temps yeah they're
starting to get up there that is quite
the load Wow
we are above ninety degrees on a handful
of course here you might say that this
benchmark takes a hot minute okay I'll
give you that one oh we did detect some
overheating but our throttling
percentage is zero and it finished so
she seems to be 656 which I have no
context for because this is a brand new
benchmark I've never used before so why
don't we go ahead and shut all of that
down
let's do our our network network render
okay so I got just down there that is
one of Adobe's sample files sure so
we're just open up final one and we're
gonna export this like we would an LTT
video so the 60 megabit per second and
then 75 cool at 4k and it is fully
utilizing our CPU so one thing that we
observed about our network render server
way back when I had intended to use like
18 cores eons in it or something was
that there's a limit to how many threads
media encoder can actually use so it's
better to have fewer higher clock
threads than it is to have many many
threads in a lot of cases which is how
we ended up with an overclocked render
server in the first place so this looks
like it could be a viable replacement so
the results are in and Cinebench both
Cinebench and Cinebench extreme gave us
20% increases in performance that's
actually quite a bit more than I was
expecting right so the increase in clock
speed is 17 and a half it's still 20% so
we're getting in like what 3% increase
the IPC but then in Premiere we actually
got a 30% uplift going from what it
doesn't that thing having it a GTX 980
and a 16:9 50 and this 6:9 50x not
frickin bad but the problem is it's loud
the other problem is that this whole
this whole experience still hasn't
really enlightened us as to what that
crap this thing's actually for so Jake
intrepidly sent an email to gigabyte
asking them what is this for why does it
exist why did you build an overclockable
1u server can't even put a GPU like that
doesn't really have networking like what
would you even use this for and the
answer is the finance industry high
frequency trading so you would take this
server you need the highest possible
freakin performance you need something
that's air-cooled so it can just be
slotted into your existing server room
you throw one of these puppies in or
maybe even a newer one so this is a 100
gigabit InfiniBand card so super low
latency
yeah wire that up to your net
and the difference in these like what
are like milliseconds maybe five
milliseconds the difference there could
be hundreds of thousands or millions of
dollars in that industry
a couple hundred traders over a year
like it can be a big increase for a
small amount of money so the investment
in one of these servers makes a ton of
sense there but for us I'm not running
out and recommending that everyone go
and buy one of these it's just too
freaking loud it's it's very loud
otherwise it'd be pretty sweet though
yeah like maybe we should just
re-inflate whatever like the second
layer or we could even just put like
more sound deadening around that box or
we could just upgrade the server that's
in there right now but we won't be able
to do that without getting paid by our
