1080p resolution for the GeForce GTX
Titan this card is in a class of its own
it has over 2,500 cuda cores overclocked
and we run all of our graphics
benchmarks overclocked we were able to
run it consistently at well over 1.1
gigahertz around 1.13 to 1.4 gigahertz
with GPU boost
it features GPU boost 2.0 which
basically amounts to more
customizability in terms of the fan
profiles as well as the boost clocks of
the card and even over volting options
that we've never seen before and i think
you guys are going to be pretty
impressed with the performance this is
based on the same Kepler architecture as
the GK 114 or GTX 680 which was the
previous ruler of the roost in terms of
the Nvidia stack but this one comes in
at a much higher performance level and a
much higher price it has six gigs of RAM
which probably won't benefit it much at
1080p but you can check out my other
videos at 2560 by 1600 as well as 57 60
by 1080 in three ways surround in order
to get some idea of what you think about
the six gig frame buffer now the
contenders for this video this is meant
to be a heavyweight showdown there are
no no mid-range graphics solutions
included so we've gone with 660ti sli to
show sort of what - better value but
lower performance cards in sli might be
able to do we've gone with a 79 70 which
is the best single GPU card from the AMD
camp to go up against Nvidia's best
single GPU card however they're in very
different price ranges we've got a GTX
680 which is Nvidia as previous top
top-of-the-line single card and to
represent dual 79 70s since we did take
to lower end GPUs from Nvidia and run
them in sli we have an asus aries - so
this is 279 70 gigahertz Edition GPUs
this one's pretty expensive but the
results should be pretty close to what
you'd get with two normal cards as well
so let's start with our first game which
is Crysis the old joke can it run Crysis
the answer is yes yes indeed it can the
GeForce GTX Titan destroys Crysis it
beats the Aries - which is priced about
$500 higher for an actual Aries - or
pretty similarly if you buy a couple 79
70s it beats 660ti SLI and leaves the
7970 in the 680 the other only single
GPU solutions in the dust crisis 3
obviously just launched so this is
another one yeah haha can it break but
can it run Crysis 3 the answer is once
again yes it can the only solution that
beats out the GTX Titan in Crysis 3 is
the gtx 660ti sli solution so it beats
the 680 by a handy 25 to 30% beats the
aries 2 handily and the 7970 you can see
here the aries ii didn't scale very well
in Crysis 3 probably not optimized yet
for dual GPU on AMD it wasn't much
faster than a single 7970 moving right
along Far Cry 3 another popular title
that's actually pretty new as well it's
something you might notice about all
these graphs is we've labeled what
settings were running at so you can
reproduce the results if you want and
we've gone with higher settings than we
normally do because this is a
heavyweight battle so the Titan comes
out on top again in Far Cry 3 beating
out the Aries to the 7970 660ti sli
really didn't fare very well in Far Cry
3 barely scaling at all and just edging
out the GTX 680 which comes in at the
bottom of the heap for this particular
game Skyrim now Skyrim we're doing
things quite a bit differently in the
past we've run a bone-stock Skyrim with
just the high res texture pack that's
gone completely out the window we are
running 18 mods from the Steam Workshop
and Slick's going to be creating a
skyrim benchmarking guide hopefully
sometime in the next couple weeks so you
guys can check out how we run Skyrim
exactly because it gives it it makes it
much more demanding and gives it more of
a more of a PC like well it makes it so
there's a point having a high end
graphics card to run it gives you more
of a PC gaming experience rather than
dumbed down console graphics a lots of
trees better textures on everything
looks absolutely fantastic so the Titan
comes out on top in Skyrim and the Ares
2 is only beat by the Titan then the
single GPU solutions fall a little bit
down and
gtx 660ti sli really didn't scale that
much from 680 well the thing that I do
notice here is that we still don't see
maybe as much performance difference in
Skyrim as we could if we added even more
mods so by the time we do our
performance guide it's possible we'll
have changed to this battlefield 3 is
getting to be a bit of an older title
but it's still very graphically
demanding AMD crossfire X scales
incredibly well in this game so you can
see the Ares 2 actually performs about
double as well as a 79 70 is so rare to
see perfect crossfire scaling then the
Titan performs similarly to a 660ti sli
so this is where that discussion about
do you want a single GPU or do you want
a dual GPU solution really comes to
comes to a head because dual GPU
solutions like this where the Ares 2
just destroys everything else look
pretty compelling grab a couple of these
you're going to get the best possible
gaming experience in battlefield 3 hands
down however the Titan because it's a
single GPU is consistent across the
board it consistently performs better
than the 680 and the 7970 single GPUs
whereas sometimes those dual graphics
card solutions perform the same or just
a little bit better and sometimes they
leave the single GPUs in the dust
our last two games are Metro 2033 which
is also an older title but does continue
to scale well which did incredibly well
in crossfire again with the Ares two
leaving everything behind the Titan
still beats out the 660ti and destroys
the GTX 680 this seems to be more of an
AMD favoring title in spite of the the
way it's meant to be played branding on
the title but you see that happen from
time to time Witcher 2 is our last one
we're using the ultra preset including
uber sampling now one of the things that
made Ober sampling unappealing in the
past was the fact that it was extremely
demanding on the graphics card memory at
a time when most graphics cards were
shipping with one to one-and-a-half gigs
of VRAM not a big deal anymore 6 gigs of
RAM you can run witcher 2 at Ultra
presets at pretty much whatever
resolution you want that's what makes
the Titan ready for not only current
generation games but future generation
games and future resolutions even
surround was no big deal in terms of the
memory
saij on the gtx titan so that pretty
much wraps it up in terms of 1080p
performance the conclusion is pretty
simple if you're looking for the best
possible performance from a single GPU
card then go for it
however it's not cheap and unlike what
you're going to see in our other
performance review at 2560 by 1600 the
titan doesn't really stretch its legs
until you get to those higher
resolutions with that said we did run
the games at more demanding settings
than we usually do with lower end cards
in order to show you that even at 1080p
the titan does distance itself from
other single GPU solutions thank you for
