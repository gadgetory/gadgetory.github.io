from being kind of a frump compared to
its much hotter cousin the s6 it lacked
a fingerprint sensor at a time when that
was the next big thing to have for quick
secure authentication the next
generation of active integrated a
fingerprint reader with the clicky home
button for a truly no compromises
experience though except the regular s7
s killer new feature was ip68 water
resistance removing one of the actives
main selling points that n the s7 active
was really bulky even foreign active so
as you'd probably expect this generation
is full of compromises again here we go
after the expected message from our
sponsor Intel HP's new almanacs line-up
comes equipped with Intel seventh
generation Core i7 processors check them
out at the link in the video description
now in terms of the internal hardware
the s8 active is every bit as worthy of
the flagship label as the s8 and the
no-date it's got an octa-core processor
four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of storage with
microSD expansion I mean you guys know
the drill
but it's also got a couple of tricks up
its sleeve that they don't
first is the shatter resistant screen
encased in a mil standard 810g
temperature dust shock and pressure
resistant enclosure and second is the
massive 4000 milliamp hour battery
inside let's start with a closer look at
the screen this one is a bit of a mixed
bag from the regular s8 it carries over
the bright accurate once configured
correctly 5.8 inch 20 960 by 1440 AMOLED
panel the unusual 18 and 1/2 by 9 aspect
ratio and on-screen buttons including a
pressure-sensitive home instead of
hardware buttons a tough pill to swallow
for some longtime active fans though it
wasn't a huge deal for me
I personally like the flexibility of
being able to hide them for more room
for consuming vertical content not to
mention horizontal content the big
screen makes the s8 active supremely
awesome for watching movies or other
ultra wide aspect ratio content when
you're on the go as long as you don't
mind using headphones or the in my
opinion inexcusable in 2017 mono bottom
facing speaker configuration but if you
were hoping for a shatter resistant
display that also manages to somehow
wrap around the edges of the device
infinity style then you'll be sorely
disappointed by the flat glass and
definitely not bezel list
75% screen to body ratio though again
this isn't something that bothered me
that much the s8 active is actually as
big an improvement over the s7 active in
terms of its screen to body ratio as the
st. was to the s7 the bigger issue is
that while both phones use Gorilla Glass
five many users are reporting that the
shatter resistant coating seems to make
this one much more susceptible to micro
scratching and mine does definitely have
some micro scratches though with that
said my s8 has just as many from similar
use in my pocket so take that as you
will actually have a theory that whether
it's Corning's batch to batch variation
or the different configurations that OMS
requests for it they're glass products
are ending up with the same name for
marketing purposes but really different
characteristics the droid turbo gen one
that i used for a year and then that
terran has been using since has Gorilla
Glass 3 but it has almost no surface
imperfections to this day while the rest
of my phone's Apple and Android usually
end up scuffed to Hell by Pocket lint
within a few days anyway I digress let's
talk about the second big selling point
of this phone the battery even as a
pretty heavy user I managed only once to
kill the s8 active in a single day and
that was only because I subjected it to
over six hours of simultaneous GPS
navigation and Wi-Fi hotspot sharing
during an all-day on location shoot down
in Seattle this is by far my favorite
thing about active phones I mean I still
end up charging every night but most
people would easily get two days or more
with some of the clever power saving
features in the Android 7 nougat version
of Samsung experience but wait a second
don't active phones have a third awesome
selling point ah yes the programmable
button on the left that with the it's a
big speed button just like the rest of
Samsung's current lineup now I mean at
least they let you disable it for
accidental presses now but I'm still
gonna copy/paste my usual spiel about
how they should allow Native
reprogramming
you know like they used to speaking of
copy paste the camera including the
front-facing iris scanner that I still
don't find as fast or reliable as the
fingerprint reader is literally copy
pasted from the Galaxy s8 and that's a
good thing I never noticed any
difference in image quality or launch
times on the rear 12 megapixel camera
that records 4k video and up to 30 fps
and while it doesn't have a dual sensor
system like the node 8 for optical zoom
or fake bokeh which I'll be calling Foca
from now on honestly that matters way
less to me these days than a quality
front-facing camera and this one gets me
better results than even the iPhone 8 I
mean it's not like I take a bunch of
selfies with my duck face friends in the
club or whatever but when I'm hanging
out with my kids I end up capturing a
lot more moments thanks to the wider
angle lens and it's decent low-light
performance just remember before you use
it make sure you turn off all the cheesy
face shaping and skins moving effects
now let's talk gripes the Samsung
experience on this phone is not the
smoothest experience this device crashes
more than every other phone that I've
reviewed combined it's not everyday or
anything but it's too much everything
from random reboots to the screen
staying on with the clock stops so
clearly not working until I hard reset
to the phone clearly being working like
it'll lock and unlock with the buttons
but the touch screen is totally
unresponsive until I hard reset it and
before you ask I checked AT&amp;amp;T site to
make sure that I was running the latest
software so Samsung an update would be
super swell and while you're at it you
can't move and expand it lists around on
me while I am swiping stuff away from it
and fix this one too when you hit the
fingerprint sensor which I still don't
like on the back by the way
see there you go that's what it's
supposed to do dump you on the home
screen perfect but if you hit it
sometimes when the phone isn't actually
locked for some reason I then have to
swipe before I can see the home screen
why would I want that I mean it's not
like it matters that much the
instability that I've experienced
already rules this phone out as a daily
driver for me but if that could be fixed
high otherwise really like it it's like
it's like a dog that's smart friendly
playful and pees on your stuff it just
needs a little bit more work speaking of
needing a little bit more work if you
were just thinking you know my phone
needs a little bit more work I want to
spend some time making it look awesome

scratches well debrand has got you
