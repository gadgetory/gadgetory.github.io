more specifically it's not the first
time I've ever seen one but my early
experiences with Z box just weren't that
great the hardware was slow usually
Intel Atom or early AMD APU based and
they didn't have decent graphics so from
a gaming perspective they were basically
irrelevant a global leader in tech
recruiting is celebrating geek pride by
giving away 10 amazing tech prizes for
more info visit the modus Facebook page
or modus com step forward a few years
and two things have happened number one
is that hardware is much more efficient
at number two is that it's much more
powerful so this same form factor I mean
it really looks almost identical to the
old ones can have way cooler and faster
guts in it so let's get physical with
our Z Box II that's for epic gaming by
the way series mini PC overall there are
no surprises here it can lay flat it can
stand upright on the included foot and
it can be bolted to a basic compatible
monitor or TV with the included adaptor
also included in the Box is a couple of
antennas for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth a DVI
to VGA adapter a manual a driver disk
which you may actually need because no
tax website is so low and the screws for
the base amount for the PC itself we'll
start at the front where we've got
headphone and microphone jacks an SD
card reader a USB 3 port an IR sensor
and a power switch a funny thing here is
as otech couldn't decide which way was
up for the labels on the front ports
it's a minor issue but it's definitely
one that made me laugh on the right hand
side is another USB 3 port with a little
cover on it and a large exhaust vent on
the left we find two thumb screws to
open up the unit and the mount for the
foot and then the top is straight smooth
glossy plastic with an attractive orange
LED that you can actually turn off in
the vials but it's got a very muted glow
so I would personally leave it on the
bottom is the same thing but with a
bunch of ventilation holes and
led and this is all for the internal
cooling fan I guess there's also four
little rubber feet here now speaking of
cool most of the interesting i/o is on
the back where we find power in our
antennas HDMI and dual link DVI out to
USB 3 ports an optical audio out and
finally dual Ethernet ports which feels
like a very strange inclusion to me I
would have preferred a mini DisplayPort
output or something but maybe next time
now all on a minute then normally these
kinds of small form-factor pcs are
tightly integrated and difficult to take
apart why did this thing have thumb
screws over on the side with the foot
mount well truthfully you're intended to
take it apart it's available as a
bare-bones where you put in your own
Drive in memory or as a prebuilt
that you just install an operating
system on so once we get inside we can
see the large 6800 Ultra style heatsink
that cool is a dual core Intel Core i5
that runs at 1.6 gigahertz base and up
to 2.6 gigahertz with turbo boost and a
gtx 860m with 2 gigs of ram here we see
the included Intel wireless AC and
Bluetooth 4.0 card and finally over here
we've got the one terabyte hard drive
that's included with the pre-built one
but can be removed if we pull out that
one screw to reveal two ddr3 sodium
slots one of which is populated with an
8 gig module now evaluating the
performance of this thing could have
been as simple as running our suite of
games and measuring the FPS but I don't
think it really would have been fair to
a product like this I don't see this as
a normal PC it's more like a console in
terms of size and utility so I took a
little bit of a different approach using
the same image quality settings that we
found looked the same as a ps4 back when
we did our image quality comparison with
battlefield 4 and Assassin's Creed 4 we
wanted to see if this tiny PC a mere 6
months after we did that video could
deliver the same gaming experience at
1080 as a current gen console and it did
in fact it was about 10% faster than our
value gaming PC at the time which was
able to achieve the same minimum frame
rate of 30 fps
that the consul's target so this one did
it quite comfortably and it managed to
that while being much much smaller than
the PC smaller than a console and
whisper quiet even while gaming I'm
really really impressed but with that
said the en 760 does cost quite a bit
more than a PlayStation 4 so whether
it's worth your hard earned money is a
pretty tough call and only you can make
that decision once you've considered the
pros and cons it is a great package if
you don't mind the spend enos of it the
cooling fan is incredibly quiet its
well-built fully featured and tiny
enough to hide behind the TV or pretty
much anywhere else so it has that
gadgety sex appeal and it's fairly
likely to achieve spouse approval if you
have a process for that in your house
given that it'll be out of sight but the
big drawback of course is that while
you'll have the functionality of a
desktop like a lot more versatility than
a console you won't get the upgrade
ability or customizability of a true
desktop PC so there you have it guys I
love that ZOTAC had the guts to build
something like this and I hope it's a
massive success because given what they
can jam in a notebook these days there
is obviously more powerful hardware that
could make its way into this kind of a
form factor if the demand was strong
enough but with steam in-home streaming
finally available theoretically we don't
even need gaming machines on our TVs
anymore
but it's hardly perfect so especially if
I had some ddr3 or two and a half inch
drive lying around this epic gaming
series would likely be getting a look
from me if nothing else even if I didn't
end up going forward and I went for a
very low power just streaming box with
an h.264 decoder but guys let me know
your thoughts our powerful gaming box is
hooked up to TVs dead or do you like the
directions otac is going in here or
would you prefer just a larger one in
the first place speaking of direction
here's how to do something fun on
audible.com find some celebrity you like
and search his or her name to see if
they've narrated anything interesting I
picked Jason Alexander of Seinfeld Fame
because I don't know who knows maybe I
hate my ears
never buds get this it turns out that
there's a 90 our new King James Bible
reading with its own musical score and
some seriously heavy adding voice actors
including Jason Alexander now you could
buy that for just shy of $40 or you
could get it for one credit as part of
