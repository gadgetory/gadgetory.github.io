the camera man's office because I
finally have my own legitimate office
camera if you could do a quick 360 here
and pan around check out the new office
yeah there that was awkward
so today we're gonna be unboxing the
Kingston SSDs series solid-state drive
this is a 128 gig drive and it is part
of their notebook upgrade kit series of
drive so it's a V Series Drive which
means it's a little bit slower than a V
Plus but still a very fast SSD let me
just see if I can find the specs on the
box here ok you know what no so I'm
gonna cheat a little bit
I'm gonna go Kingston SSDs now on the
NCIX website ok so we've got the V
Series Gen 2 128 gig you can see it's
actually on special this week if you
wanted to buy this without the laptop
upgrade kit it's only 250 499 apparently
I unboxed it once already without the
laptop upgrade kit but um I guess that
doesn't really matter there's no wow
that was when I was using that table in
my house that's not a very good place to
do an unboxing so I'll be doing them in
my new office that'll be way better okay
so the 128 gig is up to 200 megabytes
per second read and 160 megabytes per
second right and check this up see this
drawer I'm gonna be keeping a knife in
it yeah so now we've got even that is
all taken care of so let's get this
opened up and have a look and exactly
what Kingston includes with their 128
gig notebook upgrade kit so first of all
we have the outer sleeve that comes off
and I guess there's something on here ok
so it says it's fast reliable and silent
that pretty much goes for all decent
quality SSDs these days and the Kingston
one is definitely decent quality if not
excellent quality so oh well that has a
Kingston logo on the plastic then we
have a driver disc oh no this is quality
software this is really useful then so
basically what makes this a laptop
upgrade kit is that it has everything
you need to take your existing laptop
hard drive and transfer it directly onto
this kingston SSD so you use the hard
drive cloning kit along with the
included two-and-a-half inch hard drive
enclosure so you throw your SSD in the
drive enclosure or vice versa I guess
then you use a USB cable to plug it into
your computer then you use the cloning
software to completely copy all of your
old hard drive contents onto the new SSD
you've also got a molex to SATA adapter
for power for whatever reason okay not
really sure why let's get the drive
opened up and we'll have a look at the
SSD itself okay so it's got a nice sort
of dark black-ish grayish finish on it
you can see this is an evaluation SSD so
it is not for resale the warranty is
void if you removed this particular
screw over here you've got mounting
options for two and a half inch drives
on both the sides as well as on the
bottom so you're gonna be able to mount
this in any laptop okay it is a thin
drive so it's not going to not fit in a
laptop because it's too thick I've seen
that before
with something like the Seagate
Velociraptor even those tuna half-inch
it's actually too thick so that's
something to bear in mind and I guess
that pretty much covers it it's got a
kingston label on the top which is all
shiny and then we've got our SATA power
as well as SATA to data connectors at
the back and cameraman wants me to have
sort of a closer look at the drive
enclosure that's included so this is a
very very basic drive enclosure because
I guess it's pretty much intended to be
used once though actually here okay so
we'll show the installation procedure
why not it's not easy you just slide off
the top slide the SSD in it clips in
just like that so it's not gonna come
out and then you close it that was
incredibly easy you know this is
probably the easiest to install external
drive enclosure I've ever seen and it
comes for free with the drive so you
can't really complain yeah there you
slide it on from the top just like that
and then you got your you know I here
why don't we just see if this works
there I'm gonna plug it into my USB
cable on my computer here okay power
light turns on I'm gonna just sort of
close my reports and my
and this while the cameraman doesn't
look at my screen doesn't look at my
screen closing all my stuff there we go
okay so my devices are ready to use and
I can go into my computer and I can
access it just like no no I can't okay
well what I'll do actually this is an
interesting tip not everyone knows how
to do this if you right-click computer
and then click manage and in theory
it'll bring up the prompt if your
computer is a little bit faster than
mine where you can actually manage your
drives let's try that one more time
there we go it is adding a snap in
Chrome soul whatever that means I've
never seen this take that long there we
go finally Disk Management and that is
where you are able to initialize a new
disk format an existing one you can
actually rearrange the drive letters so
if you want to change your your C Drive
to your Z Drive if you feel like it or
your D Drive to your X Drive you can do
that in here it is going incredibly slow
and I can't figure out what I was doing
that but either way that's where you do
it so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the Kingston SSDs know V
series notebook upgrade kit and this is
the 128 gigabyte version</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
