to you by HyperX gaming products make
sure you click their logo to check out
the great gaming content on their
YouTube channel as well as phantom glass
the ultimate gorilla glass screen
protector for your mobile device alright
guys we're here at origin checking out
the origin PC 15s at the origin PC evo
15s sorry about that it is a 15 inch
screen with a 1080p screen which is made
out of an IPS panel pretty fantastic it
is under an inch thick it is four pounds
that's an 870 m3 gigabyte graphics card
16 gigs of memory and I 747 10 HQ it has
dual 128 gig M SATA drives combining
together to be good 256 gigs it like I
said 1080p screen or a 3k screen if you
go for that option but you don't have to
go for that option so you get to 1080p
one which would be a lot cheaper
it's a 15-inch screen so that's honestly
probably fine you can get Windows 7 or
Windows 8.1 on this you don't have to
get one or the other it has an 8
different color backlit keyboard it has
dying audio it's most of the finishes
gonna be made out of metal the one we
have here is actually a prototype so
you're gonna see some carbon-fiber
finishes around the screen and on the
top of it but that will be replaced with
more of a metal finish knotted not that
not the look of a carbon fiber finish
although the also the origin logo that
is on the top of it as well can be
replaced with a each tin origin logo or
an etched in whatever the heck you want
that is a customizable option as well
for i/o on the left side of the unit we
have a Kensington lock your power dual
USB 3.0 and audio jacks I'm just going
to move this around to the right side of
the unit where we have another USB 3 an
SD card slot HDMI a mini DisplayPort and
Ethernet and a little bit of mic on the
right hand side as well we have what
looks like ventilation ports on the back
and a little bit on the sides with
speakers on the back as well so that is
the origin PC laptop we've seen that
here at PAX thank you guys for watching
check out hyper X's youtube channel
they've been releasing a whole bunch of
really cool stuff lately
and they've blown up in size because of
the cool stuff they've been releasing
they're not just releasing product

check out also check out phantom glass
as both HyperX and phantom glass helped
us come here this year so thank you guys
