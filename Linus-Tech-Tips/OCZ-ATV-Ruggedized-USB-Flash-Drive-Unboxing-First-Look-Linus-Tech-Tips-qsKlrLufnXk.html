and yes I said ocz I said it because it
sounds better that way no matter what I
do if I say ocz then someone complains
that I say ocz then someone else
complains so I prefer ocz so there this
is there a TV ruggedized shock resistant
and waterproof USB 2.5 it's a 16 gig
drive it is available in a variety of
capacities though and we're going to go
ahead and open it up mostly for giggles
because I'm pretty sure everyone has
seen a flash drive at some point in
their life I still remember my first
flash drive it was actually eight Meg's
and back then that was like a big deal
because I could actually like I could
put photos on it and transport those two
to my classes are like like I could put
larger documents than just like Word
documents you know I could put like a
powerpoint on it and bring it to school
that was like it was like high-tech at
the time to like I actually had a friend
bring it back for me from from Beijing
because you couldn't even buy them here
and with some weird brand it was like it
was like some kind of weird like
bluey-green color and it's like a cheap
plastic it broke shortly but anyway
that's neither here nor there the ATV is
not a weird bluey-green it looks pretty
cool and ruggedized it's rubber and it
kind of bounces as you can see so the
likelihood of it actually breaking is
fairly slim and then check this out I
mean how high class is that now you
won't lose your cap you just plug it in
and you put the cap on there you pull
the cap off there you put it on there
look at that it's like a fake it's like
a fake USB port and it's also made of
rubber with little ocz logo on it so
yeah they call that out as a unique
chained cap holder so that is a highly
innovative thank you for checking out my
video on the ATV please note there is an
indicator LED here which will tell you
when it is I've being written to or not
written to so if you have a Mac and you
want to you
drag it to the trash can and then wait
forever because that's how max work you
can see when the light turns off and you
don't have to pull it out and have your
mac complain at you don't forget to
