brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom glass for the best
darn screen protectors out there as well
as hyperx alright guys welcome to our
first video at CES we're at the msi
sweet checking out their first
motherboard of the day which is the z97
gaming 6 this motherboard features the
world's first type C USB 3.1 connector
and while it's still a prototype you
might be able to see it sometime around
March also time time around March
they're trying to work with case
manufacturers to get front panel headers
you might be able to see USB type-c
connectors on the front of your case as
well which is quite cool as I said it's
a prototype so it doesn't actually
feature everything thus far so you won't
be able to get like the power 2 point 0
standard of 100 watts but you will be
able to get that awesome data transfer
speed that comes with USB 3.1 now this
was my first time trying out USB type-c
my first observation was that I didn't
plug it in enough it's actually quite a
tough connector to fully plug-in but it
locks very nicely which is really good
to see in this type of connector we know
with micro USB and stuff like that that
durability can kind of be a big issue
but USB type-c supports theoretically up
to 10,000 ish unplug zandri plugs which
is really good the next board on our hit
list is the x 99 a gaming 9 ack and what
this board features is dual USB 3.1
plugs on the back of the motherboard now
again like with the previous board this
is just kind of supporting the 3.1 data
speed standard not like the power to
point a 100 watt standard but that's
fine is pretty much no devices will
support that right now anyways speaking
of device support this is compatible
with USB 3.0 devices unlike type C where
you can't plug that connector in because
it's not the same thing although the end
on the other side might work this one is
compatible with both but you won't be
able to get that speed advantage unless
you have a device which is also USB 3.1
on the other side now they did have an
example here of a device that is kind of
under a box doing USB 3.1 transfer
speeds we see when it's on USB 3.1 we
get about 700 in something on the
crystal dis marked bench that they're
running and about 400 and something with
are running on three point 0 a very nice
speed increase this board will probably
be released sometime around q
one most likely it's less of a prototype
board than the type-c board we were
looking at earlier and while I know some
of you are going to jump in the comments
go Oh a thunderbolt already has 20
gigabit per second coming out soon
that's true but not as many devices are
supporting it and it's often more
expensive so with USB we are going to
probably see a faster iteration of
products and more acceptance amongst the
market so you're probably going to see
us be around more often also one thing
to note with be like not supporting
power and stuff like that is if you're
jumping really early on these boards
there's going to be not that many
devices that support it anyways and
having two plugs also isn't really that
big of a deal because again not that
many devices are actually going to
support it and we've already seen that
while you might have a ton of USB 3.1
plugs on the back your board you're
mainly using a USB to point out devices
to plug into them already although that
might change in the future that's still
a thing so I don't think it's super
important as of right now alright guys
thank you for watching our first video
at CES at the MSI sweet if you want to
see all the rest of our CES videos be
sure to sit a subscribed to Linus tech
tips also thank you to phantom glass for
sending us here this year will hopefully
be releasing a cool little video of
theirs fairly soon where I don't know I
can't spoil it but make sure you stay
tuned because it'll be fairly
interesting also Kingston's hyperx
YouTube channel is pretty cool you
should check it out they've been growing
a lot lately because they're releasing
some pretty interesting content so be
sure to check that out as well and i'll
see you guys in the next CES video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
