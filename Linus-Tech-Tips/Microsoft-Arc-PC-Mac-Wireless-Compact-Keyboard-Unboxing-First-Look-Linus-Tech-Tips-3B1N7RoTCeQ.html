yet but we do have a sample here to show
you today this is a wireless style that
works that's their little slogan for it
Wireless PC and Mac keyboard and they're
they're famous okay yeah that it's style
that works so it's a stylish small
little keyboard that's meant to be I
would imagine well here's what I would
use it for okay I'm not gonna tell you
what it's for cuz I don't know what they
intended for but I would use this from
the coach to control my media center
because it's exactly the kind of size
that you can comfortably put it in your
lap but still be able to comfortably
type actually we'll find out if we can
comfortably type once I actually get it
out of the box but okay here we go why
don't we see what what Microsoft has to
say about it
meet the art keyboard with beautiful
curves and a compact design it's at home
wherever you are okay so in my case on
the couch
excellent you can show it off clean
lines and an eye-catching shape
compliment your style here there
anywhere something about using it
anywhere and be free also something
about using it anywhere they have a
little picture of the nano transceiver
for wireless freedom
okay so let's find the seals and I do
not have anything even remotely
resembling a knife on me okay here hold
on actually just a sec I have a fork and
I will just use that to pierce the
sticker and then hopefully the whole
sticker will come away from for me and
then we'll go from there
or I could just peel the sticker bear
with me here just gonna peel the sticker
up because my fork has lasagna on it and
I think that that would be not quite
sanitary especially because like well
you know old lasagna isn't really a very
sanitary things you put on stuff that's
my wisdom for the day okay so here we
are it is covered in a little cloth
sheath that is to protect it from
scratches I'm assuming and also to make
the presentation of this is actually
excellent
this so you open up your box you get a
little sheath pocket envelope thing here
made of like a nice cloth II material
then you get oh this is nice so this is
would be a CD and probably your users
guide start here helpfully labeled even
so you write here so this must be a
QuickStart guide so they show you how to
put in the batteries put in the wireless
transceiver and then press the buttons
in order to link it up oh cool oh that's
a neat system so basically to turn the
keyboard okay to turn the keyboard on or
off press and hold function and escape
until the battery light changes and then
that's it huh
can you dope okay then you've got a
Microsoft product guide here which
probably includes some warranty
information as well okay two triple A
batteries it's not a big fan of triple-a
batteries but when you try to make a
device as compact as possible sometimes
it's unavoidable it's just that they're
sort of them more as expensive as double
A's and you don't get more battery life
out of them etcetera etc they're not
really my favorite thing but let's get
this our keyboard out of here that is
nice actually
so you can see it has a slight curve to
it hence the name arc and on the bottom
is a cleverly designed little
compartment for the double or triple A
batteries to nilam all screwed up for
the triple-a batteries and then right
here is the little nano transceiver is
that I love it held in by a magnet look
at that so you never have to worry about
it coming up as long as you know you
don't have a curious toddler that comes
along and eats it anyway that's really
convenient and then the top of the
keyboard itself so I'm gonna apologize
in advance for the crotch shot here I'm
just gonna go ahead and put this on my
lap and actually that's not bad you can
comfortably reach all the buttons it is
a very standard layout so you can see
that you've got long shift keys on both
sides you've got a long Enter key so it
doesn't have any of the weird bilingual
keys that cut off your shift or the the
strangely located slash key that would
cut your backspace down to the
we're I mean if you have small hands
reaching a back space beyond about here
is completely unreasonable so yeah I I
personally hate the short backspace key
you've got all of your function keys no
you do not oh this is interesting okay
in order to save space what they've done
with the layout is a they've only got
one Windows key so there's no Windows
key on the right hand side that's a
function key oh and this appears to be a
mouse that is something I didn't know
that oh no these are your arrows okay so
here are all the things that they've
managed to make more compact they've
removed the Windows key put in a
function key they've turned the control
the right control into the arrow keys
which is a one d-pad button okay then up
here they've actually got F 1 2 F 6 and
then you use the function key in order
to access f 7 to F 12 great that works
for me and then we've got all of our
home and page up page down and print
screen all in for buttons right here and
then they've even included media buttons
so you've got mute louder and quieter
and then delete and insert but no no
play stop pause that's a little bit
disappointing given what I personally
would be using something like this for
but I mean really if you have a Media
Center you should probably own one of
these already anyway it's like the most
useful 15 dollars or whatever it costs
that I've ever spent on a hardware
component in fact I own three anyway
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the arc I still think
the coolest feature is the magnetic
transceiver that's so cool thank you
again for checking out my unboxing of
the Microsoft arc</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
