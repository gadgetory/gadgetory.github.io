and don't worry we'll revisit that
concept soon enough but for now we've
got a fun way to address some critical
feedback from our viewers about the
choice to use second-hand components for
our builds now you can see the original
series and the machines that Linus and I
constructed in the links here and here
but while the showdown between Linus's
kind of all-rounder q 6600 platform and
my r9 290 with a tin can around it was
interesting it left out the option that
many of you of you pointed out which was
new stuff now in our minds we bought
used to gain an advantage in price for
performance over new inbox but without
actually testing it how do we know how
much of an advantage we actually gained
let's find out stay subscribed to Linus
tech tips for more adventures like this
Corsairs h ATI GT and h100 IG TX all in
one liquid coolers improve both the
appearance and cooling of your PC click
now to learn more so how do we compare
our use machines to something new well
we can give ourselves a fixed budget to
put together a new $300 machine for
comparison but I'm pretty sure a lot of
you would cry foul because $300 isn't
really enough for new parts and if we
did this back ourselves then we could
potentially rig it so we decided on a
$400 us budget which allowed Linus and
I'd to combine our machines with the
best parts of each and challenge the
form to spec out a rig with brand new
pieces to try and put it in its place
they had to factory and stuff like
shipping and taxes in to their price but
we're allowed to shop from anywhere in
the US or Canada this gave them actually
a number of advantages they were able to
use a 400 dollar budget instead of 380
which ours totaled and that was in u.s.
funds instead of Canadian which makes it
a lot more valuable currently and lastly
they're able to shop from any US stores
which gave them a generally lower markup
than Canadian stores just in case then
we took to Twitter to pull more people
in and had people vote on the users
submitted builds it was a fairly close
battle between members Lord gaben and
Sauron but in the end lord gaben won
with over 45 votes - and I actually
didn't think that Lord gaben's build was
the strongest submission and ended up
picking our own editor's choice
community build to compete with and we
went with STR Mapes that leaves us with
the Waterloo cook wishing four thousand
in one quarter rocking a Core 2 quad
q6600 hey Kix of ddr2 ram a 500 watt
power point and in r9 290 with a 2-0 for
we are controlling CPU cooler with a
spark cooler strapped to it in the other
corner we've got lord gaben shrine with
an 86 6100 k 4 gigs of ram a 400 watt
power supply and it's door 1980 and in
the third quarter
it's kind of triangles going on last the
arm is prometheus reaching an X for 866
gigs of ram before turning one tars one
another oh I actually don't have an r9
280 so we upgraded both the Prometheus
and the shrine to an r9 280x and just
decided to make it a little bit more
fair we just didn't overclock it there's
three main performance determining parts
here we have the CPU the GPU and the RAM
all these machines have their CPU is
overclocked to varying degrees but only
the GPU of the three of machine 4000 is
actually overclocked for CPU the third
machine 4000 and prometheus are sitting
on quad cores but the Q 6600 is running
a little slower at 3.2 gigahertz
compared to the 4 gigahertz of the x-48
60 K also don't forget they run a
completely different architectures the
big outlier here is lord gaben shrine
with a dual-core a6 6400 K running a lot
faster at 4.4 gigahertz but remember two
cores instead of four for GPU things are
much more similar both being submitted
with an AR ni 280 and resulting with an
r9 280x running at the same speed while
the thrift machine 4000 is sporting an
r9 290 running at about a thousand
megahertz ram gets interesting again
though check out this video to see what
Linus's talks about the differences
between ddr3 and ddr4 but while going
all the way down to ddr2 cause our
thrift machine 4000 any issues or will
its greater capacity and proper dual
channel operation compared to the
prometheus is 6 gigs and the shrines for
gigs be worth it in the end
time to find it now as we go through the
results here some of you will
undoubtedly point out on the forum that
this isn't the whole equation and in
conclusion while our thrift machine 4000
may be doing quite well in the
performance results there are many
potential issues when buying used
hygiene for example Linus had to spend a
fair amount of time getting his machine
to an acceptable level of cleanliness
and missing accessories again Linus had
to hunt through boxes for more than a
couple of missing things while building
his BC something that may not be an
issue for the seasoned techies out there
but folks who don't have been
spare parts of hardware and whatnot this
may be a show-stopping issue for you
while you wait for parts and of course
use parts can come bruised or an even
damaged for example again Linus's case
came with some scratched parts and
missing a foot maybe not a huge deal in
the end but not great then you have even
more issues solar may ship you a do a
component or straight-up scam you if you
aren't careful enough and or if you're
just unlucky and even then some things
may come with a two-week warranty as
they sometimes do with eBay but who
knows if they'll even be properly
honored in the end
and while the promises of a lifetime
warranty for BFG tech customers who
bought their cards new probably stung at
least if you buy from a reputable
retailer your butt is probably covered
even if a manufacturer does go out of
business it's hard to get that kind of
protection shopping secondhand and the
pain train keeps on coming sort of parts
longevity is actually not a clear win
either way a lot of people are going to
point at the used machines here and say
well they'll die sooner they'll have
some problem with them and their right
to some degree but don't forget many of
the new machine spec tody on the forum
we're using terrible power supplies that
we would generously described as super
sketchy and while both the use machines
we're using well-built continuous power
and tech power supplies so in final
conclusion the best strategy may be to
buy some things new and some things used
and it's just going to come down to your
risk tolerance we would recommend
getting your case new so that it's in
pristine condition and comes with all of
its accessories and whatnot and your
storage new since losing data sucks so
freaking much and it's comfortable
knowing that as long as you didn't drop
your hard drive it probably hasn't been
dropped CPU and RAM can probably be
bought used as they're very rarely fail
and RAM often has a no-questions-asked
lifetime warranty but other things can
largely rely on how good of a deal you
can get things like motherboard or video
card will depend heavily on their
current condition and warranty coverage
status as well let me know what you guys
think is a good strategy and speaking of
good strategies I will be attending PAX
East and surprise surprise
our friends from Intel will be
as well actually that's not much of a
surprise but anyways they usually have
some pretty sweet community giveaways to
go along with their presence and PAX
East is no different this year they'll
be hosting a hashtag my Intel build
contest which is focused on sharing your
favorite Intel based PC build whether
it's one you've done yourself or one you
see on the show for PAX East you can
enter whether you're attending the show
or not it doesn't really matter just
submit a picture of your favorite Intel
based build on vine Twitter or Instagram
with the hashtag my Intel build and
you're entered into a chance to win one
of three Intel Core i7 processors you
can enter as many times as you want and
you can showcase as many different
systems as you want just make sure that
use the hashtag with each entry the
contest is already started and it closes
on March 13th
so get your entries in now alright guys
don't forget to comment on the forum or
I guess in the comments down below what
kind of build you guys liked more and if
you guys think buying new or use for
different parts is a good idea also a
shout-out to the kind of build contest
thing in the builds new builds and
planning section of the forum it's it's
a pinned at the top and they constantly
have different contests going on for
different people spec you know different
systems running this was really fun but
they run that all the time and that's a
really cool community so be sure to
check that out also while you're on the
forum if you click the support us link
in the top right hand corner it can
bring you to a really cool page where
you can see all of our sponsors and
stuff and maybe even change your Amazon
links so that we get a small kickback
whenever you buy things that helps out a
ton in the in the description below the
video you'll be able to see a shirt link
where you'll buy things not based on
Star Wars and yeah anyways don't forget
to subscribe if you haven't already like
the video dislike the video depending on
if you're a Star Trek II or Star Wars
kind of person this is a shirt that you
can buy from Linus tech tips that Linus
just took off he's half naked off screen
right now anyways guys thanks for
watching I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
