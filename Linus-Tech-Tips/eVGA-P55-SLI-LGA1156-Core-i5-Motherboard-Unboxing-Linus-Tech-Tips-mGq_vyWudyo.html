sli so this is not their highest end p55
board but it's no slouch either so you
do get support for pretty much the full
p55 feature set so you got crossfire sli
pretty good erm solution all of that
stuff now this is positioned just under
there for the wind board so there are
some things that are missing I'm just
gonna get this out here it's actually
very similar-looking board though so
here we go let's gets get into the
accessory package so we got our driver
CD okay then we've got what seems to be
the same guide that they had with the
fur the wind board maybe a couple slight
differences so that's your you're
getting started guide and oh no it is
different it is different it has just
this board on it so there you go there's
your Quick Start visual guide this is
totally gonna get blown away here so
just just a sec yeah the wind's coming
ok so then we've got molex to SATA
adapter and to SATA cables so quite a
lot less in terms of accessory package
here then we've got two USB and one
firewire port on a little pci bracket ok
so let's take out this divider here ok
more accessories so there's our black
flexible SLI bridge there's our i/o
shield thought that padding on the back
of it that's a kind of a new thing then
we've got our motherboard manual uh yeah
not really anything particularly
interesting about that all right let's
get the board out here because that's
the that's what you folks are paying to
see not that anyone really pays to watch
videos on YouTube whatever ok so there
we've got our desiccant package in there
that keeps your board nice and dry and
safe during transportation ok let's get
into the board so some major differences
between this and the classified right
off the top we don't have support for
that little that little break out with
all the power reset clear CMOS all that
stuff so you'll actually find all the
buttons on board here there's your reset
power clear seamos there's your your
post screen your debug screen all that
kind of stuff let me have a look you've
got that same little lit designer sort
of thing there that's really cool and
then I really liked this on the for the
win board you've got your little step
step guide on how to install the CPU
right on top of the CPU socket very neat
three two one done okay then we've got
support for the usual dual-channel ddr3
memory so you can see that here the
color scheme of this board is kind of
all black and gray so it's a very high
performance sort of looking color scheme
another big difference here when we look
at the power connectors is this board
has only one 8-pin connector the for the
wind board actually has two so you can
deliver ridiculous amounts of current to
your CPU the 24-pin you'll find on the
right-hand edge of the board just
exactly where it's supposed to be and
then let's see what else we've got here
peel off this sticker ah there's a nice
brushed aluminum finish on that chipset
heatsink I really like to see that then
we've got six SATA ports all on the edge
of the board exactly where they need to
be and let's have a look at the at the
IO here so we've got one two three
fourth only six USB ports on the back
but they did give you that I Oh panel
thing we've got our digital audio
clarity mouse button a ps2 keyboard port
then we have a couple of eSATA ports one
firewire port two gigabit ethernet ports
and 7.1 audio anyway thank you for
checking out my blog on EVGA p55
