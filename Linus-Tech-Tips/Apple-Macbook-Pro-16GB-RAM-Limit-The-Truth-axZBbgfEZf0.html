device for sure but we've seen the
criticisms that between the lack of an
SD card reader it's extremely limited
hardware specs considering who it's
purportedly aimed at and an i/o setup
that will leave the vast majority of
people either reaching for adapters or
buying new cables altogether it just
doesn't seem geared towards
professionals at all and on the latest
LAN show we actually threw our two cents
into the pile every 13-inch MacBook Pro
has no dedicated GPU I'm sold no one
will ever need more than eight gigs of
RAM they don't even have to drill course
they don't even have quad-core
processors no one needs more than two
cores Apple didn't bother to respond to
our comments directly I guess Tim Cook
doesn't watch the LAN show for some
reason but one issue has apparently
generated so much discussion that
Apple's Phil Schiller made an official
statement to the verge defending their
decision to limit the MacBook Pro to 16
gigabytes of RAM they claimed that
putting more than 16 gigs of fast RAM
into a notebook design at this time
would require a memory system that
consumes much more power and wouldn't be
efficient enough for a laptop but how
much battery does RAM use is this a
valid defense let's investigate
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade
make it yours at the link below Apple
will have to forgive me when I
immediately raised an eyebrow like
Dwayne the rock Johnson although I can't
do it nearly as well when they announced
that not only would their base
configurations max out at 16 gigs but
that you wouldn't be able to upgrade it
later on consumer stuff I find this type
of locking down less offensive but
they're doing a lot of stuff that just
seems to be designed to make their
hardware less repairable and more
disposable I mean MacBook Pro batteries
are glued to the case and this situation
is no different with the memory it's
soldered on to the logic board Apple's
official explanation was that a memory
system with more than 16 gigs of RAM
would draw too much power from the
laptop like I said earlier but is that
really true it's 32 gigabytes really too
much for a mobile platform to handle
well especially considering many MacBook
Pro buyers are professional content
creators or chrome users who might
actually make use of all of that memory
to find out we looked at the power
consumption of different memory
configurations not just in a laptop but
in a desktop as well just to dive a
little bit deeper our benchmark on all
tests was 5 minutes of the memory stress
test only in I 264 extreme for our first
test we use 8 gigs 6 of Corsair
Vengeance lpx ddr4 on our usual test
bench in 8 16 and 32 gigabyte
configurations there is a 20 watt Delta
in our highest and lowest amounts of RAM
but was this due to more gigabytes or
more RAM sticks so we put our two sticks
of Corsair lpx against four sticks of a
data xpg ddr4 since the a data sticks
were only four gigs apiece both setups
came in at a total of 16 gigabytes of
RAM the four sticks drew a little bit
more power but not much more as there
was only a 5 watt difference we also
looked at how different Ram voltages
affected power consumption putting up
two sticks of our 1.2 volt Corsair LP
against two sticks of 1.35 volt corsair
dominator as with our other tests we
made sure to turn on XMP profiles to
make sure they were actually drawing the
voltages indicated on the box the 11
watt difference was definitely more than
we were expecting all in all the
differences between our different Ram
setups for desktop weren't insignificant
so is there really something to apple's
claim time to dig deeper so we switched
over to an Acer predator 15 laptop as it
uses the same skylake architecture CPU
type and ddr4 Ram as our desktop test
bench and then we paired it with crucial
and a pacer so-dimms that is laptop
memory obviously we would have liked to
have tested this on one of the new
MacBook Pros themselves but thanks to
its completely non swappable Ram this
wasn't really an option after testing 1
&amp;amp; 2 6 of both 8 and 16 gigabyte modules
the difference in battery drain was
almost negligible the difference between
one stick of 8 gigs and two of 16
remember that's a total of 32 gigabytes
was only 105 milliwatts hours in each
scenario the memory stress test drained
about 4% of the Predators battery so
there was no massive spike in discharge
rate when we upped our system to 32 gigs
now admittedly this isn't an apples to
apples comparison as all the laptops
laying around were ddr4 gaming
windows-based models but thanks to J
deck standards one ddr4 low-power chip
is less different from another than you
might think
which leaves us to wonder if raw power
consumption of more chips wasn't the
issue
what exactly did Apple mean when they
said more than 16 gigabytes of memory
wouldn't be efficient enough for a
notebook Linus's theory is that using up
more PCB space for memory chips could
have eaten into the internal space that
Apple preferred to use for a bigger
battery John thinks that's bull and
speculates that it's a planned
obsolescence move as for me I'm not sure
what
I do know is that the truth is out there
and you should leave a comment down
below with your opinion as well and also
by the way hi Louis I'm assuming you're

the description down below thanks for
watching guys this video sucked you knew
what to do but if it was awesome get
subscribed the like button or check out
where to buy the stuff that we featured
in this video on Amazon like laptops
that have 32 gigs of RAM also link to
the description is our merch stores you
can buy cool stuff although I think this
sweater is like sold out and not in our
merch store and stuff but you know there
might be another drop of those someday
someone's going to kill me because
that's not actually going to happen but
anyway still worried about it also check
out the community forum which is linked
down below and now that you're done
doing all that you're probably wondering
what to watch next so check out this
video which is Tarin's evey 3 review
