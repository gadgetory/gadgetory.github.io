shout-out to Squarespace thanks for
allowing us to be here at CES 2016 this
my friends is the kind of stuff I get
really really excited about portability
and performance with no compromises I
was trying to find another P word it
didn't happen anyway this is the ROG XG
2 very creatively named the X is for
extreme the G is for Gophers and the 2
is for second generation none of which
is obviously right its external graphics
I don't know what the 2 is maybe they
have an internal project that God can
somewhere along the way but this one
looks like it turned out pretty darn
well so in terms of the size I would say
it's fairly comparable to that magma
thing that I checked out about three
years ago in terms of the functionality
it bears very very little similarity so
they've got one of those like badass
like I did plasma tube things going on
in the front this is a bit of a new look
for them I'm not sure if that's going to
make it into the final product or not
apparently yes that will make it into
the final product because this is not
the final product look the whole thing
just like comes apart so there's a
couple cooling fans on the top and what
they've got down there looks like a
completely custom PCB that is converting
to external DC power bricks so in this
case each of them is about a 220 watt
external brick into whatever connectors
you want there's actually a 24 pin ATX
connector in there although I don't know
what that would be for in this form
factor but what's actually connected to
it now is two PCI Express power
connectors and we have a geforce gtx
980ti running in here and it looks like
a soos has pretty much gotten around the
restrictions in terms of space for GPUs
by just making the box a little bit
bigger so you can have tall cards you
can have long cards you can have rear
blower cards you can put in pretty much
whatever you want but that doesn't mean
that the entire ecosystem will be
totally open asus has not yet determined
if the product while being definitely
not validated on other makers notebooks
will be compatible or whether we locked
out and I personally feel pretty
strongly it shouldn't be locked out
because if you're willing to buy the box
you've already given Asus your money so
let us know in the comments if you agree
with me in the meantime let's move on a
little bit further so it adds not just
display connectivity to your laptop not
ads not just more GPU horsepower but it
also acts as a USB hub and I wonder does
it have a LAN port back here or did you
not manage to squeeze that in there
looks like no LAN port unfortunately but
that's okay
so basically the way it works is it's
using a USB 3.1 type-c connector with
Thunderbolt 3 to get a PCI Express 4x
3.0 link to your graphics card which is
by the way more than enough that's about
equivalent to a PCIe Gen 1 16x slot
which is still not a bottleneck today so
they're running all kinds of benchmarks
over here on a mistery system that quite
frankly they're being total assholes
about and here it is so they're getting
a score of 14,000 in firestrike which is
pretty darn respectable you probably
have to have a quad-core CPU for that
yeah turns out they do so they've got a
skylake core i7 6700 HQ running on this
machine it's got 32 gigs of DDR 4 memory
a 512 gig nvme PCI Express SSD it's got
I don't know what else is they won't
tell me anything about it they're
letting me look at the system info in
3dmark
but what they will not tell me they'll
tell me that this processor the quad
core like 3.3 gigahertz
turbo processor they're telling me it
doesn't throttle but they're not telling
me how the crap they are doing it I
don't believe them that it's an early
prototype blah blah blah project that
doesn't even have a name it's
because the hinge on this thing is
gorgeous the build quality of it is
immaculate this is not an engineering
sample I don't buy it at all in terms of
i/o
it's got mini DisplayPort it's got two
USB type-c so one of those is for data
over to that external box and one of
them is actually for for charging power
it's got a headphone jack it's got a
couple USB 3.1 Zhai would guess but who
knows they're probably not going to tell
me that either it's got a mic it's got
an SD card slot and this thing is
gorgeous
are telling me the display is 1080p I
don't believe them because it doesn't
look it doesn't look like it
keyboard feels keep okay okay the
keyboards a bit mushy maybe that's
something they still have some work to
do on but basically if this is a
quad-core that doesn't throttle in this
form factor with that external box then
they basically nailed it now the one
Holy Grail thing is whether it can
survive being unplugged without causing
a system crash because you've
effectively just changed the graphics
card of a system on the fly you've
hot-plug the graphics card and let's
give them a couple seconds they're
advertising that it is functionality
that it will have they're not
necessarily saying that it works now so
maybe it doesn't work yet ah yes well I
wasn't going to leave the Asus booth
without breaking at least one demo so
there you go I broke it but they've got
hopefully at least a few more months to
get that fixed and I think that pretty
much wraps up these suits booth for me
thanks for checking out this video guys
and thanks to Squarespace for allowing
us to be here at CES 2016 covering the
show if you guys are looking to build a
website I think you know where to go
