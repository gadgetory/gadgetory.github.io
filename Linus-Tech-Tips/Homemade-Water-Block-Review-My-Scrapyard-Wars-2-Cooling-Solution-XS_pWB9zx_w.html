scrapyard Wars 3 which is started by the
way definitely you want to check that
out up there
it's awesome has gotten me thinking
about previous scrapyard Wars that we
did in scrapyard Wars - the highlight
for me was constructing my own water
block with the help of my neighbor who
has a C&amp;amp;C and I realized that while we
did benchmark the actual cooling
performance of my system
we never determined if it was cooled so
poorly because of the copper coil that I
was using to dissipate the heat or
because of the neighbor nader 5000 CPU
water block so today I'm going to be
doing a review of my own water block
that I built well with a lot of help in
scrapyard Wars - so come along for the
ride let's find out just how practical
building your own water block can be
compared to a pre-done solution
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting check
out the link in the video description to
learn more so I guess this is how
reviews usually start right is taking a
look at the product now if you watch
scrapyard worse to you'll already know a
lot about the construction of this block
but if you haven't then I'll give you
guys a quick rundown it was cut on a
custom made CNC that my neighbor
actually uses for his solar-powered
scoreboards business that he runs out of
his garage and is constructed out of two
pieces of metal so there's an aluminum
plate at the bottom I had originally
intended to use copper so that we
wouldn't be mixing metals but due to the
ease of working with aluminum we opted
for aluminum so there's an aluminum
block on the bottom that actually has a
cutout for some capacitors that would
otherwise interfere with it specifically
on this motherboard so these are these
are a match made to go together then
there's a copper plate on the top and
copper was chosen in this case because
soldering on copper barbed fittings was
going to be a lot easier than tapping
out threads for normal barbs so yes
we're mixing metals no that's not
recommended for the long term even if
you have an anti corrosive additive even
though that will help quite a bit but it
was more about the temporary operation
of the thing than anything else anyway
so on the inside which I unfortunately
can't show you but we should have some
footage to pop up here there are
actually fins or channels cut into the
copper now there's a lot of engineering
that goes into the optimal thickness of
the base plate compared to where the
channels start the optimal thickness of
the fins themselves and the direction of
the water flow inside we didn't do any
of that but what I want to know is how
much that actually affects the end
result so for comparison we are going to
be using an ek supremacy MX the included
water block in their predator all-in-one
liquid cooler so we'll also be using the
rest of the predator so that's a DD C
plus I believe pump as well as a dual
120 millimeter radiator and a couple
knock to a 10 ff12 fence
to get the best apples to apples
comparison that we can on our core i7
930 CPU so without further ado let's get
this party started assembling the test
bench was pretty straightforward we're
using a classic style bolt through
mounting system than just a couple of
thumb nuts over the top to hold it on
tight
the only real key thing here is don't go
too tight because you can actually crack
or at least flex your motherboard and
also make sure you're using some kind of
insulating cover on the heads of the
screws that come up through the back of
the board we're not using any clamps on
the hoses not because I wouldn't
recommend doing this in a permanent
install but just because we're only
testing very temporarily on a test bench
one thing I didn't foresee is that I'm
going to have to refill the ek predator
oops but that shouldn't be too big of a
deal because there is a fill port right
up here on the top okay hold on a second
we interrupt this compelling footage of
me installing a water block to bring you
this breaking update this just arrived
at the door and actually has some
relevance to the project we're working
on okay this my friends is our first
samples of the Linus tech tips special
edition nff 12 and nfa 14 fans from
Noctua yes my friends they are here all
black plastic and orange accents I'm
going to install them on the radiator
they'll be available for purchase soon I
don't know exactly when and we have
retailers lined up in the United States
Australia UK / Germany and Canada so
yeah going to be awesome
so got our water cooler installed we got
our block installed we got our sexy new
fans installed all that's left is to
boot this puppy up and make sure that
we're able to get into windows where we
can do our comparative temperature
testing ok so we're back with some
results that I think it's fairly safe to
say that the bottleneck was
either my copper cooling coil or I had a
bad mount last time because this is not
bad I'm sitting anywhere from 29 to 33
degrees generally speaking I take the
second hottest core when I read via real
temp so we'll call it 30 degrees idle on
the CPU not too shabby
but that doesn't really tell us anything
about its performance when the going
gets tough so we're going to start up
our i-264 stress test and find out what
happens to our CPU temps men now we have
to give it about 10 to 15 minutes to
reach equilibrium and then we'll come
back and report our load temperatures
with our custom block all right so we've
got our load temperatures as usual
they're bouncing around a fair bit but I
think it's safe to say somewhere in the
55 let's call it 56 degree territory
it's going to be our load temperature
not bad that's actually going to be
pretty pretty challenging for our
commercial block to beat by a
significant margin so let's go ahead and
change out the block and see how it does
installation of the second block was
fairly straightforward I just had to pop
off my homemade one swap the other block
onto it just using a bucket to catch
some water that spilled then I had to go
find a back plate since out of the box
this block is not compatible with LGA
1366 and from there I was able to use
the stock thumb screws and bolts and
screw into the back plate and it was
pretty much off to the races after
topping up my radiator okay so I think
we're there idle temperatures very close
but we expected that when the chips not
kicking out a ton of heat you can't
really expect there to be a massive
difference from one cooler to another
this is the case for water coolers air
coolers whatever so we're looking at
about 29 degrees on our second hottest
core for our chip now let's turn up the
heat and see how our commercial block
compares to our DIY one alright so we've
got our final results and they're
actually looking not too bad we only
managed to beat our homemade block by
about 6 degrees with a commercial block
now
with that said the gap will continue to
widen as the heat output of the
processor Rises so as you overclock the
homemade block will leg behind
significantly not to mention that it's
got a bunch of other problems as well so
overall the conclusion of my review is
this a plus four effort but it's ugly as
sin difficult to mount it's going to
corrode eventually and when you factor
in all the time that I spent building it
as much fun as that was it's just not
worth it compared to buying a commercial
block but that shouldn't surprise anyone
since the whole DIY CPU block thing has
gone pretty much completely out of
fashion over the last five to eight
years so if you thought this project was
cool maybe check out squarespace.com
it's a pretty cool website where you can
build your own website at your own URL
with your own content on it whatever
that happens to be whether it's your you
know homemade water block building
service or a portfolio for some great
photography work that you do or a
corporate website with just information
about your staff like we have at linus
media group dot-com the way it works is
you sign up for Squarespace which is
free for the first two weeks by the way
you get a free trial in there and make
sure you like it you build your website
it will look great on mobile desktop or
whatever else because all of their
templates feature responsive design and
you just kind of plop things in and move
things around in their templates they've
got 24/7 tech support via live chat and
email and you build a beautiful website
that's always working because their
plans start at only $8 a month but they
are scalable depending on what you need
to do and what kind of traffic you need
your site to be able to handle

Wars Battlefront off of it at the same
time to gamers running discrete copies
check that video out we've got it linked
