unboxing this has a completely different
naming scheme as you can see I have
already actually broken the seal once
but we had a bit of an error due to a an
errant baby that was running around our
video set so we had some difficulties
with that but we're going to open this
bad boy up and I really do mean bad boy
this is the fastest single GPU card on
the planet it comes packed in beautiful
anti-static foam with a beautiful bubble
wrap that is carefully painstakingly
labeled card four and then more bubble
wrap inside for your thousand dollars
you get the best packaging that has ever
been no I'm just kidding
so this is a reference board provided by
Nvidia rather than being one that's made
by an ad in board partners such as EVGA
or Asus which are going to be the ones
for Titan in North America so you will
get a proper retail package with a
proper warranty and all of that but this
one is just for benchmarking by yours
truly so the first thing you're probably
going to notice about the Titan is that
it is absolutely gorgeous it is styled
similarly to the geforce gtx 690 with an
extruded aluminum casing here noise
dampened fan just like the gtx 680 and a
polycarbonate window that shows you the
extended fin stack that is actually on
top of a vapor chamber cooler that
covers the GPU itself this card has six
gigs of memory now something that people
have complained about in the past
particularly with the gtx 690 is not
enough frame buffer on the high end
cards so Nvidia wanted to address this
because a 690 has four gigs of memory
which is two per GPU so two effective
because you're running an SLI the Titan
has six gigs so that means that these
four display outputs here which can be
run in three plus one so three an Nvidia
surround and one additional one as an
auxilary display can
all be powered at next-generation
resolution so this card is capable in a
3-way SLI configuration of even running
games like Crysis 3 at 57 60 by 1080
with very high details on so let's flip
the board over so there's some RAM on
this side and to fit six gigs of memory
on a board obviously you're going to
have to put some memory on the top of it
as well so I'm not going to let the baby
touch the back of the card because I'm
sure that would be a bit of a problem so
it has a 384 bit bus this is similar to
previous generation nvidia high-end
cards such as the GTX 480 and what other
technology we do we get inside so aside
from all that there are some pretty
serious improvements to the main feature
that Nvidia launched with geforce gtx
680 so codenamed kepler now this is more
like kepler on steroids because compared
to around 1500 cuda cores which is what
a 680 has the Titan has 2688 CUDA cores
so in addition to just being a Titan and
being generally beast it introduces a
new version of GPU boost so GPU boost
was what in video was calling their
automatic overclocking it was a dynamic
changing of how the card operated in
terms of its clock speeds its volt and
its voltages so according to a power
target so they set a power target for
how much power the board was allowed to
draw and video went oh okay well as long
as you're under that power target we can
ramp up the GPU clock so you'd actually
get faster performance so Nvidia started
reading their cards for a a minimum
speed as well as a sort of typical boost
clock now the problem with that is that
board power is not necessarily the only
factor there's also temperatures so
board temperatures play an important
role in the reliability of the GPU so
Nvidia won okay well let's do GPU boost
2.0 GPU boost 2.0 doesn't rely on the
actual power that the board is drawing
it relies on the temperature that the
GPU is running at so water coolers for
example would run their gtx 680 with a
water block on it so it would always be
at a very low temperature but you'd
reach the
but that that power draw limit so what
happened was the card would stop
boosting up it would stop overclocking
any further Titan will not have that
issue if you keep the temperatures low
Titan will overclock itself very
significantly so the base clock for this
guy is 836 megahertz with a typical
boost clock of 876 megahertz however
I've been told that a water-cooled Titan
without any further tweaking without any
overclocking with manual overclocking
would be expected to run anywhere from
around 950 megahertz to one gigahertz
having done nothing because it will
dynamically see that the card is not
reaching a temperature that's going to
bother it and it'll continue to add more
voltage and more clock speed to the card
until you reach that limit now another
thing about the maximum voltage for the
card NVIDIA has completely overhauled
the way that they handle voltage
increases and overclocking you can
actually go beyond Nvidia's recommended
maximum voltage for GPU reliability this
has to be enabled by the add-in board
partner but it'll give you a warning an
EVGA precision or MSI Afterburner or any
of those utilities that says look this
will affect the long-term stability of
your card are you sure you want to do
this and if you say yeah go for it it'll
let you push it harder and further than
nvidia has ever really allowed their
customers to do in the past past that
reliability point so oh yes
customizability so not only that but GPU
boost to actually enables some further
customization so you can control
everything from the fan profile to the
maximum voltage to the clock speed so
what that means is you can say look I'm
comfortable with 90 degrees I'm going to
set a target temperature of 90 degrees
and unlike a power based like a power
based target it's not approximate
anymore the fan will ramp up as soon as
it hits that 90 degree target or 80
degrees which is what it ships at or
even 70 degrees this allows the card to
say okay that's the temperature the user
wants to run it so it can dynamically
adjust the clock speed and the voltage
of the card to make sure it runs at that
temperature so what's the applique
to this well you can do a couple things
you could say okay I'm comfortable with
the GPU having less performance and I
want it to run at 70 degrees and I want
it to be silent so that means what it'll
do is it'll set your fan to spin very
very very slow until you hit 70 degrees
and then at 70 degrees instead of
ramping up the fend and compensate like
previous generation cards would have
done it will actually ramp down the
voltage and down the clock speeds to
bring it into a lower thermal output in
order to make sure that it stays silent
or you could say okay look no no I'm
comfortable with a loud card I'm going
to move my fan curve all the way down so
as soon as it hits 80 degrees it's
already running at you know 70 80
percent so that's going to give the GPU
more Headroom to crank up voltages and
crank up clock speeds because you're
giving it more fan to work with so this
is going to be pretty much the most
customizable card on the planet when it
comes to tuning the frequency you want
it to run at the voltage the GPU will
run at including setting you know
voltages for it that it can crank up to
that are higher than the reliability
would dictate and the acoustics that you
can get out of it GTX Titan is actually
faster and quieter than GTX 680 by a
longshot it's also the most complex
largest GPU ever built with 7.1 billion
transistors for context something like a
core i7 39 60 X has 2.3 billion
transistors and I think that pretty much
covers it
oh yes Lix wanting me to show a couple
of things here so it uses a PCI Express
3.0 16x interface which is as fast as it
gets these days the bottom of the card
which he hasn't seen yet is also
absolutely gorgeous on the top of the
card there's some more cool things so
there's an 8 pin and 6 pin PCI Express
connectors right there 2 SLI fingers 4
3-way or four-way SLI and check this out
the light on the top actually glows just
like the 690 and you can set it to be
either glow less or more or even adjust
the level of glowing with the GPU load
itself so you can be like okay I want it
to only blow when I'm playing games you
can set that
which I personally think is very very
cool from a modding perspective the last
thing in videos added to the driver is
the ability to overclock your monitor so
if you have a monitor that's rated for
60 Hertz uh-oh
say hi hey hi you're joining us for this
unboxing yeah if you have a monitor
that's rated for 60 Hertz sometimes that
monitor is actually capable of running
at 70 80 90 Hertz so you might have the
most powerful single GPU graphics card
on the planet and it might be able to
run your game at 120 fps but if your
monitor is only outputting 60 Hertz
you're only going to see 60 of those
frames per second so this has been kind
of a driver hack up till now Titan
unlocks it now as with any overclocking
nothing is guaranteed so there's not
no-one's promising that your 60 Hertz
monitor will run at 80 Hertz or that
your 120 Hertz monitor will run at 150
Hertz
who knows nobody knows no one knows not
a guarantee however Nvidia is giving you
the option in the driver now with Titan
to check and see if your monitor is
capable of overclocking this may affect
the long-term of your reliability for
the monitor itself and it may void your
warranty for the monitor so guys
exercise caution with any overclocking
endeavor however at least now we have
the option so it is pretty much the most
customizable gaming card on the planet
supports all those Kepler features such
as adaptive vsync and adaptive vsync
does work in conjunction with the
monitor overclocking so you might go ok
I've got I've got 90 Hertz on my monitor
now now I can set 90 fps and I can use
adaptive vsync so it's going to allow
that card to go vsync when you're at 90
fps so you don't go above and get
tearing and then it'll turn it vsync off
as you go below it so maybe you dip down
to 85 fps so yeah pretty much I think
that's it at this point don't forget to
