problems around here hey I'm talking
about the land show streaming computer
what are you implying anyway it's Friday
which means of course that today is the
perfect day to follow through on my
commitment to course there they called
me up they were like we love the land
show we think it's the greatest show the
best except that it has a few small
problems the audio sucks the video cuts
out and the system is unstable what are
you going to do about it they said look
we will sponsor you to fix the land show
so today we are rebuilding the land show
pc we are redoing the streaming setup
and it is all courtesy of our friends at
corsair the wind show now with 300% more
RGB
so the first step in any disassembly
project and my parents would do well to
remember this is to take pictures of
everything involved so you have
something to refer back to when it's
time to put it all back together though
with all the cables that straight up
weren't even connected to anything from
troubleshooting stream issues over the
last couple of years I'm not even sure
how helpful they'll be some of the old
when pcs hardware will be reused the x99
deluxe motherboard and six core 59 30 K
CPU got a dust off because they were
already added a couple of months back to
address stability performance and
resource allocation issues but pretty
much everything else is going to go
we've got 64 gigs of Corsair Vengeance
LED Ram in white and nvme SP 500 SSD a
tempered glass case with RGB lighting I
mean come at this 2017 what else was I
going to use an RM 1000 X power supply
even more RGB now with the fans Corsair
sent us extra for the a i/o water cooler
and the rear slot and some orange leads
cables to manage along with all the
other cables man cable management is
tough in an all-glass case and I don't
make matters easier for myself when I
put stuff in in the wrong order the good
news is that the finished product IMO is
totally worth the effort
this thing's looks badass next up it's
time to tear the rest of the stuff on
the desk apart for some good old
fashioned cable management there is a
lot of wasted space here and holy crap
is this table ever dirty I don't think
it's been cleaned since we moved and
neither have the multiple bins under the
desk that make up what I call the
streaming gear graveyard in here you'll
find everything that stops working for
us at some point or another
reassembly time now I'm going to put all
the wicked stuff that Focusrite hook us
up with into the retro server cabinet I
made a video about here these guys are
awesome they flew all the way out here
to not just set us up with gear but to
actually set it up with us it starts
with a solid new microphone and SC 4400
a on a road arm it's got a handful of
pick up patterns including cardioid and
super cardioid it sounds awesome
but could be improved by some acoustic
baffles in front of the table stay tuned
our sound craft mixer mainly serves as
well a mixing board so the main feature
is just lots of places to plug stuff in
this allows us to use hardware rather
than software to adjust audio levels EQ
controls and to send auxilary outputs
with a different mix our dbx 166 excess
compressor is back we actually bought
this in ages ago because theoretically
it would make it so link doesn't sound
so quiet all the time and I'm not
clipping when I'm ranting
unfortunately we derp and didn't have a
preamp for that's why it never worked
which is exactly where focus right zone
18 i-20 comes in we could use it to
accept up to 20 inputs with an optical
expander we could do our headphone
monitoring off of it instead of the
dedicated headphone amp that Focusrite
set us up with as well but we're just
concerned with the quality of the audio
capture in this case and focus writes
claim to fame is there awesome preamps
easy to overkill yes and so is the 6i6
that we're using purely as a digital
input for an additional laptop on the
table but hey come on this is line is
tech tip we're also going to use it to
monitor audio levels to ensure that no
other parts of the audio chain need to
be adjusted in the event that we change
our microphone pickup pattern placement
or even our microphones all together
so next stop is moving the computer into
place and upgrading the peripherals ok
arguably the peripherals are a bit of a
side grade but going from a full-size to
a 10 keyless keyboard gives me a lot of
extra space for laptops and stuff loving
it so far
time then for some table management this
doodad from the Manley guide to cable
management is awesome and so are the 3d
printed velcro tie anchors that Jake
whipped up on our ultime kerttu another
big improvement is that now both of our
hosts get hdmi cables for their laptops
we're running these and our camera into
new capture cards from Epis and i can't
say enough good things about these we've
actually been using them for a couple
months for the lens show as well and for
screen capture around the office and
they're responsible for some very
significant improvements in our
production values they just make it so
easy to capture at any resolution
without tinkering and did I mention
they're Canadian flippin awesome the
capture cards are USB so we needed to
add another USB card to the system to
avoid resource conflicts with three of
them attached but once we figured that
out it was smooth sailing and I really
have nothing else to say about them time
to power things up then I asked cable
mod for five power cables some
combination of orange black and carbon
they sent five each of multiple styles
of sleeving
of each color holy crap you guys anyway
at least they look great once they're in
place and I will put the giant box of
power cables that I have leftover in a
corner somewhere so time to hook back up
and power up the audio gear and take you
guys now on a grand tour of the finished
setup hallelujah silento computer is on
we are ready to tour the finished when
show set so improvement number one
make it till the land show is more
likely to be on time
these tp-link Wi-Fi smart plug things
basically we just use an app when the
phone is dead but don't worry about it
there's an app we use an app press a
button and Boop when show lighting turns
on improvement number two we won't trip
over this while we're running around
getting ready for an show improvement
number three dramatically better cable
management now instead of having the
entire desk full of the gear that we
need to run way and show it'll just be
full of the gear that we need to host
when shows so we'll have our streaming
computer our laptop we've got HDMI
cables for our laptops we've got oh yes
all of the audio gear off the table
replaced by a power distribution hub
same here which is awesome all our audio
gear is in this badass retro server
cabinet thing and our when PC is of
course heavily upgraded to be much more
reliable and much sexier all at the same
time so I guess I better get this show
on the road then shall I
so thanks for watching guys dislike or
like get subscribed check out where to
