Richmond Center and actually was just
playing some badminton so hence the
yonex shirt and I met up with the
cameraman so that I could get some stuff
from him and we figured what they maybe
we'll do a Saturday unboxing so this is
the Native Union Moshi Moshi mm oh three
I the curve it's is a wireless Bluetooth
telephone for iPhone it is designed by
David Turpin I have no idea who that is
so what I want you guys to do is leave a
comment if you know who David Turpin is
and tell me something about it because I
know nothing all right let's look at
what Native Union has to say about the
mm oh three eye it includes a handset
weighted telephone base with the
universal dock to charge your phone so
it is a charger and it is a dock it is
improved opening it is not improved call
comfort but it improves call comfort
it allows access to phone functions
while you're making calls that's good
okay the Apple universal dock charges
your iPhone while in operation fitted
with advanced Bluetooth 2.1 plus CDR
chip to allow multi point twin pairing
connects to two Bluetooth devices at the
same time that's kind of cool you got a
couple different cell phones in the
house then you can actually connect to
both of them I guess at the same time
meet noise reduction system Auto pick up
and hang up Auto connect and reconnect
super high gloss finish and a high
quality speaker and microphone so what
exactly is this thing is what you might
be asking yourself and I about boat to
answer what that is it is a bluetooth
handset for your phone made for iPhone
but the only thing about it that's
really made for iPhone is the the dock
for the charger I mean if you don't want
to use the charger it's just a Bluetooth
it's just a bluetooth handset so it's
you know nothing really
iPhone specific about it in that respect
so here I'm gonna hand the blocks to
cameraman he's gonna hand it to my wife
who's car I am sitting on right now in
order to bring you this weekend unboxing
okay
here we go so it's got one of those
universal charger guys where all you do
is you take the appropriate tip in this
case yeah we got all the different
international ones oh please tell me we
have a North America one yeah there it
is okay so you got the North America one
right there you throw that on all of a
sudden you are ready to go you've got a
couple of adapters for different
generations of iPhones to make sure that
they all fit in the charger just fine
and last but not least there is a USB
cable presumably for to power the
charger as well as to get presumably a
power the the iPhone charger actually
what the heck would that before because
it already has a wall wart okay well
let's just assume that's useful for
something and leave it at that okay so
okay yes I will get to that I will get
to that believe me I'm not I'm not gonna
pass up that opportunity okay so let's
just take it the thing is surprisingly
heavy I mean they say it's a weighted
base and I can see the value of a
weighted base because that way it's not
gonna fall very easily I mean if it does
fall it'll probably hurt your foot so be
careful so go ahead and pull that open
just got some elastic cords here tying
together the packaging okay there we go
all right that actually feels pretty
good that feels pretty slick so I'd say
the base weighs maybe about it's gotta
weigh at least a pound and a half pound
pound and a half or so okay right here
are the charging contacts contacts
contacts for the hands-free okay so here
camera man's handing me his iPhone so
that I can show you guys how it fits in
here so the iPhone when you have the
appropriate liner so it comes with two
one for iPhone for one for iPhone
previous-generation
will sit in there like that with proper
support and basically what happens is
when your phone rings when you're at
home whether you have it on the charger
or not it's just a Bluetooth Bluetooth
headset essentially with a receiver like
this it'll ring on here instead of on
here so what's the value of this that's
the question to ask yourself oh and you
okay you got volume button volume up
volume down pick up and
so that's that's pretty nice what's the
value of this well the value of it is
that lots of people don't have a
landline anymore
at my house we have two cell phones and
zero landlines so having something like
this is yes camera man degrees camera
man also doesn't have a landline so
especially with younger people this is
becoming the only bill that they really
feel like paying why pay another bill
well I have another phone line I don't
know so anyway the value of this guy is
that now you can talk in relative
comfort you don't have to have an iPhone
pushed up against your face I'm not
going to touch camera man's cuz he has
like Mac germs and stuff so it'll get
all over my face and stuff and uh but
you don't have to pay for an extra line
BAM that's that's pretty much the whole
point so this guy's wireless charges on
here I should show you guys where the
plugs are so it's just plain sleek
design actually there is the power and
there's the USB moving around to the
other side looks like that looks like
that you got little rubber pieces here
where you lay down the phone so it
doesn't get damaged in any way so
whether you have an iPhone or any other
kind of phone personally I like this I
think it's a cool idea because you don't
have to you're you're not necessarily
tied to your cell phone your cell phone
can ring in the living room and you'll
still know where your your landline
phone is so you can go pick it up so
this one is gonna actually be deployed
in camera man's house so maybe I'll do a
follow-up at some point in the future to
let you guys know it's any good thanks
for checking it out don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips oh yeah
yeah cameraman reminded me after is like
as soon as I wrapped it up he was like
yeah you forgot and I was like yes I did
okay so here are the instructions press
the mfb button 0 for 5 seconds search
for Bluetooth device on your phone and
look for Moshi Moshi zero zero zero zero
zero zero zero yes four zeros and then
you say hi which this is apparently
means hi in Japanese that's also
something I didn't
that's also something I didn't know that
the cameraman told me there's a huge
instruction booklet partially because
it's in lots of different languages okay
so if I have two cellphones paired and
connected which one will be used you can
answer calls received on either phone
you can initiate a call by using the
button to either redial the last call
use your phone's boy style feature very
cool so you can yeah like I said you can
have two phones pair to it at the same
time very neat little device and I will
hopefully be doing a follow-up in the
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
