Raider so this is actually a fairly
exciting case because it's heavy no it's
not that heavy I'm just but I'm just
messing with you guys
so this is a gaming oriented case as
most of it Phoenix's case actually are
they're a very gaming friendly company
they go for a kind of a without without
overdoing it you know like a performance
aesthetic but still very clean-looking
on a lot of their cases especially this
shinobi I love the shinobi in the
shinobi excel for the plain sleek
aesthetic that is still very for very
performance friendly so let's go ahead
and get this opened up this is the first
case that I VN encountered that supports
up to four USB 3 front ports so that's
that's something they're doing that no
one else has has actually been able to
execute on yet alright comes packed in
in a hard foam we got about an inch of
packing on either side once again you
know I'm trying not to harp on this too
much these days but I would much rather
see a soft foam but at least it's not a
huge case like the cosmos 2 or something
like that coming with a hard foam so
it's not as heavy and it's not gonna be
as full of hardware as something like
that so it's less likely to break very
nice actually very slick they just keep
getting better and better at this stuff
so let's go through the overall outside
features then we're gonna open it up so
first of all we've got four or five and
a quarter inch bays and then we've got
what appeared to be let me just see yep
so these are this whole front mesh II
intake front Ness is all filtered so you
can very easily blow the dust out of it
if you want you've got a
gorgeous-looking BitFenix logo that's
actually made of metal instead of just
being like some plastic thing or maybe
it's not made of plastic or maybe it's
not made of metal maybe it is made of
plastic but either way it feels really
good overall really sharp it's cold to
the touch so I don't know maybe it's
metal on top of plastic I'm not gonna
spend too much time spac you
about it let's move around to the other
side this side is pretty plain you got a
couple little bits here so that you can
grab on to them when you're taking the
side panel off on the other side here
very very plain as well very sleek clean
aesthetic on the top is where some of
the action starts to really happen so
here we've got an integrated fan speed
controller okay so max and min we've
also got is it focusing not now how
about we good Miku okay let's just cut
back sorry guys my lens is scratched and
I'm too cheap to buy a new camera so
there you go ah reset switch power
switch harddrive led and power led and
over here aha the coveted four front USB
3.0 ports with microphone and headphones
so this is cool I actually like top
mounted i/o I'm I don't mind
sort of front top mounted i/o as well
but one of the things that really bugs
me about almost I want to look for my
case but it's not there I've got a tech
station there one of the things that
bugs me about my case is that the front
USB is way down here which unless it's
actually up on your desk is not very
convenient although the flip side of
that is that if you were to use a Raider
on your desk you'd have a hard time
reaching the front i/o as well so this
is more intended to be used as the case
that is sitting on the floor next to you
so this looks like it comes off but it's
probably tied in some way on the inside
so let's go ahead and open it up before
we try to do that I guess we can look at
the back while we're doing this so on
the back we've got a 120 ml cooling fan
we've got seven expansion slots on a
bottom mounted power supply so that's
fairly straightforward you got your
standard i/o shield remember when they
used to include like a dummy one with
cases I could never figure out why they
did that because it's not like you know
I would always try it with my
motherboard to be like oh I wonder if it
works with my motherboard wouldn't that
be crazy if it was actually the same
layout as my motherboard this time and
it never was not once
okay so we've taken off the side panels
now which means that we can figure out
why this won't move and the reason is
aha but it comes free cable tied down
actually fairly tightly so
I don't know that we're actually gonna
undo that so let's just kind of peek
under it so you can see here we've got
support for oh what's that we might rely
on the box for this three times 120
millimeters ah the cooling in this case
is actually pretty cool give me a sec
guys
sorry guys so that's space for a 200ml
cooling fan up here in the top alright
so that's pretty much it for what's
going on down there
we're just gonna put that back on
alright so let's have a look at the
inside of the case so there's our four
or five and a quarter inch base it's got
a really nice powder coating finish on
the inside here this is actually better
than some of the ones I've seen in the
past very durable somewhat rough but
check it out it doesn't mark at all in
spite of me trying to put fingerprints
on it trying to scratch it up that is
gonna look really good in photos when
you're showing off your system and it's
gonna look really good when you're like
looking at your system even after you've
built it because it won't have all those
little marks and dings and scratches and
fingerprints all over it that is a
fantastic powder coating finished
they're using in here to 120 millimeter
specter fans in the front so yes these
are spit Phoenix Spectre fans these are
not low-quality fans and considering the
price of this case the fact that it
comes with those fans is actually pretty
darn impressive the included fan speed
controller supports up to 5 fans which
is probably about right once we flip it
over to the other side I'll be able to
know if it's exactly right and the power
for it is right here in terms of cable
routing room at the back you can see
there's plenty of room here for a 24 pin
cable as well as lots of different
options for cable routing so you've got
all your power supply cables can come
out either here or here and then they
can come back to plug into your video
cards to plug into your optical drive to
plug into your 8 pin connector or any
fans or whatever else you got in the top
can all run through here they've got a
nice wide gap there just in case you
have to run some random cable through
here they've got a gap there as well
I've had to do it so I'm glad it's there
and that pretty much covers it so let's
turn it around to the other side on the
other side of the case we've got our
tool is five and a quarter inch these
don't move until you
actually slide in the the drive itself
so yeah not gonna worry too much about
that and then we've got to list three
and a half inch so you just take your
own looks like them check this out we
happen to have a drive handy right now
so all you got to do is pop it in there
there you go you bend it out a little
bit and then you pop it in there
position these just right they are out
here they have rubber bits on them so
they're gonna be vibration dampening and
then once you actually put the drive in
it they have a lot less flex to them
they're fairly solid so you just throw
that in there and it's not going
anywhere I mean I wouldn't necessarily
ship it like that if you're gonna ship
this system I would go ahead and put a
screw in one of the provided screw
mounts right here so they do give you
the option for security or the option
for convenience moving on you've got a
ha there there they are there's our 2
USB 3 front headers right now there
aren't any motherboards I've seen that
have two front USB 3 headers but
BitFenix has also included in the
accessory box which I was having trouble
finding but have now found they do
include an adapter to allow you to take
one of those front USB 3 headers and
turn it into a front USB 2 pin up so
that will allow you to use the front
pieces as USB 2 and USB 3 so that
adapter is oh hold on a second and we
figured it out this is cool check this
out so there's the USB 2 connector which
you can you can hide the USB 3 connector
back there and then just plug the USB 2
connector in where it goes or you can
hide the USB 2 connector in the back
obviously you'd be reading this from the
back and plug the USB 3 connector in so
that's awesome so you have that option
with both of them USB 2 or USB 3 for
your front panel ports you just have to
remember which is which once you plug
them in front panel HD audio and check
it out black down to the very end power
switch reset switch power led and hard
drive LED front panel connectors very
very nice ok what else we got in here
that we're missing so there's a better
look at that 200ml cooling fan spa
up in the top there here is the third
included Specter fan okay we've got yup
seven PCI slots all with ventilation for
additional well ventilation Oh filtered
intake for your power supply so there's
your easy replace fan filter and unlike
the 800 D is probably the best example
of this where it has that bottom fan
filter that's three fan links long and
unless your case happens to be like six
feet away from the wall you can actually
pull it all the way out on like that if
Phoenix has implemented their other one
as a side mounted our side removed fan
filter so that means if you do put a fan
here just for additional airflow into
the case then you can use that to easily
pull it out and clean it not the fan the
filter that is so speaking of fan
filters you can see this is sitting
right on the floor so where would it get
airflow from they include some little
feet with sticky pads so you just stick
those there and that's going to here you
can probably see where that's coming
through right there so you stick those
there and that's gonna give your case a
little bit more elevation off of the
floor you don't have to use them if you
don't want but you do have the option
all the included screws are a little
baggy that pretty much is expected and
last but not least check this out you
can install as long a graphics card as
you could possibly want because with one
two thumb screws you can remove the top
three harddrive cages for up to three
hundred and seventy millimeters I think
437 centimeters long graphics cards and
I check that 38 ha 38 centimeter long
graphics cards so I mean her context
guys this is a 69 I'm coming back this
is a 69 90 so you can install a graphics
card up to that much longer than a 69 90
so there you have it and you can still
install three three drives in spite of
that now the overall finish of the case
is honestly really nice I never actually
showed you guys the the build in the
side panels so fairly unexceptional but
given the price of the case is not bad
at all and then they're using their
trademark soft touch feel on these
accent pieces on the front of the case
as well as on the top near the ports I
do
really like soft tattoo it's fairly
fingerprint-resistant
feels very durable and looks really good
