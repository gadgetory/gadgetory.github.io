Raider so this is actually a fairly
exciting case because it's heavy no it's
not that heavy I'm just but I'm just
messing with you guys so this is a
gaming oriented case as most of it
Phoenix's case products actually are
they're very gaming friendly company
they go for a kind of a uh well without
without overdoing it you know like a
performance aesthetic but still very
clean looking on a lot of their cases
especially the shinobi i love the
shinobi in the shinobi XL for the plane
sleek aesthetic that is still very for
very performance friendly so let's go
ahead and get this opened up this is the
first case that I've yet encountered
that supports up to four USB three front
ports so that's that's something they're
doing that no one else has has actually
been able to execute on yet alright
comes packed in in a hard foam we got
about an inch of packing on either side
once again you know I'm try not to harp
on this too much these days but I would
much rather see a soft foam but at least
it's not a huge case like the cosmos 2
or something like that coming with a
hard foam so it's not as heavy and it's
not going to be as full of hardware as
something like that so it's less likely
to break very nice actually very slick
they just keep getting better and better
at this stuff so let's go through the
overall outside features then we're
going to open it up so first of all
we've got four or five and a quarter
inch bays and then we've got uh what
appeared to be uh let me just see yep so
these are this whole front meshi intake
front pneus is all filtered so you can
very easily blow the dust out of it if
you want you've got a gorgeous looking
bitfenix logo that's actually made of
metal instead of just being like some
plastic thing or maybe it's not made of
plastic or maybe it's not made of metal
maybe it is made of plastic but either
way it feels really good overall really
sharp it's cold to the touch so I don't
know maybe it's metal on top of plastic
I'm not going to spend too much time
schedule
eating about it let's move around to the
other side this side is pretty plain you
got a couple little bits here so that
you can grab onto them when you're
taking the side panel off on the other
side here very very plain as well very
sleek clean aesthetic on the top is
where some of the action starts to
really happen so here we've got an
integrated fan speed controller okay so
max and min we've also got is it
focusing not now how about yeah we good
we cou okay let's just cut back sorry
guys my lens is scratched and I'm too
cheap to buy a new camera so there you
go reset switch power switch hard drive
LED and power LED and over here aha but
coveted for front USB 3.0 phone and
headphones so this is cool I actually
like top-mounted I oh I'm I don't mind
sort of front top mounted IL as well but
one of the things that really bugs me
about house I want to look for my case
but it's not there I've got a text
station there one of the things that
bugs me about my case is that the front
USB is way down here which unless it's
actually up on your desk is not very
convenient although the flip side of
that is that if you were to use a Raider
on your desk you'd have a hard time
reaching the front io as well so this is
more intended to be used as a case that
is sitting on the floor next to you so
this looks like it comes off but it's
probably tied in some way on the inside
so let's go ahead and open it up before
we try to do that I guess we can look at
the back while we're doing this so ah on
the back we've got a 120 ml cooling fan
we've got seven expansion slots on a
bottom mounted power supply so that's
fairly straightforward you got your
standard i/o shield remember when they
used to include like a dummy one with
cases I could never figure out why they
did that because it's not like you know
I would always try it with my
motherboard to be like oh I wonder if it
works with my motherboard wouldn't that
crazy if it was actually the same layout
as my motherboard this time and it never
was not once okay so we've taken out the
side panels now which means that we can
figure out why this won't look and the
reason is ah but it comes pre cable tied
down actually fairly tightly so
um I don't know that we're actually
gonna undo that so let's just kind of
peek under it so you can see here we've
got support for oh what's that we might
rely on the box for this three times 120
millimeters ah the cooling in this case
is actually pretty cool give me a sec
guys sorry guys so that's space for a
200 mil cooling fan up here in the top
alright so that's pretty much it for
what's going on down there we're just
going to put that back on alright so
let's have a look at the inside of the
case so there's our four or five and a
quarter inch base you've got a really
nice powder coating finish on the inside
here this is actually better than some
of the ones I've seen in the past very
durable somewhat rough but check it out
it doesn't mark at all in spite of me
trying to put fingerprints on it trying
to scratch it up that is going to look
really good in photos when you're
showing off your system and it's going
to look really good when you're like
looking at your system even after you
built it because it won't have all those
little marks and dings and scratches and
fingerprints all over it that is a
fantastic powder coating finished
they're using in here to 120 millimeter
Spectre fans in the front so yes these
are spit phoenix Spectre fans these are
not low-quality fans and considering the
price of this case the fact that it
comes with those fans is actually pretty
darn impressive the included fan speed
controller supports up to 5 fans which
is probably about right once we flip it
over to the other side I'll be able to
know if it's exactly right and the power
for it is right here in terms of cable
routing room at the back you can see
there's plenty of room here for a 24 pin
cable as well as lots of different
options for cable routing so you've got
all your power supply cables can come
out either here or here and then they
can come back to plug into your video
cards to plug into your optical drive to
plug into your 8-pin connector or any
fans or whatever else you got in the top
can all run through here they've got a
nice wide gap there just in case you
have to run some random cable through
here they've got a gap there as well
I've had to do it so I'm glad it's there
and that pretty much covers it so let's
turn it around to the other side on the
other side of the case we've got our
tool is five and a quarter inch these
don't move until you
we slide in the the drive itself so yeah
not going to worry too much about that
and then we've got two lists three and a
half inch so you just take your own
looks like them check this out we happen
to have a dr handy right now so all you
gotta do is pop it in there there you go
you bend it out a little bit and then
you pop it in their position these just
right they are out here they have rubber
bits on them so they're going to be
vibration dampening and then once you
actually put the drive in it they have a
lot less flex to them they're fairly
solid so you just throw that in there
and it's not going anywhere I mean I
wouldn't necessarily ship it like that
if you're going to ship this system I
would go ahead and put a screw in one of
the provided screw mounts right here so
they do give you the option for security
or the option for convenience moving on
we've got a ha there yeah they are
there's our two USB three front headers
right now there are any motherboards
I've seen that have two front USB 3
headers but bitfenix has also included
in the accessory box which I was having
trouble finding but have now found they
do include an adapter to allow you to
take one of those front USB 3 headers
and turn it into a front USB to pin out
so that will allow you to use the front
pieces as USB 2 and USB 3 so that
adapter is where'd it go Oh hold on a
sec and we figured it out this is cool
check this out so there's the USB 2
connector which you can you can hide the
USB 3 connector back there and then just
plug the USB 2 connector and where it
goes or you can hide the USB 2 connector
in the back obviously you'd be writing
this from the back and plug the USB 3
connector in so that's awesome so you
have that option with both of them USB 2
or USB 3 for your front panel ports you
just have to remember which is which
once you plug them in front panel HD
audio and check it out black down to the
very end power switch reset switch power
LED and hard drive led front panel
connectors very very nice okay what else
we got in here that we're missing so
there's a better look at that 200ml
cooling fan spa
up in the top there here is the third
included Specter fan okay we've got yep
seven PCI slots all with ventilation for
additional well ventilation Oh filtered
intake for your power supply so there's
your easy replace fan filter and unlike
the 800 d is probably the best example
of this where it has that bottom can
filter that's three fan lengths long and
unless your case happens to be like six
feet away from the wall you can actually
pull it all the way out unlike that
bitfenix has implemented their other one
as a side mounted or side removed fan
filter so that means if you put a fan
here just for additional airflow into
the case then you can use that to easily
pull it out and clean it not a fan the
filter that is so speaking of fan
filters you can see this is sitting
right on the floor so where would it get
our flow from they include some little
feet with sticky pads so you just stick
those there and that's going to hear you
can probably see where that's coming
through right there so you stick those
there and that's going to give your case
a little bit more elevation off of the
floor you don't have to use them if you
don't want but you do have the option
all the included screws are a little
baggy that pretty much is expected and
last but not least check this out you
can install as long a graphics card as
you could possibly want because we've
won two thumb screws you can remove the
top three hard drive cages for up to
three hundred and seventy millimeters I
think for 37 centimeters long graphics
cards and I'm just gonna double check
that and I could be wrong 38 ha 38
centimeters but long graphics cards so I
mean her context guys this is a 69 I'm
coming back this is a 6990 so you can
install a graphics card up to that much
longer than a 6990 so there you have it
and you can still install 33 drives in
spite of that now the overall finish of
the case is honestly really nice i never
actually showed you guys the build in
the side panels so fairly unexceptional
but given the price of the case it's not
bad at all and then they're using their
trademark soft touch feel on these
accent pieces on the front of the case
as well as on the top near the ports I
you really like soft tattoo it's fairly
fingerprint resistant feels very durable
and looks really good so thank you for
