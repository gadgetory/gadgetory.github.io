eventually this is the razor blade I am
doing an unboxing of this was an e3 demo
unit so yes it's already open but I
think you'll mostly get the point so
what do we have inside we have pilaf
okay interesting place silver and apply
the film to the ocal explain what this
is after so that's sort of probably
supposed to be actually inside the
package somewhere so the razor blade is
a gaming notebook from a legitimately
gaming company razor there's a lot of
gaming notebooks from and I speak from
first-hand experience from companies
that don't actually understand what
gamers want and what gamers need and not
every not every notebook solution that
is high performance or that is high
quality is necessarily great for gaming
for example Lenovo ThinkPad great
notebooks not great for gaming more
designed for corporate use rugged
portability that kind of thing so it's
all about what you actually need and
razer believes that this notebook is
entirely focused on what the gamer needs
razer as always just like brilliant
packaging that's that's how they roll it
felt like kind of a carbon-fiber ask
sort of look to the top of the box here
and that's all the time you get to look
at it because we have to keep things
rolling here and have a look at the
notebook yourself so this is a 17-inch
gaming notebook it has a quad-core 2.8
gigahertz mobile processor that turbos
up to 3.5 gigahertz did I say quad-core
I'm sorry I meant dual-core thank you
for the correction slick so it has a
dual core processor however if you
checked out my recent episode on NCIX
tech tips on the NCIX comm channel
you'll see that actually beyond the two
cores hyper threaded in modern games
there isn't really much benefit assuming
the same clock speeds however for mobile
CPUs making the same clock speed
assumption isn't really fair because
most mobile quad cores
are not clocked at the same kind of
speed as most mobile dual cores so there
you go something to be aware of you guys
it has eight gigs of DDR ddr3 memory it
has a GT 550 m graphics card and at 0.88
inches it is phenomenally thin so it
uses an aluminium construction which
feels just absolutely beautiful um wow
that's quite nice actually and the
weight is actually pretty manageable too
so the unit is about seven pounds which
for a 17-inch notebook is already pretty
good plus the fact that it uses a metal
construction which doesn't really help
with the weight factor but does help
them keep it significantly slimmer so
let's start with the overall is oh right
right right okay let's finish with specs
so spec wise right so it's got a 17.3
inch LED backlit screen it has a 256 gig
boot SSD it has let's just open this up
here it has a full anti-ghosting
keyboard so what that means is that
you're not going to have any issues or
problems if you accidentally press you
know some keyboards you if you press
sort of combination of keys you can
ghost and it can actually interject
additional characters or not register
key presses correctly all that kind of
stuff so it has a gaming grade keyboard
has a power button up here which has a
green halo it also has a fully backlit
keyboard and it's got an integrated
sound bar so instead of doing stereo
speakers they've gone with a sound bar
and this this is the kuda grass of this
particular product this is the
Switchblade interface so instead of a
traditional touchpad it is booted up now
it is a glass surface here
glass plastic feels like glass so
whatever it's it's a it's a surface here
that has two buttons and then ten fully
customizable display buttons so these
okay if you guys remember that I forget
what it called was called it was like
that art leba dev keyboard that it was
the full keyboard within the
oh LED screens and all the keys and it
was fully programmable for whatever you
wanted to do whatever language you
wanted this is basically that except
actually made commercially viable so you
use their synapse 2.0 software which
allows you to customize what shows up on
these little screens it allows you to
customize the functionality of the
buttons you can have profiles for
various games and the synapse 2.0
software actually allows you to save a
variety of different gaming settings in
the cloud so you can take them with you
wherever you go so let's finish up with
the exterior of the unit before we get
too much further into into more details
of the Switchblade just a whoops
now we break it everything ok so let's
do the the traditional iPhone thickness
comparison there you go guys that gives
you some idea so the laptop is actually
less than seven pounds the seven pound
travel weight is assuming you're
carrying around the adapter as well
which is extremely small and slim so you
can see it's even Saha here we go
iPhone size comparison whether you guys
like it or not now you know how big the
adapter is so there and this is actually
kind of cool it comes with a nice rubber
strap for dropping the cable so instead
of one of those velcro ones that will
wear out eventually because velcro
inherently will you get that instep okay
so ventilation is here on the side you
can see the the heatsink fins power in
is here Gigabit Ethernet HDMI out super
speed USB three color coded green two
USB 2.0 ports and a headphone out port
on this side on the front of the unit
you find not a whole lot in terms of i/o
and on the other side of the unit you
find just a Kensington lock which as you
can see based on that this is a demo
unit has been used can also see another
cooling vent here as well as a heat pipe
in there so obviously like pretty much
every laptop that exists right now it is
using a heat pipe for cooling more vent
oh yeah more ventilation here so this
must be the intake and that's probably
the exhaust so you're going to might
want to make sure you don't use it on a
soft surface because those are your
intakes right there make sure they don't
get covered when you are especially when
you are gaming so the Razer logo on the
back
it which i think is great and slick
apparently doesn't like the razer logo
as much as i do but whatever he's not
the one who gets to stand in front of
the camera and give his opinion anyway
so the Razer logo which I love looks
absolutely fantastic on the all-aluminum
top here and it does have a backlight so
it glows looks all baller I mean come on
it's better than Apple or Dell with
their logos on the back of a laptop see
now he's nodding in agreement awesome
the keyboard itself has almost no flex
which is of course one of the advantages
of using an aluminum construction for
the notebook the notebook itself has
this is actually pretty good considering
how thin this is so this is a very thin
screen as you guys can see now that I'm
holding my iphone up against it and it
only has just a touch of flex to it
that's really good and then the bottom
just absolutely no flex at all
completely rigid so this thing is going
to that it really helps it adds to the
durability of a notebook when the parts
aren't constantly being stressed and it
happens whether you're aware of it or
not when you're putting it in a bag or
or moving it around it will happen I
mean I mean have you guys ever used a
notebook like this and walked around
like this if you have done that you're
putting your putting stress on the
internal components because you're only
supporting a small part of it and you're
straining the PCBs it's not good for it
I mean it's not going to kill you
immediately but it's just one of those
things we're having a more solidly built
notebook is definitely a good thing um
oh yeah I will show you guys how nice
the back leg is on that keyboard awesome
so beautifully backlit keyboard you
can't really see much halo around the
outsides of the keys at all but the the
letterings themselves are very very well
lit up so those look like they must be I
mean they must be etched keys because I
kind of have any
get an awesome backlight like that right
so let's talk switchblade 2.0 so the
switchblade 2.0 UI and so you can see
guys this is a trackpad
it's also like a glass touch thing now
not everyone likes glass wait okay now
let's talk switchblade 2.0 uh synapse
2.0 before we go any further so synapse
2.0 is compatible with this as well as
future Razer products and some legacy
products like the Naga it actually
allows you to save a variety of
different things like macros any kind of
programming any kind of sensitivity
settings even things like lighting
effects you can actually save in the
cloud and then you just go to a LAN
center or go to wherever you want and
you can make sure that everything's set
up exactly the way you want if that's
cool
the Switchblade is fully compatible with
it and it can serve as a one of two
different things so it can either be a
four point multi-touch trackpad or it
can be an 800 by 480 resolution display
which is actually a phenomenal
resolution to have in such a small space
these are also LED backlit displays I
think I covered that already and ah if
you don't like the glass feel of the
touchpad it actually includes a couple
of different feeling covers that you can
put on it that'll a protect the screen
and be give you a bit of a different a
bit of a different feedback experience
depending on what you prefer so that's
that's really good Oh what else do we
have here guys oh yeah we haven't really
covered the keyboard much let's have a
look at the layout of the keyboard
because that can really make or break a
laptop for me if the keyboard has kind
of a fail layout so can I reach the
backspace yes can I reach Shift + Shift
yes I can caps lock can be off this is a
good keyboard layout yay or at least in
my opinion you know not everyone agrees
with me about everything but if they
don't then they can get their own
YouTube channels so um so the keyboard
layout uses long shifts a reasonably
long enter and a reasonably long
backspace when I see short and shift
keys short and back spaces as someone
with small hands that's a real problem
for me when the backspace ends you know
right about here and you have a really
short one because I just
can't reach it whereas this one I can so
in terms of hotkeys you've got your
volume controls you've got your external
display your media controls your
brightness as well as your other more
different brightness so your keyboard
backlight brightness as well as your
screen brightness and let's see what it
can do
there's your Razer logo for activating
your hotkeys so I don't know what
brightness that is but something's
probably going on and oh please log into
synapse to access full switchblade
functionality so give me sec guys so our
wireless network isn't working which
means I have to sit here to log in but
either way we have now logged into the
synapse 2.0 software and this is really
cool so you can customize whatever these
displays have on them so let's go to
Twitter for example oh cool and then
once you do that apparently you have
like navigation back forward and refresh
so the dynamically change in terms of
what what they're displaying since we
don't have a Twitter account set up
check that out that's actually like a
pretty ballin out display so to go back
to home you just click the razer logo
right here and so let's try going to
something that we actually can go to
like say for example um what's this oh
cool number pad okay
back oh cool
touch screen number pad I'm actually
kind of I'm kind of like in this Oh Mac
row recording okay what's that
gaming mode okay so all this is neat so
everything that's up here I was going to
show you guys the app on the screen so
everything that's here is also
apparently here so you got your lighting
effects so switch play module brightness
normal bright screen brightness all that
kind of good stuff
you've got your art that that might be
keyboard brightness I don't know
whatever something there's touch there's
a hotkeys for that anyway so put them to
sleep on this saving power saving mode
okay gaming mode allows you to do up
disable a bunch of different key combos
this is cool I actually haven't most
gaming modes are like disable Windows
key
but disabling all tab and disabling alt
f4 are sort of equally important so
yeah okay so anyway everything that's up
there seems to also be down here so
let's go ahead and press this apparently
that's gonna ha go to razor calm can we
zoom or anything like that
oh yeah I don't know how to actually
enter like a I'll search there we go
keyboard active suite I mean this is the
kind of thing that if you're someone
like me okay here here all I'm going to
show you guys something when I'm using
my computer at home a lot of the time my
smartphone is like popped up like this
on my desk because I'll have like a
YouTube video playing or something while
I'm actually trying to use my computer
this is that now I can have like triple
screens so I can be like navigating the
ncx weekly special or like reading the
forum without actually okay it's not
super fast but it is what it is forums
come on yeah there we go
no no I clicked the wrong thing ah there
we go
so I'm legs a little bit there oh I
missed I hit the new arrivals forums
come on okay so it's not quite an iPhone
touchscreen but for basic functionality
like watching YouTube videos or whatever
else this kind of thing would be
absolutely perfect so let's go back
let's see what else we got here so you
can have a clock using razors like fancy
thing and okay so this is just so you
see that Razer logo there that is
because the whole thing is a display you
can turn that off and it can just be
blank in a four point multi-touch pad
you don't have to have anything on the
display so in games you can actually
have additional information displayed
here as well which is really really
really cool so I'm going to open brace
sorry is looking for a touchpad there
I'm just sort of hardwired for that now
screen resolution so let's see if it
detects it as like a completely separate
screen yeah I don't know how they're
doing I don't know how
doing this but they're doing it it's
really cool and there you go
what's that is that the youtubes there
this is exactly like the only thing that
I would really use this for when I'm not
like other than games I guess I guess
Twitter's not bad either to be perfectly
honest so you can watch later account
most recent search so we could search
for um oops - tech tips and we could
watch my PA z77 premium motherboard
unboxing so cool okay so that is the
razor blade razor blade unboxing don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
from boxing's reviews and other computer
videos that goes my phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
