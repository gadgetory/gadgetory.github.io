laptops here on Linus tech tips and
while recent models have really tried to
up the mobile gaming ante with features
like 4k displays SLI and full-blown
desktop class GPUs like the GTX 980
pushing the performance envelope so much
means that heat management is a constant
challenge and has always been so
and many laptop coolers on the market
can be pretty hit or miss however after
we noticed the well-reviewed o polar L
Co 5 on Amazon we wanted to put it to a
test to see if this little guy could
tame the fiery demons inside a couple of
our high-end notebooks
until skull Canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more in the link of
the video description down below
most laptop cooling solutions out there
today take the form of a pad that you
sit your laptop on which cools things
down with a series of USB powered fans
on the inside the o polar L Co 5 takes a
different approach though as it's a
vaccum style CPU cooler which attaches
to the side of your laptop and sucks
additional air out giving the computer's
built-in exhaust fans a boost o polar
included a pretty solid attachment
mechanism that includes an adjustable
adhesive pad that sticks securely to the
bottom of your laptop but it is a little
bit difficult to remove due to the
adhesive being so strong and a pair of
string loaded arms that clamp the cooler
into place there's a limit to how far
these arms will go so they might not fit
a really bulky laptop there are also
three flexible shrouds to form a seal
around the laptop vent I picked grey as
the other two colors were grody
nursing-home green and old person
denture beige then lastly there's a
squishy filter to keep out dust the
cooler is clearly designed for notebooks
with side air vents as you might have
difficulty mounting it if you're only
vents are on the back of your laptop
just as heads-up the whole thing is
powered via USB and includes four rubber
feet just in case you have a thin laptop
and the cooler makes it so that you
couldn't balance it on a table otherwise
the build quality isn't too bad with an
unfortunately glossy black design with
some silver accents around it and a ball
bearing fan on the inside the cooler is
controlled by the three buttons on top
which are present for fan speed up fan
speed down and a switch this which is
between on automatic on manual and off
the auto setting uses a temperature
sensor to determine what speed to run it
at while the manual setting allows you
to pick from 1 to 13 different fan
speeds may be a bit excessive but for
those of you who really want that
granular control I guess you might
appreciate it but how does it actually
perform to answer that question we used
a pair of gaming notebooks first off was
our new EVGA SC 17 laptop featuring an
Intel Core i7
skylake mobile processor a 980m GPU yeah
this thing can put out a lot of heat
wind gaming especially on the bezel
between the top of the keyboard and the
monitor which can actually become kind
of painful to touch due to the high heat
levels so this laptop seemed to be a
great candidate for some extra cooling
we also tested our venom black book
featuring a Haswell core i7 processor
and a 970m graphics card much like the
SC 17 the black book can get pretty hot
both on the inside and to the touch so
we were curious how the O polar would
handle this smaller yet still very
powerful laptop we use our crysis 3
skybox load test to heat up our GPU and
our cpu for the SC 17 we ran the game at
4k at high settings and then for the
black book we use 1080p resolution but
cranked the settings up to very high we
decided to first run the cooler all the
way up to max just to see what it was
capable of and while it was actually
rather surprisingly awesome the results
did vary on the SC 17 temperatures on
our GPU and CPU only dropped three to
four degrees Celsius and the front bezel
was nearly the same scorching
temperature however there was a much
more noticeable difference on the
smaller black book as our bezel
temperature dropped around seven degrees
Celsius and our CPU and GPU ran nine to
ten degrees colder a very significant
improvement after switching over to
automatic mode the o polar did a nice
job with recognizing when to kick things
up a notch
but again the results varied quite a bit
between the two laptops it didn't seem
to make a dent in the SE 17 temperature
in fact the o polar results were similar
to when we just used EVGA x' fan boost
option that roughly doubled the speed of
the built-in fans even when we combined
the o polar with fan boost
we only saw a 1 degree improvement on
what we got using just you know fan
boost however the old Polar's auto mode
did cool off our black book a fair
amount about 6 degrees on the bezel and
7 degrees on the GPU and a full 10
degrees on the CPU funnily enough the o
polar did an unquestionably better job
on the black book even though the black
book CPU and GPU temperature
is with default cooling were higher than
those of the SC 17 well we can't say
with complete certainty what's
responsible for the huge difference in
our results the smaller body of the
venom black book may have meant there
was a smaller volume of hot air for it
to pull out which would benefit a lot or
that the smaller space made it easier to
apply pressure in order to pull the air
out or it's quite likely that the SC 17
may have just had a more aggressive
built in cooling solution for its higher
end GPU and the O polar couldn't really
supplement that very well so just like
any random CPU cooler for your desktop
your mileage may vary in terms of how
you're using it and what you're using it
for at 26 bucks on amazon.com the O
polar L Co 5 is probably worth trying
out if you have an average size to
smaller laptop that always seems to be a
little bit too hot for comfort
especially if you like to take your
games on the road tunnel bear is the
easy to use VPN app for mobile and
desktop it lets you tunnel to up to 20
different countries allowing you to
browse the internet and use online
websites and services as though you are
in that different country there's also
the anonymity of it they've got apps for
iOS Android PC and Mac they've also got
a Chrome extension and it's super easy
to use
you just pick your country in the app
turn the tunnel bare switch on and watch
as your bear tunnels your internet
connection to your new location when you
turn it on two things happen
your connection gets encrypted with AES
256-bit encryption and that public IP
address that website can see whenever
you access them gets switched so you
show up as though you're somewhere else
and they fixed all the annoying parts of
using a VPN for personal use there's no
dns or port configurations or bad you
just hit the switch boom it goes on and
they give you 500 megabytes of data per
month for free so you can try it out
with no credit card required then if you
want to upgrade by the way you can save
10% by going to tunnel bear comm /l tt
