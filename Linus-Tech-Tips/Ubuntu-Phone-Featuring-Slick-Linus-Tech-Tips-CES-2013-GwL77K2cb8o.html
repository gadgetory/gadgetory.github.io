thought I'd cover this because Linus
likes his iPhone way too much and we're
just here to check out a demo so if you
can show me out the phone goes sure so
this is Ubuntu phone and we'll start by
showing you our welcome screen we don't
like to call it a lock screen because we
want to welcome you to your phone and
what we've done here is this is an
infographic of things about you so this
infographic will dynamically change
throughout the day based on your social
media feeds to kind of give you a visual
representation of things about you okay
so the color the intensity of the colors
around this our golden art is going to
change depending on what social media
groups you have messages in and what not
exactly correct very cool so this is
Ubuntu this is not a port of a bun -
this is the same operating system that
runs on your desktop or in the cloud and
as you see here from the left this is
actually the unity launcher yeah okay so
let's go ahead and get into the phone
here so the first thing I'll show you is
our home screen so this is our unity
home lens and this is a dynamic lens
that will change throughout the day as
well as you do frequently used apps your
missed calls new media that you may add
to the phone etc our apps lens which is
your currently running applications your
installed apps and even apps available
for download from our app store right
and you guys will have a dedicated
button for that on release I'm assuming
exactly so let's go ahead and launch an
application okay
so launched our native photo gallery app
and what we've tried to do our design
philosophy here is you'll notice we have
no physical buttons or no hard buttons
or no soft buttons I noticed a lot of
typing actions exactly we want to be
completely gesture based right so if you
notice here the whole screen is
available for your content but if you
you swipe up from the bottom of the
screen you'll notice that we have
control buttons on demand as you
typically don't need them so right why
have them always be there that makes
sense yeah that's very cool so is there
any multitasking capabilities or
anything of the phone that you can show
exactly so we use the left edge for
launching apps the bottom edge for
controls and the right edge here would
be to actually switch between running
applications so this is the way you
would do multitasking very very cool
very cool very quick very adds a lot to
the fluidity of the phone that's very
awesome
so then how do you get back home to the
unity screen it would be one quick
gesture across the screen and that
brings you back home so those are the
three edges we have one other edge here
which is the top edge and this if I use
this allows me to get it all the
settings within the phone from anywhere
throughout the it just go along the top
yet see how it selects different things
as he swipes it across so you pull down
and then go left and right very slight
tastic awesome and you can just reply
call someone back right in line here
without ever having to leave what you're
doing on the phone so so many times you
probably been on your phone how do I
turn off Bluetooth third how do I get
back to a setting well they're all right
here for you at your fingertips at all
time right now this isn't based on
Android so what kind of phones are we
going to see this available so we're
currently talking to a ton of
manufacturers right now I can't say any
right now but later in the year you'll
you'll be seeing handsets come out
my phone is it being developed showing
on right now right so this is the Galaxy
Nexus or the Nexus 3 which is the
development phone from Google all right
very cool development here guys we're
finally seeing another big player in the
smartphone market
it's very nice speaking with you thank
you subscribe blindness tech tips for
all of our CES content have a good day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
