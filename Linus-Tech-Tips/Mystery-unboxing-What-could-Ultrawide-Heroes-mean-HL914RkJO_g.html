no I do have some idea what's inside but
all LG would tell me is that it's a
limited-edition thing for apparently
ultra wide heroes it's got my name right
on it they didn't tell me who if anyone
else would be getting one so for all I
know this will be the only place you can
find out what is in the LG mystery box
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
system that lets you get organized save
time and get paid faster click on my
face to try it now for free
alright so without further ado let's get
started shall we
this box is the most hardcore box that I
think I have ever seen and I have opened
a lot of boxes look at this thing it's
black on it even smells
I'm sure the box is not really the point
so first why don't we start on the right
hand side we've got an acrylic casing
that says ultra wide hero's Linus
Sebastian along the bottom and then a
handwritten note hello Linus tech is
more fun with you and we love the humor
you have oh thank you your videos are
inspiring people and reflecting a huge
information value to users around the
world thank you hope you like it
sincerely Diana alright so I guess this
is a Diana initiative over there she's
only been our contact for a little while
ok oh it's cracked oh that is a shame it
looks like this is a display case got
cracked
oh that's very unfortunate oh my
goodness check this out it's a 3d
printed monitor ok so that's part of it
ok there we go there we go this one says
Linus tech tips on it that is sick I'm
guessing there's three yeah three from
the from the like ultimate widescreen
triple 34 inch monitor setup we did so
that's probably what they're going for
here so here's our here's our monitor
setup all that's sick
okay this I'm not sure if I understand
it's a table oh thank you teryn it's a
table it's a desk oh my goodness
that is so adorable okay this is the
moment I haven't actually seen this yet
oh he's they suffocated him they smother
didn't they smothered him to death a
coffin this is the very first that has
ever existed
Linus Sebastian action figure they did
not get the socks and sandals that's it
nope no well I'm done I'm dying all this
awesome I'm done though I'm sending this
back to the LG I'm quitting YouTube
forever I'm done okay I'll let it slide
they did get the shirt right check that
out they've got the brofist shirt that's
one of our shirt designs they did manage
to get that I do wear jeans I do put my
hands in my pockets and I'm pretty sure
they didn't get the nose big enough but
that's okay I'll take that as flattery
as opposed to as opposed to in accuracy
so I guess what we need to do now is
figure out how it all goes together okay
he's dead he's dead
okay she just stands there that's it
right they actually got the bone
structure not too bad we missed the mono
brow but uh it was incredible how far 3d
printing is coming and how quickly ah
dropped okay probably okay see yes all
over again so there you have it guys we
don't do unboxings often anymore but
when we do I guess it might as well be
something completely unique and
one-of-a-kind just like this
speaking of worthwhile our buddies over
at masked Robb have a deal on the AKG K
5 5 3 headphones that you guys might
want to check out at draw dot slash
Linus tech tips and if you didn't
understand that URL it's also linked in
the video description but what is mass
drop you might be asking yourself too
ty would reply will you clearly don't
watch this show very often mast Rock is
a site that lets users to get together
and be like yeah we like all want to buy
that thing can we get a deal and then
mass drop goes and they go to the
distributor and the manufacturer they
get the best possible price and the more
people buy it the lower the price goes
down to a limit ofcourse you can't buy
ultra wide monitors for a penny although
they have had some deals on lg ultra
wide monitors in the past they have all
kinds of stuff from that kind of stuff
to the headphones I just mentioned too
even things like pocket knives so check
it over check it over check it out at
mass drop comm or draw up slash Linus if
you want Linus tech tips if you want us
to get any credit for it so I guess
that's pretty much it thanks for
watching guys and maybe I'll let my my
little buddy here do the outro if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome then get subscribed hit
that like button or even consider
supporting us directly by using our
affiliate code to shop at Amazon buying
a cool t-shirt like this one or with it
directly what's the contribution and now
that you're done doing all of those
things you're probably wondering what to
watch next and we've got a really cool
video series called scrapyard wars and
part 2 just came out so you should
