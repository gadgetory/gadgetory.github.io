brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital hey guys we're here at
be quiet the first thing we're going to
check out is there radiators I'm excited
for a few of these because I test the
radiators in the office and I'm sure if
you guys are excited for a few of these
because we do seem to see quite a bit of
hype around the be quiet coolers first
thing you're going to notice is that
there's no flat top classically these
have a flat top I know some of you guys
are looking for that some of you guys
aren't so if you didn't like that before
they now come with even more angles just
in case that's exactly what you wanted
and if not you can still get their older
products I'm sure not a problem one
thing with the fan is that is a six pole
pwm fan with pwm fans as i'm sure a lot
of you know they tend to tick with six
poles in them they shouldn't take as
much I'm sure we'll be able to check
that out in the office at a later date
something you might not have noticed is
that these are actually about three
millimeters shorter than they used to be
case compatibility is always a problem
with every type of cooler air or water
but with air coolers you got to get that
height down so these should be a lot
more compatible with a lot more cases we
have a variance of sizes but the other
most notable one because I'm sure a lot
of you are familiar with their dark rock
pro tues is their shadow rock slim so if
you're a fan of big tall ram like some
of those corsair sticks and a few other
brands you can get this and it should
help you a ton with Ram compatibility
and so very solid cooler as far as I can
tell the top of it looks absolutely
great if you're into that industrial
design angled kind of style moving on we
have the pier wings these aren't quite
as feature full as the silent wing set
but they're under ten dollars which is
quite insane you are getting a little
bit less in the motor Department and
you're not going to have all those nice
rubber features as we see on the silent
wings but they're coming at an insane
price point I know a lot of you guys are
looking for this style of fan because it
looks amazing and a lot of you don't
necessarily agree with Linus's whole
idea that noctua fans are absolutely
beautiful on the other side of the room
we've got power supplies and I'm sure a
lot of you guys going to be really
excited for this because of what valves
been doing lately steam machines are
really interesting and while a lot of
brands here are announcing their own
steam machines I don't really know why
you would necessarily care when you can
just build your own and you're a
computer enthusiasts like group of
people so I'm assuming you're going to
build your own so you can see here is in
SF X and T FX power supplies they both
have two year warranties the SFX power
supply come
in 300 watt and 400 watt bronze editions
and the tf-x power supply comes in a 300
watt bronze and a 300 watt gold so if
you're one of those people that is
looking to do it yourself with these
steam machines and not just by one of
the mass-produced ones this is probably
what you're going to look in for for a
very very small slim style case so
that's actually really exciting is
there's not a ton of them on market
