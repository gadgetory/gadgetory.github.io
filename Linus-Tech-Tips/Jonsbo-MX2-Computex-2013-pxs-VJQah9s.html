powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM hey guys we were just walking
around trying to check out some booths
that we might not have heard of before
and we walked by John's bow I was
interested because their cases actually
looked really really nice and you can
tell right away that there's a lot of
Elementium going on here and after
talking to the guy I realized that these
guys have om stuff Forsyth and fractal
design and are thinking of possibly om
om except for Roseville that is really
interesting as we've done videos in the
past for fractal and we've done tons of
reviews for practical so it's cool to
see who is OEM Inc some of their
products this case is really really nice
it incorporates aluminum alloy and it
incorporates steel there's a power
supply up here actually as a power cable
gets plugged in the back and then gets
passed through all the way along here
through a fairly stealthy cable then
through to the back to this power supply
which keeps the case very very small and
very very tight and good-looking there's
fan filters as he just showed me on
these fans down at the bottom which is
great because fan filters make cleaning
and maintaining your case very very easy
tons of space down on the bottom which
is great if you're going to have a home
theater system something like that where
it's very possibly going to be on the
floor and you need intakes to be able to
actually intake a lot of air some cases
that are sitting directly on the floor
the fans at the bottom are pretty much
not able to do anything you can see
there's actually a lot of room in this
fairly small case for big coolers like I
said earlier they OAM foresight
sometimes so this is a massive size
cooler beer will just hit me in the head
again I'm gonna have to get them back
for that so this is just a very very
cool case and I really wanted to show
you guys this because of how they om for
fractal if I can get b-roll
nope never mind he's turning the case
for me this is the back of the case I'm
going to turn it a little bit more as
you can see they have a nice mounting
spots for two and a half inch drives and
a fairly good amount of cable room but
this is too small of a case and there's
too many cables for me to really get the
palm test going on but there's
definitely a lot of room you won't have
any trouble with 24 pin cables as you
see right here and because of the
position of the hard drives as you can
see it's very very easy to route your
cables they don't have say to date of
cables plugged in but those will not be
a big deal because you can route them
through here and have them go up the
side just like they did they've done a
great job cable managing this and it is
a very easily cable manageable kay
we're not going to check out all their
stuff because I don't want the video to
get too long but I just really wanted to
show you guys this because it's very
very interesting right as I was about to
leave he showed me a very very cool
feature that I couldn't leave without
seeing the take off the side panel it
flips out like that on both sides that
looks so cool that's a really
interesting way of taking off side
panels and as we normally have just the
normal kind of slide back one where
sometimes you have problems fitting it
if there's too many cables or something
that slides in clips in very nicely and
it's a very cool way of putting on your
side panel so this time actually thank
