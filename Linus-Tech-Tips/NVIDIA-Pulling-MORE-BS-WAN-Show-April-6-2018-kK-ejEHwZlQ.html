PAX in Boston thank you for asking
James is here yeah hey new Luke discount
Luke disco Luke said everyone
sorry we're late you guys I have to
confess that it was not entirely my
fault James was at least partially to
blame go on
well James distracted me with his
marvelous beard I spent 25 minutes just
staring at it today rather than working
which happens to be exactly the amount
of time that I'm late
Yvonne looks confused and worried
confused but she can be a little worried
if she'd like she knows by now in all
seriousness guys we have got Oh
apparently the left ear is not getting
the right amount of attention oh crap I
I legitimately don't know how to fix
that put your headphones in mono
yep nope no I don't actually know how
that stuff works so there you go
apparently left and why do people change
these things why would anyone change
that once again we didn't touch it all
week and once again it's different
gremlins I swear there are gremlins
living in it so what's actually going on
is I have been in a mad sprint to get a
bunch of stuff done because I am going
to China I'll be gone all next week but
there will still be videos because this
week instead of being on time for one
show I was shooting two videos one's
actually pretty cool
the other ones garb yeah the one kind
the other one's kind of lame ya know one
of them Intel released an entire lineup
of called Zeon W that as far as we can
could tell as far as we could tell is
basically their core series high-end
desktop processors with a Zeon sticker
overtop of core I 9 and some ECC support
kind of ticked on in the microcode or
with a non lasered connection somewhere
in the chip or something along those
lines at least that's what we thought
and that turned out to be very true
so that that's going to be interesting
so you can see what you're paying an
extra as much as like 5 600 bucks for
depending on what kind of a currency you
use and I'm just mad that that was like
a spoiler I mean people who watch the
wind show we want to spoil them yeah
they're nice people they're good people
you too bad um second one is actually on
the little x1 carbon really nice machine
yep but like everything this year it is
not quite perfect which will drive me to
madness at some point because you got
either 1080p with touch mm-hmm or 1440p
with HDR but no touchy
is there any technical reason for that
actually I remember talking to them back
at CES and I managed to get not a
marketing person which is always awesome
when you manage to find like the
engineering guy that's kind of like kind
of like back at the back of the booth or
like kind of sipping a coffee don't let
me talk to people like yeah I'm just I'm
here but like realistically I'm not
really supposed to say anything you know
whatever so you go find that guy and
he'll be like you know yeah I wanted
that too but yeah there was there was
some issue with this and I
remember what the reason was it seemed
to be a fairly fairly good one um anyway
we actually had a great chat but you
remember a technical reason it wasn't
just there trying to hit a particular
price point there was a business reason
okay there was there was a compelling
enough reason I because I remember we
had a long chat where we were discussing
sort of the stagnation of display
technology in the PC space no one does
anything until Apple does it cuz you
think about it a PC up till the very
high end would be like 1366 by 768 you
remember that horrible sort of HD
resolution that they were pushing for a
while freaking awful and that was like
the norm until Apple came out and was
like okay no retina retinas a thing now
and then all everyone everyone raced
Torretta but it's all it all feels kind
of like like it's driven by just
responsiveness rather than trying to
trying to innovate in a way that's
meaningful to the consumer so I would
look at notebook displays and I would go
why are we trying to sell 4k why aren't
we just running a sensible resolution
like 2560 by 1440 and doing it at a
higher refresh rate that's what I'd like
to see I don't mind seeing features like
HDR for example but I don't necessarily
want to compromise on them so yeah to be
clear we are trying to we are trying to
fix the audio but for now what I would
recommend is that you use the I'm
watching a podcast but my kids are in
the next room and I need to hear if
they're crying technique I I can't do
one headphone really I can't have it I
don't know it falls out no no no it's
just the sound of it I think I'm I think
I'm like focusing on the fact that one
of my your ears is getting worn out
faster than the other I need them to be
balanced
that's insane and I'll can see it it
could be insane it just bugs me so an
okay let's say that I let's say that I
do subscribe
- yo weights too loud Anthony doesn't
just scream at him yeah yeah I'm between
a rock and a hard place no no it's final
message Jim technology let's see him
walking away so let's say that I do
subscribe to your theory that listening
to headphones is gonna wear out my ears
wouldn't I want to wear them out less
okay no it's it's not I would use just
one firm bit right right here here I'll
show you I'll show you the technique I
came up with I call it the I call it the
James is crazy but maybe just crazy
enough for it to work technique I'm
gonna listen for a little while here
mmm-hmm imma listen for a little while
here I actually miss very little of my
program but you're saving on 50% your
erosion so your erosion here's the thing
it's not hold on just a sec I hate you
so much it's not that they're getting
used or worn out like your brakes on the
car that's fine it's that they're
getting used unequally but this is all
this was just like the seed that that
resulted in me just hating the feeling
of it now right this is like when I was
like 12 or something right oh man Luke
even he knew I wouldn't check so he went
out of his way to message me and tell me
make sure that you changed the title of
the land show because I'm changing it
for things that I'm doing at PAX
Friday's 1700 can we talk about news
while you do that what you want to talk
about news you what you want the work
that you do on this show to actually
like be for something yeah that's
madness
yeah fine okay what do you there's a a
thread on our forum posted by aluminum
tech also known as aluminium tech and
this thread is about the facebook
Messenger app and how Zuckerberg the CEO
of Facebook this week confirmed that
Facebook does indeed scan your messages
whether the pictures are text or
whatever make make sure that they
conform with Community Guidelines before
actually sending it to the to the
recipient so if you send something
that's against their guidelines like
hate speech or inciting genocide or
something like that they may not
actually deliver that message to whoever
you're talking to which I definitely
have some benefits but the thread on our
forum kind of erroneously implies that
the that were not just talking about
Facebook messengers normal messaging
when we're talking about this this
surveillance it implies that we're
talking about Facebook's secret function
which is more akin to apps like signal
or telegram and that's actually not the
case Facebook does have a function
Facebook Messenger has a function where
you can make your your chats encrypted
end-to-end and that the interface turns
black and there's a little lock and you
can even make exploding messages like
snapchat style Facebook is not scanning
those messages at all or maybe they are
and we have no evidence of it but the
the news or whatever Zuckerberg confirm
has nothing to do with the secret
messages it has to do with the normal
messages and so we really shouldn't be
surprised that they're looking at those
so tell me then okay do you use facebook
Messenger
yeah actually it's one of my primary
messaging apps okay how do you feel
about them scanning your messages with
an automated system for community
guidelines standards adherence
as opposed to like a human well I guess
I'm asking two questions first so um do
you like or dislike it I believe okay
first of all I think we should clarify I
believe that they're scanned with an
audit automated system and once they're
flagged it requires a human to then say
this message is not getting sent through
I believe that's how it works
sure I am fine with my messages being
scanned okay and are you surprised by
this no no I should also mention that
they do not use the data that they any
of the information that they scan that
information is not used to sell ads
which is what Gmail used to do prior to
last year right so I gotta tell you I so
okay okay story time so the only reason
that I use Facebook is that Facebook
does not permit you to manage a Facebook
page so the first page that I had to
manage and the reason that I had to
create a Facebook account was the one
for NCIX PC back when I worked there so
we were trying to get into this whole
newfangled social media thing and so I
needed an account so that the page could
invite me to manage it and make posts on
it and stuff I have probably posted of
my own volition a grand total of I don't
know between five and ten things on
Facebook ever I only use facebook
Messenger as sort of a as a digital
phone book because the the good thing
about Facebook is that whether you know
whether you're happy about it or whether
you kind of just do it because you have
to pretty much everyone has it and and
yes thank you
whoever's in the twitch chat declaring
that they do not have facebook because
they're taking some stand good for you
we're all jealous we all want to be in
your shoes yeah but but but the truth of
the matter is that Facebook is a great
way to get in touch with people and
aside from people changing their names
like yeah okay like having your first
name and middle name as your facebook
name no no I mean I mean people getting
married okay so there's a this is kind
of embarrassing but I was going through
my friends on Facebook and I was like
who are these people
shut up the people I was confused about
were mostly women from my high school
class that are now married and I was
like that kind of looks all oh okay that
that makes sense and then like a kid
that I went to elementary school with he
changed his name from like his his
stepdads name which was his last name
for some reason I'm not quite sure how
that worked to his birth father's name
huh so I was like oh your whatever your
name is berry now that's cool wouldn't
have known that if I had from berry
berry not being e to be a that would be
tough but anyway so what's good about
Facebook is that it's it's a digital
phone book it's a real phone books
aren't a thing anymore but the bad thing
about it and the thing that has always
made me both a little bit uncomfortable
and just feel like it's a little bit
unnecessary is that while I am
technically a millennial I share sort of
updates about my life as a job I have
never done it for leisure not once when
I created a Facebook account it was
because I needed to for work when I
created a Twitter account it was because
I had to for work and when I created a
YouTube account it was because I had to
for work same with twitch for that
matter so I just straight up like don't
really get it and I've never really felt
it's never been because I feel super
comfortable with it that I've shared a
lot of detail about my life on like some
of you have probably noticed that I now
that especially now that the Linus tech
Twitter account is managed by the entire
team I post almost nothing really
personal on it and I only post to my
personal account like once every couple
weeks at most and I've had a lot of
people ask me like why don't you do more
of it
- cat tips channel or why don't you vlog
or why don't you do this so do that and
the truth of the matter is like I
actually I like not having to talk to
anybody
yeah no kidding alright like it's
related I have found that I watch
started watching our videos a lot less
once I worked here for a while and it's
like not a surprise like what do you
want to do when you go home do you want
to watch Linus tech tips like no you
just did Linus tech tips all day I I
just had to look at him for the last
eight hours
the last thing I want to do is to see
him again because he's annoying oh it's
not you see how I'm not see I'm only
wearing out when you're right now it's
not you it's me
it's weird today someone someone made a
thread about you know an item that they
thought would be awesome for us to
review though I send it to Anthony who's
like oh I have you seen this yet he's
like yeah Alex just made a video about
that today like it's done already so so
okay so back to back to messenger so for
me honestly it doesn't affect me much
because even though I do have a Facebook
account this is it actually okay yeah
I'm gonna hum go off on another thing
here haha
use your words if I had a if I had a
dollar for every time we've run a
giveaway or a promotion or something and
it has required you to tweet something
for every time someone's been like yeah
well you got you guys suck because I
don't have Twitter if I had a dollar for
every time I saw that I would still be
mad because it's phenomenally stupid
Twitter is free Facebook is free and the
only information they have is what you
give them
creating a Twitter account that's sole
purpose is to enter giveaways really
doesn't give them a lot on you and get
this it's free you could create a new
one every time hey but you need to have
an email address which is freedom also
free so if you don't if you don't want
it that bad too
created free anonymous email and a free
anonymous Twitter account
people are like cookies once post
the thing log back out it's pet peeve
show next pet peeve topic with that so
so I do so anyway so I do a Facebook
account but they actually probably know
very very little about me personally
other than that I'm a tech head and I
post a lot of techie stuff for work so I
guess I'm trying to say that I just have
not bothered that much you know it sucks
more of a Facebook message er than that
feature is them putting ads in your
inbox you probably haven't even seen
this but on on mobile like you'll open
your messages it'll be like your partner
your best friend your acquaintance
oculus blah blah blah with a picture and
everything really and then another
acquaintance straight up like right in
there and I don't know if these are in
whatsapp yet but I wouldn't be surprised
if that happens soon since they've been
want to monetize whatsapp for a while
and they own it um I would like to show
you something super super cool and funny
I think there's a way to see your page
as though you are like oh man it's no
you might not your personal page have
you as a page visitor no no alignment
line is tech tips one right oh wow is it
gone oh that's pretty annoying
well anyway up until sometime hopefully
fairly recently the the Linus tech tips
page actually had as like like the top
post like somewhere near the top please
don't send messages to this account
nobody checks them and right now see I
don't even know where to find them which
is super terrible see the feed do you
know where you find messages maybe you
disable that maybe that's why that
warning isn't even there anymore I don't
know we had something horrendous like I
don't remember how many tens of
thousands of messages that people sent
and I was just like
I don't know I don't know what I can do
for you to help make it more clear that
you shouldn't send messages through here
and it just said something like yeah you
need to go on the you need to go on the
Twitter page if you want to or the
Twitter account if you need to send a
message and I Wow I just I have no I
should I should honestly I should be
screen sharing right now because you
guys would find this pretty funny I have
no idea how to use Facebook how do I
Facebook you maybe you used to then as
soon as you had a kid it just left you
know how your old people I just never
did I just actually never cared like at
all yeah I don't know but anyway so the
point is I do use messenger but it's
usually just to be like oh yeah that
person that I met at like badminton at
the rec center a couple weeks ago what
was their name again alright maybe I'll
see if I can get in touch with them yep
one the facebook messenger feature I
like is that you can make you your
default SMS app on Android anyway so you
could type in someone's name and then
choose to message them via Facebook or
through like regular texting which is
weak is then you only have one app for
both purposes but it also kind of sucks
so I eventually switched back to not
doing that alright so why don't we jump
into the next thing that I'm super mad
about the original article here is from
a non tech and this was posted by
aluminium Tech on the forum once again
alright this is really dumb and really
frustrating and it's not the first time
that this has been done by either AMD or
Nvidia and so right to be clear even
though it's Nvidia doing it this time
AMD has done it in the past neither of
them is getting a free pass here and
this behavior is absolutely 100%
unacceptable it's right in the headline
Nvidia quietly rolls out slower lower
TDP GeForce GT 10:30 with ddr4 VRAM
now to be clear the GT 1030 is not some
kind of pillar of gaming cards or
anything like that and you wouldn't
expect to be running the latest games at
the highest settings at the highest
resolutions with them but you would
expect that if you bought GT 1030 that
what you got out of the box would be
similar to someone else's GT 1030 and I
would make the argument that if you look
a little bit closer at these specs here
look at this memory that is running at
one third of the speed huh oh man
not to mention at lower base and boost
clocks with a completely different
memory technology so we're talking ddr4
versus gddr5 I would make the assumption
that that is not what you would expect
and that that is going to make some
difference to the gaming experience and
that if you are buying a dedicated
graphics card you probably care at least
somewhat about the gaming experience is
it true that these systems the systems
that will be running these low-end cards
discrete as they maybe won't actually be
able to really reap the benefits of
gddr5 anyway
so it's not a huge loss okay so you
could make the argument that the way
that a review site like us or a non-tech
or whoever else would typically
benchmark a card like this is not
necessarily a very real world because
what we'll do and we've taken a lot of
flack for this over the years presumably
from people who don't understand why we
do it this way but what we'll typically
do is we'll take the highest end
processor in them on the market and
we'll throw a GT 1030 on it and then
we'll report our results with the GT
1030 compared to some other graphics
cards you know whatever suite of cards
we decide to test and the the fatal flaw
that people feel like they're pointing
out for us is that
no one would install a GT 10:30 on a
$2,000 79-80 XC 18 car extreme edition
but the problem is that if we use
anything else we lose track of the
difference between these graphics cards
because what might happen is the higher
end ones might end up bottlenecked
so it doesn't give you a clear idea of
the value per dollar prospect of each
car you're trying to remove the cpu as a
variable altogether yes so it's as fast
as possible hmm
now with that said it is possible that
in the kind of system someone might
install one of these in you might not
see as much of a difference but I think
you would probably see a difference
especially because GPU memory has an
impact on the GPUs ability to load in
textures for example so it might affect
the detail level that you can run at now
this is a complete this might be
completely naive and ignorant but does
the type of memory impact the TDP of the
graphics card so it depends it depends
on the clock speed it's running at it
depends on the I think it's yeah it
depends how many chips you're running it
depends on yeah mainly that depends on
the yeah it depends on the tech that's
being used so you could also make an
argument that it's better to have a
lower TDP GPU like if you're looking to
get a 1030 and the kind of system that's
going to run it you might actually want
that lower TDP more than you want the
extra memory so that is possible but in
that case what I'd like to see is a
separate SKU I ended up arguing with
sapphire on the phone about how was I
supposed to be about 16 years ago but
I'm still mad I ended up arguing with
sapphire on the phone and AMD for that
matter about a Radeon 9600 that I bought
so that should give you guys some idea
well I've told you how long ago it was
anyway the point is it was a Radeon 9600
and it came with a 64 bit I still
remember to this day came with a 64-bit
memory bus instead of a 128-bit bus and
back then
that was a big deal and compared to a
1030 a 960 was still sort of a somewhat
respectable card like if he wanted to
play I don't remember if this is sort of
era appropriate but I think like Sims
would have been the kind of thing that
my sister might have wanted to run on it
that would have made a significant
difference and the reason I was mad was
that not only was it not marked clearly
anywhere on the box what the difference
in spec was between this card and the
other one the only place anywhere that I
could find this information was on
sapphires website but not their North
American one it was on their Europe ow
Wow so I had to go all the way out of my
own territory online in order to find
out that this card was not the same
thing and it was like hidden like way
down somewhere and this was at a time
when manufacturers were often doing like
se editions of cards special edition or
a second edition but with the community
nickname these things was slow edition
because a lot of the time they were cut
down because of yields also like they
had a bunch of scrap chips that they had
to do something with so they'd like you
know cut down the memory bus so they do
do something else like that and that's a
point that people are bringing up this
this time you know what's the difference
between this and the 1080 TI it's just
but the thing is they don't put the
these other letters these qualifiers
front and center on the box in this case
this is way down the line in the product
description it's a is a description of
the memory it's not up front right
beside the ten thirty
yeah they do put d4 in the description
but it's not a 1030 d4 it's way way way
way down there so I find it really
frustrating but Nvidia seems to be
rather than having taken our feedback
and a lot of other members of the press
feedback to heart about the 1063 gig
which is more than just a ten sixty with
three gigs of RAM or I should say less
it's actually slower as well they seem
to have taken all the feedback that we
gave them
and crumpled it up and thrown it in a
fire because here they are doing it
again and it's only been a few months so
what I worry about is that if we don't
call them out on this it's gonna be
something that we're gonna continue to
see happen and that's not what we need
you don't want to have to walk it like
remember guys this is the same company
that brought you green light that
brought you a program that restricted
their partner's abilities to pre
overclock their cards to differentiate
them supposedly to reduce confusion like
that's why they have all these branding
initiatives and stuff like that ooo not
to mention g4s partner program we want
to reduce confusion do you want to
reduce confusion or do you just want the
right type of Chondroitin so it's good
for their business interests so it
doesn't matter a lot of people won't
notice anyway I won't know so just let
it kind of slip by ah this is great
Sparky Sparkle man 55 says rip I got the
notification a half hour late no no we
were just a half hour late unless you
just got it now yeah we're the ones
ripped so I guess I don't really have a
ton more to add I mean this this is
really frustrated and you've got you've
got a note in here some of the list of
documentation does show with two
different core names GP 108 300 versus
GP 108 310 but the whole thing is very
confusing and the old this oh this was
what I ended up yelling at AMD about 16
years ago
AMD on their website because remember
this was not an AMD card technically it
was a sapphire card as if AMD didn't
send them the friggin chips AMD zone
website had no mention whatsoever of a
64-bit memory bus variant of this card
so in this case once again just washing
their hands of it
the official nvidia geforce GT 1030
product page mentions nothing about this
change so how can you how can you how
can you advocate for less consumer
confusion when you're running around
enabling your partners to release
products even if you technically not
your product or whatever the defense
would be how can you be running around
enabling partners to create products
based on your products that you don't
even list on your website especially
going forward when those partners are
part of the GeForce Partner Program ah
very very frustrating all right
do you also feel passionately about this
Spectre business um I can't imagine that
you feel as passionate about it what I
really feel passionate about is eating
savage jerky I knew in my head I was
like he wouldn't he couldn't god damn it
you did savage jerky is a tasty snack
that's not bad for you it's made with
the best ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives and their goal was to
create a snack that's full of flavor and
not bad for you which I think I already
said I got my talking points mixed up
here they've got 13 different flavors of
jerky some of the Dan favorites are the
sriracha bacon my personal favorite is
the maple buffalo bacon I gave it to
someone else to try like two weeks ago
and they were like yeah but whatever I
like it I don't care what more for you
then
more for me probably John you're not
Canadian not that I wasn't understand
maple not that I was going to share it
with anybody in choice so whatever these
cracked pepper and sea salt is really
good the traditional is really good the
anything Moho is really good give me how
you beg you're a vegetarian I want to
check with the label and stuff oh and
why not show off a different flavor fine
little box so they not only make jerky
they've got hot sauces barbecue sauces a
spice rub Jack you're not supposed to
get any well this bag fine take it this
bag has been open for over a week so you
don't get to complain when I take care
Eminem's anymore yeah but you don't get
to complain when I picked the M&amp;amp;Ms out
of your trail mix I think he's pretty
generous I he's giving me M&amp;amp;Ms without
me even asking before so he's off her
coat ltte to save 10% on savage jerky
products
next up you got honey so when you shop
online are you the kind of person who
suddenly turns into a tab hoarder yeah
it turns into sure um
loading dozens and dozens of new tabs
middle-click really is like the bomb
what is that you middle click to open in
a new tab
you mean like click the mouse wheel yeah
doesn't that just make it like the
continuous scrolling thing no what no
when you click a link
oh you middle chrono link yeah you don't
know this no it's the best that's how I
end up with like a hundred times I
really like that you know what I use a
lot control shift T you know what that
is
are you reopened close tab oh no I just
never close them that's far better so
anyway one of the reasons you might end
up with a bunch of tabs is searching for
promo codes hopefully at least one that
actually works and you don't want to
close any of them because you might have
to go back and you know try them again
or try them on a different product or
whatever the case may be well honey gets
rid of all that honey is the free
browser add-on that over 9 million
people are using every day to save money
will they stop online in two clicks you
can add honey to any browser for free
then shop like you normally do honey
scans and tests millions of coupons in
the background then at checkout
honey automatically applies the best
coupon so 9 million I felt like a sucker
Time magazine calls honey basically free
money what am i doing so there's
basically no reason to not add honey to
your browser it's free to clicks to
install and will save you money so try
it out over at honeycomb / Linus and
we're gonna have that linked in the
video description finally fresh books

think you just owned the ears of the
viewers thank you for that I don't have
a choice
alright what topic do you want to do
next oh oh can we do this one okay I'm
sorry okay but the thing is only part of
this is news
all right fine we'll do your stupid ps5
thing no this is good I don't want to
talk about this no I'm already I'm
already screen-sharing the original
article here from expressed co dot uk'
ps5 rumors are it might come out this
Christmas a lot of people think those
rumors are dumb so this started on a
website called what is it called the
situation or I'm gonna have to stop
calling you ladies is that my accurate
we're gonna have to go with we're gonna
have to go with savage James
here have some savage jerky that was
savage okay so I actually this this
website has a great name in this context
semi accurate com behind a $1,000 per
year pay wall or a hundred dollars a
year for students this website published
an article with allegedly legit
information claiming that the
playstation 5 was gonna come out this
holiday season which is a lot Sumer then
people would think considering that the
ps4 Pro came out only two years ago and
the ps4 itself only came out five years
ago and when traditionally the launch
cycles of these things have been about
seven years between the three and four
so people think that you can we so nee
can make a lot more money off the ps4
Pro still the like that can become the
de-facto like normal default PlayStation
for people and they can start to push
the price down to like 250 bucks
they don't need to release the new
PlayStation just yet yes for pro was two
years ago
yeah bro see the older you get the
faster time goes because each year of
your life is a smaller proportion of
your life no it was a year and a half
okay oh okay I should have written the
months in oh okay
no no but by the time this launched in
the Christmas it would be to you oh I
see your point
okay okay okay so here's okay you want
to go through the rumoured specs first
sure it's gonna be AMD again the
platform like the architecture is Navi
it's gonna be eight cores and I actually
have a question about that if we get to
it yeah it's gonna have a strong
emphasis on VR support that some
discussion there you know they have to
make certain considerations and
decisions to include that and maybe no
one cares but maybe no one cares this is
no good VR yet and this is a chicken and
egg thing they did recently drop the
price of the psvr
but i don't know what my understanding
is that the psvr is the best selling
gaming VR headset but i also don't know
if that's meeting sony's expectations in
terms of how many they have to sell in
order to support it it's a I think at
this point it's a rising tide lifts all
boats thing with VR it's a set up for
future profits what else do we know what
this thing we know that the CPU would be
rumored to be Zen based although we
could pretty much take for granted that
any future custom SOC that AMD would
produce for whether it's Microsoft or
Sony would hopefully be Zen based at
this point so here's my question and
again noob question maybe on the PC in
the realm of PC gaming prior to Rison
and coffee like for sure single threaded
all the games and engines and all that
and api's are optimized for single
threaded right so depends MOA we
strongly it strongly depends so some of
them basically since we started getting
dual cores which was actually Oh a
really long time ago and how
just sort of terrible at least ten years
more than that yeah you're in laptops
ten years UQ 6600 I remember buying our
work queue 6600 engineering sample which
technically you're neither supposed to
buy nor sell from my old boss at NCI X
back in 2007 so yes quad-core and that
was a like 600 $700 CPU so that was like
the first non Extreme Edition
quad-core but certainly not mainstream
yet then this just walked by with an
eggplant so we've got so we've had quad
cores on the desktop for 10 years and
that chip later dropped in price I think
probably about eight months to eight to
twelve months later and became far more
accessible so ever since then we have
seen an onward march towards supporting
more course now in the early days the
support was fairly rudimentary like you
would have one core dedicated to like
mostly the entire game and then you'd
have another one that handled like maybe
enemy AI like like like one thing you
know can be offloaded but over time they
got to supporting more and more and more
threads natively and I believe Crysis 3
supports something like borer well why
is it then when Rison came out and it
had all these course everyone was stoked
on it and in theory the performance
should beat a lot of these Intel SKUs it
didn't and it was because we had to wait
for the game developers to optimize
their games and the API is for
multi-core okay so there were a couple
of things that happened first of all a
lot of the things that people were
excited about with Rison and about
multi-core on Rison well actually I
think it's mainly two things one is that
AMD depending on how you look at it and
it's complicated but AMD wasn't that far
behind Intel for gaming in a from a
certain point of view as obi-wan might
put it because at the
solutions that you would be likely to
run games at so higher resolution with
higher details you'd be more likely to
hit a GPU bottleneck than a CPU one so
in that sense AMD CPUs weren't that far
off unless you did want to turn down
your details to get higher frame rates
because you were a competitive player or
unless you were you cared about your
power consumption because they did
consume a lot more power before Zen or
if you wanted more up-to-date features
on the platform because by the end of it
and like those boards were looking
pretty dated in terms of their feature
sets so there were there were lots of
other things
let me fully actually yeah finish the
question the final Clause of the
question is given that in the PC side
it's so weird that in the console side
you've got these multi core AMD chips
like ruling the roost on like all the
consoles mm-hmm so our game developers
taking different approaches on console
and PC so ok so back to your question
the things people were excited about AMD
having better single-threaded
performance for gaming and AMD having
multi-threaded performance for other
workloads and also to put pressure on
Intel because that's what Intel did
right they launched quad core on the
desktop back in like 2006 and it was
quad core on the desktop up until 2000
and in 1:6 that was pretty much it
unless you wanted to sprawl there were
six there are six core AMD CPUs like to
I mean on the intel citing about those
six core AMD processors those that they
didn't threaten Intel even with six
course they weren't competitive with
Intel's own quad cores that they could
turn on so didn't so it wasn't really
relevant they sucked more power they
didn't overclock there was there was a
bunch of things so people were excited
because Zen would bring more competition
to the market now getting back to AMD's
previous course not necessarily being
that underpowered for gaming well that's
what you're seeing on the game consoles
so because the game developers know
exactly what hardware they're optimizing
for they can go okay
we're gonna have exactly this oh right
the other issue with Xen performance on
the desktop in games was actually more
software and firmware related there were
scheduler issues with Windows and there
were I mean any new CPU it's kind of
like why I put what was the Mo's the not
scented the 6950 X's in the editing
machines like three weeks before the new
18 core flagship came out the reason is
that anytime you have a new CPU launch
whether it's AMD or Intel and
particularly on this last round where
both AMT and Intel we're guilty of
pulling up their launches just to like
just to have something out there and
then being not quite 100% polished
anytime you have a new CPU you're gonna
have some some issues and that was a big
part of what affected gaming performance
on the desktop and sometimes game
developers did have to optimize because
even though it's x86 it's it's not like
a new CPU is just the old CPU but like
with a trogdor like arm like it's
actually different and so if you gave
even if let's say you gave a
professional driver and I don't I don't
know cars but so you'll have to forgive
me but let's say you gave them Bugatti
and a Lamborghini of some model X&amp;amp;Y and
you were like okay
get the best track time on this track it
would take them a little while if they
switched from this one to that one to
learn the best way to do it even if this
one was more powerful like it did they
are their div they're different machines
so coming back to consoles has been a
very sort of winding topic here they
know exactly what they're optimizing for
they don't have to make any guesses and
they are going to run the game in such a
way and they're gonna optimize the game
in such a way that you aren't going to
run out of cpu resources also by the end
of AMD's non Zen course while the
performance wasn't great their power
efficiency was getting a lot better so
they take this good power efficiency and
they've got four kind of like good
enough course and they've got developers
who know that they can split it up
exactly in this way because it's gonna
run
for course there's not gonna be some
Yahoo out there running a dual core
because Intel still has dual cores for
some reason and they can and they can
split it up that way to make the best
possible use of the quad core and then
the GPU well they can push the game's
visual effects to the max so that they
can run into a GPU bottleneck rather
than a CPU one also it's a console it's
gonna run on a TV it doesn't have to run
higher than 60 FPS anyway cool I get it
there's the long the very very long
answer hopefully that will ease finish
your bacon you've been so good walking
with your hands way too much to still be
holding that bacon so please and now to
circle all the way back to the beginning
in your opinion mmm-hmm is the PS 5
coming out in 2018 even if it's December
31st okay consider that when the ps4 I
think was a pro came out which it was is
either the pro or the ps4 I came out in
November and we knew about it a February
of that year if this is gonna come out
in the hall at April yeah yeah we're 2
months beyond that this now it probably
would be launching in November if it's
there trying to make the holiday yeah so
that's a short media window to get the
hype running so do you think it's coming
out this so normally I would say
absolutely not and the reason is that up
until now every playstation whether it
was emotion or whether it was cell or
whether it was a move to Jaguar every
PlayStation has been architectural II
dramatically different totally different
so if you told me in April there's a
PlayStation coming in November I tell
you to go take a long walk off a short
pier because you're an idiot because
there's no way that in what does that
work out to seven months there's no way
that in seven months anyone is gonna
have launch titles ready because they're
gonna have to completely like recode
aspects of these games in order to run
on this new machine the developer things
are already out there ok that that is
known ok so that we know but even then
like I'm saying there's still no way
that seven months would be even close
like a modern triple-a game remember you
launched a console without a Monsieur
Nintendo at least a couple triple-a tier
games and those take literally years to
develop and it's not gonna be it's not
gonna be good enough to just take some
existing titles and go now at you know
4k with better details or whatever else
if they're people were really into that
they'd go buy a PC however because a
PlayStation 5 would be just PlayStation
4 on steroids with Zen course which is
going to be a big difference that's
gonna be like really nice and then
presumably and it says Navi based
graphics which would be again very nice
remember this is not Vega this is a new
architecture past Vega because it would
be just like that on steroids new
architectures but much more powerful
ones but still fundamentally x86 and
crap what does aim do you call your
thing again so you're saying it's Lucien
it's kind of like des ucn anymore anyway
the point you're saying it's kind of
like ps4 pro pro yeah like but way more
Pro because yes provide on crossfire
which was a bad approach I think
actually your theory we might have some
credence given that one of the other
leaked bullet points here is that the PS
5 would be backwards compatible with ps4
pro titles why not yeah it might as well
be right because it's fundamentally
pretty similar in terms of the hardware
and so you've got PE you go you go this
site sent me accurate you haven't heard
of it apparently but I've been following
Charlie I don't remember how to
pronounce de marriageand image emerge
again whatever Charlie I've been
following Charlie since about 2002 back
when he used to work at the Inquirer not
the National Enquirer The Enquirer and
back then being choir was the bomb for
industry leaks they do have a track
record of being prescient and accurately
leaking
specifically console related leaks in
the past now I've been wrong a couple
times with something I can suggest why
that might be C okay and I makes me a
little uncomfortable because I've never
really talked to Charlie much so I don't
want to like talk about him when I don't
actually know him that well but what I
can say is that I do know that I've
never seen him at an industry event that
isn't an AMD one okay so what I can
extrapolate from that particular data
point is that if AMD talks to him and no
one else does and he gets industry
information somehow okay that maybe he's
getting his information from that's
pretty interesting contacts at AMD and
if he would be if he has a track record
of leaking console news which AMD has
their hardware in up until the switch
had their hardware in all three that
would align with my guesses as to where
his sources ma be from so that to me
adds some credibility because over the
years
Charlie has taken a lot of flack for
saying a lot of stuff that didn't turn
out to be true but as a reader of his
over the years who you know takes rumors
with the grain of salt
okay the thousand dollars a year no okay
no I eyes didn't I read before I read
before he put up the pay well so but as
someone who's kind of paid attention to
his career he's been right enough that
if you read with the grain of salt that
you should take rumors with in the first
place and then he called the site semi
accurate I mean what more do you want
um he's offered a lot of insight
overnight that's what that's what I'll
say so all right
I'm not saying yeah there's gonna be a
ps5 but I would suggest that this might
be why Sony hasn't had a response to the
Xbox 1x yet and this might have been a
good move
them to let microsoft launch the 1x few
months ago and then say okay you know
what we're gonna miss out on having the
crown for like a year but realistically
Microsoft can't run out and release a
new Xbox again so we're giving up this
year now of console you know thrown them
but we should have a year or maybe more
than that afterward while Microsoft
responds yeah they want to wait until
the ps4 pro sales have peaked and are
starting to taper off but also enough
time so people from some people who
bought a ps4 Pro will also buy a PS 5 at
launch and it's not everyone is gonna do
that another major factor is that
they're there at AMD's mercy here they
can't release a faster console until AMD
releases a faster freaking piece of
hardware so Pat custom SOC design
process takes time and you can't start
that process until the individual
components of it so both the CPU and GPU
are at least somewhat finalized so this
looks like mean that timeline sounds not
that you know what the more we talk
about this I'm going with it
PS 5 this q4 it's on put your balls on
the table there you go bet something so
the bet would be either it's coming out
holiday season or it's being announced
at e3 next June mmm Orcas this June yeah
I don't know I'm gonna say I'm gonna say
it's coming holiday season I don't know
exactly how they're gonna handle the
hype leading up to the release but you
know what I'm in when are they gonna
announce it they can't wait to leave 3
at June that's good they could yeah that
gives them like a people do they need to
announce it at a conference or an event
or can they just launch it more and more
companies Manion ounce it Microsoft did
this for the Xbox one more and more
companies are just doing an apple style
like conference they're just doing you
know what forget it we're not gonna
announce things at CES or Computex or e3
or whatever we'll do our blow into our
own party but they do it Apple does it
up their own conference every year
exactly what does Sony have one of those
um I don't know if Sony has done that
but more
our companies are trying to do this so
yeah let's find out maybe they maybe
they'll just do their own thing I'm
seeing CES you never know WC speaking of
things you never know you never know
when big brother is watching the
original article years from CNET sorry
for the abrupt change in topics but I
really want to cover this and it's like
20 after 6 already and I really want to
talk about this I am going to Shenzhen
on Monday so an AI company that works
with Shenzhen Police is creating a
system that will use CCTV cameras to
identify jaywalkers and send them a fine
via a messaging app ok so full
disclosure here that's seen in articles
from July 2017 because this is the fact
that peoples are getting in trouble like
their faces are being projected onto a
giant billboard in real time because
these facial recognition equipped
cameras are watching them jaywalk that's
old news that that's been since last
summer the new update now is that if
that happens to you you might just get
an SMS that's like here's your fine bud
click through and pay it could be SMS
could be in a we chat which is I guess
gets compared to Chinese whatsapp so
over 10 months ending in February this
year these boards that they created
displayed thirteen thousand nine hundred
and thirty jaywalker faces so I got like
a public shaming thing yeah well
apparently jaywalking is a bigger deal
in China than it is over here I don't
see that there's more people they have a
different attitude
both the pedestrians have a different
attitude to the law according to Chinese
political party opinion anyway and
drivers have a different standpoint to
pedestrian right-of-way apparently I saw
there's studies where in Germany you
might only wait 60 seconds to cross the
road but in China it might be 90 seconds
and that's longer than people we need to
wait and even when it's their turn the
drivers might still just drop like not
respect their right of way anyway so
there's a lot of jaywalking and
presumably because of the number of
people there there's it causes a lot of
traffic and
bottlenecks so there's a high incentive
for for the government to try to work
this out so one of the ways they'll de
incentivize people to jaywalk is by
socially shaming them putting their face
and their family name by the way up on a
giant billboard that you can see and now
I guess they're attaching a monetary
incentive or D incentive on that as well
I mean this is just so apparently only
about 10% of the population can be
identified by this city or by the system
in the city of Shenzhen but if you
consider that they're already working
with third parties like these chat
applications to deliver fines presumably
they could work with third parties like
crap what's there what's there Amazon
Alibaba like they could work with
Alibaba
well no Aliexpress is is partners like
yeah but Alibaba is like to contact
manufacturers not always buy so they
could work with wait hold on a second
well where's he going Alibaba Group
Chinese multinational you come yeah no
Alibaba Group not like alibaba.com
necessarily okay anyway so the point is
that they could work with companies like
that that have or they could work with
Chinese phone manufacturers for example
that I'm not gonna say who or what
they're doing now but have been known in
the past to put you know back doors on
phones and or share information with the
Chinese government so they could work
with these groups to make the facial
recognition just one part of how they
identify you so they could monitor where
you go what you buy who you spend your
time with and they could use all of
these things to augment their facial
recognition technology so that they
could actually make a very very good
guess as to who you are even if they
don't get a perfect look at your face
and where you are they can track you
while you're driving your car
exactly apparently 600 million CCTV
cameras in China it's like it's getting
too full on surveillance tape and some
of these things are positive like
there's there's benefits from it
you can go to certain airports in China
and be and not have a boarding pass it's
all facial recognition your hands are
full of your bags you just walk by the
flight the attendant as you go onto the
plane like that's pretty sweet
Wow maybe you'll get to do that if
you're in an airport that has that you
should make a video there's no way out
way to do it cuz yeah oh yeah that
doesn't any sensor in fact the reason
why only 10 percent of the population of
Shenzhen gets their faces recognized is
because presumably it's like the
database of all the different provinces
is and integrated so if you live in
Shenzhen but you're from a different
province then they just don't have your
record available so that's why they
think that the number of people who will
be susceptible to this tech should go up
dramatically once they do get a more
broadly based system in the future
alright last topic for the day because
we are not gonna stop harping on this at
least until you guys get bored of it
more GeForce Partner Program News a sous
to our res that just me or does that
sound like kind of like a Spanish I'm
actually trying to figure out if it's
supposed to be like Ares well Ares used
to be had areas before with an S on the
end what they called their rog AMD based
cards so it was at the at the very high
end they had Mars on the Nvidia so maybe
that's intentional because they're not
allowed to say ROG anymore they're still
saying Strix so maybe people will
remember that Ares was ROG and because
losing ROG hurts man like people
consumers know what our our G is and
they want to buy it which is still
bizarre to me because I still remember
Jim being just like baffled and angered
by the original integral in Plantation
of that branding it's just like this is
so stupid
what is republic of gamers even mean
what is this like a a place where all
the gamers live you never been it smells
weird but it's pretty dope there that's
what we need is a new sponsor like a
deodorant product People's Republic
because the sales pitch writes itself
it's like too busy gaming to shower just
use this spray no problem
at least for a little while eventually
you'll have a problem so rich dicks asus
rog streck's turns into Aries or areas
Strix are a soos duel tunes into RS duel
a seas expedition which I've never even
heard of before turns into RS expedition
it's way out there so not only do we
appear to be losing our og branding it
looks like they aren't even putting a
sous branding on the cards bat bat
weirds me out a little bit
isn't that a maybe like at what point is
somebody gonna leak this freakin
agreement so that we can have a look at
it because I'll tell you usually 99% of
the time when like you know some
controversial document gets leaked or
whatever I'll like read a bunch of
articles kind of figure out what the
consensus is and go okay yeah or I might
I might read a couple of paragraphs of
the thing if the geforce partner program
leaked i would read the whole thing like
multiple times i I want I want to
understand I don't just want to see
what's in there I want to understand
what's in there cuz this sounds like a
scary friggin document well in the
original what's the site that leaked it
hard OCP right now in that original blog
post or article he wondered if it was
actually legal I don't know man me too
so thanks for watching guys see you
again next week same bat-time same
bat-channel so much bacon maybe
different co-hosts
time mortal co-hosts what I meant were
you looking at the dates of tax no no no
we're gonna bring a straw pull this
we're gonna drop along this James got
good job alright let's go let's get some
options in here yes no donkey balls then
I got a login info donkey balls create
this pull here come on you guys you
gotta let us know do you do you really
want
new co-hosts next week I guess I ignored
the possibility that the new co-host
being replaced would be me because I'm
traveling next week so oh yeah some
people have said that Luke James is
their favorite combo well it was my mom
she's biased Oh terrible hey more donkey
balls Munoz come on donkey balls let's
get it let's get our act together here
that's a win I want to see some more a
donkey ball that's what the poster on
your office door is about donkey balls
inside well I'm gonna need the whole
donkey for that wait Linus likes donkey
balls
James donkey and we'll see you again
next week
good show most people said good job
cool fifty-one percent so it's like a
very narrow most that was good show yeah
felt smooth well no we're still alive
right that's good
felt smooth buttery savage jerky smooth
smooth like honey sure yeah that's
number four
