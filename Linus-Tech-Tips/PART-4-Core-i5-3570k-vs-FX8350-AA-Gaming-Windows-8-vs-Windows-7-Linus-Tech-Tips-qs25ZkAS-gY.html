gaming showdown I'm gonna start with our
platforms we've got across our five
formula with an FX 8350 at 4.6 gigahertz
this overclock should be attainable by
pretty much anyone running this chip on
an overclocking ready platform but there
is some headroom to keep going however
we have an equally conservative
overclock on our 35 70 K running on a
Maximus 5 formula this guy is running at
4.2 gigahertz now they're both running
muskan black line memory there's
Copperhead heat spreaders on here but
there's nothing special about those it's
just regular 1600 megahertz memory and
we're running a 188 gig SSD for our boot
drive in the X 854 hour power supply and
an H 104 hour cooler now I specifically
called out that you needed an
overclocking ready platform this is
something I wanted to bring up because
the cost of the platform the cost
difference between these platforms is
not surely dictated by the cost of the
chip itself so the FX 8350 is about $20
cheaper on average than a 35 70 K
however these two boards after you
actually have a $50 price difference and
if you look at what the minimum bare
minimum z77 board costs it's around 120
dollars whereas you can get a 970 a
board as long as you're not planning to
run a high-end dual GPU setup that you
need so even then it supports 8 X 8 X 4
a crossfire operation you can get one of
those for around 80 bucks so that's
something to consider when you look at
the performance numbers we're going to
show you methodology wise we're using
our usual approach so our standard card
is an msi geforce gtx 660ti power
Edition this guy right here we run it at
a standard overclock that we always run
this card on you can check out all of
our GPU overclocks on any of our video
card reviews we are using fraps to
record average frame rates however we
are aware of the new methodology of
measuring frame times however there's
also been I mean it's been an explosive
time in GPU benchmarking and the correct
tools for measuring frame times actually
don't yet exist except with some very
specialized equipment so we're doing
pretty much eye
one else is doing and we're still using
fraps to measure frame rates but expect
that to change sometime over the next
little while as more tools become
available we do use in game runs so you
guys are gonna see little messages pop
up if you want to see exactly how we
benchmark each game just go ahead and
click that check it out and then you can
run your game the same way that we do
and find out how your system stacks up
so you're gonna see four scenarios on
each graph Windows 7 with Intel Windows
7 with AMD Windows 8 with until Windows
8 with AMD we're running anti-aliasing
on all of the games this time around we
have a separate video where we ran with
no anti-aliasing and we're gonna start
with Far Cry 3 so in Far Cry 3 the only
real change that happened was when we
went from windows 7 to Windows 8 both
platforms improved in performance
particularly the Intel one went from 15
frames per second minimum to 24 frames
per second minimum delivering a much
smoother experience while the AMD
platform was at 20-plus frames per
second minimum on both Windows 7 and
Windows 8 so it looks like Windows 8
comes ahead but the actual results in
terms of the average frames per second
was about the same on both cards giving
you about the same gaming experience
regardless of which chip you choose
Crysis 3 is pretty much nothing to
report here guys so B FX 8350 and the 35
70k perform about the same and the
performance doesn't really change from
windows 7 to Windows 8 in battlefield 3
we saw a bit of a different story with
both of them recording about the same
average framerate so a little bit higher
with the 8350 edging out the 35 7 you
can actually I shouldn't say edging yell
it's about you know 5 percent
performance difference however it should
be noted but because we're using real
runs the margin of error for our tests
is a little bit higher although we do
run them multiple times to get them as
accurate as possible however both
platforms increased in minimum frame
rates from 35 to 40 3 on the 8350 and
from 37 to 51 when moving from windows 7
to Windows 8 so there was there was less
less of a dip when you run into an
intensive scenario on Windows 8 versus
Windows 7 in Skyrim there wasn't really
much to report the 35 70k gets a clear
win here versus the 83 50 and
performance didn't change going from
windows 7 to Windows 8 it should be
noted that our Skyrim benchmark is run
with about 8
in custom mods enabled and we haven't
released our Skyrim benchmarking guide
yet but that will hopefully be coming
sometime soon in dirt 3 this was one of
the more dramatic changes without
anti-aliasing both chips were running at
an average around 150 frames per second
enabling anti-aliasing on this title had
them both tanked to around half of what
we were seeing previously it should also
be noted that they didn't really change
in performance from windows 7 to Windows
8 once again witcher 2 we saw
performance improvements going from
windows 7 to Windows 8 in terms of the
minimum frame rates so on the AMD
platform we went from 52 to 57 and on
the Intel platform we went from 51 to 64
so witcher 2 ran better on intel
particularly on well not on Windows 7
but on Windows 8 it ran better on Intel
but not on Windows 7 so that was a very
interesting observation it also took the
averages and put about a 10% difference
in performance between the two chips
whereas on Windows 7 they were a much
much closer pretty much within margin of
error in Metro 2033 we saw a performance
improvement for the 8350 of about 10%
and we saw average frame rates for the
Intel stay pretty much the same they
actually dropped a little bit but again
margin of error anything you know a few
percentage points we should pretty much
not read too much into Crysis 2 we
didn't really see any optimizations go
on from windows 7 to Windows 8 so that
pretty much leaves us with Intel being
the clear winner for Crysis 2 if you
still play that game which I suspect
most people do not but we like to
include it just because of the oh who
can it run Crysis so there you go guys
Windows 8 on the surface looks like the
optimal gaming platform whether you go
AMD or Intel and I mean quite frankly
it's up to the individual viewer whether
you watch a video like this and go this
performance difference is worth this
number of dollars to me we're not gonna
make that decision for you we're gonna
let you go do that but it looks like
Windows 8 is the optimal gaming platform
however there were some issues that we
encountered running our games on Windows
8 such as the requirement to install
games for Windows Live before actually
installing any games otherwise it causes
all kinds of hullabaloo and games just
not launching and things like that and
some other random glitchy behavior it
should be noted though that with some
googling we did get all of the games
working so if you want that extra little
bit of performance that's me
then it might be the way to go thanks
