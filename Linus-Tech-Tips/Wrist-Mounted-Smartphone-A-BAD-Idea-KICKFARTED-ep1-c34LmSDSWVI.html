new series that we're going to be doing
based on crowd funded projects through
Kickstarter IndieGoGo or whatever other
platform that ship but don't exactly hit
the mark episode one will be about the
Neptune pine the Neptune pine is a fully
featured smartphone that goes on your
wrist yeah
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check out the link in
the video description to learn more the
Neptune pine Kickstarter was legendary
made waves as a Canadian product were
Canadians here at Linus Media Group and
it was in the local news and stuff this
thing made over $800,000 on Kickstarter
in the relatively early days and in
Canada that's a big deal our population
is less than the state of California so
having a new company that does something
like this is cool and a lot of people
were excited and so were the backers
because they were making big claims
they're saying that smartwatches
at the time were just notification
engines and fitness trackers they were
saying that they weren't living up to
the hype they were saying that they
wanted a fully fledged standalone device
on your wrist and that was awesome
and I was so hyped and it was sweet
there you can saying that you're gonna
have full app support for everything you
wanted you're gonna be able have video
chats with a front-facing camera and you
can take high resolution to HD videos
that pictures the back facing camera
awesome
so naturally we bought one we backed the
kickstarter in november of 2013 with the
intention of getting a unit linus
specifically wanted to review it like we
do here on Linus tech tips but a problem
which is not unique to this particular
Kickstarter it didn't exactly show up
and naturally when working on many other
things we forgot about it then we got an
email about the Neptune duo a new fancy
SmartWatch from Neptune with enhanced
features and all this new fun stuff
slight problem we didn't have the
Neptune pine yet Linus emailed them
maybe were eight teeth asked them what
was up what's going on guys they
responded shipping notification coming
soon sorry for the inconvenience and you
must not have seen the Kickstarter
updates interesting wouldn't be too
surprised as Linus you gets tons of
emails he might not have seen it I
believed this full heartedly at the
beginning but then he showed me his
inbox and he didn't receive any
correspondence from them between July of
2014 and March of 2015
Linus responds within two minutes saying
guys I don't want it anymore please
cancel my shipments please give me a
refund etc at this point he doesn't
really want the device
it's been too long no point doing a real
full formal review he's over it they
don't respond for a long time he sends a
bunch of emails in the interim finally
he's like hey guys I kind of can flex my
muscles on social media and make this a
lot worse for everybody they respond
saying yeah we informed our Kickstarter
backers there's no more refunds signing
off
team Neptune Neptune pine calm is now
dead it sparked by some random website
it's been replaced by get Neptune calm
but when you google Neptune pine having
the first result be a park website is
kind of odd and the original repository
is just kind of gone the Kickstarter
page isn't better it hasn't received an
update since August there was shipping
notifications apparently from May 2nd of
2014 to February 11th of 2015 that's a
pretty big shipping window and
apparently it wasn't even that
successful because you go to the comment
section it's just unfortunate there's
still an ocean of people that haven't
received their shipments at least we got
ours eventually so deliverability wise
not great so far but Linus did decide to
eventually do a review on it and even
carried it around in his bag for about a
month but just decided there was more
important things to do and eventually
shelve that anyways we have now decided
that it would be a perfect candidate for
kick farted episode 1 so I guess now
it's time to check it out it's
uncomfortable made with very stiff
materials and things like the band that
are very not forgiving as a lot of
plastic construction it's very large and
unwieldy I don't want to wear it all day
there's certain large watches that are
very wearable all day this thing is not
in my opinion the viewing angles of the
screen are crap Brandon took this nice
photo of me but if you tilt it to the
side you can see that it starts looking
really bad and speaking of the nice
photo the color depth murders it the
lighting is very smooth on the real
photo it doesn't look very smooth on
this screen now we talked about the
camera earlier on if we switch Instagram
to camera mode you'll see another
problem that's how that looks that's how
my phone makes it look which one
you choose I'm gonna go with the phone
basically every time but I guess let me
know in the comments down below you
might have noticed too that I was
running Instagram on here you can't even
do that off the start why because you
don't have the Google Play Store
Neptune ninja calm has a great guide on
how to route this thing and then get the
Play Store installed it's really easy to
follow it's a great guide very good
write-up good job Neptune ninja but
let's admit that shouldn't have to exist
and just because it's good doesn't mean
it should ok ok crappy rhyme aside let's
address the direct claims they said that
it had a high resolution rear-facing
camera okay let's benchmark it there's a
cool looking bomb over there that I
built a computer in not that long ago
you can check out that video up here
let's see how it did with that photo
maybe we should retire the term high
resolution I guess they're not
technically incorrect here but come on
guys that looks like crap and I don't
want to post that anywhere let alone
Instagram which is what I just took the
photo with and it's almost dead
it's a 14% battery doesn't even make it
through a workday they also claimed that
it's the only SmartWatch that can video
chat and while that's true they probably
shouldn't want it to be true you saw how
bad the camera was earlier they also
said that it's compatible with tons of
apps and yeah as we discussed earlier if
you root the phone and force Google Play
onto it you can download a bunch of apps
and they will work but the usability
isn't there and usability is extremely
important check out Instagram if you
look at Instagram you kind of have to
scroll through a single photo to see the
entire photo which is not ideal you
should be able to see at least one full
photo on your screen at a time I don't
think that's too much to ask
and last but definitely not least on
this list of points is that this is a
standalone device and while that is true
it is unfortunately true it's
unfortunate that they tried this
shouldn't be a standalone device it has
a SIM card slot that's great for theory
but I took the SIM card out of my
cellphone this is not a point I'm trying
to make please note I know you can get
like a five dollar adder on your
cellphone plans for most carriers to add
a SIM card and share your plan across so
it's not a big deal but that meant that
while I was using both of these devices
I found it actually considerably easier
better and more convenient to bind
somehow a free Wi-Fi hotspot jump
through all the hoops to connect to it
and then do what I was trying to do on
my phone instead of on this thing
because doing it on this thing was
legitimately worse there was then other
problems like battery life filming this
right now I charged this thing like five
hours ago you can see the battery in the
top corner is in red not that long ago
during this filming it gave me the
warning that it was below 14 percent
battery life this is not an all-day
device I didn't even use it that hard
today I am a power user but I wasn't on
it for that long so while it can be a
standalone device I wouldn't want it to
be so what's next for Neptune what's
their future that would be the Neptune
duo and the Neptune hub the duo of which
we mentioned earlier the inspiration
behind the Neptune duo and Neptune hub
was the idea that sometimes you know you
might just want a bigger screen which
makes sense considering they probably
use the pine for any amount of time at
all the way that they're going to do
this is by having a screen with a
battery behind it that's it in the form
factor of a cell phone and a tablet the
idea would be that your storage and your
central compute would be on your wrist
as your watch and these devices would
just be essentially battery banks for
your watch considering this thing died
so fast that would probably be helpful
and would allow you to have a bigger
screen for bigger applications they
would even have an HDMI dongle which
would be able to do this to something
like a TV or a monitor so that you could
control everything on your watch on a
bigger screen an improvement
that's very cool in theory Linus and I
have talked about this even on the LAN
show way in the past with nothing to do
with the Neptune pine what we were
talking about was just a central
computing like disk or puck that you
might carry around in your pocket which
do the compute and storage for all of
your other devices an interesting
concept and I think wired summed it up
pretty well about the Neptune hub they
said a glimpse of what computing should
be in 2025 and I can see that and that's
an interesting idea but for 20-25 it's
currently 2016 that's a ways away and
I'm into emerging technologies as much
as pretty much anyone I know and this
isn't for me it's so unusable and
unwieldly that I don't want it and that
is unfortunately a consistent problem
their videos look awesome the hype is
huge but consistently the comments on
their backers pages are depressing we
know this guy's a little dated but also
thought that it still might be
applicable considering some people are
still awaiting their shipments and
people are dealing with the aftershocks
of their second crowdfunding campaign
