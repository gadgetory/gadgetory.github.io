material is the stuff that goes between
a heat generating component and the
cooler whose job it is to remove the
aforementioned heat from the
aforementioned component now today's
video will cover how to replace the
factory applied thermal compound on your
graphics card with an aftermarket one to
reduce the operating temperature of this
sensitive electronic component
potentially improving its lifespan and
in some cases even its performance
thanks to GPU boost technology or
another way to leverage it would be to
have it actually run quieter making the
fans not spin as fast but then have it
run at the same temperature if that's
your thing which if it is by the way
stay tuned because our review of the CM
silencio 650 2's is coming very soon
cooler masters casemod World Series is
your opportunity to show off your
modding skills and win great prizes
entries close February 7th 2015 click
now to learn more now our test today
focuses on a particular model of
graphics carnac geforce gtx 960 super
super clock that was graciously provided
by EVGA but this principle applies to
lots of different types of electronic
dude adder II in a desktop computer the
CPU motherboard or really any type of
expansion card might have a cooler with
a with lame-duck thermal goop on it and
on a laptop the same can also be true
one thing to be really careful of though
is warranty coverage some manufacturers
don't want you poking and prodding at
their product or they will invalidate
your warranty fortunately EVGA is cool
with that as long as you return the card
to at least as far as outward
appearances go the factory configuration
before sending it in front RMA they'll
even let you replace the cooler outright
with something else if you want to but
we won't be doing that because a EVGA
ACX 2.0 plus cooler with its dual double
ball bearing 92 millimeter fan design
quad heat pipes and fanless operating
mode is already pretty darn good and be
because that would introduce an
additional variable that would make it
impossible for us to know if our goop
replacement made a difference so we're
just going to take it off and
put it right back on again when we're
done after we overclock it after all if
you're not going to push your hardware
to the limits mods like this are
certainly a fun thing to do on a
Saturday afternoon but not exactly
necessary so the settings I dialed in
were a hundred and ten percent power
target plus 0.25 millivolts on the GPU
and plus 144 megahertz to boost with the
thin speed locked at 17% or around 580
rpm and all of this was in a room with
an ambient temperature of about 21
degrees Celsius this yielded
temperatures of 67 degrees using EVGA OC
scanning utility 1 million particle
plasma stress test running at 2560 by
1440 resolution in windowed mode the
boost clock I observed with these
settings was 1586 megahertz
although it should be noted these
settings were not verified in actual
games and these stress test programs
often allow higher clock speeds than you
can achieve in the real world anyway
let's get to business
first gather all the materials you'll
need the card itself isopropyl alcohol
and a lint free wipe a screwdriver and
replacement thermal compound I'll be
using icy diamond because it's among the
best on the market start with the four
screws positioned around the processor
itself usually near the middle of the
card and tensioned by Springs loosen
them in a cross pattern then remove them
fully for our card this was actually
enough to completely free the cooler but
on some other cards you may need to
remove the rest of the screws on the
back and even others on the top bottom
sides or even rear i/o you can test if
you've got everything by giving the
cooler a wiggle then once you're sure
all the screws are removed you can
gently pull it free never force it and
be mindful of your fan power plug you
don't want to accidentally yank on it
since those connectors are often very
fragile now you can see from this
footage I took when I did my initial
swap that EVGA is using like a a
pre-done exactly square thermal paste
patch rather than relying on manual
application and that it seems to be
working for them the baseplate of the
cooler is making very even contact with
the GPU core through only a thin layer
of material this is very desirable you
need thermal compound on your GPU or
it'll overheat but a thick layer
can actually insulate the GPU causing it
to run hotter
speaking of which some graphics cards
will have what are called thermal pads
they're a little bit thicker on
components like voltage regulator
modules or memory chips leave these on
and reuse those pads unless you have
replacement pads of the exact same
thickness replacing pads with a thick
application of paste can cause poor
contact between your cooler and your
graphics card with the cooler off it's
time to clean both the GPU itself and
the base of the cooler with 99%
isopropyl alcohol 70% is fine too by the
way I recommend starting with a couple
slow high pressure passes on the cooler
base with your cleaning cloth to remove
the bulk of the goop from the surface
then fold that away and find a fresh
part of your cloth and use a buffing
motion to take off the rest do the same
for the GPU itself just as an FYI the
compound on there won't damage your card
if it gets on the chip package or even
on the board PCB but that's not a
license to be sloppy try to remove as
much as you can with the compound
removed I usually do a final pass with a
fresh cloth to remove any lint or
residue apply thermal compound isn't
rocket science and remember less is more
you want enough for it to spread out and
cover the whole GPU but not so much that
it gets mushed out on the sides and gets
all over the place I use the line method
but a dot in the center also works just
don't waste your time spreading it out
it's messy unnecessary and can actually
trap air bubbles in the compound in some
cases although normally those would be
squeezed out by the same pressure that
spreads the thermal compound with the
other techniques once you tighten the
mounting screws on that note now it's
time to tighten the mounting screws
again in a cross pattern throw this baby
on the test bench and find out if it
worked boom low temperatures using the
exact same testing parameters of 64
degrees about a free degree improvement
Wow gallery so it's not exactly
earth-shaking so if you're sitting there
wondering what exactly was the point of
doing all this to a brand new piece of
hardware that's obviously working just
fine I don't blame you but I was ready
for that question so here are some other
situations where it might make more
while EVGA didn't do this some
manufacturers use really low performance
thermal material either to save a buck
or for reasons that are unlikely to ever
even occur to most consumers things like
stability over time or at extreme
temperatures during storage so there's
that and even the most well intentioned
manufacturer who chooses the highest
quality thermal compound can have a
sloppy application once in a while so if
your component is running hotter than
you're expecting or not turbo in as high
as you'd like you can follow this guide
to try a thermal compound replacement
since it doesn't cost very much and
finally this might actually come in
handy if you're trying to breathe new
life into an older piece of hardware to
thermal pastes particularly the lower
quality ones don't stay potent forever
and may need to be refreshed every once
in a while speaking of things to refresh
once in a while your monitor and mass
drop is currently giving you the
opportunity to refresh to one of the
sexiest monitors on the market for a
limited time they have the LG 34 UC 87
be the sort of very near cousin of the
current love of my monitor life LG's 34
UC 97 for about 350 bucks off of its
retail price at their lowest drop at
this point you should probably be
familiar with mass drop because of their
awesome deals on great tech products
like this one but if not I guess I'll
give you a little rundown they're a site
that facilitates group buys ensuring
that you can get great deals on
basically everything you need in your
day to day life like tools clothes tea
entertainment items like this LG curved
display and even board games and stuff
like that items are selected by the mass
drop community through polls and the
most popular items are sourced by mass
drop they work directly with
manufacturers and distributors to find a
starting price a lowest price and a
bunch of prices in between and the more
people agree to buy the more the price
goes down it's awesome so there's a
referral link in the video description
that leads to the drop for this awesome
monitor Lee 34 40 by 1440 resolution IPS
display it's curved it's freaking
awesome the only real difference between
it and the 97 is that it has a height
adjustable stand which is like even
better so you can head down to that
to get full details on pricing and the
duration of the drop if you're
interested in a curve display but have
been scared off by the price so this
might be a great opportunity to take
care of that anyway speaking of great
opportunities to take care of things
