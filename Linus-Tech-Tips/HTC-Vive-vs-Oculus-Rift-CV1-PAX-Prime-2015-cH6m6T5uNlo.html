pax prime 2015 this year check out the
cloud to gaming headset in the video
description down below also thank you to
a sous and corsair welcome to no actual
booth in particular what we're checking
out right now is the oculus cv1 or
consumer version 1 and the valve HTC
vive combo thing what I came to pax
prime 2015 expecting to do was have a
head-to-head between these guys in terms
of tech specs but that doesn't seem to
be the really important thing here which
is a little abnormal for me I'm used to
be like whoa times this resolution
screen and this refresh rate on the
screen all its gonna stuff that's great
they're both kind of getting to a point
where it's it's okay it's obviously not
great it's not the ideal VR experience
people still want higher resolution
people still want higher refresh rate
because then it will feel more immersive
and look more realistic you can still
kind of see the graphics aren't that
amazing because framerate is super
important in VR so you need kind of
lower settings and higher framerate a
really beastly machine we know all this
kind of stuff so okay what is it coming
down to well as you guys know killer
apps is super important oculus right now
has a Valkyrie gear VR has something
from Eve as well and valve HTC vive has
a whole bunch of their own killer apps
coming up it's going to be kind of that
whole console pc gaming war thing all
over again even though they're both on
pc because it's going to be okay well
this one is hooked into this one
specifically and yeah that's kind of a
problem to be completely honest i'm
hoping that they merge libraries because
then people are going to be able to get
the experience from the hardware that
they want and be able to play whatever
game they want I don't know how true
that's going to be in the end we've seen
it time and time again people are like
oh yeah we're going to get rid of
exclusives and then they super don't so
I don't know we'll have to see now
hardware experiences there is some stuff
I can stay here the main differences are
about the sensor the oculus has a sensor
that sits in front of you and looks at
its ir leds and that's actually pretty
good but only kind of condenses you into
either a sitting experience or a
standing experience in a fairly small
square you can still stand and move
around a little bit but really not that
much the vibe gives you much more
freedom
around in a much larger area and have it
still be relatively accurate because
their sensors that will go up on the
walls in kind of the corners of the room
and track you there the problem with
this is it's less consistent and harder
to set up harder to set up the first
demo I did for the vibe was that Nvidia
on the first day really early on and
none of the demos that I tried worked
every single demo I tried had a critical
failure at some point in time during the
demo also the HTC truck that was outside
the convention in a parking lot had so
many problems that they had to shut down
part way through the day I know their
booths that I tried to that a sous they
had it going on but I tried them much
later on so they were able to kind of
fix some of the bugs it's an interesting
idea a lot of you guys out there are
going to be tea growers and you're going
to be able to work on this stuff and set
this stuff up and that's cool you'll
have no problem but other people are
going to want the more simple experience
I don't know if I can condense these two
brands into simple experience and more
complicated experience yet they're not
out yet we'll have to see but it's kind
of how it's looking for now I'm excited
hopefully you guys are 20 FC in 2016 how
this war ends or some might argue begins
anyways thanks to hyperx for sending us
