are streaming yeah that's not gonna make
any sense to them if they don't follow
me on Twitter but if they don't follow
me on Twitter they don't deserve to get
the references then they don't make any
sense no that's someone else yeah
conference what people that I got it oh
no that was Nick he doesn't count I also
called make a bunch of people oh wow
that's so what you're saying he doesn't
count and you're going after his weight
at the same time I'm sorry you're an
awful awful person I mean you weigh more
than him although you have about like
five inches on himself Nick just you
know capitals I am multiple people I am
me and all the people I aid Luke has his
voice back that was so confusing for a
lot of people cuz we released a video
that I filmed on the second day first
right and then other ones later so
everyone was like what is even happening
always confusing and it's like that
happens when I get when I let my hair
get like really long really short and
then it's kind of just changing for a
bit I mean we've we've had ones where my
hair gets cut in the middle of a video
yeah like a good guide yeah so we've got
a bunch of great topics for you guys
today um no not really it's gonna be
kind of odd
we're probably gonna lean on the events
that we were at yeah it's gonna be a
little topic light but we'll have fun
cuz we haven't seen each other in over a
week I think because we've just been
like busy flying around to like amazing
places like San Francisco and Boston hey
man hey man I got to go to San Fran
Boston's pretty cool I wrote a bicycle
in San Fran I got lost on a bike
rode a bicycle in Boston you could have
except one of the gaas
probably doesn't have like a bike share
program no I think they do
wait like what do you mean it's like
it's like car sharing but like yeah bike
racks it's just all American cities are
just inherently it's super I saw it too
and I was like that's pretty smart
it's great one of the guys that I was
with I was just in it why didn't you
stop right with the Winchester um one of
the guys that I was hanging out with
while I was there yeah
doughnut bacon I think bacon donut they
can bacon doughnut um
rent walked into literally almost walked
into Stephen Hawking no I was on his
phone
oh and then I've been mortified even
Hawking's like huge beast bodyguard was
like no and stiff-armed him and then he
was like uh uh what and looks up and
then there's Stephen Hawking cuz they're
in Boston and like MIT and Harvard and
stuff so it makes sense he was giving a
lecture or something like literally
almost soft its jaw and then proceeds to
after being stopped takes a picture
does he even ask like even asked like
I'm embarrassed for how embarrassed you
must have been for him because that that
is awful that is awful like you don't
you don't bump into people you don't
bump into famous people this is why
don't bump into people in wheelchairs
you don't bump into respected people you
don't you know there's so many layers of
you don't do that to this and this and
this is why people are trying to make
looking at your phone while walking
illegal yeah yeah because people are
gonna walk into Stephen Hawking luckily
Stephen Hawking has an attentive and
large scary bodyguard right apparently
quite nice but just was like yo you know
actually no don't do that um so Apple
just announced his worst quarter in over
a decade
boohoo fifty million iPhones sold uh
Intel is on board the whole replacing
the headphone jack with USB thing really
Intel really you usually do two topics
Oh
for some reason I forgot that you're
needed one I thought that was your first
one anyways Blizzard has finally
responded to fans about the closure of
the nest rottenness Tahlia servers and
people are both super stoked and like
but we'll get into why later on space
explains to send its Dragon spacecraft
to Mars using the Falcon heavy rocket
and that is dick yeah you should call it
like the are they planning to like enter
the atmosphere with it like like punch
punch through the atmosphere with Wow
why did I think he's alone
it's like dancing Linda alright what did
you do ah screw topics what do you do
what did I do
so I iced I got up at 4 a.m.
oh wow today so like when I go to bed
I'm already very tired talking about
tired tired more that's a good job yeah
so I was so I was up at 4 in the morning
I got on a plane I worked on the plane
because I didn't want to waste all the
preparation I had done to do work on the
plane and then I I did a thing that yes
I had someone in my family died so I
went there and I did that can I help you
oh okay okay Nick was in space and
anyway so then I this place and when
show yeah but before that the question
you were actually asking was I spent the
week at the Samsung developer conference
so it all kind of kicked off with a big
keynote they announced retail
availability coming in a couple days
which it has now been so now as a twelve
hours ago
of the gear 360 their new 360 degree VR
optimised camera they announced some
some stuff that actually didn't make it
into my videos from the show but is
really cool if you want to see not to
give someone a shout out who like super
doesn't ever need shoutouts but if you
want to see some actually pretty good
representative gear 360 footage check
out Casey nice tats oscar coverage he
has stuff where he's like he walks down
the red carpet with it and then he has
like watching leo win an oscar from the
stands with it and you can spin the
camera around and everything and kind of
see how footage from that would look and
sound which is actually something that i
was wondering so he has the gear 360 he
was the first person to get one and he
got one like right
so yeah gear 360 it's finally available
for purchase I was hands-on with it it's
pretty cool it's not entirely seamless
so we didn't manage to crash the demo
because we're me why is that surprising
so of course I managed to break the demo
so basically the way it works as it
records to the camera itself the live
Wi-Fi direct feed is actually really
really good like it's pretty low latency
there's there's it's one of those things
for like yeah it's not perfect but
there's pretty much no excuse for not
having gotten the shot so you use your
phone as a live feed and you can like
look around and then you actually press
record on either device it records to
the camera and then on your phone with
an app you've actually got a like a
browser that you can go through and you
can kind of go oh
you know I want this I want this I want
this it converts it transfers over and
from there you can either view it just
kind of normally or you can view it with
the phone using the motion sensors or
you can view it with the Samsung gear VR
yeah so there's a lot of different ways
to consume it it's very very cool
actually you know because if they like
probably not this version but if they
released like a ruggedized more
industrial kind of version will be
pretty cool but just like from knowing
my brother who's a firefighter it'd be
pretty sweet if they can have them on
like at the top of their helmets right
there chief outside could switch between
person right and see what they're seeing
that would actually one of them can
radio back and be like chief you've got
an obstruction or something and then he
can like see it so it'd be almost like
like video game style very much right so
he's now like the RTS like master
managing his little like firefighter
minions exactly I'll be awesome you have
like axe firefighter
and hose firefighter you have to like
manage positioning them I think you're a
little far but what a few years ago I
was trying to develop a firefighting
video game sure something along with I'm
not even kidding it was anyways and then
I was like wow I'm bad at programming I
should not so other than the gear 360 I
mean the the developer conference was
really geared more towards developers so
they're there yeah there was a lot of
stuff like around their new Arctic
Hardware as well as the Arctic ARR type
a yeah Arctic so it's cut it goes from
the Arctic one is this more Arduino type
thing and the Arctic 10 is like capable
of machine learning it's got like this
gigantic developer board it's like this
big got a bunch of like wireless modules
like all kinds of like much much more
functionality and people were building
things that could interact with their
cloud service that sits behind Arctic
from other clouds and then they were
putting artic hardware in devices and
interact
with these other clouds so they had like
everything from a water purifier to
smart home stuff to a you know that
geebo stupid thing that I backed on
IndieGoGo they had something actually
that looks functionally very similar to
what the Gebo team is promising to
deliver at some point just as kind of a
tech demo yeah like hey geebo who's
George Clooney yeah do you both like a
dude
backs in things aren't sorry not Gebo I
forgot forget what they call it though
that I ended up probably the highlight
of the trip though for me was was there
I got to meet real celebrities like not
like fake Oh fake Oh YouTube celebrities
like you know people who you know
perform musical concerts so I
interviewed Flo Rida who's coming out
with a mobile game welcome to my game
yeah it should oh my god I really hope
that's how it was I really sincerely
doubt that that is how it will load
because that actually wouldn't really
make it welcome to my game why not go
racing I've done now there's no more
that's probably for the best song ends
so anyway hmm yeah yeah anyway I'm sorry
so what is the game about what do you do
well okay so I did ask him what's unique
about it and he basically said well fast
cars I'm like okay like like the flyest
cars okay so we've got that down to
fluid curse no flyest
okay yeah fly is like a fly oh and then
the other thing is like he's in it so
like his music is involved in the
soundtrack okay other than that
details are very scarce so I do know
that he I do know that he spent some
time actually on a track and then spent
some time like I'm sure he needed to do
that with the control zone yeah I don't
think he was even I don't think he was
pretending you needed to do that
I don't think that I don't think that's
the thing that happened I think that
basically he wanted to and did it
because he's Flo Rida no yeah so that's
fair he spent some time with the
controls like making sure that they got
everything right he actually says he
spent a lot of time like making sure
they had the the feel of the game
exactly the way he wanted it so yeah
that's uh it sounds pretty cool i I'm
I'm genuinely gonna try it sure I it's
called speed gods
the title is all caps bold and
italicized and that like III double
check to make sure that it wasn't just
that he's like defines the game yeah I
check to make sure that it wasn't like
just just a logo and it's not like when
they write it just in text about you
know a press release or whatever it is
italicized bolded and all caps that
really good so then Tommy fair guitarist
for kis all things he's releasing a
children's storytelling app that he
wrote all the music for but not kiss
music hopefully yeah so I was talking to
him a buddy who's like yeah this was
like a really different creative
challenge for me we're planning to add
it's kind of like semi animated okay and
then it's got he calls them kiddies so
he wrote little diddies story he's like
ya know listen I'd be kind of cool
actually that one I will check out as
well that one's come out doesn't sound
like a mirror of every single other game
in its genre yeah but I mean what that
said you can't you can't say like oh
this racing game won't be good because
there are other racing no it could be it
could be good I just like I know I have
a few different friends that are in like
mobile game development and like out of
the few different they all work at
different Studios whoa okay two of them
work at the same one but whatever out of
those ones almost all of them have
worked on a racing game for mobile right
yes when we need them suck one of them
was good that's the problem is like I
tend to dismiss the entire genre like I
got the same initial reaction as you now
it'll probably be Tara
and from a purely numbers perspective it
will probably be terrible yeah but maybe
it won't if not that's cool I like the
idea and again one of them was ok it was
just far too pay2win they had they had
some other really cool demos they had a
roller coaster with like like a 40
roller coaster with like moving seats
and stuff with gear VR which man it's
like it's one of those things where I'm
like I know I'm at the Samsung developer
conference so I know we really have to
wear gear VR s for this boy do I ever
wish I was wearing an oculus or a vibe
yeah because we're not when you when we
hear about like that rollercoaster that
just installed gear VR s I'm just like
damn it guys like use something else
there's so much like there's there's so
much of a greater Hardware requirement
by the other ones like there's so much
more investment whereas like gear VR is
you just throw a bunch of phones in a
bunch of like probably Samsung gave them
a pretty good deal to implement that
because of all the press around around
something like that yeah so it just kind
of it just kind of is what it is in the
cases of something like that anyway the
demo was cool because I've never
actually done like a rollercoaster demo
with the moving chair it's amazing how
close you can get to like a zero-g feel
just with a moving chair science man
scientists are cool and then the last
demo but the right but the latency the
latency and the resolution are just the
resolution yeah but the vibe in oculus
like the resolution you know you can see
it sometimes like it's it's it's an
improvement will be good but they're
pretty good and let you jump down to a
gear the graphics are pretty rough too
like playing have you played a space
pirate trainer no oh you have to play it
yeah it's on my account I saw right yeah
I saw it on there I just decided that I
was gonna spend most of my time in raw
data because I knew that you hadn't
right so I thought we could combine
insurances yeah yeah space pirate
trainer is a total freaking blast but
like the graphics are not that great
and there's like a good and a better
slider right now and the better slider
which doesn't look very good is
apparently like 980 and up optimized
last cool demo that I did was and these
guys these guys there
I asked them what their company did and
they're like yeah so our company sets up
like experiential demos for our brands
and I was tempted to ask them I didn't
end up doing it I kind of wish that I
had I was tempted to ask them
so did Samsung pay you to be here or did
you volunteer to be here slash pay for a
booth here in order to meet developers
I'm actually not sure who's winning in
this is their demo was really cool so
they had this escape room style thing
and then they were using each of the
eight cameras above this very small room
like like less than the total range of
an HTC vive with the two lighthouses so
well each of those eight cameras is
worth thirty five hundred smackeroonies
oh yeah and then they had these they had
like these objects like like pieces of a
puzzle very very like Tomb Raider very
like Uncharted style puzzles move
statues around and do this stuff
the graphics running off of the gear VR
on an s7 by far the most impressive demo
I saw there because there was another VR
game like a tech demo game that I saw
were you like blast bad guys or
something a lot of the problems like
you're kind of jaded the crisis rock
climbing game yet no I haven't like
there's there's there are VR demos that
have very good graphics the problem is
the vast majority of people making VR
think I'm even gonna keep saying demos
because they're basically all just demos
even the games like are all tech dudes
trying to get like feasibility across
like look this is what we were able to
make not necessarily like oh it's so
beautiful
right
that would be nice so the graphics were
really impressive latency was as good as
you can possibly expect because it was
running on a gear VR but it was
believable enough with like magnets on
some of the objects to kind of get them
to click into place like it would in a
game and they had just those little I
are reflective dots on the object so
that the cameras would know what was
what that you could like solve like like
a color matching and like move the
object to here align the light beam take
the take the golden idol and then the
door opens and you run for it and
apparently it was believable enough they
actually have had people slammed into
the wall forgetting that the door
opening in VR is not is this a potential
liability issue oh yeah for VR companies
yeah but that's part of the reason why
like okay I'm on my video that I made
comparing like the revived in the oculus
rift before they released but with final
specs for release yeah like current
state of VR video thing I talked about
how amazing the chaperone system is and
a whole bunch of people were like oh
it's like there can be that great
because like games aren't gonna put it
into their game because why would they
do that stuff like they don't put it
into the game like you walk up to the
wall and there's a blue thing like it's
just it's a warning system they're not
gonna just like block it anyways and
that's super helpful because lo and
behold in the setup that I have over
there almost walked into a palette yep
it was like oh well I'm super glad I
didn't walk into the palette and rift is
going to be getting a room scale issue
experience once the touch controllers
come out right because it's gonna have a
second camera it won't be as wooden to
anywhere near as wide as the five is
right now but you'll be able to stand up
and move around a little bit so that the
room scaled to a certain degree and
that's gonna be a little scary there's
no pass-through camera because with the
vibe you can double tap the thing yes
co-pastor which is extremely
disorienting yeah this is true but
somewhat function helpful and like if
your phone's going off or something you
can double tap it and check your phone
without taking the camera or the headset
off and sitting on the top of your head
and getting grease on the lenses
oh right so it's actually really nice
right you want to not take the headset
off once it's on until you're done right
to be completely honest you don't want
to like rest it on top of your head like
a lot of you did I send it to you with
grease on the lenses I don't think so oh
okay cuz I tried to be pretty careful no
but like I was doing demos for everybody
so between the most cleaner myself
because people would be like that was
really cool and I'd be like time to
clean everything again but safety yeah I
know yeah so the rift doesn't have that
which kind of sucks a lot I'm gonna
start divulging into rift versus vive
real quick okay yeah well we do have
more topics yes cable has been purchased
by Charter Communications 78 billion
dollars billion I mean is that yeah yeah
I like this is does this even mean
anything to anyone it's official
uncle sam says charter can buy Time
Warner Cable they just approved the
seventy eight billion dollar deal today
whose charter I have to confess as
someone who is not American and doesn't
pay that much attention to huge American
mega corporations I am actually not sure
what all of the companies that that the
mega corporation that is charter
probably owns so in a nutshell the US
Department of Justice Justice approved
an FCC Chairman Tom wheeler spoke in
favor of the deal on Monday it does
still need to be approved by the FCC
itself Tom wheeler supports it but the
FCC has not given official approval
there are caveats to the deal Charter is
not allowed to impede access to
streaming content is not allowed to
impose data caps or charge usage based
prices and is not allowed to charge
interconnection fees a wheeler says that
all three seven-year conditions will
help consumers by benefitting online
video provider competition it is unclear
though what he means by seven year
conditions weather that means that they
can impose data caps and impede access
after seven years is up or what yeah
this apparently also covers charters
purchase of Bright House Networks the
cable provider that has most of its
market share in Florida for ten point
four billion dollars spectrum our
charter spectrum just seems to be like
an ISP they have internet they have
phone they have cable TV gives packages
I've never heard of these guys how are
they so big that they're buying Time
Warner who have definitely heard of
multiple times if they do they not are
they not as big of jerks
as the other companies that would be a
good thing yeah looks like the usual
seems super normal yeah TV internet
voice I don't know
cool yeah I suppose involved comcast
speaking of American American companies
buying expensive things yeah bought out
DreamWorks for 3.8 billion so there NBC
Universal division is actually acquiring
the dreamworks animation studio for
about 3.8 billion i mean it's all just
you know rounding rounding at that point
it's funny how ten million dollars could
literally just be like an
inconsequential rounding error yeah okay
listen to this
Charter Communications is an American
cable telecommunications company which
offers their services to consumers and
businesses under the branding of charter
spectrum which is exactly what we just
found yeah providing services to 5.9
million customers in 29 states it is the
4th largest cable operator in the United
States by subscribers behind Comcast
Time Warner Time Warner Cable and Cox
Communications why were they able to buy
Time Warner I don't know why didn't Time
Warner buy them
great question and if Colton's had put
more detail in the dock that I didn't
look at because I was at a conference
and at a funeral then we would know but
it's a good question yeah I like the way
you think Thanks so I don't know this
seems so weird anyways sorry I am
actually surprised that something like
DreamWorks costs as little as four
billion dollars yeah because like what
anyway I don't like like I hear you I
mean we're talking How to Train Your
Dragon its franchise Trek franchise I'm
assuming that they are owning the IP
behind these particular works I mean How
to Train Your Dragon has a Netflix
series that is going right now as a
continuation of the movies what does
DreamWorks done recently um Wow I'm glad
you asked DreamWorks asked you so many
in new English why do they not have the
sex appeal of picsArt okay so for one
thing they haven't been quite as
consistent in terms of the what they've
delivered like certain stuff has been
great Shrek great How to Train Your
Dragon great the Croods I really
well-received I thought it was awful
never mind Kung Fu Panda though is
DreamWorks but this is interesting i
mean i guess i'm sort of overestimating
how much these are worth potentially i
mean its feature films have grossed
thirteen point eight five billion
worldwide this is just according to the
wikipedia articles so take it with the
grain of wikipedia salt and it's unclear
whether or not that includes licensed
products for example but yeah i don't i
don't know i guess i just i would have
thought that that it would be that would
be worth more than that Madagascar is
also DreamWorks it's just the reason why
I said that was because what like how
deterring the dragon is the last thing
that I can think of from them that was
super awesome and the first one of that
is a little yeah the most recent one is
did you watch the Penguins of Madagascar
movie no again that's actually
it's not that new either but it's hard
to mean it's hard for us to know sort of
what they have in the pipeline right now
like you know if they have like oh yeah
we've got like a bunch of like crazy
awesome product projects going like look
at all this awesome stuff that we've got
I just feel like it's been a while and I
love little animated movies so like I
see a lot of these things like I'm a
grown dude and frozen was great but like
it's been a while since I've gone to
something and it's been like DreamWorks
yeah you know what I mean and on that
note why don't we get into our sponsors
for today yep first up is master AAB so
the product we're highlighting today is
the master op x high five man re at zero
zero im's this is a unity boot of the
re0 that brought quite a bit of fame to
the HiFi man name in the earphone space
they boast a comfortable fit and
standard setting sound clarity the re
zero zeros feature a revised cable for
better durability and improved
microphonic so that is the like annoying
noise when something bumps the cable I
feature a nine millimeter dynamic driver
64 ohm impedance and a 53 inch cable and
the main change to on the reboot aside
from all that other stuff I just said is
the price it's only 35 bucks shipped to
your door if you're in the u.s.
international orders will be charged $5
at checkout for Freight over 1400 units
have been sold already at the drop page
which you can find at draw ups slash Len
- re - zero zero which will obviously
have linked in the video description so
that you guys can actually find it if
you're not familiar with mass drop they
offer all kinds of deals like this
whether it's on knives or keyboards or
audio products say for example I can't
beam gear even and the idea is they find
manufacturers who are willing to commit
to a lower price if mass drop can find a
lot of people to buy so the more people
buy the lower the price goes and
everyone basically wins
speaking of everyone basically winning
if you feel like it's a win if you pay
less for your shaving supplies and don't
have to go out and buy them then you
might want to try Dollar Shave Club

story actually that I need to tell here
so one wipe Charlies when I was at PAX
East peppermint scented I really wish I
had at least one of these bought wipes
for men available in travel size which
would have been great so what happened
was we were on the floor all day it's a
long day we got there early we stayed
for the entire event stay for a little
bit after the event because exhibitor
badges yes and then went for dinner
afterwards once we get to the restaurant
I'm like I get my one washroom break for
the whole day go to the washroom the
stall I'm in doesn't have toilet paper
the only other stall in the bathroom
does not have toilet paper
there is no paper towel in the dispenser
thing it's completely gone and no one
has told anyone in the restaurant
fortunate I'm gonna stop details there
but it was a disaster and if I had one
wife Charlie everything wouldn't be fine
I posted a picture of like the toilet
paper roll being empty and like
immediately their comments were like why
didn't you ever one what Charlie it was
like damn it it sounds like a shitty
situation ha ha ha ah so head over to

started rolling um
hackers stole eighty million dollars
from a central bank because it had $10
switches and no firewall god so the
original article here is from UK
Business Insider and okay okay the opie
of this his name is paranoid wallet
that's amazing I love that that's the
best lineup of like Opie name and
article that I think every awesome
so Bangladesh his central bank was
vulnerable to hackers because it did not
have a firewall it used second-hand $10
switches to network computers connected
to the Swift Global payment network Wow
these shortcomings made it easier for
hackers to break into the system earlier
this year so the head of the forensic
training institute said it could be
difficult to hack if there was a
firewall the last of the lack of
sophisticated switches and get this this
makes it even worse than that
sophisticated switches means that it is
now after the fact very difficult for
investigators to figure out what the
hackers did probably more or less
impossible and where they might have
been based because if you don't have
detailed data logging and I mean based
on that they broke in earlier this year
it's not like they broke in yesterday
they just transferred a bunch of money
and like now they have broken the
connection okay let's check the logs
from yesterday
not great so Swift is the Society for
worldwide interbank financial
telecommunication so that's yeah
apparently part of the blame is falling
on them as well
I am I don't really know why but I'm
assuming that part of the blame is
falling on them because if you're going
to allow something like the worldwide
interbank financial telecommunication to
go somewhere you should probably make
sure that that place is secured at all
I'm assuming that's why the blame
especially well how do you I mean how do
you oversee that but how many like like
I feel like you could be completely
honest like every single gas pump has a
check-up every once in a while that's
true yeah like they should at least have
like someone go by every once in a while
hey has a server room going yeah
everything on fire what do you guys mind
giving us like any material doing
literally buy everything on eBay
yesterday for $10 less and is it used
yeah I don't know some amount of at
least oversight at all I mean on the
same I have more than two thousand
employees at Swift speaking of oversight
and Wornall the German nuclear plant
infected with computer viruses says an
operator apparently this is just like
really real rod software really old
malware Wow
can we get some good news for this week
things that shouldn't be connected to
the Internet there's a seventy five
miles away from Munich and it's been
harboring malware it didn't pose a
threat though apparently because the
computer was not hooked up to the
Internet Wow names I haven't heard of
before apparently the viruses included W
32 dot remnant and Conficker I thought
was conflict so it was in a computer
that was retrofitted in 2008 with data
visualization software associated with
equipment for moving nuclear fuel rods
the malware was also found on 18
removable data drives mainly USB sticks
in the office and
youie says it had increased
cybersecurity measures as a result
excellent okay we have good news
google has patent a sort of good news
okay well Google has patented maybe
hopefully means that were closer to it
happening but Google has patented smart
lenses that you inject into your eyes so
we covered like this and I think 2014
and I don't actually think the idea or
the concept has really changed but now
it has been patented meaning that
hopefully someone's going to do
something with it yeah and hopefully if
they don't they are not buttheads about
it
yeah like the people that stock mineral
oil computers to be sold from the device
is meant to replace your eyes natural
lens it is injected in a solution that
congeals and attaches to your lens
capsule and is mostly meant to correct
poor vision it contains a number of tiny
components storage sensors radio battery
and an electronic lens and the eyeball
device gets power wirelessly from an
energy harvesting antenna the patent
describes what would look like an
external a device to interface with the
eyeball computer and the tool
communicate through a radio and the
interface device contains the actual
processor to do the necessary computing
considering it it replaces your current
lens what happens if it runs out of
battery that's a great question and like
in the future our EMPs just gonna make
everyone blind so these lenses are now a
part of verily a division under alphabet
okay I you know what you are you are
just the difficult question person
yesterday yep I don't know I use dirt
are you just going through the topics
and kind of going yep I'm not gonna say
anything when this comes up until the
end and then I'm gonna just drop a bomb
that's unanswerable them in which you
just move off thank you for that Apple
just announced its worst quarter in over
a decade mostly due to syncing iPhone
sales which is not surprising because
you have to make something better in
order to sell more of them
wow this is better than the six I know
but like by how much it has
3d touch okay which is touch but in 3d
last time Apple sales fell
year-over-year was the first quarter of
2003
that is fantastic 13 years ago currently
more than two-thirds of apples revenue
is made up of iPhone sales which is
pretty intense the iPhone in q1 of 2015
sold sixty 1.2 million in q1 2016 was
fifty 1.2 million also known as down by
16% iPad is down by 19 percent and Mac
is down by 12% so everything is down by
double digits excellent just yeah and
like iPad especially so screw of one
that was like tablets gonna take over
computers no go away yeah I mean with
that said Intel is sort of not super
bullish on the PC either no part of the
issue may just be that Hardware in both
categories is getting to the point where
it mostly does what most people want it
I can't think of anything I have wanted
to do on a tablet that I can't do on an
iPad - mm-hmm especially because the
iPad 2 still is getting software updates
I mean sure it doesn't have the same
responsiveness when I auto-rotate it's
not fan and the battery life isn't as
good as it used to be but like firing up
the Netflix because that's what it turns
out we actually don't have this I mean I
actually had you've met him my old my
old boss
so I remember him explaining to me that
oh I do all of my work on the iPad now
like after after he left and he did the
whole like startup thing like he wanted
to do a startup and he was showing me
like a presentation and he pulled out an
iPad and I was like you don't like have
a computer because we worked together at
a computer store you know he's like oh
no I do all my work on this now and I'm
like okay okay we'll see how long that
lasts yeah this long this is how long it
lasted before everyone remembered that
keyboards exist for a reason and that
there
really really good this at things like
being a keyboard being a keyboard I pad
screens are very good high especially
find like I am getting to the point
where people don't realize I'm on my
phone on hangouts like yeah yeah they
don't actually know I can trick people
some great check yeah um especially with
SwiftKey I like the the comment during
scaphoid worse what do you type really
fast or whatever I don't remember
exactly how he said it but bob was just
commenting on you typing oh yeah um but
but but part of it is a well-trained
Swift key you have to commit like you
have to commit to it because it really
does learn over time a well-trained
swift key can compensate for us
dull phishing errors so between that and
having gotten better at it I can type
pretty fast on a phone but there is
nothing you can do to type quickly on a
tablet yep and like yes there are split
keyboards and but the tablet is so heavy
it's very fatiguing and if you have it
in your lap they have a device that's
named after sitting in your lap has a
keyboard on it anyways technically it's
not named after sitting in your lap it's
named after being on top of you laughs
yes
so that was originally posted by Phoenix
arising on the forum I really don't know
what Apple's response to this is gonna
be this is this is really I mean I sort
of covered this in my iPhone se review
they should make VR stuff where I talked
to fair bit they don't even believe in
touchscreens on laptops yet are we
really gonna convince them that you know
a headset that I just like yeah they've
been selling computers with unfriendly
underpowered graphics for years yeah my
only my only reason for saying that
right now is that like while it's my
reviews coming soon uh-huh but um well
it's not like really ready yet
that's what's gonna be hard to do in the
future right for computers for a little
while
word processing was hard to do that was
literally a thing and then now like
we're getting further and further and
further and now like things just aren't
hard to do so why upgrade your computer
on its even gaming's just not that hard
to do these days yeah because no one's
like really pushing the envelope well
that and there's the ten-year console
development cycle that it looks like
we're breaking here hopefully it looks
like we're breaking with the ps4 K or
psvr or whatever then no I think the
actual heads that might be called PSV
are so PlayStation 4 and a half whatever
but VR is very hard to do you need lots
of them frames and you need them really
quickly um so yeah if they do that then
hardware gets pushed such an oversight
that they that they that they didn't
alright you know what I guess it's still
very early days there's plenty there's
plenty of time for them to come in and
FaceTime oh yeah you know the VR
industry I guess there's probably years
before it's no longer early days like
just so I like it
I mean Apple watch I don't think they've
released any actual sales figures on
Apple watch in a while but my take on
that is that's gotta have been an
unmitigated disaster like anyone I
explained it to where I'm like yeah the
screens off unless you go like this so
like not stupid like if they're not
technology people why would why would
they do that I've been enjoying this
thing it's a Fitbit oh yeah the new one
it has a analog style clock I don't even
I can read it I just don't even bother I
don't wear it to check the time and
weird for my heart rate it's usually on
this screen or I can see heart rate
right that's what I wear for like I was
doing I was talking with VR again but I
was doing the raw data demos and it's a
movable combat simulator right right
people like Burkle get really into it
right and he can't see me but I'm trying
to manage the cable for him so it's
literally like I'm basically sparring
with Burkle
because he's like go to reload and then
shoving his gun back out it's like woah
oh my god and like I'm jumping around
him trying not to get hit that's awesome
and I'm running it like a hundred and
thirty BPM right it was cool to be able
to like while I'm managing the cable
like oh cool
alright that's where that's going I
don't need to check the time all the
time so yeah Luke's working finally it's
one of those categories that we just
really haven't
haven't touched actually is fitness
trackers and Luke's working on kind of a
fitness tracker accuracy showdown type
of thing for when we go to Mexico which
is not next week but the week after can
you believe it so I'm trying to figure
out and if you guys have opinions on
this let me know because the internet
seems to not have a ton of data on it
but the best like chest strap heart rate
sensor to use as a like good data
comparison yeah drop that in the
comments that would be super helpful
that would be very very helpful looking
at a Polaris one and like a couple other
ones but then like you need special
watches that aren't the fitness trackers
that anyone's buying in order to use
them and stuff right so what if you know
things about that obviously powerful but
yeah so I covered a lot of this in in my
in my iPhone se review or I kind of went
Apple is not defining categories right
now at all they've they've tried they
they tried to kind of reinvent the iPad
as a device with a pencil
I mean stylus I mean something would
have jobs said they would never do they
tried to do a watch and it turned out
that their vision for the watch which
isn't necessarily the wrong vision but
isn't ready yet the hardware is just not
there yet they've seemed to have just
completely abandoned the Mac I actually
screwed something up in my em aside
vortex review where I said the Mac Pro
could have up to 18 course I didn't even
conceive of Apple not having updated
that for now the current generation of
the previous one the previous ones three
generations of Intel processors it only
goes up to twelve core because it is LGA
2011 not LGA 2011 three I just I didn't
even I didn't even bother looking at
because I haven't paid attention to the
Mac Pro since it launched but they're
just not even they're not even trying at
all and then it's just kind of like
oh I guess your revenues down there
still trying on iPhone and we'll see
what the SE does to this number because
it really is a solid upgrade device for
people who are running iPhone 5s and
they will have to upgrade Linley all
64-bit app store drops mhm
that'll be interesting anyways Nintendo
NX 2 launched in March of 2017 and some
people are a little salty because the
Zelda game which looks amazing and has
looked amazing since what 2014 or
something when we first started seeing
screenshots of it and was supposed to
release in I believe 2015 I think is not
launching this year and will be
launching in 2017 probably with the NX
and we'll work on the NX and will also
work on the Wii U meaning if it's like
probably what I'm expecting it's gonna
be like you'll get an awesome experience
on the NX and you'll get a hopefully
good but not as awesome get the Twilight
Twilight Princess on the Gamecube
experience which actually is kind of a
funny thing to bring up because while
the graphics were much worse on the
Gamecube for Twilight Princess many
people argued that the GameCubes
controller was a lot better than the go
like this to make link slash controls on
the week that's pretty bad you can plug
a GameCube controller into me I actually
played the entire game with the Wii mote
though Wow but what I can tell you is
that what happens eventually is you're
like you're chilling on the couch hold
on let me just go back a little bit so I
can sort of simulate sort of leaning
back on the couch here so you're kind of
like chilling on the couch like this and
then the Wemo it's kind of in your hand
you just like mm-hmm
well there's like okay I'm gonna get a
little crude here for a moment but this
is actually like years ago not for a
long time I don't know if you can still
find the video but someone made a video
about how you can beat every game on Wii
so this is like not even Wii U days is a
very old YouTube video but you can beat
every game on Wii by doing like a male
masturbation motion you just take the we
stick and just and you just win
everything
really and like beating like a whole
bunch of games okay it wasn't like yeah
probably not
and like you please okay okay okay okay
movement games I'm like he showed a
montage of a lot of games and him
beating it that way and it was pretty
funny
what was that even intentional what a
montage of games and him beating it that
way oh gosh that was not intentional it
was great that was supposed to buy since
Terron the forum next one was supposed
to buy Alex P 10 V 2 original article
here's from the verge apparently Intel
is is gonna get behind this whole no
headphone jack thing we're gonna do
audio over USB type-c what the crap guys
I don't get it unless they want to have
two of them that's what bugs me a bit
because like there's huge points in time
where I would want to have headphones
plugged in and a charger and I don't
think battery bank companies are gonna
start adding like headphone jacks to
their battery banks no and I have a lot
of other concerns here too like for
example in theory this is great because
USB type-c has amazing data rates power
delivery up to a hundred watts or 95
watts or whatever it is yeah you could
even get things like thermal
temperatures out of eight stuff yep yeah
you could you could do microphones on
you could do microphones much more
universally for example so you can
actually have your headphone have
software in it so that it would work
properly with volume control its track
skipping on Apple or on Android and and
you could you could do way more than
just that like you could have like sick
lights on your in ears like there's a
lot of cool stuff to be said not saying
it isn't cool yeah about USB audio
however the issue is that unless it's
implemented well it's gonna be a real
drag because and to be clear I don't
know exactly what the plan is here if we
can utilize the type C port to just pass
through a signal from a DAC an amp in
the device or an external device for
people who want like a high-end amp and
DAC to the headphones or the in ears
passively then great but if we are
relying then on the headphones to have
their own amplifier and digital analog
converter we are either dramatically
increasing the cost of anything decent
or yeah or we are ending up with
possibly and on the DAC side I'm not
necessarily sold on needing a super
fancy DAC it's been it's been
demonstrated pretty conclusively by
Tom's hardware that like even a super
basic onboard sound computer DAC with
the decent amplification is as good as
pretty much anything um but I'm not that
sold on the backside but on the amp side
of things we're probably gonna end up
with amps that are not that great and
we're also gonna end up buying a new DAC
and amp every time we buy a new pair of
headphones it just adds cost in a way
and complexity in a way that I don't
think they're trying to use it
thickness I I don't know I cuz headphone
jack has been something they've been
complaining about in terms of thickness
it makes me super sag so they're doing
all this for thickness like wow you're
going the wrong direction I mean I have
other issues with the headphone jack
it's also not particularly robust but
it's so compatible like it can be
adapted to the quarter inch jack it can
be used on anything from like an AV
receiver from 20 years ago all the way
up to the latest iPhone to to your car
with an auxilary input like it's just as
long as and like I don't even like a USB
type-c to three-and-a-half millimeter
adapter is good enough but if it goes
ubiquitous like if by the time my kid
has a phone there's a Type C Jack on
literally everything that handles these
duties that can also work with outboard
amps and Dax and the entire ecosystem it
catches up a slash over takes the older
analog solution then maybe but I like
I'm gonna have a hard time saying
goodbye to older headphones that I mean
it felt like a module like a module a
USBC consortium or whatever it's called
yeah I just I don't really know I don't
really know what to say about this I'm
not a huge fan I feels like something
that is sort of unnecessary but I see
why they're doing it because in addition
to any thickness concerns with the
three-and-a-half millimeter jack there
are also complexity concerns with
putting the amps and the DAX inside the
device as we continue to try and make it
smaller and consume less power
yeah so if you can have a battery
powered optionally battery powered or
also powered off the device external
thing I don't really want to power stuff
off my phone like I don't
I want more battery in my phone I don't
want to take stuff from
and I've heard arguments that I forget
what it is exactly about Sennheiser's
Orpheus - or whatever they call their
new $50,000 headphone but they actually
do have some amplification if I recall
correctly in the headphones because
having it closer to the driver was able
to maintain better signal integrity and
stuff and stuff it's just I'm not sold
on that approach making as much sense
for a pair of plastic headphones from
the Apple Store that's a brightly
colored as it does for a green yeah
fifty thousand dollar product where that
that difference in signal integrity is
still probably pretty hard to pick up on
yeah so they're promoting so here's
here's in a nutshell what's on like a
fundamental gold slide remove the
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
from sources so analog audio okay this
is actually a little bit more details
this page wasn't loading before analog
audio is basically a connector
replacement and then they want to
promote the move from analog to digital
so volume and shrinking transistors will
reduce the cost over time users see and
value improved digital headset features
do you value digital headset features no
okay
the only one that I can really even
think of is surround don't care which I
do not use yep me neither
so yeah yeah also there is no reason why
you couldn't do that processing on the
device because two speakers is still two
speakers so whether you're gonna do your
surround processing in the headphones or
whether you're gonna do it on the device
to actually just really doesn't make
much of a difference it's just where you
do that digital processing because
you're still have you still have to go
to analog at some point if you want to
make sound alright sorry I'm just trying
to deal with yeah no it's fine a lot of
this stuff is I can talk about mr. Elias
while I do this because I don't need to
yeah sure so this was originally posted
on the forum by no one um but we've got
the original article here on battle.net
go ahead and pull that up it is a sticky
and it is a pretty popular sticky if you
know what I mean so basically this is
the first time since Blizzard pulled
down Australia's that they're actually
responding you should probably explain
what Australia says it's a vanilla Wow
server that was community supported
effectively a pirate server but they
were offering a gameplay experience that
Blizzard was not willing or or
necessarily able to offer yeah and they
were not doing it for commercial gain
which doesn't mean that you can just no
take someone's IP see our coverage last
week it's two weeks ago vanilla WoW is
essentially a nickname of sorts for the
original version of World of Warcraft
which has been essentially completely
obliterated on the current retail
version of World of Warcraft in order to
make room for their new stuff which kind
of makes sense but if you look at their
subscriber numbers it kind of backs up
the idea that their new stuff sucks so
people want to play their old stuff and
a lot of people did want to actually
play it so they went on this free server
which is a pirate server which is kind
of stealing blizzards IP which is kind
of sort of totally completely not okay
so Blizzard takes it down and they don't
say anything
until more or less now this post goes up
nostalgia responded to this post saying
that yes in fact like it says in this
post they have talked to us even to the
point of saying that they are apparently
going to Blizzard HQ and we'll have an
update this weekend so it does actually
sound like something might legitimately
be happening which is good so a lot of
people are kind of stoked about that
hope that kind of like honestly it
sounds like they might actually be
releasing their own servers which from
the nostalgia screw and from everyone
that I know including myself that played
on misterios is what we want we super
just want Blizzard to do it because that
would be so much better because one they
get to be greedy and take all of our
money which is great take the money for
the thing that you made Blizzard that's
awesome no one is trying to make it so
that you can't take the money for the
thing that you built that is fair but
it's it's good to have like a proper
company running these things so that you
know the next time you log in it's gonna
be there because exactly that happened
tried to login and it wasn't there it
was that so the the maybe not-so-great
part of this whole letter was when they
went like yeah but we've been thinking
about this other thing called pristine
servers what pristine servers are is
it's the current version of world
Warcraft exactly like it is now except
no experience scaling know like realm
transfers and no bind on account gear
and like a few other things so like you
get to play the new shitty game but with
like maybe slightly less I was
trying not to swear
wow I didn't work I went the whole
stream until right there so when other
news space acts plans to send it to
Dragon spacecraft to Mars using the
Falcon heavy rocket because they are
just so good at names that sound so
awesome Falcon heavy rocket the they
believe that this mission can provide
key data to SpaceX as the company
develops an overall plan to send humans
to Mars basically they want to just do
it so they can kind of see what
complications and whatnot they may have
which is cool that makes sense
freaking awesome how should we learn how
to do the thing well maybe if we do the
thing let's just spend all the money
yeah and do all the things and then
we'll know what things about those
things don't worry at the same time
though this can be definitely seen as an
investment because they just won a
military contract for massive amounts of
money to put a satellite in space this
is the first time in like a huge period
of time that like Boeing and whoever
else didn't get that contract right so
by showing that they're awesome they're
getting these really good contracts from
NASA in the military and if they're like
look we're already working on Mars and
we have all the really good data for
to Mars you should probably work with us
if you want to get there
or if you want to go further than that
or further than orbit then that could
win them more contracts than you so
there are some challenges the atmosphere
on Mars is so thin that it provides
little braking capacity so they plan to
use an upgraded spacecraft a dragon - if
you will powered by eight super Draco
engines management using propulsion more
details to be unveiled at the
International Astronautical conference
from September 26 to September 30th I
want to go to that just to say I went
where were you as we handled the
International Astronautical conference
this is their propulsive hover test so
insane
that's amazing oh man oh man oh okay
anyway I'll just stop in fact I'm just
gonna I'm gonna call the whole thing now
okay that's fair thank you guys very
much for tuning in to the wine show we
will see you again next week
