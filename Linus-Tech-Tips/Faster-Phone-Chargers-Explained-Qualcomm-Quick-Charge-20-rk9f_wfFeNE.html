the same right you plug it into the wall
you throw a USB cable on it then you
plug it into the Lightning or micro USB
or whatever other connector there is on
your phone and call it a day or night if
you charge your devices at night which
would make sense because look never mind
that
the point is easy right wrong and you
know what else is wrong

of homeroom water cooling when
realistically they're at least two weeks
out and yet I'd do it anyway cooler

close February 7th 2015 click now to
learn more so four years ago life was
relatively simple at least as far as
five volt chargers for phones and
tablets when you had your USB ports on
your computer or very low end wall warts
that output 500 milliamps the typical
ones and the ones bundled with your
phones which are usually one amp ish and
premium aftermarket ones and the bundled
ones of tablets which were usually 2 or
2.1 amps now even in those days though
you sometimes needed interoperability
between your charger and the device
being charged in order to take advantage
of the best possible charging rates
because beefier componentry is required
to prevent the device and/or its battery
from being damaged by the charging
process so phone manufacturers like
Apple and Samsung used little signalling
tricks that would allow their chargers
to communicate with their devices to let
them know hey it's ok to draw more power
fast forward to 2012 and the
introduction of Qualcomm quick charge
1.0 an attempt to standardize faster
charging so more customers could
leverage it at least those customers
whose phones contain qualcomm processors
version 1.0 was all about optimizing
charge times with 5 volt 2 amp adapters
that you already own with a fancy power
management IC built into the device
itself all the user needed to know was
that his or her gadget was charging
faster especially when it was very low
version 2.0 which started showing up in
devices like the HTC One m8 in early
2014 takes
beyond device hardware a step further
and allows it to accept up to three amps
from a five volt power supply and even
other voltages as well up to twelve
whoops
volts but the tricky thing is that while
both the devices and the chargers are
backwards compatible with older lower
power ones to take full advantage of
quick charge 2.0 we need drastically
different power sources that can deliver
the aforementioned greater current and
varying voltages so if you want to be
sure it supports quick charge 2.0 check
the box it'll say quick charge 2.0 and
it'll come with a pretty steep price tag
for the up for a freaking wall board so
the question then is is it worth the
investment
well Qualcomm claims that compared to
conventional charging so 5 volt 1 amp
quick charge 2.0 can fill your battery
up to 5 times more in the same time and
even compared to quick charge 1.0 it's
twice as fast but their results while
surely very scientific we're done on a
bare battery as far as I can tell and
their form might not really reflect
exactly the results we'll see in the
real world so I brought this test to the
real world suckas i used a nexus 6 from
google manufactured by Motorola and
tested it in four different scenarios
first with an apple 1 amp charger that
I've had since I got my iPhone 4 second
with a 2 amp wall wart that I got with
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 third with
the quick charge 2.0 charger included in
the Nexus 6 is box and finally with a
third-party quick charge 2.0 charger
from pure gear to see if the rated
current at the various charging voltages
makes a difference on this device anyway
since they're actually a touch lower
than Motorola's bundled turbo charger
maybe that contributes to pure gears
smaller size as well actually now before
beginning I needed a testing methodology
obviously I couldn't just power down the
phone and plug it in and stare at it
until it was finish so here's what I did
I ran a 3d game with the flashlight on
to drain the battery until the phone
powered off then I plugged it in briefly
powered it back on and let it sit at the
home screen until it reached 3% any
lower and it would shut down
again I put it in airplane mode and
closed all apps except for battery
monitor widget which I configured to
pull the battery level once every minute
because a big part of the benefit of
quick charge is not necessarily the
overall charge time to 100% but rather
the charge time to go from empty to a
reasonable level when you're desperate
and we need more plot points than just
start and end in order to get that so to
ensure we were getting the best possible
experience a one-foot micro-b USB cable
was used since the cable length can have
an impact on charging power and I ended
up with the graph that you see here each
charge test was run twice to ensure that
nothing weird happened so I consider
these results accurate to within plus or
minus a few percent and overall I
learned a few things number one quick
charge 2.0 is faster than other
solutions number two most two amp
Chargers out there you can see I have
quite a few of them here are either
incapable of handshaking with many
devices and enabling faster charging
rates or they just plain suck most of
them topped out around 1.5 amps number 3
all the 1 amp chargers I have lying
around deliver more than one amp
including the Apple one that I used for
my benchmarks which was the closest to
one amp out of the bunch and number four
thanks to Qualcomm standardizing this
stuff a third-party quick charge 2.0
charger will deliver basically the same
results as a first party one something
that hasn't always been the case in the
past with proprietary standards so cool
beans faster charging is good right
I mean it's not quite as fast as I was
hoping but it's definitely faster
actually not always it's great if your
phone is almost dead and you've got a
blind date in half an hour and you need
to make sure you can you know text your
friends from the dinner table if it's
not going well or if it is going well oh
he's so wonderful but juicing up your
battery with a higher current charger
generates more heat which can negatively
impact the battery's overall life spent
how many charge and discharge cycles it
can handle and given that so many
batteries are non replaceable these days
this is a bit of a concern so whenever
you're plugging in for the night even
though you have support for quick charge
2.0
I'd recommend sticking with a low speed
charger so thanks for watching guys like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you thought it sucked leave a comment if
your feelings were more complicated in
this let me know what were you expecting
out of all of this do genuinely want to
read your comments as always you can
find a link in the video description to
support us you can buy a cool t-shirt
like this one you can send us a monthly
contribution if you think our videos are
great and you want us to keep making
them and you can change your amazon
bookmark to one with our affiliate code
so whenever you're shopping for quick
chargers or whatever else the case may
be we get a small kickback from you
making that purchase that kind of thing
helps us out a lot thanks again for
watching and as always don't forget to
