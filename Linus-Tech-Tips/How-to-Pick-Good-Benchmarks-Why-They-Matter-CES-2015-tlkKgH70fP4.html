brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX
alright so before we were so rudely
interrupted there we were trying to
start a video here in the intel PR suite
now this is the first time I've ever
actually managed to get in touch with
intel's PR folks i an error that both
sides are were sort of quick to hug it
out over and you know make up and we're
going to work together moving forward in
the future but the whole point of what
they're showing here is the importance
of benchmarks and not just benchmarks
but benchmarks that can be validated and
that can be trusted so there's three
basic types of benchmarks in the world
there's going to be your consortium
benchmarks where there's a group of
large companies that all work together
to keep each other in check and make
sure that everything is fair and
balanced in the results there's going to
be your open source benchmarks that are
going to have communities behind them
that are going to that means sometimes
maybe you got to pay twenty bucks
like the one that's over to my right
there in order to have a peek at the
source code make sure there's no
tomfoolery we'll talk about that one in
a minute
then there's your closed benchmarks
which often you'll have to pay an
exorbitant fee in order to get access to
the source code and poke at it so really
there's no community moderation so the
point of all this was they're showing
off tablet mark why do they care about
tablet mark well tablet marks from bap
KO and the reason they care about it is
because for the first time in a while
intel has what they feel is a clear and
solid lead in the tablet excuse me sorry
icy tablet I meant PC space pcs that are
extremely thin to have screens on one
side backings on the other not a ton of
Io okay I'm just going to call them
tablets I'm sorry guys so they have a
deposition in the tablet space that puts
them in a well a very very strong
position moving forward so here they're
showing off some pretty crazy stuff this
right here is a core m 5y10 turbo is up
to 2.6 gigahertz so the kinds of use
cases that they want to show off with
tablet mark are going to be your typical
tablet things so adding filters to a
photo web browsing video playback stuff
like that and this one in particular is
a consortium benchmark so there's a
group a large group of companies very
large come
these that are trying to make it so that
well it's important for them to validate
on their side but also so that consumers
know what to look for when they're
shopping for a tablet now moving over
here we've got an example of this is a
this is just an open completely open
benchmark and this one's really
different from that one in that it's
called see our expert and unlike that
one which is actually Android iOS and
Windows cross-platform allowing us to
finally actually know how the iPad
compares to an Android tablet compared
to a Windows tablet scuse me PC sorry
did I say tablet again compared to a
very slim Windows PC with a screen on
one side this one only runs on Chrome OS
it does the same kind of stuff so it's
going to run through your you know your
typical web browsing look up your stock
portfolio whatever else the case may be
but the reason this one came about was
because we didn't really have a way of
knowing aside from I don't know like
click refresh with like a stopwatch and
see if you can figure out like how fast
the page look we didn't really have a
way to quantify well who makes the best
Chromebook and here they've got some
solutions from you know Intel and brand
n or brand a actually they did they put
labels right on it I guess it's because
this is a press suite and not
necessarily meant to have people running
around in here videoing but the idea was
to quantify well which Chromebook
actually is the best and gives you the
best battery life after all and it's not
an Intel benchmark this is an open
benchmark so so the point of working
with these guys it's it's going to
enable new types of projects that we not
going to necessarily tackle in the past
so you guys have loved seeing stuff like
our whole room liquid cooling thing well
we've had a lot of people ask us for
stuff like hey it's back to school I got
to buy a notebook how do I determine
which one's the best one well with with
some assistance on streamlining the
process we want to hear from you guys
what type of content you want to see
from us in terms of stuff that's more
roundup oriented because we don't have a
team of you know 16 people to run around
and you know benchmark Chromebooks all
day so if these guys are pointing us in
the right direction providing us with a
bunch of stuff from Intel we go and we
find stuff from competitors we get some
feedback from those guys as well make
sure we're presenting the most balanced
suite possible that gives us way on way
more authoritative voice on this kind of
what should you buy type content so
leave comments on this video
I will be checking them out let us know
what you want us to benchmark
particularly on the mobile side so guys
thanks for watching this video on in the
Intel like PR suite that I've never been
present for before they have so much
cool stuff here guys don't forget to
