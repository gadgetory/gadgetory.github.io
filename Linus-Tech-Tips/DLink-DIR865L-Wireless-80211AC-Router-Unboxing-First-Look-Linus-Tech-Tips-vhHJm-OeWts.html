D links next-generation premium router
this is the dir 865 L it is a dual band
AC router now I mean nobody consulted
with me about this nobody asked me what
I thought before they called the next
generation wireless AC I I can't
understand why they didn't ask me what I
thought but I think it's just the most
ridiculous thing in the world because
you got a and then you got B and then we
skip to G and then we were like wow okay
well we skip letters before so we'll go
to n this time and then they're like oh
well there's all these letters left in
the alphabet so why don't we just go
back to a and put a C on it instead of
going with like I don't know where Alice
x4 extreme or anyway wireless AC is
faster and more better particularly the
5 gigahertz band is better utilized with
wireless AC to be more faster and more
better but that doesn't prevent these
routers from being backwards compatible
so this guy right here uses where we got
yeah so it has combined 1300 AC plus 450
and for a maximum total throughput of it
being capable of 1750 megabit per second
which is very very very cool stuff and
what it means is that unlike some other
AC routers on the market this will not
be a downgrade for all of your end
devices because remember guys if you
have a wireless AC router that's 1380 C
and only 150 n or 300 n what that means
is every end device on your network is
actually going to be operating at a
slower speed than if you just had a high
end end router so think about that for a
minute
be careful when you upgrade because if
you don't have any AC devices you might
be actually downgrading your wireless
speeds so let's see what else dlink has
to say for themselves about this guy so
yep yep AC and compliant concurrent dual
band 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz
mydlink cloud services share port allows
you to share you know files to various
apps and whatever else you want that's
basically what they call a USB storage
port
and then the mobile app is what they
call their mobile app that helps you to
share stuff anyway integrated
intelligent antenna with high-powered
amplifier gigabit ethernet ports USB 2
media QoS ok that's good that pretty
much covers it ok gigabit ports are 10
times so yeah but I mean it's hard to
it's hard to call gigabit ports a
selling point anymore for me it's more
like you just shouldn't buy anything
with ten hundred ports fastest AC yep
okay and package contents my cloud
service is off so you can manage your
home network from your iPhone iPad or
Android device so this is like Cisco's
Cloud Connect except I haven't tried
this one yet so I hope it's a little bit
I hope it's a little bit sort of more
easy to get around I guess you know or
maybe if you want to use it maybe it's
maybe it's more awesome check your
networking speeds reboot your router see
connected in block devices in real time
okay that's all kind of cool stuff so
let's go ahead and have a look at the
router itself it comes with a Quick
Start Guide okay amplify branding for
this guy so I believe that was what they
used for their whole home router as well
in terms of branding and positioning and
in that particular product it referred
to the directionality of the antennas
that achieved helped it achieve better
overall range which I did test and did
end up being true which is very cool
because a lot of the time you know you
get like oh this wireless router is ten
times the range of your old one and you
actually like plug it in and you're like
well no it isn't because I'm using my
phone now in the same place I used it
last time and it's exactly the same this
is a very shiny product as you can
clearly see we can do the old like test
to find out how glossy it is you can
probably see that it will get quite
scratched quite quickly but the good
news is that it's a router so if it's
ugly it doesn't matter and you can
probably hide it somewhere anyway look
we can see slick oh my goodness it's
like holy crap for those of you who
haven't tuned in already we do live
streams every Friday night and you can
see slick there anyway so what are we
got here four Gigabit Ethernet ports in
the back for your local network your
wind port so you plug your modem into
that you got your USB sharePort got a
power button very nice hard reset switch
12 volt input
and at the front you got a couple more
things so you got power indicator
interwebs indicator as well as a WPS
button the bottom stand seems like it
should be removable because there's like
there's plastic on it then hold on let
me see if I can figure out how to get
this off so I've never seen anything
quite like this before there's two
warranty void if removed stickers here
and then they seem to be screwed into
the base and then there's actually like
a plastic thing here that you'd probably
want to remove somehow and I'm not yeah
I mean I guess you could get it off
somehow but it's just sort of trickier
okay okay I got it I got this there we
go so that's how that works so they're
basically guys what's the point of a/c
routers well they're faster we don't
have many a/c clients yet however d-link
does have an AC 1200 clients so we're
gonna unbox this at some point in the
whoops future help it's not broken now
um yeah it just makes your wireless go
faster particularly at slightly shorter
range remember guys 5 gigahertz is a
higher frequency so that means the
wavelength is much shorter which means
that while you can apparently carry more
data on it it's not quite as effective
over long ranges as 2.4 gigahertz
however with the improvements they've
been making to antenna technology as
well as the transmission strength 5
gigahertz has almost caught up to 2.4
gigahertz to the point where I would
personally assuming I had AC clients
take the benefit of the additional speed
over the slight benefit of more range so
