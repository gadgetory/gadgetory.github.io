gets featured on the when show bill
blogs the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it
alright well it's uh I guess night one
of invidious the way it's meant to be
played twenty thirteen event I guess
we'll start with the tour of the hotel
room so I'm staying at the Marriott and
it seems to me like every hotel ever has
all gotten together and conspired to
make it as difficult as possible to
light up your room so there's the lights
which is here in the hallway that turn
on like you know the one near the coffee
maker and there's another light switch
for the bathroom which is quite nice you
know okay but then beyond that
everything else is like one here and
then like you know another light here
turn them all on it's the most bizarre
thing in the world to me so tomorrow
they're gonna have actually I should
just show you guys the itinerary this
might be interesting to you who knows I
don't know mmm so tomorrow there's
breakfast and video presentation in the
Grand Ballroom so the game works team
and some special guests and there's
lunch with the roundtable discussion and
hands-on gaming I'm not sure what
they'll be showing us exactly then
there's a field trip to a surprise
location there you go you guys can check
this out I don't care
and then the Montreal Canadiens hockey
game so that's so I'm pretty stoked for
that then the next day Friday there's
more presentations with even more extra
they call these guests extra special as
that is that a jab at the special guests
you gotta wonder about that all right
then we've got lunch and hands-on gaming
with new technologies as well as panel
discussion Q&amp;amp;A interviews dinner and
then that's pretty much it so there's a
bunch of more information there I guess
I'll show you guys how I've got things
set up in the old hotel room so I got my
video stuff there video
Lucy Blanchett as well as I mean not
that they're generalizing about
Canadians or anything but a toque with
speakers in it
so for nerdy Canadians here's a moto X
I'm actually working on a review for
I really like it so far it's a good size
it's got a nice grippy back good curved
shape to it really liked it ok Google
now I think you're useless and you
probably look it didn't even work
ok Google now Hey ok Google now wake up
yeah not that impressed with the whole
voice control thing got my laptop set up
haven't decided whether or not I'm gonna
do any live streaming from here or not
but I have the live gamer portable as
well as a micro HDMI cable for the X a
20 camera which is what I'm using now
see that guys I apologize for the audio
being kind of horrible of a mics facing
the wrong way so I got my USB hub never
leave home without it
my mp3 player also known as my old
iPhone that runs iOS 7 which makes
everything slow as old balls I mean
check that out whoa Wow press the lock
button and holy balls kick I'm gonna
unlock that okay so I'm locked ok so
there's something okay check this out I
trust this computer it's ok so there's a
gmail feel free to just like go away
from the video and come back oh for
crying out loud well that's how long it
took to even figure out if it had
internet connection takes forever here's
my little pocket router they don't even
give you wired connections in the rooms
here you just have to use the wireless
fortunately it's not that bad now
there's a bad which has more tech junk
spread out all over it the USB cable
momentum on-ear it's got my in-ear probe
SteelSeries got my HTC One which is
still my daily driver phone and then my
youtube bag ah yes this is cool so this
is probably one of the cooler swag items
that I've seen everyone was wearing them
at dinner tonight this is the LAN hoody
2.0 and it's got like cord locking
system thumb drive pocket inside and all
kinds of hidden something hidden waist
pocket for a mouse
seriously they expect you to put a mouse
in your hood and I think you can put
anything actually this is undoubtedly
one of the cooler swag items I have ever
encountered so you've got a couple of
options for the sleeves it has built-in
gloves which is pretty cool or you can
tuck those away and just put your thumb
through the sleeve
I've never actually owned thumb sleeve
hoodies before cuz I always thought they
were kind of for like I don't know
golf girls in high school at least
wouldn't me when I was young that was
that was the case but at any rate I'm
not sure how practical all of the
pouches and went on are on here I mean
this zipper is not not of particularly
high quality and actually moving it back
and forth is is extremely difficult but
I'm sure they had something in mind the
manufacturer of this garment had some
sort of way that they expected you to
use this and I just can't understand it
but at any rate you can put something in
there and then you know it's funny
AMD halves has an event that they're
doing in Montreal at the same time I was
thinking about going and checking it out
apparently they're showing off 290x and
some like performance numbers and stuff
but I figure I'm here on Nvidia's dimes
so it's probably best to sort of stick
with attending their event there's
another little pouch right here that is
an extremely small pocket I guess you
could put like I don't think you could
even put a condom in there maybe maybe
you could put a condom in there so if
you wanted somewhere to keep a condom
that you didn't want anyone to find it
there's also a slightly bigger one here
that looks like more like you could put
a cell phone or maybe a mouse I don't
know whatever their labeling these
things you can fit a hand in there then
you got your normal pockets you know we
actually have a video upcoming for a
Scottevest product that's like a tech
vest so I think it's kind of a similar
idea to something like this really Wow
ok so here's another another little
zipper that these zippers are her a
little bit sticky I think it's gonna
take a while to break this in there's
another little tiny pouch there there
must be that must be for something so on
the right thumb drive pocket
okay so thumb drive pocket is at least
one of them so it's actually kind of
nice looking got some bright green and
video stops along if I wanted to look
like even more of a walking billboard
for tech companies I've got my Patriots
shirt on underneath it so over here we
see the insides of some of these pockets
lined with Nvidia green we've also got
some Nvidia logos inside the hood itself
which looks a little something like this
and on the other side we've got I yes
this pocket is accessible with the
zipper here and then I think that's
getting pretty close to the end of it
there's like a headphone wire mesh
thing here by the look of things and
then I think there's there's a d-ring
for keys apparently somewhere
I remember where that is okay well
without further ado I guess we'll get
some sleep in to you guys tomorrow
so mr. Stroud over here tells me that
he'd really prefer if I'd I didn't jack
his style
what Blackmagic intensity shuttle it's
pretty terrible
yeah that's pretty well yeah oh portable
and I haven't seen those it's just HDMI
and USB we have the
a lot of gamers we the live game ranch
yeah it's basically a live gamer HD but
no but yeah I mean really it was more to
do with consideration for the other
people in the rooms Wi-Fi connections if
everyone was streaming out of here you
know those people are good sucker right
they would that sucks for them
so I streamed quite a lot of the event
today but I think I'll take a moment
here to just cover what I thought were
sort of the the key points
unlike AMD's event where they really
dropped a bombshell with mantle and
video was more focused on a lot of
things that they already have and then
some enhancements they've made to some
of the things that they already have so
they talked a lot about game developer
relationships I mean AMD's whole
messaging at their GPU 14 event was AMD
is gaming and they're talking about
they're extremely strong developer
relations so Nvidia is quick to react to
that you know putting up slides of all
the game devs that they work with and
all the all the support that they give
to them and you know hey it's like guys
it's you know it's not like we're not
doing this and it's not like we haven't
been doing this for ages with the way
it's meant to be played program one of
the things that they showed up that was
really cool was they talked a lot about
cross-platform in terms of operation and
in terms of development tools so they
showed dev tools running not only on
Windows but also on Linux and they were
demonstrating things that they could do
in terms of real-time analysis of what's
being rendered in within the linux based
developer tools so that was incredibly
cool they also committed ongoing support
for Linux but particularly the steam OS
so by the time steam OS launches they're
saying yet we're gonna be ready to
support it in a big way so that's
extremely exciting I know many gamers
have been trying to get away from
DirectX and windows and and all those
things that it feels like are holding us
back at this point in many ways if you
talk to certain game devs spent some
time talking to Chris Roberts at the at
the AMD event I was at and I mean he
didn't have any kind words to say about
DirectX neither did the gentleman who
was there from EAS
very exciting times and NVIDIA seems to
be fully on board to support that they
showed off project Logan so if you guys
check it out it's their it's their face
works demo where they have an extremely
realistic looking head that you can have
them make different facial expressions
and very very realistic looking they
then revealed that it was running on an
upcoming tiger SOC single digit wattage
power usage and running this extremely
demanding looking demo to the point
where it's like people who are I guess
calling me out for saying that this will
be the last generation of game consoles
that needs to exist in like this large
bulky plugs into your TV form guys it's
happening I mean in videos upcoming Agri
processors are going to make the current
generation or they even the next
generation consoles look like nothing
special so just really exciting if there
were a couple new things that they did
talk about so flex unified GPU physics
is an evolution from their existing GPU
physics which can be used for you know
calculations for colliding bodies or it
can be used for a fluid simulation or
particle simulation or whatever else
well what flex allows is for those
different physics elements to interact
with each other so they showed a couple
of cool demos including one with water
balloons where they were popping them by
clicking on them I didn't think that one
was that impressive but they had a
couple other ones where they were
throwing water at at a large grouping of
hard body objects and then watching them
kind of float around and bounce around
off of each other so we're we're looking
at physics being able to have not only
sort of one thing going on at a time so
to speak but having multiple aspects of
the physics calculations that are being
performed by the game interact with each
other so that's extremely exciting and
then the next thing they showed off with
GI Works which I joked during the
livestream I was actually live-streaming
during a lot of the event
gastrointestinal works no not at all
it's global illumination so what this is
is it is an elegant way you
take some of the work out of what the
game devs are doing they showed
real-time demos in Unreal Engine of how
you can adjust the the fineness you can
adjust the intensity of the way that the
light bounces off so you can either have
stronger shadows or weaker shadows or
you can have shadows and under large
bodies like cars or even down to minut
details like under the door handles of
cars and they even shown a demo where it
was I guess it was museum simulator 2014
anyway they had dinosaur bones and they
were able to demonstrate lighting them
in very unique ways so they had some TVs
with Nvidia logos that were kind of
casting a green glow over everything and
then they had lights that were actually
within the room itself casting different
lighting effects on it and what it is as
instead of programming a bunch of light
sources into the scene game devs can
instead just rely on this real-time
global illumination so that is lights
bouncing off of surfaces the way that
they realistically should to provide
realistic lighting without faking it at
any stage so that's that's extremely
exciting as well so I think that's gonna
be pretty much it for my part 1 vlog of
this event tomorrow we're expecting some
extremely exciting stuff to happen so
stay tuned I'll probably live stream
tomorrow and for now I'm off to tour the
Ubisoft studio but I had to sign this
NDA before I go so I can't I can't tell
you guys about that and then I'm also
heading to the hockey game tonight so
peace out as always don't forget to
subscribe planners tech tips from our
unboxings reviews another computer
videos
another minor detail and videos holiday
bundles have been announced so typically
in the past we've seen maybe one game or
a discount or a free to play bundle or
something like that on Nvidia graphics
cards not so this time around we're
getting Splinter Cell blacklist Batman
Arkham origins and Assassin's Creed
Black Flag with gtx 777 80s and titan so
you're gonna get three games and $100
off an Nvidia shield making that a $1.99
a piece of hardware to augment your
graphics card experience now $100 off
shield $1.99 I can guarantee they're not
making much if any margin on that so is
that a desperation move I've heard
rumors that a shield isn't moving as
well as in video would like or is it
just an attempt to get more shields out
there so people can get them in their
hands and talk about how great they are
around the holiday season and hopefully
spur on some sales later hard to say
what exactly the strategy is there but
it's probably not a bad idea either way
and then the second down tier is going
to be gtx 760 gtx 680 670 660ti and 660
and that Splinter Cell blacklist as well
as Assassin's Creed Black Flag and $50
off an NVIDIA shield one thing I think
we can all agree on looking at this is
it's shots fired at but never settled
but settled bundles that AMD has been
running lately</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
