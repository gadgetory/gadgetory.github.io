DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts so what is AMD
dual graphics it's fairly simple does
using the power of two GPUs together
sounds similar to something
crossfire you say yes it is it is
similar to crossfire and unlike
crossfire is competitor you can actually
use things that are extremely similar
but not identical so in this case you
can use the integrated GPU on AMD's
Kaveri platform to work together with
the dedicated graphics card for better
gaming performance in our configuration
we have an r7 250 with an a-10 78 50 K
and this is one of AMD's recommended
configurations AMD's website is not
currently updated with all available
configurations for this level of dual
graphics but I'm sure it'll update at
some point in time for performance
testing I tested fairly standard stuff I
ran with Far Cry 3 and BioShock Infinite
running both of them at 1080p on high
just to see how well these would do and
the the dual graphics ran a lot better
than just a ferry APU which we can
obviously expect but what was very cool
was how much better it ran that just the
discrete graphics card which was
definitely nice to see another thing to
note is the price per FPS which we also
checked out which is much better running
in dual graphics which you expect as
they're the same cost and it got better
but it was just how much better which
was actually extremely impressive all
right guys I want to do more science but
I need to know if you guys want me to do
more science so in the video below and
on the forum be sure to comment telling
me what you guys want to do what I'm
thinking is maybe some more
configurations around this price range
maybe give or take 50 bucks
to see what competes with dual graphics
outside of this little ecosystem we can
try some cheaper CPUs and try some more
expensive CPUs we can try some more
expensive graphics cards we can bounce
all over the place and just see where
everything lines up in price per
performance and raw performance so what
do you guys think what configurations do
you guys want me to test all that kind
of stuff again below the video or on the
forum while you're here on your YouTube
your tube be sure to favorite and share
the video and like dislike as normal and
also
be sure to subscribe to see all of our
content in the future while you're on
the forum if you get really annoyed by
all the ads all over the place be sure
to become a contributor as at any
contribution level you can get rid of
the ads and if you're looking for a
shirt I know Linus has a holy balls
shirt coming out with some cats and
playing with toys on there because
that's obviously what he's referencing
and you can pick up one of those on our
district line site which you can find
fairly easily I'm sure and it'll be in
the description below the video as
always guys thanks for watching and I'll
see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
