shout-out to Squarespace thanks for
allowing us to be here at CES 2016 so in
walking past the HP booth the thing that
immediately grabbed my attention of
course was the Star Wars co-branded
laptop now to be perfectly clear this is
not a super high performance machine
it's a $6.99 MSRP machine it comes with
a core i5 eight gigs of RAM a one
terabyte hard drive a 1080p but
fortunately IPS display in a form factor
that's not exactly groundbreaking by any
stretch of the imagination but but it
does come with is just a pretty darn
cool concept and the Star Wars branding
is more than just skin deep with Darth
Vader on the top cover a stormtrooper on
the wrist rest and even packaging that
comes in the shape of a TIE fighter you
actually get a ton of exclusive content
with it with everything from visuals to
sound to the Machine optimized for the
Star Wars fan as well as I think it's
something ridiculous like 1,100 photos
in a gallery that comes with it as well
as all the trailers and full resolution
it's got a couple of accessories like
this soft shell case as well as a sort
of I don't know it's that it's sort of
an average feeling bluetooth mouse
clearly for the Star Wars fan but not
necessarily the kind of thing that I
would otherwise geek out over although
this is really cool the touchpad itself
has Luke's readout from the new hope as
they go down the Death Star trench so
that is a pretty cool touch but then I
came over here and they're like well
hold on a second actually this is the
star of the show this is the new folio
and I'm like okay so it's a business
laptop it's a leap book those are cool
they tend to have really nice glass
touch pads they tend to have outstanding
build quality security features things
like touch fingerprint sensors this one
actually doesn't have that but
supposedly with a wink and a nudge
they're investigating other biometric
technologies so it's actually it's
obviously got up actually that looks
like a real sense camera is that a real
sense camera on here I'm getting a bunch
of shrugs but there's two lenses on the
top okay it is definitely not so
although tell me is there investigating
other biometric technologies I can't
tell you guys
more than that but the things that I do
know are the speeds and feeds as well as
the form factor of this sucker so it's
using a core M processor it's a fan
'less design and they basically taken
all that extra space not to mention the
extra power that comes along with the
core M and used it all up to give you
better battery a rocking sound system
and hold on a second I will get back to
that in a moment as well as by far the
best keyboard I have ever encountered on
an HP laptop this size and this weight
which is not really saying anything
because they've never done anything this
thin or this light before but it
actually does feel surprisingly good now
back to the audio quality why would that
matter they actually talk about this
thing I hired to rep screw up and call
it a phone because they really do intend
for it to be used as a business phone
whether it's individually with the 720p
webcam and not to mention the dedicated
hardware Skype buttons for hanging up
and muting all that cool stuff but
actually just as a collaborative device
so you can sit down use the 180 degree
hinge sit across the table from it and
boom now it really is legitimately more
phone than computer I think that pretty
much wraps it up oh yeah no it doesn't
it comes with a 10 hour battery life
with the full HD display it features an
nvme SSD up to 512 gigs they're quoting
10 hours of battery life for the 1080p
but they won't say anything about the 4k
for now we can probably assume it'll be
about two hours to two and a half hours
less than that depending on screen usage
and I think I'm pretty much done yes oh
yeah the audio system is Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
if that matters to people who think Bang
&amp;amp; Olufsen might be a fairly reputable
audio brand so thank you guys for
