Kingston actually i was about to run
into my office and pull all the footage
off of my camera and I found this on my
desk and it's a Kingston media reader
with USB 3 so I'm actually using a super
fast SD card from Patriot in my camera
which means that I can take advantage of
faster USB 3 are read and write speeds
so there you go so it supports SD sdhc
and SDXC compact flash em micro SD micro
sdhc micro SDXC m2m s duo okay so this
is all good stuff and it comes with an
included SuperSpeed USB 3 cable so why
don't we open this a BF this is the fcr
hs3 or as i will call it USB 3 card
reader because that's what i need it to
do FCHS 3 sure alright and comes in that
impossible to open style of clamshell
packaging really gets my goat that's
okay that's okay because I really need
this right now and the timing is
excellent so there you go that's what
the unit looks like this actual this is
actually really nice card reader check
this out okay so it has kind of a glossy
finish on the bottom it's got all your
card reader things here so it's it's um
it's angle C so you can still reach the
bottom cards when you have something
plugged into the top one that's kind of
nice that looks like it might be
activity lights or might not hard to say
or maybe the Kingston one is I don't
know at the back we've got our USB 3
interface so remember USB 3 cables while
backwards compatible with the USB 3
ports on your computer so you can move
smile just whack the camera way to go
Linus okay so what you can do is this
you can plug this guy here and then you
can plug that into a USB 2 port and
it'll make contact with those front four
pins but if you plug it into a USB 3
port there's actually five more pins at
the back that it will make contact with
and that's what's going to give you give
you that extra power and extra
transmission speed that you need for USB
3 devices so there you have it that's my
unboxing of the Kingston
fcr HS three USB 3 flash card reader
thank you for watching and don't forget
