our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys welcome to our highlights in the
Sony booth we have right here the
largest 4k organic LED screen and they
are showing there's actually two of them
there's one on the other side as well
because as you can see actually if you
were to pan around the crowd around this
thing is huge and there's a very good
reason for that the color on this thing
is second to none as is the contrast
ratio so what that means for all of you
CRT guys out there is we finally have an
option that gets us away from LCD away
from the limitations of that platform
there's only so much you can do with LCD
because you have a light that is behind
a liquid crystal panel that means
there's only so much you can do you can
only stop so much late you can only let
so much transmit with organic LED you
are actually have each pixel emitting
its own light so there's no layer in
front of it that gives you as I said
before better color as well as much
better contrast so you can see on the
suits of the guys I hope you can kind of
see it that black is black and white is
white for the first time since we were
using cathode ray tubes for the gamers
out there maybe this isn't quite as
relevant for you twitch counter-strike
players yet because we don't have any
consumer grade PC monitors at the moment
that are using the so LED technology but
we're also going to be back a lot closer
to CRTs in terms of response times
so no pricing yet but there's a 55 and a
65 inch model coming to go with the 85
inch 85 inch right 84 inch sorry sorry
that inch makes all the difference trust
me she knows compared to the 84 inch
that cost $25,000 thanks for watching -
