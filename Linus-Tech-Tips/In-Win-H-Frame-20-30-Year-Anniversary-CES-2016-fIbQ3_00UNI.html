check out their new Signature Series
computer every year they come up with
the new Signature Series computer
there's a few tweaks this time this is
the H frame 2.0 thank you to Squarespace
for sending us here this year check out
their link in the video description down
below not only is it the H frame 2.0 but
it's their 30th year anniversary meaning
that the thumb screws on the outside
have a cool in win logo on it anyways
moving on
it also comes to the power supply which
is the s2 1000 65 watt this is the only
way you can get the power supplies if
you buy this case and they share a few
pretty cool characteristics as has
become standard with the H frame you see
the bladed kind of metal design with the
glass tempered glass windows but what's
cool about this this time is not only
can you only really see through it when
it's illuminated from the inside so it
looks like a mirror if it's not
illuminated from the inside but it
shares that characteristic with the
power supply as we can see the power
spot looks like a mirror when it's
outside of the case and not on but it's
when it's inside the case and on you can
see right through it and see the
components on the inside which I
personally think it's totally sick
there's been some other aesthetic
changes and I would argue improvements
as well the previous H frame was silver
and blue now it's black and orange I
might be a little bit biased that way
considering our company colors but I
actually think it looks super super
sharp
there's LEDs that run along the top and
front of the case and the in wind logo
on the front kind of left hand side
those can be controlled with a little
button dial thing on the front which has
six different settings off 20% 40% 60%
80% or 100% and it will remember that
setting even if you turn the computer
off turn it back on again which is
absolutely kind of cool mount it on the
front you have a USB 3.1 type-c
connector which is pretty cool
three USB 3.0 connectors headphone and
microphone jacks and power and reset
buttons in terms of three and a half
inch and two and a half inch drive bays
for SSDs and hard drives there are six
but you could remove four if you want an
easier time mounting a reservoir
now speaking of reservoir in terms of
water cooling you can fit a three
hundred and sixty millimeter rad up in
the top or a 120 millimeter in the back
meaning you can have a 120 millimeter
fan in the back or three by 120
millimeter fans in the top
it also supports up to an e ATX
motherboard meaning you can fit pretty
much whatever you want in here other
than like that motherboard
used in seven gamers one CPU but I'm
sure you're not worried about building a
30,000 dollar computer so it's probably
fine anyways I really appreciate the
improvements that they've done to the H
frame I was a fan but not a huge fan of
the previous one I think they made a lot
of big improvements here so they might
be winning me over a little bit more let
me know what you guys think in the
comments down below thank you to
Squarespace for sending us here this
year if you need to make a website
because you're so excited about the
colors black and orange that you need to
make a song about it you can go to
Squarespace use one of their templates
make whatever the hell you want make a
commerce page where you can sell your
Christmas songs that were kind of
terrible but now everyone at your
company are professional musicians I
don't know whatever you can do whatever
you want at Squarespace because it's
easy and if you are having trouble you
can use our 24/7 live chat or email
support and if you buy a year you get a
domain for free Squarespace build it
