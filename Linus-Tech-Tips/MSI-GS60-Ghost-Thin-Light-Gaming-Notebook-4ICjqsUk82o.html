DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts by popular
demand here is my video about the msi
gs70 sexy gaming notebook that made big
waves at CES 2014 so let's start with a
brief rundown of the specs it's got a
Haswell 4th gen core i7 4708 q quad-core
processor that's clocked anywhere from
2.4 to 3.4 Giga Hertz depending on the
turbo-boost frequency it's got a 15.6
inch 1920 by 1080 matte IPS display that
uses embedded DisplayPort rather than a
more traditional notebook interface
internally although don't worry too much
about that all you guys need to know is
it looks very beautiful and motion blur
doesn't seem to be a concern here huge
points for using a nice IPS panel and
not using a TN panel on a gaming
notebook
I hope those days are behind us it's got
16 gigs or 12 gigs of ddr3 memory
depending on the SKU and it comes with
the gtx 860m 2 gig with gddr5 memory
graphics card although there's a pro
model coming later that will have an 870
m and will upgrade the screen to a 3k
IPS panel for storage it has a 128 gig M
SATA SSD with either a 1 terabyte or 750
gig 7200 rpm Drive and for network
connectivity it's got a 70 260 802.11 AC
intel wireless card that also includes
bluetooth as well as a killer e 20 200
Gigabit LAN implementation with packet
prioritization the power brick is a
little bit on the larger side but at
least it's thinner than a typical one
there could be some improvement here
especially with what we've seen from a
razer with respect to how power bricks
can be innovated on physically the
laptop is absolutely stunning it's only
nineteen point eight millimeters thick
that makes it about 10 percent thinner
than gigabytes P 34 G and 10 percent
thicker than the Razer Blade 14 it
weighs only one point nine eight
kilograms which makes it marginally
lighter than the Razer Blade 14 in spite
of its significantly larger screen and
overall size
this is achieved with a special
magnesium lithium alloy construction
that manages to feel solid in spite of
the lightness of the material the
overall build quality of this notebook
is a really strong point there's about
as much flex in the screen as my GX 660
from a few years ago except it's much
much thinner and better looking so we'll
do a short tour of the ports around the
outside of the notebook it's gonna drop
that there okay so on the left hand side
we've got a ventilation port as well as
a Kensington lock power into USB 3 ports
microphone and headphone jacks at the
front we have all the indicator LEDs
with everything from drive activity to
wireless - caps lock then on the right
hand side we've got a USB 3 port SD card
reader very nice Thank You MSI for
including that I still use them HDMI out
mini DisplayPort out that the hard-wired
Gigabit LAN I was talking about and
another ventilation port then at the
back we've got two more ventilation
ports and that is pretty much all she
wrote now on the top of the notebook
once you've opened it up you can see
there's a massive grille here that I
initially thought was for speakers but
actually it's for ventilation the
speakers are located instead near the
bottom of the front of the notebook and
beyond pointing out that their
performance doesn't feel worthy of the
Dynaudio co-branding I don't have too
much to say about those speaking of
branding though the back of the notebook
is absolutely beautiful the brushed
aluminum finish here looks even better
in person than it does on camera and the
subtly illuminated gaming series
branding reminds me of a performance
vehicle rather than tacky gamer bling
like on MSI's earlier gaming notebooks
the one disadvantage here as you can see
I'm wearing gloves is that it does tend
to fingerprint pretty aggressively the
keyboard and touchpad locations both
Luke and I noticed almost immediately
that something was a little bit
different about the this layout but it
took me about 30 minutes and a measuring
tape to find exactly what was bothering
me first up the touchpad
is offset to the left and aligned
directly below the home row second the
touchpad and the keyboard have been
moved down to make room for the grill
and loan power button up at the top this
gives it a smaller wrist rest surface
compared to other notebooks this size
the last thing I noticed was that the
real
patient of the start button is an
unnecessary decision on a notebook with
a fully programmable keyboard more on
that later by the way shifted the space
bar to the left quite a bit and I use my
right hand for space most often and it
threw me off a bit at first to be barely
hitting the right edge of the spacebar
rather than being closer to the middle
but aside from those niggles about the
layout the tactile response of this
SteelSeries co-branded RGB backlit
keyboard is surprisingly solid and its
lack of flex combined with a
surprisingly long key travel distant
makes it feel great considering that
it's on a notebook this thin all in all
I was impressed with how quickly and
accurately I could type after a short
adjustment period and I consider the
inclusion of the SteelSeries engine
software powering it a bonus at this
point it gives you four layers of
remapped or macro functionality for
every key per profile an unlimited
number of profiles a wide variety of led
effects including wave breathing in
multiple colors and even some other neat
features like a heat map of your most
frequently used keys so you can analyze
your gaming style and optimize your key
mappings for the shortest travel
distances the touchpad is less
exceptional so all I'll say is that the
subtle chromed accent around the outside
looks really really sharp other than
that it's a touchpad and ok changing
gears a bit I really wasn't sure where
in the review to put this but this
notebook features Nvidia's new battery
boost that lets you save GPU power by
entering a limit to the number of frames
the GPU will drop per second when the
laptop is on battery I found a spot in
crisis that runs at 50 FPS on wall power
and 40 FPS on battery normally and I ran
it both with a 30fps limiter and without
it then I used a time-lapse camera to
see when the battery actually ran down
my limited scenario I only did one test
achieved 47 minutes of playtime versus
45 minutes of playtime without the
limiter so I'll take the 10 FPS over the
2 minutes of extra time in this case but
it's obvious to me that this feature
requires some more investigation so the
only real takeaway here is that if
you're not playing at low details or
running older games that your GPU can
plow through at really high frame rates
you're unlikely to see the 2
time's battery life that nvidia says the
technology is capable of delivering some
other thoughts now both razor with the
blade 14 and gigabyte with the ARS x7
made a big fuss about their cooling
implementation but MSI has been
relatively quiet and even covers up the
bottom of the notebook with a big
warranty void if removed sticker to
prevent inexperienced users from mucking
about in there but the good news is that
as long as you don't physically damage
the inside they will still honor the
one-year global and to your local
warranty so let's find out what makes
the GS 60 so cool while keeping it
within reasonable noise levels first up
it's obvious why on the side doesn't
want end users trying to upgrade this
thing other than the tuna half inch hard
drive and Wi-Fi module nothing is
accessible without removing the entire
motherboard we can get a good look at
the cooling solution though so there are
two blower fan cooling modules that are
connected via heat pipes to the CPU and
GPU and that pull air in from both the
top and the bottom of the notebook when
it's open and then exhausted out both
the sides and the rear we can also see
that the sound system includes two
speakers that I didn't notice before
that fire down and away from the user at
the back of the unit although they
didn't help much I also noticed while I
was poking around that while MSI's
website says the SSD is M SATA the slot
is plugged into is in fact MDOT to a
newer standard that is a derivative of
SATA Express and capable of higher
throughput than M SATA with an
appropriate SSD on top of that there are
actually two of them and MSI confirmed
that they are both functional and a
handy notebook owner could easily throw
a couple of MDOT two SSDs in there in
raid zero for a hefty storage upgrade
with that out of the way let's take a
look at our actual temperatures for a
gaming notebook I expect the keyboard to
stay relatively cool so as not to heat
up your hands while you're gaming and I
use the chassis temperature near the
rear exhaust as a gauge of the overall
cooling efficiency of the notebook I run
Crysis 1 for both of these tests and I'd
say the results are great to the point
where the trade-off between cooling and
onboard sound may have been worth it but
that's going to come down to the
individual to make that decision
alright so who's the competition
for this notebook obvious ones are the
Mac Pro 15 inch the razorblade 14 or
maybe the ARS x7 but those are all
somewhat different sizes with different
feature sets and very different price
points so that makes the conversation
here less about how does it stack up to
the other well built yet thin and
superlight 15.6 inch gave me great
notebooks with HD displays since there
ain't really much out there and more
about who is this product for I mean
well the short answers that is targeted
at the same sorts of folks as those
other models that is to say on-the-go
gamers but with a couple of features
that really differentiate it it's weight
- screen size ratio is a big one and so
is the inclusion of a full size number
pad something that will be important to
many road warriors who want to get some
work done on the thing while they're
traveling the great feeling keyboard and
the fact that all the gamer bling except
the badge on the back is optional and
can be configured in software it keeps
this notebook from falling into the no
one with the money to afford this would
want to be seen with it trap and finally
the strong specs very limited bloatware
although I did see a copy of Norton
there and fairly aggressive pricing
compared to other well-built thin gaming
notebooks makes it a very compelling
option speaking of compelling options
cheero is back with another deal for
Linus tech tips viewers they're gripped
two portable batteries on for $9.99 at
the link in the video description it's
small and hand shaped so you can carry
it around with you and it's one amp

surprisingly large 5200 milliamp hour
internal battery that has enough
capacity to charge an iPhone twice with
capacity to spare and even the beefiest
Android phones at least once or more
it's available in four different colors
I've got the blue one here and the high
quality internal battery can be
recharged around 500 times now if this
sounded like a sales pitch I'm about to
make things even worse because act now
and I'll throw in this flashlight a
$9.99 value free of charge wait that
can't be right
oh wait that can't be right hold on
sorry no no it's not free of charge it's
rechargeable and the grip too is the
flesh LED for a flashlight so fantastic
