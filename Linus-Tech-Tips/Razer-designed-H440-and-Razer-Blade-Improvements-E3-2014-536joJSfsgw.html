alright guys we're here checking out the
NZXT H 440 designed by Razer
this thing looks great I'm it super
stoked with the blackout style and the
green colors we don't see green design
builds all that often but when they're
done right they're done very very right
so what can you tell me about this
system I can tell you about this vision
and who is applicable for this kind of
idea yeah so first and foremost it's the
first case in our new case licensing
program the design by Razer program it's
basically the concept is we want to work
with top case manufacturers and be able
to provide our fans of Razer theme
desktop to build their own dream systems
right so that's that's honestly pretty
much it and what you can see here is
what it is as of right now how can is
our way fans can like try to suggest you
guys cases or like should I tweet at you
or what should they do yeah I mean our
fan base is never shy to share their
opinions with us you know we've got over
5 million followers on Facebook and
we're actively reading those comments
and participating and engaging with them
there so we made an announcement
yesterday we got a tremendous response
already including some suggestions of
things they'd like to see different
different sizes different styles of
cases so we'll take all that feedback
and put that into the plan to work on
the next one awesome so if you guys are
interested in like maybe a dark black
and green themed build but with Razer
logo solar place which looks fantastic
maybe suggest it to him we're gonna move
on and check out their improvements to
the blade now I had to check out the
blade not only because I got to see it
before Linus which is hilariously
awesome but because they have some
really cool improvements so what can you
tell me about what happened to the blade
yeah I think the most noticeable
improvements on the 2014 blade are going
to be the LCD 3200 by 1800 display also
includes a capacitive touch screen to
really take advantage of Windows 8
interface for sure one of my favorite
things actually is the the thermal
differences that you guys have done it
is now colder on the left side where
your palm is going to be on the laptop
more often and a little bit harder on
the right side where it doesn't really
matter and that's going
we find I thought that was a really cool
improvement what have you guys done on
the graphics side of things yeah so what
we did this year was we put in the GTX
870 chip with three gigs of VRAM so
really kind of driving that high res
screen making sure the gaming
performance is up to par and then as you
mentioned the thermals you know when we
crammed in the quad core i7 CPU crammed
in the GTX 870 obviously thermal
management is a huge challenge for our
engineers but they did marvelous things
with it I'm really really proud of them
you're talking about cramming he's quite
serious they're fitting all that into a
laptop that's thinner than a the the
height of a dime that's correct
pretty pretty pretty ridiculous if I say
so myself one really cool thing about
that three gigabytes of vram actually is
a lot of people that I've seen
especially my watchdogs performance
review I've been talking about how they
can't go on ultra settings because it's
saying you should have at least three
gigabytes of vram so it's kuleana so we
do that in a laptop and a ton of people
having problems doing that on a guest
star thanks for watching this video I
hope you guys check out all the other
stuff at e3 if you want to see all the
other u3 content that we have subscribed
illini tech tips thanks to Piper X
