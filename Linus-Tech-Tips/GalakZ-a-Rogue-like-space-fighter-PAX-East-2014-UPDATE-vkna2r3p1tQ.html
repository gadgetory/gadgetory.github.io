2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair alright guys now we're checking
out galaxy so what have you guys done
since PAX Prime I've been hard at work
you know a lot of things have changed we
sort of went from a parsley
procedurally-generated system to a
full-blown roguelike that was a big
change a lot of new content a lot of new
enemies a lot of new abilities we have a
big customizable weapon chain now that's
kind of half implement in this just a
couple pre-baked like versions of the
weapons stuff in but it's a very
flexible pretty comprehensive weapon
upgrade system the hull upgrade system
you know new locations the fact that the
content is now endless like we have a
procedure generated level designer that
you know takes all the things we learned
about what made a solid level in our
earlier version the pacing the timing
the kind of the difficulty ramp up broke
those down into bunch of algorithms and
they were like now recreating that
endlessly so it's awesome even for us
because we plan every day and we get new
adventures every day now so all good
that's probably really nice for someone
who's testing the game actually yeah I
mean tuning everything even though I
designed all the levels like there are
these rooms that have these spawn nodes
where a different kind of enemy can
spawn or a different kind of weapon and
so even though I play them all the time
mate I never know what to expect I don't
you know I don't even recognize the
rooms half the time so it's all good so
you guys aren't even seating off of like
that much core information it's a lot of
randomness well all the rooms are hand
authored you know I go in and I draw out
the space and then I like will choose
like we're enemies could patrol like a
couple different random patrol routes
and then kind of like you know where are
the things like the spikes and all the
spores and all the kind of weird plant
life and stuff aslam where bugs might be
where loot might be so a lot of the loot
is kind of off the hit beaten you know
off the hidden path kind of rolling
around so you have to kind of explore if
you want to get all the cash it's great
right but it's a combat game first
foremost you can always just follow the
arrow to the target you know you never
get lost and they're backtracking and
stuck in the game which is good but
there's a lot of stuff off that beaten
path to go if you want to get more
weapon upgrades and you want to get more
help in cash and missiles and all that
kind of stuff but a lot of times there's
kind of a high cost those big demons and
spiders and all these kind of creepy
things in these tunnels of stuff so
that's one of my favorite things in like
FPS games or space stance or whatever
when it's not necessarily
for exploration I usually like exploring
more because it's like Oh what is going
to happen if i go over here what am I
supposed to go over here am i going to
see something really cool and I going to
get some really interesting loot that
maybe my buddy didn't find me like some
crazy cannon or something I don't know
but that sounds awesome it so anything
else is the you know the interactions
have gotten a lot deeper now so we've
got the four factions your faction the
Imperials the space pirates and then
these giant bugs and they're all at war
too so you know you could like come into
something and have a bunch of guys in
your tail like you've run right into a
big pirate patrol and the Imperials and
fires blow up into some big fight and
you can kind of clean up the remnants
and like get out of the way that your
shields get back into it and you know
you can use the environment and use the
enemies against each other in a lot of
really creative organic ways so it's
just never the same thing it's great
that sounds awesome thanks for giving us
the update on galaxy we're going to be
willing to check out some more updates

subscribe to lie detective to see all of
our packs these content I would
recommend doing it and as always thanks
