table that I've prompt my television on
so I've got NHL gamecenter running here
I'm just watching some highlights
because I don't have a proper
subscription to it I game center is an
example of one of the apps that you can
use with the boxee so the way i have it
hooked up is quite simple i have an
ethernet cable plugged into my powerline
ethernet which goes upstairs to my
router i have an hdmi cable going into
the TV for my audio and video and then i
have a power cable now one of the first
things I noticed about the boxee besides
the cool glowing green logo on the front
is that the remote is outstanding it's
the response is very very snappy and
you've got okay so yes I want to leave
this video you've got what is basically
a four-way directional pad on the front
with a play/pause button as well as a
back or menu button so then you flip it
over to the other side and you've got a
full keyboard you can use the alt button
here to access things like the at sign
pound sign ! numbers all that good stuff
that you might need if you're doing a
little bit of data entry now you can
also instead of using the directional
pad the enter button and play pause etc
here you can also use these buttons so
there's your menu there's your
directional keys there's your enter
pretty cool okay so here let's just go
back so this is in the most popular apps
this is not in the repository so just
looking through some of the ones that
are included remember that Netflix will
be coming before the end of the year so
here you go some of the cool stuff
that's available now with the
subscription for I mean NHL's the one
that I care about but with the
subscription for offer NHL you can
actually go ahead and watch games that
are outside of your area and it's pretty
cool stuff so let's see what's in
cartoon network I haven't actually
installed this app see it's that simple
application installed successfully takes
just about a minute well less than a
minute and then you can go ahead and
check out what's in the the various apps
so I hit down to browse okay oh boo okay
well we can at least check out games
this is going to be one of the
disadvantages I guess in Canada is that
not all of the content is going to be
available here but if you really want to
watch cartoons never fear because there
are other options so if you go into the
repositories I have taken the liberty of
installing the na'vi X as well as fuzz
the DS third-party repository so I had
found some some cartoons on this one so
this is all unsupported unofficial boxy
content now the overall setup process
for the boxee including plugging it in
and running a firmware update at the
beginning and then configuring it to run
on my network probably took about ah gee
maybe 10 minutes hey cool there's a
repository for XKCD who doesn't like
XKCD all kinds of neat stuff for this
anyway the setup was very
straightforward and very very easy to
use now if I could figure out how to
zoom in and that would probably be a
good thing because it's pretty hello
dear Wiccan readers I understand modern
Wiccans are not usually all about the
curses and hexes but Darth Vader was
recently converted as many is still
figuring it all out okay all right well
let's go back let's find some of the
other apps in the repository here okay
I'll I'll come back when I found that
cartoon whoa well I've got some good
news and some bad news the the bad news
is that most of the repositories in the
fuzz the D as well as the other
repository app that I had are not really
all that applicable for Canadians the
good news is that the boxee is still a
very competent media streamer across
your local network so I'm just going to
go ahead
and show you guys one of the things that
I did set up so if i go into movies and
the navigation so intuitive actually if
i go into movies and just click all
it'll actually just grab all the movies
on my home server oh no these aren't for
my home server never mind i wanted to
show you the local content ok so there i
go to files haha oh wait no ok here we
go files movies aha so that just pulls
all of the cover art as well as the
files from all the movies on my home
server and then i can also go to shows
and it'll pull down all the shows from
my home server so at least in the
meantime while we get some more content
here in canada it's pretty effective for
sorting through all of your video files
and playing them it does play 1080p HD
files over the network which is pretty
cool and yeah so I mean it Kenneth it's
not perfect yet for Canadians but there
is definitely a lot of potential here
thanks for checking out my video first
look at the d-link boxee box oh yeah I
wanted to show you guys one of the cool
things I found in na'vi x ah they have a
youtube app and if I go to Canada I can
see Canadian YouTube content and then I
can find the most discussed from today
and I will find my video about whether
or not a tin foil hat blocks your brain
waves from being read by the government
oh I click the wrong one oh I'm watching
Justin Bieber not what I meant to do no
leave please aha boxee can close content
that you didn't mean to watch very
quickly excellent excellent feature so
there we go do tin foil hats really
block your brainwaves and it starts
playing youtube videos further quickly
and even uploading videos right now so
that
how quickly it's able to buffer and
start playing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
