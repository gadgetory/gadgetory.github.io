juice it a boost edition excuse me boost
Edition so I actually think that this
shouldn't even be called the GTX 650 Ti
because it is completely different from
the other one these similarities
basically end at the fact that they both
use PCI Express 3.0 ports they both need
one PCI Express 6 pin power connector
and they both support like DVI monitors
because that is pretty much it the 650
Ti boost reference card has a slightly
longer PCB than the regular 650 Ti you
can see that right there it also has the
extension on here for the exhaust fan so
you can see it's using a much more
similar style to the other gtx 660 heat
out of your case away from all the other
components and also by reference
according to the reference design
supports 3 + 1 display outputs whereas
only non reference GTX 650 T is
supported that so you've got 2 DV is an
HDMI and a DisplayPort whereas this
guy's only got two DVI s and a mini HDMI
the cooler is much beefier it does have
an sli finger so you can support two-way
SLI on this card and the regular 650 TI
could not it has a 192 bit memory bus
compared to only 128 it is clocked at 6
gigahertz on the memory and it has a 980
megahertz core frequency versus only 925
on this card but the real trick is the
fact that it supports GPU boost so it
will achieve a typical GPU boost of over
1 gigahertz around 1033 which makes it
significantly faster than this card but
it also comes in at a significantly
higher price so it's targeting around
169 for the 2 gig model that's another
difference this is a 1 gig card natively
but there will be a 1 gig model
following that's about 20 dollars
cheaper so
this is supposed to slot in in between
something like a 77 70 or a 77 90 we
don't have a 77 90 yet but we'll be
testing that soon and a 78 50 in terms
of price point so we're going to have a
look at how performance shakes down
pretty soon in terms of the physical
size of it the reference card is nine
and a half inches long so you shouldn't
have any trouble fitting it in any kind
of gaming oriented case although it is
not a small form-factor builders dream
like the regular 650 TI which is only
about six inches long so that extra
three inches does make all the
difference in the world
without further ado we're going to move
into our performance numbers starting
with farcry so no test bench test bench
so we're running our thirty-nine 60 X at
four gigahertz with 16 gigs of HyperX
ram all the cards we ran we ran these
650 Ti the 650 Ti boost the 660 the 7770
the 7850 and the 7870 these are the
cards at at our end around that same
price point we use the vertex for 128
gig for our SSD we have a Anandtech high
current Pro Platinum 1000 watt and we're
using a p9 x79 deluxe motherboard from
Asus now as always all of our cards are
overclocked if you want to see our
overclocking settings you can check them
out in the link in the video description
you can see what we're running out we're
aiming for over clocks that you guys can
easily achieve with your cards at home
so we're not pushing them to the
absolute limit in terms of drivers we're
using the latest Nvidia drivers so we
have an unreleased 2 driver for the
Nvidia cards and we have AMD's 13.1
driver because obviously we don't have
an unreleased driver for the AMD cards
because they're all the ones we're
testing are released so let's start with
Far Cry 3 here we see the 7870 in the
7850 topping the charts with the 660
coming in a little bit below the 1750
pretty much the same as within margin of
error and then the 650 Ti boost actually
putting up a really good showing and
this backs up what I was saying about
the 650 Ti boost really not actually
being a 650 Ti at all it is closer to a
660 in terms of performance than it is
to a 650 Ti both the 650 Ti and the 70s
770 dropped enormous ly in terms of the
minimum frame rates in this game
demonstrating that one gig of video
memory is not enough for modern gaming
at 1080p so I would only really suggest
playing Far Cry 3 on either of those 2
cards on a 1680 by 1050 monitor or lower
in Crysis 3 we see the same story except
that the gtx 660 which is on the test
bench right now here wins this one but
again within margin of error against the
7870 the 7850 put up a really good
showing only performing 10% worse than
the 7870 with the 650 Ti boost less than
10% away from the 7850 in spite of the
price differential the 650 Ti again just
choked in this game compared to the 650
ti boost performing about 65% as well as
the 650 ti boost so you are getting a
lot of extra performance for that extra
40 bucks
the 78 700 in the elderscrolls v skyrim
we are running our sort of modded game
with about 18 mods so your performance
may vary in this game however we will be
producing a benchmarking guide for this
game pretty soon so stay tuned for that
our 7870 and 7850 did top the charts in
this one with our 660 and our 650 TI
boost coming very close to each other
only about 5% away from each other in
terms of performance with the 650 Ti and
the 7770 bringing up the rear once again
as the less expensive cards this does
make sense in the witcher 2 we're
running with uber sampling and
anti-aliasing disabled and the Radeon
cards do come out ahead bearing in mind
of course that they are more expensive
with the 660 only leading the 650 Ti
boost by about 10% and then the 77 70
and the 650 Ti again bringing up the
rear we're seeing some pretty good
consistency to the results here which
means that Nvidia has done a good job of
pricing the 650 Ti boost correctly
according to the rest of the market the
2 gigs of RAM to me is a huge selling
point compared to the recently released
77 90 L though we haven't tested it yet
so bear that in mind we will have a
review of that coming soon and we're
going to include
these numbers in there as well so in
Metro 2033 the 7870 comes out on top
followed by the 660 which is in a very
tight pack with the 7850 and the 650 TI
boost it's actually pretty good to see
how close the 650 Ti boost gets to the
78 50 considering that there is a price
differential they're making this one of
the most cost effective to gig cards and
actually suitable for 1080p gaming
because again in Metro 23 both are 77 70
and are 650 TI which are our one gig
cards put up pretty decent average frame
rates and maximum frame rates but their
minimum frame rates were less than half
of the average frame rates meaning they
ran out of video memory buffer at some
point during our testing and absolutely
choked in terms of performance so while
this is a review of the 650 Ti boost I
am looking at it as almost more of an
examination of how much memory we
actually need for modern gaming so the
two games Far Cry 3 and Metro 2033 that
really choked on the one gig cards
demonstrate that 2 gigs is what we need
for 1080p gaming however just because
the card supports three plus one in
Nvidia surround with an auxilary display
doesn't mean you're going to be playing
any triple-a not current gen titles at
three by 1080p resolution you want to do
something like that you got to step up
to a bigger card it's nice to see those
features from a Productivity standpoint
on the card but you know guys make sure
your expectations are realistic thank
