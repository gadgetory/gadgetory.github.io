and I have somehow convinced them to let
me take apart their new Xbox one X and
now you're gonna come along with me as I
reassemble the entire thing starting at
the very base with the Scorpio engine
I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
gaming laptops featured Intel 7th
generation Core i7 processors check them
out at the link below we're gonna start
with the heart of the system the Scorpio
engine as I mentioned earlier it's what
insiders call an SOC or system on a chip
that means it has your CPU and GPU on
board
the CPU is eight cores running at 2.3
gigahertz and the GPU is running at one
point seven two gigahertz with four
TCU's at six teraflops per second and
has other various Polaris features as
well as this was a combined project with
AMD you can't just go buy this chip it
was made for the Xbox one X circling
around the Scorpio engine you have 12
gigs of gddr5 memory running at 326
gigabytes per second and this entire
area is cooled by one large vapor
chamber cooler that has an area in the
bottom this is why it's called a vapor
chamber that has liquid in it and it
actually evaporates from the bottom of
this area just to the top and naturally
goes to the colder areas of this copper
plate before cooling through the fins by
the way if you want to hear more about
vapor chamber cooling check out our tech
cookie video on it right up here
flipping over to the back side of the
board we have the Southbridge and eight
gigs of onboard flash which is used both
for housing part of the operating system
and as a cache for the hard drive said
hard drive just goes into this little
corner in the front and actually has
some cool tech going around it is a
Seagate one terabyte hard drive but it
is on suspended elastic housing so that
vibrations from the hard drive shouldn't
interfere with the rest of the case or
make any noise or bother anything and
that gets carried forward to this
plastic block which manages the cables
coming out from the hard drive to ensure
that they don't touch anything else like
the optical drive that's mounted above
it to connect it with the actual system
it's just a SATA port directly across
from the plastic block and a power
connector directly across from the SATA
port all of the airflow from the Xbox
one X is generated by this 120
millimeter radial fan whose shroud
encases the CPU heatsink that we
covered earlier so it goes right over
top like this now the power supply
similar to the one s is internal but
that's where the similarities end
it is over twice the wattage
capabilities of the one s at two hundred
and forty-five watts it plugs in through
two pins on the bottom which goes into
the board right here and all you have to
do to put it in is line it up push it
down and you're done
it receives air flow from that radial
fan that we mentioned earlier channels
out this way shoots air out of the back
and you're good last of the internal
components but not least is the 4k UHD
blu-ray drive which has a sticker on it
that says engineering sample in big text
which I just absolutely love the cables
for this are not here but it would
essentially just plug in just barely
under the power supply over here an
installation of it is a brain dead easy
just drop it on right there and you're
done now that all the components are in
our next step is to add this metal
shroud and some screws in order to hold
everything together but one quick note
before we do that this honeycomb mesh
right here is really impressive if you
look at other parts of this system the
meshing the metal between the holes is
actually fairly standard it's thick in
this area it is cannot be described as
thick it is extremely thin it's actually
more thin than the thickness of the
metal at all which is kind of insane
they had to come up with their own
method of punching to do this and they
didn't sure me it's still a form of
punching that's that's pretty crazy to
put the internal body together all you
need to do is place it on top make sure
that you got it around everything and
push down fairly gently and then you're
pretty good to go next up is screws you
need to drop those in their respective
places which are fairly straightforward
and then tighten them down the outer
body the parts that you actually really
see when you handle your xbox 1x is in
two parts the top and the nope bottom
and the top we're gonna start with the
bottom first you have to hook it over
top of the optical drive as there's like
a few different grabbing points that
need to line up there and then you're
gonna pull it around the top press down
and there's a couple screws to insert it
on the back but again I
have the screws for that so just don't
worry about that part
Oh assembly complete now all we have to
do is just make sure that it works in
order to do that we'll just turn it on
so I'm just gonna press the power button
in the front and it works we're good
now the i/o on the Xbox 1x is
essentially the same as the i/o and the
Xbox 1s which is cool because if you
want to transfer cables over its just a
one to one no complications there if you
got power HDMI out which has a little
bump on it so if you're feeling from the
front of the Xbox you want to pull it
all the way out you can tell where your
cables supposed to go HDMI in for TV
signals 2 USB 3 ports and IR out if you
want to extend your controller speed if
and Ethernet on the front of the unit we
have an IR receiver and optical drive
eject button for the optical drive that
is right above it a controller pairing
button another USB port and the standard
Xbox power button also please note if
you don't have an Ethernet cable or
don't want to plug in for whatever
reason you can just use the built-in 802
11 AC Wi-Fi anchors sound buds curved
wireless headphones feature optics HD
music and CBC noise cancellation for
clear phone calls customizable ear tips
for a good fit and ear wings to keep the
headphones in place during workouts they
boast 12 and a half hours of music time
and a 10 minute charge will give you an
hour of listening they've got a
water-resistant shell and included in
the box you get the sound buds curved
multiple ear tips silicone and memory
foam ear wings a cord management clip a
shirt clip a micro USB cable a PU
leather carrying pouch and an aluminum
carabiner check them out at Amazon
through the link below now you guys so
much for watching if you liked the video
get subscribed hit that little Bell
things so that it sends you
notifications every freaking time we
upload a video which is every day that's
a fair amount of notification so we
upload cool stuff so you should actually
check it out if you like the video like
it you just like it dislike it check out
the links down in the scription below we
have sponsor links down there there
should be a link of where you can
pre-order this thing but we're filming
this way in advanced when this video is
going to come out so hopefully that's an
option and yeah I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
