DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts now the goal for
the simple audio listen was to design
something that looks gorgeous sounds
amazing and work seamlessly a bold goal
for a relatively unknown brand the
various inputs include USB for PC and
Mac that's driverless three-and-a-half
millimeter line in and Bluetooth the ID
or industrial design is the result of
months of collaboration with BMW design
works USA it uses premium materials
including aluminium if you're european
or aluminum if you're Canadian or
American high quality polycarbonate and
acoustic fabric with tight manufacturing
tolerances Packaging is excellent I mean
it's obvious that whoever is working
over there knows a thing or two about a
eco friendly and be very very appealing
looking packaging and everything is
tucked away quite nicely so the cords
are all wrapped up all nicely
everything's you know packaged nicely I
guess it's not really much else to say
about it
the listen has a pretty unique
capacitive touch interface that is
navigated using gestures and by pressing
on icons around the corners so power to
power it on the volume is controlled by
sliding your finger or touching the bar
in the middle Bluetooth conductivity is
controlled with the Bluetooth button so
just press and hold to engage pairing
mode and line-in illuminates if it
detects a source then brightens it if
it's the active input mute functionality
is pretty self-explanatory you press
that in order to mute it if touching
things sounds like too much work we've
also got an included IR remote control
it won't allow track skipping or pausing
and resuming playback if you're using
the line-in but when listeners connected
via USB to your PC or Mac which doesn't
require any drivers by the way the
remote can be used to control a variety
of music playback programs including
iTunes Windows Media Player and media
monkey it also works when you're
connected via bluetooth now the last
thing you want is something that's all
show and no go and they absolutely are
beautiful they do show but listen
borrows many internal design cues from
the audiophile world it features two way
by amplified
which is just a it's just a fancy way of
saying that it has two separate drivers
each with separate amps to drive them
there's a three inch driver with rare
earth magnets for the mid and low range
and a silk dome ferrofluid cooled
tweeter it also includes a compression
driver to help with the lows which you
can see if you pull the unit apart
although this is not something that is
generally recommended so there's that
passive pressure driver the benefit of
separate amps to drive each of the main
speakers is that it provides plenty of
headroom to reproduce sound correctly at
both low volume and at peak output and
everywhere in between separate amps also
enable the system to use its finely
tuned DSP based active crossovers to
improve dynamic range reduce distortion
and generally give the system better
control over each driver this is a great
feature active crossovers are just plain
better and the main reason less
expensive systems use a passive
crossover is simply to save on the cost
now compression is a word that has a
definite stigma associated with it when
it comes to audio quality but the
intelligent dynamic compression method
used by listens not the same as the
bitrate compression that mp3 audio files
undergo this kind of compression is
designed to control the audio output of
the speakers so that at very high volume
levels you don't encounter clipping or
distortion dynamic compression will
mostly affect the low-frequency or bass
performance of the system but simple
audios got you covered there with a
dedicated subwoofer out port you are
able to add your own powered subwoofer
to the listen to improve your listening
experience listening tests were a bit
tricky for these speakers because my
initial impressions of them from back
when I started this review almost six
months ago were fairly negative given
their price but when I told simple audio
this they retorted that I simply hadn't
experienced other speakers in this price
range and lacks the appropriate context
to do the review so I said okay fine
then and I shelved the review now it
would have been easy for me to just
conclude that simple audio is a bunch of
deluded butt heads and their speakers
are fashion accessory crap and then just
leave them collecting dust but that
wouldn't be very professional and
between simple audio statement and all
the requests that I've gotten for
speaker reviews over the years I figured
maybe it's time to come at this category
from a different angle I ran out and got
both companion fives
Audioengine a 2 plus is a 5 pluses and
some Bowers and Wilkins mmm ones for
context and then set to work reviewing
each and every one of them including
taking another crack at the simple audio
listens and you know what
my conclusion actually changed it's easy
to sit in front of speakers and say now
they don't really sound that great when
your only point of reference is what
your imagination figures $500 speakers
should sound like and you're not doing
side by side a be listening or in this
case ABCDE listening with other real
products that actually exist it's much
harder to find the faults in the listens
when I can see the obvious faults in
other similarly priced products as well
compared to the MM one subjectively the
listens don't look as good to me and
they do not deliver the same
crystal-clear highs but they do deliver
strong stereo imaging equally satisfying
mids and more detailed bass and while
either of them gets loud enough for most
near-field listening at a desk
the listens get much louder than the mmm
ones without any distortion although you
still won't be hosting any parties with
them compared to the audio engineer
pluses which I was expecting to blow the
doors off the premium you know fashion
statement speakers in my roundup from a
price to performance standpoint I'd say
they performed similarly um but better
with a touch more bass without any
tuning and while they do cost much more
unlike the MM ones they're also
delivering some additional functionality
with the touch controls and the
Bluetooth connectivity which is a pretty
big point for these the a5 plus and the
bose companion 5 both wreck the listens
for movie watching and gaming in terms
of bass if you don't add a sub with the
optional port at the back but of course
they're both much larger and therefore
not for everyone and I actually prefer
the listens to the companion fives
anyway for music listening so I guess
it's overall conclusion time ultimately
who is this product designed for and
where is it designed to be used
according to simple audio a variety of
settings I mean the ability of the
listen to sound good is a near field
speaker on your PC desktop and to also
perform well when you use the included
cable extension and set them up further
apart on a speaker stand as a room speed
is touted as a major selling point but
for me I mean as someone who positions
speakers in one place and doesn't move
them much this versatility is of less
value to me especially because it comes
with so many cables and power bricks and
stuff but they're not that convenient to
move around and I also think that
they're just plain better options at
this price if I wanted room speakers but
if I was going to use them in their
wheelhouse near-field listening at a
desk where aesthetics are an important
factor and music listening at a
reasonable level is a priority with no
desire to wake up my neighbors and
having high quality Bluetooth is
important then I've seen much stupider
products than the listens and I'd rather
you buy this than most of the other
fancy Bluetooth speakers on the market
since at least they look good and offer
other options for connectivity in the
longer term thank you very much for

liked it just like it if you just liked
