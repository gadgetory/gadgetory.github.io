will be showing my new chair upgrade so
I'm just gonna bring my new chair into
my office here the cameraman is gonna
sort of follow me in here and I'll show
you all of the improvements have been
made with the new chair versus the old
chair so first of all the old chair is
blue and blue is not a very sleek
executive color so that's clearly bad
right off the bat whereas the new chair
is black and being black it goes with my
computer tower it goes with my headset
it goes with my water bottle my
calculator my sunglasses my keyboard my
monitor well one of my three four four
monitors and my mouse and mouse pad it
does not go with my tan of v8 juice
because that's red and white okay all
the features of this particular chair
first of all it has an adjustable
headrest so if I'm short which I am the
headrest goes there and if I'm tall
which I'm not it goes up there huh okay
it has an adjustable dial back here for
lumbar support so you can see it pushes
it in or out not sure which direction
goes which way but I'm guessing you just
kind of you know salt to taste so to
speak okay so there the lumbar support
has been shown next it has adjustable
arm rests so you press the button here
and you can either lift it up if you're
tall or down if you're short so I'll
leave it right where it is and then we
have another button here I don't know
what this does
I wonder what that does is that for the
back thing hold on ah sometimes adjust
this thing yeah there we go okay so this
switch right here I'll just sit in the
chair to better demonstrate this okay so
the switch I can either make it so that
if I lean back I get back support or if
I lean back I get to
back so this is a pretty comfortable way
to work if I was an executive this is
probably the position that I would work
from I wonder if I can walk it here yes
you can lock it in a leaning back
position okay so that's one of the other
features that I am enjoying about this
chair right now
next I have adjustable height so if I
have long legs then I'll have it up here
and if I have short legs which I do then
I'll bring it more like down here there
we go so I can tuck the chair all the
way into my desk and still use the arm
rests that is a terrific feature right
there also I can spin around like this
and this chair being a black color is
unisex compatible so it can be used by a
male or by a female so we're just going
to bring in a female to come sit in the
chair and demonstrate how it can be used
by a female executive in jeans very
comfortably look at that so that is the
end of your office chair and here I'm
going to bring up these well I'm going
to bring up the NCIX site where we can
see the full lineup of in gear chairs so
this one is two hundred and eighty nine
ninety nine and it is here there you go
so here you can see pictures of
everything that I just showed you in
person and they're actually believe it
or not here here's an interesting tidbit
for you this chair in the photos is
actually the chair that was in the video
so it's not only a photography model but
also a video model okay and then there's
also some other chairs here as well but
I don't know nearly as much about these
ones because in my office I do not get a
high back office chair I get an
executive office chair thank you for
checking out my video on the end gear
chair like many important models this
chair also includes fancy rims so we're
just going to try out these excellent
wheels by going down volume
