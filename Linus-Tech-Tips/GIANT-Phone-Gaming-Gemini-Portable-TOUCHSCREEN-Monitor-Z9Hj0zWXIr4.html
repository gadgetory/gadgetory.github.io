increases your productivity dramatically
whether you're in the office or on the
go be it at the airport in a coffee shop
or just you know hanging out at a
friend's house but oh it's clear that
when it comes to taking two monitors
with you there are a couple of
disadvantages one is that the typical
desktop monitor is a little on the heavy
side and two it's going to require
access to an AC power outlet something
that you won't necessarily have with you
when you're at you know the average
Airport unless you know the airport's
for your from are better equipped than
the ones around here so today's video
then it's all about creating your own
perfect productivity space that you can
take with you and set up virtually
anywhere
yeah but not like that like this that
doesn't better with glass where you can
instantly see your current and past
Network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device use offer code Linus and
get 25% off glass wire at the link below
so the thing about these portable
monitors is they're not exactly a new
concept which sort of raises the
question why exactly are we featuring
these ones especially with a portable
monitor display terminal equipment I
thought that was the company's name but
it's not no it's just this is display
terminal equipment inside the box
and in case you were wondering what kind
of resolving power it has they didn't
even check one for us okay have you ever
heard resolution called resolving power
yes in the context of like a Space
Telescope so for all its rudimentary
enos assuming that that's a word the
packaging is actually not bad I think
it'd be very unlikely to be damaged in
the box and they've got actually a
pretty decent accessory package inside
you've got a that's kind of a shame to
see in 2019 but you've got a regular
sort of DC yeah yeah I forget what
they're called
whatever cylinder a remote it actually
looks kind of like the Nvidia shield TV
one HDMI cable type C to type a and
finally a type C to type C cable
so this is pretty nice actually the
first thing I'm noticing is the bezel
yeah actually except the bottom but if
you think about how its intended to be
used next to a laptop where almost all
of them have that that large bottom
bezel then I it's not gonna stand out
whatsoever and in fact it might even be
better for synchronizing your mouse
movements across the displays okay so it
looks as cool as a tablet but how does
it actually stand up no no I've seen
yeah I've seen ones like this before
so the mechanism honestly doesn't feel
amazing in fact you can see a little bit
of kind of flex in the back there I mean
I don't think it's coming off or
anything but I think a couple more
screws right here and right here under
the hinge would have gone a long way
towards making that feel a little less
flexi but the actual kickstand mechanism
feels pretty good you can go all the way
from quite vertical and it's pretty
sturdy actually all the way down to
about as low as I think you'd need to
like my worst case scenario I think is
like jammed onto like a plain assuming I
can actually balance this on the dinner
tray thing this is metal though right
yeah yeah do you think that's a little
scrape II do you think that was scratch
a desk maybe honestly I'd be less
concerned about scratching and I'd be
more concerned about just slipping in
general I'd want to rubberized foot or
something along there just for that even
what's up with that that looks like
rough so here's the thing this is a
Kickstarter project so these are
pre-production samples but I guess this
is our opportunity to give them feedback
for when they do the finished ones I
would
rust on a product that has just been
taken out of the box to be how you say
it
unacceptable that's it it's magnetic
those are the rusty magnets oh and then
here you've got some labels for the
buttons rear labels why is this not
there's not enough room on the bezel for
them is that as bad an experience as I
think it is though well I did play with
it a little bit earlier and it's not
yeah I didn't like just one of the
things that's actually special about
these guys is that they've got a
built-in battery so you can use them
without access to a wall plug just sort
of part of the joke we were making at
the beginning of the video where I was
carrying around a full-size monitor it's
a five thousand milliamp hour battery
and they claim it'll last you five hours
which is pretty sweet because you don't
want to drain your laptop's battery
that's already out of premium yeah and
that's the way that most of these
external laptop monitors have worked in
the past it's just by plugging in via a
couple of USB plugs so that they can
take both display and power from your
laptop's built-in battery okay cool well
why don't we go ahead and set them up
and take a look at the two different
models so my understanding is this one
is actually 4k correct
and that one's 1080 yes so I'll take
this one then yeah well joke's on you
because this one's touchscreen and that
one's not oh okay well that's actually
kind of cool so there are a couple of
things I immediately notice hooking this
thing up
one is that interestingly you can turn
on HDR and wide color gamut so
technically this appears to be an HDR
display with the only problem being that
if the out-of-the-box experience is
anything to go by it is not nearly
bright enough for me to consider it to
be really truly HDR ready the spec says
300 nits so after trying to enable HDR a
handful of times including disabling the
built-in display here we've determined
that it's not turning on and quite
frankly given that it's really not much
brighter even than the display built
into my blade stealth which is not a
particularly bright display I would say
that you're not going to be having a
true HDR experience on this thing anyway
so I probably wouldn't stress out about
that too much
so the 4k one has got HDMI in and is 4k
60 Hertz by the way so that would be
HDMI too it's got mini DisplayPort it's
got USB type-c and then it's actually
got a couple type-a ports so that USB
type C is an uplink you can use the
thing as a hub plug your keyboard and
mouse into it which is a pretty useful
feature in the age of the dongle given
that you can't take for granted that
your laptop will actually have a type-a
port on it
speaking of things you can't take for
granted on modern devices I had phone
jet so if you're using HDMI and you've
got audio a overreach DMI then you can
pass that through to yourself how's
yours looking no DisplayPort mini or
otherwise but we have HDMI we have two
instead of one but they're the tiny tiny
fine I hate mini HDMI why do you hate it
it's a really flimsy connector so both
the receptacle and the plug itself are
prone to easy breakage because it's so
thin and so wide and plate honestly it's
just pretty poorly designed and what
else do we have here well instead of
having your full-size USB A's
you have micros and then you've got a
USB see again and again your headphone
jack so this is all pretty cool so far
but one of the key pieces of information
that's missing up until this point is
how exactly these stack up against other
options available on the market because
if you can get something like this for
the same price from a brand that you've
ever heard of maybe one with slightly
better build quality obviously I would
recommend going that route instead so we
fired up bnh and it turns out the Zen
screen go 15.6 inch IPS monitor from a
soos is two hundred and eighty nine
dollars so that's actually less than the
MSRP but more than the Kickstarter
pre-order price for the 1080p model here
and it's got a 7800 milliamp hour
battery and that is a significant
increase yeah so these are 5000 however
we haven't been making this video for
nothing I swear there was a reason that
we bothered and that's this the main
difference here is that this has a
touchscreen interface and that just
isn't something
that we've seen for as cheap as this in
the past so that is pretty darn cool
if you've ever tried to find a
touchscreen monitor like not a
replacement for your phone or anything
like that but a touchscreen monitor for
your computer you'd be shocked to find
out how expensive they are so $300 for
one like this that's honestly not the
most amazing display I've ever seen in
terms of the trails behind objects or
the contrast but what it does have is
something that's utterly unique right
now at this price point and that is
touch capability also a matte finish on
the screen which is very unusual for a
touchscreen as for the 4k model well
this one's quite a lot more expensive at
around $500 but it's a 4k portable
monitor which again at the time that we
requested these was not something that
we had seen before
it's definitely sharp but it is not the
best-looking 4k display that I've seen
how was the color accuracy on this guy I
think the deltas are around 5 okay so
that's that's acceptable if you're not a
pro but we've kind of introduced this as
being useful for those people doing
remote work if you're a contract graphic
designer or something you want to be at
a coffee shop
well how about gaming then yeah how
about gave me let's go I've got a type C
2 HDMI and then I can go ahead and plug
into we've got the 1080p touch model
here and theoretically I should be able
to fire up LeFort night
all right you play some fortnight baby
is this even gonna be worthwhile you're
gonna tap the screen you're not holding
a controller we completely could pull
the controlling BRB is that you or me
nice that's not bad that's pretty sweet
that's pretty cool being able to just
like unpack your 15 inch display you
already have a phone pull out a
controller dongle so now that we know
with a little bit of searching for a
controller that doesn't brick things we
could have basically a mobile console
experience just with this and a
controller packed in our bag a couple
cables but James wants to try something
else
so this one actually has a USB type-c
input so we're gonna get rid of this
crappy HDMI mini and try this and see
what happens
do you actually know what's going to
happen nope oh I said well I looked at
their Kickstarter page so we've got the
aspect ratio difference here but that's
possibly something we could adjust as
well actually I want to know what this
is
Oh touch screens on no way yes it's
working yes because it's USB see you can
chill like this and then have it kind of
out do this is like having a 70-inch TV
whoo so we're gonna try an iPhone now
but unfortunately because iPhones don't
use USB type-c that lightning we can't
just use our direct connection we're
gonna have to go back to HDMI dude oh
sure okay and a dog lock it picked it up
right away
interestingly we are piller boxed and
letterboxed but we're getting audio over
the display now why do we why didn't we
get audio ever before maybe we just have
a game volume turned down I might have
had it off those speakers really are not
amazing the latency is not terrible it's
noticeable too
see that yeah but it's usable like if
you're used to gaming on a TV or
something anyway I don't think you're
gonna notice the difference that much
I'm actually considering taking one of
these on my trip that I'm going on today
and it doesn't really add like a ton of
weight especially if I truck it in my
carry-on instead of carrying my backpack
or something that feels very light it's
definitely lighter than an iPad and all
the new ones are pretty thin they're
pretty light it's impressive I think
this probably feels lighter just because
it's bigger it's like lowering density
well what about the iPad pro that's that
size I can look it up damn it it's 1.57
pounds so conclusion here then portable
displays are as cool as they've ever
been even cooler now that they have
built-in batteries and these ones while
not amazing are certainly coming in at a
price where I think that they look
pretty compelling especially if you're
after that touchscreen functionality ok
lines but the people wanted a definitive
answer so can you give us one of those
like emperor gladiator thumb things
he lives okay so here's the thing if
money's no object
I like the 4k one I'm gonna take this
one on my trip however money is a
concern so base n test these but if
you're actually buying one this one
looks like the more compelling option it
does have some significant shortcomings
I don't like the limited brightness and
I don't like the inaccurate colors out
of the box but at anywhere from 240 to
300 depending on whether you pre-order
it or whether you wait wait it looks
like a pretty compelling value if you
have any use of the touchscreen that is
absolutely the killer half of this
display right here the coves drive
wireless earphones feature noise
cancelling to reduce unwanted ambient
sounds they've got a built-in microphone
to answer calls hands-free and they
feature ipx7 water resistance meaning
that the headset can actually be
submerged for up to thirty minutes in
three feet of water the battery provides
five to seven hours of playback and they
stay in place while being lightweight
and durable use code line is 65 to save
