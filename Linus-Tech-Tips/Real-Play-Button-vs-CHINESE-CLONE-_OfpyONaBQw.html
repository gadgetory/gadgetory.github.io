phone for 10 seconds at work geez okay
so this is actually gonna be a lot of
fun we've got a bunch of cool stuff but
the highlight of the show today is our
Chinese knockoff play button it's not
nothing
okay well we'll explain more about that
later my first Dennis I wanted to ask
you a question what do you think of our
new Xbox sudden it's a new model or
something I don't really know I don't
play console games this one right here
you wanted to know if that's a new model
what do you think does it look better
than the Xbox one X it means it looks
bigger and I don't know it's like
industrial look and fit the set right
hold older I don't know I don't yeah
whatever
that's more like pluck in right so okay
there's a video coming soon I'm just
bugging Dennis it doesn't know anything
about it but we've got a sleeper video
coming really soon
featuring the world's most powerful Xbox
one not to be confused with the Xbox one
which is the Xbox model Oh anyone that's
the original Xbox one yeah from like
2003 or 2002 or yeah so we actually put
a super-powerful PC inside it so it
supports our TX real time ray tracing so
cool yeah so it's pretty cool and it's
like completely stealth from the outside
you'd never know but those those ports
on the front yeah those jacks that's cuz
that Xbox used to require wired
controllers so that was where you
plugged in the controllers but they've
all been swapped out for USB so now we
could plug in ps4 controllers or a new
Xbox controllers or anything we want
okay so it's it's pretty sick anyway
anyway that's not what you people yeah
but you need to see yeah just wait wait
for me I'll be right back Dennis
entertain them entertain them my own
show it's my own live show no well I
miss anymore but no more coding we are
doing a live stream that we are
replacing - for this channel from now on
with you yes so because this is our new
set help hey guys how long should I let
them suffer over there okay I cannot
tell any jokes
how long should I let them just sit
there I mean Dennis you scream you
scream I'm sitting on the couch and
camera pointing on me I mean like you
know what's is usually look like I'm
back I'm back I'm back okay so first I
gotta give a shout-out to our sponsor
memory Express there Victoria location
is now open so their new location has
all the same product selection quality
as their other stores and you can click
the link below in order to learn more
okay so first of all YouTube actually
has a couple of different styles of play
buttons that they've had over the years
so because we've been on YouTube for a
very long time sometimes I marvel at
those how old I am and how old the
platform is these days we have samples
of the different kinds of YouTube play
buttons so this is the original 100,000
subscriber play button notice I grabbed
the yeah cuz I knew you were gonna be
here and that was sort of you know a
thing that you love that's good
so memory yeah Memorial you know even if
people subscribe we're not resurrecting
it these we try okay look the thing
about channel's super fun because we've
had a lot of people ask us to bring it
back is I have already said sure go
ahead make a channel super fun not only
can you do it on work time but you can
even just spend any money that was
brought in by the channel super fun
Adsense completely 100% passed through
channel super fun ad revenue to do
something you say any money like No
Limit did I is maybe not
he said no any money
basically didn't care because we haven't
spent any on channel Superfund and it
still makes like a couple hundred bucks
a month in Adsense or something like
that like it's not insignificant so like
if people wanted to go skydiving or some
crazy crap all they have to do is plan
it and take the money and go and nobody
has done it so it's it's like actually
not my fault at this point can we pan
your car again no no no no okay
so the original the original silver play
button was kind of I don't know it's
what about three or four inches by two
and a half three inches really shiny it
actually looks quite nice it's in a
shadowbox
Vexin photo is relatively cheap but yeah
it's an aluminum aluminum frame proper
glass front and then it's just like it's
a pretty standard frame pretty easy to
mount though it's got like really really
strong mounting hardware here which is
pretty cool pretty robust been in the
last couple of years at some point I
don't remember when they did it but
YouTube ditched the og play button and
brought us this honestly it's it's okay
so this is the one we got for tech
linked I also have a similar one for
Linus cat tips this really makes me
regret not doing the cat tips one a lot
sooner because then they could have had
an OG one for it but whatever yeah oh
it's fine it's got a velvet backing
which is this is nice I guess
touch but one thing that's that kind of
stands out to me about this one is it's
quite a bit cheaper that scratched oh no
it's just a hair oh it fogged it's
really cold in here anyway so it's just
got like a shiny I'm not sure if it's
glass or acrylic so I'm not gonna try to
scratch it cuz then it would get
scratched and then it's just got like a
brushed aluminum piece here and then
this is a veneer so this is just like a
single brushed aluminum piece that goes
on top and then this is just like some
kind of screen printing on here so yeah
I like this one more know what what do I
got more yeah this is more modern and
but look at the the shininess of the
plate is plastic I know well no it
actually is No
might be it might be metal coated people
have actually like broken it down and
tried to figure out the composition of
it before I'm not sure about the silver
one definitely and this is also a mirror
that you can actually make a use of it's
like can look at it
Wow you'd have to be a whole other level
of narcissistic to like dude that's yeah
that's how you use it
okay but you guys aren't here to see
real YouTube play buttons you're here to
see the Chinese clone so he got one of
these I'll explain later how we got it
actually we got it quite a while ago but
it's yeah turn the 18th it's it's taken
us until now to unbox it so Dennis come
come on in come in and close David
Dennis do you want to do the honors yes
this is from Bailey Bailey
don't explain how we got it okay open oh
okay oh so this is my ulterior motive
for inviting you to do the stream with
me okay so you can read it okay sure
okay Linus tech tips
Bailey Billy Billy Billy lately CEO
Billy Billy there's another Billy
billion their CEO really Billy yeah okay
okay so can you read this for me so
first of all you can see two like cheers
yeah I says Kombe like Cheers
okay drink beers them okay so we have we
reach 100,000 fans that's a hundred
thousand fans sure achievement okay okay
so Lana's take to achievement that's you
have to write all that crap for
achievement reach achievement Richard
told ya okay so that's it thank you for
creating the contents all the way along
along the way if I only imbue you have
reached ten hundred thousand followers
right because the way it works in
Chinese is it's yeah ten thousands right
is that right yes ten this another word
for ten thousand so bad but ten ten
thousand yes
in dozens yeah okay this is 100,000 yeah
every day right this is the so this is
something that were for you is that
milestone is that big milestone yeah my
stone really happy to see you your your
your project have been recognized by a
lot of followers okay cool
a lot of them have become your silicon
friends in your in the online world
silicon France in significant
significant friends yeah okay meanwhile
I probably couldn't communicate with a
single one of them if I met them on the
street but yeah that's the beauty of all
mine right yeah are people watching this
cool eighty point oh wow so the no
pressure witness but like your
translation okay I know I'm released
yeah multiple ten thousands of people oh
my god okay okay this look like an
English English test for me
initially this is me in real-time it
just okay cuz you know I can replace you
with Google okay because our because of
your consistent hard work hard work yes
how work and never like with never
giving things are you have create your
own little world on buoys at the
meantime this is jinx yes is she to
chant and you know that actually doesn't
help me very much
okay the Chinese is very different than
my Chinese it's a great thing the great
thing about this is I actually know how
hard it is to translate in real time I
attended a like some kind of like
learning professional development
something thing with my mom back when
she was a teacher and she's hard of
hearing and has trouble with conventions
and like presentations in particular
because the audio solution means that a
lot of the time the synchronization
between the lips and the audio is not
quite perfect so I had to sit up at the
front and translate to sign language
what they were saying and I am like
barely functional like Khan I was at my
best I was barely conversational fluent
in in sign language and like at the end
of those two days each day I just would
go back to the hotel room just lie down
and sleep
absolutely one of the most mentally
fatiguing things you can do like there's
a reason that by law translators have to
be swapped out every I forget how often
it is but it's like shockingly fast
because the the tax it is on your brain
is like it's really different from
almost any other kind of work so I'm I'm
giving them a really hard time but it's
actually doing a great job okay so
there's no saying you're a very powerful
creator in this area a lot of new new
users coming to sure share your content
okay because they love your not your
artwork and create a new world and okay
okay so right
yeah as people well if there was exit
I'd be able to find that too because
it's on that exit
yeah we believe that you have your
passion to constant them consistently
putting out your hard word to what you
love is a is a treasure in your life I
hope you can maintain your passion in
Billy Billy and create unlimited
possibilities so that's it that's our
letter from the Billy Billy
CEO now what's this ma'am I don't know I
can't read a signature in Chinese I
can't return English there's no there's
no I yeah there's no that printed just
yeah so okay yeah you do the owners
Dennis this wouldn't happen without you
it's really cool I don't think it could
be more Asian if they tried yeah
adorable it's a TV
it's so cute on TV I know what rabbit
ears on a thing means it is let's have a
look at it Wow look at that
oh you can they have signed it - yeah I
have like a stand here and you can put
it this - sure that's pretty cool you
can also hang it on the wall it has a
couple of like nail hooks on the back
it's velvet on the back your favorite oh
yeah you can touch it so you can just
take this off with the four screws and
then you can hang it on the wall like
that this is acrylic actually that's an
interesting pretty good so you can see
like they have a lot of comments here
okay are those comments like from our
channel you think no I think they just
it just for this plate okay I don't
really understand some of them okay but
yeah some of them like this like Oh
absent is 3000 times is like not
original I'd like to do is not very
original no I'm probably asking you're
turning off with three dots in time okay
up something something Jay call I don't
really know I don't really understand
what about this one with Billy Billy and
this Cheers
Billy Billy this is like a face emoji
yeah I know I know the face this isn't
some things are universal this is what
this is a some keep give you my knees
like T monitor that means like now we're
gonna be demonetized
on YouTube and Billy Billy we
is this give up my niece's so that means
I give you my niece that means like okay
I'm like kneeling down for you
oh okay so it means like it's like
that's warmer it's like it's like a text
bout yeah uh pow pow okay oh no power
like this like New York not like no down
now powers like that no that's like I
don't understand what you're doing oh my
knees for you is that what it says yes
yes your knees for you yeah actually
that's what it means yes but not like
what you're thinking but I'm thinking I
would never regret that join Billy Bowie
desire yes so um so yeah they've gone
like a very shadowbox kind of looking
style kind of like the old YouTube one
it's quite a bit bigger which I actually
like because I've always felt like that
the silver play baton was like kind of a
saving on shipping cosplay but I mean I
guess YouTube had to kind of see it
coming that they were gonna ship
literally hundreds of thousands of these
things at some point so you gotta kind
of control you control the
ridiculousness of your spend there
honestly I really the one thing that
really stands out to me about it
compared to the YouTube one actually
either the YouTube ones is that instead
of just going with a cheap like screen
printing finish both on the glass of the
original one and on the metal top or on
the metal front of the of the new one
they've actually got like a textured
like it's it's an etched kind of
embossed font here and then there's
actually a like a shiny silver ink
that's uh that's filled in on the Linus
tech tips what does this actually say
congratulation you have reached 100,000
followers fans okay and then on their
logo as well like the thing actually
looks really sharp and even up here you
can tell that what they've done is this
is like a
translucent MACT peace and then they've
like itched away a top layer like it's a
really cool kind of printing that it
looks like they've done on here I wonder
if you could even back light this thing
that's why I'm thinking I thought you
don't like it no I think you could cuz
look if you look through the hole here
it's a little bit trouble you said why
don't you put it behind the slate oh
that little M yeah oh here here is
that's here yeah yeah if you take this
thing so we would have to take it apart
we'd have to put some kind of diffusion
layer and then we just have to put some
kind of lighting in there we could
totally backlight it you can also G a
bit well yeah obviously I thought that
without the same 1000 percent RGB okay
so so yeah oh so come on in and let's
let's kind of talk about what happened
so I had said but this is something that
wouldn't have happened without Dennis
and as much as the title of this video
made it sound like we just bought like a
like a Chinese clone of a YouTube play
button as you guys might have picked up
on at some point here either if you've
heard of Billy Billy before or you went
in googled it or just from our tone this
is a real video platform that we
actually do upload our videos to and we
actually did just reach a hundred
thousand subscribers and for us this is
kind of a big deal because this is on a
Chinese language video platform that
without the hard work of our translation
team yeah coordinate yeah huge shout out
we have like a team of 54 people that
day yeah I do a contract but they but
they do a lot of how work like a lot of
videos that we don't have script and
like vlog like 20 minutes they have to
like work on it and get it released we
after that wearisome focus trying to
sing that with YouTube but a lot of
videos are really hard to translate but
they did a fantastic
job so good job our team and yeah and
right now this is 100 right now we have
400,000 oh really subscribers are we
actually growing pretty fast right now
let me see I actually stole numbers oh
that's kind of crazy so we have four
hundred and nine thousand like fans
followers and we have we have over 60
millions play that's not bad actually
that's pretty cool I don't pay that
close attention to it so like I said
this really wouldn't happen without
Dennis's hardwork coordinating it and
without the translation team we do
obviously like pay money so I guess I
can tribute that to it and it's all the
original LTTE videos but I guess this
raises the question why do people need
to watch on Billy Billy comm instead of
just watching on YouTube we have Chinese
subtitles because this platform you also
has different kind of function that
YouTube doesn't have you can comment on
the timecode that so the common good pop
on the screen that people they trans
people usually do that absolutely that's
kind of cool you can turn it on and off
right yeah the comments floating by on
the screen but then what will happen is
if someone comments on a particular part
of the video then at that moment in the
video the comments will scroll by on the
screen so it's kind of like a highly
engaging way to to do to leave comments
so there could be like no comments for a
while and then like a really funny
moment happens and it's like wow that's
like what everyone else thought about it
which is kind of kind of cool kind of
interactive
also that because I was subtitle who
burned into the video so that we can
change the fonts easier to read on
subtitles okay yeah yeah that's
basically it and of course the elephant
in the room yeah that there's no access
to YouTube in China yeah so right now
because of the the complicated nature of
getting money out of the People's
Republic of China
wait the PRC that's like mainland China
right people Republic of China is that
right yeah yes okay okay so because of
the complicated nature of that even
though Billy Billy actually does have
an Adsense like program we can't be
eligible for it because the money would
have to go to someone who actually lives
in China which creates a bunch of
Taxation complications for them because
they would then have to forward it to us
but like how like it's it's really
complicated and there would be no way
for us to claim ownership of it so if we
just set it up so it went to someone
then they could just take it not not
that we don't trust like the members of
our translation team it's just that
that's it's not that's not a good way of
doing business so we don't actually make
any money on it at all but this was just
a decision that we made like a couple
years ago I think 2016 2016 just to hey
we need to have some kind of a presence
in China people in China like if they
want to watch Linus tech tips they needs
time away not just on this platform we
also have our China on egg fun you can
you can you can no two doors Costco to
dal we killed yeah yeah this is the one
that honestly has been the most success
this this one's the biggest one like in
China online video is really different
in China like a lot of those bigger
sites it's not so much indie creators
like like us like we'd be considered
indie it's more like like like actual
shows and stuff that people are just
watching online and even Billy Billy the
foot there's a funny story behind the
start of what we were doing there so
Billy Billy was more like a pirate site
so actually the reason it was brought to
our attention was that the translation
group some of the early members were
pirating our videos translating them for
nothing just out of passion for
technology and wanting to share our
videos with people in China and
uploading them to Billy Billy and we
were like yo WTF you actually can't do
that and they were like oh sorry we just
wanted to help and we were like oh okay
so now we actually contract yeah to do
it officially so so that was that was
really cool that's something we started
working on a couple years ago and this
is just it's an exciting milestone it's
something that a lot of thought a lot of
you probably didn't know that Dennis
died was here yes I do think this on
camera like personality where it's like
Oh Dennis he's just he's just stupid and
he doesn't know what he's doing and he
trips on things are like whatever I do
but this actually does a lot of stuff
here so he's our primary editor for fast
as possible he actually edits a lot of
tech linked now like 95% though yeah he
does he coordinates the Chinese
translation team he does shooting for us
so sometimes if we have to go somewhere
particularly Chinese speaking I will
prefer to take Dennis with me because
you know when we did for example the the
gaming high school yeah and Taiwan
Dennis arranged all of that like
start-to-finish contacted the the people
there arranged the shoot day shot it
edited it did the thumbnail for I didn't
think the thumbnail was great anyway
the gaming hotel did really well that
was another Dennis initiative so yeah
here's a little award maybe we should
argue be back light it and put it up in
like the gaming lounge or some yeah cuz
honestly okay you're gonna have to let
us know in the comments guys I think it
looks better than either of the YouTube
ones it has so much more character like
this feels so sterile to me and this one
has always looked kind of small and
cheap to me whereas this like really it
feels ok don't break it oh that's
already dead yeah so don't you don't
have to be on its grave sure should we
should we do a couple Super chats or
something I actually don't even have my
laptop here to talk with you guys have
people been super chatting yet okay oh
sorry you guys I don't even I don't even
think there's a way for me to access
them on mobile there's so many things on
YouTube that are just like YouTube's
amazing the technology that they have
for vaad online is I don't know if
anyone will ever catch them but there's
stuff that's just like kind of basic
that I don't have like four stories for
example there's I have no stats for the
whatsoever I have no analytics for them
I can't access them in the in the
creator studio app or anything like that
like it's just there it's just not in
here yeah I could I could go over there
and read a couple or like I thought I
had my laptop over here David you want
to just follow us over here like now
look Dennis does lighting - yeah a plus
ten out of ten lighting okay so it's not
entirely an on camera like I mean
there's an element of Dennis being kind
of a klutz sometimes okay so what have
we got
Ivan tek-tips is king now apparently
Dennis needs a weekly live show
nice Dennis isn't fired Dennis was never
no we've never even joked about known as
being fired you're thinking of Colton
yeah can you quit it with the artsy
aspect ratios on your videos 18 by 9 is
probably here to stay I don't know if
you are familiar with this but tech
linked is still sixteen by nine right
yeah and if that this still sixteen by
nine okay but LTT is probably gonna stay
18 by 9 a lot of our viewership is
mobile you guys and mobile phones are
moving to that wider aspect ratio
personally I'd really like to see TVs
available in a wider aspect ratio I've
pitched my case to the TV manufacturers
that I sort of have the ear and we'll
see what happens but especially with how
many movies are shot in a wider aspect
ratio I think that's an obvious next
step Hank says here's five-year host for
super fun Oh get your own car painted
your car's kind of a piece of junk to my
car
that's fine where's my Civic too but
it's what your doesn't eight yeah looks
like it has a lot of rust on it no it's
okay it runs yeah Selenia says finally
off work in time for an ltte stream yeah
we were late today that's why that
happened i kevin says if you still have
the old Civic I'll buy it from you I do
endurance racing for beaters okay that
might actually be fun I think we have a
plan for it we were gonna run over it
with a tank but then that died so maybe
we're doing something else I don't know
we'll see um maybe we got here my
company has been trying to get a hold of
you guys respond sir
Watson can't get a reply well you kind
of sponsored us now
thanks for the 20 British pounds that's
cool
if you didn't get a reply from the email
that's listed on our channel they're
supposed to reply to everyone but if
they're not interested sometimes they
forget so that might be what happened
with the sales team total gamer says
Linus you and your crew deserve a coffee
break open your wallet and help them out
hey look I paid them every class they
buy is opening my wallet I'm just saying
not that that's you know the beyond and
they'll actually we even have free
coffee in the kitchen yeah yeah and we I
already pay more your coffee Andrew says
come join floatplane showers or birds
means cheeky lines that's a weird
comment I don't understand your comment
Beautif your life Linus says Jule Spice
Girls no no I'm gonna see the Backstreet
Boys although I would totally go see the
Spice Girls if they came to town that
that would be a thing okay they seem to
be a repeat dennis is the coffee break
guy just sending us like I love you too
nice to just over and over and over
again
no I yeah I think so we're what the heck
a couple gamer maybe is maximum yo what
was the thing you used before Flo
playing oh this is chicken nugget style
I almost wore my vessel shirt today but
then I didn't it was called vessel it's
demo why are you guys charging so much
for shipping from the LTTE story that's
because shipping from Canada is actually
really expensive especially tracked
shipping we are working on a solution
but it will take time I think that
especially people who live in Hong Kong
or the UK sort of take for granted that
you can have cheap worldwide shipping
with a tracking number for like a few
bucks that is not a thing here Canada
Post is not subsidized in any way so
it's just really really expensive like
you have to pay for the fraction of a
plane ticket that your package would
have taken up the seat of like it's
ridiculous so that is our cost um Justin
says when was your love of computers
born
I don't know around the same time I was
magnet says I want the new t-shirt
design as a sticker that's probably
worth investigating but we're working on
boxers first do you believe someone said
be replete Cheers Oh Peter Phu alright
so that's it guys thanks for tuning in
to the stream thanks Dennis for helping
me co-host yay oh and thanks to our
sponsor pulse way who's talking points I
have on my phone over there ha ha yay
you're tethered you're tethered David be
careful Paul's way is a remote
management system for servers computers
really any machine you have it's
compatible with Windows Mac Linux and
applications and we use it for all kinds
of cool stuff for example I get a pulse
Li notification any time one of our
servers goes over a threshold that I set
for a disk space so that I can
screenshot it and forward it to Ed and
be like hey yo why haven't you why
haven't you moved some videos over to
the vault
you can monitor yeah I know the vaults
broken right now we're working on it
anyway
so that's why you haven't heard from me
about it lately ok it's not that it's
not bull our servers are all fall it's
bad it's a bad scene
they're both all full and awful for
those of you who misheard me the first
time anyway so you can use it to monitor
all kinds of aspects of system health
you can set up all kinds of great like
