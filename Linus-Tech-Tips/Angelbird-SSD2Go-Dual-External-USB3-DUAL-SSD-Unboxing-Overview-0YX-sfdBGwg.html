Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
Haswell system for unbelievable overall
performance welcome to an a very excited
unboxing of the angel bird SSD to go now
I can pretty much guarantee you that
you've never heard of this product
because I've never heard of it and Wow
okay maybe you've heard of it but I've
never heard of it it is an external SSD
solution so external storage solution
that it's mult spent a long time since
I've encountered an external storage
solution that's really taken me aback
and kind of Goa'uld Linus know there's
something you haven't seen yet so inside
the box I find I don't I don't know if
actual retail units come with all this
but I've got a couple of different USB 3
cables well you'll notice that's unique
about these right off the hop is that
they're a 2a cables so okay you can
already tell there's probably something
a little bit different about this drive
there's also two more of them so these
are white and I guess possibly different
lengths I have I have no idea apparently
yep these are these are longer cables
alright so the SSD to go has a very very
unique design this is the twin well why
don't we start with sort of common
features so it has a sand force based
SSD storage solution okay so stand for
space SSD that's cool next up it has a
built in for second ups so what that
means is in the event of some kind of
power loss or other sort of catastrophic
failure the built in UPS will allow it
to flush the cache that's one of the
reasons they used sands force controller
base drives inside here because if you
had a controller that used a very large
cache then what would happen is in the
event of a power loss there might not be
time to flush the data from the cache to
the drive itself and that might result
in some data loss and holy crap this is
one of those products where you hold it
and you go yeah that feels like quality
each SSD to go is crafted out of a
single block of the highest quality
aluminum according to angel burden I
mean
to agree with them at this point because
it is absolutely fantastic and the twin
model you can get them in a variety of
colors I actually requested that the
twin that I got be purple and black so
it's in a you know combined sort of
color combo that looks really really
cool and what you'll notice okay so
right so the UPS all that good stuff
sorry about that I was actually just too
awed by the manufacturing quality
designed and manufactured in Austria so
this means that I'm now officially a
fanboy of at least two companies that
are based in Austria the other being
knock Tula which as you guys know make
my favorite fans ever it's okay so one
of the other advantages of the design
that they've gone with here with the
aluminum housing is that it keeps the
drive nice and cool so angel birds
quoting anywhere from a 32 degree to 40
degree operating temperature meaning
that you can use this thing anywhere
that you can take it and based on how
its built I think you can take it pretty
much anywhere remember guys that the
things that cause flash cells to degrade
our rights so they have a fixed number
of rights that they can handle as well
as temperatures high operating
temperatures will make your SSDs degrade
faster over time so the regular ngon
twin drive is just one of these and the
twin as you can well imagine is a
twinned version of it now the first
thing you're gonna notice about it is
what in the heck Linus it has two
interfaces the reason for that and the
reason that I requested this drive
specifically is because for my needs
this is perfect you can get it with any
number of different capacities so 120
240 or 480 gig individual or dual drives
and what I'm gonna be using it for is
safe rugged durable redundant storage
we're going to Computex and we're gonna
need to store a lot of data that I don't
want to keep on a hard drive inside a
computer because I don't trust them at
all and I want to be nice and fast for
external transfers which is where this
comes in but I don't want to risk a bar
losing it I don't want to risk any kind
of a data loss that's caused by a drop
or a fall so that's where SSD comes in
and finally because these are fully
redundant they have their own individual
data sources they have
own individual power supplies completely
their own dedicated circuitry I don't
even have to worry about one of them
just sort of outright dying randomly I
will still have all of my data so I'm
going for a redundant storage solution
where I can just plug them in the other
cool thing is that because USB 3 is
going to be pretty much tapped out by
the there we go by the transfer speeds
of ass and force based SSD what's cool
about having two separate interfaces to
it is that you can actually take
advantage of the full transfer speeds to
both of the individual drives assuming
that you've got full five gigabit per
second from two different ports on your
board which is possible because many
boards have multiple USB 3 chips that's
built into them now another use case
scenario for this is if you wanted to
use it as like a boot drive and a data
storage drive so they've heard of cust
our angel bird has had customers
ordering these with like a 120 gig drive
in one side and a 480 on the other side
so they can actually run their OS off of
it and then run their run their programs
or run their storage or mass storage or
whatever else off of a separate one I
think the real story with this is just
the overall fit and finish of it I mean
it's I've never seen an external drive
quite like this the anodization is
immaculate Wow very beautiful I think
that pretty much wraps it up I will be
giving you guys a full impression of
what it's like to use the SST to go once
we get back from Computex so do stay
tuned for that but I can already tell
you I'm pretty stoked on this don't
forget to subscribe climas tech tips for
more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and I think something
like this wouldn't be complete without
my trademark phone comparison so there
it is next to an HTC one and as you'll
be able to see very shortly once I get
the nod from ng that we've got a good
shot of that is that it is significantly
thicker than the HTC one so maybe not
really intended to be kept in your
pocket unless you want people asking you
how happy you are to see them but
something that you could easily keep in
a bag</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
