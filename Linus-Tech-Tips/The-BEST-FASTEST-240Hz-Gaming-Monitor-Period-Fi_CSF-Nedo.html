they bring to the figurative table here
faster processing times so that's the
speed at which it can take that signal
that comes in from your video card to
draw a new frame and turn that into
something that the panel can understand
and faster pixel response times so
that's the time that it takes an
individual pixel to go okay you're
supposed to change to this color and
then actually flip to a different color
so that the image changes but until a
couple of years ago all gaming monitors
were still held back by one key factor
the refresh rate and in fact many gaming
monitors today including this one are
still running at 60 refreshes per second
or 60 Hertz meaning that some of the
information on the screen can be up to
16 milliseconds old depending on when
the video card out put it the PG 258 cue
kicks all of that in the teeth boasting
the highest true refresh rate of any
gaming display on the market 240 Hertz
bringing that maximum delay from refresh
rate down to about 4 milliseconds so
let's check it out then shall we
you
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and

bear for free check out the link in the
video description now to be clear there
have been displays in the past that have
advertised 240 Hertz for 80 Hertz or
even nine hundred and sixty Hertz
refresh rates but those have been
different typically this has been found
on television where what they're
actually doing is taking a regular old
60 Hertz signal and processing it to
approximate what the frames in between
would be every TV manufacturer has a
different name for it but that
technology is totally unsuitable for
gaming for a number of reasons the main
one being that it adds a ton of
additional processing time where on a TV
it doesn't really matter but in a game
where the user is actually interacting
with what they see on the screen it's a
totally different ballgame so for this
to happen on a gaming monitor there are
a couple of key advancements that had to
be made number one we needed faster
processors for our displays because 240
Hertz you know 40 milliseconds later
with a bunch of you know guesses as to
what might have been in between is not
the same as real time you know
sub-millisecond processing of frames
streaming over from a graphics card and
number two is that we needed a better
display interface so DisplayPort 1.2
saves the day again it's capable of
carrying 4k 60 Hertz which if you you
know do some fairly simple math is four
times the number of pixels as 1920 by
1080 or 1080p which is what this display
does so it stands to reason then that
you would also be able to do four times
the refresh rate at this resolution
number three is we needed faster panels
so it wasn't until now that we would
even be able to get any
benefit out of 240 refreshes per second
because if the pixel response times
weren't good enough then sure you might
be pushing out 240 images per second but
you'd end up with a big ugly blurry mess
instead of a clean crisp image okay so
we managed to cover the refresh rate and
the resolution so far but let's talk
about the rest of the monitor first up
is the base this is going to be a loved
it or hated thing it's got kind of this
black and sort of rust orange kind of
thing going on and then they include a
couple different ones of these little
ROG illumination logo doodads here that
you can swap out if you want so they
include two ROG ones and then they also
include a few blanks so you can
customize it if you want or you can turn
the light off entirely in the on-screen
display next up is i/o now originally
g-sync monitors did I mention this is G
synced by the way so that's that's cool
if you're into the whole variable
refresh rate technology things only had
DisplayPort in now we get DisplayPort
and HDMI although it should be noted
this was interesting the HDMI port only
operated at 64 Hertz when I tried it so
I'm not sure what the deal with that is
because that's not even the best that
you could normally do on an HDMI 1.4
connection also down here is a USB hub
power in and a headphone pass-through as
well as a little doodad here for cable
management and then the whole thing goes
through this guy right here you've got
all the normal adjustments so you can go
portrait you can twist you can go up and
down and you can tilt like that you take
these ugly stickers off it as well and
getting down to the panel itself what
has become an rog staple these super
thin bezels on the right and left as
well as the top making it ideal for our
surround gaming setup if you're into
that sort of thing I personally am NOT
and as for the panel itself you can use
this handy test image that I got over on
ABS forum to find out if it is true
eight bit or if it's six bit with
frc so that's a technique that
approximates shades that six bit panels
can't reproduce by reproducing nearby
ones and alternating them and it looks
like it does use FRC so that right side
has kind of a mottled appearance to it
so let's fire up a game then shall we so
at first and wasn't sold we went
straight to 240 Hertz and tried with do
you think and without do you think and
thought that maybe whether it's the
computer and the game engine struggling
to maintain steady 240 FPS or just the
the limitations of human perception it
seemed like it was just more numbers
more Hertz numbers for the sake of more
numbers without the obvious benefit that
going from 60 to 120 or 144 herds had
but obviously based on some of the shots
being made it wasn't hurting matters
either then we decided to try out the UL
mb mode which necessitated a switch to a
hundred and forty-four Hertz Max and
something wasn't quite right he was
complaining about not having audio and
complaining about this and complaining
about why shots are being made but but
those slick shots they were happening
before so back to 240 Hertz we went
there back it looks like just like the
SSD upgrade of half a decade ago it's
one of those things where it might be a
little hard to tell the difference until
you've had it and had it yanked away so
that leads pretty well into the
conclusion for this display here I did
run it through my usual range of color
tests and as I would expect from someone
who cares about attention to detail like
asus in srgb mode is actually not bad
consistently Delta ease of less than
five across the board is it suitable for
content creation no but we're we really
expecting that out of a TN monitor not
really overall pretty good but on to the
gaming argument it's like a five hundred
dollar monitor for someone like me what
I say it's were
if it no I'm not going to get the most
out of a piece of machinery like this
but for someone who actually has more
skill do I think that 240 Hertz
technology is the way forward for
competitive gaming absolutely do you
remember the last time you called your
cell phone carrier and someone just like
picked up the line it was like hi can I
help you with something
of course you don't because that would
have been like before I even had a cell
phone
but that's not the case with ping at
ting you don't speak to a robot you get
put through directly to a person and
their pay structure is totally different
to you pay only for what you use with
the average King bill being only 23
bucks a month per device if you're stuck
in a contract and you switch kitang
they'll cover 25% of your cancellation
fee up to $75 and they've got new lower
mobile data rates across the board just
$10 per gig beyond the first gig so head
over to Linus king.com
and try out their savings calculator you
enter in your last few bills how much
you you how much you paid for and it
spits out an answer as to whether or not
you will save by switching to ting and
when you sign up at our link you'll get
25 bucks in service credit or towards a
new device so thanks for watching guys
