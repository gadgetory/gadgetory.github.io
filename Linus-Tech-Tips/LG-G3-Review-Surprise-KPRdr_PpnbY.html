phones I've reviewed so it's actually my
first experience with their particular
flavor of Android it's got the usual
top-of-the-range spec Snapdragon 801
quad-core three gigs around on my Korean
model well this is unusual actually a
5.5 inch display with a 2560 by 1440 16
by 9 aspect ratio LCD display that is a
stunning 530 plus pixels per inch with
its factory tuning and data center DNA
and Intel 730 series SSD is an amazing
choice for gamers and performance
enthusiasts physically the phone floats
my boat mostly the top features an IR
blaster and a noise cancelling
microphone port the bottom has a micro
USB charging port the main microphone
and a three-and-a-half millimeter jack
and here on the sides we have well
actually not a whole lot of anything
I've been asking someone on the Android
side to create a phone without side
buttons that are positioned such that I
constantly mash them by accident for a
while and I guess LG's solution is to
completely remove them like the g2 the
g3 s buttons are on the back and this
ergonomic shift while a little jarring
at first was something that I actually
got used to fairly quickly and if it
enables thinner bezels then I like the
decision the buttons back here are a
lock button and volume up and down that
you can use to quick launch the camera
or q memo if you long press them also on
the back we find the laser distance
finder for the camera the 13 megapixel
camera itself a two-tone flash and a
speaker port with one watt amplified
speaker something like that anyway that
might have impressed me if it was
mounted on the front of the phone it's
loud enough but nothing can sound quite
right pointed away from your ears this
seems like as good a time as any to
mention that I think LG nailed it with
the backing material on the phone though
it looks great it's lighter it's more
difficult to stain and it can be removed
and replaced
unlike most metal designs on top of that
the phone is still very solidly built it
doesn't it doesn't feel like a
compromised brushed plastic photo in
mang under it there's a user replaceable
3000 milliamp hour battery whose
performance I can't really comment on
because my crew
unit doesn't work for cellular data here
there's a SIM slot a microSD slot and
contacts for optional accessories like a
wireless charging compatible backplate
which brings us to the front of the
phone aside from an LG logo 2.1
megapixel selfie camera and a dimmer
than I would like
RGB LED indicator this is one clean
design the bezels are slim it's nearly
completely symmetrical with a very small
chin and it is very obvious that LG
wants the experience of using this phone
to be all about that 5.5 inch quad HD
IPS screen unfortunately the screen
didn't really float my boat it's got a
lot of pixels and I'm a major advocate
of pushing the envelope technologically
but there's much more to a great screen
than resolution the g3 screen has a warm
yellowish cast that I don't find
pleasing and a noticeably worse contrast
ratio than the One m8 that makes it less
pleasant to use than my current daily
driver especially outdoors now I've been
informed by others that to fully take
advantage of it I need high-res content
like 1440p wallpapers but I don't really
care about wallpapers and neither do a
lot of people so the only practical
benefit from me is that text is ever so
slightly sharper when it's extremely
small something that LG seemed to pretty
much design their stock keyboard to take
advantage of with its tiny symbol
indicators when it comes to moving
pictures though whether we're talking
about games or shows I can hardly tell
the difference between 720p and 1080p at
this screen size anyway so 1440p feels
unnecessary when other things could have
been improved about the screen instead
which leads us to the software we got
off to a rough start here prompting me
during setup to enter a backup contact
phone number that sits on my lock screen
is genius but the hard core EULA that I
had to sign made me super uncomfortable
and it's not all bad though LG skin has
an attractive flat appearance that
differs in subtle ways from stock
Android but didn't require a crazy
learning curve to get the hang of one
thing that impressed me was that it
offers a great degree of customize
ability for a stock skin you can change
the homescreen switching animations
change screen off fade-out effects you
can tailor make your own power saving
schemes adjust vibration strength choose
between a bajillion different unlock
methods my personal favorite of which is
not code where you just tap certain
parts of the screen and then finally and
this one's a killer you can customize
the functions and locations of the
bottom buttons and even choose whether
they are hidden or persistent it feels
like a great balance between a vanilla
interface and the tricked out ones that
Android geeks tend to use the included
keyboard is also surprisingly solid you
can tweak a couple of buttons and alter
the autocorrect aggressiveness and
backspacing once undoes autocorrect
SwiftKey are you listening but there are
still a few issues keeping me away like
lack of a customizable long pressed
duration being able to adjust the size
though is great especially with the very
small chin on the g3 it made more of a
difference than I expected to get it
tuned just right the settings menu where
all of these tweaks reside actually
annoyed me at first its inefficient use
of all that screen real estate even at
the smallest font size felt very
TouchWiz like but then I found out you
can switch to a completely different
view and listen on actually found in
quite efficient to navigate so thumbs up
there but not everything about the UI is
fast and whether it's the high
resolution or something else
multitasking is very noticeably slower
than the One m8 and it makes the device
feel considerably slower for me given
how often I switch between recent
windows I also really dislike the way it
puts your most recently used application
in the top left corner it should be the
opposite because the fastest part of a
smartphone screen to access for
right-handed users is the bottom right
it's not all bad though you can zoom in
and out unlike sense it allows more than
nine items and compared to stock Android
it's much faster to find things that are
buried deeper in the list other
complaint time now I guess LG health and
smart tips about using the phone are a
complete waste of an entire homescreen I
turned that off right away adding extra
stuff with overlapping functionality to
the Google now swipe up is a big no-no
and managing apps is really weird
instead of whole dragging to delete
within the app tray that does absolutely
nothing as far as I can tell
instead you go through the top right
menu where you can change icon size and
hide or uninstall apps from there but
there's more good stuff to dual window
seems crazy useful if you chat while
watching videos the multi item clipboard
is a freaking godsend if you do a lot of
copy pasting and replying to incoming
texts without having to minimize the
current app is a big time saver and the
enamine the stunning number of user
accessibility options makes sense look
stupid invert colors change colors for
higher contrast send a custom message
for hearing impaired users change
headphone output so that one side is
unbalanced for folks who hear better in
one ear flash alerts for hearing
impaired and I guess I guess easy home
is the kind of thing I would enable for
my grandpa if I thought you needed a
top-of-the-line phone in the first place
and I wanted to hide all the
functionality from him for some reason
ok that last one didn't make a ton of
sense but the other stuff is great on to
the camera the laser focus does seem to
deliver very fast auto focusing Auto HDR
actually was pretty pleasing to use for
me um and aside from the unlabeled
Settings button
I found the app quite easy and more
importantly fast to use dedicated photo
and video buttons without needing to
switch modes is great that's something
that drives me bananas about the m8 it
is so slow to switch modes and all of
the usual top-of-the-line nice-to-have
modes are here so you got the 13
megapixel still camera 4k video capture
and 120 FPS 720p but while it's cool
that the slo-mo on the camera record
sound
unfortunately the recording quality is
noticeably worse than the One m8 for
video
lots of jaggies it's not a huge issue
but one to be aware of if you love
taking slow-motion videos of your chats
are you gonna do are you gonna do a
vacuum detail which leads me to the
conclusion some overheating issues aside
I didn't encounter them here in the
great white north by the way but it's
fairly well documented on the web the g3
is a solid contender LG delivered a foam
that looks beautiful and feel solid but
still managed to deliver optional
wireless charging a microSD slot and a
high-capacity removable battery the
hardware spec is up there with other
flagship devices and even though I
probably
for a more vanilla Android experience
personally LG skin really does feel like
a solid middle ground between stock
Android and those tricked-out custom
launch or custom everything Android
setups that some people use all of that
said the g3 didn't quite win me over
it's not really LG's fault but in spite
of the very sexy very thin bezels the
phone is still a touch too wide for me
to use comfortably it's just too big for
me to handle if you know what I mean but
that doesn't mean it won't be perfect
for you and wouldn't you know it we've
got an opportunity for you to own your
very own to try it out and find out if
it's any good LG is giving us not one
not two not three not four not five but
twenty five LG g3 phones to give away to
our audience yes 25 now there are some
caveats
they are pre-production Korean units
which means that unless you're on AT&amp;amp;T
or in the US or a number of other
carriers worldwide you won't be able to
get certain aspects of the phone working
so maybe you won't get cellular data for
example and you'll only be able to use
it on Wi-Fi and to make phone calls
which is what I can do with mine on the
Bell Network but it's still an LG g3
it's still the real deal fully fledged
phone and you get to keep it
