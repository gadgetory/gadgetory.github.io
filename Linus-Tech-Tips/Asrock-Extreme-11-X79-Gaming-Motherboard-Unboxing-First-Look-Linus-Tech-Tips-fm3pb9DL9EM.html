the azrog x79 xtreme 11 motherboard this
is
pretty much as extreme as it gets I mean
they took the dial from 1 to 10 and
cranked it up to 11 so what's it got
going for it this I'm not that sold on I
don't think it has 5 times the system
speed with X fast Ram and I don't think
the USB is five times the speed of
anyone elses USB 3 although it is five
times the speed of USB 2 I don't believe
that their LAN is five times the speed
of anything it's gigabit which is either
10 times 10 100 or it's the same as
gigabit so but what it does have is
support for core i7 processors on the
LGA 2011 platform SLI and CrossFireX
compatibility Windows 7 or Windows 8
compatibility any new board is going to
be just fine with Windows 8 you've got
dual PCIe 3 PL X chips yes
it is that extreme so this board is
capable of running 4 Way SLI and
four-way cross fire at 16 x16 x16 x16
x-s you heard me correctly four PCIe 3
graphics cards at full 16 XP is that
crazy and because the board is all PCIe
16x connectors they can actually run at
sixteen eight eight eight eight eight
eight I mean if you were going to put
like six read cards in a video card in a
board this would be the line okay moving
right along to some other things before
I explain why the packaging is all beat
up 24 + 2 phase power design with no
coil line by the way I have already
fired up this board and put it under
load digital power ok 8 by ddr3 2500 +
OC although the forms indicate that it's
kind of hard to do that unless you have
like exactly the right cherry-pick
modules and really it comes down to the
CPU more than the board for things like
eight dim high-speed memory operation so
bear that in mind you got to have a good
memory controller on your cpu dual stack
MOSFETs this is a new thing here so the
silicon silicon die are you
increased by stacking two dyes into a
MOSFET very cool stuff eight SATA 3 /
SAS connectors from the LSI controller
and creative onboard sound with core 3d
audio with premium headset amplifier so
yes abs on board sound on board SAS with
an LSI control or not Marvel not JMicron
nothing like that
LSI like the real deal um yeah
dual PCIe three plx chips those are
expensive chips by the way there's no
other high-end board that uses more than
one of them and that's very high-end
under boards like this is this is in
terms of the actual cost to asrock
probably the most expensive possible way
to implement everything that they've
done here this is a premium board no
jokes
what else we got here premium gold caps
yeah they just blink they put gold on
the Cavs just because eight by usb3
forefront for back Scout mode here the
anima K sure let's move right on has
rock oMG online management guard ok
internet flash
oh cool searches for available UEFI
firmware updates from asrock servers
audio detect the latest bios from the
servers and flash them within the ufi
setup without entering the windows OS
that's cool easy raid installer
interactive UEFI with apparently music
ok yeah visual BIOS Broadcom dual land
ok that's unfortunate i would have liked
to see although it does support teaming
i would have liked to see intel lan
however it's got so many PCIe slots that
you can install of me sort of adding
cards as you want if you're going to
spend $600 on a motherboard I don't
think the land card is that much of a
stretch so you've got a front USB 3
three and a half inch adapter just in
case you don't have that built into your
case short hard PCB sli bridge another
one 3-way SLI bridge whoops oh wow ok
simplicity simplicity is like kind of my
favorite thing ever this is the best
3-way SLI bridge that I have ever seen
nothing no branding blank brandings here
which is good but that is going to look
so clean
in your system love it
6a 2 3 6 game a 4 second cables another
hard bridge again very clean nothing on
the front of it here you can take this
and install it in this and add
additional back panel USB free if you
don't want them in front handy 2 molex
to SATA power connectors random feeling
the power supply the SATA connectors on
it you're buying $600 board your
priorities are wrong
io shield color-coded for convenience
manual manual
ok you got to be kidding me ok software
setup guide this is a quick installation
guide download the latest drivers from
the ass rock website don't use this
that's a novel not a quick installation
guy that's a full manual guys now let's
have a look at the board and I will sort
of quickly explain why it looks like
this this is my cat I have already tried
this board I took it out so that I could
so I could test it for coil whine
because I'm looking for a new build for
my person our new board for my personal
rig and I was like super disappointed
when I came back in the room and he had
absolutely shredded the packaging for it
so hopefully that's not going to be a
problem for me at any point in time also
it was strapped in with these but I have
already undone them so it was zip tied
in so that it's going to be totally safe
and shipping I'm actually really
impressed with the way this board is
packaged no possibility for it to go
anywhere a nice soft foam and this is
the board so a few things that are
unique about this board the engineering
that goes into building something this
extreme should not be understated
because this is a standard ATX length
board it's an e ATX and then it's a
little bit longer but it's not fully to
e-atx either so as long as you've got a
decent case with a little bit of extra
width this board will fit eight dims 7
PCI slots cannot emphasize that enough
does not exist in a standard length
board other than this one no one else
was able to do it and the fact that they
had to put in do
plx chips to get so I mean no one else
even did 16 16 16 16 1 1 1 or anything
like that nobody did this and they had
to build in additional chips in order to
make it happen and they have 8 plus 6
hard drive connections so to say 2 3 6
gigabit per second ports off the Intel
chipset for say 2 to 3 gigabit per
second ports off the Intel chipset and 8
SAS 6 gigabit per second connections off
the LSI chip so these are mostly
intended for storage guys for your boot
drive you should still be using the
Intel controller alright post debug it
ok I'm getting distracted here because
I'm lit just on awestruck by the board
there's your 24 phase power up there you
can actually see 12 by 2 under this
under this heat sink right here and then
this is the one thing that I was not too
thrilled about with this particular
board the fact that it does include a
chipset fan however my understanding is
some water cooling company somewhere
might be working on a full board cooler
for this board which would make it
pretty much the perfect board for the
extreme user because there's no
electrical noise and once you get that
fan off it should be completely silent
with all of these connectivity options
built into it alright dual eight pin
power connectors in the top left and in
their ideal locations lots of room
around the CPU socket for you know large
coolers water blocks whatever else the
case may be 8 DIMM slots which is
unbelievable given that they've again
squeezed it into this tiny form factor
considering all like I mean look how
dense the PCB is like even the top
corner it's like yep put in everything
you possibly can
everywhere like here just do like a pen
of like here down to the bottom how much
stuff is on this board like a lot of the
time you look at premium products and
you're like yeah there's really not that
much stuff on it like what were they
spending money on and with this one
there is actually no doubt that they
spent a lot of money on it
ok 24-pin power connectors in this ideal
location along the right-hand edge 2 USB
3.0 front panel connectors they're not
right-angle but I'll forgive them again
their space constraint at some point I
guess on something like this chipset
cooler okay and for those of you who are
suggesting on my blog channel that I
just use a simple
chipset waterblock I can't do that
because there are four chips under there
see there's the screws plx plx one of
these is going to be Southbridge and
then one of them is going to be the LSI
controller this is probably the LSI
controller would be my guess hold on
where the trace is going now that might
be the so yeah that's the LSI controller
and that's the South Bridge as they used
to call them and they don't call them
anymore but I still do because I'm
old-school like that onboard power
connectors post header or post a readout
us print USB connectors auxilary power
is here and here so if you really did
want to install for graphics cards I'd
recommend using one or both of those to
avoid burning out your 24-pin connector
you've got onboard firewire onboard HD
audio there's your bigger cap for the
onboard audio a headphone amplifier C
badge one looks kind of neat but I think
the chips actually under there probably
shielded in some way you know okay um I
think that pretty much covers it other
than oh yeah it's got the sexiest color
scheme ever I wish it had a matte black
PCB but since the PCB again is like so
covered in stuff that you don't see it
anyway this would have been just perfect
for my build if I could get my hands on
or on a chipset cooler for it that's not
not a fan the fan actually doesn't turn
on until the chipset gets hot but the
dip chips that got hot pretty fast with
all those chips under it so not to
mention it's sharing cooling with this
guy right here via this heat pipe and
the power phases are bound to get pretty
toasty as well so let's have a look at
what we've got right right right right
hold on hold on fan fan connectors one
three pin one four pin one three pin one
three pin so that's a total of what
three three pins one for SK another for
pin another three pin decent number of
fan connectors not a ton long and back
panel connectors ps2 port yay
still a must in my opinion eight USB 2.0
ports clear CMOS dual Gigabit Ethernet
firewire four USB 3.0 ports dual eSATA
ports like overkill much so that gives
us a total of Moses six eight fourteen
sixteen sixteen SATA connections optical
audio out and 5.1 audio with a mic input
