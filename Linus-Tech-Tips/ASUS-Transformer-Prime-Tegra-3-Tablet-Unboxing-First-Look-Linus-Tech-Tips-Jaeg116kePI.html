first look this is the e Pad Transformer
crime and based on everything that I
already know about this tablet I am
extremely excited to have a look at it
so I've got a few other tablets here for
me with me for comparison so I've got
the ASA sense of these who says the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 I've got the
Asus Transformer original and then I've
also got an iPad 2 in its little snug
case there which I'll take off for a
closer comparison check this up so the
first thing I notice about the box is a
nice foamy insert which is gonna make
sure that that screen doesn't get
damaged in any way during transit very
very high hopes for this tablet so let's
check out the packaging here Rumbles
gonna help us so the first thing we find
here are some of the outstanding
benefits offered cool so incredibly slim
yes this is the slimmest tablet yet
ultra performance with the NVIDIA Tegra
3 quad core and that's a bit of a
misnomer because it actually has five
cores one of which is a low powered core
for when the tablet is not really doing
much silky smooth 3d gaming HD video
playing up to 1080p all on Google's use
there friendly and upgradable Android OS
it's funny they mentioned upgradable
because it will be compatible with Ice
Cream Sandwich moving forward although
it does come with honeycomb unrivaled
visual acuity so this super IPS plus
panel actually it is according to what
I've heard so far even better than what
was my previous favorite tablet panel
which was the one on the the PLS panel
on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 some very excited
to check that out supreme sound so as
soon as they've put in improved audio
performance okay
unlimited productivity with the yeah
with the dock which I'll be checking out
later so there's the transformer prime
dock just like the original transformer
you can add more battery life as well as
full QWERTY keypad and some additional
IO so that's pretty cool hey check this
out this doesn't come with like a cheesy
microfiber cloth
with an actual proper textured one
that's gonna like look at this I
actually like this number years back
this looks like almost exactly the same
as the one I bought way back when my
neighborhoods very similar this is
really really old and ratty and this one
to do so you can clean off your tablet
with that it also comes with what
appears to be the same charger that
comes with the original transformer so
actually I'll check it out what do we
got here yeah hey soos something or
other yep looks like the same thing and
as you can see it's a potent cat toy
which you shouldn't be playing with that
all right what else we got for
accessories I think that's pretty much
it so it's a fairly bear package you've
got your cleaning cloth you got your
little instructional doodad you got your
charger and you've got what is obviously
the most important piece the actual epad
transformer crime so let's check this
out first thing we want to do is take
off this plastic sheeting so this
already looks very familiar to me this
looks a lot like the Zen book which is
just a beautiful piece of computer
hardware so I love the finish here it's
got kind of a concentric circle thing
going on with like a brushed metal
finish nice shiny Asus logo right in the
middle there overall the machine is
quite light compared to the original
transformer that was one of the things
that made me sort of less of a fan of
the transformer because in spite of the
good form factor it really had some heft
to it this one is definitely
significantly lighter that's also one of
the things that I don't like that much
about the iPad 2 it's a very very heavy
device and for a tablet it becomes very
relevant if you're gonna be yeah it's
actually quite light I don't think it's
as light as the Galaxy Tab 10.1 hold on
wow this is really light even in spite
of the fact that it has feels a little
heavier I'll have to weigh them when I
do my proper follow-up on this on my
NCIX Khan channel but yeah it feels
quite quite light indeed very nice form
factor but yeah okay sorry what I was
saying so yeah when you're like you know
laying and dad watching movie or reading
a book or whatever the weight becomes
very very important so what else we got
on the back
here we have a flash and the 8 megapixel
camera and then you've got one speaker
on the transformer prime this feels like
a bit of a step backwards to me given
that the original transformer had two
speakers one on the right-hand side and
one on the left-hand side on the edges
there but you know what it doesn't
bother me that much when I'm using the
iPad 2 which only has one speaker as
well so I guess I'll let it slide this
time let's have a look at what we've got
for i/o on the device itself there's
your standard headphone jack up at the
top we find a whole lot of nothing
except a microphone we've got our on/off
standby button our rocker switch for
volume that looks hold on is that that
looks like micro HDMI but I could be
wrong give me a sec I'll double-check
that for you guys and then oh that could
be a microphone as well interesting okay
I don't know what that is either but
this is definitely a microSD slot which
is awesome because that in my mind
already makes the transformer prime
aside from the price point because yes
the transformer prime is more expensive
than the original transformer but
instead of starting at a 16 gig model at
399 it starts at a 32 gig model at $4.99
which is fine because the transformer
when it launched was $4.99 for the 32
impede model anyway so now we see a 32
gig model and a 64 instead of a 16 and a
32 so let's actually turn this baby on
oh yeah the dock down here at the bottom
sorry I wasn't quite done yet
what do these oh you know what these are
probably fir up yeah these are for
docking to the keyboard the keyboard
which actually acts not only as a
keyboard but an extended battery I think
I already mentioned that so there's our
serial number here's a little plastic
thing you don't have to leave that on we
can get rid of that if we want I would
probably not keep that on the device so
it's booting up right now so let's talk
a little bit about the Tegra 3 processor
oh yeah we've got our front webcam here
as well our front camera so take a three
processor so it's a quad-core CPU plus
Nvidia has also significantly upgraded
the GPU so it is substantially more
powerful than the Tegra 2 which was
pretty much the only processor that you
found in most of the first generation
and tablets with Android Honeycomb
right so I mentioned that it's quad-core
but there's a fifth course so your four
cores are going to turn on or turn off
or be clocked higher o'clock lower
depending on the profiles you set
depending on the load that you're
running and then there's an additional
one core that can run just as a super
low-power state and the all the other
four ones are off so that's why it's
actually a five core processor nvidia
has also significantly upgraded the GPU
horsepower so CPU is better and more
faster and there are more and the GPU is
much more powerful so okay one thing
that I've noticed right away about this
title that I'm just going to key in the
password to my my SSID here okay there
we go
one thing I've noticed about it right
away is I don't know if you can see this
in this light but I can see the
touchscreen interface a little bit I can
see the grid of dots it's not that
noticeable it only really you know what
it only really comes out if I catch the
light that's up there on the ceiling and
it shines directly off the tablet into
my eyes I can kind of see the dots
around it but it's definitely not as
noticeable as something like the
Motorola Xoom or the Toshiba Thrive both
of those have very very noticeable touch
screen overlays so this is sort of what
I would say is about middle of the road
in terms of the visibility of it I can't
see it a little bit so let's just get
that let's get this booted up I just
want to check out the overall
responsiveness of the unit so one of the
things that I've really heard said about
the transformer prime is that all of the
kind of nonsense slowness that's been
associated with Android tablets is
pretty much gone because here I mean
come on let's compare it to something
like an iPad 2 where the user interface
is so slick I mean look at that it just
kind of seamlessly goes from okay the
air video one is at the bottom left oh
boom now it's at the bottom right how
did that happen whoa holy cow so it's a
very very smooth user interface
experience and that's something that my
expectation is that yes
throwing more CPU and GPU horsepower at
the problem is a good way to address it
definitely looks better I mean look at
this you can see how quickly and how
smoothly it transitions now but Ice
Cream Sandwich is also supposed to
address that in a very very big way as
well so when you compare that to the
transformer so you see that leg you see
that their first generation try the
first generation Android tablets really
didn't feel up I mean I'd say the Galaxy
Tab 10.1 was probably the slickest
feeling out of all of them but they
didn't really quite have that same feel
as the Apple device and it looks like it
was a combination of hardware and
software so now we finally got the
hardware that's going to be a lot more
competitive with the processor in the
iPad 2 we've got a screen that looks
very very vibrant and let's actually go
ahead and look at that so they've really
increased the brightness of the screen
compared to the transformer looks like a
very very similar but slightly different
sort of take on the desktop wallpaper
that we were using on the original yeah
so brightness is way up hard to evaluate
color is based on sort of my initial
impressions here they have made some
significant changes to the menu right
here though so we've got a bunch of
different stuff including your eco mode
so turning on power saving mode turning
on balance mode turning on normal speed
mode you can lock your orientation or
not lock your orientation look how
quickly the responses on this though
compared to previous Android tablets
we're navigating through menus really
feels like a bit of a chore Wi-Fi on
Wi-Fi off let's see how quickly it
connect to my can connect to my Wi-Fi my
browser working yet that's nice that's
one of the things that I really like
about the iPad 2 is that when you are in
range of your wireless it's like boom
it's on it's on so let's go and see I
XCOM see how quickly that loads up I'm
sitting right next to my hotspot so this
should be pretty much a best-case
scenario I'm on a broadband 50 so that's
a 50 megabit per second internet fine go
to the forum let's read the forum's very
very nice to look at overall though I
mean look at the okay I apologize
because you guys aren't really going to
be able to see this but the contrast
between this black and this white
is just outstanding like this looks like
the deepest of deep blacks it almost
looks like part of the frame more than
it looks like part of the screen that is
just amazing so far I'm very impressed
with the screen though scrolling is nice
and quick let's see zooming because
that's one of the things that I really
felt was totally not the best experience
with the the first generation of Android
tablets so oh there's no internet
connection let's get that address okay
just a sec I'll be back guys okay so
here's the transformer I've got the same
page loaded so zooming in actually feels
a little bit better than it used to
there was a recent system update I
wonder if that kind of addressed some of
my concerns but it's still not quite
there with something like the iPad 2
which just feels so silky smooth when
you're zooming around let me look at
that okay so we're not quite there but
that's more of like a software thing
that hopefully will be addressed with
Ice Cream Sandwich let's wrap this up
and we have just like a general physical
comparison now I just love this thing
physically actually like I love it
physically no no I don't mean it's a
machine it's just it's taboo still you
know give it another couple hundred
years and maybe we'll be having a
different conversation so let's look at
the yeah let's look at the overall
format compared to V and iPad 2 so I'm
just gonna lay this down on top of it so
the iPad 2 is still not a 16 by 10
screen which is horrible and needs to
just die in a fire
hopefully that's something Apple will
address with their next tablet so you
can see we do have a significantly more
wide screen screen which is great for
watching your media content whether it's
on YouTube or whether it's over network
or you put your media files on here onto
micro SD which iPad 2 doesn't have very
frustrating because I do like the iPad
whole let's talk about the glass right
Gorilla Glass
so as some of you know I recently broke
my iPad - so my screen is cracked all
the way from here to here and then all
the way from here over to here it's
pretty pretty wrecked which has made me
fairly unhappy so this uses Corning ware
Gorilla Glass which should make it about
as scratch proof and break proof and
everything proof as possible so that's
that's something to bear in mind guys
that
actually there's a great demo that a
soos has on YouTube of the original
transformer where they take keys and
objects and try to scratch the glass and
then they show you the results at the
end so that's that's outstanding and
that's something if you've ever had a
tablet that's broken then okay it might
be a factor for you so let's have a look
at the format compared to the original
transformer which is pretty darn similar
look at that they've reduced the width a
little bit which is really nice although
it is a little bit more okay so let's
call this the one we call this the link
so it's a little bit shorter lengthwise
but it's a little bit wider okay
however the screen size is pretty much
the same so what they've done is they've
lost some of this bezel space around
here and then they've increased a little
bit of the bezel space around the top
let's check out the thickness so
thickness was one of the ones one of the
things where the original transformer
really didn't stack up well against his
comp so yeah the original transformer
really didn't stack up that well
thickness wise you can see compared to
the ipad 2 against the original
transformer and then these there's a
transformer prime against the original
transformer so I'm gonna go ahead and
put the ipad 2 next to the transformer
prime so you can see the thick that's
really really close okay so a su says
it's the thinnest I guess I'll have to
take their word for it but these all
look really really close to me so here's
the ipad2 transformer prime and Galaxy
Tab 10.1 so yes this was HDMI over here
so that's micro HDMI so what asus has
done here is they've receipt they've
produced a trap tablet that this was my
favorite android Tegra 2 tablet the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 no secret I love the
screen love the form factor love the
weight however no microSD no HDMI output
done like you lose the benefit of going
with the Google platform in my in my
personal opinion by removing those
features because that's a huge selling
point for me versus something like an
iPad 2 where you have to have like a
weird dongle to do HDMI output or you
get a USB port or whatever the case may
be
so the transformer prime takes that form
factor fits in a micro HDMI fits in a
micro SD slot and is still
very very lightweight great looking
screen so far but I'm going to spend
some more time with it hopefully in the
next little bit great piece of glass and
I think we've pretty much got a winner
here folks so thanks for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the
transformer prime don't forget to
