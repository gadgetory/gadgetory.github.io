are you doing today it has been a long
journey I hope you're well but we
finally made it it's a great day today
it's been a very frustrating hour and a
half or so basically the computer I
streamed from right before the LAN show
that some of you may or may not have
watched me it's kind of been a while
everyone who watched that stream is
probably in bed by now yeah so the
computer that I streamed that stream
from decided to it yeah does not it
boots into Windows sometimes and then
when it does it locks up within about
two minutes so there you there you have
it yes I know the cameras a little green
yeah I don't know with it I don't know
what to tell you guys about low audio
because I just listened to it so there's
that but there you have it we are
finally here we are finally here and
apparently Luke looks terrible damn dude
sorry sorry sorry dude sorry to hear
it's Ari to hear that Luke loose at
Luke's had kind of a rough spell here
you know damn dude
looka fatter as for it being so quiet
I'm literally listening to the stream
right now so it's fine alright so guys
let's get right into it we've got not
off not a lot of time here based on the
time it happens to be right now
so topics Pokemon go is obviously the
worldwide poo storm that is taking the
nation in the world it's swept pretty
much everything tops daily twitter users
and sees more engagement than facebook
something that not many apps can boast
and we've got a lot of news around
pokemon go it's gonna be actually some
pretty fun conversation the csgo
gambling debacle continues valve has
issued a statement so we'll get into
that and sort of what that means in a
little bit here it is customary for the
co-hosts to do two of the call-out
topics he's knew that this don't worry
folks PC shipments in the US are growing
for the first time in quote-unquote ages
it's only been a few years but it's
still been quite a long time and then
also Nintendo is releasing a miniature
Ness with 30 built-in games so that
could be cool that actually sounds
freaking awesome let's roll the intro go
away go away Colton go away go away at
least I'm hoping the intro will roll at
some point here yep you should go do the
thing so Colton doesn't have sure it
sure is supposed to I will I will
seriously
ah so I am not sure if we are oh oh oh
we are we are we are we are broadcasting
a thing I owe I pulled the network
versions that's why it didn't work so
the intro will not be occurring today
and Nick will jump into our first
Pokemon go topic while I change my shirt
does that mean that this monster stuff
isn't on there okay okay anyway so as
Linus alluded to earlier Pokemon go has
topped Twitter daily users and sees more
engagement than Facebook currently so
it's not the biggest mobile game in US
history approximately five point nine
two percent of the u.s. Android
population engages with the app on a
daily basis which is insane that's the
highest percentage of daily users on
Android or sorry the highest percentage
of daily users on Android is in
Australia at about seven point nine
eight percent of all Android users in
the country and like is it even
officially launched in Australia maybe
people in the chat can tell me but I
don't think it is I could be wrong
though and then the current peak daily
active users is just over 20 million
people candy crush saga reached
approximately 20 million back in 23
there twenty thirteen so remember how
big the scope of that was it's even
bigger than candy crush and then clash
Royale only reached about 6 million at
its peak in 2016 so it's closing in on
snapchat on Android right now which is
pretty insane and professional yeah look
at you huh and apparently the Pokemon go
Android application could even pass at
Google Maps on Android in terms of daily
users like what what yeah so more people
are trying to find a map to where to
find little monsters than people who are
trying to find them at to get to there
to actually do something productive yes
I'm gonna move the mic right next to you
ok and so so on Monday the average
iPhone users spent 33 minutes in Pokemon
go
the average iPhone user yeah the America
in America Wow yeah and that beats
Facebook which saw about 22 minutes and
eight seconds on average I mean to be
clear Facebook has probably more staying
power than Pokemon go yes I mean don't
quote me on that maybe Pokemon go will
be the new social media app and it will
completely overtake everything ever and
replace YouTube and Facebook and Twitter
and snapchat and Instagram all at the
same time but probably not so this is
very much a hype train at the moment and
I don't expect them to be able to
sustain these kinds of numbers over the
long term like someone like Facebook has
managed to do but still it's incredibly
impressive I mean when you consider that
the average iPhone user spent half an
hour in Pokemon go that means for every
like old person like me who didn't play
it at all so this is us statistics from
yeah that's fine so for every old person
like me who didn't play it at all that
day someone played for an entire hour
like if you look at pretty much anyone
who does vlog style content on YouTube
right now like they're just walking
around being like everyone here is
playing Pokemon literally and I'm sure
that it's more prevalent in the really
concentrated areas like LA in New York
where a lot of these guys reside I mean
I've seen a lot of people going oh can
only get like 4 Pokemon in my area which
is in like Montana or whatever but I
mean just the sheer number of people who
are engaging with the app on a daily
basis is ridiculous
absolutely ridiculous the original
article here was from TechCrunch go
ahead and pull that up yeah
absolutely love it you know what's kind
of sad is I've been so busy this last
week I have not only not played pokemon
go I haven't seen anyone play pokemon go
right i I haven't installed it yet I
pretty much haven't been outside of work
or my house yeah in this last week or so
it's been it's been a sort of a
challenging challenging period here it
looks very fun though
yep so I guess yeah that's that's great
oh actually here's not a few more
numbers as far as the installs go so
Pokemon go
Android installs and daily active users
so in New Zealand 60 New Zealand and
Australia love their pokemon go that is
absolutely fantastic between 6.6 to
almost 8% daily active users and about
15 to 16 percent of people have it
installed pretty incredible so let's
talk about some of the worst news with
respect to pokemon go this article is
from tweak town let's go ahead and pull
this up San Diego residents brush with
death while playing pokemon go fall off
cliff Wow
they were both taken to trauma centers
suffering moderate injuries according to
battalion chief Robbie Ford of the I'm
not even gonna try and pronounce that
local fire department presumably where
they were playing the game in sonatas
sure let's go with that so one of them
fell somewhere between 75 and a hundred
feet and the other one approximately 50
feet and was found unconscious by
firefighters holy crap the dude who fell
a less or a lower distance was the one
who was knocked unconscious so like he
should be darn happy that his friend
like fell a little better and was able
to go yo dude we just fell off a cliff
playing Pokemon please come save us
ridiculous unbelievable and then there
was also a teen hit by a car while
playing Pokemon and go
so the original article here is from
Gamestop excuse me GameSpot that's
completely different things actually
even though it's just a couple letters
moved around shifted yeah so 15 year old
female from Pennsylvania was hit by a
car and hospitalized for injury injuries
to her collarbone and foot in addition
to numerous cuts and bruises her mother
says I blame the game because she would
not have been out of my house my
daughter is a hermit so that's that I
would like to clarify what a hermit
actually is before we actually go any
further with this story well like a
hermit used to be someone who lived on
like a royal property
but like never or something uh oh no I
had not heard of that I thought Hermits
lived in seclusion maybe like away from
other people so you can't live in
seclusion in your parents house yeah
I'm just I'm gonna look it up because
you got me doubting myself a person
living in solitude as a religious
discipline so yeah yeah so so your
daughter wasn't a hermit for one thing
just to be very clear about that and for
number two you cannot blame an app on a
phone for your daughter leaving the
house for your daughter
walking across a major highway yeah she
says at five o'clock in the evening
which is rush hour fantastic
what else we got here the US Holocaust
Museum asks players to stay away so
somehow US Holocaust Museum has been
designated as a polka stop so that's
developers slightly overlooking
something there I would say the
communications director for the museum
has said that they're trying to get the
museum removed from the game and that
playing the game inside a memorial to
victims of Nazism is extremely
inappropriate which I would agree with a
Dutch hospital has also asked that
players refrain from entering the bill
their building with the sole purpose of
playing Pokemon go after some players
ventured into restricted areas and they
posted a cute little picture through
Twitter there where they said there's
indeed a sick Pokemon at AMC but we'll
have but we look after him well please
don't visit him and it's like a Pikachu
with little band-aids and stuff you want
to show that yeah I will it takes a
second sure yeah but like oh I mean it's
one of those things where it's like I
know that in Skyrim it is considered
acceptable to just walk into anyone's
house or any building just pick stuff
just start like bashing things with a
sword to open them up you know like that
this is this is the typical RPG player
behavior yeah but that don't mean away
from the light Oh
all right this is the typical RPG player
behavior but while we are looking for
Pokemon in augmented reality we're not
supposed to be just like behaving as
though we're looking for Pokemon in okay
so we are supposed to be behaving that
way but we're supposed to remember that
we are also operating from within the
real world and that is that is not that
is not considered be the most most
appropriate waited yes well you get the
point I hope hopefully yes so here's the
I don't know I don't know what he needs
the tissues for but you know oh right
he's got a cold that's right little
Pikachu that's not that's the AMC
Twitter post which is extremely cute I'm
glad they at least had a sense of humor
about it yeah but like that's serious
apparently people were going into their
basement where there's like where they
essentially sterilize like bedsheets and
stuff like holy crap you're exposing
yourself to like serious possible like
pathogen armful pathogens and tainted
bodily fluids and just I understand that
it's Pokemon and that you're stoked to
go catch pokemon but like have some
sense please please in a little bit more
positive news there was a long aunt Long
Island pizza place who has their sales
who has had their sales increased by 75%
by using Pokemon go lures yeah this is a
huge thing so Luke and I were actually
talking about this earlier this week and
it is I don't know if this is confirmed
at this point it was a speculated thing
earlier in the week when we were
discussing it but apparently I want to
say bread garden had made it a chain
wide procedure nice to constantly spam
lures at their locations in order to
draw in people who were playing Pokemon
and go and this has become and that this
is this is amazing to me because it's
almost like like something I've talked
about before on the show
just in general is how computers had
this progression that they follow to
where they were kind of slow and not
really useful and only like nerds use
them and then over time they got more
accessible they got less expensive they
got more powerful they got more
functional and this happened over a span
of here you can scoot your industry to
this happened over a span of of decades
in the case of computers right and
phones have gone through it's just this
accelerated version of that right we're
the first smart phones were kind of like
stupid and quite frankly didn't do much
I mean people forget this but the iPhone
couldn't copy/paste I think come on it
couldn't copy paste and that was only
what like ten years ago nine years ago I
don't even know if that was ten years
ago was like 2008 or something yeah so
like eight years ago maybe yeah so so
that was not a long time ago and now
they've gotten to the point where I feel
like a lot of phone reviewers are just
kind of bored of phones because it's
sort of the same thing year to year the
cameras a little better but like it was
already pretty good yeah okay so I'm
taking that whole thing where computers
and phones have gone through this these
this this much accelerated progression
through the stages of of just for nerds
then exciting to everyone that kind of
got boring right so it feels like as a
mobile app Pokemon go is going through
an accelerated version of previous
social applications where it's like you
know Facebook was just used on on a call
it honor single college campus and then
multiple college campuses and then all
of a sudden it went massively mainstream
and now your grandma's on it okay but
that took a long time and what also took
a long time was advertisers figuring out
how to leverage the platform and ruin it
for the users right okay so all these
platforms YouTube Facebook Twitter they
start out free and then there's ads and
then there's sponsored tweets and then
there's you know companies trying to
spend
lots of money on attempted viral videos
or whatever the case may be it goes it
goes commercial yeah Pokemon go took
like two days to go from free sort of
micro transaction but but free fun app
to businesses figuring out how to cash
in on it and spamming lures in front of
their stores in order to get you to buy
more pizza which leads us finally let's
be fair there though because I actually
don't have that big of a problem with
this because they're not saying oh yeah
we have a lure in here you can only come
in if you're buying pizza as far as I
know no well they're just providing a
safe place for people to congregate
where you can also enjoy some food and
drink if you so choose yes and I
actually prefer this because like
they're placing lures here whereas other
people are placing lures in the middle
of parks in the middle of the night and
holding people up at gunpoint yeah okay
I'm not saying it's wrong right I'm just
saying that by the same logic um you
know we're just putting the land show
here and we're just saying you know hey
lynda.com you know hey it's a thing and
you can you can sign up for you cannot
sign up for I'm just saying like that
that commercialization the advertisers
taking over and figuring out how to
leverage the platform happened so fast
we have to remember though that it's
very similar to ingress true so a lot of
this stuff did develop over time in
ingress but the impact was much lower
the impact was much lower because
ingress wasn't this phenomenon but I
mean it's you know what you're saying is
true but there are a lot of other
factors I think all right so let's see
there's not much left so the Lindsay
mini Zeo whatever
pizza bar in Long Island New York
started using the in-game lures as of
Monday July 11th it was reported that
Pokemon go had 7.5 what I think some of
the notes got mixed up okay anyway there
this is Wow
neon tech has confirmed that retail
establishments will be able to pay to
have their shop become a sponsored
location that hosts rare Pokemon
attractive items or a gym so this is
where we start getting into issues and
this leads into
next topic this is happening this is
happening so unbelievably fast the
Pokemon go partnership with McDonald's
is on source says according to Gizmodo
source everyone is using the same like
to stock images of particles it doesn't
matter you can use any Pokemon girl you
want completely doesn't matter at all
the like alright let's get into the
details here what do you got okay so
redditors discovered decompiled code in
android and iOS versions of Pokemon go
earlier this week and part of that code
indicated a potential sponsorship deal
with McDonald's apparently so as Linus
said a well-placed source has confirmed
with Gizmodo that the sponsorship is
moving forward and is set to launch in
one country in Asia and Gizmodo learned
that every McDonald's restaurant in this
country will either be a polka stop or a
gym they're unable to confirm which
country it would debut at but the guess
based on several compelling reasons
including that this country is the
birthplace of the Pokemon company is
that it will be Japan which makes a lot
of sense and this could actually be the
reason why the launch has been delayed
in Japan because apparently there are a
number of very upset people in Japan
about the fact that it hasn't been
released yet there for seemingly no
reason this might be the reason maybe
they said hey roll it out in u.s. see
how it goes if it's as crazy you guys as
you guys expect it's gonna be then you
know we'll pony up the money to have
McDonald's everywhere in Japan beep oka
stops and gyms and will launch there
which like I don't know I find this
whole thing a little ironic that it's a
partnership with McDonald's because
Pokemon go is all about like hey get up
and go outside walk around and be
healthy and eat McDonald's so that's a
little weird but I mean I guess it makes
sense in a way again it's positive in
the sense that they're providing
locations for people to congregate that
aren't some bush in a park at 3 a.m.
where some dude is going
try to rob you but I don't know I just
what are your feelings on honestly I am
trying to put the lower third on here
right now technical difficult ahnold's
partnership with pokemon go possibly
launching in Japan yeah I don't mind it
at all oh I I don't I don't mind okay so
there's a couple things that I do mind
about it so I don't mind people having
like you said a safe place to go to play
right - to congregate to do this
somewhere that's well-lit somewhere that
you know there's staff around with a
phone to call 9-1-1 or whatever it's
attack yeah emergency number happens to
be um I don't even mind that you can go
there to get some rare pokémon like you
know ham burglar to or whatever the case
may be like I don't mind that but what
does bother me about it a little bit is
that to say that McDonald's restaurants
will be the place to go to obtain a rare
Pokemon implies that you won't be able
to get it anywhere else right so those
rare Pokemon that you could otherwise
get some other way are going to be
limited to McDonald's so if you're
creating something special something
different the the Ronald McDonald blacks
or you know whatever actually that's
that's that's what they should just call
McDonald's in general no and the
McDonald's never sponsor okay so wasn't
great if you're creating new content
around it and I can be a purist like a
Pokemon purist who doesn't care about
the mix squirtle
the Burger King you got your backs note
saying where I don't care about the mix
squirtle then I can still be a
completionist when it comes to the
actual Pokemon and the actual
achievements and whatever else is part
of the main game but if you're gonna go
okay yeah if you want you know you have
to buy five happy meals to get them you
to oh then then it gets then it's pretty
frustrating to me and that's something
that I'm not
someone says mix squirtle leaked yeah
well it's kind of where I was going with
that like that brings up an interesting
point though because I think they're
only I think Pokemon go currently like I
said I haven't played it yet
I don't know entirely what it's all
about I think they don't either have gen
1 or Gen 1 and Gen two Pokemon I think
it's just general in Pokemon but there's
like hundreds now yep so maybe they're
going like hey sport check if you want
you know the legendary is from gen 3 to
be sport check exclusives like pay us
money like that's I agree I don't
necessarily like that and you know what
there's ways that they can be smart
about this as well like for example
timed exclusives are a lot more
palatable to me than forever exclusives
yeah so if you are rolling out new
Pokemon very slowly and you kind of go
okay if you want to be the first place
where you can get one of those then the
obsessives who absolutely have to have
again like like a gen 3 legendary or
something like that
fine they should just go to McDonald's
and buy a Big Mac I don't care but the
people who can wait a couple of weeks if
they can still get one in a legitimate
manner then that's super cool i I don't
mind that at all
yep for sure and I'd like to be clear I
don't think there has been any
confirmation of like this Pokemon will
be specific to this retail location or
anything yet right but we're just saying
that it would be concerned
if that did happen yeah oh man like
there's some like there's some pretty
there's actually some kind of some kind
of scary stuff in there like for example
what if in Manhattan McDonald set it up
so that you had to visit like every
McDonald's in Manhattan to go that would
be very troubling should we do the chat
app one yeah sure let's do it okay so
apparently Jonathan Zara was a beta
tester in the summer for Pokemon go he
can see that it offered users no way to
chat with one another so he was like hey
I should probably create something
around that and he said that especially
in a location-based game of course there
should be a chat so you can text your
buddy and be like yo dude here's where
I'm at just how to eradicate it's dope
so within five days of the launch of
Pokemon go Zara's free app for Pokemon
go chat is approaching 1 million users
and hitting servers with 600 requests
per second and apparently now it may
drive him bankrupt because the server
costs are getting like ridiculously high
you know the guys that I'll give him
I'll give him credit for sticking to his
principles here so this is the original
article here's from the verge com I'll
give him credit for sticking to his
principles so he says he doesn't want to
add support it because he hates ads and
doesn't want to draw attention from the
Pokemon company and I'm like okay cuz
you don't make sense the definition of
selling out is compromising your
principles for money that's the
definition so if you love ads and you
think ads are great and you have no
problem with ads personally and you kind
of go okay well you know so there you go
I consume ads therefore I will also
serve ads and people can consume them
and add to make the world go around and
this is great then there's nothing wrong
with having ads in your application or
your content or whatever else the case
may be but if you you hate ads you
adamantly refuse to use products and
service
is that are supported by ads and you
just kind of relate no nope I do not
agree with this I refuse to take part in
this then I gotta give him credit for
sticking with his principles and not
implementing ads with that said if you
have a super successful app and you are
providing a service that people are
willing to either endure ads or pay for
it is not very business smart to be
spending your own money maintaining it
when you have a community of literally a
million people that wants to use it yeah
and like the the pay for the app thing
is what he wants to avoid in order to
not attract attention from the Pokemon
company because like that would probably
result him in a lot of trouble but like
if you're doing responsible advertising
that's not like taking over the screen
or like playing music at a ridiculously
high volume like weird like Pokemon porn
or something like if you're not
infringing on Nintendo or nyan takes
intellectual property in any way and
even like have a disclaimer to be like
hey Pokemon company if you see this like
I only have ads on here so that I don't
go broke any profit that I'm making is
going to X charity or whatever and then
they can still slam in with a cease and
desist that can still happen and they
can still shut down his app but at the
end of the day at least then he hasn't
paid out of pocket for it something that
doesn't make it sound of sense I don't
know I mean yeah like good on him for
seeing an issue and like doing something
to correct it but holy crap man
everyone's like stop the Pokemon stop
the Pope there's nothing we can do to
stop the Pokemon yeah I did I'm
personally not playing it I'm doing
everything that I possibly I'm not
letting my kids play it and I'm not
playing it I've done everything I can to
stop Pokemon like my kids don't even
know Pokemon is I didn't have to stop
them but yeah they know what paw Patrol
is it's a new generation hat so 20 20
years from about 25 years from now my
son's generation
is gonna be like some some like
augmented reality paw Patrol thing Oh
paw
yeah it's hot paw Patrol it's awful it's
the very worst problem I do not know I'm
speaking of things that I endorse in any
way shape or form first up is lynda.com
being a little slow we're running the
show off of my laptop today which is
super not ideal I threw all the drivers
together on there and yes great it's
great yeah sorry what's great running
the land show-off melanda comm it's used
by millions of people around the world
because it's great be your first time
reading Lynda talking points yeah I mean
well I've read them personally in the
past considering I talked to them but ok
fine I'll do it there are more than 3000
courses available on lynda.com I'll do
it I'll do it I'll do it you're awful ok
lynda.com is used by millions of people
around the world with more than three
thousand courses available ah that's
what he just did I didn't even do it
better what's great about lynda.com is
that it's not just for professionals or
it's not just for casual users there are
a wide variety of people who can benefit
from Unicom are you bored at your job
are you looking to take things to the
next level are you bored with your hobby
are you looking to take things to the
next level are you bored with your life
I'm looking to take things to the next
level are you bored with Pokemon go and
looking to take things to the next level
courses but what they do have is
business courses they've got creative
courses like photography or video
editing or Photoshop they've even got
development courses so if you wanted to
say for example I don't know write a
cool app that you and your friends could
use to chat in Pokemon go hey it's a
starting point it's somewhere to work on
in a foundation that you can build on
through self-study and it's extremely
affordable lynda.com plans started only
25 bucks a month and you can try it with
a 10 day free trial by visiting
lynda.com so right there and start
learning today our second sponsor that's
pretty good when you don't like screw up
the whole time
eight points i never screw up the
talking points I always get the talking
points at which Chet knows what I'm
talking which chat knows what I'm
talking about I never get it wrong
so our second sponsor today is actually
a new one
it's called Ministry of supply and this
is I this is Colton's doing that we are
wearing collared professional shirts on
the winch I'll just give a disclaimer
this shirt is actually a size too small
for me because it was ordered for Luke
so it's not like the shirts fit poorly
this is just a shirt that's too small
for me yeah feels nice we ordered it for
we ordered it for Luke because Colton
way to go Colton apparently didn't
realize that Luke wasn't going to be
here this week so Luke's actually on
vacation which is like amazing I don't
think that's ever happened I am I
okay yes it has but there's always kind
of been a reason for it right like he's
gone on vacation at the end of a
business travel to a location so like
where he's in Germany anyway right yo
I'm gonna take a couple couple more days
off I'll be back like a little bit later
peace bro like that's happened yeah but
he actually booked time and booked his
own plane ticket yeah I think that's the
first thing I ever paid for a plane
ticket yeah anyway and he's visiting
someone incoming okay I need to tell the
people of a minute yeah yeah ministry of
supplies the ministry of supply combines
performance fabrics advanced
manufacturing techniques on tailored
design to make wear to work clothes that
are comfortable and capable yes my
friends your clothing can do this and
more it's funny these talking points are
great way to go coulton clothes are
meant to be worn on the body
I'm glad we're clearing this up for you
people so Ministry of supply starts by
studying ergonomics how to buy human
body moves and functions to ensure
they're putting the right technology in
the right place which is why you won't
find a jock strap over top of your
nipple the products keep you cool and
dry with sweat wicking fibers breathable
fabrics and nasa-developed phase change
materials which help regulate your body
temperature so basically you won't get
too hot and sweaty and
you will still be clothed which is good
I mean Denis should probably look into
this for those of you who don't know
Denis I just like can't keep a shirt on
I'll walk into the he's like what's that
actor that has this issue forget who it
is it's either like Matthew McConaughey
or Ashton Kutcher I'm just gonna google
it cuz it's like 10 actors who can't
keep their shirts on come on no freakin
way the first one is Dennis I didn't
even know that that counts Hugh Jackman
okay so Hugh Jackman Mark Wahlberg okay
Mark Wahlberg I also knew it's gonna
make me it's gonna make me load a new
page in order to keep reading the
article so nope not gonna do that but
yes there you go so Dennis Dennis is one
of those maybe ministry supply could get
him taken care of and everything's easy
to care for no dry-cleaning no iron oh
yeah
this is right out of the box and it
doesn't have that and you like threw it
around and it's like super not lined and
actually pretty wrinkle free that's
awesome I actually did not I was I was
actually gonna yell at Colton about this
too and then I just didn't have time
because I was busy fixing the show I was
gonna be like yo you just brought me a
button-up shirt right out of the box
right out of the full pre-folded package
and you didn't even I'm gonna have lines
like this oh man that's pretty cool
that's awesome so there's no risk to try
and returns with a 100 day hassle-free
return policy so just check it out at
bitly slash that and save 15% off your
first purchase and I've got a note about
it being the perfect gift for Father's
Day but Father's Day was actually a
while ago again
way to go Colton maybe if your father
has a birthday in the summer it's the
perfect gift for that yeah that's right
oh we love Colton so no seriously
Colton's in the chat saying give me a
break why come on
oh okay actually there's a bunch of
notes in here so they've got their
Gemini button-down shirt the Apollo
dress shirt at Apollo polo a v8 or two
pants and Atlas stress socks which are
all featured and we'll have linked in
the in the wine show description on
Youtube upload check him out whoo all
right let's move into some non Pokemon
topics here I'm sure that we have some
right oh yes okay yeah here we go
so the original article here is from
Jones Ward dot-com and this is a pretty
this is a pretty serious pretty serious
whole sort of topic here the other
original article is from the steam store
so there's an in-game trading update
from valve so they've acknowledged that
there are a number of gambling sites
that have started leveraging the steam
trading system great job being on top of
that guys it's been a problem for a
while didn't really take a long time and
they claimed that there have been some
false assumptions made about their
involvement with you with those sites
they wanted to clarify they have no
business relationships with any of the
sites they have never directly received
any revenue from them and steam does not
have a system for turning in-game items
into real-world currency so okay
technically all of those statements are
correct they claim that the sites have
been using the open ID API in a way that
is not allowed by their user agreements
and they are going to start sending
notices to these sites requesting they
cease operations through Steam and they
will further pursue the matter as
necessary and what they also had to say
this is from the article is that users
should probably consider this
information as they manage their in-game
inventory and their trade activity so
basically don't fear items now I tried
to find the link for this I was looking
at the global Offensive reddit yesterday
and there were claims that some of these
illicit gambling sites had actually
disabled their trade BOTS so like people
had like thousands of dollars worth of
inventory and they just couldn't get it
now there's some speculation that the
sites are just updating their Terms of
Service and updating their use of the
API to abide by Valve's clarified rules
but it is unclear exactly how they will
do so bottom line here is that Valve
seems to finally be taking a stand
against unregulated gambling using their
in-game
items long overdue but I mean you can't
it's like it's like if your kids not
doing their homework for a week and
they're way behind and then like they do
it all finally you don't yell at them
for doing it so I don't want to be
overly critical but this really is
overdue to be clear this is very much an
emerging story so as new information
becomes available some of it may become
outdated and will require further
updates as time goes on there's a group
of trial attorneys that's taking on
class action requests in the CS go
gambling lawsuit or in a CS go gambling
lawsuit so they've stated they're
pursuing multiple class-action lawsuits
in the u.s. against valve and various
skins gambling websites connected to the
game Counter Strike global Offensive
working diligently to recover funds from
US residents who have lost money on
skins through these illegal gambling
contracts call 1-800 recover your skins
for help now it really does feel like a
late-night lawyer infomercial it feels
like those billboards that are all over
the place in later yeah exactly exactly
yeah watch that show yet is it good
I saw the first season on Netflix I
thought it was very good cool okay I
can't remember his name
but the diet the guy who plays Saul is a
great actor I'm a fan what's his name
yeah weak link Larry so Henry Winkler is
that right no no I one other thing that
isn't in the doc but that I noticed
twitch Odenkirk hung and I guess they
look somewhat similar not really not
that similar no not something anyway the
Fonz
okay just forget it I'm pulling I'm
having a Luke moment here that's as bad
as some of the stuff it's been a week
let's just let's just say it's been a
week okay you know we carry on anyway on
it's none of the doctor but twitch
actually issued a statement that said
that any you know in their terms of
services it essentially says that if a
streamer is streaming something that
breaks the terms of service for of a
third party then
is not allowed on Twitch so they've
essentially came out and said you guys
can't stream gambling sites anymore you
guys can't take sponsorships from
gambling sites anymore Wow
I'm sure that they have been wanting to
do this for a while I remember it was a
couple months ago it was getting super
out of hand the csgo twitch page was
always just like gamble gamble gamble
gamble gamble for like the top 10
streamers and they said something like
you can only gamble on stream for 30
minutes a day or something like that but
it was so tough to enforce so I think
they were just waiting on valve to
finally make a statement on it and now
they've come on they said yeah okay this
is out of hand you guys need to stop
doing this so I mean I don't know I like
like I said valve is technically correct
and everything they've said but I think
that they're like trying to obscure the
truth a bit because you can be darn sure
that betting on csgo matches has
increased viewership like I would
personally say that I believe that
happened you could also say that losing
while betting on csgo decreased
viewership so I'm not gonna try and say
that there's a correlation or uh yeah
but I don't know it's it's just such a
nasty subject in my opinion all right
let's move on to another kind of nasty
subject but it turns out they got it
sorted out the original article here is
from Tom's Hardware nvidia gtx 1080 and
1070 DisplayPort incompatible with the
HTC vive this is something I actually
could have discovered on my own and been
very very frustrated by if I had
upgraded my media center PC so I
actually use the vibe in my living room
because my computer room doesn't have
enough room for hollow point anyway um
so what this means you're such a nerd I
know what this means is that if you have
a display plugged in via HDMI already
like say for example a TV most of which
do not have DisplayPort inputs if any
and you want to use DisplayPort into the
mini DisplayPort in in the little the
little input/output box the 10 17 1080
just wouldn't work with
it yeah not my 980 worked just fine but
it was apparently a bug they have
identified a solution and we'll be
rolling it out in the next driver update
which is this week the articles from the
11th they rolled out a driver update
today so it probably wouldn't be a
ridiculous assumption to say that that's
probably it but I'm looking at this
going like that is such a huge oversight
I would imagine people having their
display plugged in via HDMI and wanting
to use display port for the vibe being a
pretty common thing I mean I can't be
the only one installing this somewhere I
mean display for it hasn't even been
mainstream on monitors for longer than a
couple of years
I mean Asus kind of addressed that with
the Strix where they put two HDMI Xin
yeah so if you want to learn more about
this tricks we have a video coming to
YouTube next week uh yeah I think so
just went to vessel last night so if you
have vessel you can check that in um in
other news PC shipments return to growth
in the u.s. Wow
glorious pcmasterrace am i right no no
I'm not right unfortunately the news
isn't all good and while PC shipments
are up I think it what is it this
quarter yeah they're still down overall
for the year and the growth is not is
not huge they're up they might be up for
the year in the US only but globally
they're still down between four and a
half and 5.2 percent and even then we're
talking like 1.4 percent if you don't
factor in Chromebooks yeah and we're
talking four point nine percent if you
factor in Chromebooks we're talking
literally like hundred-dollar computers
so that's growth so that's that's unit
count growth to be fair yeah I believe
that these numbers only factor like
prebuilt PC sales yep so that's been on
the decline for a long time as more and
more people realize that building a PC
isn't as hard as the ones thought it was
or is some people once thought it was
right
speaking of PC building not be that hard
Terry Crews pretty much took over our PC
master-race yesterday because he's
building a custom PC and I got to say
like I'm
huge Terry Crews fan that dudes awesome
Brooklyn nine-nine is like one of my
favorite shows right now so I was pretty
happy when I saw this and there are a
lot of memes going down some dank memes
going on with with the glorious Terry
Crews putting the pcmasterrace hair on
him with his majestic figure and so he
was you know he created a facebook video
outlining the parts in his PC which now
has over 1.2 million views pretty darn
significant he was very humble
throughout the whole process asking the
community for advice and checking what
the community thought of his parts
choices which overall were pretty
positive he chose a core i7 6800 k 2
terabyte SSD 32 gigs of dominator plant
Platinum's from corsair and a gtx 1080
so pretty bad essrig and also he paid
for all those parts himself he wanted to
make it very clear he wasn't doing like
a sponsored deal or anything with intel
or nvidia or whoever and he says that
he's building the gaming ring to spend
more time with his son who is a big pc
gamer but he admits that he's also got a
fast growing interest in pc gaming so he
actually was part of the battlefield 1
pre e3 event with like Jamie Foxx and
Snoop Dogg I think that was the one
where there was a lot of let's say fog
in the booth of all the people there
that may have been that one Snoop was
there so yeah you don't really have to
say any more than that yeah and he
essentially said he really enjoyed
playing battlefield 1 there he's hooked
on gaming and you know he's made it very
clear that he's not gonna be abandoning
being this crazy like muscular huge dude
he's still gonna be a very physical guy
but he wants PC gaming to be a bigger
part of his life now which is uh pretty
dope yeah that's cool pretty sweet I
mean if he gets into VR especially some
of the more physical games yeah he had
an HTC vive very nice pretty cool I
would love to see like Terry Crews do
some live streams and I think he's
already been on some twitch ads so like
twitch get it going get it poppin this
looks pretty cool original article hears
from techradar.com
I mean this has been the the emulators
argument for so long look Nintendo if
you're gonna tell
we're not allowed to emulate then give
us a means to legitimately acquire the
gains and they've addressed this
somewhat through retro console games but
it's it's not always that well done this
actually looks like a fantastic solution
check this out
the nest is back it's a little mini nest
it's the same shape but there's no
cartridge to install it or anything like
that it's a much smaller size and it
comes pre-loaded with 50 games 30 30
games I say 50 sorry 30 games it has an
HDMI output so you'll actually be able
to use it without buying yourself like
what's that retro bit retro gen whatever
that thing that Luke just bought that's
super it's a low latency analog to HDMI
converter okay I'm gonna I'm gonna go
grab it off of his desk while you've run
through some of some of the details here
but a native HDMI output is awesome
because you don't need any specialized
hardware in order to avoid the horrible
processing latency that you'll encounter
by trying to put a low definition signal
into a modern TV but the we are it will
be available on November 11th of this
year for $59.99 USD so like essentially
the price of a new Wii U game which is
freaking fantastic and there are
actually some awesome and really classic
games that are gonna be a part of this
so Donkey Kong Final Fantasy the first
one Super Mario Bros 1 I've never played
three I think I started on two as well
the quest was the first one so I've
played mystic quest because it was
called Final Fantasy mystic quest but
it's not actually a Final Fantasy game
oh it was like rebranded for North
America or something was one of those
situations I don't remember the details
interesting it'll also have the Legend
of Zelda the very first one as well as
the second one which is not as great of
an experience well known I've heard it
says it's a bit of a subpar experience
you know but yeah like this is awesome
like I will play the crap out of that
yeah
like what is it 60 bucks yes 60 bucks 60
the price of a new Wii U game you can
get 30 classic Ness games that is
awesome
HDMI Nintendo this is the right way to
do it I like it I mean okay
not to be clear I don't necessarily
think that you should have to buy a
piece of hardware for this I mean if
they had okay I personally like it
what if they offered this what if they
also for 60 bucks had like a package on
Wii U's yeah like I'd like to see that
as well I think people would rate I
think people would complain because they
would think that 60 bucks is too high
and then I'm wondering like I wonder why
they're choosing to do it this way maybe
it's just like hey have this cool
knick-knack as well as all these games
and like I personally like having
Hardware stuff like I when I used to buy
more PC games I used to like to buy the
physical copies yeah because I like
actually having like a library of games
instead of just like oh yeah my Steam is
like 500 games now or whatever but I
don't know I like having something
physical I think it's really cool I like
the design of the nest it's you know a
classic and having that on the table is
like I don't know to me it's badass one
thing I don't like about the nest is the
design of the controller which they
unfortunately didn't update yeah even
rounded edges guys come on please please
they wanted to give us back the horrible
experience sorry it's framemeister oh
yeah that's what I was thinking of this
will do my bad retro Jen makes like
emulator console C indubitably something
says confirmed for old I mean it's true
yeah but that hurts man it's real bad
hurts real bad um you know what I don't
see a whole lot else here that we really
have to have to get into so thank you
guys very much for tuning in to the LAN
show we will see you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel by which
time i will probably have completely
rebuilt and reformatted the stupid
computer that's next to me that I hate
so very much hit us up on Twitter if you
want to see a build like streaming PC
build guide video oh yeah Nick's been
bugging me he's like yeah you should
like people have been telling me they
want to see build guides again
yeah I know they take a lot of time but
like I
it's interesting though like rebuilding
the winch because it's like sighs it's
like it's not that applicable to other
people like we're gonna build a
completely overpowered ridiculous
machine and like I don't I don't see
that being that valuable to anyone else
but okay well we'll talk about it all
right
all right all right see you guys thanks
for watching bye while I was waving you
had it over top of me so they couldn't
even see me at least tunnel bears not on
the show to that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
