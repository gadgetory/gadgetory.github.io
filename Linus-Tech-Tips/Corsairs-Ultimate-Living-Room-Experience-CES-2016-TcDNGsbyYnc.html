Lynas Media Group to CES 2016 check out
the link in the video description to
learn more about Squarespace welcome to
our second video at the course our suite
at CES 2016 in my lap I have one of the
two working models they have here of the
Corsair Bulldog this puppy's been a long
time coming so as a refresher if you've
forgotten since the first time you heard
about it
this is Corsairs concept for 4k gaming
in the living room because as we all
know the modern consoles aren't capable
of it and I mean you know if you
remember from my Alienware steam machine
video a lot of the other sort of pc type
consoles really aren't ready for it as
well so their concept was that okay we
need a case that small and media sentry
looking which unfortunately the Corsair
meant glossy plastic on the front I
really wish they'd gone with like a a
brushed finish and then in addition to
that we need adequate cooling for the
high-performance components inside in
order to have it not only run cool
enough for them to not thermal throttle
but also to be quiet so what that meant
was designing more than just a case they
actually had to develop an SFX line of
power supplies so this is the 600 watt
and then there's also a 450 watt that's
going to be available they had to design
this really cool well cooler it's called
the h5 SF and it's a blower design it
actually reminds me kind of like a heat
pipe blower in a laptop except instead
of heat pipes it's got water tubes that
go to the CPU it's like 40 millimeters
tall by 120 millimeters wide and they
figure it can handle anywhere from a 100
watt heat load like near silently up to
a 150 watt heat load they also had to
source a motherboard for it so they're
actually using a gigabyte z170 and Wi-Fi
as part of like a bare-bones kit and
then they also worked with MSI to
develop a liquid-cooled gtx 980ti
graphics card so the idea is that if you
buy all the components in the bulldog
ecosystem you can put together a
kick-ass silent gaming machine in terms
of the case itself obviously any ITX
motherboard is pretty much going to work
you could use a different SFX power
supply you can buy everything a la carte
because that's the corsair way but they
intend for people i think for the most
part to buy them as a bare-bones
furthermore
timid buyers who don't aren't familiar
with putting together a PC completely on
their own
so if you do that you can add yourself
up to three SSDs or a single SSD and a
three and a half inch drive and you
don't have to do a liquid-cooled
graphics card you can go air-cooled as
well now for me personally I'm not
necessarily that sold on where the
technologies at in terms of 4k gaming in
the living room angry Corsair brings up
to me that with overclocking their gtx
980ti can run up to 20% faster than a
standard 980 TI but personally i don't
necessarily think 20% is the difference
between 1080p k 1080p gaming and and 4k
gaming so I think the technology's got a
ways to go but if nothing else core Tara
Sarah is taking a step in the direction
of bringing 4k gaming to the living room
and at least their solution is actually
somewhat capable of doing it when you
compare it to well game consoles but of
course the Bulldog isn't the piece
that's actually supposed to go in your
lap no my friends this is the lap dog
and this is the sort of accessory for
the bulldog but also would be
appropriate for any number of other PC
solutions they go on your TV of which
there actually aren't that many but you
know we're not too stressed about that
if more are released the lap dog should
be a good accompaniment for them and
actually I'm a pretty big fan of this
product it's gone through some
evolutionary changes since the first
time we saw it like way back early last
year if I recall correctly and it seems
like for the most part they're not only
better than previous iterations but also
better than other similar concepts that
I've seen in the past so I actually
unboxed a phantom lap board way back in
the day it was like functional but
pretty pretty awful then I checked out
the nerdy tech couch master which has
the two big cushions on either side of
you and the big platform with active USB
cables and and all that kind of stuff
this takes that idea of having a
platform with you on the couch it like
kind of a TV tray so to speak and makes
it way more ergonomic and way easier to
store so I'll walk you guys through it
really quick you've got a single USB
connection that goes over to your
computer comes with I think it's
sixteen foot cord and then there's a
four port USB hub that allows you to
connect your keyboard your mouse and
then a couple of peripherals on the side
whether you want like a USB stick or
something like that or whatever the case
may be there's a swappable mousepad
platform over on the right-hand side and
this is cool there's a swappable
keyboard slot on the left it's
compatible with the K 65 and the K 70
keyboards not the strafe now with that
said I don't think that you're going to
like be ripping your keyboard out and
putting it back in all the time because
if you are using it properly you're
probably going to be using the cable
management like routing tray thing under
this handy little hinge up here to make
the whole thing really clean and really
tidy so you don't have any mouse cord
rag or anything along those lines this
is kind of I personally feel this is
kind of unnecessary but the really soft
like surprisingly softest like a it's
like a memory gel kind of like a really
nice material on the bottom is actually
detachable from the main born board via
magnets
I guess one benefit of this would be if
you wanted to put it on the coffee table
in front of you and you wanted to sit
flat it would be able to do that but
from an ergonomic standpoint I don't
really see why you wouldn't just want it
in your lap because unlike the couch
master it's not up at an uncomfortable
height I find it's at just the right
height for me to have my shoulders in a
relaxed position and game quite
comfortably on it I think this is a huge
step in the right direction and I need
more modularity is always nice but it's
not like the keyboards that go with it
are you know phantom lap board class
keyboards we're talking k70 RGB s with
Cherry MX switches so not exactly you
know slim pickins as far as that goes so
thanks for checking out video number two
from the corsair booth here at CES 2016
