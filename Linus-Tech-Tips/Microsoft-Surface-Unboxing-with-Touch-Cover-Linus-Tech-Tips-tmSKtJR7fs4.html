unboxing and first look at the surface
from Microsoft this is a ten point six
inch tablet and recommends represents
Microsoft's first foray into their own
branded hardware so I actually went to
the Microsoft Store and bought this
today if you follow me on Twitter then
you already know that there was a bit of
a lineup but I had like a reservation
thing I got the kit that comes with the
touch cover and the Windows RT tablet I
got a 32 gig surface remember a 32 gig
surface has a Windows operating system
installed on it so even though it's 32
gigs you don't actually get really that
close to 32 gigs of actual storage on
your surface tablet because the Windows
OS is a little bit bigger than we're
used to seeing from something like an
Android or an Apple mobile operating
system so inside I have the surface box
itself here and then I've also got a
separate box that has the touch cover so
touch cover is one of the biggest
innovations that Microsoft has really
brought about with surface and that it's
a nice little kind of suede II cover
that's actually quite nice Wow feels
really dense like it's a like it's the
material that's not just gonna kind of
crap out after a little while and then
the keyboard itself which is a touch
sensitive keyboard so they've kept top
funny-funny
okay iPhone size comparison so the so
the cover itself is not much thicker
than something like Apple's Smart Cover
it feels very durable it's quite rigid
and then they've actually built a
keyboard into it so the keyboard is
touch sensitive which means that you
type by by touching the spacebar or
touching the keys and it is pressure
sensitive but there's actually no
tactile feedback now there's a separate
type cover available that does have a
low-profile keyboard I'll look at that
one later as a separate unboxing but for
now we're gonna focus on the touch cover
it has again kind of a velvety sweetie
feel to it so it won't scratch up your
screen as long as you don't have any
sort of rocks or debris or anything
caught in it which shouldn't be that
much of an issue the surface uses a
proprietary six pin connector for data
and power for the touch cover itself and
it uses magnets to attach to the surface
it actually has a touch pad as well and
then that looks like left and right
mouse click button so that's cool I
haven't seen one in person yet so I'm
very excited about this
you've got proprietary keys up here and
you'll notice there's no f1 to f12 keys
however you can use the function key to
enable those buttons so if you wanted to
press alt f4 then you'd go alt function
and then F 1 2 3 4 in order to press
that ok so included pieces relatively ok
looking power brick it's around the size
of the Apple 1 and then uses a magnetic
connector here to charge the surface
tablet itself very very slick looking
there you go cameraman can have a look
at that if he sees fit the there you go
the problems just fold up like that just
a Windows RT sticker you can even take
that off and it be completely clean and
just black all along except for the
safety notifications and whatnots inside
here once we take out the surface don't
worry we'll look at that soon we've got
Microsoft's included little brochure
getting around in Windows RT so you
swipe from the right to open up the
charms menu if you this is French
if you move your if you're using the
trackpad move your pointer into any
corner ok to access charms get around
surface so they've got everything kind
of labeled their hardware setup software
so ok so this is a very very basic guide
there's really not a whole lot there
Windows 8 Pro in Windows RT so something
to note about Windows RT is that it's
environmentally friendly packaging
they're using just kind of a paper like
a look you can tell that it's like a
recycled paper because it's I'm assuming
it's a recycle paper because it's made
of sort of bits and pieces of other
kinds of paper you know what let's not
make any assumptions let's just say that
it's made of paper and is therefore
recyclable if
nothing else surface plastic here we go
I'm very excited about this hinge the
kickstand as they call it okay it's not
light actually it's not light but
Microsoft spent a lot of time optimizing
the weight distribution inside the
surface to make it so that however
you're holding it it should be
comfortable and it should feel similar
regardless of which side you're holding
it from so the idea is that even though
the weight is a little bit on the
heavier side for a tablet it's not like
a Galaxy Tab 10.1 or even the Asus vivo
tab which is very light also a Windows
RT device it feels ok to hold I also
like the squared corners these are a 22
degree angled edges all around the
entire outside of the tablet rounded
corners are nice in theory however you
can slip off them and this has a bit of
a catch to it so you can see it's not
quite just rounded and smooth but you
can actually hold on to it okay so I I
like that so far the kickstand itself
I have not sure how to operate it yet
but there you go so you pull it out
there makes that noise I guess they
apparently spent a lot of time on the
noise of the kickstand and when you
close it they're comparing it to a
luxury door luxury car door closing I'm
not quite sure I'd make that comparison
but I do like the way it slows down
before it hits it so that it doesn't
close to heart very nice yes so the
reason for the 22 degree edges here is
so that it'll actually sit flush when
you have the kickstand out and when
you're using it it's nice to have this
integrated as opposed to being part of
the smart cover if you guys have a smart
cover or a similar type cover for your
iPad I have a smart cover clone and what
I don't like about it is that it has
over time become far less rigid so it's
much harder to prop the device up on the
smart cover
whereas something like a kickstand I
don't think has the potential to ever
really become rigid you can see that
actually you can hear you can see the
design
that goes into these hinges it's got one
two three hinges here that are all look
very very robust I'm just gonna angle
this towards the light a little bit more
so you can see there all right there's
the connector down here okay yeah so
let's do the physical tour there's your
charging it's fine USB port that is a
USB port like you with an S and a B and
you can plug in pretty much whatever you
want as long as there's driver support
so things like printers aren't going to
be quite limited at the beginning
however any kind of input devices
keyboards mice but webcams potentially
again it'll come down to support should
work in this USB port right there we've
got what appears to be micro HDMI out
speaker here and a speaker here yes
stereo speakers take that Apple and not
position such that they'll be covered
when you're operating the tablet the
tablet is clearly meant to be used in a
horizontal landscape orientation so
there's your light sensor there's your
webcam there's something I don't know
what that is and then the windows button
is right here so if you use it like this
it'll be kind of weird if you're using
like a Skype video chat or anything like
that power buttons here and I am afraid
I don't actually quite know what these
are so we'll have to haha oh it doesn't
even say like that it doesn't actually
point at the speakers on this thing I'm
gonna assume they're more check this out
though so the the rear facing camera is
actually oriented a little bit strangely
if you can't see them sorry but it's
also oriented 22 degrees off so what
that means is if you pull the kickstand
out and place the surface down on
something that camera will be looking at
level now which means that if you're
walking around sort of you know do using
it as a camera in order to take a
picture straight ahead of you you
wouldn't hold it out like this instead
you'd hold it more like this so you're
looking down at it so that it'll take a
level picture okay moving right along
we've got another headphone jack volume
rocker and really nothing nothing
extraordinary in terms of IO other
that USB port so the setup process is
doesn't take that long but I don't know
if I'll bring you guys along for the
whole thing of course we're reading the
EULA very carefully
Microsoft spent a lot of time on the
screen as well so even though the screen
is only 1366 by 768 it is using a bit of
a special technology that allows the
panel itself to be much closer to the to
your eyes then okay so there's a few
layers so is your glass layer there's
your there's your touchscreen interface
layer there's your actual LCD panel
layer and what they're trying to do is
they're trying to minimize the air gaps
in between get them as close as possible
because what that does is it reduces
reflectivity so while the surface is
reflective it'll be more difficult to
make out the details of the cameraman
based on what I'm seeing already in it
then it would be with something that had
a bigger air gap that's where that's
where that innovation comes from so give
me a sec guys I'm just gonna get the
wireless set up and moved back I missed
a small detail before actually a pretty
major detail the micro SDXC port is here
under the kickstand so not around the
edge it's something you'll never see
once you put it in there it'll be
completely covered just like that I
wonder if you can pry the kickstand up
without I know you can that's not that's
not actually too difficult so I want to
show you guys how the touch cover 2
attaches so cameraman actually did this
with me off camera so I don't oh okay
Wow
okay so it actually aligns itself pretty
easily
even though see you can see the
orientation is not even close and it
just kind of figures itself correctly
without any difficulty now you've seen
people doing this on the Internet
but I'm actually going to do it live
here for you guys just to show that it's
not going anywhere
now cameras take on this form factor and
we're gonna do the iPhone comparison
again that's how thick it is with the
touch cover is that it's bulky to which
I would reply okay yes it is bulky
compared to your iPad 2 or your iPad 3
because it is a slimmer device
this does way more the touch cover what
I didn't realize about it is I was kind
of going yeah it's really thin it's
really thin it does way more than you
know most tablet covers will but if you
compare this not to a tablet but to a
notebook because remember this device is
actually capable of being a Productivity
tool unlike most notebooks which aren't
even close to that because of the fact
that it does have a notebook able
notebook ready resolution of 1366 by 768
you can attach a full keyboard to it
and it does have Microsoft Office that
to me makes a very big difference now
this is my very first time with the
touch cover I'm gonna fire upward and
there's been a lot of talk about how
does the touch cover compare to typing
on a real keyboard so let's go with hell
no that's not what I meant to say hello
world this is me look I can this one
this is my first attempt on the touch
cover I think I'm doing pretty well so
is it perfect no but there are bumps
here well they're not bumps there are
actually gaps in the letters that will
give you some idea if you just kind of
go like this it's not gonna detect any
button presses because it's pressure
sensitive so the pressure whoops that
was just a typo sensitive touch cover
may take some getting used to very
responsive though so there's no there's
no delay there's no look there's no lag
there's no weirdness that's been
associated with some Bluetooth keyboards
in the past the touch pads not bad I
wish it was a little bit bigger but
there's only there's only so much you
can do
accuracy when you're moving really
really slowly I'd say is not as good as
I'd like you can see it kind of drifting
a little bit there and I I don't know
what they can do about that because it's
sort of the fuzzy felt kind of material
that they're using I don't know how you
maintain that kind of accuracy without a
more without a more smooth surface that
to use so Metro UI
start button will do that in theory will
it what are we doing here start button
there we go what does that one do okay
well that one does it um the modern UI
so what apps can you use on this thing
you will have to shop in the Microsoft
Store because this is an ARM
architecture device this is using a
Tegra 3 processor which is a quad-core
processor but not like the fastest
mobile processor in the world by any
stretch these days what that means is
there's no backwards compatibility with
your normal Windows devices surface pro
is coming and surface pro will be an x86
device which means you can install
anything you want in this one the
desktop is whoops that's whether the
desktop is available but it's almost the
only things you can really do are things
like accessing your classic task manager
your your resource monitor your your
office suite which they haven't really
changed the interface much compared to
what we've seen on desktop versions you
can use the File Explorer and you can
actually use that with the USB port you
have access to where Windows is actually
installed so you can see there's 17 gigs
free out of our 32 gigs total so you
know users you can browse and you can
move files around just the way you would
on a real computer but you can't go and
install like CPU said to tell you about
the processor in here it just doesn't
work that way so the pro will be x86 so
you're going to be doing mostly
everything from this UI here and the
animations are very very smooth
Microsoft's work very hard on making
sure that they don't have some of those
early Android sort of awkwardness things
going on where the animations start to
look very jerky if you do certain things
so the store everything will be through
the store an app written for the modern
UI or the Metro UI whatever you want to
call it should be compatible with
Windows 8 and with Windows RT even
though they're really not the same thing
just with a recompile
it's just older apps where you're gonna
run into that difficulty and it'll take
time for things to get updated
I mean you've got your Netflix New York
Times it'll take again it'll take time
but it's Microsoft they'll find a way to
get the right things released people are
complaining
especially reviewers about the lack of a
Facebook or a Twitter app especially
from the start there's a new a gap come
on guys
gotta go getting in my video here and I
think that pretty much covers it for now
now it's possible cameraman and I
screwed something up because while it
was setting up we were playing around
with the keyboard but now that we've
done a quick reboot everything is
working correctly so the windows button
now works swiping in from the right
aha charms menu so that'll is where
you'll access your search although it's
totally unnecessary to do that because
you can just type control panel and you
don't even have to open up the search in
order to search for something which i
think is fantastic sharing is gonna be
well for sharing things nothing can be
shared from the desktop its context
you'll let's go back to the Metro from
the modern UI modern UI settings so
these are really smart the way they've
got this implemented I love the way that
they've done volume and power where it
actually just readjusts where it is to
where you left it off and then you can
go up or down from there same thing with
screen brightness so you can always
access settings like screen brightness
without digging through your menus if
you're someone like me who's constantly
tinkering with screen brightness you're
gonna appreciate stuff like this as you
move from you know darker rooms to
brighter rooms or whatever else the case
may be swiping from the bottom and from
the top are things that are going to be
specific to given applications so here
we're in Internet Explorer 10 you can
change a lot of settings in IE 10
through the modern you all actually you
can't really change any settings in IE
10 through the modern UI see there's a
few internet options here but most of
them are going to be changed anything
more advanced from the desktop internet
explorer and you can use this one if you
prefer remember this is Internet
Explorer 10 fully flash enabled unlike
other mobile platforms now so that's
something that may matter to certain
people
like me for example so let's go back to
our modern UI so let's go ahead and open
a couple of things in open a new tab
hold it down
open a new whoops copy link nope I press
the wrong thing open link in new tab so
we've got a few tabs this is how its
handling tab browsing you scroll down
from the top and then you navigate to
whichever one that you want you've got a
nice little preview there you can also
add tabs this way and then just key and
manually what you want so for example
ponies we could look at pictures of
ponies on the internet very quickly on
the surface from Microsoft swiping in
from the left hand side gives you access
to a multitasking sort of menu here
since we've only got one oh yeah
right screen sharing so there's true
multitasking on Windows RT you could
have like Skype running here with a
video preview you could have a messenger
application you can have anything you
want actually running from either side
oh actually I don't know I don't
remember how you do it this way no
that's not right Wow how do that ah here
okay so here's task switching give me a
sec I'll figure out how that works give
me one moment so let's fire up the Maps
app and it'll just use GPS to zone and
on wherever we happen to be I've seen a
lot of complaints about application
loading time for me I'm still using an
iPhone 4 so it doesn't bother me that
much but that's where we are if you want
to search for something nearby then you
can just kind of go McDonald's and in
theory really no results were found for
my search I've never used Bing Maps
before so it's possible that I'm doing
it wrong somehow
but let's go with NCIX and see if it
manages to find ah yes so NCIX is more
important to Microsoft than McDonald's
apparently which is awesome so it shows
us a bunch of different ones you can
browse between them like this I promised
to show you guys how the how the
multitasking are task switching works so
what you do is you drag in from the left
and then back out and you can easily
switch between any of the apps that you
have open is extremely fast and feels
very smooth and go all the way up to the
desktop where we have
Word document that we're working on and
then you can also bring any of those
applications out to the forefront like
this and then you can also pin them to
the side just like that so that's how
that whole thing works so we're playing
back Big Buck Bunny in 1080p and the
realization oh oh we figured out how to
put tasks over here as well is that it
is a little bit on the cha twelve it's
not a little bit choppy it is choppy
it's not quite it's not quite able to do
that yet this is using the is this using
the modern browser
yeah modern browser versus the desktop
version browser however it's watchable
it's certainly watchable I do want to
show you guys how to do this though so
if you wanted to move let's say okay so
there I think you guys get the point so
we've got our Photos app open and if we
wanted our Photos app on the right-hand
side we open that first then we take
maps and we don't do that we go to our
Photos app sorry I'm still getting used
to it this is literally my first time
sitting down with this then we take maps
and we bring it out here then we go like
this now we can see our wonderful photos
which we haven't added any of here while
we use the Maps app in the foreground
and you can switch them back and forth
like that or even swipe the whole thing
away if you want to close an app you
just take it and drag it all the way
down to the bottom and it will be close
so it's not using up any resources
however you do have two gigs of ram so
unless you're running heavy-duty
applications you shouldn't run up
against that too often because you'll be
cpu limited in more cases than not
compared to being ram limited so I think
that pretty much wraps it up for my
Windows Windows RT and Microsoft Surface
first impressions it's not that warm
it's a touch warm here but it's very
localized the edges are still quite cool
which is nice because that means when
you're holding it like this you're not
gonna get that sweaty palms thing going
on that you do with some with some
mobile devices the iPad 3 in particular
I have a hard time dealing with whereas
the iPad 2 I find is just just
spectacular
so what's the point of all this to me
this isn't a tablet so much as it is a
laptop replacement and it's not quite a
laptop replacement because you can't do
the same kind of serious work on this
that you can on a laptop so we're at
kind of this this point of either
convergence or divergence depending on
how you want to look at it where these
kinds of devices where you can use the
touchscreen to interact here you can use
the mouse and the keyboard to interact
here are not going away this is this is
here to stay and I really like the usage
model just not quite sure where it fits
in with this whole RT arm powered thing
I'm really excited to check out surface
pro which is coming soon thank you for
checking out this unboxing your first
look on - tech tips and don't forget to
subscribe a cameraman sort of put it in
his way and he's more of an Apple guy
but his comment is this is for people
who don't want the lock down restriction
of the iPad they want more productivity
than that but aren't necessarily typing
5,000 word essays on a regular basis so
this is good enough also I realized I
never did show the camera app the camera
app is pretty straightforward so you got
your 720p camera on the front you can
switch cameras like that and like I said
see it's looking straight ahead in spite
of the fact that the kickstand is out
motions pretty smooth camera options are
pretty limited so you can adjust your
resolution or you can adjust your audio
device that's about it and then you can
switch from video mode to camp ooh
that's fast video mode or not video mode
so let's go ahead and point it so this
is this is how I use it to point it
straight ahead see which was actually
kind of nice as long as you're filming
at this level but if you were like
trying to see over a crowd at a concert
or something with your tablet and take a
video I mean people who take video on
their tablets in public though no
offense but I mean if you were trying to
do that then it'd be kind of awkward but
here let's go ahead and look at this
plant I'm not super it's not super high
light sort of scenario here but we can
go ahead and you just touch the screen
in order to take a picture and what I
meant to do was take a video so we can
capture video this frame rates not
particularly high but there's the plans
and there's the bottom of the plant and
we can stop it just like that there's
not really a delay though that's kind of
nice so let's see how fast the shutter
is here let's take a picture of some
cars that's nice then we go ahead and go
back to the main thing and then we can
open our whoopsie-daisy that's not what
I was looking for
I need that sorry like I said still
getting used to it guys and then I'm
looking for the Photos app which I have
now lost well yeah they're just
frightened right in the middle right in
the middle of like everything pictures
library now has all the pictures I took
there you go camera roll just like that
there's the video okay let's see if play
lacks like on that there you go okay
we're done for real this time don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
and my luxury car audio luxury car audio
I'm still sick I'm still a little like
no not quite
you know card or tablet that I got</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
