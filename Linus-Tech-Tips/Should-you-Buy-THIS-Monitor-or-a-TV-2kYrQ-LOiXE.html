been much smaller than TVs you know to
fit on your desk and with much higher
pixel density to make them suitable for
up close viewing of fine details like
text but thanks to 4k Ultra HD
resolution a 43 inch TV would actually
have the same detail level at an equal
distance as a 21 and a half inch 1080p
monitor which seems to be exactly what
LG was thinking when they created the 43
UD 79 a product they're calling a
monitor that's the size of a TV for a
price that somewhere in between
check out AI by powers gaming desktops
featuring until seventh generation Core
i7 7700 K processor on new egg at the
link below the 43 UT 79 or beauty as
I'll be calling it is the biggest
monitor ever to grace our lab beating
the previous champ Phil who you can meet
over here by 3 whole inches the idea
here is that the giant factory
calibrated IPS panel will give you wide
viewing angles and accurate though not
professional-grade
colors making tasks like heavy
multitasking system monitoring and wolf
of Wall Street style stock trading super
immersive without the head turning or
disruptive bezels that a multi screen
setup would require ok then with you so
far this giant uncurbed monitor then
rests on a 13-pound stand that gets an
extra bonus by the way for being super
hefty but and this won't be the last TV
like thing about it like most TVs has
very limited mobility we get a nice
amount of tilt but no height adjust or
swivel which might actually be a bigger
deal than normal if you want to quickly
turn UT from your office chair to your
bed for movie time around the back io is
unusually well labeled a really nice
touch for anyone who doesn't have the
resolution support chart memorized for
every revision of HDMI not to mention
super comprehensive the extra type-c
port for DisplayPort is particularly
forward-thinking and here's something
interesting it's got an rs-232 C port
this was the standard for connecting
modems and other peripherals to your PC
before USB came along and more
importantly in the home theater world
it's used to connect your home
automation and control systems so you
can do things like automatically mute
the TV when the doorbell rings cool
right
but wait a minute it's almost as if LG
wants you to use UD like you would a TV
he even comes with a freaking remote
that you can use instead of the nipple
to face to turn the bright Ness up and
down and control the volume volume
that's right like again many of LG's TVs
UT is equipped with 210 watt speakers
and unlike most monitor speakers they're
surprisingly not bad ok Linus so what's
the heck in difference between a monitor
with speakers and a TV then well if
you're my grandparents and you still
have a coax cable plugged into the back
of your TV instead of a digital set-top
box that connects via HDMI I guess
there's that but otherwise not much so
let's talk then about what it's like to
use a TV like monitor frankly at normal
desk distance it is not my favorite
personally yes you can use LG's included
screen splitting software to have 421
inch windows open at a time but most of
the content we create around here and
consume like Word documents and just
about anything on the web is better when
your window is taller than it is wide
so even though UT is 6 inches taller
than the 38 inch ultra wide on my desk
the whole ultra wide pitch also from LG
was that it fits your field of view so
then depending on your personal
preference that might end up being 6
inches of not very useful space because
you need to move your mouse not to
mention your eyes a long way between the
bottom and the top of the screen which
combined with the stands in mobility can
make for a fatiguing experience and
finally there's pixel density everyone
agrees 4k TVs look amazing from the
couch but we're sitting really close
here at this size
neither James nor I was that impressed
and with high-end displays shipping with
retina like sharpness this really felt
like a step backwards to me and in
response to your comment Jeff no I'm not
gonna move the screen back because if I
was gonna do that what
I just save a buck and get a smaller
screen all of that said not everyone
will agree some of you will really want
a ginormous display but this one at 43
inches and $700 costs about what a 4k 55
inch TV would so why not just buy the TV
then well pixel density at that size is
even more of an issue
but other than that there used to be
some additional and serious concerns
when using a TV as a monitor like high
colour compression that made text look
blurry and brutal input lag that made
gaming nearly impossible but these are
non issues on many modern TV sets where
444 chroma subsampling keeps the text
readable and features like game mode
lower the input lag to more workable
levels though it must be said that not
every new TVs game mode actually turns
all image processing off display leg
comm is a great resource for finding one
that doesn't suck bottom line then a lot
of TVs have pretty much caught up to
monitor performance except for special
features like ultra-high refresh rates
that are demanded by hardcore gamers so
back to UT then if Beauty had cutting
edge monitor only features like free
sync or G sync for gamers as well as
higher refresh rate and super low input
lag then it would be able to clearly
differentiate itself from both a TV and
a monitor as it is though it's an
in-between size with mostly TV like
performance and features at a reasonable
price making it a solid product and one
that lots of people will like especially
given the matte panel when most TVs are
glossy but it's not for me personally so
I'm going with the official mattes up to
you I guess stamp of approval I mean
that is what you guys pay me for right
if you know I fix it you know that they
really like taking stuff apart and
teaching people how to fix their stuff
