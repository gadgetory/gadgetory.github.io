and thick as the MacBook Pro but the G
701 also houses 13 hundred percent the
graphics horsepower so the way we see it
if you're going to spend three grand on
a laptop it might as well be capable of
physically crushing the other guys
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel there the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description it's not exactly hard
to tell that the G 701 VI is a gaming
laptop the outside is brushed aluminum
with red lighting on the back that makes
it look mean and ready for business no
not that kind of business gaming
business with a 17.3 inch screen and a
330 watt power brick that could probably
double as a bludgeoning device you don't
even have to see the specs to know it's
an absolute monster the IO is a solid
mix of more than your old probably need
plus a Thunderbolt 3 port allowing up to
three external 4k displays and internal
highlights include a core i7 78 20 HK
processor don't know what that is no
problem it's a high TDP mobile chip with
support for overclocking and asus has
cranked it up to a whopping four point
three gigahertz
and in addition to that we've got an
overclocked desktop-class GTX 1080
thats it said wha seriously 1923
megahertz from our measurements that is
faster than a Founders Edition desktop
card what the stuff and gaming
performance is what you'd expect from
this combo it destroyed everything in
our test suite yielding a hundred and
twenty FPS in several modern triple-a
titles on Ultra settings at 1080p and
never scoring below 60fps in anything
the best part is you'll get to see all
of those frames too if you get a model
like ours with the 120 Hertz 1080p
g-sync panel it really gets a chance to
flex its muscles in fast paced FPS games
like doom now you probably won't care
about how accurate the full sRGB color
space coverages while you're spinning
around smashing demons heads in
but I'm pleased to report that the IPS
panel does a good enough job in this
regard with solid viewing angles and
adequate brightness as a bonus and at no
point during our testing did we feel
like motion blur or input lag were a
problem but this is the big question
about laptops and portable devices in
general can it maintain that level of
performance under an extended load
without resorting to bulky or risky
water cooling strategies in short yeah
running firm arc GPU stress test in
extreme overclocking mode the GPU
stabilized at 79 degrees while
maintaining a very impressive 1923
megahertz CPU cooling didn't blow us
away to quite the same degree after it
fell to a measly 3.8 gigahertz and i-264
after shooting up to 94 degrees and it's
overclocked 4.3 gigahertz but in
fairness we did never run into that
issue in our non-synthetic tests and it
topped out under 80 degrees Celsius in
our gaming benchmarks the G 701 VI noise
level while gaming is what I would
describe as acceptable to its credit it
avoids the high-pitched whine of smaller
gaming laptops and is basically silent
relative to the Sager NP 98-73 when that
thing is pushed to its limit but it
still definitely lets you know it's
there it's kind of like a hot air
balloon parked above your neighbor's
house one sore spot for me given the
price tag is that upgrading this thing
is a bit of a pain in the arse getting
inside takes 14 screws and once you're
in there
half the RAM slots are on the underside
of the motherboard and the same goes for
the SSDs only one of them can be easily
accessed though that kind of thing won't
come up that often so let's move on to
day to day usability I'm not totally
sure how I feel about the keyboard for
typing the short travel distance and key
spacing is fine and I easily got up to
speed
but there's more flex than I'd like
especially near the space bar and I just
didn't find it that comfortable with
that said the gaming tuned feel of the
key switches and the shape of the space
bar the five programmable macro keys and
the keyboard backlighting bring my grade
up to a B or at least they would if it
included RGB backlighting is a gaming
product for shame a soos the trackpad is
what I would consider very usable
straight out of the box it's actually
great but if your fingers get sweaty at
all it turns into a bit of a grind
magnet and it's easy for your fingers to
kind of skip across it which does hurt
accuracy when you're trying to be very
precise with it the odds that a would be
G 701 VI shopper will have a gaming
mouse hooked up to it all the time
though are pretty high
I just think Asus could have done better
in this regard
speakers are decent for a laptop with
fair bass and no distortion even at full
volume although again if you're gaming
you're probably going to have headphones
plugged in but fortunately Asus has you
covered there too and the 701 VI sports
an ESS saber DAC and amp getting up near
external DAC quality and it's nice to
see this included now of course everyone
in the comments is probably saying this
is stupid just buy our game and our shop
and honestly it's no secret that as a
filthy casual grade gamer these days
I run a thin in life but let's say you
did want a full fat gaming experience
that's portable have you ever carried a
desktop as your carry-on on a plane I
have and it's a massive pain and takes
up all your space and weight allowances
so if you regularly move around for work
or school the G 701 VI ticks all the
right boxes for me as long as you have
$3500 to blow on a laptop have you ever
thought gee I'd love to build a website
