look at a video card that is a
compelling value so I'm not even going
to tell you guys what it is although if
you want to cheat you could always look
at the title of the video which you've
probably already done because there's
not a whole lot of point watching a
video unless you've already watched the
title to find out if you're interested
in it or not although you can tell that
to all the people who watch the videos
that I do about Apple stuff and then
come in to dislike my video you know
make negative comments about about Apple
people who use iPhones and - but
whatever I'm not sad or depressed
because today we are not talking about
Apple we're talking about a pretty sweet
graphics card from XFX this is like I
said before one of the best values out
there it is the Radeon HD 7850 and this
particular one has a few things that are
special about it it has two gigs of ram
which is ok not that not that special
not that abnormal it also has there a DD
cooler which is to say that it has two
fans for double the dissipation of one
fan okay so it doesn't quite work out to
half the temperatures but you will get
significantly better temperatures and
we've seen this time and time again
versus a reference cooler so I know I'm
unboxing this really quickly but I
actually just want to kind of you have
everything in front of me before I start
to talk about it too much okay
in terms of included accessories XFX
gives you a crossfire bridge that's your
standard length crossfire bridge if you
need a bigger one it should come with
your motherboard they give you a door
hanger that says do not disturb
I am gaming so like screw off oh no it
doesn't say that nevermind no it's just
a picture of like army dudes okay on the
back they've got their part number their
serial number as well as your personal
activation code which is really cool
because they give you this convenient
neat piece of swag to keep all the
information that you need on in case you
need to contact their customer service
which is handy because last thing you
want to do when you're like diagnosing
something is like stick your head inside
your computer and try to read serial
number off the very bottom of the PCI
Express slot so that's a much more
convenient way to do that Pro Series
powers class so they've got some other
products from XFX that you might want to
check out including their adapters and
connectors and whatnots hardware limited
warranty okay
region-specific so you want to check
online for the details however XFX
has one of the best reputations in the
biz in the entire graphics card business
when it comes to warranty and customer
support
once again this is something that I've
seen time and time again countless
testimonials for XFX and the way that
they do business so there you go there's
the sexy graphics card with their ghost
cooler and let's finish off seeing what
XFX has to say for themselves about it
more memory for high resolutions right
this is good compared to other cards in
this price range
the 7850 has lots of memory why is that
important someone message me on YouTube
not that long ago asking if I could do
benchmarks on the gtx 550 ti in surround
gaming mode i said no i'm not going to
bother because the performance is going
to be horrible because it doesn't have
enough memory and honestly the GPU
doesn't really have the horses either
she messages me back a little while
later he says oh well i bought it and i
benchmarked it and just so you know the
performance is really horrible and I'm
like I know um yes it is you need a more
powerful graphics card you need more
memory if you want to run high
resolutions so there you go more details
and better gaming yes all of this is
true ghosts thermal maximizes airflow
for exceptional venting throughout the
card let's have a look at that when we
when we check out the cooler key
features um wow that's no way
mosquito noise reduction do they mean
like coil line do you think that's what
they mean I mean I can tell you guys now
that I've had pretty bad experiences
overall with reference cards on the AMD
side for coil line that is that noise
that can come out of the back of the
card when you play a game so you know
we're going to do before we finish this
unboxing we're gonna go plug this into
something and let you guys know if this
card wins so you guys will know for sure
multi monitor difference yes all of this
is true Andy does have the best
multi-monitor support when it comes to
managing your desktops as well as
configuring it bar none ok next
generation architecture so this is you
are right this is using their new 28
nanometer family of processors so yes
they're fast yes they run cool they're
also fully capable of running 4k
displays we
is awesome and I personally am looking
forward to 4k displays in a huge way
this is interesting so they are calling
their professional grade components
duratec which basically means solid caps
very core chokes XFX bracket design and
a dust free IP 5x fan meet check that
out so they actually have a blocker in
there so remember guys just free doesn't
necessarily mean that you're not going
to get like dust and like gunk buildup
on your fan but what it means is the fan
itself is sealed so you won't get dust
inside it causing it to not work anymore
which is way more important actually all
right so the ghost cooler the idea of
this is that they are throwing heat
basically all over the card all over
every part of it making sure that the
entire card is adequately cooled because
it's really easy to build a cooler that
cools the GPU core itself really well
but might not actually provide adequate
cooling to other things that can cause
instability when overclocking as well so
you can see they've got a yuna sync
across the almost the entire bottom of
the card covering things like the RAM
the V RMS now you see going all the way
to the back of the card and that is
what's going to spread the heat around
and make sure that it can be adequately
cooled by these two double D fans that
are on the top of the card blower well
rather on the bottom of the card blowing
up we also see that they've got really
four heat pipes they claim for you pipes
but I don't see them oh wow they've got
a really really tight stack there of
four key pipes that go right directly
over the core and carry the heat as far
away as you do this one over here goes
all the way over here so you can see
that the way XFX has laid out the heat
pipes they are distributing them as
evenly as possible except where it's
totally unnecessary so right directly
over the core there aren't really any
heat pipes going there because they're
getting incidental airflow from both
sides from these fans and heat will be
transmitted directly up the aluminum
fins from the core itself and then
dissipated away by these fans so the
heat pipes are carrying heat here here
here and here where it will then be sort
of blown all out the bottom what's cool
about this open bottom on the card is
that it actually keeps the motherboard
components from getting too hot hot
running graphics cards can easily
transmit heat even through conduction to
your motherboard because they are
physically can
acted so the motherboard right under the
graphics card can often run extremely
hot which can be stressful on the
components if you have a video card that
is actively cooling the motherboard from
the fans all the time then that's better
so there you go you have that now the
disadvantage of a heatsink design like
this is that it doesn't exhaust all the
air out the back which can be good for
cases that have poor airflow however if
you have a case that has good airflow
this will definitely give you better
temperatures and better overclocking
than a reference design cooler on the
back we find two mini display ports on
HDMI as well as two DVI ports and we've
also got there's there XFX bracket
giving you I guess a little bit more
airflow than just the standard slit
design but not a ton of air is going to
be going out the back of the case with a
design like this anyway this is a PCI
Express 3.0 graphics card it also
supports crossfire so you can see we've
got one crossfire finger on the back it
is a power efficient card whether it's
out idle or under gaming load however
you still do need two PCIe six pin power
connectors and like almost every XFX
card I've ever seen it has a matte black
PCB they were the ones who started this
before the others and so they get credit
for making like the best possible PCB
configuration because matte black is
awesome and every PCB should be matte
black on the top we've got their
branding elements so XFX are 7850 with
ghost thermal technology and their
double D cooler they also got no more
shiny XFX s going on XFX really does
build beautiful cards and I mean so they
should they've been doing this for a
while I think that pretty much wraps it
up so it supports up to four displays up
to 4k high resolution displays and it
has the power gusto and in gaming horses
to actually drive them remember guys not
only surround gaming requires lots of
memory high resolution also requires
more memory so if you want to get a
value card that's still going to at
least be able to run it and not run out
of memory at high res you will need
something with at least two gigs
something like this is probably a good
bet don't forget to subscribe to Linus
