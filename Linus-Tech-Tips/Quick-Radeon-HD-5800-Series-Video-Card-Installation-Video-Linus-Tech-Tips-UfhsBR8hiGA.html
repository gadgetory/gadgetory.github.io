to do a quick video because we've been
having some problems with 50 850 900
series video cards and shipping in
shipping them with systems we've
actually witnessed a couple of
situations where because the video card
has such a heavy cooler on it it can
actually snap the PCI Express slot like
split it into when the weight of the
video card is is is put on it that way
so with some customers who are buying
these video cards and cases that you
know we might not be able to pack as
well we've were asking customers if they
would be comfortable if we ship the
system with no video card but otherwise
completely assembled and then ship the
video card separately so I'm doing like
just a quick guide on how to install a
video card if you've never done it
before so our team will prep everything
for you so all you really have to do is
make sure that it's lined up with the
correct slots here in the back and the
correct slot so it'll be a PCI Express
16x slot which will look something like
that and then you can take your 5800
series video card just position it in
exactly the right place so just line it
up so that the fingers at the bottom of
the card are not under but rather
directly into the PCI Express slot push
down firmly okay then what you'll need
to do is if your case uses thumb screws
then you'll use the thumb screws to
secure the two holes up at the top of
the i/o plate so one and then if you do
not have thumb screws with your case
then you'll need to use a screwdriver to
secure both of those screws this is what
holds it in place and so you can see
that I mean okay with the only things
holding a video card in place being
these two screws and this plastic clip
here it's not exactly the most robust
solution so you can see there's quite a
bit of room to move there that's why
they're proposing this and then the last
thing that you'll need to make sure that
you do is plug in the power connector or
connectors which are either located at
the back of the video card just like
that or on the top edge of the video
card so you can see there's one clip on
the one side and I'm positioning it so
that that clip plugs right into the
video card until it goes all the way in
on both of them thank you for checking
out my quick video car
installation guide for your reference
that was a power color 5830 that I
installed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
