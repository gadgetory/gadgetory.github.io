little thing crazy Russians been working
on we've actually done another batch of
red cases and this is for a new special
edition system so once again we're only
going to be building five of these but
this is going to be the Vesta a one so
this is an all AMD build inside you'll
find Anna Sue's crosshair for formula
with a wonderfully color-coded overall
scheme to it we've got corsair dominator
GT ram the AMD phenom 2 x6 of the six
core 1100 T and finally the radeon HD
6990 it's lit with red LEDs so in the
dark and I unfortunately can't really
turn off the lights in our office
otherwise people get upset it looked
simply stunning we've gone with a
blu-ray rewriter for the optical drive
just so that you have the flexibility to
do whatever it is you could possibly see
fit and we're using a corsair force 3
sandforce SSD for our storage needs now
these do not have a hard drive by
default because the intention for the
first two systems anyway is for them to
be demos at the AMD booth at e3 so
please let us know with a comment on the
video if you do see one of these systems
on display oh yeah one thing I missed is
that we have the brand-new corsair h16
here it's got a very solid looking
mounting system overall I think it'd be
pretty much impossible to remove that
from the cpu socket so that's
outstanding and the system also stays
very cool and very quiet the noise
signature of the 6990 particularly is
dramatically improved from the original
launch cards that we saw that got so
loud up here we have some cooler master
are for fans it would appear not yet
crazy Russian confirms that those are
red LED fans and I suspect we'll get a
little bit brighter if you turn up the
fan speed but then they're also louder
so there you go
all of this is in one of our custom
painted 650 DS and I think that's pretty
much all there is to say about if you do
end up going to e3 check this out in the
AMD booth don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips from our own boxing's
reviews and other apparently random
computer videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
