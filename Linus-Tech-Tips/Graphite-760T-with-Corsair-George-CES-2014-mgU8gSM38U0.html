brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital now my biggest criticism
of Corsairs innovation in the case
market has to be the fact that they
still haven't come out with a four-door
model they all have two doors now they
moved a little bit more towards the
direction of addressing the needs of
people who want more doors on their
cases with the 250d over there but this
while it doesn't necessarily deal with
that one complaint does address a
complaint I didn't have and that is that
cases need to be more see-through ok now
I've given you a totally sarcastic intro
here but honestly I love this thing
George tell us about the 760 T with this
full windowed side panel and you got to
walk us through this a little bit here
all right cool
like you mentioned this is graphite
series 760 T it's a full tower case it's
based on the award-winning 750 one of
the cool things about it like you
mentioned is that full side panel window
but that's just kind of the cosmetic
part of it so it's hinged so you can
just open it really easily and get into
your parts access real easy real quick
and it's hinged on a pin so you just
want to pull it off it comes right off
and you can take care of it and put it
away so it doesn't get scratched while
you're working on your system the nice
thing about the inside of it so the nice
thing about the inside of it is actually
it maintains almost all the 750d
features you have dual 140 millimeter
front fans with a 280 or 240 millimeter
radiator mount you have a 360 minute
amount on top you have 140 in the back
you can put a single 120 on the bottom
those side mounted SSDs that everyone
really liked on the 750 or back and then
the removable and relocatable harddrive
cages are there so this case has 9
expansion slots so it's a true full
Tower as well it's really solid
performance wise and it looks really
good to that full window gives you the
ability to show off your full system and
we've just put some corsair league
lighting stuff in there to show off the
lighting capabilities now to be there's
a couple things that I want to talk
about that you didn't necessarily touch
on and that is a I love 750d I think
it's a great layout and the fact that it
now has a more aggressive looking
aesthetic I mean not everyone is going
to like this better that's the cold hard
truth but they don't have to now that
there's a more aggressive looking
aesthetic option for the people who
don't like the clean lines as much as
they like the blaze
I think that's fantastic and something
you guys can't see but we'll get you
some b-roll footage of is the fact that
there's actually an acrylic panel on the
other side as well so that one's not
see-through so you don't have to see all
the cable management behind it but it
gives it a more balanced aesthetic so
how long has this one been in the pipe
we've been working on this since about a
year to 15 months so about a little over
a little under a year and a half one of
the things we thought of was we needed
to come up with a new full Tower chassis
so 750d was the basis for it but then we
know we had to come up with a couple
different variants tooling up a base
chassis is very expensive so we know
that not everyone likes the Obsidian
style ID so we wanted to dress it up a
little bit with some other designs so
this is one of the other designs we've
been working on is the 760 now normally
I object to a very very large window but
I think you guys are getting away with
it here because of the excellent cable
management and because of the good looks
at the inside and you know what guys
think about this for a moment when you
see a really cool build how often is it
that you know like say for example of a
fractal define our for build how often
is it that you see people do their
finish shot with the side panel off
because the cable management looks so
good or whatever it is that they did
well that's what this looks like all the
time with the complete look at you kind
of can't even tell we took the window
after there's a little latch here and
then because it's made of plexi it's
obviously not that structurally strong
compared to a piece of metal but there
are magic pieces here and here also
known as magnets that allow it to stay
in place and still maintain that flesh
that looks good I think you guys did a
really great job on this one
thanks very much George for walking us
through it as there any other crazy
stuff in here that you'd like to just
kind of point out and say hey this might
be cool as well just the fact that we
have tons of clearance up here for
taller radiators - I met that power
supply power supply oh yeah by the way
this is a prototype of the ax 1509 power
supply the 1500 eye is kind of like the
1200 eye with a couple of big changes
obviously there's more power to it but
the other side of it is it's now what
would be the draft of the titanium spec
so the 80 plus titanium spec doesn't
exist right now but there's kind of a
draft of it and this meets that draft
spec so kind of like you were mentioning
draft end routers or you know draft a/c
or whatever it was now it's it's kind of
the draft spec of the Titan
certified efficiency the other side of
it is we went out and said we wanted
power suppose to be even quieter with
our M we got them down to a really low
noise level by actually hand select the
electric oh I get it so draft means you
have air flow all the time rather than
actually oh wait hold on maybe I
misunderstood no exactly not that ya
know basically the premise is that that
there are other things inside your Paris
way that cause most besides the fan and
we had fanless modes and power supplies
for a long time one of the things that
people notice when the fan isn't
spinning is you can sometimes hear an
electrical buzz or coil and things like
that so with our M series we actually
spent a year figuring out how to hand
select each little component so you
wouldn't get electrical noise and that's
been brought to this series as well so
all new HX + ax level power supplies RM
and up basically everything will have
the hand-selected components to cut down
on coil wah buzz whine and all that
stuff like that so it's actually it's
coil wine and and buzz stuff like that
it's not actually usually coils
sometimes it's a number of other
components but it's being called coil
wine by the industry because just kind
of a catch-all term but we've cut it
down to almost zero this system right
now is running even though there's four
or two ATS in it it's running only three
of them in crossfire because one of them
fried itself overnight so that's
probably our fault
but anyway it's running three systems
and crossfire you just say that it's
probably our fault yeah it's I think
someone zapped it when they opened the
side panel but uh so one of them is not
actually running it's just there for
cosmetic purposes like the fourth sack
on the Titanic poor metaphor for
immunity but anyway this is a running
three to 80s and it's running a six core
processor everything is running full
load fur mark of prime95 is running
crazy we're doing about six hundred
watts of output right now so it's only
about you know kind of a little between
a third and a half of its max load and
it's doing no fan at all right now so
you're doing 600 watts completely
fanless li3 to 80s and a fully pegged
processor
x79 sandy bridge-e fanless lee so that's
kind of one of the nice features of a
1500 watt power supply is yeah it's
expensive you have that Headroom for 15
watts but even if you're running what is
a ridiculous system that almost nobody I
know would actually build you can run
that famously so pretty nice setup for
the power
very cool thank you very much George for
taking the time as always it's an
absolute pleasure and thank you very
much for showing us this surprisingly
interesting when it really caught my eye
when I walked in the room alright guys
don't miss any of our CES 2014 coverage
remember our trip to the show this year
is powered by NCI XCOM as well as our
other to show sponsors Corsair and
Western Digital so huge thanks to all of
those guys for allowing us to be here
and see their products and talk about
their products for them imagine them
wanting us to be here and do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
