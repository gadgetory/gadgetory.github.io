unboxing of the ZOTAC GeForce GTX 570 so
this is a reference board which means
that we're gonna find pretty much the
same specs as every other GeForce GTX
570 on the market so let's go over the
basics of what all of that means first
of all we have 1.2 8 gigabytes of video
memory so that is slightly less than the
GeForce GTX 580 although that's not the
only way that it is slightly reduced
from the spec of the GTX 580 I mean
given the price difference
you'd have to expect there's a couple
things that are not quite as good first
of all we have a 320 bit memory
interface and we also have a slightly
fewer functional units so that is CUDA
cores on this card versus the 580 now
we've gone full support for invidious
technologies including cuda physx sli 3d
vision surround all of that good stuff
and ZOTAC you get a lifetime warranty in
the USA and canada and i'm actually not
sure what their warranty is in some of
the other territories although i know
that we do have viewers from those
places so i wish i could tell you guys
maybe there will be some details about
that inside out here actually why don't
we have a look at what ZOTAC has to say
about themselves on the back DirectX 11
we've got support for end gaming play in
3d I guess this is stuff we've pretty
much covered already
oh yeah power supply requirements I
don't think I talked about that before
looks like we don't have anything on
this side mm-hmm nothing let's see over
here okay power supply minimum 550 water
greater power supply with at least 38
amps on the 12 volt rail and all of the
other like here here's something I don't
get AMD Athlon XP Class processor or
higher show me an Athlon XP motherboard
with the PCI Express slot yeah good luck
that's sort of dumb since you can't even
install this on one like that why would
they have that on the minimum
I don't get it okay let's have a look at
what we've got inside in terms of
accessories so first of all I think
we're gonna find some stuff under there
hey cool we get a game Prince of Persia
The Forgotten fans so a permanent
internet connection is required to play
this game I actually know nothing about
this game I'm just gonna make sure
there's no like cereals on the back of
it or anything that you guys can pilfer
all right so there you go you get a game
cool you get an installation CD as well
as a case sticker so I'll throw away the
installation CD download the latest
drivers from Nvidia calm you get a
little warning sticker please allow the
graphics card to cool after operation
before removing it from your system okay
then we also get a little coupon code
thing so you can get a couple discounts
on be reveal for sharpening your
high-definition videos as well as Nero
vision extra excellent and then a couple
other things that I guess work with
GeForce CUDA all right then we have and
extend oh hey here's the warranty
details so there you are five years
warranty Europe Middle East and a pack
lifetime warranty in USA Mexico Canada
and Latin America all right user's
manual probably telling you how to
install it how to install the drivers
all that good stuff not gonna dwell on
that for too long here we have
accessories so we've got two molex to
6-pin PCI II adapters we have one HTML
this is interesting mini HDMI to HDMI
but it's like at a 90 degree angle here
so look at that
I wonder why they've gone and done that
so here hold on now I have to now I have
to figure out why they've opted to
include one that's shaped like this so
in a typical case you would install it
like that
okay so it'd be this way and then the
HDMI comes up this way I guess it's so
that you don't interfere with something
like right here above the the top of the
PCI bracket or something interesting
alright maybe there's a reason like that
would make it fit better with some cases
that they've gone with that right angle
adapter and then finally we've got a DVI
to VGA adapter a little please do
yourself a favor if you don't already
have a DVI monitor and you're buying
this graphics card please
get one all right so ZOTAC sticker
design features they're like ZOTAC guy
and he seems to be meditating with his
glowing eyes and as well as the zotac
line showing that they do have a
heartbeat
apparently camera man has lost interest
in the sticker so we're gonna go around
to the back of the card where you'll
find not a whole lot to look at there
then we will move to the top of the card
where you will find here I'll let me
just flip this over where you'll find a
ZOTAC sticker as well as little GeForce
branding as well as two 6-pin PCI II
power connectors we've also bought a
ventilation hole here so you are going
to be exhausting just a little bit of
air into your case but the majority of
it is going to go out the back through
these exhaust vents here we've got two
DVI ports as well as one mini HDMI port
which we've talked about a fair bit
already and then we will also find two
sli connectors compatible with 2-way as
well as 3-way SLI on the back of the
board you can see that it is identical
in every way to the GTX 580 PCB
including even solder points for the
extra two pins on the eight pin power
connector on the 580 as well as solder
points for the extra memory that the GTX
580 has located here so we've got a
standard PCI Express 16 X graphics card
connection at the bottom and I think
that covers pretty much everything there
is to say about the ZOTAC GeForce GTX
570 so in summary with ZOTAC you get
your extra game you get the lifetime
warranty and I believe they also have I
believe they have a pretty good support
system with their live chat thing
although I don't think they've mentioned
that on the box anywhere but if you
check out their site they've actually
got like you can chat with a customer
service representative at any time and
they were quite responsive when I tried
it so don't forget to subscribe to Linus
