length comparison between the gtx 570
and the gtx 580 so i have to msi cards
here and i'm going to show you how they
compare in terms of length well audience
first of all why don't we have a look at
the all new gtx 570 and we will discover
that it is 10 and a half inches long and
then we will look at the gtx 580 to
discover that it is 10 and a half inches
long so this reveals something very
interesting about the gtx 570 and that
is that it actually uses exactly the
same cooler almost I I noticed one small
difference between the coolers check
this out guys okay so this is the 570
see how the aluminum fin comes up a
little bit closer to the vent compared
to the gtx 580 I don't even know if you
guys can see that here I'll give you
sort of a better perspective on it can
you can you tell in the camera okay it's
hard to tell in the camera but they do
both use a vapor chamber cooler however
it looks like the positioning of the
fins or maybe the number of fins is
slightly different so there there's a
bit of intrigue for you alright other
than that we have two 6-pin versus a
6-pin and an 8-pin pcie power connector
and then you're going to find more
differences on the back because even
though they use here look at it this way
even though they use the same PCB
there's actually fewer things soldered
to the gtx 570 PCB so you can see where
the RAM chips are installed there's all
kinds of little components soldered onto
the back of the RAM chip so the gtx 570
which is here has that but not here so
there's actually blank spots where they
could have potentially installed more
RAM chips used a higher bin GPU one that
has more active functional units and
that would be a 580 pretty much as long
as they put an 8 pin power connector on
it so they're very very similar cards
basically you've just got lower memory
bandwidth on the 570 less overall memory
and then you've got a slightly cut down
or lower Bend GPU and if you're not sure
what i mean by binned or bidding
you should check out the NCIX tech tips
episode where we explained the process
of bidding and how that works in the
electronics industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
