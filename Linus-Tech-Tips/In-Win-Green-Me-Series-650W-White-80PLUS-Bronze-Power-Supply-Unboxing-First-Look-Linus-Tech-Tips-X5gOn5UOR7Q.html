the inn win greenie series 650 watt
power supply and the whole thing with
this power supply is the eco
friendliness so it uses 80 plus bronze
efficiency in order to be efficient it
has three year warranty comes with one
hundred percent recyclable packaging
100% recyclable packaging and it also
has hold on how long and see if they say
it again did you really only twice only
twice look at that okay one hundred
percent recyclable packaging dc-to-dc
design it helps it achieve that
efficiency high quality Japanese
capacitors a strict voltage regulation
plus run is five percent how strict
values but given that it's like more of
a value-oriented product i guess that's
fine well within spec anyway active
power factor correction high-efficiency
smart thermal control the balance noise
and cooling patented 4-pin molex easy
swap connectors we'll have to have a
look at those multi protection functions
so over voltage over power under voltage
/ current etc and for 12 volt rails each
maxing out at 25 amps with up to six
hundred and forty-eight watts of the
total 650 watt capacity available on the
12 volt rail that's actually really nice
comes in a variety of capacities
including 550 650 and 750 and greenie is
more than a product it is a state of
mind look at that however you're like
valuable thing showing you all the
connectors and whatnots in the wide
variety of different languages alright
here comes the recyclable packaging
cardboard going on here oh actually
looks quite nice look at that felt like
a white casing on it my casings are good
lots of people are doing like white and
black bean builds these days
hey Cody oh hold on I don't know if the
silica gel is recyclable I think it
might be absolutely no all right comes
with a couple velcro cable ties four
screws for installing it power cable and
let's check out the power supply itself
so let's go ahead and hold this wire off
here so this is not a modular power
supply however modular interfaces do
tend to reduce efficiency however
slightly so if they were going for the
most efficient family planet-friendly
possible solution I can see how they
would want to go with fixed connected
cables as I mentioned before it's about
a white housing this is where you'll
find all the information that we already
found on the outside of the box the back
has your standard honeycomb mesh no
voltage input switch to the PFC although
there is an on-off switch as well as
your power in 120 millimeter cooling fan
is found on the bottom and it looks like
a pretty beefy fan actually you okay
it's got some heft to it as well so
let's have a look at the included
connectors it's got a 24-pin connector
not too long not too short you can break
away the extra four pins and install it
into a 20 pin motherboard if you
honestly still have a 20 pin motherboard
that you're buying a new power supply
for although I mean I really don't see
the wisdom in that you've got a 4 plus 4
so you can either use it as an 8-pin or
you can use it as a 4-pin if you still
have a four-point no I'm just kidding I
know some new motherboards still have
four pins like ITX boards and stuff like
that okay moving right along we've got
two PCIe 6 plus 2 pin connectors so you
can plug that into your 8-pin pci
express graphics card or if you still
have a graphics card that only takes a
second option key I know lots of them
have that moving right along we've got
one molex harness which has three molex
connectors as well as a floppy connector
if you still have something that uses a
floppy connector and then we've also got
six SATA connectors on two separate
harnesses thus leaving on this is
actually reasonably high quality that's
better than I would have
did so you actually can't see the color
of the wires very much through it
compared to what I've seen on competing
products from even the likes of someone
like like entech with their earthwatts
you know green oriented products so I
think that pretty much wraps it up thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
