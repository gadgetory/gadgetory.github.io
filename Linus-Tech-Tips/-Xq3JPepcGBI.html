for sending us here to pax east 2016 if
you want to see it all their stuff check
them out in the link of the video
description down below here at the
steelseries booth we're checking out two
things a keyboard and a headset the
headset is their Siberia 350s it's a USB
headset that works on PC Mac or ps4 and
that is fine it's 2016 play on whatever
you want we have RGB illumination which
is controllable in their software so you
can make it do whatever the heck you
want they have soft memory foam earpads
which are absolutely pretty good if you
have a glasses they won't be super
hardcore and like push the glasses into
the side of your head or anything they
have 50 millimeter drivers and they have
DTS headphone X surround that's all fine
and dandy they look generally like what
you would expect from a SteelSeries
headset something like a Siberia v2 or
v200 but they are a little bit different
they still have the like retractable
Mike that you guys are all probably used
to be the noise cancelling retractable
mic so just so you didn't know a headset
has to have a mic if they were
headphones there would be no mic so
small bit of information check out tech
quickie if you want more of that moving
on to the keyboard it's a little boring
but it gets it gets a spot anyways it's
called the apex m500 it is a standard
full keyboard with cherry MX red
switches blue backlighting and some
cable routing on the back so you can
have the cable come out in the middle to
the left side or to the right hand side
and markets for around ninety nine
dollars nothing earth-shattering nothing
new but may be interesting if you're
looking for something in that price
range alright guys thanks for watching
