us today this is the XFX 850 watt Black
Edition power supply I can't actually
see the writing here it's like really
cool the way they've done the box anyway
this is a modular 80 plus silver nvidia
sli certified power supply and it is XFX
is first power supply ever so we're
going to start with getting it out of
the sleeving here yeah there we go take
the sleeve off so then the way they
package did is actually kind of kind of
unique here it's a two-part box so we're
pulling out pull up the tab you can pull
it up from the other side so there's the
unit itself I love the way it's
presented here but we'll get to that in
a minute after I show you all the juicy
accessories if i can get it open yeah
there we go so you pull out the tab this
way using the little hook open it up and
then in here we will find a baggie with
all of our modular cables on proceeding
okay so inside the one side we've got
what do we have here okay so we've got a
molex to two floppy adapter then we've
got a lot of okay one two three so for
modular SATA cables with two to three
cables by our two to three connectors /
cable and in the other side I guess this
is where we're going to find yet so here
we've got 16 plus 2 pin PCI Express and
then we've got probably another 1 i'm
assuming ah yeah there we go another six
plus two pin PCI Express and then three
molex cables so that's it for our
modular cables now let's get got a
conveyor belt your so we can move that
along now let's get the power supply
itself open here's our user guide so
here you can see that they tell you some
of the key features including that this
power supply uses a single powerful 12
volt rail as opposed to multi multi rail
design so
here we're gonna get this box oh yeah so
here we found find the power cord and
this is like a super beefy thick power
cord it's like yeah really thick and
then we've got four mounting screws for
the power supply put that aside and last
but not least we have the black edition
850 watt itself and this is a
sharp-looking unit so you can see you've
got one hundred and thirty-five
millimeter fan it's like a glowy sort of
green color and then let's have a look
at the I guess we'll show the side and
then the back of the unit itself so
that's where you've got like an XFX logo
there's your power button there's your
power plug input and then on the other
side you can see that's oh here I'm
going to flip this around you can see
all the info above the power supply
itself again another label there's your
80 plus logo and on the top is just a
plain black and then here is your
modular interface more XFX logos they've
really dress this up actually quite a
lot so this is where you plug in your
two PCI Express and here's where you can
choose to plug in molex or say that
connectors as you see fit now a lot of
modular power supplies these days have
some native connectors because they
figure well you're not running your
system without these things anyway so we
might as well just attach them so here
we've got our 24-pin connector nice long
cable on that as well should work really
well in a bottom mounted power supply a
case here we've got 26 plus 2 pin
connectors so you up to four total and
then oh this is really cool so you've
got two eps 8 pin connectors so a 4 + 4
+ + 8 pin that means you can run boards
like the p55 classified that we already
unboxed natively just this power supply
unit so anyway thank you for checking
out my video blog on the XFX 850 watt
power supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
