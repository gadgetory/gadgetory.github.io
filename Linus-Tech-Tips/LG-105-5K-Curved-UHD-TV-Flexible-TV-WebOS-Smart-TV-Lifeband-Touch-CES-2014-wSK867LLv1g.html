brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital we're kicking things off
at the LG booth with a couple of major
themes of the show overall so one of
which being curved TVs LG is showing off
the world's largest curved Ultra HD TV
now one of the other common themes here
is 4k but not to be outdone by what
everyone else is doing LG has delivered
a 21 by 9 5 K curved TV now to be clear
guys this is absolutely massive this is
a hundred and five inches diagonally
which to put it in perspective is if you
play basketball and you're trying to put
the ball in the basket from the
free-throw line you would have to
actually throw it about the distance of
the diagonal width of this TV now the
objective of curved TVs is of course to
enhance the image quality by having
every part of the screen being equal
distance from your eyes compared to the
more traditional flat TV style now you
might be looking at this going okay well
this is like space-age technology can we
expect to buy one in 2020 if you have
the funds and they're not talking about
pricing yet you could actually buy one
of these this year they are releasing it
in 2014 all right so let's move on to
something that is a little bit more
space-age now if the objective of a
curved TV is to have the viewing angles
be absolutely optimal regardless of how
far away you are from the TV then you're
going to need something a little bit
different this my friends is the world's
first flexible curved TV now that's not
to say that it's flexible in terms of
somewhere at their manufacturing plant
there today it's manufactured out of
some sort of you know flexible OLED
screen and they came in and they put it
on a solid background no the idea is
that with a remote control you can
actually take this phenomenally thin 4k
OLED TV and adjust it on the fly for the
optimal picture quality we have no idea
when this is coming but what I can tell
you guys is having the privilege of
being able to stand right next to it it
still looks absolutely amazing
the problem with the best image quality
in the world and the most advanced
technology is that quite frankly my aunt
bless her heart
I hope she's not watching simply can't
use it now LG acquired webOS from HP
earlier in 2013 and we are now seeing
the fruits of that acquisition in the
form of webOS integrated directly with
their new Smart TVs now there are a few
advantages here that are sort of on a
more granular level but the overarching
message is simplicity it is much much
simpler to use than existing Smart TV
systems which quite frankly my aunt and
even my mother who's slightly more
technical than my aunt also can't handle
so number one is the launcher down here
you can launch different apps in much
the same way that you would on something
like a tablet or smartphone which makes
sense because webOS like was on tablets
before so you know right - obvious you
can look at sort of your recent
applications so we can fire up a web
browser here go to cnn.com you can
switch back using the recent application
feature to the blu-ray disc that was
playing before that will take a few
seconds though guys just because of HDMI
is handshakes it process that has to
occur here it's also got now this is
really cool what they're calling input
assist so there's a blu-ray player down
here unfortunately I can't demo this one
live but if you plug in something like
an Xbox 360 the idea is that you plug it
in and it goes okay boom you've got an
Xbox 360 we're going to go ahead and add
you something a little icon in the
launcher here so that you don't even
have to like really think about it
anymore HDMI one HDMI two that's too
complicated for my mother in my aunt so
LG was specifically trying to address
that for me the last thing is the live
menu the fact that you don't have to
navigate away to a separate menu
structure with a static background you
can actually keep your content playing
in the background and navigate all of
your Smart TVs features next up we've
got my first hands-on time with the LG G
flex this is the world's first curved
smartphone I mean let's go through the
regular standard phone stuffer so it has
a six inch plastic OLED display which I
guess isn't that standard considering
that's the largest pio LED display on
the market at this time it has a 3500
milliamp hour battery which I guess also
isn't unexceptional is exceptional
because that happens to be curved as
well it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon
800 processor it's got however much
storage you decide you want based on
what your needs are and it's got a lock
button as well as volume control it's on
the back of the phone I guess now this
is really that standard
so what's LG trying to do here by doing
a bunch of non-standard stuff with their
phones they're trying to make the
interface and the way that you interact
with it more natural so there's a couple
things that this does number one is a
curved phone puts the microphone closer
to your mouth so sound quality can be
improved number two is when you're
enjoying content this is sort of the
year of curved TVs they want you to be
able to enjoy that curve to display
experience even when you're just
watching videos on your smartphone now
in terms of carrying the thing around
does it fit in your hand does it create
a little bit more comfortably in spite
of the six-inch size I would actually go
as far as to say yeah it kind of does
already you can really tell it's just
it's a more natural position for your
hand I mean electronics in the past have
been flat not because they should be
necessarily but out of necessity and one
other feature they have they call the
the the the doesn't make your bum fall
asleep as often as bad leafy add notes
what they say is it fits more
comfortably in your back pocket and more
naturally when you put it in there
because of its flexibility now you might
worry you might go okay well I don't put
my phone in my back pocket because I'm
worried about it being damaged as a as a
you know as a straight phone maybe I'm
not exactly the you know the curvature
of my glutes isn't quite like this I'm
still worried about breaking it don't
worry the Flex is not only for the
curved nature of the display but also
for the flexibility of the display you
can actually curve it back pretty much
to a straight position without damaging
the phone and then speaking of
durability this is a feature that's been
getting a lot of airtime guys is the
fact that the back is self-healing no
you're not going to be able to take an
ice pick to it but if you put it in your
pocket with your keys or whatever else
we've pretty much started taking Gorilla
Glass for granted but the plastic backs
on these phones tend to develop micro
scratches very very quickly not so much
with this one you leave it for you know
15 minutes half an hour particularly in
a warm environment and those micro
scratches will disappear almost
completely closing things out at the LG
booth we've got the life band touch now
the unique thing about this particular
fitness
wearable is that unlike others where you
have to link them to something like a
smartphone like whether it's an iOS or
an Android smartphone din order to
monitor your stats particularly on a
daily basis you don't have to with this
one it operates completely standalone
it's got both an Excel Tim etre so you
know it can track things like your steps
your calorie count but it can also even
help you train for things like marathons
now in order to turn it on you just go
ahead and flick your wrist there you go
in the display lights up this helps
maintain a very solid multi day battery
life which is excellent when you compare
it to other sort of more SmartWatch
feature-rich devices which is something
I actually prefer I'm using a pebble
myself right now and I find that having
a low-power display even if I lose some
of the extra fancy features is
definitely a plus now what can you do
with that touch screen display well you
can change your music tracks you can
accept phone calls and all that kind of
stuff
if you have it linked to a smart phone
but other than that you can use it to
track things like your calorie
consumption that day and you can set
little achievements and goals for
yourself and it's just generally use it
to enable a more healthy lifestyle now
from a pure sort of okay I'm going to
wear this everyday perspective is quite
comfortable and it does a few useful
things but if you're actually going for
an intensive workout and you want even
more stats you can plug in the included
earphones that have a battery-powered
Bluetooth link right here and this will
give you obviously the ability to listen
to music but also the ability to monitor
your heart rate and the oxygenation of
your blood so I think we're pretty much
done here guys I think they actually
need these so we're going to wrap things
up thanks for checking out our coverage
of the LG booth here at CES 2014 don't
forget our trip to the show with powered
by NCI XCOM your source for great
technology selection and service as well
as course our memory and Western Digital
without those guys we wouldn't be able
to be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
