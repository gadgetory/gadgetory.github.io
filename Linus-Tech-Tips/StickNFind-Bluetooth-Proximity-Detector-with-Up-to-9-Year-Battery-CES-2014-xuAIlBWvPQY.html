brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital so we're here at stick
and find it's actually the last possible
minute of the show but I needed to run
back and see these guys because they
have something that I personally think
is really cool now we've seen little
devices such as things you can put on
your keychain to notify you when you
move away from your phone and stuff like
that but what I haven't seen before is
something that is able to achieve this
kind of range and this kind of battery
life so this one right here is the micro
beacon it's it has a point eight year
battery and a 50 foot range next up we
have the standard stick and find beacon
it has a one-year battery and a hundred
foot range when you step up to the pro
you get water resistance you also get
see I'm totally cheating here a hundred
foot range and a three year battery and
then when you step right up to the
extend you get a nine year battery water
resistance as well and then I believe
that's pretty much that's the advantage
okay so nine you're better so this is
the kind of thing if you're
absent-minded you always leave your car
in the parking lot this is what I'd put
on it it's that small it's that small we
can do b-roll it's okay it's that small
and it has a nine year battery then the
last one and oh yeah 200 foot range on
that one as well the last one this is
the rechargeable unit this is the HQ
beacon and the battery doesn't last for
a phenomenally long time and before you
have to recharge it but what this one
does is it works up to around 3,000 feet
using a combination of Bluetooth and GPS
technology so it can be configured to do
things like show you the last place that
you left a device that had this stuck to
it so when it goes out of range I can go
oh crap and it can drop a pin on a map
you can go ahead and see where all your
stuff was where you last saw it you can
also set it up to notify you in the
event that you walk away from something
so luggage keys phones things like that
would be very very relevant here but the
application that I actually see as most
relevant to me is putting it on
something like a beloved pet or child I
didn't suggest that second one actually
pet pet let's just say pet and using it
to find it so I'm going to be the
beloved pet for our little demonstration
here and I'm going to use the standard
beacon and I'm gonna have my lovely
assistant hold up a phone in front of
the
camera while I walk away so here we go
guys I am walking away with it
each one is what Bator here wonderful
sense of people like yeah range
different buttery lies
thank you very much so once it reaches
about 98% signal strength you know your
game of hot and cold is pretty much done
now unfortunately it works as as a game
of hot and cold as opposed to you know
dropping pins on the radar exactly
around you but to me the most
fascinating thing about it is the
battery life because you can have all
the great technology in the world that
you want I mean I think something like
the Samsung Galaxy gear is a great
example of this great piece of
technology battery lasts for like a few
hours so you're constantly tethered to a
wall socket this one not so much you
said it you forget it you remember like
once a year to change your cat's battery
and then it's all good now if I didn't
feel like playing hot and cold there are
other options as well I could have
simply clicked page it it's got a little
LED on it it's got a little noise that
it makes makes it a little bit easier to
find
I saw the LED a second ago where'd that
Ellie do you go wow the LED goes off at
the beginning anyway we'll do b-roll of
that thank you guys very much for
checking out our booth coverage of the
stick and find remember the applications
of this technology go beyond just
finding something you can use them for
things like you know in-store navigation
for example if a retailer were to deploy
these 9-year batteries all over their
store you can actually like navigate the
store and go to clothing just by
following around the little little
beacons beacons cuz you can label them
wallet or you can label them like you
know bathroom or whatever the case may
be imagine a store that never had to
direct people to the bathroom anymore
anyway guys remember our trip to the
show this year is powered by NCI XCOM
your source for great technology
selection and service as well as course
our memory and Western Digital without
those guys there's no way we would have
been able to be here bringing you this
content so thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
