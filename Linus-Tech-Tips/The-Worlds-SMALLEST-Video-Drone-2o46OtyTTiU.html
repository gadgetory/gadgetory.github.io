Pro which is like this super tiny
foldable drone and we got these like
wicked first person view goggles for
them so it can be like flying through
the air you're over the treetops but
that whole experience cost like over a
thousand dollars surely there's got to
be something a little bit less expensive
enter the videos HD from Eric's drones
it's even smaller than the Mavic and the
goggles with the quadcopter and the
remote comes in at less than $100 but
can the experience compare we're
thinking probably not but let's see by
how much
gee fuel is the sugar free alternative
energy drink formula that helps to
maintain focus during long work days and
gaming sessions use offer code Lynas to
save 40% for a limited time alright so
there's actually three ways to fly the
videos HD we're gonna start with the
good old-fashioned 2.4 gigahertz remote
up down and out to start the motors okay
that's what I did okay that's pretty
painless that's not too bad you got some
built in trim this might be the only
kind of drone that you can fly without
some kind of certification and or
authorization from the local law flight
authorities I mean I can think of worse
fates but actually the flight of this
thing is pretty stable compared to uh
two other little tiny drones that I've
flown in the past wait for it oh I did a
flip
wait wait oh okay alright another trick
is if I push this button we can cycle
between three different speeds oh it's a
lot faster now how about now can you
track that okay you're tracking that you
track of that we're gonna be I'm gonna
be out alright there's a durability test
for you so in summary pretty cool but
what five six minute flight time it's
not about right but this is not the
whole experience instructions unclear
dick stuck in propeller that video
stream actually looks pretty good I mean
look at that that's that's not not bad
at all look we can see that guy shaking
his booties or whatever we got that back
there Pella fella
that's my new nickname for you Pella
fella rhymes so what we're looking at
right now is the delay between a drone
movement and a change in the camera now
my initial reaction to that is that
actually looks pretty good but we've got
some heavy compression artifacts when
the drone is doing anything other than
staying stock stark still well ok I was
pretty sure that this was gonna happen
but I do not I do not like the on-screen
controls very much at all I feel like
I'm not really in control it's coming
after me oh no no no okay just come back
okay drawing thing drawing a path there
it goes it's following the path no no
what I'm really interested in here is
the VR mode we slide this baby in here
and look at this quality construction
hey actually that looks not bad you can
adjust your your peepers a little bit
there get a nice clear image and we're
gonna go ahead and pair to this bad boy
oh the delay oh I just took off oh is it
close to me oh bit me in the finger
okay it's behind my head I see that I'm
gonna move really slow I'm gonna move
really whoa what the heck dude I'm not
gonna try and land in your mouth that's
uh that's for our own so conclusion time
then pretty darn stable flight for an
inexpensive drone definitely more video
capability than other little tiny drones
like this which is pretty rad but in
terms of the fpv experience I probably
wouldn't spend the extra twenty bucks
even though twenty bucks is uh quite a
value for for such a robustly built a
goggle thing there FreshBooks cloud
