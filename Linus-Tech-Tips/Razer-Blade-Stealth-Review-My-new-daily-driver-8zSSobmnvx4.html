has awed me with its astonishingly
compact design fantastic aesthetic and
superb build quality which puts the
Razer Blade stealth 2016 the product I'm
evaluating today in a somewhat unique
position one of being on the inside
looking in because I'll be deciding on a
new daily driver notebook before this
video is over and whether Razer wins or
loses Razer is going to lose which will
also cause Razer to win meaning that
Razer will also lose which okay the joke
sold down roll the intro
intel has brought ddr4 to the mainstream
with their core i7 6700 K processor
check out the link in the video
description to learn more I think the
smart thing to do here would be to begin
with a physical tour which is easy
because Razer has taken just about a
pure if it ain't broke don't fix an
approach in this regard the top of the
machine is black with only a Razer logo
the illumination of which can be
disabled now if you want a nice touch
and a couple of accent ridges to adorn
it just like its bigger brother the
bottom has two rubber feet the rear
taller than the front to Incline the
keyboard gently toward the user and a
couple of air intakes just like it's
bigger brother and if I looked hard
enough I could probably find a dozen
such similarities but you didn't come
here for similarities you came here for
differences so let's focus in on those
for a moment here the discreet left and
right click buttons under the touchpad
have been replaced by a gesture aware
click pad this is a change that would
bother me if they haven't implemented it
so well no issues in two-handed
operation and palm rejection was solid
so good on you the speakers are both
narrower and closer to the edge to
salvage as much room as possible for the
surprisingly spacious keyboard which has
been completely overhauled with RGB
lighting more on that later the big
change though is that the blade stealth
is significantly thinner and lighter
than the blade 14 shaving 0.7 inches
diagonally off the screen size and about
0.75 of a kilogram off the weight making
it only 2.75 pounds so light enough then
that I can pretty much not tell whether
it's in my four and a half pound
backpack or not something that I can't
say about my daily driver blade 14 and
it manages to do all of this while
maintaining a very respectable mix of Io
Apple should take notes on the right is
a USB 3.0 port and an HDMI 1.4 output
then on the left is a three and a half
millimeter headphone microphone combo
jack another USB 3.0 port and a USB
type-c connector that handles
Thunderbolt USB 3.0 DisplayPort and
charging duties through the compact
included AC adapter this is the port
that will be used
to enable the theoretically hot
swappable although I did manage to break
it at the demo at CES external dedicated
graphics card housing that they're
calling the razor core which I will be
covering in an upcoming separate video
today though I'm focused on the blade
stealth as an ultrabook
because that's what it is while the slim
exterior definitely hints at what makes
the blade stealth so different from
razors previous mobile devices all of
which adhered to that for gamers by
gamers slogan that they've got displayed
so prominently on their website the
inside of this machine reveals outright
that it is not a gaming device so
regardless of which model you buy then
I've got the 1199 256 gig quad HD skew
but I spent most of my time with the
$9.99 base model the one with the white
vinyl skin from D brand here you'll be
getting a few things an Intel Core i7
6500 u 2.5 gigahertz base 3.1 gigahertz
boost hyper-threaded dual core processor
with Intel HD graphics 520 yes my
friends are onboard graphics and eight
gigs of non upgradable soldered dual
channel low-power ddr3 then depending on
which trim level you opt for you can get
anywhere from a hundred and twenty eight
gigs to 512 gigs of unspecified m dot
two nvme storage on mine it was a
samsung PM 951 so about as basic as it
gets for an nvme drive with sequential
writes limited on the 128 gig version to
the rated 150 megabytes or so thanks to
its TLC NAND do note however that I
would take a basic native PCIe Drive
over a Saito on any day of the week the
other user configurable spec is the
screen which I guess leads me to one of
the things that frustrates me about
Razer systems what if I don't mind the
2560 by 1440 touchscreen sRGB color
space display it's the one I've got here
and frankly everything about it looks
fantastic at thirteen point three inches
contrast brightness and sharpness are
great so what if I want that instead of
the Adobe RGB 4k monitor who's in
advantages while tangible won't benefit
me personally and who's higher
resolution will drain my battery faster
but I also want a 512 gig SSD I will
need to upgrade it after the fact
although all of this is irrelevant if
the experience of using the blade
stealth isn't a good one and you
shouldn't buy one anyway so how is that
well for a thousand dollar machine the
6500 you processor with its 90% usage
while installing applications and CPU
bottleneck while testing the maximum USB
3 transfer speed with screen recording
running in the background might still
not be the right solution for me
personally but if your mobile computing
needs are a little lighter than mine
they have nailed a lot of stuff here the
45 watt hour battery turned in a solid
result at PC marks recommended
brightness setting although it should be
noted if you want to use it outside it
goes a lot brighter than that and I
didn't realize how much I missed my
touchscreen until I did my XPS 15 review
without one which you can check out here
by the way a one finger hinge is really
hard to do on a device this light
without having it feel flimsy but they
nailed that and Razer speaker camera and
microphone quality continues to
embarrass their competitors attention
industry notebooks are communication
devices this stuff is important so good
on Razer for at least maintaining their
above average standard here which leads
us back finally again to the keyboard
far and away the biggest departure from
previous Razer notebooks and everyone
else for that matter the layout with two
function keys six full rows a great size
considering the screen size and a
sensible key cap font this time around
is I am Oh perfect except for the half
height up and down arrows those still
bother me and it's still fully
reconfigurable with remapping and macros
using synapse but now it's RGB as well
so you can actually change things like
color you can add camp patterns and
effects to it you can change the effects
and patterns for different applications
including games with both first and
third party tools and just generally
personalize the device in a way that
hasn't been done on a laptop before
frickin awesome there are however some
trade offs the new backlighting does not
illuminate the whole key the way the old
type did so while the function row
lights up when it's activated the actual
functions themselves are not easy to see
in the dark and more importantly the
feel of the switches has been altered
very significantly
they are quieter which some people will
appreciate but they are also less crisp
feeling than I'm used to
something that I sincerely hope does not
carry over to the new blade when I
review it shortly to be clear it didn't
slow me down much but it was not as
pleasing to type on something that I
would personally consider more important
for a Productivity minded as opposed to
a gaming device leading us then to the
conclusion of today's video the blade
stealth takes the ID and the build
quality of the blade 14 which has gotten
me wow that's a cool black MacBook more
than a few times at airport security
checkpoints strips out everything gamer
about it including the video card and
even the bizarro land key cap font in a
clear effort to target the mainstream
and slashes the price in half I mean who
saw that one coming from Razer of all
people but what does that mean then
would I buy one not until ultrabooks can
have quad-core CPUs and 16 gigs of RAM
what would I recommend one to someone in
search of an ultrabook today you're damn
right I would this is a very compelling
answer to the MacBook Air something even
Apple doesn't have right now since they
seem to be on a we don't need ports kick
so good work Razer this is a great
machine especially for the price
speaking of good work let's give a good
work to our friends over at D brand who
no longer are limited to phones and game
consoles yes my friends they now offer
skins for Mac and PC laptops including
the blade stealth so if you're kind of
going oh wow gee Linus that white one is
really cool how do I get my hands on
some of that or what if I wanted a
different color head over to the link in
the video just
dbrand calm and you can use their
configurator to try out all kinds of
different combinations of different
colors and textures of skins to get your
device looking exactly the way you want
it their skins fit like a freaking glove
like seriously no one would know looking
at this that you've put a vinyl skin on
it as opposed to it shipping out of the
factory like that and they're affordable
and they ship worldwide so check it out
at the link in the video description if
you want to make your device more
scratch resistant if you want to make it
look cooler and you don't want to spend
a ton of money doing it they're the guys
