gets featured on the when show bill
blogs the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it I've been curious about the pebbles
since launch and very recently I bit the
bullet I bought one and it arrived in
this eco-friendly packaging that is
completely recyclable and really doesn't
contain a whole lot so once you open it
up all you're going to find is the
pebble smartwatch
and in my case I chose regrettably the
orange color so coupled with the sort of
cheap feeling rubber strap and the
bright color and plastic construction it
really does feel kind of like a child's
toy as opposed to a serious tool that I
spend one hundred and fifty dollars on
but don't worry it's available in six
different colors of which orange is
probably the most ridiculous and then it
comes with a magnetic charging cable it
does not come with an AC adapter though
so you'll have to plug it into one that
you already own pick one up at the store
or plug it into a computer now the
magnetic charging cable I'll show you
guys how it works here so it just clips
on to the to the SmartWatch like that
boom not too strong not too weak is a
bit of a double-edged sword so as much
as I hate microUSB and it can just go
eat a turd because I hate it and it's
fragile
this is not necessarily optimal either
because it comes with one if you ever
need a replacement one you're probably
going to have to order it online and as
we discovered when we tried to do the
unboxing the other day if you don't have
it you can't just run around and find a
replacement one very very easily you
have to go and actually find that cable
so I recommend not losing it however I
to love that it's magnetic and it's not
going to break so with that out of the
way let's get into the physicality of
the pebble so I did mention it's a
little bit cheesy don't worry there are
things you can do so you could order a
different color you can get aftermarket
watch faces for it you can get
aftermarket watch straps from any store
that carries standard replaceable watch
straps so you can actually customize it
to your heart's content but you don't
have to out of the box on the left hand
side there is one button this turns the
backlight on and also serves as a back
button when you're navigating through
the menus on the right hand side you've
got up and down within the menus as well
as confirm these up-and-down ones if
you're
inside the menus will rotate through
your different clock phases that are
available it comes with three ones by
default but you can totally download all
the different clock phases you want and
to take advantage of that awesome
upgradeable functionality that it has I
do want to very briefly show you guys
the kinds of options that are in the
menu so music control is a big one
forward back and play pause this is one
that I find myself using a ton because
when you have your headphones connected
to your phone and it's in your pocket
what's more convenient bloop-bloop on
your wrist or pulling out your phone and
manually selecting a track do it undoing
your lock screen
absolutely fantastic I'd say it's worth
the cost of admission just for that set
alarms watches you've got some settings
in here Bluetooth display yeah nothing
else in here that's really that
interesting the music control is awesome
however there's a great deal of
customized ability and we'll get into
that more in just a moment here so the
first thing you're going to download
when you get a pebble is the pebble app
which has one button and one button only
so you press connect and as long as
bluetooth is enabled on your phone it is
going to walk you through a very simple
menu it was easy to set up the pebble
also offers excellent compatibility so
there's a few issues with some Samsung
smart phones but unlike the Galaxy gear
it is pretty much universally compatible
with any Android phone rather than being
locked down to a particular vendor aside
from Twitter notifications showing up on
the SmartWatch I had everything going
within about five or ten minutes more on
that in a moment you've also got
settings up here so this allows you to
configure what you want it to notify you
about so calls SMS message messages
calendar
it supports Facebook as well as Google
Hangouts the one thing that I'd say oh
emails of course the one thing I'd say
is really essential and doesn't support
is Twitter but don't worry there's a way
around that music you can actually tell
it which of your music apps you want it
to control so you're not just locked
into something like a default music app
and that is pretty much it guys so
that's where we get into other apps so
you can get like free caddy which tells
you how far away you are from the hole
on like thousands of different golf
courses RunKeeper
which keeps track of your runs no not in
your pants like out on the street you go
for runs and tells you like how fast you
went and cool stuff like that and then
pebble notifier this is an essential app
so what you can do is you can tell it
okay exclude the selected ones
only the selected ones and this is how I
was able to get Twitter working and
there's a bunch of settings in there for
that as well it's really well-documented
not only pebbles own software but also
the third-party stuff that's available
so kudos to them for making that happen
so let's get into my actual experience
with the SmartWatch first of all charge
is supposed to last anywhere from five
to seven days by torture testing it and
using it a ton I was able to wear it
down in two days which is still better
than the day that Samsung estimates for
something like the Galaxy gear the
Galaxy gear doesn't even have its
display on most of the time because it's
no LED display and that is a huge
advantage of pebbles implementation of
an e-ink display because that means even
if you don't go through the complicated
gesture of going exactly like this to
check the time you'll be able to check
the time from any angle and from any
place as long as you can see physically
your wrist next up is the backlight the
way that that's implemented is actually
really smart you can either press the
backlight button here the ergonomics of
which are terrible because there's a
bunch of buttons over here so it's hard
to brace yourself or you can just give a
little flick of your wrist and the
backlight is illuminated allowing you to
easily see the display in the dark it
only stays on for about a second though
now let's talk about the time savings
because you know what it's not that much
on an individual by individual basis so
I just sent myself a text message and
let's wait for that to come through and
basically what it does is it doesn't so
much um you know save me ten minutes
every time I get a text but it allows me
to read this message in Co okay well
Brandon's just like sending me random
text messages I can scroll through it
and then I can just decide no I'm not
going to deal with that now I can deal
with it in a batch later I find it makes
me get disrupted and distracted less
more than anything else so I'm not
constantly bringing out my phone to
check things which can burn time I can
bring it out once in a while do
everything and then put it away it's
also great for when you don't have
access to your phone like when you're at
work for example you could leave it in
your pants pocket if you change into a
lab coat or something and then you could
know if there's something urgent that
you have to go deal with without
carrying your phone around if your work
has a policy against it or when you're
playing sports or whatever else so I was
on a badminton court my parents called
to say that they didn't have the car
we had to come get the baby before he
went to bed I would not have gotten that
message in time if I hadn't been wearing
the pebble so I do find it enhances my
life it does make it better is it a
hundred and fifty dollars worth
I guess it's entirely up to you the
functionality and it isn't perfect like
it doesn't have as much functionality as
the gear for example once these
notifications go away they're they're
gone they're just gone longer messages
you can't scroll through them all
you can't scroll through them all the
way like emails will get will get cut
off whereas text messages and tweets are
generally speaking okay you obviously
can't reply in any way whereas galaxy
gear you can use s voice to do a reply
if you really want to but of course
galaxy gear costs more than twice as
much at least here in Canada so in
conclusion guys I am a wif Kane from
tech syndicate who is the one who
convinced me to pick up a pebble is it
worth 150 dollars for me I would say so
yes it enhances my life it makes it
better in a way that quite frankly a
phone upgrade probably wouldn't even do
because we're actually adding
functionality instead of just making it
a little bit faster or a little bit
higher resolution or whatever the case
may be is the pebble the best
implementation ever up until now
probably not in the future definitely
not there will be better stuff but for
now I really like it you're probably
going to see this living on my wrist for
