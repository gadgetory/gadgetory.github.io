this year we would not be here without
them and also thank you to linda.com
alright guys welcome to the sous booth
again for a 34 inch curved g-sync
monitor this 34 inch monitor rocking IPS
technology 34 40 by 1440 pixels tilt
swivel height adjustment no pivot
because that would be ridiculous because
he'd smack it into the table all the
time and nobody really wants a
vertically curved monitor anyways so
just don't worry about that it's very
interesting it's beautiful aluminum
construction all around it looks great
tiny little bezels the actual physical
bezel of the outside of the monitor is
very thin although you do have a border
on each at the top and left and right
sides and the the stand looks really
cool at first it's just like oh that's
an interesting new design nothing
majorly different but there is a light
on the bottom which projects an ro GI
logo onto your desk which is I don't
know I think that's pretty badass but I
think that's up to you to decide what
you think about that and there's an ROG
logo on the very back of the monitor the
controls for the monitor are on the far
right hand side just on the back and
there's a little joystick control along
with a whole bunch of buttons because
there are tons of features on the
monitor like little fun stuff like turbo
hotkey game plus and game visual
functions and that includes things like
the the crosshair that they can put on
the screen for you or any other kind of
auto adjustment things or changing you
the refresh rate of the monitor really
really quickly on the fly in terms of
latency we're talking about 5
milliseconds which is not super
surprising judging by everything else
that's in this monitor that's about what
I expected and that's kind of itch we'll
probably need a more hands-on review of
this and I'm sure once Linus sees this
he'll want to get his hands on it so I
wouldn't be super surprised at all if we
had a full in-depth review all I can say
right now is it looks absolutely
beautiful but objective reviews of a
monitor at a show is not great
considering all the crazy lights and
everything that's going on so stay tuned
to the Linus exits for more on this
monitor
now I've curved and gsync are not really
your thing and you're more into flat and
freesync you've got the mg 2 7 8 Q
and the mg279q the 278 q is a TN panel
at one millisecond response time and the
two seven nine Q is an IPS panel at four
milliseconds response time I'm not going
to go too in depth on these because
Linus has a video on them from CES but I
also want to give them a shout-out
because they're coming out extremely
soon I think in the next kind of month
or two so stay tuned for that all right
