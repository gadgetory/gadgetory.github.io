brought to you by HyperX fury series
high performance SSDs the Corsair
Vengeance k70 and k9t RGB mechanical
keyboards and NCIX comm are trusted
retailer for high performance gaming
PC's every once in a while I get a
question from one of you guys ask me
where you can get a wireless mechanical
keyboard and I can never usually
properly answer because most places that
I know of are always out of stock that
brings in the raw cats Silva I hope I'm
saying that correctly sorry if I'm not
but this wireless mechanical keyboard
and many other things are the much wire
'less modular gaming board as they call
it as a cherry mechanical keyboard on it
in various possible colors we're not
entirely sure yet this is their day one
of release and there's tons of things
that are up in the air this one
particularly has Cherry MX blacks but
again we're not sure what it's going to
have on it when it's released on the
left side here you can see there's two
full-size USB a ports and one microbead
these are for micro beats for charging
the wireless modular board and the to a
size ports are for one having a mouse on
this board which you can have any Mouse
you want that'll come in later though
and possibly charging another device
this board has a very interesting
feature where you can see I can slide
the mouse pad back and forth but then
the rail goes even further and goes
above where the keyboard is right here
I'd be wondering why well hopefully
later on not entirely sure you'll be
able to attach your own things here like
maybe a mount for your phone or tablet
because this device can be used on
Android phones and windows mobile OS
which is actually fairly interesting but
also he was talking to me you can 3d
print whatever the heck you want and put
a rail on here if he wants you could 3d
print a cup holder and have a cup holder
on your keyboard because why not
3d printing that's basically all I had
to say about that and then if you see
along the top rail here there's also
actually cable management for your mouse
and all that really comes in for the
most because you can just plug it into
USB it's not a proprietary most can have
whatever you want the only thing that
that will really affect is the battery
life this Wireless spice will have a
battery life of around 8 to 12 hours
depending on how you have it set up if
you have all the LEDs on the keyboard
and a crazy Mouse with a ton of
different functions on it and LEDs all
over the place maybe on the lower end of
the 8 to the 12 hours if you have all
the LEDs off on the keyboard a very low
power
maybe on the higher end of the age of 12
hours now I told you guys this can be
used on a Android device or a Windows
Mobile LS it can also be used on micro
consoles or say the Alienware alpha or a
steam machine os box and any of that
kind of stuff you want if you're putting
into a PC you know going through a USB
dongle mobile devices will figure it out
their own way the USB dongle that they
have here is fantastic because it's in
the shape of a couch for whatever reason
they don't know if they're going to
stick with that again this is day one of
product announcement so all this stuff
is up in the air they're probably going
to end up not having your USB dongle as
a couch but who knows they're saying
their wireless connectivity standard is
a patent-pending as far as I can tell
super secrets they won't tell me much
about it thousand Hertz polling rate
5-meter standards you can be 5 meters
away from the the dongle or device it
has a thousand Hertz polling rate that's
really all they're telling me about it
now one of the things I was really
worried about when I first saw this
device was there's a fixed wrist rest
and fixed mousepad and that would be a
big problem because you're investing
what I'm assuming we don't have a price
point yet would be a lot of money
because it's a keyboard and it's all
this other kind of stuff but rest
assured both the wrist rest and mousepad
will be interchangeable swappable
modular completely you can do whatever
the heck you want you can change it to a
soft service a hard surface completely
different thing whatever you want to do
very excited about that because that
will massively increase the lifespan of
this product and last but definitely not
least is the cushions on the bottom we
gamers like our comfort we like our nice
desktop chairs and we like being lazy so
cushions on the bottom are fantastic
these are actually really nice I hope
these end up in the final version of
this product because I do like them a
lot I hope you guys liked watching this
