that's very cool and very exciting this
is the Acer Iconia Tab w 500 this is a
tablet PC it is using Windows 7 ok so
let's just go over what it says on the
box and then we'll get more into the fit
and finish of the overall product once
we get inside you can see it has a 10.1
inch multi-touch led-backlit LCD
supports HDMI it has Wi-Fi which it
bloody well better that's gonna pretend
to be a tablet ok
we've also got evidently a keyboard so
let's go ahead and get this all let's
have a look at the specs so here we are
we have Windows 7 home premium 32-bit
AMD dual core processor C 50 BAM
that's the surprise because that is not
only see you see how they have that
listed as a processor not as a CPU well
the reason is that this is an APU this
is an AMD fusion tablet so it uses the C
50 APU which means it has a CPU and a
GPU built in to one die pretty sweet
10.1 inch multi-touch HD LED LCD 2 gigs
of memory 32 gig SSD - and one card
reader Wireless an 1.3 megapixel webcam
and a 3 cell lithium ion battery now
think about that 3 cell lithium ion
battery you might go all 3 cell probably
does enough great battery life well with
AMD fusion we're talking about a whole
different ball of wax because fusion
uses very very little power due to the
efficiency of the design ok so here's a
little install guide for using the plug
apparently you can rotate the plug
should you so desire excellent here's an
international travelers warranty as well
as a QuickStart guide next we have a
setup and configuration guide which
probably shows you a couple useful
tricks and tips alright and let's go
ahead and take this off find the tablet
itself so if you have any more
accessories first oh yeah okay so
there's our keyboard okay over here so
there's our there's our power adapter so
this is what they mean by being able to
rotate it I suppose
so you can put it this way or no I don't
think it goes in that way oh yeah okay
it looks like you gotta lock it in there
we go there alright so why don't we pull
out the tablet portion first okay I was
actually already playing around with
this so I apologize in advance for the
fact that it's got a couple fingerprints
on it but you guys can deal all right so
go ahead press the button here okay
please wait we're gonna get into Windows
10 home premium the default user is
logged in there we go all that camera
man have a look at that while I dig out
the keyboard so that I can show that to
you guys cuz that is a very cool little
feature so let's get all this stuff out
of our way so we can make room just for
the product itself okay and here we go
so let's do a quick tour of the device
so here is a Windows button alright
that's pretty much it for buttons on the
front of the device so everything is
multi-touch ready it is accelerated by a
DirectX 11 GPU so that means that not
only do you have support for your
multi-touch but you're going to have
full video acceleration for anything
that is a direct compute OpenCL that's
what you get with DirectX 11 as well as
Windows Aero glass so let's move around
to the side here we've got our HDMI
output as well as an SD card reader okay
we've got our volume up and down power
we've got a headphone jack there's a low
battery LED indicator down here we've
got a ventilation port we've also got
our webcam right there moving this way
we've got yet another webcam okay on the
other side we have power in and then
finally on the bottom we're gonna find
USB as well as a couple of pegs for
mounting this to the included keyboard
this appears to be some kind of law I
guess there's an orientation lock yeah
so it does have an accelerometer which
means that you can hold it this way
there we go over this way just like that
it'll resize your desktop and now let's
have a look at the keyboard itself so
what you do is you evidently lift this
up and plug it in so USB is gonna power
and give us an interface to this little
included keyboard we've got one of those
old-school style rubber thing in the
middle of the key I actually really like
this I used to I used to use this on a
really old laptop that I had if you've
got two hands to use it this is one of
the best mousing interfaces I believe
that has ever graced notebooks
everywhere so I'm personally a big fan
of that the keyboard is a on this
particular demo unit a Singh unilingual
or mono lingual whatever you prefer to
call it is only one language so you've
got full-size shift keys full-sized
Enter key you've got a full-size
backspace key now the keyboard is quite
small but remember this is only a 10.1
inch screen so that's pretty much what
we have to deal with now the most
exciting thing about this tablet slash
sub notebook by a longshot
is and diffusion so give me a second I'm
gonna get connected to our Wi-Fi and I'm
going to show you guys some of the
advantages of AMD fusion so here's our
fusion tablet running my personal
favorite YouTube HD video so we've got
Big Buck Bunny running I'm actually
gonna find a more action-packed part to
skip to for you guys oh yeah this'll do
okay so you can see the playback is
quite smooth now remember the DirectX 11
component well I can't really call it a
GPU it's very challenging so the DirectX
11 graphics processor in the APU which
is part of the APU is capable not only
of accelerating flash it's also good for
html5 and it's going to give you the
capability of using Direct compute and
OpenCL applications as well which is
something that a non DirectX 11
compliant
part will not allow you to do now the
c50 inside this particular tablet I'm
just going to go ahead and close down ie
here all right let's go to task manager
so it is a dual-core processor you can
see the CPU usage is quite high even so
we do have video running in the
background and so it's splitting the
load between the CPU and the GPU
components of the APU I'm going to go
ahead and turn that off but it is a dual
core so you can see that in the task
manager and it's a nine watt part so I
want to show you guys the total system
power consumption let me turn my video
back on in full-screen mode here and I
can go ahead and do that there we go and
here we are
so total system power consumption
remember this is a rough ballpark figure
is about 36 watts for the entire tablet
so what that means is better battery
life better performance and more overall
capabilities for a fusion tablet like
