unboxing of the Logitech G 35 I had a
lot of people requesting this I couldn't
get my hands on one I finally have one
this is a 7.1 surround sound gaming
headset a Logitech Figures victory never
sounded this good that means that you
actually have full 7.1 surround that is
multiple speakers per ear cup giving you
none of this sort of phony 3d positional
algorithm stuff with two speakers
although there's something to be said
for that approach as well but Logitech
has gone ahead and implemented multiple
speakers to give you that true
positional sound now I'm gonna preface
this with telling you guys that this
approach is not ideal for music I'll
tell you that right now these are not
going to be the best music headphones in
the world they're not meant to be
they're part of Logitech's G series I
mean have you seen a Logitech G Series
keyboard that's ideal for music huh so
this is a gaming product first and
foremost ahead of any other priorities
and that is what the features are
designed for so once I can finally
figure out how to stop stalling and get
this box open we'll be able to proceed
with the unboxing which I have finally
managed to do so we'll go over the back
of the box first and have a look at what
Logitech has to say for themselves on
this here product 7.1 surround sound
powered by dual B technology delivers a
detailed sound field excellent three
swappable headband pads let you choose
the one that best fits your head will
show you those in a minute
three customizable G keys for OneTouch
command over music voice morphing and
more so pretty much whatever you want on
ear audio controls for quick access to
volume mic mute and surround sound
adjustments adjustable noise cancelling
microphone reduces background noise
awesome noise cancelling microphone is a
definite plus full speed all digital USB
connection delivers clean clear audio so
it is entirely non dependent on your
sound part this is a USB headset
oh this is just this is just a filler no
no this has something inside I'm gonna
find out what's inside here for you guys
so that you don't have to buy one just
to find out what's inside this box all
right so these are the top pieces so you
can see they attach my velcro this is
the B cup and this is the C cup
so that'll come up on your head there
all right
next we'll go ahead and open up the
plastic clamshell here I'll have a look
at the g35 itself now that we've seen
the accessories I'm just gonna go ahead
and see if I can uh you must resort to
the unboxing knife okay so these are
looking pretty nice so far let me just
hold on let me see if there's anything
worthwhile in here there's probably a CD
that I'm gonna tell you to throw away
yeah this one and then there's a
QuickStart guide as well as they tell us
what you think inquiry from the Logitech
okay so let's start with the overall
look at this guy very industrial look
you can see they got you know little
dots and lines now it looks a little bit
kind of dusty out of the box but I think
that's just a byproduct of the finish on
here it's a very satiny velvety type
finish so it's not glossy that means
it's gonna be very very durable it's
actually made of like a rubber material
you can see that it's quite flexible so
if you were to say for example through
your headphones down and anger and they
landed on the rubber here then they
should be quite safe indeed alright the
hinges as you can see are made of only
me are they made of metal
no okay no no the adjustable my head but
head piece aren't your pieces use this
metal slider and you can actually this
is kind of nice because if you remember
what size you are like okay I have it on
five and it's the most comfortable then
you can just leave it on five at all
times and then if they someone comes and
you know comes into your room and uses
your headset then you can easily adjust
it back to where you need it to be so
that's pretty cool
the hinges right here have a little bit
of sway in them so depending on the
shape of your head you're gonna be able
to have those fit on there nicely and
you can see there's a bit of give to
them this way so that's going to
account for different head shapes
different ear positioning on the side of
your head you can see here the ear cups
have like a nice plethora material on
them that's quite thick so I'm gonna
take my hat off in a moment and try
these on
for reals and see how comfortable they
are you can actually I don't know if I
can get you guys a good angle but from
where I can from where I'm standing I
can see the multiple speakers in there
as well and that's that's pretty cool
too I don't know if you guys are gonna
be able to see that though it's pretty
hard oh well no big deal on the side
we've got a Logitech logo on this side
on the other side we're gonna find some
more stuff so we've got our G one two
three keys and those are quite easily
accessible on the side of your head and
then we also have a volume control wheel
as well as a microphone mute button and
then we've got a just a gorgeous braided
cord I don't think I've seen one this
thick or with this high quality of ass
leaving on it in quite a while actually
that's really nice inaudible plated USB
connector although it's pretty debatable
whether that even matters although oh
look at this no no the inside is
gold-plated which is what actually could
potentially matter if it did matter so
the one that's installed by default you
can see the little velcro thing here is
the a cup so I guess that's for one size
of head actually ironically I think
that's the largest one so here we go
let's throw this on I'll show you guys
the microphone on the side so we're
finding out what size my head is right
now this is quite comfortable very
cushioning both on the ears as well as
on the headband now that's unusual out
of the box for a high-end headset
because a lot of them are going to be
sort of over tight to ensure that
they're not going to squeeze the head of
a new user although you know if I was
using these for several hours at a time
I'd probably want to break in period to
make sure they're gonna sit on there and
real nice so we've got our lower wall
mic here
I'm going to show you guys that sliding
action GGI gym with
sliding karate chop action on the arm
anyway there's the microphone and then
the G keys are very easily accessible
you can see that here I can also easily
adjust my volume mute the microphone do
whatever it is I need to do this one I'm
like great shot guys such a jerk I hate
encouraging that guy yeah a great go
team so that's very very convenient as
well I think that's pretty much
everything I wanted to say about the g35
they do block quite a lot of sound I
couldn't hear myself very well why I
have them over my ears so while I'm not
a hundred percent sure whether they're a
closed or an open style headset my guess
would be they're fairly closed just
because I don't see any holes here I
don't see any gaps here and they are
using a fairly noise-isolating material
on the ear cuts themselves for so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
Logitech G 35 surround sound gaming
headset and don't forget to subscribe to
