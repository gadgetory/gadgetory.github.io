the tablet the entire Internet's are
excited about this is the Nexus 7 from
Google and Asus it's a joint project you
can see the branding is sort of clever
there's a picture of a tablet which also
happens to be sort of in the shape of a
seven which corresponds to the diagonal
size of the screen it is a 7 inch tablet
includes a Tegra 3 processor running at
one point 3 gigahertz remember that's
for high power cores plus one low power
core for that particular processor and a
powerful GPU it comes in 8 gig or 16 gig
models and there's a few things here
that we should probably talk about
really quick so it's completely ready
for jellybean which is Android 4.1 which
includes a lot of UI tweaks as well as a
few other cool things so Nexus 7 runs
the latest version Mandarin comes with
all the Google Apps you left
check Gmail browse and the web with
Chrome so the browser that we found on
previous editions of Android is going to
be gone and with it flash support so
we're gonna be using Chrome on our
tablets from now on watch videos from
YouTube chat face to face so it has a
front-facing camera only no rear facing
camera it is a 1.2 megapixel camera and
honestly at the price points that these
tablets are coming in at some sacrifices
did have to be made so it's $1.99 for an
8 gig and about 249 remember these are
USD prices so your mileage may vary to
49 for a 16-game there are no higher
capacity versions available at this time
and that is the only difference between
the two capacities is just the capacity
so Google Play is there well what
they've updated the market branding to
so there's a lot of different stuff in
there now including songs books movies
and as well as apps and games full
fledge on android have a powerful quad
core processor from some different
civilizations but so that's an IPS that
is an IPS display which means you're
going to get a very decent viewing angle
and what's cool about it is the fact
that it is full HD so it is 1280 by 800
which means you can watch 720p video in
full screen and it will be full
resolution on this particular tablet and
the other really cool thing about that
is because of the fact that it is in a 7
inch form factor it has extremely high
pixel density which you know if you have
used a Retina display from Apple you're
gonna be familiar with already is
much less fatiguing on the eyes and
makes text look just infinitely better
I've actually I've taken it out already
prior to the unboxing and I played
around with it a little bit and I'm very
very impressed love the screen love the
responsiveness love the accuracy so it's
got a 10-point multi-touch which is
about as much as any sort of normal
person would need not that I'm saying
that if you have six fingers on each
hand that's a problem it's just that you
know you might want to use only ten of
them at a given time when you're you
know what moving right along
let's have a look at the physicality of
the unit so there's a USB port here and
what's cool about this is it supports
USB on-the-go which means that it can
not only act as a in device mode but
also in a host mode so if you were to
plug a keyboard for example into it then
it can it can you can use that okay it
will act as the the tablet will act as a
host instead of the other way around so
you can actually pair it with the
keyboard and use a keyboard on the
device which is very very cool there's
your headphone jack which is pretty
standard moving right along
not a whole lot not a whole lot there's
a light sensor on it somewhere out there
it is as well as the front-facing camera
there's your power there's your volume
rocker the back is very nice I'm
actually not a big fan of metal backs on
tablets because it they tend to get
grimy looking they tend to get stained
very easily they're heavier they're just
they're cold or they're too hot they're
just not that comfortable so this is a
rubberized backing which has a bit of a
grippy texture to it that's very very
nice now I loved the blackberry playbook
for a couple of reasons it was super
snappy great as a little web browsing
device and I thought the form factor was
just perfect so as you guys can probably
imagine the Nexus 7 definitely floats my
boat in much the same way I just want to
have a quick look at what's included so
you got your warranty card as well as a
Quick Start Guide charging books
charging cable as well as a charger so
not a huge accessory package by any
stretch of the imagination
so let's get logged in here and let's
have a look at some of the differences
this is one of my favorite tablet
benchmarks for a couple of reasons
because it just seems to absolutely
destroy every tablet
another mobile device that I have ever
had the pleasure of encountering so here
I've got my other two favorite tablets
the iPad 2 I don't have an iPad 3
unfortunately I wish I could talk about
that one a little bit and then I've also
got a Galaxy Tab 10.1 so this is running
the older honeycomb version of Android
so give me two seconds and I'm gonna get
this page loaded up so the screen
doesn't have quite the vibrance that
sorry this one actually has flash on it
so the videos even trying to play it
doesn't have quite the vibrance of the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 and not quite the
brightness of the iPad 2 but it's very
very passable and it's a smaller screen
anyway so actually that doesn't really
make a difference at all okay this is
something that just absolutely tanks the
performance of every mobile browser that
I've had the displeasure of using trying
to view YouTube comments which as you
guys can imagine is something that I do
try to do on a tablet so I want you guys
to just have a quick look at what the
fluidity is like so yes the UI on the
Nexus 7 is absolutely gorgeous and
amazing and so smooth and it looks like
it decided to do this a slightly
different way from me here give me a sec
guys so this is cool they have with the
Chrome and YouTube app integration that
they've done here this is this is
absolutely awesome so instead of
clicking on this and having it open in
Chrome it actually opens in the YouTube
app which is so much smoother compared
to trying to navigate in Chrome for
things like reading comments and seeing
related videos and seeing the
information all you do is rotate it and
it goes ahead and puts it in and I'm
just gonna turn that down a little bit
there we go goes ahead and puts it in
video viewing mode for you rotations
pretty smooth however for the sake of
showing you guys what I think of the
performance here this is cool too when
you're clicking on something small it's
really neat it pops it up for you so you
can make sure you click the right thing
so we're going to go ahead and view the
comments of that video in much the same
way that we're looking at them on the
other tablets so I'll show you guys how
this tanks the performance of pretty
much every tablet
ever and I quite can't quite figure out
why but the Nexus 7 does better then so
the iPad in spite of its normal
smoothness you can see legs quite a bit
behind when I'm trying to browse
comments and just has sort of glitches
and the loading same thing with older
Android tablets you can see it's very
very glitchy trying to browse this for
whatever reason it doesn't help when
there are tons of comments on the video
and this particular one has a few
thousand comments so you can see it's
actually not as bad as I've come to
expect from Android tablets it's closer
to the experience you have with the iPad
2 but with some of the UI tweaks that
they've made I would never have to use
this kind of an interface for it anyway
which is very very refreshing quebra
games run obviously better on the Nexus
7 you can see the older Tegra 2 is
chopping up a little bit just watching
this spaceship hover around and
demolition Inc whereas here I'm just
going to brace myself so you can see
this movement compared to the Galaxy Tab
10.1 well you'll have to take my word
for it because apparently you can't see
that at all and the lighting in here is
absolutely terrible but whatever okay so
we're gonna do that play play the
graphics also look better just due to
the higher pixel density so you can see
lots of aliasing and garbage on this one
whereas here the line looks a lot
smoother it's not because it's running a
high res it's just the higher pixel
density that's all yeah it looks so much
sharper and runs way smoother you can
see it start to chug as it tries to zoom
in on the city here that is absolutely
absolutely outstanding I mean none of
this should really come as a surprise
given that it is a Tegra 3 processor and
that is better than a Tegra 2 but just
the fluidity is is very very nice
there's a few other tweaks that I really
really liked already about about the
Nexus 7 so one of them is the quick
access to settings as well as the quick
access here to your rotation lock little
things like that that make me really
happy touch screen is very very accurate
and move
within the I mean it's just so lightning
fast and smooth that it just makes
everything else look like a joke not
we've seen in the past let's just go
back let's go back to home
oh let's load up the Nvidia globe all
demo because who doesn't love the global
demo I haven't actually seen it in
person before because this is the first
time I'd had access to a to a Tegra 3
tablet cool I don't know how to use it
or anything
oh you tilt it okay I guess that makes
sense we glow okay this is sort of less
fun than I thought it was gonna be boom
you know things over with physics okay
sorry I'm done now so I think that
pretty much wraps it up I don't know how
much else there is for me to say about
it other than so far I'm really
impressed
it basically is everything that it
sounds like it is it's a Tegra 3 tablet
at a $1.99 price point for the 8 gig
version you don't get any SD expansion
so that's maybe one thing that some
people don't like about oh yeah there's
a speaker on the back right under the
Asus logo that bar right there so yeah
it's a it's a it's a knight it's a $1.99
Tegra 3 tablet that has a very nice
screen good form factor great build
quality and I'm overall very impressed
and it's my camera really not focusing
like this entire time oh it's just the
contrast ok well the screen looks a lot
better than it does in my pathetic
camera so I'm sorry for that but thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the Nexus 7 don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and don't forget to subscribe to
my MCI XCOM channel as well or to the
NCIX kalam channel as well where i'll be
doing a full proper rundown of this new
tablet and the new OS that goes with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
