office reading through a white paper
from Nvidia in order to make a video for
you guys that would simplify and answer
all the crazy questions people had all
about the new multi GPU and sli
configurations for the 1000 series and
DirectX 12 era armed with the white
paper I thought this would be an easy
task but within an hour - I was
collapsed onto my desk contemplating the
sheer futility of life since then I have
received answers to my multiple
horrendously long emails to Nvidia ones
that hopefully will allow me to shed
some light on what the hell is going on
kula masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
which allows you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours of the link in the
video description down below first
things first the question that has been
hotly debated since the keynote where
they announced the GTX 1080 and 1070 is
3 and 4 Way SLI still a thing
no not for gaming only specifically
overclocking and benchmarking
applications like fire strike catzilla
etc that's it I'm not even upset I like
this move 3 &amp;amp; 4 Way SLI are and have
been always such an unjustifiable
configuration that telling people very
directly not to do it and going even
further by not supporting it contributes
nothing to in videos bottom line and
saves people from lighting their money
on fire good guy Nvidia but all of that
said and this adds a lot of confusion to
the topic you can still play games with
three or four graphics cards and you can
use the performance of all of them
together just not in classic SLI mode
this can be done with MDA mode also
known as multi display adapter mode or
through LD a explicit also known as link
display adapter explicit mode two
different methods of GPU cooperation
that are at least somewhat separate from
LD a implicit mode which is what in
video we'll be using for SLI it's okay
I'll get more into those specifics later
it's not that bad but here we go
basically game designers can explicitly
code any degree of multi GPU support for
their games including 3 &amp;amp; 4 way Nvidia
solutions but please note that because
this responsibility lies with the
developers don't expect it to happen
much back to the modes which one is best
out of the three great question and I
can confidently tell you that we don't
know yet I don't have enough stuff to
test and in asking Nvidia their official
response was that they don't have enough
data yet and they need more dx12
multi-gpu enabled games notice that part
developers probably not doing it much in
order to make any sort of qualitative
determination which also means that no
there will be no benchmarks in this
video that will come later but I do have
many more interesting things to say so I
would I would I would stay so here's
what we do know Nvidia's new high
bandwidth sli bridge is not required you
do need it for 5k gaming and surround
gaming but if you have one of those
fancy led bridges you're fine for 4k
gaming in 2560 by 1440 pea gaming at 120
Hertz you have a standard bridge you
take another step down and do 2560 by
1440 P at 60 Hertz and nineteen to
twenty by ten eighty gaming yeah Nvidia
will automatically notify you that your
bridge is not good enough if you try to
push it to a setup that is outside of
those specifications so I wouldn't worry
about it much plug everything in see if
it works if it does you're good if it
doesn't they'll tell you and you can fix
it pretty easily but Luke you lie they
were saying things about enthusiast key
that would allow us to unlock three and
four way stuff that software unlock does
not exist
Nvidia killed it that was fast and given
how clear I've made my position on the
merits of greater than two-way SLI it
should come as no surprise that I think
it's a good thing but I also didn't buy
three or four graphics cards already
based on a promise that Nvidia made that
they would all work together with this
thing called enthusiast key I feel like
that while a number of customers were
impacted by this is probably fairly low
these individuals would represent the
most die-hard of the diehard Nvidia fans
and gaming enthusiasts and they should
probably have it made up to them in some
way just saying all right but hold up
let's take a few steps back how exactly
does this MDA and Lda mode thing work
well when SLI is disabled in the Nvidia
control panel your cards will be running
in MDA mode MDA is Microsoft allowing
any set of GPUs to be used including
Kross brand so theoretically you can use
an AMD card and an nvidia card and have
them be all over the place in terms of
tears and stuff and it
should work you can do this all at the
same time directx12 new feature named
shared fences allows for the
synchronized commands to the various
GPUs and said GPUs will be able to share
a pool of memory which resides in system
memories all that kind of stuff is cool
when SLI is enabled however your setup
will be in Lda mode another Microsoft
technology the sub mode Lda implicit
allows you to use the sli bridge to
transfer display data between GPUs
without interference caused from other
agents activity on PCIe and should
through this clearer communication
method allow for additional capabilities
by utilizing the bridge but we'll have
to wait and see to what the impact is of
that while in lda mode if the games are
coded to support explicit multi-gpu they
will be able to scale however well with
the amount of cards you have in the
system without using the sli bridge
again we'll have to wait to see how well
this works but this would theoretically
allow you more than two cards and that's
basically all we have to work with at
the moment we will have to wait and see
how MDA and LD a explicit modes handle
regular two-way operation compared to
traditional SLI and what the three and
four way situation ends up looking like
so here's the final word if you want to
play games with your setup and aren't
interested in just re running the same
freaking benchmarking programs on the
same freakin setup all day you should
probably stick with a maximum of two
cards and which mode works best will be
heavily dependent on the game or
application you're using oh and I guess
you could run to an SLI and a third for
physics if you just really hate your
money you you can do that tunnel bear is

watching guys if you liked this video
and like spending your money at least
somewhat intelligently hit that like
button if you dislike this video and
you're like the Joker in that one Batman
movie when he lights the entire pile of
money on fire that was actually pretty
sick if you're more like that you can
dislike the video if you just thought
that scene was cool and hit the dislike
button I won't hold it against you
that's fine
if you want to jump on the forum to
discuss everything I said on here and
argue about things please argue like in
a friendly way disgust if you want to
discuss things become a member on the
forum cool if you want to see
overclocking on GTA X 1080 because it's
like weird and there's like pull up per
voltage point offset stuff click here
cuz that's another video that's like a
little advanced and interesting and
video changes to a bunch of stuff and
I'm going to go over now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
