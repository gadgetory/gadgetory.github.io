surround which is pretty cool now you
can see over in the right hand corner of
the right hand corner screen that this
game does not fully support 3d vision I
actually can't even hear myself talk
here right now so uh anyway this game
doesn't actually properly support 3d
vision but what it does work really well
with is invidious around so you can see
that when I'm flying around I'm actually
going to turn
I think this turns 3d vision off okay
maybe this turns 3d vision off that just
turns the glasses off okay hold on
there's some way to turn 3d vision off
I'm fairly certain with it maybe assist
button yeah there we go so if I turn 3d
vision off now you can actually see you
enjoy what I'm doing as well here so I'm
just going to turn around get back down
to the ground find the refinery but the
the surround gaming experience is
definitely very cool in games that
support the the proper Wow words fail me
right now in games that support the
proper field of view there that's what I
was looking for so I'm going to just
kind of fly around a little bit
check this out this is running on two
GTX 480 s so I did a video recently
showing the entire rig that I'm running
this on and I'm not actually trying to
accomplish the mission here or anything
just kind of trying to show you the way
you can see all of the scenery on either
side it makes for a very very
interesting gaming experience cuz flying
past something you'll actually see it
show up on the side of you when you fly
past it it's very cool and it also is a
big advantage when you're flying in
towards enemies or whatever like if
you're trying to see you know suppose
I'm zooming in on this I'm going in on
this tank right and I can see oh there's
one over there so I can quickly navigate
over and fire missiles at that guy too
hopefully before he destroys the stuff
on
protecting so anyway this is Nvidia
surround as well as 3d visions so the
whole experience is pretty cool this
game doesn't support 3d vision all that
well what I'll do is I'll find some
other games that do support 3d vision
really well and make a couple other
videos with those too so thank you
checking out my video blog don't forget
to subscribe and yeah this is a pretty
cool experience in 3 x HD resolution can
you see it pretty good from there with
the camera
pretty good shrug ok cool that's good
thank you for watching
so the cameraman suggested that this
might be a better angle sitting directly
behind the screens to properly enjoy the
ingenious around gaming experience I'm
gonna fly in between these buildings if
I can yeah there you go so you can
really enjoy the landscapes and really
it gives you that that peripheral vision
you don't really focus too much on the
on the screens to the right and to the
left but it just gives you that much
more perspective on your surroundings
like I can be flying sort of in the
middle of nowhere but I can really see
like where the target I'm protecting is
and if I accidentally fly into the
ground I guess I can I can watch the
ground more carefully make sure that
doesn't happen maybe we'll do it on
purpose here let's see what happens if I
fly into the refinery there you go
so when you're looking at it from
overhead that's actually pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
