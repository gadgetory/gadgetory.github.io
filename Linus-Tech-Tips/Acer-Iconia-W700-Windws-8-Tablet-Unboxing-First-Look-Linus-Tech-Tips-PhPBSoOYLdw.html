to my unboxing and first look at the
Acer Iconia W 700 tablet now unlike most
of the tablets we've seen in the last
few years actually this is not an ARM
based design or an iPad or anything that
requires a special operating system to
run this is an Intel based so that is an
x86 based tablet that comes in at a
pretty high price point although when
you compare it to something like you
know a 64 gig iPad honestly it's not
that unreasonable it's a little under a
thousand bucks but has the ability to
run a full-blown Windows 8 operating
system with all of the fixings and it
looks like this is an eval unit so these
sound the seals are already broken but
why don't we do a quick run through the
specs before we get started so Windows 8
64-bit intel core i5 3317 use so it's a
1.6 gig or 1.7 gigahertz rather CPU that
turbo is up to 2.6 gigahertz
it's an 11.6 inch multi-touch full HD
display it comes with 4 gigs of memory
128 gig SSD which i think is pretty cool
it also has a factor that that that's in
my notes somewhere whatever I can't find
it
something milliamp hour battery that's
basically good for six hours of fairly
heavy use or as much as nine hours of
fairly light use it's sort of not
counting any standby time so there's a
variety of different configurations it's
available with different amounts of our
different sizes of drive and it's
available with different accessories and
all that kind of stuff but the config
that we have comes with a keyboard dock
so this is what makes it so Acer feels
they are bridging the gap between tablet
and notebook because the power is
somewhere in between a tablet and a
notebook with a core i7 but not a
particular or rather a core i5 but not a
particularly fast one and the form
factor is somewhere between a tablet and
notebook much like a Microsoft Surface
pro just because it is a little bit on
the thicker side so it comes with a faux
leather carrying case that there we go
yeah go away take that off that has okay
a place to put the tablet inside it here
that's got kind of a plastic backing to
protect it
has this is actually quite nice has a
keyboard a full keyboard that you can
then prop the tablet up in so just like
that so let's go ahead and pull the
tablet out and see how she looks so it's
a little bit on the thicker side
compared to again you know your iPad or
your your Asus Transformer or any kind
of arm-based design but that's because
it has to accommodate the cooling needed
for an intel basically what amounts to
an ultrabook processor so it's hard to
get the form factor much slimmer than
what they've done here so you can see
there's two vents down here on the
bottom as well as an orientation lock oh
okay is that an orientation lock button
or is that the power button guess we'll
find out in a moment here on the side
here we've got oh no that's power
volume rocker as well as a headphone
microphone jack on the bottom you've got
two speakers so stereo speakers on the
bottom the tablet is meant to be used in
portrait or a rather in landscape mode
and then on the other side we find DC
power in USB 3 which is one of them
really nice things about these Windows 8
tablets or really any tablet that has
USB 3 is nice to have USB 3 on and
finally we've got micro HDMI out which
actually allows you to use it as a
notebook computer if you just kind of
plug it into a dock as well as a USB 3
hub so and then you can use micro HDMI
to output to any desktop monitor so in
terms of included accessories we've got
a power adapter which looks a little
something like that go have a look at
that there's an iPhone size comparison
for you then we've got the power cord
that goes with that we've also got a USB
charging cable so a USB charging cable
looks a little something like that it
just uses standard or rather no that's a
data transfer cable
so that's micro USB for data transfer
here is our power cord alright next up
we've got this is handy so they actually
include a micro HDMI to VGA adapter so
if you're gonna use this for
presentations or whatever else on the
road they include that so you have not
only digital output but also analog
output from the tablet itself more
accessories wow there's a lot of stuff
and Here I am really running out of
space pretty quickly so we're gonna
ditch some of these things and yeah we
have more space so it comes with a
cleaning cloth there you go a little
nice little white microfiber cleaning
cloth a bunch of DVDs although I don't
know where they're expecting you to put
those it does not have an optical Bay in
case you guys are wondering
international travelers warranty is a
nice thing to have because if you move
or whatever else there are devices where
your warranty does not come with you
which I've always thought is bizarre and
I'm glad to see that trend really
turning around all right more components
here now if there's any complaints that
I've seen about this particular tablet
it's that compared to the build quality
of the tablet itself the dock is a
little bit a little bit less than less
than equally satisfactory compared to
that I mean I've had people come out as
far as to say the build quality of the
dock is very disappointing compared to
the tablet so this is this is plastic
this piece slides into presumably here
and allows you to dock the tablet like
this so you could actually use the unit
as a secondary monitor here actually I
can lift this up you could use the unit
as a secondary monitor I have no idea
what you're talking about alright so we
figured out the dock stand so yeah it's
a little bit not quite up to the same
standard of build quality as the tablet
itself although this is as much a
compliment for the tablet as it is sort
of a knock against the stand here so it
can be configured in portrait like this
just like that or it can be configured
in landscape mode like this okay well I
didn't get it in that time so there it
should go in like that and then it can
sit in landscape mode like that there
you go that's how it looks like from the
back yeah like it's really not the best
thing in the world ever but the tablet
itself is absolutely gorgeous so we're
just going to show how it fits in here
just just once and so you kind of put in
like that there's little rubber pieces
here soft plastic pieces they keep it
from getting scratched as you plug it in
and this actually gives you a little bit
more in terms of i/o so there's your
vents on the top so you're still going
to get all the cooling you need and it
expands that single USB 3 to 3 USB 3
port so you
actually plug in all the peripherals you
need and all that it also adds a
pass-through for the power in and last
but not least you still have access to
your micro HDMI so you're still going to
be able to use it as like a dual monitor
setup or you could even just tuck it
away in the corner and just use a full
desktop keyboard and mouse and all that
good stuff which is which is a really
nice thing the only thing that I would
have liked to see added would be wired
LAN as like I'd like it with a an
adapter chipset USB 3 2 wired LAN in
here that way you really have more like
a desktop experience
so let's go ahead and pull it out of
that and put it into the travel case
that also comes with this particular
setup so there we go
it's not quite the same level of
elegance as something like Microsoft's
touch keyboard or type keyboard but what
it does do is it does actually protect
the unit in a meaningful way so around
the edges you've got a soft a soft
rubber that comes around all of the
aluminum edges and actually fits quite
snugly which makes sense because it's
designed just for this device this
device only and that was the worst
German accent anyone's ever heard ever
but you know whatever you guys don't
watch this show for my German accent I'm
sure so there you go so you can see what
that looks like it folds down on top so
this is Gorilla Glass 2 so I wouldn't
worry too much about damaging it one way
or the other but it folds down on to
turn the screen back on there six little
rubber pads that are on the keyboard
itself so that it's not just gonna mash
itself up against this is plastic so I
probably wouldn't be likely to scratch
it anyway but it's not going to mash
itself up against the keyboard and leave
those imprints on the screen that you've
seen time and time again with various
notebooks in terms of the thickness once
you get it covered in the faux leather
casing as well as the the plastic
housing you've got a size here that
looks sort of wonder what are we at
we're at about triple the thickness of
something like an iPhone and honestly
compared to something like an s7 which
you guys have probably seen if you've
been watching my live streams because I
usually put it in front of me these days
so when s7 is actually not that much
bigger see like that so it's a 13 point
something inch model 13.3 inch but as
actually quite a bit thinner so an
ultrabook if you don't need that tablet
form factor sometimes may end up being a
better solution for you because they do
usually end up being a little bit more
powerful whereas that one's a little bit
more expensive so I guess it's a wide
variety of trade-offs but anyway that's
what it looks like in more like a
notebook configuration the screen itself
goes up - let me just have a look here
there we go screen brightness yay nice a
nice bright screen so it's very very
vibrant it uses an IPS panel so the
viewing angles are outstanding I mean
this is something that we've kind of
come to expect from tablets now but I'm
really glad that that hold trend of sort
of cheap tablets with cheap panels
turned around can you see the viewing
angle pretty well there or you can I
can't you were waving at yourself oh
okay
okay well I wasn't watching him do that
the keyboard itself has a bilingual
layout because this is a Canadian model
but not all of them will have that so
that's gonna vary depending on the
territory that you're operating within
and I'm just going to switch back to my
word document where I have my notes for
myself so I can see if there's anything
else I need to tell you about this guy
so let's make this more of a summary
than anything else it's got a 720p front
camera a 1080p rear camera Bluetooth
Wi-Fi and all that stuff that you've
come to expect it comes with a dock it
comes with sort of the accessories that
you really really need out of the box
although I think probably the most
exceptional thing about it is much like
the s7 this is a new Acer in terms of
build quality because I mean when I got
my hands on the s7 I'd seen pictures and
I knew that it was supposed to be really
nice but I still wasn't quite expecting
what ended up getting delivered to me so
there's absolutely no flex in it it's
absolutely gorgeous you can see there's
only one gap in the solid aluminum body
here so I'm gonna try and show that to
the camera and that's up in this top
strip right here which I'm assuming is
something to do with antenna reception
because we've seen a few tablets that
have solid metal backings that have
ended up with reception issues on their
wireless wireless interfaces you get a
1080p screen which is really really nice
in a small form-factor like this but one
of the challenges is that when you're
not using the
upsy daisy's when you're not using the
modern UI you may find yourself you may
find yourself in a situation where it's
not really that easy to read text or
that easy to use it unless you blow
things up when you're in more like the
the classic interface one thing that I
should probably mention is if you do a
Fivefinger thing like this you get into
a sirs little launcher here where you
can store some favorite apps including
their cloud document storage backup
manager also shows you like your device
settings and all that cool stuff
remember that's not the only way to
access that stuff you can also swipe in
from the side and I forgot this before
but it was 315 it brightness on the IPS
screen so that's actually pretty
outstanding and I think that pretty much
covers it thank you for checking out
