unboxing of the Asus vg2 7/8 3d monitor
with a couple of cool features that
really set it apart from some of the
previous generation 3d monitors
including a Seuss's own if you guys
remember we gave away one of those
24-inch 3d ready monitors in the Duke
Nukem contest and it's also the 3d ready
monitor that I use on my home test bench
which you guys will see during some of
my late night benchmarking session
videos and whatnot so hopefully this is
a worthy successor and let's go ahead
and get started getting this opened up
so we got a couple bits of assembly
hardware here in the place where you're
bound to notice it so I'm guessing
you'll need that we've also got a VIP
member notice and oK we've got 3d vision
two glasses right here so why do we have
3d vision two glasses well the reason is
that this monitor is actually optimized
for 3d vision - we have a dual link DVI
cable keep opening things shall we we
have an audio cable we have some 3d
vision drivers some 3d vision glasses
QuickStart guides and general
instructions and whatnots we have the
base which I can't get out yet we have
some more cables including a VGA cable
although really guys if you're gonna run
this monitor off a VGA cable just go
home we have a power cable and we have
the 27 inch monitor itself okay so give
me a sec I'm probably actually no wait
don't give me a sec I can do this
alright so I just need the base which I
just have to
force it when in doubt force it that's
like computer tech class 101 if it
doesn't fit push harder
all right there's our base it's not
looks very similar to the base from the
24-inch model I've got that 3d for the
logo looking thing on it if it's similar
to the other one then it probably
rotates yep there you go so it actually
swivels okay I would be robbing you guys
of the unboxing experience if I turned
off the camera to remove all the packing
materials right is that is that how this
works
some days I actually don't know so we're
gonna go ahead flip this bad boy over
then we're gonna go ahead and put this
right over here okay and then we're
gonna rotate it back to center and grab
that hardware which fall into the floor
my husband which is here I can undo now
take these which are here and we are
going to screw them in okay maybe I'll
come back after I screw these in all
right so the vg2 78 has its base
attached now we're gonna go ahead I'm
gonna pull this pin which is going to
allow me to adjust the height oh that's
a pretty robust height adjustment
actually feels very solidly built
actually has been my experience with all
these suits monitors that I've had the
pleasure of using so far build quality
is as I've come to expect from a suit
excellent opening it they're very very
very shiny shiny shiny base all right
overall it's a very shiny monitor not
something that I personally prefer
although a lot of people do like the
shiny thing going on with their
peripherals so I can't can't really
fault them for going that route okay so
over here we've got these blended
buttons blended is basically like a
OneTouch color enhancement button so
it's not gonna be necessarily accurate
colors that splendens going for but it
sort of more like vibrant colors so the
kind of thing that would be good for a
store display where you know if you want
someone to pick your monitor then you
want to show like you want to show off
the full color capabilities of it this
is an LED backlit panel so that's a big
improvement over the previous generation
3d vision monitors I believe there was
only one previous generation LED backlit
3d ready monitor and it wasn't the one
for me Zeus
so asus has added that to its repertoire
what we also have around the edge of the
motor oh look at this matte screen oh I
didn't even notice that before that's
the part about it that is not shiny
which is the critical part now you can
see how little reflectiveness there is
in the screen I'm gonna point it right
at slick and you're not going to be able
to see him because that time at the
screen is that is outstanding
two thumbs up Asus for a matte screen
LED backlit 27 inch 1080p 3d vision
ready monitor which incidentally the
reason it includes the 3d vision 2
glasses is because it supports that's
just design where is it light boost so
that gives you in theory due to the way
that 3d vision 2 operates with inserting
extra frames between the left and the
right image gives you in theory double
the brightness when you're running
stereoscopic 3d applications so I
believe it's a it's a combination
between the monitor boosting it up
whenever you launch something 3d and the
way that 3d vision 2 operates that gives
you that functionality very cool what
else we got in here LED back lamp 120
Hertz it better be 120 Hertz if it's 3d
3d blu-ray ready so that's over hdmi 1.4
and finally tilt swivel and height
adjustments so i'm gonna show you guys
all of that so there is your swivel look
at how far that goes what really does it
go away oh look at that
that's cool so you can actually angle it
any direction you want that's where it
stops I've never seen that before
all right so here's the angle adjustment
oh yeah you want up from the side I
guess that makes sense there you go and
height adjustment is quite height
adjustable ah neat okay so I'm gonna go
ahead and pull the rest of the plastic
off here and then let's have a look at
the inputs and outputs oh oh wait no no
hold on hold on there's yet another
thing that makes this a very very Nvidia
3d vision ready monitor and that is
right here that is your IR emitter you
do not need a standalone IR emitter to
go with this monitor because it is
included all right so let's have a look
at the inputs and outputs which we will
find all on the bottom of the monitor
well no okay I guess we've got our on
screen display first so here are all of
your menu items including selecting your
source navigating the menu all that good
stuff and finally your power button
which has the LED on the front of it
then that's gonna be a good way to show
this hmm
trouble okay here's power
here's hdmi 1.4 DVI VGA please don't use
this and finally there is your audio in
and your headphones out I think that
pretty much covers everything I wanted
to say so in summary 27 inches which is
better and larger and awesomer than
previous generation 3d vision monitors
which makes sense because the new 3d
vision 2 glasses have bigger lenses
which allows you to take in a larger
image without any issues light boosts to
compatibility or light boost to light
boost compatibility a built in 3d vision
IR emitter a matte screen an LED
backlight and that makes for one pretty
wicked looking monitor from Asus don't
