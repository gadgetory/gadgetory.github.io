with the razor Sabretooth this is a
replacement and a more premium option
compared to their previous generation
ons a console controller this works for
Xbox 360 and for PC and they've made a
couple of tweaks to the functionality
that I think gamers are going to enjoy
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Nexus well it doesn't have macro
functionality because they're trying to
maintain their tournament legality it
does have some extra buttons so just
like the ons that you have programmed a
little button so check out here you have
your regular left and right shoulder you
have your analog triggers on the left
and right these two right here are
programmable when I flip it over
aha you have two more programmable
switches that you can trigger with the
fingers that go under the controller
like this so you can rock them back and
forth so you have a total of six
programmable buttons the overall quality
of the controller feels dramatically
better than ons it's extremely rigid
extremely stiff and looks like it can
handle not only being checked around but
also some abuse on the connector the
connector itself actually screws in and
it has a four pin inside that's keyed so
you can only put it in the correct way
you've also got a braided sleeve which
we've come to expect from any sort of
high quality razor component the
accessories that it includes our rubber
caps a carrying case as well as rubber
covers in case you don't want to use
these switches it includes a screw
driver and rubber covers you can take
those off it's totally up to you
programming it is a piece of cake so
you've got two profiles and you can
remap any of the six programmable keys
we're gonna go out of that all you do is
hold this down program or a rather press
this program mode you press the
programmable button you want a program
and then you want to go okay I want to
remap that to X done now you can
customize the controls for your game
regardless of whether the game developer
actually was going to allow you to do
that you switch between your profiles
also if you decide okay look I don't
want any profiles at all I want to go
back to bone stock you hold this down
for five seconds say yeah I want to
totally wipe it it's done
it does have Rumble which of course any
premium controller would these days and
I think that pretty much covers it so
