we're back at HQ and it's time for us to
review the most challenging portion of
$1,500 si PC secret shopper projects
secret agent Magnum I know this is how
all of our competitors responded to a
fairly rudimentary technical support
request I know I just was setting up to
the computer I bought for my brother and
I noticed that in the system it says
there's only 8 gigabytes of memory but
in the order it's supposed to be 16 I
fix its protec toolkit gives you the
tools you need to tackle any electronics
repair challenge visit ifixit.com
forward slash linus at the link below to
get yours today
so first it's our favorite alien work
thank you for calling alien where the
quickest way to get you to the right
support agent is to get your products
Express service code this is different
from your service tag or asset ID I
don't know what my service card would be
is this five minutes already I've just
peered dicking about are we just sitting
here in silence again hello is it me
you're looking forward oh you know
you're not doing on hold right when you
have to come back and say hello are we
15 minutes into this call and they
haven't even gotten as far as who are
you and what do you have are we being
asked for the order number again okay
man just take an agenda and transfer
your call to technical department
we're known as a technical department
yet
thank you for calling your basic
hardware warranty support yeah have your
piston service tag or the Express a with
food you just ask for all our
information again oh my god we're
explaining the problem again oh I'm
extremely sorry to hear that should
happen but you should not have happened
yes okay thank you
astounding observe a shooting
transferred again we have had nearly
half a dozen people that we've talked to
and alienware in pre sales and after
sales support just put us on hold for am
i are you able to guide me through it I
don't actually know that much about
computers then and then she goes through
YouTube and shows us the video about how
to access the memory okay all right well
I'm okay with that
on this video we'll teach you how to
replace your brown modules on the Aurora
r5
nothing beats off billing plastic covers
after you Neal Aurora again to alien
where's credit this system is pretty
straightforward to get at sorry is this
the right video are you looking for a
different one do I need to unplug it
first
no it's oh yeah there you go Genesis
first first Ram swap everyone ladies and
gentlemen
so in summary do I understand this
correctly it took just shy of a full
hour with five separate departmental
transfers to diagnose a ram stick that
came loose during shipping hopefully the
next one can do better here we go
all right Origen show me your leadership
before BC I do need to verify the
information I have once you kill did you
provide me with the address so we have a
problem okay so it took four minutes to
get to the point where we verified the
order and everything that's not terrible
okay well yeah I definitely definitely
see that the invoice says to 8-gigabyte
sticks of Origin PC ddr4 three thousands
of megahertz Ram it's possible that
maybe one of the sticks got loose during
transit possible given the vibrations
that the Machine Co undergoes during
transit you know very possible that one
of the modules came slightly loose
enough you know to not be recognized
this would require you having to
essentially open up your machine so that
you can double check on this are you
familiar with PC hardware to any extent
like would you be able to identify
memory modules on a motherboard probably
not would you be able to help me out
with that kind of problem absolutely you
got the email with the link to the
Dropbox video that's kind of weird why
wouldn't they just host it on youtube I
gotta say alien where's production
values were a little nicer that's
probably not the way that I would show
most users how to do that ideally
putting using both your thumbs to put
equal force on each end of the stick and
you'll feel a very noticeable click his
video 3 out of 10 his instructions solid
9 out of 10 I gotta say Janice for
someone who doesn't seem to have been
doing this before you you've you've done
this a lot faster than some of the most
of the customers I'm on the phone with
so haha smooth operator ah interesting
so we've actually thrown an extra curve
ball at origin PC here plugging the HDMI
connector into the motherboard rather
than our dedicated graphics card oh that
big card has a ribbon cable that goes
from the card itself to the motherboard
and if that came loose slightly then
you're probably not gonna get a picture
this is a good explanation but he's got
the wrong diagnosis let's see how long
it takes him and to clarify when you
initially got picture
do you know whether or not you were
coming out of the graphics card or the
over the onboard video on a motherboard
he's done this before
19 minutes including a detailed
explanation and walkthrough of the
petcock with plugging the monitor into
the on-board IO versus the GPU directly
competent great job thank you for
calling main gear manufacturer of a
would winning pcs and workstation now
this is the real test if they can manage
to turn an order number into like really
the order number would be five or six
digit and start with an eight or nine
okay at least that's clear instructions
all right let me let me remotely connect
to your p2p and I would look at a couple
of things all right pops up device
manager I don't know what he's expecting
to find in device manager he's probably
just kind of like oh I haven't done this
in a little bit
hold on there it is slots used one of
two immediately nails the diagnosis if
you look inside your machine
so ten minutes to diagnosis you should
see a let me go look at your one as well
if I could be more specific
Wow okay nice there should be four or it
could be four or eight but usually it's
for vertical flight
oops it's two and it said that in task
manager I guess they don't sell a lot of
low-end stuff I would usually assume a
main gear system probably has four or
eight computer shut down the computer
I'm gonna have you open up the machine
and we're gonna make sure those things
are in there properly does he mentioned
unplug it though okay so with the
computer shut down I want you to unplug
all the connections from the back all
right rock on main gear guy looks like
that's all it was just a loose Ram stick
but you're you're all set if um running
any other issues feel free to give me a
call back sure thank you so much that's
it
so excluding some random nonsense with
our monitor not properly waking from an
HDMI signal etc about 15 minutes
start to finish
dang one quarter of the time and so much
less frustration like it was just
friendly the voice on the other end of
the line is crystal clear I mean you
can't take that kind of thing for
granted honestly like you could
understand the guy for tech support
press 3 straight to tech support like
why doesn't del have that feature those
thing that complicated
if you feel comfortable looking inside
of the PC remove the left side panel of
the computer pull out the sticks of RAM
and simply repeat them to see if in case
one of them is not data properly
got the diagnosis is that excuse me
mother did I even just hear you
correctly the motherboard I advise you
either you know from so many family
member has a little more experience or
have someone help you remove that stick
around Madrid not everybody has a family
member that can help them that's why
they bought a prebuilt Ammar guy ok I
don't really know who to ask so you
you're not able to like tell me what I'm
looking for six of em are on the
motherboard itself
so is it Those to vertical
he's a brand corner yes
Oh you promised that would be pullin odd
and play it back in but again be careful
with that because if you're on what
you're doing you break something you're
gonna put all your warranty on them
thanks buddy so I just should find
someone else to help me if you have a
family member or friend who's tech savvy
yes it is I by power employing her
friend or family member to provide their
tech support he's just waiting for her
to hang out like hey yeah not a not a
problem to not be very helpful with
anything unreal in Dells defense they
got the problem solved
an hour's investment in getting your new
computer setup or whatever is not the
end of the world given you're gonna run
it for eight or nine years but to just
treat the customer like an idiot and
outright refuse to help them okay and
you're not able to help me through that
not my ability to manage your ability to
look inside Experian I'm familiar with
the part it's gonna be very difficult to
do anything inside of this requires it's
not my ability it's your ability
completely unacceptable I'm ready it
can't be worse than a lien here oh so
they don't even have an easy way to get
in touch with them I actually don't even
mind this form on one condition
it gets best on when someone picks up
the phone they have read and understood
it hold on
I'm transferring you to someone who can
help you now do I have the pleasure of
speaking with today hi my name is Janice
and electing toll camp so he doesn't
have the form what is the purpose of the
farm holy Sh
he's asking for her phone number alright
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
get a hold of the sales department why
to get solutions for your HP product
please hang up and go to WWF port hp.com
where you can troubleshoot or get
software and drivers when your phone
support that you can only call by
finding the number by navigating the
 website tells you to go to the
website your done goofed sorry I still
didn't get that just tell me what kind
of product you're calling about desktop
PC okay we make many types of desktop
PCs you might say something like
pavillion Spectre presario omni
TouchSmart or envy go ahead and tell me
what kind you have omen have your
product model and serial number ready
for your agent hold on
I'm transferring you now okay Janice oh
yeah it looks like they did ship go like
the configuration that shipyard does
actually you have to eat I don't see
issuing 16 like the one they ordered we
personally removed half the memory so
unfortunately all I do tech support I'm
unable to access like a the sales offer
--two look it up but I can't provide you
the number if you'd like so here's the
issue right now every company we talked
to where the rep had an ounce of
experience with PC hardware immediately
identified the problem I'm not imagining
that this is common okay I know that we
were trying to get you over to like the
Canada sales department today send you
back over to us yes
okay what did they end up saying exactly
well they did confirm that like the
order was for 16 gigabytes and then I
got transferred a bunch of times and I
ended up here somehow interesting let me
let me see here
you should have 16 gigabyte right yeah
that's what I thought as well probably
there's the there's a setting that you
need to check or verify that ma'am if
it's acuity I can connect you to Darwin
technical support what setting makes RAM
up here Oh cut the download URL is he
actually gonna start trying to
troubleshoot for us now is this is this
the magic moment 20 minutes in or
whatever let me put you on a brief hold
what I do a little bit more research
here it shouldn't be any more about
probably five to seven minutes or
something we'll be right back with you
okay Dennis thank you for that okay how
long were we on hold for ten minutes
14 twice as long the amount of time we
spend on hold without nothing happening
is the amount of time it took like mania
in order to resolve the whole problem
and the amount of time that Dell spent
in complete and utter silence I don't
know why they ended up actually
transferring you back over to us that
should have been handled on their set of
things in order to get that fixed
because you just stopped the computer is
well before the 30 day mark and
everything like that they should have
been able to get that going to rectify
the issue for you
you had mentioned like looking in the
case and checking or like seeing if I
had the two sticks which I haven't done
I don't know much about computers so I
didn't dare do that should I should I do
that first
again Janus helping out tech support
here what can happen while computers are
being shipped and everything they do get
to moved around and everything so it
could end up being that it just needs to
be unplugged and plug right back in on
both of them because we don't know which
one could be unseated and then it might
actually fix your issue right there as
being able to detect that it has 16
gigabytes after that okay he knows so
here's my issue with this guy because he
has mostly come across as though he
pretty much knows what he's talking
about the issue though is seems to be a
policy one if I had to guess within 30
days its sales problem after 30 days
tech supports problem he just was trying
really hard not to have to do
troubleshooting instead opting to send
free product or push us back to sales
like it's not like they weren't willing
to solve the problem they just didn't
want to diagnose it isn't that weird
like 8 gigs of RAM that's not
insignificant that's like 80 bucks
they were just gonna send it HP managed
to be worse 72 minutes
to get a stick of RAM unseated and
reseeded and HP had the advantage of
Janice already actually knowing how to
pull out and replace memory by this
point are you ready to declare a tie
origin and main gear with shockingly
Dell with that performance taking the
bronze medal here followed by HP who
ultimately did at least solve the
problem with iBUYPOWER in dead friggin
lasts they're not even the best they're
like well they just didn't finish the
math drop ctrl keyboard is constructed
with a solid cnc'd aluminum frame with a
built-in switch plate that makes it very
stable and extremely durable it's fully
programmable with RGB lighting and qmk
firmware which makes it much easier to
program and gives you more control and
at checkout you can choose between
Cherry MX chi-wah and halo switches
which will affect the price depending on
your choice but gives you an incredible
amount of flexibility in terms of the
feel so pick it up today on mass drop
for a limited time through the link in
the video description stay tuned for the
next part where Ivan will be performing
autopsies on all the systems looking in
depth at how the preloaded software came
and all that kind of good stuff in the
meantime though if you guys dislike this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out Lord vile
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description but not yet let us
finish with the autopsies and
performance ok also down there is our
