needs more of and I don't necessarily
mean Corsair SSDs or SSDs in general or
whatever it is that you may think I mean
what I mean is SATA at three six gigabit
per second SSDs so this guy right here
is a 128 gig SSD from Corsair so they
are now the second manufacturer to
market with a SATA three six gigabit per
second SSD and I'm going to tell you why
exactly as part of my unboxing this SSD
needs a SATA three six gigabit per
second interface oh I'm unboxing off
camera there you go you know it said
x-rated unboxing when I can't this is
too too hot for TV for YouTube this
unboxing no sorry you guys can't see it
I'm just gonna I'm gonna look at this
myself oh it's pretty silver yeah it's
got a silver casing on it it comes with
a stick an object just kidding I'll show
you guys okay so first thing it comes
with is a two and a half inch to
three-and-a-half inch adapter lots of
modern cases these days are actually
coming with native support for SSDs or
any two and a half inch drive so you
might not have to use this but if you do
hey it's included so great and here that
is the P 3 128 this is their performance
3 series one of my first SSD videos on
my NCIX comm channel was actually about
their original P 128 so we've come a
fair ways since then this is also a 128
gig but in terms of performance it
absolutely blows the doors off their
older drive so here you can see we've
got our standard two and a half inch
mounting holes on the sides as well as
the bottoms of this drive okay here's a
little warranty void if remove sticker
now this interface is going to look
pretty familiar this is a SATA interface
so your power is still the same old
thing that it's been since SATA one this
guy right here SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second is physically identical to what
we've seen in the past the only
difference is how much thorough put it's
capable of so six gigabit per second
is I mean doing the rough math is about
600 megabytes per second so that means
that it is about double the speed of
SATA to three gigabit per second which
Peaks out at around what is it it's
around 300 megabytes per second I think
it's a little less like about 280 so the
SATA 6 gigabits probably around 560
Meg's so this particular drive doesn't
max it out but if you check out the spec
so I'm on the NCIX website here on my
MSI laptop so here we go maximum
sequential read speeds are 410 megabytes
per second and maximum sequential write
to 210 megabyte per second so it uses a
Marvell controller and they'll see flash
it has trim support as well as a robust
background garbage collection and let's
see what else they've got to say for
themselves three-year warranty on this
guy
Wow the NCI x8 is great it tells me all
the stuff that I could tell you except
in note form rather than watching a long
YouTube video that's pretty useful umm
so one of the questions that inevitably
people will have about a drive like this
is can I use it on my SATA to port the
answer is yes it will have a slightly
lower performance but you can use it on
your SATA to compatible motherboard
until you upgrade to one with SATA 3 6
gigabit per second so don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips and thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
Corsair performance 3 series 128 gig SSD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
