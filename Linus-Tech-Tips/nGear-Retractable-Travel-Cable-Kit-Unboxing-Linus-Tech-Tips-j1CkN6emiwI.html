be unboxing the end gear travel easy
cable day we're not using my normal
camera i'm still experimenting we're
actually borrowing a nikon d90 not the
usual g7 so let's get this thing unboxed
it comes in what looks kind of like a CD
wallet ok so it's gray and black it
comes with a little zipper on the side
so you can actually open it up it looks
just like it does in the photo now it's
got a whole bunch of potentially
life-saving adapters in here first of
all you've got to rj45 Ethernet to us be
a female connectors ok two of those then
you have a USB a male 2 USB a female
little Oh actually cameraman can you
zoom out a little bit to show people how
long this is so this is a USB extension
cable and then you just pull on it it
retracts back in you throw it back into
your little case here ok then you've got
a couple of rj11 so that's phone plugs
to us be a male female and then you have
a USB a male 2 USB a male so this is
what you would use if you're just
plugging into two USB a devices so again
with the extension very cool and that
one yet for tracks all the way in ok
next adapters we've got is this is a
crossover adapter ok so this has our j45
and then again USB a female ok and then
our next adapter is USB a male 2 USB b
mini be there mini be there male Ted
mini be ok that one's not labeled for
whatever reason I couldn't tell you why
and then finally we have yet another
unlabeled adapter and if I knew what
that was I tell you it's going to be
some other kind of USB standard and then
a standard USB a male on the back and
next we have your phone and Mike so this
one is one of those retractable cables
you've got a mic and these are labeled
so the red ones the mic the yellow one
is the earphone and you can actually use
that as an earphone and a mic awesome
you're not going to try and put that one
because it's a little bit trickier okay
next we have USB a to USB am oh I can't
imagine what that adapters for and then
we've got a 13 94 firewire a six male 26
10 males again with the retractable
cable thingamajiggy then we have USB a
to be so there's the a side there's the
b-side you use that typically for
printer so will you be playing directly
into a printer so I'm not sure exactly
when you use it for and then you have a
firewire female to a mini firewire
connector so thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the travel easy kalyan
bag full of every adapter you could
possibly need and then some that you
couldn't possibly need</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
