asou and the gigabyte updated p55
lineups but I haven't actually covered
the one that MSI did so they took their
original P 55 G dat they added five no
what they actually added is SATA 3 which
is six gigabit per second as well as USB
3.0 which is 10 times the speed of USB
2.0 at five gigabit per second so that's
the most important change it still
features crossfire SLI and OC Genie as
well as the super pipe and dr. Moss just
like the p55 G dat but it does come with
these additional updated features it's a
little bit more expensive but without
further ado let's get into the package
so oh it looks like MSI has started
including the N connector which is kind
of like the asou some I think they call
it Q connector either way it's an easy
way to plug in your front USB and front
connectors if you don't have the bunched
up the bunched up block cables okay next
we have a crossfire oh well that's neat
okay well they're actually including a
crossfire bridge I guess because the
spacing is more than the standard
crossfire spacing that's pretty nice
normally you're only going to get a
crossfire bridge with your video card
now we have an SLI video cable so that
is something that we definitely need if
we are running us-ally I'm kind of
rambling here okay I've got an IDE cable
it's red and yellow so it's stylus
next we have two molex to SATA
connectors and four red SATA cables with
locking connectors
awesome next we have two USB ports for
the back of your case these are both
high-speed USB not super speed USB so
that's USB 2.0 and we've got an i/o
shield oh it looks like we've also added
a clear CMOS switch to the back of the
board thumbs up for that I love that
next we have their V chat cables so
these cables plug in to various spots on
the board and allow you to use a
multimeter hmm
use the multimeter to measure the
current voltage there you go just like
that msi explains exactly what it does
drivers and utilities DVD don't use
anything on there download everything
the latest from the msi site a hard disk
storage backup and
or utility okay cool next we have a
quick installation guide which looks
like it's gonna unfold to about the size
of the camera man's office yeah okay so
that gives you a quick guide to CPU Ram
SATA and optical installation or hard
drive and obstacle installation graphics
card installation front panel this is
the useful stuff showing you how to hook
up your front panel connectors and all
that good stuff power and some basic
final settings so that's kind of nice
okay so that quick installation guide is
covered in logos like Auto GSE okay next
we have wow they have so many
accessories ins sheesh okay so control
center guide about MSI is a useful
motherboard useful software okay that's
nice then we have Winky which is their
quick on feature then we have an OC
Genie guide okay Wow they've included so
many more little guides versus the
original G dat it's funny that they
actually even include an OC Genie guide
because OC Genie is by definition of
like a one button function this is like
thick and there's your user guide in
umpteen billion different languages
alright finally we get down to the board
so let's get this out of here let's get
this out of here and let's get this baby
opened up just pull the motherboard out
being careful not to actually touch the
PCB on the back I'm actually touching
the back plate there okay so the
motherboard itself like all p55 boards
we are going to find an LGA 1156 socket
in the middle you can see it's got like
a black mirrored finish on it much like
EVGA high-end boards you can see it's
using a load socket which is the one
that is rated for more even contact with
the CPU so you're not gonna burn out
your CPU and your socket with even
extreme overclocking okay we've got a
couple stickers on here one of them is
for one second overclocking with OC
Genie and the other one is for super
pipe and dr. Moss
okay let's see what else we got here so
like all p55 boards we have support for
dual channel ddr3 up to 16 gigs then
we've got our 24-pin connector and our 8
pin power
connectors in their ideal locations
along the right-hand edge and top left
of the board next we've got out this is
good okay so we've got our V check so
this is going to allow us to check our
CPU CPU vtt ram PCH and then we've got a
couple of ground connections so that we
can actually check up to two at a time
next we've got okay we've got our six
SATA 2 connectors so those are all
running off of the MSI chipset our MSI
Intel chipset then we have SATA 7 and
say 2 8 so those are both SATA 36.0
gigabit per second
connectors next we have an additional
connector I don't even know what that's
running off of probably running off the
same day micron chipset as this IDE
connector here as well as the I'm going
to go ahead and assume that there's an
eSATA port on the back that is also
running off it and it's right there
ok so next we've got all these I love so
oh they've actually improved this so
you've got your power button your reset
button and these are touch sensitive
buttons very cool and then you've
actually got the direct OC buttons which
used to be a physical button kind of
like the OC Genie button here but now
these are touch sensitive to increase or
decrease the base clock pretty cool then
we have three USB 2.0 headers one
firewire header
there's our CMOS battery and then here
we've got our slot so it looks like
they've actually reduced the number of
slots off to Gd 80 but honestly I mean
ok you're going to install 2 graphics
cards so you're gonna still be ending up
with a PCI slot as well as a PCIe 1x
slot even if you have to double slot
graphics cards so really it's enough
expansion options for 99% of people out
there now they've actually cut down on
the heat pipe cooling a little bit which
I can understand because they're adding
features but I mean really I would like
to see something at least as beefy as
the GD 80 I mean if they're saying it's
enough I mean look at this thing it's
huge you've got like this huge heat pipe
you've got all these fins to dissipate
heat realistically it's not gonna get
that hot anyway so MSI seems to have
done a pretty good job there with that
thick heat pipe now let's go around to
the back of the board and have a look at
what we got so we've got two ps2 ports
one for the keyboard one for the mouse a
clear CMOS which I love that I love
having a switch on the back of the board
for that you screw something up you just
press that button and sets everything
back to factory default
next we have optical as well as coaxial
audio out then we have firewire four six
USB 2.0 ports remember this is one of
those SATA esata/usb combo ports very
cool ports then we have 2 USB 3 ports 2
Gigabit Ethernet as well as 7.1 audio so
this is a fully featured board SLI
crossfire the works and thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the p55 GT
