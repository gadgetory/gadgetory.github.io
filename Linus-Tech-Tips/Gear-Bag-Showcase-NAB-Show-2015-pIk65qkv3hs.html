in the past what we bring to cover shows
like packs and CES so since nab is one
of the biggest shows for production gear
I thought it would be fitting to show
you guys what Brooke reline will be
shooting with for the show so let's get
into it
the Coolermaster Nova touched tkl
utilizes genuine Tokra hybrid capacitive
switches and is now available at a more
affordable price click now to learn more
starting with my camera back back this
is the Tenma roadie video backpack I
absolutely loved this thing as it stores
an enormous amount of gear while also
protecting all of my gear when we need
to be on the move in the top pocket we
have all of our audio gear we always
bring along Sennheiser g3 s as our
wireless audio solution these little
packs have been the main reason we can
get any sort of quality audio while on
the show floors from monitoring audio we
have a set of Sennheiser HD 280 s these
will be great for when we're back at the
hotel editing as well as monitoring
audio while we're on site for that nice
reference sound moving on to our main
mic for NAB the Sennheiser mk4 which is
what I'm actually using to record this
video this is the first time I am using
this mic in the field and so far it's
been great with a very radio like
quality to it and a handy XLR input on
the bottom allowing me to record
directly into my zoom h6 recorder moving
into camera setups I will be bringing my
Blackmagic pocket Cinema Camera in a
view factor cage with a meta bones speed
booster in order for me to use my Canon
EF mount glass on it Burke will be using
a Panasonic gh4 a 4k shooting powerhouse
of a mirrorless camera with the why agh
attachment from when we need to run
audio on site for lens mount the gh4 has
a standard meta bones adapter for using
electronic EF lenses speaking of lenses
here are the two lenses I will always
bring for shows the Tamron 2470 F 2.8
and the Sigma 18 to 35 F 1.8 between
these two lenses they strike the right
balance between versatile zoom range and
fast apertures for all different kinds
of lighting situations when we are on
the show floor for power I have three
into circuit power banks that I mount
onto my cage with this little C clamp
I love these battery banks since they
last forever and are a lot cheaper than
other battery solutions for my
Blackmagic for the gh4 burka we'll be
using a anton bauer gold mount battery
to power the gh4 with the audio solution
attached for stabilization I will be
using a Manfrotto nvm 500 video monopod
this is the monopod of choice for many
content creators on the move it's a
great way to stay quick on our feet
while still getting some solid shots I
wouldn't be able to get using the camera
handheld Brooke will be using a
similarly lightweight setup with the
carry speed mogul pod with a man photos
701 tripod head last but certainly not
least for camera media we are using
Kingston 64 gig SD cards which are great
because they give us the necessary write
speeds for both cameras and will prevent
the need for changing out cards too
often when we're shooting on the floor
for editing I'll be using our msi gs70
which I really like thanks to its
lightweight form factor but reasonably
large display for use with premiere
Burke will be using a Venom black book
an equally capable notebook for our
needs on this trip that will not weigh
us down too much in travel and that's
everything nothing too crazy we like to
keep ourselves fairly lightweight for
show coverage like this I hope you guys

forward to all of our upcoming NAB
