gonna be doing a build log that's gonna
be a little different from anything else
that we've ever done before I will be
doing the ultimate space-saving PC by
not just building a computer into a tiny
case but having no case at all building
a computer into the bottom of a desk
it's going to be awesome
so I bought pretty much all the hardware
that I'm using on mcmaster-carr those
guys have almost everything under the
Sun you can get L brackets and all kinds
of different shapes and sizes see I've
got all kinds of different kinds that I
that I measured out in terms of what I
needed you can get screws in pretty much
any length and thread so I had to gather
up a bunch of the different kinds of
screws as well as these cool housings
I'll show you how I'm going to use those
later there was one thing that I was not
able to get on mcmaster-carr though and
it was this this is motherboard
standoffs now I could have just selvage
these from a case we have lying around
but I wanted this build log to be to
reflect how you guys would go through
the process and you might not have those
lying around so I got those on Amazon
we've got our Asus GeForce GTX 980 TI
Strix that they sent over for this video
this will give us some gaming capability
even though this is like a stealth type
of build well not just some gaming
capability I mean pretty much as good as
it gets the motherboard will be using
the stylish saber-tooth z97 mark s from
Asus this is for a couple of reasons
number one I've used this board before
and it's fine
which is good number two is I actually
really liked the idea of having this
protective shield over top of the top of
my motherboard in this case because on
the bottom of the desk it could happen
that I could accidentally touch it
somehow and the motherboard would be the
worst thing in the system pretty much to
shore it out so their thermal armor
comes in handy
once for the RAM we went with some
matching Kingston HyperX fury Ram this
is a two stick
kit total of 16 gigs mostly we just went
with the white Ram because we caught the
white board and what the hey why not and
on the subject of what the hey why not I
dug out our white ax 860 I power supply
from Corsair that I actually painted
back when we did our sub-zero build
guide so to go with that though as you
guys may or may not have noticed this is
not a standard case and the power supply
might not actually be able to reach all
the components with the standard cables
so I reached out
our buddies over at cable mod who hooked
us up with some custom length white
individually sleeved cable mod cables
yeah these are gonna come in handy for a
build like this this is the Intel Core
i7 a 5775 see this is a broad well based
desktop CPU and basically it's an
upgrade for anyone who's using a z97
platform already and with one of the big
improvements over the previous has well
based chips being that it has much
better onboard graphics to cool it will
be using an H one hundred-eyed GTX I
think we were actually planning to use a
110 i GTX originally but whether it's
due to you know the 100 I using 120
millimeter fans and therefore being
slightly lower profile or whether it's
because of course they forgot to ship us
one of those I'm not sure we're using
this one now and finally as much for
show as it is for performance we'll be
using two Intel 730 series SSDs in this
case we've got a couple of 480 gigs
that'll give us a total of 960 gigabytes
of raid 0 SSD storage for this rig oh
yeah we've got some Noctua fans for the
cooler there and here's our next
component to LG ultra wide 34 inch
monitors so these are the 34 you c87 see
the main difference between these and
the one that i've used in the past being
that it has a height adjusts and note
that that matters because we'll be using
a modified herbal tron desk mount like
individual stands that's actually got a
widescreen gaming forum Edition upgrade
to it with like a bolt through on the
desk so that's gonna be pretty sick step
number one after setting up our
workstation being all you know safe and
clutter free of course no actually all
this is stuff that we're working on is
gonna be to actually redo my test fit
just to make sure that when we start
drilling because we will be drilling for
this build log everything is in exactly
the right place for components like the
power supply graphics card and
their board we're gonna need to be extra
careful that we're leaving enough room
for IO because depending on what type of
table you have you might have some kind
of a reinforcing lip around the outside
that if you position your IO ports too
close to might make it impossible to
plug in any USB connectors so definitely
watch out for that another pro tip is
when you're mounting something like a
power supply you're gonna want to make
sure that even if normally you would go
fan side down now you go fan side up
because otherwise you're not gonna have
any cooling for that particular
component this is well actually it's a
pair of PCI Express extenders and these
are one of the very common tools in the
toolbox for people who do wall mounted
pcs or other sort of unusual form factor
pcs you can usually get away with up to
about 30 centimetres of extension from a
PCI Express 16x slot without seeing any
degradation in performance as long as
they're of sufficient quality so we'll
be using these in order to mount our
graphics card there we go
flat against the table just like that
fan positioning is going to be kind of
personal choice you'll have to decide do
you want the slightly warm breeze
blowing towards your legs or do you want
it blowing away from it neither is gonna
offer any tangible benefit or
disadvantage in terms of cooling so you
can go whatever route you want I'm gonna
go with blowing the air away from my
legs just in case they're feeling a
little chilly
now before I finalize where all of the
components are going to go I need to go
ahead and put my custom cables on and
make sure that both I sent cable mod the
right measurements and they made the
cables to my exact specifications
because you might have to make some
slight adjustments to where we're
positioning things otherwise
there's our 8 pin CPU connector look at
this thing ah now just because the
cables are going to be hidden away under
a desk doesn't mean that's any excuse to
have crappy cable management so the way
that I've planned out the build is to
have one mass of individually sleeve
cables come out of the power supply and
then work its way up this edge of the
desk splitting out as needed to the
different parts of the motherboard and
the rest of the components so the PCI
Express connectors for example will come
out along over in a straight line and
then down and the way that I plan to
achieve these nice straight lines is
using these base stage cable ties this
episode not brought to you by Baystate
cable ties but basically these are just
anchors that can have zip ties go
through them two different ways and that
can screw down into the tabletop surface
so that I have a really strong anchor
point and I can really get those cables
nice and tight and straight so for me
the only thing that's really important
back there in terms of spacing is making
sure I have enough room for a normal
standard USB cable now that I've traced
the outline is actually going to be to
trace the positions of the mounting
holes so the next step involves our
drill and these little puppies right
here we're going to be using these in
order to be able to install our
standoffs well into the bottom of a
table surface
Wow I'm gonna hit my head on that a lot
of times look at that we have a
rock-solid mount for our motherboard to
the bottom of the table here very very
nice lower the cover lower the arm and
then go put your socket cover in a safe
place if you ever need to arm a your
motherboard you'll need to find that now
even though it means the radiator might
get in my way a little bit later I'm
going to go ahead and mount the CPU
block now this way I can ensure that my
radiator position is gonna be correct
when I install it and that I'm not going
to be putting too much strain on the
tubing Dennis I don't want to jinx it
but I'm amazed at how well this is going
so far okay so one slightly tricky thing
with getting our video card mounted
towards the the back of the table so
that we're less likely to accidentally
bump it is that there's not a whole lot
of room for our DisplayPort cable to go
into the back of our graphics card
before we screw down the graphics card
we're going to pre install the bulky
DisplayPort cables these are pretty much
the largest cables that we'll have to
plug into the back of our motherboard
the last hole we need to drill for the
graphics card is actually going to be in
the plastic of the shroud now this is
not a mounting technique that you're
gonna find in any kind of proper guide
but basically we'll be drilling a hole
that's slightly smaller than the
threading of our screw and we'll be
using just a normal screw as a
self-tapping screw because the material
is going into is so soft I spoke too
early there is still actually one thing
we need to drill on the graphics card
and this one's a little bit scary we
have to drill a hole
in the bottom of the PCI bracket to go
with that one that we have in the top so
for the next step I actually need
something I forgot to mention there
these are 632 nuts
we're gonna put some threadlocker onto
the screws that we're putting into them
because I forgot washers washers would
be another another option here now
something we could do to get a firmer
mount with our radiator is install
another couple brackets on the other
side but frankly it's so far out of the
way that I'm really not that worried
about it it's just the kind of thing
that you could do if you wanted more
peace of mind so for mounting the SSDs
I'm using these ones with the hole on
the one side and the slot on the other
and then I'm actually going to overlap
two of them just like that for the
middle and then put additional ones on
the outsides of the SSDs
this was more luck than anything else
but with our configuration the included
SATA cables actually ended up working
out perfectly not just with the color
scheme black and white and sometimes red
but also in terms of length so we're
just going to run these puppies through
our existing cable management loops that
we've run and plug them into the board
this switch that I pulled off of an old
case some time ago so I'm just going to
mount that up under the you know bottom
of the table not really anything special
and all that's left now is basically
just a few finishing touches so we're
gonna install our memory and then plug
our fan cables into the leads off of the
Corsair all-in-one liquid cooler plug
that into the motherboard and we're
pretty much ready to flip this puppy
over and start working on the other side
of the desk there are some more
finishing touches here I'm gonna start
cinching tight all of the cable
management giving it a bit of a cleaner
cleaner overall look once we're done
not bad not bad at all I mean this
actually went really well okay so all
that's left now is to flip it over and
you have got to be kidding me the whole
thing is backwards
the chair slides in this way the
DisplayPort cables are going to come up
right under the keyboard Dennis I don't
want to jinx it but I'm amazed at how
well this is going so far
you know what we might be able to take
the whole leg assembly off and put it on
the other way
I think it's symmetrical okay no we have
a plan all right let's try it thank you
modular IKEA furniture all right so all
that's really left now is to flip her
over and find out if she works I
actually forgot the other really awesome
thing about this model compared to the
one that I reviewed the vase amount is
now included thank you instead of having
to use a weird janky accessory for it
awesome basically all we do is screw the
thing into the thing put this thing on
top of this thing do a test mount with
our monitors to ensure that the height
is correct mount them permanently by
screwing those base amounts that are
included with the Ergo tech slash
widescreen gaming forum stand here in
and then clipping them over these rails
and locking them into place once they're
there you can actually make fine
adjustments to them by using the yeah
there they are
the knobs that are on the bottom but
it's recommended that you try and get
things as close as you can before that
and then start plugging in all of the
connectors for the back of the
motherboard as well which as you can see
are able to just barely plug in which is
exactly how we intended it okay here it
is our mouse is charging there we go so
moment of truth didn't go so well it
looks like my white saber tooth may not
have survived the sub-zero experiment
and yeah so we're gonna take another
crack at things with our black saber
tooth z97 mark 1 and see if it goes a
little better this is something to
consider if you are thinking about
building a desk PC though and that's
that maintenance is not going to be
quite as easy as it used to be actually
I guess I could have flipped the desk
over you've got to be kidding me
moment of truth it's so quiet is it even
hot hey hey oh okay so I think it's time
to do a recap then for y'all because we
ended up having to change a couple
things so number one thing that we
changed was our PCI Express power
connectors it looks like we got a couple
of bunk ones these kinds of things
happen at least it wasn't the eight pin
because and this was serendipitous the
other thing that didn't work was two of
these PCI Express extensions at the same
time maybe the ones we got were not
actually shielded or whatever else was
the issue but one of them is working
fine but that meant I had to turn my
graphics card around so being able to
use shorter cable mod cables that I
already had lying around ended up
working just fine and I was able to use
some of the extra brackets that I bought
to remount the graphics card with about
an inch of space between it and the
table which is actually not that bad and
better in some ways because now at least
you can't accidentally put your knee or
ax or a finger into the fan on the
bottom of the card so that is it my
friends it worked
