look at SLI scaling on the gtx 550 ti
now sli has been a big story for nvidia
since they first released it with the
6800 series however not every not every
card necessarily makes sense to run in
sli so i've always been of the mind that
if there is a better card than the one
that you have that is as good as two of
the one that you have running in sli
you're probably usually better off to go
with the single more powerful card
versus the two slower weaker cards
running in sli so I wanted to take a
quick snapshot of some DirectX 11 titles
so the ones that I've gone with our
Hawks to Lost Planet 2 and metro 2033
and I compared four different scenarios
so I compared a single gtx 550 ti
cyclone 2 so that is a slightly
overclocked card I compared that running
an SLI with a gtx 550 ti reference card
i compared a gtx 560 Twin Frozr 2 so
once again this is a slightly
overclocked card but since neither of
these carry a price premium over the
reference cards I see no reason to
necessarily bench with reference cards
and the last one that I included was the
gtx 570 so the reason i've gone this
route is that the cost of a single 550
ti is well significantly lower than
anything else on the table however the
cost of two of them together actually
lends somewhere in between a 560 and a
570 s so that's why i wanted to test the
single GPUs that are available on either
side of the price bracket of this dual
GPU solution now the upgrading guys will
say well yeah but what if I wanted to
upgrade to one later then my response
would be well then what you really
should have done was saved a couple
extra bucks to buy something else in the
first place if you need more performance
than buy something with more performance
so here we go why don't we have a look
at the benchmarks that I was able to run
here and we'll start with
- so in Hawke's - you can see that the
gtx 550 ti at about 85 frames per second
actually scales incredibly well in this
particular game so that's like 90%
scaling or so and actually performs
right exactly where it's supposed to be
in between the 560 TI and the 570
however even this is an ideal scenario
an ideal scenario has the 550 ti
performing about where it should in
terms of the pricing of this solution so
you're gonna see that the problem with
SLI is that it doesn't always scale in
an ideal fashion so right here our 550
performs about where it should with
respect to a 560 and even a 570 but the
SLI solution while costing more than a
560 and consuming more power than a
single 560 actually doesn't even perform
as well and remember the 550 ti SLI
solution is about as expensive as in
between these two so really it should be
right in between them it should be
around 50 fps but it's uh it's about 10
to 12 percent slower than that in Lost
Planet 2 and now let's have a look at
the last one that I ran here which is a
metro 2033 benchmark so here I've got it
running at normal quality with
tessellation on and 0 times
anti-aliasing all of these benchmarks
are at 1920 by 1200 by the way so you
can see the 550 ti is right here 550 ti
SLI really doesn't scale that well
compared to where it should be which is
around 90 fps so once again we're
looking at like a 20 percent performance
Delta difference between where it should
be to justify the price versus where it
is when it doesn't scale quite as well
as it could so I basically the
conclusion of this is that the 550 ti if
you do buy one and you find yourself
needing some more performance yes you
can get additional performance and you
can go from what I would consider basic
playable to very very playable and a
demanding game like metro 2033 at full
HD resolution however if you know you
need the performance you're going to be
playing demanding game
at HD resolution then just get a 560 TI
do yourself a favor and buy the right
card in the first place because even
though once in a while and this is sort
of the exception not the rule the 550 ti
SLI set up will outperform a 560 ti
you're going to get a more consistent
overall experience with a single more
powerful card versus two more
entry-level cards running in tandem so
