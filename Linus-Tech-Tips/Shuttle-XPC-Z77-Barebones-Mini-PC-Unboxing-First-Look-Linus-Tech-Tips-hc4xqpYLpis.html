shuttle XP see bare-bones pc i love
these things as you guys have probably
figured out by now i think they're a
fantastic idea and a great way to build
a small form factor pc in the most
simple possible way and it's not just a
great way to build a small form factor
pc it's a great way to build a pc in
general if you're enthusiasts who wants
to build their own pc but you're an
enthusiast who doesn't have the
knowledge necessarily to do some of the
more complicated parts of system
assembly like installing the motherboard
connecting the front panel headers
connecting the power supply correctly to
the motherboard all of this kind of
stuff there we go so the shuttle XP see
bare-bones kits actually make all of
that stuff simpler while leaving the
main configuration parts of the system
so that is the CPU memory the drive the
graphics card you want to use totally up
to you and for you to install and then
they also include a colored quick start
guide to help you get started so here is
the the general basic shuttle chassis
that they're using these days it has a
five and a quarter inch Bay which is
with them matter of a couple minutes you
can get it hooked up to the front button
on your optical drive you've got a three
and a half inch hot front drive front
bakes you can use for like a card reader
or something like that power switch hard
drive indicator LED as well as your fun
panel head ports so you have two USB 3 2
USB two headphone and microphone ports
all built into the front with a nice
sleek brushed aluminum finish the top is
also brushed aluminum the sides are also
brushed aluminum and they look can you
see the brush pneus yeah there you go
and you got ventilation holes all along
the sides because that is the only place
where you're going to have air being in
taken in order to be 0 is you trying to
look at those sorry guys and then it
will be exhausted by the ninety two
millimeter fan at the back as well as
the 40 millimeter fan built into the
power supply there's your power
connector here are your onboard display
oh so there's DVI which supports vga
Vienna doctor
you can tell because it's a dvi-i and
then HDMI we've got USB 2 times 4 times
as well as one esata USB 3 that's
running off the Intel chipset so that's
going to be nice high speed USB 3
Gigabit Ethernet as well as 5.1 audio
out that's the 5.1 that looks like 7.1
sorry guys alright let's open this up
and see what shuttle has done on the
inside in terms of configuration for
this system you can see it's only three
screws to get it opened up thumb screws
of course shuttle does want to make this
as simple as they can because they are
designed for novice brothers and
experienced builders alike on the inside
it's pretty straightforward again all we
need is a screwdriver here to take out
all the drive base so you can see
there's our five and a quarter inch as
well as our two three and a half inch
drive base so if you do install an
external three-and-a-half inch device
like I showed you before you will
sacrifice one of your potential internal
three and a half inch mounting Bay's
hold on there we go got it there you go
just on Luminum piece right there fairly
straightforward once you get it bolted
in at the top it loses a lot of that
flex so it's going to be perfectly
sturdy for installing your drives here
inside you see they've already done most
of the complicated connections for use
but things like the front panel USB 3
the front panel connectors like your
power switch your reset switch your
there is no reset switch pardon me but
your front LED than whatnots you've also
got what else is plugged in the CPU fan
is already plugged in although you'll
probably have to take that off in order
to install the CPU so to install the CPU
is quite simple all you have to do is
take out these four thumb screws pull
out the custom heat pipe cooler that
shuttle uses to cool their ex pcs so you
got three heat pipes going up here to
the 92 Mme turf and that does most of
the exhaust for the system so due to the
fact that they use a a single fan here
and then one small fan in the power
supply shuttles are actually quite quiet
even compared to compared to something
like a performance desktop in spite of
the fact that you can still put a lot of
performance inside a shuttle so in terms
of say that upgrade options we've got
one two three
for SATA ports two of them are say 236
gigabit per second so fully ready for
the latest high performance SSDs and two
of them are SATA 3 say two to three
gigabit per second now speaking of high
performance a SSDs you can install an
msata SSD if you want to use it here for
Intel SRT caching to go along with your
boot drive or any other drive in your
system and then you can also install a
mini PCIe card so they've got support
for both of those built right into this
very small form-factor motherboard now
in terms of expansion slots we've got a
pcie 16x as well as a PCIe for x so you
can install up to a dual-slot high
performance graphics card and we've
actually been able to fit a radeon HD
7970 into one of these shuttles with no
issues in fact side we never actually
ran the card last time but we should
totally do that with the z77 board we
should throw a compatible intel
processor inside here quad core and then
we'll throw 79-78 and see how it fares
actually here is the vrm cooling and
here is one of the things about this
machine that is most unique and most
special this is a 500 watt 80 plus
bronze power supply in this form factor
look at how small this thing is oh I'm
gonna do it I'm gonna do it wait for it
wait for it taken out of my battery case
oh yeah this thing is so small that the
only suitable comparison is the iphone
comparison that is how big it is there
you go Wow 33 rails on the 12 volt total
real meat okay I think that pretty much
covers the general unboxing and overview
thank you for checking out this video
and don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from unboxings reviews and
other computer videos sorry guys I was
just firing this up for the for the test
that I want to do here and I realized I
totally didn't show you guys some of the
internals here so we've got a front
floppy connector we've got two molex
4-pin peripheral connectors we have four
SATA power connectors and finally we
have a six plus two and a 6-pin
connector so we have full support
high-performance graphics cards another
thing that I totally forgot to show you
guys is the fact that it includes the
power cord if you include didn't even go
through the accessories to SATA cables a
slot cover all the mounting screws you
need as well as a couple cable ties
thermal compound as well as never
actually remembering which I intended to
do although I didn't promise you guys
I'd do it never actually remembering to
take out the color installation guide
which wall look at that they included in
a bunch of different languages too which
shows you how to do things in color that
is all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
