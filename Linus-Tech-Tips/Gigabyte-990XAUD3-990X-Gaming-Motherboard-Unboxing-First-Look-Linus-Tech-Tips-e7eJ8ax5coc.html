this is a 2011 performance motherboard
see very strange way to brand it given
that the bulldozer CPUs are fully
supported by this particular board so
it'll perform just fine in 2012 as well
so yeah ok moving on unlock performance
we means we have full support for aim 3
+ unlocked FX processors from AMD this
is a 9 series chipset so that means we
do have support for crossfire all 50000
our Japanese solid caps with 3x USB
power USB 3 and SATA 3 that is the 3 3 3
onboard acceleration we also have
support for 3 terabyte plus hard drives
with the dual BIOS hybrid EFI technology
do BIOS also means that if your BIOS is
corrupted during a flash you can reflash
it using the other physical BIOS chip
located on the board we have 8 + 2 phase
power ultra-durable 3 classic and the
3-year warranty in the US and Canada so
that's more like 3 3 3 3 3 3
alright on the back we see not a whole
lot that we didn't already find out on
the front so let's go ahead and open her
up it does support the on/off charge
feature which allows you to charge your
iPhone even if the board is powered down
very cool
alright we have a utility DVD as well as
a manual next we have an SLI bridge
black flexible bridge my personal
favorite alright we have a right angle
and straight SATA cable times 2 so 2
right angle and two straight save a 3 6
gigabit per second cables we have a
color-coded IO shield very handy and
finally we have a multilingual
installation guidebook oh no not finally
wait there's more we have a gigabyte
powered sticker as well as a Dolby home
theater sticker I'm not going to even
try and get that over there there
alright let's have a look at the
motherboard itself so this is a pretty
typical gigabyte AMD platforms
motherboards color scheme so we have a
blue PCB with white and how does the
looks
there we go slots there we are so we
have a black CPU socket that means
support for am3+ we've also got these
standard mounting brackets so no matter
whether you have an a.m. 2 a.m. 3 or a 3
plus CPU heatsink it will fit very good
stuff there's our 8 + 2 phase power
design and our vrm heatsink our 8 pin
power connector is located in its ideal
location on the top left corner and we
have support for Fordham's in dual
channel off to the right here they are
color-coded for easy dual channel
operation our 24-pin connector is along
the right-hand edge of the board in its
ideal location and we have 6 say the 3 6
gigabit per second SATA slot the ports
running off of the AMD chipset very
handy love to see that feature 6 SATA 3
remember there is no Intel chipset
currently that supports more than 2 say
2 3 6 gigabit per second parts off the
chipset itself we have our front panel
connectors front panel USB we have an
extra power USB port remember that is
ideal for connecting and charging your
iPad using the utility we have two more
front USB connectors trusted platform
module we've got firewire and front
audio connectors also here another thing
to note is that we do have full support
for nvidia sli as well as ATI crossfire
X in spite of the fact that this is
merely a 990 X board rather than being a
990 FX bar it has a great PCI slot
layout so let's go ahead and have a look
so we've got two PCIe 1x 2 PCI 1 PCIe 4x
this is physical 16x but is only wired
up to 4x here and then we have a 16 X
and an 8x slot here so these guys are
going to run in 8 X 8 X mode for SLI but
please note that actually doesn't matter
even on very high end graphics cards
you're not going to see a significant
performance degradation from running
them in 8 X 8 X mode if you installed
two dual slot parts you're going to be
left with one PCI one PCIe one and one
PCIe 4x slot for expansion that's a
great layout gives you all kinds of
options you can go you know Revo drive
sound card and legacy card no problem
alright moving on to the back of the
board we have 1 2 3 4 5 6
7:8 USB 2.0 ports those are all high
powered 3x power ports meaning you can
plug them into a hub and run several
high powered devices off of them
we have ps2 keyboard and mouse combo
port we have optical audio out firewire
2 USB 3.0 ports Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1
audio out so I'd say this board is great
for a value type configuration throw 8
to 16 gigs of ram in there throw an SSD
and a hard drive on there it does have
support from dual graphics cards but
because it is 16 X or 8 X 8 X some
people might not be comfortable
installing to high-end parts so 2 value
cards or one high-end card is a great
choice for this and I'm very excited
about the upcoming bulldozer CPUs which
are fully supported by this board don't
