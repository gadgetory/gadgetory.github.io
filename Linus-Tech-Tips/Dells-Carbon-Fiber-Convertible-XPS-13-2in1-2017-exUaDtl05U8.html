one a lot so much in fact that I made
this video that never got released
because my hair looked awful
other than some screen burnin issues
it's been a fantastic machine and it's
still in service today partly because
since then there hasn't been anything
quite like it
more recent XPS 12 2 and ones have been
Asus Transformer style tablets with
detachable keyboards well no more a
proper super compact 2 and one is back
the Dell XPS 13 93 65 2 + 1 2017 or as
I'm christening it the Folden Atrix 9000
because Dells name for it is terrible
anchors Power Core 5000 is a two-in-one
portable charger and wall charger
featuring five thousand milliamp hours
of capacity check it and their
Valentine's promotion out at the link
below
the Folden Atrix 9000 comes out ahead of
its predecessor in most ways build
quality is a step up with an aluminum
and carbon fiber shell that manages to
get lighter and thinner without losing
any of that quality feel so the Razer
Blade stealth no longer stands out from
other Ultra portables at the starting at
999 price point the screen is far from
color accurate out of the box but it's
bright with great contrast and Del's
trademark infinity edge that gives this
13 inch device a much smaller footprint
than even modern competitors like the HP
Spectre x-360 2017 a 13 inch - and one
that I covered here it's very very total
and the performance compromise is much
less than I expected
Dell claims that by dynamically boosting
the power delivery to the processor they
have overcome the disappointing
performance of last generation super low
power Intel y series devices while still
achieving a fanless cooling solution and
I'm impressed it won't hold up to
sustained gaming loads with an external
Thunderbolt 3 video card as well due to
its lower clock speeds and inferior
cooling but on battery the XPS comes
within spitting distance of the X 360
which supports a much faster on paper
core i7 7500 you though nothing in life
is free and it should also be noted that
the battery life for both machines ended
up being very similar as well and on top
of that neither of them is capable of
smooth 4k YouTube video playback without
running into CPU bottlenecking from time
to time
let's talk hinge the Sat
spying but probably fragile and
expensive to manufacture ferris-wheel is
dead and the industry seems to have
collectively decided a 360 degree yoga
style hinge is the way to make a single
device operate in laptop tablet mode or
somewhere in between so it comes down
then to who makes the best one and Dells
is good if a little underwhelming next
to the x360 they both have wonderfully
smooth action but HP managed to achieve
a one finger lift while the XPS is
actually kind of challenging to pry open
I oh is another trade-off perspective
XPS buyers will need to consider I've
accepted that I'll need to carry Type C
dongles for the rest of my life but I do
wish that like the x360 it had at least
one full size type a port in case I
forget the speakers are loud and sound
quality good for an ultra portable and
the webcam is mostly decent with a very
good array mic but if you use yours a
lot you might not like its position at
the bottom of the screen you end up with
that creepy looking down at you
expression that isn't present on
competing models like the ex 360 2017
more good news though the onboard
two-by-two Wi-Fi knocked my freaking
socks off this is the first time I've
seen consistent 50 megabyte per second
transfers on a laptop it's using a year
old chipset from Intel so it must just
be a very excellent antenna design which
brings us finally to the bad news I'm
not a huge fan of the bottom half of the
clamshell the fingerprint sensor is fast
and accurate but it really needs to be
backlit so I can find it in the dark and
an IR camera here instead would be a
welcome improvement next time around the
touchpad has a consistent click field
below the top quarter and is much better
with the speed turned down a notch and
the palm rejection delay adjusted to
quick but it still jitters too much
operated two-handed I give it a B+ as
for the keyboard it's not terrible or
anything
the layout is mostly pretty good
especially considering how little space
they had to work with but there's also
not much that I like about it the soft
touch finish combined with the very
spongy tactile feel of the switches
gives it a feeling kind of like typing
on a sofa number row inputs register
incorrectly when you press keys too
quickly and I hate hate hate the arrow
key layout page up page down home and
end should be handled with function +
arrows and don't need dedicated keys
this was really frustrating just about
every other time I wanted to move the
cursor one spot I ended up scrolling the
whole page with that said the folded HX
9000 is a pretty cool little two-in-one
it's fanless delivers top-notch battery
life comes equipped with Thunderbolt 3
is reasonably priced and does all of
this with a 360 degree hinge something
you might not end up using that much
because it's still pretty heavy to use
as a tablet but with how little now that
you're giving up
compared to previous convertibles for
that hinge hey it might be time for
traditional notebook users to consider
converting yeah I'll show myself oh
speaking of tools for the job it's
summer
apparently something-something boarding
planes trains driving a car or leave
