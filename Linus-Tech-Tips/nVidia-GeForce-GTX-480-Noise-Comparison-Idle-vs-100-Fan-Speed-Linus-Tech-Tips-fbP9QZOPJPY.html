here with a core i7 975 extreme edition
EVGA classified some high-speed muskan
memory I got the OCZ vertex le 200 gig
SSD so this is a pretty pretty cool
system anyway
I'm just installing Crysis warhead right
now and I've also just got an EVGA s
precision tool installed and I've had
quite a few people ask me about the
acoustics of the of the GTX 480 okay so
here we go I'm gonna set the fan speed
to a hundred percent now I want to give
you some idea of what it's like when
you're running a game and when you're
not running a game but this is just to
show you what it will sound like when
it's running out a hundred percent so
the span speed is 45 until I hit apply
45 percent and the GPU temperature is 40
degrees at idle now I'm gonna go ahead
and click apply over there and remember
this system has an optical drive running
full bore in the background so I'm gonna
get close to that so you can hear the
noise level and that's most of what
you're hearing right now now just also
for context I'm gonna go ahead and turn
the intel stock cooler onto performance
mode
okay so that's what that sounds like it
doesn't make much of a difference so
here we go I'm gonna kick the GTX 480
here into hi here yeah that's pretty
loud now I'm not sure that it'll
actually run at that speed while you're
gaming but like I can feel the air
blowing out the back of the card here
it's um it's pretty incredible anyway so
there you go
here I'll turn it back down to 45 before
before I stopped filming here and it
wasn't actually the EVGA precision so
it's funny if even if you set the fan
speed not to auto so there we're back to
45 even if you set the fan speed not to
auto okay so you take auto off and you
try and turn it down it won't let you
turn it down any lower than 34 I believe
yeah 34 is the lowest you can go and
when you're at 34 wow you can see the
GPU temperature went down three degrees
just from having it on 100% for a little
while now it's creeping its way back up
but yeah here's what it sounds like a 34
so thank you for checking out my video
on the acoustics of the GTX 480</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
