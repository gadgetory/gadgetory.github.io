to say we've received literally hundreds
of requests to weigh in on the
controversy surrounding red digital
cinema and the expensive proprietary red
mini mag media format that they sell for
use in their cameras now it recently
came to light through Ginnie Meg a maker
of third-party non-certified Meg's that
contrary to what red has been telling us
over the years the red mini mag is in
fact not a special product that was
developed after countless hours of R&amp;amp;D
but rather a simple consumer SSD with an
interface adapter in a fancy enclosure
now I had assumed that people would lose
interest in this story and I decided to
just leave it alone
but it's escalated to the point where
Genie Tech's original video has gone
viral to the point where red CEO Jarrod
land has had to issue statements to the
media defending Reds position and its
products so then it's time to break our
silence and break this down for y'all
starting of course with a breakdown of
our own 960 gig mini mag time for some
surgery brought to you by the corsair
hydro x Corsairs new hydraulic series of
custom cooling components includes water
blocks reservoirs fittings adapters and
more check them out at the link below
to kick things off we're gonna need a
torx number six bit to remove the four
screws on the bottom of our red mini mag
step to pry open the aluminum enclosure
step 4 remove the interface adapter
which as you guys can see is just a
simple pin to pin connection and adaptor
it's there's no logic built into it
whatsoever and step four five I don't
know whatever step run inspect the SSD
which is there's your controller there's
your D Ram cache and there's one two
three four five six seven eight NAND
flash module so this is a high-capacity
red Meg the store fly 300 C II whatever
the hell that is
so no in fact it is not special hardware
but this isn't a surprise to me and it
shouldn't be a surprise to you now
shockingly I actually can't find any
tear downs of red mini mags online that
weren't done in the last few days since
this story broke but I've known about
this for years and I've even complained
publicly that red is selling regular old
M SATA SSDs add obscene markups they're
not even PCI Express M SATA SSDs in a
fancy red enclosure oh and you don't
even get red it's like it's a black
enclosure if you don't buy the 480 or
the 960 gig it just took until now to
blow up why well it seems to come from
this video from Ginni tech a small-time
maker of knockoff mags and that's
actually the biggest reason that I had
intended to ignore this whole thing I
have no desire to draw attention to them
especially because given what I know
about social media marketing it wouldn't
surprise me if some of the outrage over
this is actually BOTS
created by Ginny tech themselves but
whether that's the case or not here we
are so let's take a quick look at both
the valid points and the misleading
arguments that they make in their video
that they position as an expose but that
is ultimately designed to put pressure
on red
and then ultimately sell you their
product so right out of the gate they
present forum posts from red users about
failed Meg's as evidence that Jared
lands reliability justification for the
cost of a red meg is bullspit now the
problem with that is that without
knowing the sample size a dozen or even
a hundred failures is not necessarily an
indication that there is a significant
problem with product quality or
validation the second problem is the way
that Ginni tech repeatedly attacks red
for their made-in-the-usa claims the way
that a transformation is defined is not
entirely cut and dried red could make
arguments that some aspects of their red
assembly and manufacture process are
deeper than just screwdriver assembly
and in fact Ginni Meg admitted in a
court filing that their own made in the
UK Meg's are sourced from other
countries in exactly the same way now as
for the 480 and 960 versus 512 gig and 1
terabyte advertised capacity scandal red
really should have communicated this
better but they also haven't said
anything outright false here the raw
capacity of any 480 gigabyte SSD is 512
gigabytes that's just the way that NAND
flash manufacturing works and it's up to
the integrator in this case virgin to
determine how much of that 512 gigs or 1
terabyte as it were to allocate to spare
area spare area improves both
performance and longevity now red never
should have advertised them as 512 gigs
if all 512 gigs weren't accessible but
they weren't technically wrong because
physically there is 512 gigs of flash on
the drive now as for the claim about the
quality of the non commodity media that
red uses so mine is a virgin store fly
with some Toshiba nan chips on it and
it's fine but it's a low cost model and
neither the NAND flash nor the
controller is anything more than
commodity grade now of course a big part
of Reds story is the firmware so then is
that special this is where things get a
bit nuanced Jenny Tech is 100% correct
in asserting that the commodity SSDs
that Reds using contain standard
firmware but he doesn't say that they
don't also contain extra bits one thing
he doesn't show in his video is that
while the camera does recognize any
random and SATA SSD in a Meg enclosure
popped into the side of it it actually
will not write to it at full speed
unless the user takes extra steps to
fool the camera into thinking that it is
in fact a genuine Meg so the main
problem that we run into here is Jenny
tax use of real information that Reds
hardware and firmware are not in fact
special to draw a misleading conclusion
no evidence is actually given to
demonstrate that these low-cost consumer
grade SSDs crippled the cameras
functionality and the faking of
customized firmware is really no
different from the way that an Nvidia
board partner fakes the model number of
their reference board to include their
vendor information because here's the
thing once the product ships in a
gigabyte or an EVGA box and is covered
by that vendors warranty rather than the
warranty of whatever factory built the
launch boards for NVIDIA it is in fact a
gigabyte or an EVGA or an asus product
even if the different model number
basically amounted to altering a couple
of strings in the firmware so that it's
detected by the software correctly a
read Meg becomes a read product not a
Verdean or micron product as soon as red
ships it to you with their support
attached to it no foul play at least
that would be the case if red hadn't
been so disingenuous about the way that
they've marketed these things over the
years now I've been fairly focused on
the way that Ginnie tech has misled the
a community and massage their message up
till this point but red is far from
blameless here let's change gears now as
a techie I'm not too offended by some of
Reds claims for example that a physical
adapter couldn't have been created
between the original red Meg and the
current mini Meg it could have been done
quite easily given that both of them are
just M SATA SSDs in a fancy machined box
but the thing is adapters do add more
points of failure and I wouldn't
necessarily want to support that either
so whatever the one thing that really
annoys me is Reds claim that they spend
millions of dollars on R&amp;amp;D around their
media recording now if red is talking
about red Co draw their proprietary
compressed raw file format sure I'll buy
that kind of Awesome but jinny tech
makes a very fair point in their video
pointing out that the customer already
paid for red raw when they bought the
camera the red mini mag uses nothing but
a standard SATA interface and red would
be crazy to use anything other than SATA
because SATA which has had millions of
dollars spent on its development just
not by red is so well supported across
multiple platforms including the cameras
that record to them and the PCs and Macs
that need to read from them during
footage ingest the other really
offensive thing that Jarrod hasn't been
entirely forthright about is exactly
what aspect of Red's firmware
development has been infringed by jinny
Tech in spite of all the evidence to the
contrary he still seems to be at least
suggesting that it is some kind of
proprietary SSD firmware algorithm but
it seems far more likely to me that it's
simply a DRM scheme now to be clear from
a legal standpoint that makes him right
his product has been infringed just not
in a way that makes me feel bad for him
at all calling the way that the Meg
written to Red's own is misleading at
best let's break down how it works this
is a really nice video from Jersey
filmmaker covering the unusual way that
red writes video files to a mag
basically every time you press the
record button you create a folder
instead of a single large clip and that
folder is gonna be full of as many four
gig files as it takes to record the
footage until you press stop your
editing software then automatically
stitches these many clips together now
if you've been around the block as many
times as I have you'll know that this is
nothing but a simple workaround for the
four gig file size limit of the fat32
file system fat32 is desirable for its
simplicity it's high throughput and of
course it's cross-platform compatibility
but it's the furthest possible thing
from Red's own and Red's own way of
doing things has other archaic
workarounds too instead of allowing an
individual clip to be deleted from the
mag after a bad take for example red
requires that the entire mag be
formatted before use now their claim is
that this is to protect the user from
accidental deletions but as far as I can
tell it's just to compensate for their
basic ass SSDs here's a thing a full
format with secure erase reduces the
write speed penalty that comes with
overwriting previously used flash cells
so it's pretty much a cost-saving
measure which is kind of sad when you
consider how widely available better
SSDs that would not require this
limitation are these days so yeah
repackaging commodity products and
marking them up ten times upsets me but
ultimately as a customer nobody is
forcing me to buy this it's not like I
don't know the price ahead of time so I
don't have a ton of ground to stand on
know the thing that has always really
pissed me off is their nonsense about
how much they manage to spend on R&amp;amp;D
without coming to the same basic
conclusion that the entire storage
industry came two decades ago
nothing is perfect not your consumer
thing not your server great thing
nothing is perfect and for anything to
be truly professional-grade
it must have redundancy now red admits
outright that they spend a lot of time
performing data recovery services on
their customers media so to me then that
would indicate that they are well aware
that their media does in fact fail I do
applaud their efforts to help their
customers recover their data not
everybody does this but the issue for me
is that data recovery is an
ass-backwards solution and when I read a
statement like that from a company CEO I
can't help but think that red has
weighed the cost of data recovery
against the cost of actually engineering
a more robust solution and decided you
know what it's just not worth it to
create something better they've
determined that putting your footage at
risk is worth it compared to the cost of
engineering a raid one mag solution that
would only increase their cost per mag
by about double which we can see that
they could easily absorb while almost
never requiring data recovery which guys
even if you do get the footage back
causes stress and lost productivity that
their customers will never get back
anyway nothing here was a revelation to
me and I find both Gini Tech's
motivation here and the way that this
has suddenly blown up highly
questionable but rayet has never put me
in a position to feel bad for them so
from my perspective guys you are reaping
what you've sown these are the dangers
of magic black box marketing once the
illusion fails people feel justifiably
betrayed and pissed off so I would
recommend being honest in the first
place next time usually the engineering
is cooler than the magic story anyway
and if it's not engineer it better next
time
like with real-time redundancy for my
footage thanks and thanks to our sponsor
