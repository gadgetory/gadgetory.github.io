live with we're late but yeah over eight
minutes yeah they're not it's not yeah
for us that's really not bad like eight
minutes is pretty damn bad but like yeah
for our track record I feel like that's
not the worst thing
it's like going one mile over the speed
limit like who cares yeah compared to
last week where we went fifty over the
speed limit had a car impounded because
we were like we were so late that people
got the timezone wrong and thought that
we were a little bit early because we
were like fifty eight minutes late so
people thought we might have been two
minutes early how does that even happen
this is just when fanzones start coming
into play yeah so good anyway this week
we have lots of topics most of which are
AMD based there is so much AMD news
which is great because their stock needs
to come up so hopefully that goes well
but we'll get into that in a moment
other Matt we also have a two hundred
Hertz ultrawide monitor and North Korea
has started manufacturing their own iPad
who does that look like I find out and
we're going to start the intro using the
stream deck
so hopefully this works I just tried it
like a million times and it did so we'll
see that was awkward
Oh No but it's fancy but here it work
why ran like worked before
it works fine like little literally does
go when we went live it works completely
okay tearing it broke well I don't know
what to tell you hang on see how you
tear it everybody hi trying to get this
close here we give us a second present
thing you know oh god it's gone so this
this is the stream deck as you guys
wrote you'd read a really a scary fans
yeah what did that do it well we can't
see now could know well just click on OK
it works when we weren't live I'm just
gonna ha ha ha oh good gracious I kind
of sum things up right now that's like
I know excellent integration right now
that's the issue they have over yet but
they don't have explains what though I
told them that that's important and like
it is so clearly windows anything other
than 1000 or xsplit screw it anyways I
fix it you can screw things with their
screwdrivers that would be fantastic
thank you I fix it
also LTX Tech Carnival 2017 if you want
to go to that get some tickets meet me
there and Squarespace thanks very much
to Squarespace I'm going to show this
back to the top and then I'm going to
try to use the stream deck nope going to
click on it that works better sometimes
an easier solution is better not always
well I find I feel bad because I was
kind of attacking Elgato on Twitter
because their stream deck only works
with Windows 10 and I don't like Windows
10 but I like the stream deck and like I
have one now because cat boiler bought
one for me which was like amazing well
but I can't use exciting news Windows 10
are you currently using the version of
Windows that has the current lease
market penetration except for maybe
Vista probably close to that but like
supporting the last two is a fairly
general I think that's fair but okay
anyway I still think it's a super cool
product it is for a pretty nice crowd
but still a super cool product so I'm
actually not trying to roast them by
having it not work right now there's
something going wrong because it was
totally working flawlessly when we were
offline and I will completely admit to
that so that's how it always happens it
worked perfectly window was looking
Taryn is the one that's trying to do the
review on this thing so if you guys are
interested in the stream deck and have
any specific questions about or anything
like that hit tearin up on twitter i
don't you notice handle is no handles
off it at Karen's VH that yeah that
sounds right
so Tay at ter and VH on Twitter if you
have any specific questions about the
stream deck he will let those see if
they're important enough and maybe
include them in his review but to start
the show we've got AMD news not stream
deck news the first of the main AMD news
topics is AMD announces new thread
Ripper details and these are pretty
freakin juicy I start firing through
them I'll get this on screen yeah so
thread Ripper is confirmed to be half of
an epic processor that's EP YC and I had
when I first read this I had to slide a
Gary Johnson moment where I didn't I
thought it was an acronym but it's not
it's just epic spelled with the Y
because it supposed to be they're super
high-end things so I'm looking at 16
cores and 32 threads on the top end made
of two processor dies so that's pretty
interesting
all products feature 64 lanes of PCI
Express with sixty of those coming off
of the chipset for reference of the top
end of the new Intel i9s on the other
side or 44 so you're getting quite a bit
more with this all products featuring
ddr4 quality on the RAM pretty standard
16 Meg's of level 3 cache and x3 99
chipset and which is so annoying because
I saw this I had yet another moment like
that where I saw x3 99 I'm just like is
Intel releasing like to families of
chipsets back-to-back because of two 9i
but they're not this isn't this is an
AMD thing like so oh yeah I wonder if
they're just trying to zetz Intel with a
naming a little bit there ours is one
hundred better and yeah and like and
you're not going to want to name your
next platform this one because we
already had it and both yeah exactly the
naming schemes for the last like few
years just I can't even go over it and I
know you guys probably even like tired
of hearing it at this point because I
feel like every single video that a
product has a stupid name like the like
the surface pro instead of being the
surface pro 5 or the almost any razor
laptop at this point like it's just it's
so frustrating that all the reviewers
freaked out about it I don't know how
interesting it is for the viewers but
like uh just I don't know and subtly I'm
expecting someone get sick of it like a
new company sort MOT model name company
name or company product name line number
one hoorah - yeah exactly yeah perfect
q1 product one done why not we've made
500 products what is this product name
500 it's like Intel's first-ever process
was what was what the 4004 what happened
to one through
4003 like like I know there was a reason
behind it but still you know anyway but
okay so there's a new there's a rumor
about the thread Ripper and that rumor
is that the thread Ripper might be under
$1000 which due to the you know more
recent news from the Intel camp is a
little bit cheaper the sixteen core
version of the coin I nine which is I
the top at the top end is 18 cores and
cost two grand yeah the sixteen core I
don't know the pricing on top of my head
but you have to think it's at least a
$1500 part you know so this is going to
this is going to be quite the cheaper
yeah and like this isn't this is a like
a random tweet leak kind of deal thing
if it even is a leak this is a little
loose but yeah I don't know 849 is
insanely cheap for what you're getting
and the thing is that that sounds like a
movie em do you would try to pull so I'm
not even like wait it doesn't seem
unrealistic this seems like something
they would do I mean there's also the
whole IPC argument and what
single-threaded like yeah there's more
to it for sure but you know at the same
time Rison has been mostly good as far
as single-threaded so far yeah you have
to think okay then then we've got if I'm
just going to try to power through some
AMD news here hopefully everyone wants
to hear about AMD stuff I do it's kind
of what's interesting right now so AMD
trims prices of the rise in seven
seventeen hundred and the rise in 1,700
X so I saw that you guys on extreme the
current price of the 1700 is three
hundred and $19 that's going down by ten
or sorry the current price is 329 it's
going down by 10 to 319 or a major
difference but the three 1700 X which
was 399 is going down by 50 bucks to 349
and the 1800 X has a little bit of a
smaller change it's going from 499 to
469 with the savings of $30 that that's
1,700 x discount is pretty sick actually
it's pretty substantial it's just like
booking a hotel at Disney World the more
expensive thing gets the bigger discount
goes on sale and it's kinda what's
happening here well not entirely not
entirely but it's the most expensive not
gonna you're not going you're not going
to say this much on the very low end oh
yeah that's you know that I think you
know the $50 you know get yourself get
yourselves a triple a toggle get
yourself a few toll fax amount and do
get your so whatever rolls you're in the
yeah fill the mini-fridge there you go
but yeah I know I think that's pretty
cool I've been struggling on my
nightstand with a mini-fridge I'm
thirsty Nolan I just reach over my
fridge is all the way downstairs now
like get some nuka-cola yeah perfect uh
yeah but like I I think that's pretty
substantial 400 to 350 there's that like
golden number that's like a round it was
300 for a long time but then I think
there's been some inflation and now it
might be like 350 right but for a long
time like consoles we're right around
300 like a lot of like nicer things that
you could get for like your house like
different tabletop things whatnot tried
to aim at like 300 because it was a
digestible but relatively expensive item
that you could buy but like a digestible
like you could save up for this over a
little bit and get it and would probably
be fine yes is that that's the trick in
this industry right you'll the price
things high but not too high and there's
always a spot to hit there so I think
that might help them actually getting to
that 350 number that's pretty cool and
on top of that AMD Vega release dates
this is cool the Vega frontier Edition
card will be available on June 27 can we
bring up a picture of that because it
looks pretty Evo hopefully they've got
it in here because it yeah that's pretty
cool did I like it you might not be able
to tell from the screen cap there but
that little yellow thing of the upper
right is it's actually a good secure it
lights up it illuminated the are of
course for Radeon so and it also comes
in a kind of a reverse color scheme I
think they have a gold one with like a
blue cube on it is so super clickbait
stuff come on and antic I've always
hated like not to rag on an antique over
here but I've always hated when there's
article clickbait ads on a site that is
based around articles because it makes
you think that like reverse hair loss of
this brilliantly simple home remedy
Anandtech is now talking about like
this secret that will cure your diabetes
and this ear tinnitus ending trick thing
and like weird other stuff hashtag fake
news except it literally is yeah but
yeah yeah but yeah that's a pretty sick
looking card I'm also stoked that it's
coming soon because I feel like Vega has
been this like cherry that's been
dangled in front of everyone for so
freakin long and it's been actually
really annoying because people have been
asking me forever on my stream on this
stream on all the comments on all the
videos on the forums everywhere like oh
should I buy this card or should I wait
for Vega it's been like I have no idea
yes I don't know in Vegas coming
information has been a little bit hard
to come by I actually wonder if they're
going to have that sick looking shroud
for the consumer line because the
frontier Edition is it's more of a
professionals card you know so it's not
really for gaming yeah yeah sounds like
the founders efficient there there's a
lot of originality going on over there X
399 the founders Edition now they need
to combine the two the X 399 founders
Edition old because or sorry frontier
runs here at this run to your Edition
I'll get it right so about that frontier
edition come on guys
anyways that's absolutely super cool I'm
really stoked on that release date and
I'm assuming that because like as far as
I know we don't have one yet
so I'm assuming that means that we're
getting one fairly soon we'll be able to
like screw around with it it will be
cool um I look forward to it
yeah the the frontier edition of ambe's
4 is Andy's first batch of Vega base
cards marketed towards early adopters
completely unlike the founders Edition
yeah okay a price has not been announced
that sort of sucks it's called an Emmy
if it's a pro-level card it's gonna be
it's gonna be like Quatro level probably
so it's gonna be pretty high it will be
many dollars and it's not going to be
cheap some intel news finally until
getting on the board so much AMD news
Intel announces skylake X bringing 18
core HTC silicon to consumers
for $2,000 they've also simultaneously
announced KB like X which is very
confusing yes so so sky like X is like
the super high end and then KB like X at
least for now is going to be I think
mainly for core a thread I sevens right
which one going through puberty there
apparently yeah but uh Wow so we're not
used to seeing for core eight thread
skews being considered an enthusiast
product but apparently now at least some
of them are so that's happening as well
yeah I very exceeding of confusing
naming schemes but yeah top end i9 18
cores 36 threads $2,000
it's cool but then I think there's gonna
be an interest interesting fight and I
think at least as far as our viewers are
concerned
AMD's probably going to win this fight
because just the value proposition of
those dollar amounts is pretty intense I
feel bad for anyone who bought a 69 50 X
with the fourth is puny 10 cores they're
selling okay they're selling a 10 core I
9 as the lowest end I 9 they have score
excuse going from 10 to 18 cores so if
you spent that much money on a 69 50 X I
feel bad for you son okay I got 18
problems I guess I got yeah but only
having 10 isn't one of them I failed
that pretty hard let's revisit this
collection I feel like this wouldn't
worth like processing of the background
for yeah okay cool speaking about
processing in the background possibly
not happening anymore
Elon Musk to Trump you quit Paris so I
quit you this is some political jargon
so we're probably not going to spend too
much time on this but Elon Musk and
Disney boss didn't know about that part
quit Trump's business panel over the
Paris pull out basically what happened
there's this thing called a Paris Accord
who was agreed to last year it was a ton
of countries came together saying hey
let's do something about global warming
then Trump got elected
and he said nah ain't about that he's
going to try to pull us out of it and
Elom us was not very happy about it so
Elan is no longer sitting on I think a
president Trump had electrode technology
count full Advisory Group thing
Elan ought to happy with the Paris
decision so he's pulling out and that's
pretty much that
yeah so II Lars tweets said and
departing presidential councils climate
change is real leaving Paris is not good
for America or the world and there you
go although encounter news because I'm
trying to explain the whole playing
field I believe there was like a surge
in the stock market or something I have
a lot market did well or something if
you're interested in that go check it
out somewhere else we're not very good
at covering political topics it's not
our mo correlation is not causation or
is it decide for yourself also I should
be noted however you feel about this
issue the Paris Accord actually up to my
knowledge it doesn't mandate that the
signatories actually do anything so it's
not like oh you must reduce carbon
emissions by X percentage by year why or
there will be consequences it I don't
think it does anything like that but
there whichever way you feel about this
there you go so this is another like a
kind of political topic kind of deal
where we're probably not going to dive
into it too far but you guys might be
interested so we're at least going to
give you like the kernel so that if you
are interested in it you can go try to
find the whole popped corn I don't know
where I was going with that but it does
a whole piece of popcorn yeah there is
well one is a precursor the others yeah
I guess I guess how it works yeah yeah
so this is a US approved social media
background checks for visa applicants
the so the reason why we thought this
might be interesting to you guys is
social media
I guess tech thing social media stuff I
don't know you know yours is definitely
tech is it I mean like it's social media
sure but I mean how I get like do you
call someone who's on Twitter a lot of
techie go on our forums go on Ars
Technica go on any of the major sites
that cover techmuze there's all ma
covers out either of privacy or net
neutrality just affect social media and
it's discussed as a
topic so I think completely appropriate
yeah I've always just thought it's been
a little weird but I do agree with
saying it at all there's a questionnaire
which we can check out here in a second
because it was laced by the glorious
person who made this dock so here we go
here's the Wow okay yeah we're not going
to look that closely at that social
media identify our name slash handle
social media platform so you can see
that right there so I guess you'd have
to declare I wonder how like what is
defined by social media please provide
your unique username for any websites or
applications you have used to create or
share content photos videos status
updates etc as part of a public profile
within the last five years so like what
qualifies if someone is not from the
States and they use Linus tech tips com
I think they would have to declare their
username and the site let's just get
right down to brass tacks well if you
have a pornhub account you're leaving
comments on that does that mean
seriously those does no but like I think
like would if you want to embarrass
yourself to that like point like because
that is in a four it says latest updates
which is just text and then etc there is
also the thing where I'll I also wonder
how they would find out like let's say
you just put you let's just let's say
you just put Twitter all I use this
Twitter I have a public Twitter handle
you put that down you declare it so if
you had five other things would they
necessarily know where maybe they're
going to like cross search your handle
they could potentially badass expose you
to and find you on pornhub as well I
don't know if you're maybe for a unknown
person of interest to customs and border
protection and you only declare one hand
would be like oh yeah we need to like a
look at this guy so I use like veil of
secrecy around it you know because you
don't know exactly what is really big
yeah and it's really vague to the point
where like I feel like if you signed up
for some random site four point four or
five years ago and completely forgot
about how do people have yeah accounts
all this around the internet they forgot
about it because they don't need Oh
want to access an article when it has to
sign it first took a free account and
everyone use begin but it does say
though that this isn't like an auto
request it says additional information
would only be requested when the
department determines that : quote such
information is required to confirm
identity or conduct more rigorous
national security vetting so this sounds
like they're going to ask you if you're
already like flagged if you're already
some kind of person of interest to them
it also says if you're unsure of the
answer to a question please provide a
response to the best of your knowledge
mm-hmm so don't feel like you're going
to get crushed to the vast majority of
dealings with the federal government is
you're not going to get in ridiculous
trouble as long as you're trying until
the truth like that's kind of how the
IRS operates you know they they don't
they don't typically come after people
for all these mistakes they really go
ask you if you're if they think you're
like intentionally like lying or
defrauding them so don't forget line is
tech tips calm if you're trying to get a
visa in the US make sure you list that
as a social media platform I want as
many US officials searching my site for
people's user names as possible just
because it sounds fun okay so if we get
guys in like dark dark suits showing up
yeah one day at the door at sunglasses
awesome yeah yeah super cool I'm excited
what was the chat saying about this I
kind of want to know I have no idea
probably nothing good will do yes thank
you very much Roy I appreciate I
appreciate your your willingness to do
so yeah I believe Tom a US citizen yeah
feel the same way haha I wouldn't I was
actually crying the board the RNA I was
driving down to Bellingham and I got a
pretty gross gruff border officer I gave
my passport he saw it was from the US
his whole tone completely changed Oh
welcome back I'm sorry I was just sort
of becoming super chill with me because
because I have BC license plates are
thought I was Canadian but you all
doesn't you just it was so funny but so
another person come over border pick up
a darn package so many of us
Oh Lord okay my favorite question is
what do you can be over for I'm just
picking up a package uh sir it's it's
3:00 a.m. why are you picking up a
package I don't sleep man
well yeah you know what I would say if I
were you and this would also not be
lying um is that the border whites are
much less yeah there's a few I've had to
get into it a little bit more a couple
times but that's that's a big one
there's I can just roll up and there's
usually only nobody or one or two people
in front of me which Greater Vancouver
has two major highway border crossings
and they're both usually extremely busy
so yeah like quite a while yeah next up
is North Korea's iPad Oh religious io AI
air quotes iPad yeah yeah so a North
Korean company come named Wow Jung Yeo
Kyung sure mule Kyung IT released a new
tablet they called it the iPad so that
is not yeah okay good it's it says in
the corner of this photo actual iPad
designed by Apple in California
I like how designed by Apple and Cal
made it all the way to that subjects
doing this okay I okay I think the
reason why I made it there was because
he's trying to be like making a joke
like no I'm not around obviously a joke
like it's not made by Kim Jong hoon and
Pyongyang so yeah yeah yeah Apple hasn't
commented on this development its use of
its most popular trademarks and while
the company undoubtedly isn't pleased
with it it's unclear what kind of legal
action it could take against a company
that's controlled by the North Korean
government I guarantee you they don't
care their lawyers don't care I don't
think there's really any significant
market in North Korea for Western
consumer goods at the same time you know
there is a market in ER yeah there's not
going to be more that this is going to
be shipped out of North Korea it's
probably going to be one of those deals
like with their radios and TVs over
there
oh it's set to like three channels the
only broadcast government approved like
content and propaganda this is probably
going to be the same thing where they
have it running through like a firewall
just for North Korea
yeah so apples not going to care it
doesn't matter so it could this is
fantastic it is a 1 gigahertz CPU 512
megabytes of RAM 8 gigs of internal
storage 16 gigs of external storage an 8
inch display and it promises six hours
of battery life honestly that is not
quite as bad as I expected the next part
though is rather fantastic it's
currently unknown what kind of apps the
device will be able to run in a region
like North Korea which is not surprising
but it has a total of 28 websites that
it can access that's a pretty good
number of whoops is probably eight
gigabytes is also that's a lot of
compressed JPEG I think - your phone's
more than 28 domains just because he
like likes buying domains yeah so how
many images of the dear leader is that 8
gigabytes and how about how much how
much would like you know there has to be
a minimum quota like you have to have a
certain percentage of your storage on
your tablet filled with various angles
and various images of the leader yes
like and like the guy at home the the
the game is probably something like it's
like space invaders except it's it's
like you know Kim jong-eun you're like a
little fight or fighting the capitalist
or something yeah it's like something
like that
so using American flags in an asteroid
simulator bastard yeah but so so yeah
that's happening oh that's pretty epic
can Apple even do anything to stop this
I seriously doubt it unless Apple
decides get an army which at this point
they could probably do they probably
could but I mean I mean again like if if
you're going to say okay would this
violate some sort of like intellectual
property statue with or not at you but
agreement that North Korea is probably
not even a signatory to they still have
to enforce their laws inside their own
borders it's kinda you know Team America
World Police where Hans Blix comes in
yeah or what or will write you a letter
saying how angry we are with you so yeah
probably nothing is going to happen and
some folks in North Korea will be
getting their on commie Tad's so yeah
there you have it after that we've got a
soos with an announcement of a 35 inch
rog swift PG 35 VQ display with quantum
dots and a2
it hurts refresh rate my question is I'm
actually getting a little bit disturbed
by this Asus where the heck is the 4k
HDR g-sync beautiful Swift that they
announced at CES that I saw in person
working you know I can't I buy one I you
know II to them and they just liked it
they didn't say anything oh the long
troll okay well you you know better than
to see a prototype at a trade show and
then be like over here my buyers are
heard it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter it doesn't matter maybe only work
for the length of the show and it like
dyed paella you don't know that so funny
funny story about seeing the prototype
thing in 2012
we're just before Christmas in 2012 I
decided that I was good this was
remember 2012 this is early Kickstarter
this is when people still like
believably or but things might happen
I saw a hammer on there it was super
cool it's called the kolbar hammer
lastly if I can find this it just hold
great sword the Cole bar here it is hold
our hammer by Lance Brown oh my goodness
see was I right was as well oh this
thing does look pretty cool on the yeah
hit update
so yeah expected delivery of June 2013
and my gift to him was the backing of
the project the project launched April
25th 2013 okay so it was a 2013 but it's
been a long time but it's been a while
yeah so I backed the Cole bar hammer I
decided to back this thing for my dad
it's super cool in theory it usually I'm
not into like multi-tool stuff but this
one actually looks pretty sweet you can
see like a lot of people covered it you
can turn it into a crowbar
instead of just being a hammer it's it's
a socket wrench like it's a whole bunch
of different things and it's it's their
destruction tool so you can take them
apart completely it's amazing like it's
pretty cool right
it's still not out but the best part
about this because most Kickstarter
projects if it's been like four years
they would have just given up right
kolbar has not given up at this point if
you go to their updates task which I
check every once in a blue moon just out
of interest fifth month 10-day
seventeenth year they're still giving
updates for backers only so I can't seek
some not logged in but dang it's
basically a modular or hammer why is it
taking so long like this does it have a
you tooth or something like what what
like why is it and yeah that's the other
part okay so the whole reason why I got
to this story is in their demonstration
videos they have one and they like the
guy like jams it in a little thing and
hangs off of it and like they they do
tons of tests with it so I'm like okay
you know what I'll back this because
they physically have the product and I
can clearly see that it is working maybe
it was a very very very well done
hologram ah man this point I have to
wonder if it's been for years and I
think crushed my soul that destroyed any
possibility of me being into Kickstarter
what is that like fueled the Kickstarter
kick-started series well it's funny
because it's a literal hammer so it's
smashed
there's men it's smashing yeah and
Kickstarter there you go
just buy a hammer and a multi-tool I
know I was trying to like my dad is
totally of the persuasion and I agree
with this to be completely honest of
just buy the damn tool use it till it
breaks them and buy another one I'm like
tossing around do whatever the job is
what's important but try to not buy one
that's like - crap but like he's not
super into like oh this is such an
amazing tool he just like wants
something that he can do the job with
yeah like so I was going to try to buy
him something that was above the tear
that he normally shops that but not like
so he doesn't have to be the one that
buys it so he doesn't feel bad about
spending too much money on something
mm-hmm but it's also not like God Tyr
yeah it's just kind of a cool nifty
thing and then nope never got it
completely failed so when a chat said I
hate sand yeah it's coarse and you guess
everywhere just what's funny every topic
in it it absolutely is speaking of funny
every time every single time it's funny
we're going to go to look
at channel super-fun on a float plane so
here we go this is the float plane club
where's channel super fun meanest
YouTube comments this was actually
genuinely hilarious that's a great time
with this one so everyone that you can
seem a thumbnail right now including the
the one and only Nikki V and John who
cigarettes I mean why we happen comments
but you're here everyday living at O
platform yeah Maron a not be you know
like an opera video but Colton could
have picked far meaner things there's a
pretty intense to have some of the more
heavily old Dennis had some pretty
brutal ones this one on screen how to be
Dennis be terrible at everything sheet
and then lie about cheating that
honestly sounds a little bit more like
Linus with like like those like the
perpetual if you watch kenny vs spenny
linus on channel super fun is kenny i
can't remember a channel super fun where
he did not cheat in some way or attempt
cheat yeah I think the last would the
backyard Wars am i right yeah look the
batting cages wasn't a competition
because we were just literally hitting
balls but other than that yeah every
time so you can see it scrubs pretty
quick which is cool applause watch this
video now if you're interested which is
cool and you can even download it to
watch it later you can which is
awesomely fantastic scrapyard Wars if
you guys have been enjoying that the
last episode of scrapyard Wars will be
on floatplane this weekend they've been
on full plane every Saturday so far but
the main editor for them EADS ill got
pretty freaking sick actually so the
next one is going to be slightly delayed
it will be coming out on Sunday instead
of on Saturday but it is still coming on
floatplane first so you can see the
actually insane probably the most insane
conclusion of any scrap edward's we've
had the last season of sky viewer season
4 was my favorite one but in terms of
conclusions
this last conclusion is insane and by
far the most nutty freaking balls
conclusion we've ever had like no
question about it at all now you don't
know do you
I've only watched through the first
episodes I have not had time to what
yeah I fully intend to watch the rest of
them I'm not saying that but everyone
that was a part of it has been trying to
stay
rather close lipped about it around the
office because a lot of people around me
out if I don't have any much going on
this weekend a bunch of sit down like
binge like the last couple of them yeah
so yeah I think this week not not to
bash on my own platform but I think this
week a fair amount of the things that
were released were from copy text so
they're on both platforms but we do have
a few different things that that meanest
YouTube comments on channel Superfund is
genuinely hilarious like highly
recommend that there's some tech wiki
stuff on here why do people still use
fax machines if you guys like the sketch
that we did for our scanners fast as
possible
uh you're going to love this one um so
Reese why do people still still use fax
machines featuring the one the only
dentist's Leal currently on floatplane
Club just went up today okay yeah hey
there he is coming out of a phone I love
it have you ever happens for you a
little bit you're sitting there minding
your own business nope
what you're making noise oh my god bomb
so you call your friends anyways that's
your teaser and there's another episode
about about SEO I believe what yeah
isn't it exciting but it's still very
interesting a cool a cool topic so tech
work is interesting because it doesn't
have like there's like sex appeal of
certain channels but it's more
interesting than a lot of other things
woo cos basically summed up my entire
life hahaha I smell is China's bitch
well you said uh anyways if you need a
website for whatever reason you can go
to Squarespace and get your website on
Squarespace you can save 10% by using
offer code when they've 24/7 live chat
an email support it is twelve bucks a
month and if you subscribe for a year
you get a domain rolled in with that
they have a commerce module so you can
sell your stuff online they have a cover
page feature so you can have one nice
beautiful scrollable page and everyone
can now publish content in the Apple
news format directly from there
Squarespace blog module which is pretty
cool
it's automatically available to millions
of potential viewers this thing
dynamically changes
a responsive way to basically whatever
screen size in whatever format you need
it's all done for you it's fantastic
about commerce already yes if you're
using Squarespace and you want to host
an online store this is new this is
pretty recent update to the platform
they they they now support lots of
different new currencies so if you love
cool greatly shekels if you want to take
pesos from Mexico if you wanna take New
Zealand dollars Singapore dollars even
rubles from our good friends over in
Russia you can do that now that's really
cool actually
so it's great dark rum slash win offer
code win 10% off moving on if you need
to fix some stuff I actually use this
thing very often at home now that I have
one at home but I fix this Pro Tech tool
kit you've probably seen them in a lot
of our content we use them in scrap yard
Wars yeah 64 bit driver kit magnets
which is actually really nice the the
lid for the driver kit magnetically goes
on and when you take it off you can use
it as a parts tray which is pretty sick
it has precision ESD safe tweezers
including a pair of reverse tweezers it
has a rather wide variety of plastic
opening tools that are better quality
let me see if I have four here yes these
things are beautiful some of the the
older ones that they had were still
really cool and I like them a lot but
they weren't as durable as these ones
are doc do you use them a few times the
edge would get a little chewed up and
then you might have some issues getting
through some thinner electronics but
these new ones have been able to
withstand like everything we've thrown
at them which has actually been really
cool they give you three which is pretty
awesome so even if you do manage to wear
through a few of them they've really
been a lifesaver because the current
trend in electronics best desktops but
on laptops tablets mobile phones has
been let's make this thing as difficult
to user service as possible yeah opening
tools really help so those are like
manual intervention openers basically
it's backed by I fix its lifetime
warranty which is awesome buy it because
it's awesome or don't and you still get
access to all of their free repair
resources which is awesome so
even if you have your own driver kit and
your own tools if you want to get into
repairing stuff and you don't want to
buy this you can still go to I fix its
website and learn how to take things
apart which is awesome they use their
own toolkits on there so it's easier if
you have their toolkit but yeah I don't
want to line it up sorry head over to
ifixit.com slash line is to use offer
code line is to the checkout to say five
bucks on a purchase of ten bucks or more
there you go and if you're in Canada
this is actually a pretty cool note if
you're in Canada checkout amazon.ca for
cheaper shipping options because
sometimes we have sponsors and we talk
about buying it whatever in people in
Canada where we're from are like goes
you're from our own region and shipping
sucks for this so they're offering
another option which is pretty cool also
LTX if you want to show up to a weird
place and meet us weird people and do
weird things you can go you can buy
tickets for LTX I'm going to move to
that thing there we go
so you can go to the worst URL to say
out loud ever which is ticket rocket
docto slash event flash details slash
nine seven two four six /lp x - 2017
come meet me we can talk about burger
trivia oh my god you should have a
trivia booth we'll figure something out
that would absolutely be awesome I'm
doing VR stuff mm-hmm
turns editing a video you can do the
like what is that geoguessr yeah no
promises but it's a fantastic idea I'm
going to look into actually like that a
lot that would be freaking great and
back to the real show okay what is there
even a talk about still this week was
weird
most of the like interesting news from
this week is in literal videos that line
is hosted from confit eggs but Microsoft
has rolled out not one but two bad
builds on the windows insider program
thanks guys it's like every so often
they're a lot they remember oh we're
that company that may windows me we
should provide all that from time to
time many of you things like this
windows me I don't know Legum Edition no
I know I just don't hear it called that
very
but yeah that's kind of helping marketed
it like me oh it's my version of Windows
for regular people in the year 2000
except it wasn't it just made everyone's
very very mad it's a fork
yeah the marketing was terrible but
Windows 7 Professional update so yeah I
like I don't know
huh and now people the chat or saying or
appear to think that I said Windows mean
ME ME oh my kind of was is the one needs
you to make a custom Microsoft OS that
is skinned all with memes it's like
every day when you log on there's like a
different courage wolf as your
background he's saying different things
Cortana is advice dog is it just advice
dog yeah yeah it shouldn't be pin a
while since that mean was popular but
it's like yeah you could even do like a
two-in-one with that you can have it be
advice on but it could start every sense
to you with yo dog like the exhibit mean
there you go yes whenever your system
has like a pretty heavy slow down and
then comes up with like an error they
can be slowpoke that'd be good I please
someone do this that would be fantastic
your you know what you're like you're
you're you're developing an idea for
another line of tech this video as we
speak the custom mean Windows meme yeah
there you go
oh geez John's pics what is this this is
just crap I said to James okay what is
this tell the people tell the people
okay um well first thing I will do is I
did find us earlier and it read it but
I've been busy since then so let me
click on the article first and write to
see Coralie about engineering is subject
of First Amendment lawsuit an engineer
was fined $500 for discussing traffic
light engineering without a license so
would this happened down in Oregon which
is not too far from here uh so I heard
of apparently this guy sent the state
some advice about traffic light timings
specifically he wanted to make yellows
longer um which is odd which obviously
can be very important for traffic flow
reasons and also not to surprise people
when they think they have enough time to
drive through an intersection but they
actually don't
anyway so um but instead of the state
saying hey thank you for speaking out
concerned citizen let's have a look at
this they instead slap them with the
five hundred dollar fine for doing
something along the lines of practicing
engineering without a license now as
some as you know I went to law school I
have a law license which is currently
inactive because why do I need it right
now but I do have one from North
Carolina and it there and in every other
state and also up here in Canada
you can't do a thing called unauthorized
practice of law you can't practice law
or give legal advice without a license
is against the law so for engineering I
also believe every state has like a
professional license by for engineers
license by for engineers were they're
doing the same thing but just like I can
sit here on the land show and generally
discuss legal topics like I am doing
right now actually without giving any
one specific advice you would think an
engineer could do the same thing but the
state of Oregon is saying to him no you
can't even talk about it without a
license because I think this guy doesn't
have his license yet so this is a huge
problem
ends up going to court he ends up suing
the state of Oregon for breach of his
First Amendment rights which is free
speech you can you can say what you want
to um and I think this is still going on
but they basically said that he can talk
about this as long as the lawsuit is
pending so that is where we are with
this okay yeah interesting I don't
understand legal stuff so I have
concerns and questions but I'm just
going to move on because they're
probably juvenile big ones that
$10,000,000 League of Legends tournament
holy
but chunks team applications for the new
LCS open today the buy in price is ten
million dollars players on the ten
selected teams get a guaranteed salary
of at least 75 well buy-in is ten
million yeah that the buying for the
World Series of Poker isn't even ten
million dollars how does that he's
pretty nuts
yeah Riot Games said it end goal is to
create a strong and stable system that's
profitable for pro players and provides
entertainment for fan
in the long-term and I guess they plan
to do that by charging ten million
dollars for ten teams which is a hundred
million dollars how many people on the
team you know like there there would be
five active players but you have like a
roster where you have yeah ventures like
there's there's other stuff going on uh
once the ten teams are determined they
are in the league for good Rai says it
will offer incentives to teams that play
well and penalize the squads that
purposefully that purposefully stay at
the bottom of the ladder what um teams
the tank for spur on purpose for some
reason why okay
so admittedly I don't really watch
eSports in the very long time stuff
played lol but what I can say in in more
traditional sports what certain teams at
times are especially in the US and
Canada it doesn't really work this way
in Europe but in the US and Canada um
teams will be accused of tanking if they
have no no hope of making the playoffs
so they end up taking for a better
drastic uh so whether this has ever
actually happened is a matter of debate
but like there's accusations of a
happening to pop up every now with this
so maybe it's something like that you
get some kind of extra benefit are you
the ranking in League of Legends no okay
thank you I don't think it's out were
slightly clearer we're not talking about
Draft ticks in terms of like when you're
drafting heroes for that game we play as
a lot of people that don't watch sports
at all yeah is we're talking about like
like the NFL's College Player Draft
where the war schemes can pick earlier
to help make them better so yeah
pick a player layer I got a person of
yam bean he's not dressed
yeah not draft picking like oh let's
let's Bend as real or something I don't
know why you'd do that I don't think
he's very strong right now someone says
they say not to get relegated which may
be true so that would be more like a not
to get relegated blocks Walker you have
a motion relegated yeah okay
interesting okay uh that's pretty nuts
that's fat it says so much ten million
dollar buy-in I wonder how well they're
going to do I don't know I almost wonder
if they would if it would help them to
have like teams represent specific areas
like real sports or traditional sports a
little salt anybody but I don't see okay
having a why you guys going to you
that's like a deeper topic but I don't
think so because I think with eSports
it's more of a global thing and because
everyone basically everyone is watching
online and maintained from anywhere
online yeah like there is I don't think
there's a lot of team it's just local
someone you're in that like
personalities you like yeah like I can
see a little bit more like national
spirit like if there was like the
American team that happens a lot in like
individual sports yeah a little bit more
traditional individual sports no we did
have a heroes to the dorm in the u.s.
were the larger colleges all inter
college teams into this so there's like
a little bit of that yeah yeah yep
interesting next up we have the first
rising based all-in-one which is
absolutely pretty crazy it's it's a dell
all-in-one so look at her it looks
pretty nice actually dell inspiron
twenty seven seven seven seven five AI
oh it's an 8 core AMD rise in seven
eight six numbers in a row alright great
maker he's freaking that yeah well I get
the 27th got to be 23 yes but but even
so like even so so it's the sense m75
ago or 7775 whatever you want to call it
ambi rising 7 chip radeon RX 580 and a
4k LCD screen and it looks pretty should
actually do some like pretty serious
gaming on it with no Rex 580 yeah yeah
the the chassis very vaguely reminds me
of the the surface studio for Microsoft
like a little bit you know like the way
the mouse is like the where the chassis
is yeah yeah
some of the seven seven seven five
this is worded a little bit weirdly but
I can get there I'm gonna I'm gonna jump
away from that actually come on in on
deck
well I couldn't tell if they were
talking whoa I just queued every first
the diabetes cure now this
okay so despite being yes so it's
actually the Inspiron 27 7000 series
these seven seven seven five is a
specific version there's multiple
versions of it the low-end version is a
quad-core AMD Rison 5 1400 with an Rx
560 with four gigs of gddr5 memory and
then 180 watt PSU but if you jump up to
the high end I believe that one that I
just noted is about a thousand dollars
and if you jump to the high end you get
an 8 core AMD Rison 7 1700 which I just
mentioned and then a Radeon rx 580 with
eight gigs of gddr5 and a 330 watt power
supply and I believe you can get up to
32 gigs of ram with one of these I do
hope the lower end one didn't go for
like the full like ball and 4k display
because there's no way you're going to
get 4k kisses does okay some don't have
it have the 4k so I seriously doubt that
the low-end one the bear bill is one is
a grand so here a meal here we go if we
scroll down a little look I do a they do
a better job so we're a display or
screen display there we go
yeah so the cheaper one is 1080p it's
still IPS so it's so going to be a
pretty good-looking display but it's
going 1080p yeah nineteen eighty bucks
that's gotta be a typo TV 1920 by 1080
yeah that's pretty interesting that I
think that is a typo yeah in terms of
USB connections which is like a topic of
much debate these days I do see Type C
which is good so they have two USB 2.0
which is fine they have three USB type a
or sorry they have three two USB 2.0
type a which is fine three USB 3.0 type
a which is good one USB 3.1 type C which
is solid and then one USB 3.1
a which is also pretty good the webcam
is 720p which is like actually a little
disappointing like still seeing stuff
showing up in 720p s yeah it's running
Windows 10 home 64-bit which is about
what you'd probably expect that's kind
of cool though it looks sharp I'm happy
to see AMD getting their products and
stuff like this so that's cool yeah it
also looks a little more elegant some
past gaming a I've seen I mean granted a
law that is most is more the GPU
manufacturers but even so and I think
part of this is that it I don't think
it's heavily aimed at gaming it's you
definitely male yeah yeah it is what
it's powerful of the the higher-end one
is definitely powerful enough that you
could but it looks more like it's
designed for like oh if you wanted to
edit some video or proto's yeah little
bit like from the comment the twitch
chat so it's 580 for 4k casual use is
great and I would agree with that so
yeah yeah there we go okay
moving on we're a little spin on topic
are we talking about the facial
recognition thing with the monkey so
we're going to talk about that where's
that it's down here it's under John's
Texas which is why I know what the heck
was going on - that shameless when I
started talking about it I'll get it on
screen so uh there's an article in The
Guardian here about scientists
discovering how the brain recognized
that recognizes faces by reading the
minds of monkeys more specifically
analyzing the brainwave patterns it's a
little different but you know and what
what they did was they they looked at
their brainwaves and decoded phases that
the monkey like human faces that the
monkeys remembered and you might be able
to see it on the screen capture here but
they were almost exactly the same as the
subjects appeared in real life which is
both cool and a little bit unnerving so
you know you start wondering about oh
well things like you know reading minds
and in that end reading thoughts were
once purely the realm of science fiction
but now you're starting to wonder ok you
know is this something that you know
actually has had some some water
to what you know some of them look like
video gamified versions of the real
people a little bit yeah so the
predicted phases are on the right and
the actuals on all the left yeah they're
pretty close though I can't read this
one I thought the predicted phases the
accurate one the National face was not
isn't weird because the actual face on
this one actually looks lower resolution
than the predicted face which is kind of
interesting and so you know you have to
wonder about you know is this does this
mean that a person could end up one day
with the correct equipment see Oh was
the person thinking but for who they're
thinking about and what they're thinking
about there I think they're also talking
about your brain encodes like faces a
certain way and it does much kind of
like a GPU would do like mathematical
transformations to like if you're if
there's a shape on your computer screen
and it's like rotating to see it it's
like a cube or a circle or sub spear
like whatever else your GPU is doing
mathematical transformations to it to
figure out what it looks like so it's
the article saying the brain work
similarly where if you have met a person
a couple of times even if you haven't
seen their face from every possible
angle your your brain can do these
mathematical transformations so when you
see the person again maybe just see them
like from the side or like from an angle
when they're walking away from you but
you can still figure out who it is so it
seems like it's tapping more into that
part of the brain as far as reading like
emotional thoughts that might be a
little bit different I don't know but
someone in the chest that's how to hide
your porn so like we did we'd have to
make like a version 2 of that video yeah
if I think of your grandma here's how
not to think about what you've been
looking at yeah yeah yeah well if I
could soon as you say don't think of a
pink elephant you think yeah so yeah
yeah yeah how to hide your porn version
to mind-reading edition that'd be
freaking awesome I should make that
video at some point in a thousand years
this might get litigated this is covered
the right to privacy the right to
privacy cover your own thoughts you know
I certainly think it does but who I mean
who knows who know at this point who
knows
they love to record you know what in
public you implicitly give up your right
to privacy some lawyer making that
argument like hundreds of years from now
so yeah yeah I don't know but Nvidia
announces GPUs first dinner gaming
laptops so they've got a few different
things going on now in videos looking to
find the fastest and most power
optimizer performance level to allow
laptops under 20 millimeters thick and
sported GT X 1080 we're already getting
pretty close are only like with the new
we're like the new razor blades you know
you can get a 1080 of those and how
thick are those you know I'm not sure an
exact thickness for those but he's
showing pretty thin freaking laptops
right here with this trademark leather
jacket very good with his freaking
leather jacket max Q it's cool
men are laptops is good whisper mode
blah blah blah blah we're constantly
getting ha c forbes even at least they
say from the web but like still come on
guys news websites that advertise
articles for clickbait news is such a
weird situation it really really is
because there's tons of people that
really can't tell the difference super
lame anyways that's that's just a cool
thing in videos trying to do that that's
cool mm-hmm they'll they will I'm sure
succeed if they're going to be this open
about the fact that they hey we're going
to do this yeah they probably already
done it as rocky mount's is ITX boards
for AMD risin that's super cool I've
been kind of waiting for I expected was
going to happen faster than it has been
but I wanted em ATX to get very popular
there is a serious serious lack of
really good-looking micro ATX boards out
there and that's part of the problem
yeah but I TX boards too like I I
expected to see more of this stuff going
on I think with fantex new
case I can't remember the new name for
it the old name for it was project two
one seven but as of this Computex they
have a new name for it I think that
might even help because fantex cases are
super popular and this thing is freaking
beautiful yeah I just wanna talk about
micro ATX in for a second because
because when you think about it if
you're an enthusiast it has to be the
most sensible form factor
you know because because no one uses
four-way SLI crossfire anymore but you
get two slots usually micro ATX so if
you want to expand you can you should
get like a little bit more i/o like but
most people are doing external backs not
internal sound cards anymore exactly so
you don't really need like it but and
even if you want like PCI Express based
storage most people are using MDOT to
Octane's coming up so that you don't
have to swallow it into a traditional
slot so it's just like why don't you see
more of this because ATX is overkill for
most people with the amount of
expandability that you're just never
going to use so yeah and you can get
some really nifty kind of small cases
but that's part of the problem too
there's a huge amount of demand on the
motherboard side so the cases aren't
there yet really there's a min son of
cases for it because of that and then
there isn't a ton of cases for it
because of that so people don't want to
build that form factor so there isn't a
ton of demand for the motherboards there
were in like kind of a stuck situation
but I wish to get a little bit more
popular
I hate stuck situations duck what schwag
says I didn't realize John knew this
much stuff yep and Nick for coming for
that and here watched a quickie yes
techo he is more or less unanimously
written by John it's it's essentially
like it's my channel and it's not I'm
basically creative director for whatever
it's worth I hope you will contribute to
it too but yes so but like I specially
on the writing side I'm like I run
entirely by bestially on the right I'm
trying not to sound like a jerk hogging
all the credit so but yeah okay but ya
know on the writing side is basically
the John show right now so yeah I think
that's probably about it in with the
show today yeah do we do we need to make
a pee stretch or
branch-like strap like you know when you
come to the end of a program but it's
not the end you have like blank space do
we need to like oh no no we get to roll
