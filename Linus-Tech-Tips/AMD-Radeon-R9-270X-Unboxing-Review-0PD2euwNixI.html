cube case is great for air cooling or
liquid cooling check the link in the
video description to learn more welcome
to my unboxing and performance review of
the Radeon r9 270x it's a $200 GPU
meaning it's at the top end of that best
bang for the buck $100 to $200 price
range and if you're familiar with the
7870 gigahertz edition this card is
going to look pretty familiar to you
so it's clocked at 1.05 gigahertz max on
the core and that relates to their new
power tune technology so when they say
max clocks the way power tune works is
much like in videos GPU boost 2.0 where
it factors in not only the clock speed
the voltage and the power limits of the
card but also temperature so it's able
to use all four of those data points to
get the most performance possible out of
the card at any given time when you're
overclocking pretty much the best thing
to do is turn up the maximum clock speed
turn up your available power limit and
then the card will pretty much do the
rest for you you can't do much with the
temperature limits because they ship at
their maximum recommended temperatures
from AMD at this time now the way that
the fan works with respect to
temperature is instead of ramping up and
ramping down quite sharply they've made
things much more gradual so it should be
a less noticeable change in sound
meaning that the card will be less
obnoxious to the ear when you're opening
up games or closing them next up is the
2 gig frame buffer this is the same as
the 70 70 gigahertz Edition but unlike
the older card it is also available in a
four gig configuration for a few more
bucks this might be relevant to you if
you're gaming at higher resolutions than
1080p or for future games however 2 gig
looks like it's going to be pretty good
for the time being and because this card
is positioned as a 1080p gaming monster
so maximum details 1080p it's up to the
individual whether that's useful for you
or not it has 180 wattle board power
meaning it needs 2 PCI Express 6 pin
connectors in order to provide power and
it has 1280 stream processors so that's
pretty much it for the spec ok supports
DirectX 11 point 2 it supports OpenGL
you would support
mantle so mantle is important it runs on
any GCN architecture card which this
happens to be it's pretty similar to the
last gen and pretty similar to what's in
the xbox one ps4 and Wii U and mantle is
a way for that AMD can allow developers
to program almost directly to the
hardware instead of going through an API
such as DirectX 11 volt mantle is an API
but instead of going through one that is
bloated and slow and bottlenecks the
performance of your system so mantle is
going to be launching on a couple of
different titles battlefield 4 will be
the first game with support for mantle
and what it basically means is that the
game dev has to code in a completely
different path and that sounds crazy
that sounds like a step backwards to the
olden days but it's maybe not because a
lot of the Vette devs especially if
they're cross-platform devs are going to
be doing this similar work on the
next-gen consoles anyway so we could be
looking at tangible performance
improvements for AMD cards on games
running mantle and for end-users it'll
probably be as simple as something like
a drop-down menu going from DirectX to
OpenGL to mantle and just seeing a
massive performance improvement which is
very very cool now let's do an overall
tour of the card here there's a large 80
millimeter fan and a blower style that's
going to exhaust air out the back of the
card we've also got a PCI Express 3.0 16
X interface here at the bottom the 2 PCI
Express connectors that I showed you
before on the back we find a plain PCB
with no sort of backplate or anything
like that and right here yes we find
more technology to DVI ports HDMI and
DisplayPort which might not look that
interesting but it is so DisplayPort
splitters are now a thing you can run
three monitors off of that single port
and if you don't feel like using
DisplayPort at all and you want to run
Eyefinity you can use two DVI ports and
an HDMI port and no adapters with these
latest generation cards the maximum is
1080p 60 Hertz or might work at 1920 by
1200 60 Hertz so you can't do you know
3d surround or anything like that
without implementing a DisplayPort
monitor in your setup but I still think
that's a major step forward in terms of
compatibility and ease of setup for I
Finity and that's not the only way that
multi displays implementation has been
set
simplified some 4k displays these days
in fact a lot of them are going to
require two cables and then they're
basically going to be two monitors in
one and AMD's new implementation on
these cards is going to allow for
automatic arrangement okay so the
monitor is going to be able to
communicate with the card and say look
this is the one that's supposed to be on
the left this is the one that's supposed
to be on the right and detection of
these tiled displays so that they're
completely transparent to the end-user
and you don't even know that there was a
configuration process that happened
they're also launching their raptor
gaming app which is more of a
co-branding exercise and it allows you
to interact with your friends across
platforms it allows you to launch
applications without closing down your
game it allows you to gives you rewards
for playing games and finally it
optimizes your game settings on your own
on its own without intervention so it
finds other people playing similar games
to you on similar configs finds out what
kind of performance numbers they're
getting and then allows you to select a
slider anywhere from quality to
performance depending how you want the
game to run and boom it'll do up all the
details for you in such a way that it'll
run really well on your system this is
to compete with of course the GeForce
experience from Nvidia which is similar
except it doesn't cloud source the data
from other gamers zero core technology
is included which basically allows your
operating system to power down the GPU
when it's not doing anything but
trueaudio
is not so that is the dedicated
programmable DSP that's on the 260 X and
the 290 series so you will still be
using your CPU for audio calculations
unless you either step up a whole lot or
step down a significant amount in terms
of performance now speaking of
performance without further ado I'm
handing this video off to slick to tell
you guys about the performance of the
270x compared to its competition the
charts presented before you are just a
compilation of all the cards that I've
been running on these three games over
the last little while now you'll notice
that the r9 270x has a running buddy
from the nvidia side but something to
notice in this little battle as well is
that the AMD card is about $50 cheaper
at launch although this is subject to
change obviously one thing that I do
notice with this price point is that
people are really searching for their
best bang for the buck so this is
definitely going to be a card to watch
because
that is right in that price point now if
you are someone looking for an AMD card
this might be the best bang for your
buck card out there will have to be us
wait and see if you liked the video like
the video if you dislike the video
dislike the video and in the comment
section below I'd like to have a
discussion about card rebadging it's
kind of a mixed bag all over the
internet whether people like it or
dislike it or what side they're really
fighting for their opinions about and
all that kind of stuff so I'd like to
see what YouTube commenters think about
card rebadging and as always if you like
