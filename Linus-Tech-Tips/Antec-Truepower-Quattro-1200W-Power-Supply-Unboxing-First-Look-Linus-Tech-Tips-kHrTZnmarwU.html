this one actually has something really
cool about it this is a feature that has
been you know I was a little skeptical
about when I first heard of it the
camera man is zoomed in on the right
thing this is power cache this is the
first power supply we've seen this on
the Antec true power quattro 1200 watt
this is a high performance capacitor on
some of the key connectors that delivers
an extra power reserve when you're where
you need it when you need it most so
basically what that means is if you
start to draw a whole bunch of power
from your full volt rail all of a sudden
that capacitor is gonna act as a bit of
a buffer and make sure that instead of
having a little bit of a dip in the
power you're actually just going to have
solid constant power so let's talk a
little bit about the basic specs of this
unit before I get home oh I'm opening
from the wrong side here that won't work
at all bullet okay so it's a 1200 watt
unit like I mentioned before it is part
of their true power Quattro series which
also has an 850 and a 1,000 watt power
supply but neither of those features
this interesting new feature and I'm
just gonna get up the spec table on this
yeah there we go okay so as I have not
mentioned yet this is an 80 plus silver
design so that means that you're going
to see efficiency I believe it's upwards
of 85 percent no matter what don't quote
me on that one though nvidia sli ready
so they've gone to the effort to have it
certified although i guarantee this will
run pretty much whatever GPUs you throw
at it I don't think it's gonna matter
there's your basic specs here so they're
telling you is dual quad-core ready it
has a PWM controlled fan six 12-volt
rails on this guy 11 SATA connectors we
can get to all of that once we get
inside oh yeah there we go there I
finally found that oh
they covered it with a sticker oh fail
ok well hopefully it's on the inside of
the unit ok let's get this open and
let's have a look at what is included
first of all you've got the product
overview which shows you the power
supply itself as well as which
connectors are included thank you for
that alright next you've got a huge
beefy proprietary power cable this cable
this is one of those special ones that's
usually included on
very high wattage power supplies then
you have a whole bunch of modular cables
we'll have a look at those in a minute
really nice foam packing this is nice
closed cell foam very very durable
feeling all right then we get the true
power Quattro 1200 watt it's oh that's
heavy
Wow okay Oh hold on poor black screws so
you can attach it to your case excellent
okay so open here like the rest of the
Quattro series the Quattro till 1200
does feature racing stripes which as
everybody knows does make your computer
go much faster okay see the racing
stripes so it'll go away faster okay
let's start at the back of the unit so
it has an 80 millimeter fan and there's
your there's your power input there's no
power switch so if you actually want to
completely power it down you will have
to pull the plug
alright then on this side we've got a
stamped antec logo as well as a couple
little ventilation holes alright over at
the front we've got just a complete
grille so that's where most of your air
intake is coming from we've got like a
semi modular interface on this
particular power supply so that means a
lot of the cables are pre attached but
you do have some modular cables in case
you don't want to completely clutter up
your case oh here we'll find the specs
so as we mentioned before there are six
12-volt rails on this power supply each
of which is rated for a whopping 38 amps
Wow
okay and then so the 12-volt rails
combined max load is 1200 Watts so you
could actually completely load this
power supply up to 1200 Watts just on
the 12 volt rail it's a lot of twelves
okay so then let's have a look at what
connectors we have included on the
Quattro 1200 do you know if I could get
those it all right a twist tie off then
I would be able to show you okay first
of all we have a 24 pin power connector
which has like a pretty cool-looking
little boot on it and that will make it
I guess look nicer more than anything
else okay cool next we have wow there's
a lot of there's a lot of connectors on
here this is going to actually take me
away just a brief moment to sort out
here sorry about that and
okay so we will discover that the four
plus four pin connector or eight pin
connector which it includes two of each
has this this capacitor feature on it so
all of your CPU power is going to have
that little buffer on it and you can use
this with a motherboard that requires
two eight pin connectors okay so we got
that out of the way next we have all
right next Wow these are these are great
okay so we've got two PCI Express
connectors here each on one cable I
actually really like this because so
many high end video cards these days use
two connectors as it is so you can got
you've got as much as an 8 plus 6 pin
connector on each of these cables two of
which are pre attached to the
motherboard or to the power supply so I
guess they're assuming that if you're
running a 1200 watt power supply you
better have at least two graphics cards
in your system and they both do have the
capacitor on it as well so that pretty
oh yeah no we've actually got one
pre-attached SATA cable which includes
three connectors and then we have one
pre-attached molex cable that includes
three connectors in one plot Bikaner all
right in terms of modular cables we have
a few more included here and actually oh
wow almost every cable on this power
supply does include their capacitor
feature I didn't actually realize that
okay so the modular molex and SATA ones
do not and the modular PCI Express ones
do and then everything attached to the
power supply itself except the 24 pin
does not actually you know what I'm not
going to bother undoing these okay
you've got two more modular PCI Express
cables okay each of which is going to
connect up to two PCI Express connectors
alright one 6 plus 2 and 1 6 pin and
then you've got what appears to be one
two three more SATA okay excellent and
then you have to do do two more molex
cables that look just like the other one
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the enttec Quatro 1200 watt
power supply
