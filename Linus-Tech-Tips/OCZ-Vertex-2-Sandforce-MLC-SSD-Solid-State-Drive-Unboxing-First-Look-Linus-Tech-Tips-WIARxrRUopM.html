of a new SSD from OCZ this is the vertex
250 gig
now the specs for the vertex 250 gig 100
gig 200 gig 60 gig 120 gig and 240 gig
it's available in a lot of capacities
are pretty much the same now the biggest
difference between the vertex 2 and the
vertex 1 is that the vertex 2 uses the
new sand force controller uses the SF
1200 and the whole vertex 2 series
unlike sand force controllers from other
manufacturers and unlike the agility 2
series has a special firmware tweak that
allows it to get better performance in
writes basically okay it's a
high-performance design mlc flash memory
trim support raid capability all of
those pretty much go without saying
these days and it includes a three and a
half inch SSD adapter for desktops
that's pretty neat let's flip around to
the back see what OCC has to say for
themselves here now this is the trick
read up to 285 megabyte per second and
right up to 275 megabyte per second with
sustained writes up to 250 megabyte per
second that's huge because the SandForce
controller actually allows mlc flash to
write more data than you are actually
writing to the disk now I'm gonna
explain what that means
it's basically compressing the data
let's say you've got 10 gigs of data
you're gonna just write to your drive
it's compressing it on the fly which
means compared to the older end links
controller it's quite a bit more
complicated but it means that maybe even
though it's writing 10 gigs of data and
then it'll read off 10 gigs of data it
might only write 8 gigs of data so that
means a your SSD will last longer
because you're using fewer write cycles
and B it will go faster because you're
writing that 10 gigs of data to in only
8 gigs so it'll go 20% faster and I
don't have a knife today but that's ok
you guys can live while I just cut this
open with a pen Wow they've really
improved the resiliency of their plastic
on the packaging compared to previous
vertex series drives there we go it's
finally off ok
let's get this opened up so see we had a
look at the specs oh it opens at the top
not the side how innovative okay okay
here we go
so they've updated their uh their
included foamy packaging thing to have
like a slot in the back where they
stuffed in a two and a half inch to
three and a half inch drive adapter so
there it is it looks like that I I don't
remember if I didn't unboxing on this at
some point or not but it's fairly
straightforward you just here pull the
drive up really quick so you just use
the screws on the bottom of the drive
strap them in like this and then you
attach this to your case using the three
and a half inch drive bay holes okay so
let's have a look at what else they've
included also some mounting screws so
four screws to attach the SSD to the
adapter and then four screws to mount
the adapter in your case thanks ocz then
they've also got a warranty card here
installation guide and warranty info
let's see how long is the warranty on
this one hmm four years there you go
three year warranty awesome let's get
the drive opened up here
caution content sensitive to
electrostatic discharge open only at a
static free workstation okay well
hopefully that won't be a problem for us
today okay so it looks just like the old
vertex drives actually this is kind of
funny they have changed the shape of the
sticker but they haven't changed the
shape of the outline for the sticker in
the top of the drive so it's a square
cut out with a rounded sticker in it now
also they've updated the label with two
rather than just vertex excellent
improvement there as well your warranty
is void if this is removed or broken so
you can't take the drive apart and then
let's have a look so we got our two and
a half inch mounting holes here we got
our two and a half inch mounting holes
on the other side and then at the bottom
we have more two and a half inch
standard mounting holes so this will fit
in almost any laptop or two and a half
inch adapter or case that supports two
and a half inch drives
is our part number so it is the two VTX
series okay and then let me see what
else do we have here yeah we've got our
SATA to power and SATA to data now these
drives do still run off of SATA 2 rather
than the new SATA 3 but the reality of
it is SATA 3 wouldn't really contribute
anything because the maximum performance
of SATA 2 is 300 megabit per second or
about weight isn't 3 gigabit per second
which comes out to roughly and this
isn't quite right 300 megabytes per
second so at 285 275 for reads and
writes this drive is still not
bottlenecked by the SATA 2 interface
anyway thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the OCZ vertex 2 SSD</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
