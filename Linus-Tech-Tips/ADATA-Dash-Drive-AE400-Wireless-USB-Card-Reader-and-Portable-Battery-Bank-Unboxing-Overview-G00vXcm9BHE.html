now to learn more well I guess it was a
matter of time someone was going to take
the whole portable power bank thing for
your cell phone or your tablet or
whatever and they were going to say well
it has a battery in it already I guess
it might as well do other stuff so a
data has brought us the AE 400 which is
hem a wireless storage device portable
battery backup as well as it if I could
get this plastic sealed yeah there we go
alright so it allows you it is a card
reader it is a wireless data storage
device as well as a power bank
all-in-one so before the first time you
use Wow look at this user guide it's
like a bajillion pages this better have
like 16 languages in it please charge 48
hours before using and it has 1 2 3 4 or
5 6 7 8 11 languages in it all right
well I'll give them a pass on that so
the device itself is actually reasonably
small considering that it's a five
thousand million power portable charger
there you go it has a single SD card
reader right there then it also has a
button on the top a USB port for
charging this guy and then an additional
USB port as an output for charging other
things so I definitely understand why
they have a bit of a beefy manual
because there are some intricacies when
it comes to using a device like this
that's very all-in-one but actually only
has one button they've taken the Apple
approach of one button is good enough
for everything you need to do but
there's no touchscreen so basically
here's here's how it works the one
button is right here integrated into the
pattern on the top of the device which
is actually kind of nice looking a
little maybe a little over the top for
the more manly of our viewers there is a
battery indicator here that is red
orange or green depending on battery
life as long as you're over fifty
percent that'll be green and then there
are little LED in
educators that show you what
functionality is enabled at any given
time so right now we are in wireless
transfer mode which is actually kind of
cool you download the dash drive elite
app and let's face it it is not as
feature rich as some of the other
competing products that are dedicated
like media streaming devices like the
corsair voyager air for example but what
it does do is it allows you to very
simply so i'm connected to the dash
drive air through Wi-Fi and it's just
all the default settings are documented
in the manual so that shouldn't be too
difficult and then you can use it as a
pass-through to connect up to 10 devices
to it at a time and still have internet
access so I'm connected to it and then
basically all i do is using either USB
or an SD card either of which is fine
you go to air elite and it just gives
you a directory listing of all your
files so you can do though I think I'm
ah yeah I already scrolled down because
i was using this before so you can open
up something like a word document or a
powerpoint should you see fit so here's
a here's a powerpoint from an episode of
net linked weekly that's just going to
open up right there so we can go ahead
and presumably yep there we go just go
back navigations a little funny like
back here will take me out of the app so
you use up here to navigate i think this
is because they use the same UI for iOS
as well as android which is not really
recommended but i mean it seems to be
working but so no continue playing so
we'll play this again so what's great
about the android version is because
android actually with third-party
players is able to support a pretty wide
variety of media format you can even
play videos directly off of the USB
drive that's plugged into the josh drive
air ayee 400 which is a complicated name
for the product but whatever on iOS i
didn't have quite as much luck with that
because the formats are a little bit
more restrictive but you can see the app
works in much the same way so there's
the whole file transfer thing but it
does more than that of course so you
cycle through the different modes by
clicking the button and it's going to
take you a little while to get the hang
of what the different indicators mean
they're not that easy to see but pretty
much what you can do you can wirelessly
read and transfer from USB or from SD
you can use it as a power bank you can
use it as a wired SD card reader
so that's simply by plugging it into the
computer the way that you'd normally
intuitively would and it'll charge while
you're doing that and then just plug in
your SD card in and then last but not
least it is wait I think I think that's
I think that's it I'm having a hard time
wrapping my brain around all the stuff
it does share a wireless hotspot that
wireless data transfer so there you go
guys no real frills no gimmicks but it's
these devices are getting more and more
integrated and I think it's cool don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tip
for unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and leave a comment if you could
see yourself buying an integrated device
like this versus something that's just a
power bank or just a mobile media
sharing device or whatever else don't
forget to like the video if you liked it
or dislike it if you hated it both of
them are fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
