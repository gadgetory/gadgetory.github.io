naturally i expect it to barely run at
all and have a ton of issues right off
the bat spoiler alert
at least in my testing it was totally
stable on all single card configurations
that I ran but I think Linus is planning
to do a test for our upcoming duel 980
vs triple 970 sli so down
so stay subscribe for that from December
13th to 20th 2014 you can save on select
until CPU Schnucks and SSDs with special
holiday rebates from select retailers
click now to learn more well I haven't
played any more than the first couple
minutes of the game I can't say how good
it is because of that but the internet
seems to be pretty undecided on the
topic from what I played however the PC
port seems fairly solid as it didn't
crash on me once and I didn't see a
single graphical glitch something that I
can't say for any other recent triple-a
game releases so the benchmark starts
right at the beginning of the game
honestly at this point in time I don't
even know the protagonists name I don't
know anything about what's going on all
I know is that you're being chased by
cops and if that's a spoiler you
probably haven't seen any trailer or in
the boxart for this game all you're
gonna actually do is just kind of chase
the checkpoints for the beginning so go
through all these fields smash through a
whole bunch of stuff what you're gonna
want to try to avoid is smashing through
cops or really heavy things like that so
farm equipment or cops is that will turn
the front of your car too much and could
actually affect the benchmark when
you're going across this highway there's
about three cop cars that come on the
highway so try not to t-bone them that
unfortunate horse doesn't die by the way
you just superhumanly moves out of the
way extremely quickly when you jump down
into the swamp try to aim kind of in
between the bushes here you'll see
there's a ramp if you're doing your
testing here it's not super important
whether or not you go around or over the
ramp but if you do one or the other you
have to do that consistently because it
does make enough of a difference that it
matters so go either over the ramp or
around the ramp no big deal now if you
kept on going straight there you would
eventually finish the mission and
continued with the game we're not trying
to
this game we're trying to benchmark it
so take a u-turn after you get past or
go over that ramp and start heading
towards the electrical tower off in the
distance what you're gonna then do is
get this freaking cop off of you and try
to go around the right side of the tower
and on to the highway you're gonna get
into the far side of the highway so the
traffic is actually going with you or
the interstate or something I don't know
this is somewhere in America so I'm not
entirely sure and then you're gonna go
along this for the rest of the duration
of your benchmark which should be
another 10 ish seconds one thing to keep
in mind when looking at our 1080p
numbers is that there is a 60 or 30 FPS
limit on the game regardless of whether
or not you're running vsync this
resulted in the max FPS for our 292 90 X
780ti 970 and 980 to be at the exact FPS
limit at 4k all of our configurations
had a fair bit of trouble and the only
card that actually hit the FPS limit at
high settings was the 980 even though I
think it kind of just scraped it this
game was surprisingly hard to run
considering it's a car game but it also
looked surprisingly good for a car game
I'm impressed
speaking of gaming I bet some of you
know they're pretty entrenched in the
new Wow expansion right about now well
if you've been thinking I really do
enjoy this new expansion but I wish I
had something to keep me entertained
while I tend to the endless duties of my
garrison then Hulu Plus has you covered
