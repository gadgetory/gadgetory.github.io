news events in a timely manner was to
have a huge budget for like a truck that
had editing stations inside it and a
satellite link to your local station
where it could then be broadcast to the
masses but personal technology has
changed this though in a huge way first
was the everybody has a camera
revolution that allowed the World Trade
Center bombings to be captured from many
different angles Alby it in very very
low quality for the most part then the
next big thing that happened was
broadband internet and the ability for
anyone for well next to no cost three
right YouTube to be able to broadcast
whatever video it was they'd captured to
anyone then social took the internet by
storm in the late 2000s once mobile
internet connections were pretty much
ubiquitous so you were guaranteed almost
if anything crazy was going down someone
was there with a connection talking
about it
following that more Internet
infrastructure improvements HD online as
well as video streaming gave rise to
sites like Justin TV and later the
gaming focused twitch.tv which leads us
finally to the next chapter thanks to
the unstoppable onward march of
technology for less than a few thousand
dollars an individual can equip him or
herself with a live reporting backpack
that allows footage and personal
commentary to be broadcast almost
anywhere live
so this is it everything in front of me
is what is needed to build your very own
DIY reporter backpack so for me it
starts with the laptop this is a UX 303
from Asus this is actually the same one
that I used in my can you edit 4k video
on a laptop video which you can check
out over here and the reason I selected
it again for this project was a I
already had it and B it's got a core i7
skylake processor which allows me to get
a good enough HD video stream for you
know to be better than what anyone's
going to be broadcasting from a cell
phone as well as the fact that it's thin
and light and has reasonable battery
life now obviously a laptop doesn't do
anything on its own so in terms of
software xsplit who actually sponsored
this episode the DIY reporter backpack
episode has provided us with a copy of
their xsplit broadcaster software which
is going to allow us to take our
multiple camera inputs switch between
different inputs and broadcast directly
to twitch.tv which obviously wouldn't be
the normal destination for something
that's not about gaming but we have a
twitch account and they're cool so we're
gonna go ahead and were going to do our
our testing over on there now as good as
the battery life is on this laptop it's
not going to be enough for what we're
trying to do so I picked out the
cheapest highest capacity 19 volt output
battery bank in our case it's a ravpower
23,000 milliamp hour battery bank off of
Amazon and I threw that in the backpack
next next came the capture device so
we've got an elgato hd60 here this
allows us to take an HDMI input from our
camera and turn that into something that
xsplit can understand which leads us I
guess pretty well into the camera now
this is a pretty high-end model this is
a Canon XA 20 that we use for our
channel super-fun videos but what I like
about it and what I would recommend that
you guys look for is something with an
HDMI output as well as something that
accepts a couple of audio inputs because
we're going to be using one of the XLR
inputs for a lavalier microphone from
rode that I'm going to wear on myself
and the other one for a shotgun
microphone that is forward-facing so
that I can collect sound from what
our event it is that I am actually
looking at remember guys sound is as
important as video for capturing an
event or a moment of some sort now I do
have a big beefy battery on it but I'm
going to pack my charger with me anyway
because right here I have a second
battery bank option this one has two USB
outputs but more uniquely an AC output
so as long as I'm carrying around the
power brick adapters for any of my
devices I can use this charge tech unit
here to get supplementary power with
that thing plugged into the camera it
lasted for hours and hours and hours and
hours next up is my my Phi 4G hotspot so
this was actually provided by Belle and
they gave me an unlimited data plan so
that I didn't have to use my phone for
this whole wacky experiment and other
than that I don't know really what else
to say about it other than if you're
going to pick up one of these for this
purpose make sure you have enough data
on it and number two make sure you have
one that allows you to plug into a
computer via USB or some other
connection so that you don't have to go
4G to the mobile connection and then
Wi-Fi to the laptop it is an option but
having a hard wired connection between
this and the laptop is a little bit
better for this one I'm going to choose
an outer wall of the backpack so that it
has as unobstructed and access to the
cellular network as possible not that it
really makes a huge difference for our
last two pieces the aforementioned
remote which I will be taping on to my
arm allowing me to start and stop my
broadcast and change scenes without
actually digging into the backpack and
finally my handy dandy reporters helmet
this will keep me safe when I am
covering live events and thanks to
Brendan's bongo tied selfie stick on the
top of it here will also allow me to
have my face be in the shot so I can
give commentary on whatever it is that
I'm looking at so with all that out of
the way let's go live broadcasts
something
we have nine viewers apparently okay so
is it the world's most elegant solution
I think we all knew the answer was no
this my friends is the future there's
not a whole lot happening around here
but maybe down this mysterious back
alley if there was anything that was
gonna happen though you can be assured
that I would be ready me and my trusty
counterpart that I wouldn't actually
need that's another thing that's really
great about my whole future of future of
live broadcasting concept is that thanks
to the selfie helm you no longer need a
camera person to accompany you to tell
you about I have definitely patented the
crap out of the selfie helm it's a
selfie stick attached to a helmet that
protects you from the people who hate
you and you can rest assured you're
wearing a selfie helm there are people
who hate you many of them I'm one of
them even though I invented the selfie
helm I invented the selfie helm solely
so that I could identify the people that
I hate this bongo tie system could use
some improvement I think a stiffer mount
there we go that would give us a bit
more of that leg GoPro look definitely a
lot less bounce alone while I'm standing
there's a guy running away he probably
stole that camera so we're back in the
studio I consider this project to be a
huge success actually which doesn't
necessarily mean that there aren't some
things we could do to optimize the
experience so I talked about it while I
was streaming but the amount for our
selfie camera the webcam that we were
using here oh I never mentioned the
webcam in the setup it's a c920 from
logitech so the mount for this could be
more optimal a little bit of motion
dampening but with a little bit less
bounciness would probably be best and if
we could find a lighter selfie stick
that might help as well in terms of the
battery configuration right now the
camera lasts for like hours and hours
and hours but the laptop only lasts for
a few hours so I
think finding a way to balance those two
might be a good approach if I was going
to try and build something like this for
everyday use that's another thing I
could have done a better job of cable
management of all the different wires
and cables to make sure that I could get
it on me a little bit more easily as
well as being able to extract the laptop
to change any settings and then put it
back more easily would be another
optimization I would make and I don't
know I guess I guess that's that's
pretty much it the only real change then
if you wanted to do something like this
would be to get a more powerful maybe a
quad-core laptop if you wanted to
broadcast in 1080p at higher bit rates
for my perspective 720p 2 megabit which
is what we were doing on the ultra-fast
encoding preset is I would consider good
enough for amateur news reporting but
depending on what you're going for you
might want to up the ante a little bit
which I guess leads us into the
conclusion this video is not about this
setup really anyway it's more about the
broader idea of the democratization of
news I mean 20 years ago 10 years ago
even five years ago this would be
completely unattainable a way of a way
of doing this reliably and with
sufficient quality whereas now I mean
yes the set up is like five thousand
dollars although two thousand as the
camera you don't have to do that and
that laptop is pretty nice as well it is
somewhat attainable for real people if
they were willing to save up the money
and it was really important to them to
do this and this brings with it some
major advantages as well as some
disadvantages so sort of the
disadvantages is that journalistic
training can be beneficial I mean there
was that mind you there was that recent
situation with the shooters down in the
states where the journalists were
running around disrupting evidence and
all that but in general they go through
school for a reason and just having
everyone willy-nilly running amok with
cameras recording everything is a
privacy issue potentially as well as a
factual information issue because these
people don't have the necessary training
with that said I would also tend to
believe that an individual who's doing
this out of
not necessarily to get paid is going to
be more inclined to attack the news
stories that they feel are important
rather than the ones that necessarily
drive ratings and sponsorships for their
news station in order to maintain the
massive staff that a regular news
station would maintain so let me know in
the comments below what do you think is
this a step in the right direction or
should we leave it to the professionals
which I guess leads us pretty well into
our sponsor spot which as I'm sure the
college-educated among you figured was
coming is xsplit so xsplit is the law of
broadcasting software that we use on the
LAN show as well as for pretty much
anything else that we do including this
really cool stream I did a little while
ago where I actually built a whole
computer with a couple of different
inputs a couple of different views you
can just switch between scenes with a
hotkey whether that's on a keyboard next
to you or on a controller on your arm
yeah that's right xsplit allows all the
usual video streaming platforms to be
streamed to and has great game capture
features that allow you to capture your
games with pretty much the click of a
button but there's more today you can
save 10% off a personal or premium
license for xsplit by using offer code
linus at the link in the video
description and yes my friends there is
even more we are actually doing an
xsplit license giveaway over at the
Linus tech tips com forum so check that
out then if you don't happen to win you
can save 10% and try out the
broadcasting software that we use here
