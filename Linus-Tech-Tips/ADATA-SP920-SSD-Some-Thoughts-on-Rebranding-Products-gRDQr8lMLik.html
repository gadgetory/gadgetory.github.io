this is an SST update and discussion
about the practice of rebranding
products as much as it is an overview of
the a data SP 920 SSD so let's get into
why this product exists if you're like
me and you feel like amped about
third-generation SandForce Drive since
they were showing off at Computex 2013
by a date I know less then you'll be
disappointed to know that despite a data
as close relationship with Sam force
this isn't a Sam force 3000 series drive
and we'll have to wait a little bit
longer for that but that doesn't mean
it's a bad product it's not the first
time we've seen SSD manufacturer source
different controller technology and NAND
to make sure that their products stay
competitive I mean heck even Intel has
done it so a dado went shopping and the
SP 920 actually ended up using mostly
the same internal guts as the brand new
performance drive from crucial the m5 50
so at the core of the SP 920 is a Marvel
91-89 controller with a crucial design
firmware and either 8 or 16 chips
soldered to the PCB that feature microns
a state of the art high-density 20
nanometer 128 gigabit NAND flash also
present is a cluster of capacitors on
the PCB that handle flushing data from
the RAM cache to the non-volatile NAND
flash in the event of an unexpected
power loss this is a feature that is
traditionally more common on enterprise
drives where an unexpected power loss is
actually much less likely to occur so
it's great to see it implemented on a
consumer drive as well now the choice of
n550 Hardware enables a data to deliver
a great set of features at a very
competitive price point with solid
performance you get trim and active
garbage collection you get AES 256-bit
hardware encryption with support for
Microsoft II drive and then you get like
smart and adaptive thermal monitoring
protection and all that good stuff but
can you just as easily get all this by
buying a crucial m5 50
directly why does this product exist
let's talk frankly about rebrands for a
moment what's good and what's bad about
them first the good things one is when
they offer some kind of a tangible value
add like a longer warranty or better
accessories number two is that it's easy
to find information on this drive and
evaluate its usefulness for your needs
because you can go and look at a review
of one of the equivalent ones even if a
site you like hasn't reviewed this exact
one number three is that more
competition does drive aggressive
pricing for consumers and number four is
that you get long-term support for the
product that is in essence backed by a
very large company with a vested
interest in keeping each and every
customer happy I mean an example of this
is something like a laptop
it's like eMachines doesn't invest the
Rd to keep giving you graphics card
driver updates for your budget desktop
it's okay because ultimately it's an
Nvidia graphics card and they're gonna
support it in the long term anyway but
what about the bad stuff when it causes
confusion because there are so many
options a customer doesn't know what to
buy I see that as potentially harmful
but many others would argue that more
competition is always better so that
ties into one of the positive points
number two is when a rebrand ends up
being slightly different in a way that's
not very well documented in this case a
data didn't do a particularly good job
of calling out that there 128 gig and
256 gig models don't perform as well as
the higher capacity ones or the crucial
M 550 equivalence of that capacity
review sites have performance numbers
for each capacity broken down but a data
site only lists the one terabyte drive
this difference in performance is
honestly something that the average
person wouldn't notice without
benchmarking the drive and it's due to
the use of fewer higher density flash
chips instead of more lower density
chips and it saves a bit of cost but
also reduces the drive sequential write
and read speeds so I see it as something
that should have been called out very
very clearly but the bottom line is
should you buy the SP 920 and the
conclusion comes down to this power
protection and class-leading encryption
support make this drive a super safe
place to put your data and the sp9 20
while not the best performing drive on
the market is extremely price
competitive compared directly with its
twin brother the m5 50 a data delivers
the same 7 millimeter to 9 millimeter
adapter and three year warranty but
throws in a Cronus migration software as
a key on the back of the drive and a two
and a half inch to three-and-a-half inch
adapter something that crucial doesn't
even offer in a kid anymore so - thumbs
