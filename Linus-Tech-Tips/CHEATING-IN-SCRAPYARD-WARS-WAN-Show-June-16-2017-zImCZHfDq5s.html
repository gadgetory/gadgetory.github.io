nothing ok the name Linus tech tips had
nothing to do with me being smart it had
talking improve Oh appears nice to
someone call criminal smart it's like
obviously you're talking about me look
okay so I've already told Paul I think
his channel name is very clever but I
think almost everyone who started a
channel like well before they thought
YouTube would like even be a thing
probably regret their their new name
yeah yeah like like there's that Tom's
Hardware
like don't ending three three three zero
three yeah yeah 3:03
like sob kaih low for like just all
those kinds of just it's like yeah the
guy makes video the guy makes videos
about a lot more than just sob yeah sob
even exist anymore
I love I love the guys on the forum
whose name will be like like no offense
to you if this is your name on the forum
some are like like GTX 780 oh then it's
like good a few years it's like a first
draft so there was a guy on the old NCIX
forum whose username was like connect
2004 and I'm like - yes nothing
interesting happened in 2004 ok 2004 was
one of the best use for gaming hands
down like this is actually a huge thing
a halo came out in 2004 World of
Warcraft original and release was in
2004 ok I'm trying to write no no
seriously look it up look up look up top
5 games and you doesn't fully understand
it if you google you can't even share my
screen right now but if you google top
games of 2014 we do this right now
because it's like this is the thing ok
you know my next you know my next
YouTube channel random to be fit with ok
half-life 2 doom free grand theft auto
san andreas halo 2 World of Warcraft
if you Far Cry Unreal Tournament realtor
number 1,000 plumbers realtor total war
okay this is looking like a pretty good
line a little Vietnam these are under
Brown planet has been wrong before star
wars my field Republic stable seems to
like weren't on a two foot giant game
hey Steve deadly shadows wasn't very
good okay but nothing is before oh good
girl hey Mouse mm for your
counter-strike source by the transitive
property this game I call duty game it
was still good okay Lord of the Rings
battle for middle-earth was better than
it got credit for you know so there's
that is tribe okay we're painkiller a
car Wars Battlefront okay alright
alright alright alright anybody this
might look like the end of that case oh
the guy didn't play games though so your
argument falls on its face right there
became actually on video games if it was
like a video games 2004 I would have
been like you know what that connects
one nothing in 2004 yeah but then he
could have just meant connect like like
is it derogatory Canadians yeah don't
know like we kind of embrace it but like
it I don't think there's a properly
derogatory term for Canadian hey yeah
Paul Paul Kyle so if I were to call you
guys like Yankee doodles is that
offensive or is that just like folks II
think if you add the doodle yeah what am
I called you guys yeah interview right
now is what you're saying basically
what's that good you want to I end this
interview right now because it's a yeah
we think we take very much offense I'm
triggered if I wouldn't I ever have
trigger trigger they haven't mentioned
that on why I have never taken more
offense to any words and Yankee then
yeah I love Paul I'm sorry
alright wait we can say to each other
because we're we are yeah yes I do that
I guess is it a residency thing or a
citizenship thing yeah yeah cuz he's a
citizen so is he allowed to just call
you guys Yankees
honestly I've been called a Yankee so
few times in my life and I don't even
know how it works
[Laughter]
Jim had some there was some like
etymological history to it I'm not gonna
look at those things you
it's all about context inflected right
Oh like 400 Yankee Doodle bastard I'm
okay what's up bro but if you're like
Yankee Doodle Dandy oh we got you got me
bro
we got a fighter here exact alright so I
should know the intro at some point and
then so we have Paul and Kyle on the
show to talk about the totally fair and
totally justified ending to scrapyard
verse 5 hmm and and I'm gonna roll the
intro they can still hear us all the
intro we have an intro poll to say no
you look better than Navy yeah Wow Wow
and I got the gh 5 I'm capturing for the
gh web that quality so many dicks on
this we have we have tinfoil over top
our camera so it's not tinfoil it's
special cine foil ok we should probably
spend most of the time talking about
Brandon's lighting configuration that
you set up here because I still haven't
managed to recreate it yeah this is a
snippet impossible you need to use a
laundry basket yeah the laundry bag
impedes the tinfoil in between the
laundry basket hold we have the light
set behind it at just the right distance
to create this illusion of like steps
and mystery to my girl Heather saw that
that first scene in scrapyard Wordsworth
in your garage that branded lit she was
like where is that other that's Paul's
garage she was like you mean that
well you see from every times really
good look at Brandon is that he asked
for all this expensive fancy camera and
lighting gear but then you give him like
like a roll of duct tape and some
chopsticks and and he manages to make it
look awesome anybody ever tell ya so I'm
tightening here going why am i spending
all this money when Brandon I used to do
Oh team like every show literally on the
planet I used to take like this
Instagram series of photos which was
like Brandon's ghetto lighting setups
that we would set up in hotel rooms and
stuff and like okay you have to give the
man credit for being able to work with
like the junk
sometimes have to work with but I don't
think that's like a credit to not
needing better gear I think it's a
credit to the crap that he had to deal
with for such a ridiculously long as a
matter of the definition of the word
made but no that is that's plant kill
versa have you ever seen the website
shitty rigs like shitty raise.com yeah
all these literally or more film
students who have to like build rig
material camera equipment out of just
like paper and ducted exactly like what
you're saying you would look at that
something like wow all the people on
here they really don't need better
camera gear would like really functional
city can't I would have red board I mean
if I was if I was paying the bill for
the gear then yeah I totally would
that's exactly how that would go down I
mean I remember and I actually this is
this is a true story I actually remember
making the argument to Brandon that we
shouldn't get C stands so for those of
you watching who are not that into
filming equipment or okay Luke's going
to go get one that's going to go get one
thank you Luke is there on the see stand
rec right there yes so this is a c-stand
it has three feet at the bottom and then
it has an extender pull on this side
here and then it has this clamp at the
top or this not be at the top that you
can use to hold stuff or whatever and
I'm like you have got to be kidding me
inhale pee hole rips it's a pole that
holds something and it's there like $200
they're not cheap for like the big ones
like that and I'm like and Brian is like
well we need a c-stand so we can put our
boom microphone on it and I'm like I'll
show you a boom microphone and I pull
this in fact when we're operating out of
the garage so I grab my motorbike throw
it in neutral roll it over and then I
like prop the boom pole like out of the
handlebars I'm like look problem solved
he's like no that is that is not a
solution I'm like can we record the
video right now like yes and then it's a
solution no seized and budget until
someone like goes the like lien thing on
the boom pole and your bike falls over
yeah
yeah all right Bobby done work for you
yeah sell your news now returnable scrap
yours now
I don't know were there any news topics
that jumped out to you guys do you want
to talk about the leaked core i9
benchmarks yeah did they take that down
yet or is it still just there um so it
was originally posted on the forum by
who's this PC guy 59 60 C this is sent
this is one of the 59 60 in two
generations out of date now poor PC guy
for PC got his logos in i7 he's going
full-bore yep I know I know PC guy never
stood at onyx so basically allegedly
where it is even from it was from hexxus
originally was from hexif let's see if
they've got it let's see if they've got
it pulled down they do not it is still
up but so just they're just like here
look at our bulbs I feel like that is
there they're just they're bad they're
just measure I should you should hide
those put that away before I ready for
that yet you know I mean this is
probably part of a much much deeper
conversation about the desperation of
the web written media like I mean it's
one thing to break an embargo with like
hmm how do i how do I pick someone who
wouldn't be offended a data like nice
people great people good product you
know you could probably survive as a
tech publication without being on the
best of terms with them though but like
giving the old middle finger to Intel
not in like a in like a criticizing
their product way because that we're
clearly done after that but in like a in
like a breaking a legally binding
agreement that you signed with them way
there's a difference between like being
overly friendly where you give like
favorable reviews because you want like
kickbacks or whatever and breaking nd
yeah a little bit of professional
respect for NDA's is just being a giant
jerk yeah and it's not just a jerk to
the brand it's also a jerk to all the
other publication
all other public and in this case Texas
might not have signed an NDA but they
did that knowing they're going to find
one under the table somewhere else and
they're going to screw over all the
other guys that are working with Intel
to get chips well now like all other
Creators whether it's text or video will
probably get at least a slice less views
yeah they're content when it comes out
because of this so it hurts other
Creators so you're being a jerk to all
your friends and you're being a jerk to
whatever company that's it
Texas is legit right I mean that they
have blacklisted to my knowledge at all
well bit yeah Andy yeah like where did
this information actually come from
that's the more interesting okay I
usually what I really see this kind of
oh well it's yes from some like sexy
Seattle video cards yeah yeah
publications that you know doesn't get
invited to Intel's events anyway they're
not on the distribution list for samples
or anything like that so it's weird
teams out of care this seemed like
something I was like wow they're going
to pull that down pretty quickly but I'm
yeah an accident it's still up so anyway
I mean generally the news is uh it'll be
a ten core 20 threaded priced at a
thousand dollars this is all allegedly
because it's a rumor until my NDA
expires and it performs pretty good any
thoughts uh good overclocking I mean
that's good to know
yeah I'm curious to see how the the
eighteen core is going to overclock
though yeah I would imagine like you're
basically you're going to be it's going
to come down to yeah overclocking is
going to be on a core by core basis
where you're going to actually have to
spend a long time dialing in an
overclock separately for one versus two
versus four versus a or 10 cores
depending on how the chips being hit you
might need some motherboard software to
you know hopefully asus or someone like
that developed some software they can
handle that sort of thing very a
symbiosis that's been doing that for
years where you can set different ratios
depending on how many cores are active
just I've never really bothered using it
because there wasn't generally much
difference between what you could do on
two verses six cores where now we're
talking about you know you can't be
running a
team cores at 4.5 gigahertz all at the
same time because it would it would melt
I believe they have a software an
operating system software that
integrates as well where it actively
just looks at whatever executable you're
running and digests it based on that so
it makes a little bit more hands-off but
can we talk honestly would you install a
su software on your system well remember
ok like Asian Lee close at 2013-2014 how
many issues we had with AI suite yeah I
don't remember an AI suite is banned in
this build it is when you think it might
even be better now most about like
here's all the the like the black magic
and spells you have to cast an order to
uninstall it properly and actually get
it completely removed from the awesome
yeah yeah it's the it it's usually
installed on systems that I set up to
test issues like capabilities like on
NHS motherboard but not much beyond that
on full time systems that I useful how
FAR's installing it how hard it can
brick that install if you ever try to
boot it on something else like that's
not a little shoes board and I'm just
kidding you're going how deep are you
putting your hooks in like a why why is
this necessary so I'm just looking at
some of the benchmark numbers on hexes
so unexpected it doesn't seem to have a
massive impact on gaming you know
there's a little bit of follow up
actually the Ryden CPUs they're testing
a 2560 by 1440 but their eyes and CPUs
it keep it up just fine the eight core
ones and the six core ones 3dmark I mean
it's just kind of that little
incremental increase that you get up
towards the top and yeah
running VR mark which I haven't messed
around with too much yeah gathered I
mean either made maybe a few years yeah
I'm checking on the baby no Luke's not
checking on the baby
Yvonne's got the baby I'm definitely
still here yeah yeah that would be a bad
thing
um yeah you're not in charge of the baby
no all right we've got another pretty
big topic before we jump into or do you
guys just want to talk
scrapyard wars now or do you want to do
one more one more topic we're ready for
your apology whenever you guys are I
mean it's hard to alright let's do
another toppings so this was originally
posted by wicked Paul on the forum
different calls that's a wicked Paul
you're like a flaccid pause I would I
would like to say that he'll is very
much like he needs to be the CRTC the
Canadian radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission just
issued a ruling stating that cell phone
service providers can't charge for phone
unlocking and that as of December 1st of
this year all new phones have to be sold
unlocked
how much do you wish that your
regulatory bodies cared about you that
much this is this is a hard subject for
a stock event not that'sit that's
awesome I am super happy for you guys
know Canada president ok you guys are
always really nice we're moving there
soon so yeah yeah I mean they don't know
that that's really cool how how
unfriendly a practice is this whole
phone locking thing like what the heck
you guys both bought pixels probably out
of frustration with that practice right
yeah I've been advising I think I had
been with Verizon pretty much all my
life like ever since the first time I
ever got a cell phone for like 10 years
ago or whatever it was and for the first
time ever I switched over to AT&amp;amp;T just
so I could buy an unlock pixel that's
what finally got me to switch because I
was just sort of sick of it you know
we've been doing we're traveling going
to copy text and things like that just
wanting to pop in a foreign SIM card
would be nice and I just couldn't
believe that my options were so limited
with Verizon so series it is a big issue
for a lot of us here I'm very happy that
this happened a bit to be fair though
how many times did we use that site
where it cost like $10 you still like
your phone well it can cost more than
that last time I did it I paid like 30
oh really
yeah it depends I've done it like four
or five times probably every time was
under $10 more obscure models tend to
require definitely more and sometimes
you
just like can't even do it and bail
blonde said I think it was like $100 to
unlock my old iPhone for like back when
we first started the company and I was
trying to use that as like a cheapo
travel phone yeah and it's just like
it's so frustrating and it's one of
those things where like I don't you know
I don't fundamentally disagree with the
the general sort of right-wing sentiment
that regulating businesses and putting a
bunch of a bunch of red tape in place is
destructive to business's abilities to
be profitable and to grow and to and to
maintain themselves but just the problem
is that we've seen time and time again
that no matter how unfriendly their
practices are and how upset it makes
their customers they just they just
can't they just can't be trusted with
this so I yeah I guess I'm glad I'm glad
that they stepped in because this is one
of those things where I think it's a
pretty tough argument for the carriers
to go like oh you are like adding you're
adding overhead and you're putting
strain on our business to maintain all
these separate SKUs and - and to
maintain all this oldest bloatware and -
and to know if anything we are
regulating simplifying things please
well it's just it's just it's just
purely unfriendly to consume ACA exactly
like and then like there's obviously a
lot of things that businesses will do
that are unfriendly to consumers but
this is like very unnecessarily
unfriendly to consumers it's purely to
lock people into the contract yeah so
tell Canadian telecoms made a total of
thirty seven point seven million dollars
last year charging customers to unlock
their cell phones wow it's a lot more
than I would have expected
yep looms telecoms warrant this is great
that if they didn't charge an unlocking
fee for the few customers who want it
done the cost would have to be passed on
to everyone so the CRTC was like okay
well then let's just not have locked
phones that sounds great yeah
then you don't have to charge anyone a
fee ever problem sorry mallalieu should
look at all this administrative burden
that we just lifted off the beat so many
question during I don't have to write
you're at a different way to make all of
that money unnecessarily from people
though that's a big challenge for them
and they're probably have to charge more
people more money in order to be able to
do that with okay yeah Colton wants us
to do a spot for this I want Cole to do
is document tolls or get over here today
Nicole pay that get over here to talk
about your stupid Sheraton this from
your stream yes okay yes so then I asked
nitros like hey you got any ideas and
then gave me this and then there's a big
argument whether we should have done the
one Linus face in the middle or we
should have done like multiple like six
and then we went with four thought it
was a good mix at a four is pretty good
and then now we're Sonam we've sold a
couple so how many have we sold I'm
curious at least 1000 Evans has one two
off this one to Luke if you mom forty -
Liam how many sorry where what's the URL
designed by human design my human notice
or timeline or two and a half shirt pure
cancer all right speaking of peer cancer
you guys are getting you guys cheating
and scrapyard bores okay so uh there are
a lot of our viewers who feel like who
feel like I ripped a deserving victory
away from you guys how would you address
that oh so you read all the comments on
the last video scrappy room I did I did
I do read the comments on videos because
because I'm like do I have a lot of
positive comments on my videos that are
nice to read maybe if you made better
videos you would like maybe you're
coming off science base and just stuck
to the same routine oh then maybe you'd
actually stir the problem yeah like if
you made this video about Intel's new
processors like you could have you know
made it like sad and walk around in the
rain and like actually given a heartfelt
speech about what's going on Intel what
I don't think you did know and yeah that
just you made the same cereal I was
inspired by J's video I was just copying
him yeah before
yeah funny J was on last week saying
that like he had been planning to make
that video and he saw mine companies
like I'm just going to do it anyway
anyway okay okay okay so how is what
what say you what say you because people
seem to think that we're like upset at
each other and that there's like
bitterness alright so uh first off I
think we just want to point out that we
in no way are here to drum up
controversy but if you guys want to
argue about that and what we're here for
in the comments please feel free to go
do so hahaha the main point I think is
that there was I think there were
problems with the following of the rules
that happened on both sides the question
in people's minds because we're not
we're not what i denying that we're not
trying to come here and say like we
didn't cheat or like that hard drive
that was in there would be bought or
anything like that where you didn't buy
it
technically at some point I might have
might have been example I'm not sure
exactly if example to your dollar value
so what we all go to Ashley does
everything do there's no internal tools
but but yeah I think I think if people
are upset it's because that they saw
that their worth was bending if not
breaking of the rules on both sides and
that if you were to negate those against
each other and say they cancel each
other out and it just fell down to the
strict performance of the systems which
in our case wouldn't have been affected
at all by a hard drive for example
there's that perhaps the higher scores
and the more powerful system the RGB
switch is sitting behind us that and
it's a nearly clearly but they all
you're forgetting that the entire
victory of this entire scratcher Gwadar
Jaden was determined by an unbiased
competitor of the actual contest oh wait
you're right actually Jesus I forgot
that Linus was the one who actually made
the final call at the q1 scrapiron
Tankian party in irish III apologize
okay okay so so my side of the
is that I was completely ready to
concede defeat
knowing that rules had already been bent
but not broken on both sides
Luke and I might have skirted close
mister where's hey look I want what Pulu
can I part of this how would I do okay
hold on yes you're inherently you're
inherently along for your year yeah I
mean okay look look think about it this
way it's not because you're cheating has
an aura doesn't mean that it's mine if
somebody is driving down a country road
and baseball bats are being used to
knock over mailboxes I'm not saying that
you hit her in the car okay technically
when we were in the car there was no
cheating going on okay so anyway anyway
anyway so Luke and I we're gonna cover
the logo with my bags later I'm gonna
totally legitimately only wear these
shirts on work days because then I don't
have to change my shirt when everyone's
different no well I didn't think of it
I'm not going to wear this shirt I only
packed these so pack something out I
know I did anything wrong
I didn't think it'd be walking shirtless
I could have lent the shirt in better
okay okay anyway anyway anyway the point
is the point is the negotiations had
been done already
with everyone that we talked to before
we got there so we should we are we we
tie we didn't get special pricing from
store dude yes what we did a lot of
people thought we did but he actually
has a supervisor that he bring us the
parts to and they ring it up they had no
idea we went more obvious than your
blatant shirt advertisement line is even
more obvious Matt is your voice well
there's nothing I can do about that
oh you could have had Luke do the
calling which scrapyard where's not many
of those voice modulators that you speak
into it it makes you sound like Darth
Vader's I won't hit discovery Blair's
having an issue for me which is that I
drove like I think it was like 430 miles
in three days or something like I just I
do
in LA that was impossible yeah yeah that
was likely my job yeah for this crap it
works yeah was I drove you like so you
also modded the front panel yeah oh yeah
partially incorrectly yes partially yes
that that didn't end up being what cost
us so sorry that I don't know that would
be a horrible implementation of our GPS
would know okay that was that was on me
Oh although when I was watching it back
you suggested it first but then using
your own mind
oh yeah it was 100% shows okay
okay so anyway anyway anyway anyway so
and okay so there's a couple things
number one is the pricing for the place
where we got the bulk of our hardware
was actually determined by to cashier
there's the cashier and there isn't
supervisor they had to call ya there's
two different people that had to go
through to get and the supervisor call
wasn't in the video so in the defense of
the audience who's like crying bloody
murder about that number do is the
people who are like yeah there's no way
someone would let you come in and fish
through things like that you know what
part of scrapyard wars is pushing the
boundaries finding and finding ways to
get people to make an exception for you
whether that's making vague kind of
weird sexual sounding promises by email
Kyle give you rewards that you can't
possibly add just have nothing to do
with my influence as a youtuber as that
was never specified before the actual
deal was locked into place sexually and
by the time I actually finally did
exchange money for prognathism who I was
and who you were
he still had no effing idea okay so all
that one giant maze continuing about I
gotta give the best value of the entire
thing to get over the hell we are
okay so anyway but my point was is that
people are like yeah the only reason
that guy let you do that was because of
who you are and you know what it's
possible that he let me do that because
of who I was but I wasn't the only one
at the shop digging through stuff and
those people weren't me there was other
customers and I'll be asleep in film
them multiple other customers and going
way back like 15 years ago
that's legitimately where they show
people things
also to be clear about that part the
first time I ever like took over the
tech area in a shop was at the Vancouver
NCIX
15 years ago as a customer I came in
because I had a motherboard army to do
and I didn't have the hardware that I
needed to swap out and troubleshoot it
so I brought in my board and they were
like we can't do anything for you for a
week I was like that's unacceptable I
have to play video games
look can I borrow some hardware can I
set up a spot on the bench here and can
I just walk things out and diagnose this
and they're like it's sure you'd be
amazed what people will let you do if
you just ask and if they are willing to
do all of it they don't have to do
anything initially know that you're
aligning no but I wasn't - tech tips
that's my point
she was Ashley I just like it going on
yeah ash Ketcham my detectives fan okay
this year so anyway going back to back
to the judging so I was fully ready
knowing you guys had bent rules of your
own like splitting up for examine that
was never made up front that was
actually that was until told us straight
up that we could do that no problem at
all Edsel was screwing with you because
people were watching our side of it
going why do these two go everywhere
together like a husband and wife we
wouldn't of that because that's the
window had to spend the entire
competition driving what do you guys did
argue like a married couple which was
which is classic bitter scenario we we
were it we're under the complete
impression that that was not there was
no rule that we had to always stay
together or anything like that I think
that was ever discussed up for yeah I
don't think that was laid up okay okay a
lot technically have it on camera camera
so like anyway anyway anyway so so so so
anybody but the point is that's not the
only rule that was bent on your side
either rules were bent but where the
rule I'd work see I would say we only
broke we broke the rule with the hard
drive the other rules I would argue
money what happened what about the money
one eye not even a bend you could even
tell after you guys are after Linus is
done rummaging through that warehouse
and by the way I feel like you guys were
still striking up a little deals long
after you
would arrived and met the guy Michel
face-to-face like how much would this
ban $5 but you're gonna charge me $5 he
told me creepers yeah you told me please
okay a lot of us happened off camera but
he told me it was free and then I was
like oh you know this is a pan of flow
right these are worth like 25 bucks okay
but even even so and I was like you
cannot charge me for something there I
told him you can't you can't charge me
for something that you didn't know was
worth anything until I told you it was
worth something that was my point and we
didn't end up using the fan anyway by
the way but you know what you know what
said it all for me though it wasn't even
any dialogue or action that it
transpired it was after you guys left
that warehouse and you're walking back
to the car the look and just the overall
expression on Luke's face nothing like
you had murdered a child hahaha I love
it told me everything that wasn't shown
on camera just want to say Luke I've
never seen Luke
so in distress you just I didn't like
the I did not like um that they knew who
Linus was that bothered me and I didn't
like it either but I can't phony so we
had talked to him open on the phone and
the deal we ended up with actually
wasn't quite as good as what he agreed
to in our initial phone call and forgot
about so that's another key factor going
way back to our first phone call he was
like yeah yeah yeah we can we got all
kinds of stuff it's amazing this place
is amazing we showed up there they had
like one CPU like it the place actually
wasn't as good as what was kind of sold
to us alright he's like trying to make
this like gaming parts sales outfit out
of that shop because he's like Trent
because his boss didn't do that before
yeah they didn't care about the gaming
parts they just want to resell all the
like business pcs yeah workstations and
office computers yeah like I think he
was trying to get us in there pretty
hard because he's like trying to show
his boss that there are customers for
this at all so okay okay um
yeah so that's that's my defense so the
one clear clear and obvious just just
red card violation of the rules then was
using your own hardware that that was
that was why and you guys and this is
this is something that we also wasn't
shown on camera that Luke and I will be
pulling the footage out of the archives
and showing it at our LTX Expo that at
the time you guys fully accepted the
referee's decision and is only now
you're fighting it you guys are fighting
it not seen your half of the Asia back
we didn't know any of the conclusions
was going on between you and sellers of
hardware our cheat was found out on the
spot your cheat was found out a month or
two several months after the whole
series had already been shot edited and
posted to the public so why do you big
different we gave you guys the benefit
of the doubt
assuming well they would never great on
same answer totally clean an acquittal
videos after wonder for he kept it super
clean for 500 could end up by that one
yeah I also have to consider that exults
when they edited this yes true and he's
a bit of a troublemaker and a bit of a
pot stirrer and you know what in in
edvald offense pot-stirring
gets views and creates situations like
this recognizing to watch okay so I'll
tell you what guys TV 101 let's leave it
up to the audience we ran a straw poll
it was about infallible ways anything no
a we go up well it's closer than I'd
like it in their defense I think they
also ran a straw poll and they won on
theirs by a lot more than we won on ours
that's true okay yeah but their viewers
hadn't heard both sides of the story
that's also true they had viewed they a
dude the entire you know four episodes
yes
they hadn't experienced all four
episodes no no one's experienced the
proper outro vote even rolling in fast
now I think votes are rolling in fast
now I'm going quickly that would be
freaking awesome I'm like renting out an
eye mass and just playing like a
marathon of the entire season I'll be
pretty cool that would actually be a
really fun like event speaking of
speaking of events do you guys have any
interest in coming up here for LTX when
is that I don't remember
oh no we're falling that oh oh yeah oh
oh oh we're getting close we're in four
points yeah up there towards four points
anyway you guys you guys don't have to
commit or anything but I think it's in
August I'm gonna days in August turns
into July I can't remember you know what
it's on the hold on I'm gonna navigate
in there - why don't you what are you
guys doing there you're like 29th July
29 basically it's a tech kana Ville okay
yeah so it's a con and it's a carnival
so we actually have like game against ed
Ville in csgo
so we have like actual like gaming focus
booths we have like Luke's running like
a VR thing where people can just like
try VR if they have a just cool um but
then we also have like a bungee run
where you just like run as far as you
can and then like a bungee cord you
stretch it as far as you can and then it
like rips you back into like a big
cushion so what you have to do it in
socks and sandals right no no I don't
even think you're allowed to wear
sandals on it so we've got it out we've
got a case toss see we are doing the
transfer cases yeah I believe even if we
don't find a sponsor for the case stuff
I don't even care we're just going to do
it okay yeah cuz I've had so many
questions like one case brand was like
oh oh why would we want anyone to do
that why would we want someone to damage
our case like who cares obviously it's
not about that like why I know but he's
casing our brand I know I can say
there's a thermal take their offices are
near here and I've gone through there
yeah and they have two dumpsters in the
back that are just full of dead cases
like case behavior yeah that they that
they decided they apparently can't even
use for scrap or anything and they're
just all dead kids how many though like
that's not even the issue they just got
like a
offended that we would think that they
would be okay with someone throwing
their product on the type of vendors you
want to market new or you're not knowing
or really been oh L Yash L right away I
forgot about Randall Josh would beat the
other than to blow up a case or
something oh yeah he shot gun one way
all right we should cut those cases with
a high-powered now this is kind of
incredible we have twice as many votes
now maybe more than 2800 votes and it
stayed exactly the same that's exactly
where you want to be when it comes to
the controversy Godiva controversy
eyeballs how's your how's your scrapyard
Wars machine back there doing by the way
is that part of your set now yeah well
nice it's great to finally be able to
like have it out there for PLC you know
and everything writing it for like I'm
three months I'm sorry that your guys's
build isn't available anymore I would
have expected that if you put so much
time and effort into you're proud of it
you wanna keep it for you know as a
complement or whatever but uh you know
if you guys left most of the bulk of it
here
I believe it ended up in the recycle bin
or the recycle baby - I understand
that's probably fair I understand I
understand
Luc's dremel work was uh I did take some
pictures of it okay that would have been
good if you had a reinforced blade I did
right so I did find I reinforced blades
oh that was another thing that I just
couldn't believe especially watching
that so it's like I have I have a
sawzall right there okay okay okay there
now and I have metal cutting blades for
it and I have my what else do I have my
my other saw where they do ah there it
is that was easy
I'm going to do an internal hole yeah
when I'm on a Windows all you would cut
out a window with that get real get real
and okay I'm just saying if you lost
your cutting disk and you were like
there's nothing because that's why you
guys sent one I didn't see that you
you're gonna do how are you going to do
that I'm going to do
and with re3 in response to all the
viewers who are like there's a hacksaw
right behind you
we have my 15 minutes yeah we'd like 18
minutes so like yeah wrap electrical
tape around a hacksaw blade and go ham
like it's steel and we have 18 minutes
my jigsaw though there's a jigsaw on the
on the shelf or in the jigsaw that would
have been a pretty rough hole like if
you're not using a rotary in it it would
have done it well what if it wasn't
through it it's tough to get like really
clean cuts even with a dremel though no
I'm not I like actually do that all the
time yeah I wanted finishing on the
hedging like you don't you don't do any
filing or anything like without a file
if you angle the blade and use the flat
part of the blade you can still file it
down that way yeah at least cheating
I've actually done this like what I
believe you they actually mm PC tech
they have an old-school video on doing
that where he goes over that that that
technique and everything so I I do
believe you there and I honestly I do
wish that I had remembered at the time
where my cutting blades were because
that wasn't something that I had
intentionally like wanted to kinda okay
it's a V night that we wouldn't have won
the RGB part anyway no cuz well you
wouldn't have are way cooler than are
okay are but if we would have felt he
didn't better because it wouldn't have
been like wow we obviously should win
this it would have been like wow that
was close
our plan which I don't know what
everybody's don't would have destroyed
them our plan with the windows was to
have the windows and then we were just
going to take literally the pile of RGB
lighting and just throw it into case so
like it wasn't actually going to be a
lot better we were going for like a like
a hashtag irony like camps or
implementation of it in the first place
argument it was just supposed to be a
slightly more sensible one the RGB mid
tests make it super ironic oh yeah yes
exactly that was kind of JD I really
like that kind of dark take on things
too so that probably would have played
well with him yeah I mean although we
couldn't have competed with again more
rule bending the brides that some people
had for the judges huh which really held
no weight in the end we didn't even yeah
I don't even give a shot
with our students that I had that didn't
work out for whatever reason so we had
to present that I mean if Ellen ever
sent from England oh so we couldn't just
leave that yeah it wasn't but if it was
included in the money that they had for
the event that's actually completely and
it would have been completely aboveboard
yes oh yeah technically think you could
you could bribe the judge yes it would
just have to come from money the loose
on a computer I have what was I bought
candy when I come down to get my ones
yes our parents car fared worse all we
have to do is give all the budget money
to the judge up front like we don't even
need everybody well as long as you only
want 10% of the possible score then yes
then that would work out perfectly
in those rules and you and you had a
judge with very poor morale I was anyone
else blown away when they saw viewers
being like what are you guys talking
about March was this really filmed like
three months ago
yes you mean if you see a ten minute
video and clearly takes ten minutes to
make ten minutes ago I enjoyed all the
people giving me advice after like the
first one or two episodes that aired of
how we like how we should go about doing
things next yes right guys I had some
sweets then awesome comments oh you guys
should do this
the next time whatever is then you could
totally win I have you people trying to
give me suggestions on where to buy
things and like actually really good
ones I was just like I can't use this I
thought I had someone who was like
really positive like they were like they
had my back
someone else was criticizing something
about the show and they were like well
you know what it's really expensive to
produce I mean you know with a week in
between they've got to be like flying up
and down all the time between their
studio and LA to make their other videos
and I'm just like oh dude I project but
like no yeah I saw that comment yeah
yeah no no that isn't how it works
Oh anyway we tried to fly
no someone's suggesting in twitch chat
that we do a follow-up to this just like
as I like a like a score settler okay
where there's no budget line you only
get to use your YouTube fame to acquire
part we have actually considered it yes
we have considered it you me so heading
that would probably work to some degree
yeah just all the review Timothy ever
gotten this I would feel so weird doing
that big hey it has been news alert
I get hardware for free all the time
please give me some patience but I'm
sure there would be people who would be
happy to do it you know they get a shout
out and all that kind of stuff yeah
awesome place you go I don't know link
and I have actually discussed that
concept out before with like some pretty
detailed specific and the reason we
didn't do it because ultimately it would
just end up being who can build the best
rig with at that time
6950 X's dual Titan XPS 128 gigs of ram
and like a massive SSD raid array like
it you're gonna get it all that's that's
that's the like problem with it because
there's just going to be like ok give it
back to me when the show's done because
we had even talks about it as at like
because remember we didn't tell you guys
what the challenge was going to be until
we got there because we didn't decide
until we were sitting in the airplane
waiting for our connection are in the
airplane in the airport waiting for our
connection on our way down there and we
were like ok what do we do and that was
one of the ones we pitched I was like oh
they're down in the City of Industry
area so literally every tech brand is
there why don't we do use whatever
connections you want get whatever you
can to cap off the like ego wars like
ego wars idea you could have like like
state the area that the judging is going
to happen yeah and then just get a
totaled average out of all of the fans
that show up so it's like literally just
an ego competition
but you can post the benchmarking
results and everything but they get to
decide which one they like think is
better the problem is that I am for some
reason so unpopular can imagine why that
whenever it is a popularity contest so
so so kpop might lose you're not okay
with doing it at all yeah which is
exactly why I'm so unpopular oh my
goodness oh man all right you guys did
say you had to go after half an hour do
you have to go uh we can hang out for a
few more minutes this if you guys have
more interesting stuff to talk about
well we're running right up against our
sponsor spots so we were kind of had to
do that so if that's a good time for us
to cut out then then then that would be
okay with us
okay sure well okay so once more thank
you guys for being part of the whole
thing I hope it was legitimately fun
even though you only got a consolation
prize we had a good time it was as we
hate to admit it yes
we never whores was genuinely fun it was
great I think especially since it was
like the old-school lightest Alliance
media group guys who came down here that
was really cool to hang out with you
guys so yeah of course you know we're
still super pissed that we lost in
everything but thank you thank you for
having us on scrap yard wars and for
bringing us on land show guys well
holding dear to our hearts
you really will we'll be in our hearts
forever all right thanks guys thanks
guys everybody yeah my hero
oh here he's down there looking his way
that's Paul's dog for those I'm sure all
right I've got a yeah yeah all right all
right so back to back to the land show
spawn two spots we actually have we have
a couple of a couple sponsors today are
they back I think Savage Turkey static
it is great because it going to get to
eat the dirt I'm Colton will actually
hit us if we eat the jerky when it is
not a savage turkey sponsor tyo savagely
yes avidly savage jerky they're jerky is
made with the best ingredients the back
all of my friends called me and they
were like no it's the best know it so
that you know what I'm not doing it
today though no your turn oh you're
doing a spicy one today I'm eating the
cracked pepper and sea salt which morons
ones really funny prick which one I get
to tell you good to pick oh well you
know what I did it last week and no no
I'm not going to give you the one that I
did last week okay so the one I did last
week was the I don't even know Reaper I
thought so this is a 5/5 alarm1 yeah but
the reason I'm not going to give you the
Reaper is because from my experience the
ghost pepper buffalo sauce one is
actually worse okay great awesome so
that is a jerky the goal was to create a
snack that was full of flavor and spice
that wasn't bad for you and the
inspiration for their flavors comes from
garlic lime and cilantro and whatever
else is on the front of the package
since it brings out the natural flavor
of premium beef people love the sriracha
bacon maple buffalo bacon and of course
the traditional flavors we love you guys
loving watching us suffer so we eat
though really spicy stuff which is
really not for the faint at heart that's
all that's left in there
those were any more yakety-yak go for it
they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce
and a spice rub there Carolina Reaper
hot sauce uses one of the hottest
peppers in the world the Carolina Reaper

just really good our next lot is for an
ever-popular FreshBooks sponsor

can check them out over at freshbooks
comm slash win and claim your free trial
today how you do it over there
absolutely fine I don't know it's not
even that oh look at that we do have
another patch yeah like I think there
just wasn't enough okay all right all
right you know how there's like you can
actually see the like spicy stuff on
this jerky yeah I think maybe those two
little bits like all right and good
there's a full package baby no cheese
I've always I've always got a full
package for you oh just the smell the
smell is oh the smell is Savage I
donated a alright there we go now we
actually have a new sponsor on the show
for you guys today
spectrum oh I guess I don't need these
anymore you know so our genes have
actually been using these for quite a
while at his station so staring at a
monitor all day it's actually no secret
that the blue light can be more harmful
for your eyes than some other
wavelengths and spectrum basically aims
to make bear glasses an affordable
long-term solution to staring at a
computer screen all day you can use
software solutions like flocks and
Twilight but they don't give you the
same type of filtering that glasses do
features include being stylish and I'll
let you guys be the judge of that I
think we look great though yours look
good I don't have no real context for it
like if I look at that I only see oh
right you can't look it's like straight
on right yeah I think you look beautiful
thank you high-quality they've got a
one-year warranty and low colour
distortion so the idea is to block
high-energy blue light while keeping
colors as similar as possible they're
the highest rated among competitors on
Amazon and they're primarily focused on
the Canadian and US market
but they will be expanding to Europe and
will offer shipping internationally so
you can check them out at spectrum
glasses comm slash collections slash
products or at the link below the video
use offer code Linus to save 10% I'm
still doing okay I'm having some more
jerky really yeah you can handle the
ghost pepper now I wonder if it's just
tolerance because we've done this so
many times
mommy literally maybe because I there
was one show where I ate the ghost
pepper and it wrecked me or was that the
reapered I thought it was both it's hot
like it's really hot but it's not like
there's been I know there's been times
where I like can't handle it they should
have like random little I'm going to
keep talking about savage jerky I do
it's what they should have like a
challenge pack hmm that's like a little
bit of like all of their spiciest ones
that's a good idea and you can like you
give your friend as like kind of like a
joke gift or something like a challenge
pack of beef jerky like see how hot they
can get that's actually a very good a
cool idea
they'll probably watch the spot and they
will probably make a challenge pack
because that would actually be super
interesting to consider it yeah all
right we've got some big news here the
original article is from Bloomberg call
it like the government Facebook chases
televisions seventy billion dollar stash
with its own video series so Facebook is
apparently crazy starting to fund the
creation of video series that will begin
to appear on facebook.com so they're
closing deals for their first batch of
shows which will be available via a new
video tab on Facebook that is not there
yet by funding original programs
Facebook hopes to entice more production
companies to upload premium video and
we'll use them to siphon advertising
dollars away from television I mean
here's an idea Facebook if you guys are
really serious about video why don't you
actually share some of the ad revenue
with the people who are already
uploading video on your cut on your
platform like we upload to Facebook but
we don't get paid for it
so yeah that would be that would be
maybe a thing you
it's interesting that seems to be the
flavor of the month like self-produced
proper TV shows that you host on a
website I'm saying like Netflix kind of
blew the heck up at night instead of
redistributing everyone else's stuff I
started going really really hard with
making their own things and actually
canceling contracts for redistributing
other people's stuff and more being a
platform for making their own things
Amazon video is doing it like crazy now
Facebook is doing it YouTube's trying to
make their own like show like content on
their own Premium Plus that's what kind
of blows me away that YouTube has been
so incredibly unsuccessful at it yes but
they're trying yeah it's just like it's
kind of remarkable yeah anyway they're
funding two kinds of programs hero shows
will the expensive series from
established TV producers that will take
a few months to produce and spotlight
shows will be cheaper videos from
publishers like Vox and BuzzFeed all
shows will be episodic and designed to
spark conversation among Facebook users
what do you think Facebook has paid
celebrity to do this live video feature
and encourage TV networks and movie dos
duties on movie studios to stream live
events and trailers on the social
network for free promotion but this is a
whole other thing I think it's kind of
interesting what's getting a little bit
frustrating for me is now that there's
all these platforms we have the same
kind of issue that we had before like on
TV yeah where it if the idea was that
okay you buy your cable subscription and
you've got access to all your content
and now there is having different
channels now you need all the different
packages and it's like oh my god paying
the costs of uestion if you got to this
cost so much now which is frustrating
and then now everyone has their own
platform yep so now it's like oh before
if I like I watch TV show right if I
want to watch TV shows I would just
subscribe to Netflix yeah and now it's
not even that like I'm not even just
saying this because of floatplane but
it's my main frustration is that it's
actually all in different places so
here's here's one argument and it
it doesn't actually help with the last
thing you just said but I had already
kind of committed to saying this before
you said that so now I'm stuck yeah at
least even after you subscribe to
Netflix and Hulu and Amazon Prime video
and YouTube read and Facebook video I
don't know if they're going to charge
your HBO GO and floatplane even after
you subscribe to all of those things
you're still paying less than what like
Nick pays for his cable TV subscription
so if you're a cord cutter you know I
hear that it's not that bad only better
than all cord cutter it'd be nice of it
all consult like it'd be nice if Plex
could just yeah like that would be
bringing all Gavin that would you know
what Plex make that
yeah that's honestly my biggest
complaint is that I have to go all over
the place and like it's a little bit
frustrating because even with all these
bajillion different platforms I still
can't get everything yeah I want to
watch Star Wars rebels I can't right you
can't do it in Canada legally like yeah
I know there's like multiple many
different ways to pirate it which I
found while trying to buy it legally
because I couldn't find a way to find it
legally and there was all the pirate
ones right at the top because it's so
hateful to be fair for the people that
don't know we're in Canada that's why
it's a problem yeah in the space it's
not a problem
Wow it's by the DVDs I have to do at the
end of the season that's what I'm doing
I bought the first two seasons on DVD
viewers on the show of tanks since Paul
and Kyle left we should get them back Oh
Kyle come back please help us yeah um
all right moving on to our next topic
then the iPad pro outperforms the
MacBook Pro in some CPU and GPU tasks
the original article here is from 9 to 5
Mac and it was posted by hey yo on the
forum now to be clear we're talking
about Geekbench I think in this case
which is not the be-all and end-all of
you know performance benchmarks
necessarily and this is very much an
apples to oranges comparison but they
they stacked the 2017 and 2016 MacBook
Pro with touch bar
up against four different iPad pro
models and put them through a series of
Geekbench and GFX bench tests looking at
CPU and GPU performance yeah I'm usually
really against like just blindly hating
on things but oh this in the chat said
comparing crap with crap great and I
just I just yeah is good I like that one
well the MacBook Pro is not the latest
one like but I think what he's saying is
like I like yeah but it's probably by
not a huge amount and like I don't know
if this is going to influence anyone's
purchasing decision so no because
they're completely different devices
yeah like a it's like saying that your
toaster outperforms your oven in some
benchmarks yeah that's nice and they're
both heat stuff up like they're similar
in that in that way but in much the same
way that you wouldn't you know edit
video in a serious way on an iPad pro
you wouldn't you doing bacon turkey in a
toaster so but you could not the whole
thing on a toaster oven
well okay you could make turkey in a
toaster if it came to that really still
will lose away so the apparently the
twelve point nine and ten point five
inch models did edge out both MacBook
Pro models and for multi-core CPU
performance though the MacBook Pro came
out on top but in second place the 2017
one in second place was the ten and a
half inch iPad pro so the couple of
caveats the benchmark tests are not
necessarily anything to do with
real-world macbook pro models have
larger higher resolution displays and
the ipad pro's would play a role
especially in GPU tests and iOS the
software is nearly perfectly optimized
for the devices it runs on whereas
there's a bit more room for error when
it comes to Mac OS look I don't know if
that's necessarily a valid yeah that
doesn't make any sense I don't know how
that ended up in the notes alright
leaked AMD's epoch 7000 series
we don't have Xbox 1x news in the dock
xbox 1x oh yeah do you want to talk
about it sound of the dock I can go find
a thing another name is stupid yeah cool
again
yeah so AMD epic 7000 apparently it's
supposed to launch on June 20th oh wow
ok that's really soon so oh ok no maybe
this is just the NDA lift so it's
supposed to be according to this article
up to 32 high-performance Zen cores
8 channel ddr4 memory with up to 2
terabytes of memory supported per CPU a
hundred and twenty eight PCI Express
Lanes
an integrated chipset whatever that
means I think they just mean an onboard
memory controller maybe they've brought
some more stuff on board and sock it
compatible with next generation epic
processors so AMD has talked about this
they have a plan for then moving forward
this is not a one-and-done
so the idea is no compromise on one
socket something something something a
bunch of graphs and look at that they've
got like a whole a whole line up showing
how they plan to compare against the
existing v4 Zeon's very cool all right
they're going to have up to 180 watt
server chips holy actual moly that's
incredible alright then cool so that's
all rumored though we don't know any of
that for sure another rumor this was
posted by Nvidia Intel AMD love triangle
on the forums well that's a that that's
a user name that will never get unfunny
because that sure not happening upcoming
this is originally from goo 3d upcoming
GeForce GTX volta cards apparently to
use gddr5 X not hbm to like some of
their high-end workstation cards so the
DP 100 actually already uses HBM 2 and
to my knowledge the tesla what is it
that be 100 or whatever it's called the
new one the the Volta based tesla card
oh yeah so that one is going to use HP
m2 as well but no the rumor here is that
let's have a look here
while HBM two would offer potentially
some performance improvement it is
simply too expensive for consumer
products at this time and if the rumored
pricing of AMD's what what are they
calling it frontier frontier edition for
tourism yeah I'm pretty darn sure it's
Frontier Days yeah
bag of frontier addition if the rumored
pricing a frontier edition is anything
to go by looks like it's going to be
around $1,200 to $1,800 then I think
that that may that may just be the case
and there might not be a whole lot we
can do about that I'm going to try to
make this very quickly I don't
understand what this means okay so I
think that's pretty much I think that's
pretty much it in terms of all come oh
wait whoa hold on a second what is this
what isn't real what is this what hold
on a second Inside Edition calm is this
is this real whoo a seven-year-old
great-grandmother is opening up after
surviving five days trapped in her car
after crashing 40 feet down an
embankment five broken ribs are broken
back she told Inside Edition she was in
pain but considers herself lucky whoa
what it wasn't too long before her
family grew worried her nephew bob bob
bob be a smile Oh Stewart that's
freaking awesome no way when Bob saw the
car for the first time after her rescue
he got emotional as memories came
floating back that's understandable when
I first heard a voice I was just looking
over the edge the more I looked the more
I could see the brush was disturbed a
little bit holy crap Bob you're betta
their only clue was a ping from a cell
phone tower that covered several miles
along Route 12 which is about two hours
out of Sea
we didn't know if we were looking for
just a car or just the phone he recalled
they had to search hundreds of roads
nearly impossible to access holy cow
look at the car oh no this is a
different one
never mind the others cry and it
swimming pool I don't think there's
pictures of this Wow
way to go Bob so I misunderstood the the
headline here scrapyard wars for
champion saves a life I was like I
thought I was reading five I was like
I'm sure Paul and Kyle would might have
mentioned that also they didn't win and
so neither if I didn't deliver violently
here Wow so yeah Bob from Vienna 903 can
found his Wow way to go Bob you oh man
man oh this is great
so originally posted by Linus touch tips
on the forum well whatever that means
original article Tom Gregory 3d razor
launches a new blade stealth with a 13.3
inch display in a new gunmetal color
option so if there was any doubt in my
mind before as to whether or not I am in
razors good books right now this pretty
much seals it I didn't hear about this

case you're looking for it the name is
really dumb the again just like always
the name that they had before xbox
Scorpio was pretty freakin cool and they
just can - that went with Xbox 1x I
