new single GPU graphics card King is
here this is the geforce gtx 680 from
galaxy it's got a three year warranty
two gigs of gddr5 memory at 6 gigahertz
features DirectX 11 as have the last
couple of generations of GeForce
graphics cards sli physics and 3d vision
something that is not mentioned on the
box so that it also supports is
invidious around in 3d vision off of a
single card so NVIDIA has added that
functionality to their card you can hook
up up to four displays in three gaming
plus one auxilary and you can have 3d
vision running at the same time off a
single card so let's see if there's
anything going on here ah yes
key features NVIDIA GPU boost morale not
in a moment adaptive vertical sync is
cool because what it allows you to do is
turn on in videos adaptive vertical sync
so vsync as you guys may or may not know
will prevent tearing so that is those
artifacts that look like you got half of
one frame of half of another frame sort
of slightly offset as you turn in game
or move around in game so these thing
prevents that but also locks your
framerate at 60fps and it can cause some
you know most leg and stuff like that so
adaptive vsync turns vsync on to prevent
tearing and then off when your framerate
is below 60 so what that means is that
when you're below 60 what can happen a
lot of the time is you'll be locked into
a frame rate that is a multiple of 60
like 30 or 20 or 15 instead of running
at you know 42 or 25 so you'll be able
to squeeze the most performance out of
your card when it's not running at 60fps
but be locked at 60 when it is capable
of it in order to prevent tearing so
that's kind of a neat feature
handles really tight in there okay let's
keep going here invidious around which I
mentioned already for concurrent
displays including two dual link DVI
HDMI and DisplayPort 1.2 this card also
includes support for 4k displays so that
is super high-resolution displaced
DirectX 11 with direct compute 5.0
physics yes cool 3d vision SLI CUDA PCI
Express 3.0 this is the first PCI
Express 3.0 graphics card from Nvidia as
partners it's suggesting a minimum of
550 watt power supply but what you guys
are going to find out about this when I
do my review on it which is probably
going to go up around the same time as
this unboxing is that the power
consumption is actually phenomenal for a
high-end card so thank you for
purchasing something something set up
easy quick steps for quick installation
guide and whatnot okay cool and then
we've got the card itself so let's hold
on let's see what galaxy includes in
terms of accessories and then we'll
start talking about some of the
additional technology points that I want
to cover about this graphics card here
we go I can figure out how this comes
apart very nice okay so we have a DVI to
vga adapter we have two molex to single
PCIe 6 pin 2 molex to single PCIe 6 pin
that's funny guys high-end graphics card
to 6 pin adapters will more on that in a
moment
graphics card driver installation just
download the latest as well as a user
manual
ok so fairly straightforward accessory
package here nice packaging overall
though looks good very black alright now
the card
now in terms of its physical appearance
it's a very similar looking to a GTX 580
in terms of its size in terms of the
cooler although there are some subtle
differences but let's have a look at the
overall physical aspects of the card
first so we've got two sli connectors
meaning this card does support 3-way or
four-way SLI there's our little galaxy
sticker it's got a green GeForce GTX
thing going on unlike the GTX 590 it
doesn't look like it lights up or
anything but it does look pretty sharp
I'll give them that this is cool check
this out
two 6-pin PCI II connectors also what
Nvidia is done by putting the two 6-pin
PCI II connectors in the same place as
they've bought themselves some extra
room on the PCB to do other things you
can see actually I don't look at this
looks like it'll be up to it'll be up to
home that's bizarre it looks like either
they changed their mind at some point
between having a 6 and an 8 pin and then
they did like two six pins but then it
looks like you could either put them
here in here or here and here maybe it's
up to the board partners at some point
in the future to decide how they want to
implement it but there you go this is
the OEM one and NVIDIA says that bought
them some room for additional PCB
components versus doing it the other way
it should also be fairly tidy to cable
managed this way because you can either
come up in one column or down in one
column from a cable management hole so
that's very very cool we've got the
usual Nvidia blower style fan that we
find on most OEM cards with galaxy's
graphics on the shroud itself on the
back of the card we find not a whole lot
we find the PCB is right flush with the
cooler this is something that's very
confusing to me about AMD cards and that
is why Indy
insists on continuing to do this where
they have the PCB ending here and then
they just have an additional like random
bunch of plastic that makes the card
unnecessarily up to a centimeter longer
than it actually is I ran into trouble
installing that 7970 into a shuttle X PC
bare-bones the other day because of that
extra overhang there so Nvidia does not
do that here's our PCI Express 3.0 16 X
slot so that's capable of up to two
times the bandwidth of a PCI Express 2.0
16 X slot on the back we find a bunch of
other components and whatnot so you can
see where the RAM chips are installed
all on the other side there's no shroud
on the back of this card so you can see
the bare components you can see the GPU
is right under there and then on the
back we find the i/o so there's our two
dual link DVIs this guy's a DVI I this
is a DVID so the difference is that this
one supports analog output we've got
HDMI as well as DisplayPort 1.2 and then
we've got a little vent here and a
bigger event here and this is kind of
cool check this out so you guys see how
far away the cooling fins are in there
can you see that really um the actual
fins cooling the GPU I guess that's kind
of tough isn't it okay I'll try and get
you guys a better angle okay can you see
in there how they're angled they're
swept back like that yeah
excellent okay so NVIDIA has done that
for a very specific reason it gives some
dead space between the actual fins of
the GPU heatsink and the shroud at the
back so this is much like using a spacer
on a radiator in order to eliminate any
kind of dead zones and as well as to
more evenly push out the air so so you
give the air a little bit of room to to
accumulate and then come out evenly so
I'm not describing this in the best
possible terms honestly it's late and
I'm tired but but the point is that it
you are able to exhaust air more
efficiently with less resistance from
the sea the the metal pieces in the
shroud and it's generally better some of
the air is going to come out into your
case so there's a gap here there's a gap
here but most of the exhaust from this
blower design is going to go out the
back of the case so if you do have a
case that doesn't have great ventilate
this is usually a better choice than
going with the more typical aftermarket
designs that you see such as ah these
kinds of dual fan implementations that
blow all the air into the case alright
moving on here so well what else we got
here ah GPU boost so this card has 195
watt TDP so that is thermal design power
and what that means is that the clock
speed whenever you're designing a
graphics card you want a particular
thermal envelope that you have to meet
that the reason is pay for power
delivery you have to make sure that's
going to be within spec and be for heat
dissipation so you can only dissipate so
much heat with your reference pool you
don't want the the actual GPU to start
producing more heat than you can
dissipate because then you're going to
run into trouble okay so what that means
is that when you design a graphics card
you go okay I can apply this much
voltage I can apply this much clock
speed and it stays within this TDP now
Nvidia took a bit of an innovative
solution that may or may not have been
inspired by something like Intel's
turbo boost and that is they allow their
GPU to turn it clock speed up in less
demanding games and applications to
achieve overclocked settings on its own
so their GPU boost technology is capable
of taking the 1006 megahertz clock speed
up to five typically five percent or as
much as 10% above that stock clock speed
as long as it stays within the thermal
design specification so that's one
really cool feature GPU boost okay FXAA
has been added to the Nvidia control
panel so this is a faster form of
anti-aliasing and you can now force it
on in games even the ones that don't
support it so that's a really neat thing
as well we already talked about adaptive
vsync TxAA rolls 1 &amp;amp; 2 so Nvidia claims
and I'm going to be hopefully taking a
look at this in the future that mode 1
is about equivalent to a times AAA with
the performance hit of only two times
anti-alias
and move to provides significantly
better image quality than mode one with
only the performance hit of four times
multi sampling anti-aliasing so the more
traditional kind so that's really neat
as well we've covered three point one
three plus one displays 4k monitors for
better physics performance and ven C so
video encoding hardwork and run faster
than the CUDA based solutions in the
past and can also run concurrently with
the CUDA cores on the graphics card so
you can all bakudo course to handle
pre-processing while the NVE NC so
envying and I guess that short for
encoder I can have a lean coating the
three heat pipe dual slot fan I guess we
can't really see that but the way this
works is instead of using a vapor
chamber like we've seen with a couple
previous generation graphics cards from
both sides which is just like a big long
kind of like a big square very flat heat
pipe it uses three heat pipes one in an
S shape and then two in C shapes coming
out from the GPU to keep things nice and
flat to evenly distribute heat to the
aluminum fins inside finally it has 1532
cooler pores it clocked at oh I
mentioned this sort of briefly but it's
clocked at just over one gigahertz the
stocks beat a little boost up from there
as well as six gigahertz on the memory
and finally another cool thing about GPU
boost is that it will actually scale
with overclocking on the card so you can
overclock your stock speed and your GPU
boost will actually scale up from there
as well and while I haven't tested it
yet I'm really hoping to see some
interesting overclocking results with
this particular GPU so Nvidia claims two
times the performance per watt of the
two generations ago flagship GTX 480
meaning we've got significantly better
performance at what is apparently with
based on the 195 watt TDP significantly
better power consumption so that means
you SLI users out there are in for a
treat because your power bill is about
to go down when you upgrade to a couple
of these puppies so I think that pretty
much covers it thank you for checking
