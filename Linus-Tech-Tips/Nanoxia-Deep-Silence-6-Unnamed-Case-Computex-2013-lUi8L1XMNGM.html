powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM alright guys i'm here at the new
noxee a booth and we are here to check
out the deep silence 6 this has a bunch
of cool features and just lead us off
yes we will start in the front where you
can see and the in the top you open the
door to the right side with four times
Oh didi you do have to channel fan
control here for three photo three fans
each who's that button in the bottom
bottom door you have two times 140
millimeter fans we just open like this
and a really really cool thing about
these as you can see you just pop open
and then you can slide out a filter so
you can keep these and clean them very
very easily slide that back in right
here and then no screws needed for the
fall defense because she's just so as
you can see right here they can click it
out and click back in really easily so
really really easy to install your fans
really really easy to clean the filter
that's awesome it could just click back
in like that and you're good to go so
that's awesome for maintenance and
original installation yeah you expect
somewhere the i/o panel which is hidden
here you got the four times USB 3.0 HD
audio for sure and 2 x USB 2.0 this is
very nice because of really really large
motherboards will come with dual USB 3
headers and Haswell motherboards now z87
chipset tsar often coming with dual USB
3 headers so it's nice to have the
support up here and as I said it hides
away you don't have to really see it all
the time which is actually kind of
Awesome
now my favorite part by far if we can
turn this a little bit we did it to do
favorite part by far is this slider
right here yes this ladder is based on
the actually from the deep challenge one
but this is the advanced or improved one
because if you look at the fans of this
radiator they are not turning now but if
you open the roof the vents will start
spinning once you close it again they
would stop on this case we have 360
radiator in the
a very thick one we I think it's a 50 or
54 millimeters okay we do have three
fans on top three fans below so six
friends running on those you can adjust
by by the fan speed we do have 290
millimeters radiator here with the two
fans we saw before two fans at the hardy
cage inside and two or more here so we
are talking about 12 fans already in the
system 12 fans tons of thanks to its how
the fangs really links into a PCB that
runs this fancy mechanism here that'll
turn off and on the fans which is
awesome because if you're going to start
gaming if you're going to start
benchmark if you're gonna start doing
something crazy you can open it up look
like that the fans will turn on but if
you're just doing office work listening
to music with open headphones doing
anything like that where you want your
computer to be very quiet you can just
close it up really nice and easily turns
off the fans it's awesome if your water
cooling with a massive radio like that
you probably don't need the fans running
all the time if you're just doing very
low-end stuff anyway so that's very cool
a lot of space in here that's why we
show them for VGA cuts and the XL ATX
motherboard if you don't use a radiator
on the hob a cage you can get another
base for hard drives and you can build
up up to 20 one half price into this
case so you just have all the hard
drives in existence I know I've said
that already today but holy crap that's
kind of insane you can run the biggest
raid you could ever need for a personal
house either in here you almost don't
even need your own server at that point
even if you have insane amounts of media
so that's awesome very cool throw in a
raid card in there I would suggest if
you're gonna have that many hard drives
because plugging that into a motherboard
is not really going to be that great
what might be very important for many of
you is to get the cables away from the
front side so if you do look in here
we do have about two and a half
centimeter space in the
I can very easily fit my fingers in
there and curl them a bit so there's
tons of tons of space I know we can't
get it in a camera very easily right now
but there's just me there's a ton of
space back there
that's awesome do you want to cover this
a little bit still on the progression so
I tried I guess we're gonna move on
we'll show you some more cases in anoxia
booth comment what you think about this
it's really really cool
alright guys still then anoxia booth
we've got an unnamed case here actually
it's it's it houses a subwoofer on the
inside which is kind of different it's
coming from an oxide no no I'm kidding
it just looks like home theater
equipment and it looks like a subwoofer
in my opinion so I just wanted to throw
that terrible joke out there for you
what you have to say about this case the
special on this case is oh it falls off
from force of easily no the special in
this case is you can put on long power
supplies strong for power supplies you
can use long VGA cards we're talking
about mini ITX and not micro or normal
late ATX you can fit in here 280
millimetres radiator in the front and
into the top I don't know any other case
you can do this in flat 2 480 you can
use 240 for sure 240 as well there and
if you turn it around see very small
things here you can take out these have
a harddrive cage install the hard drives
put it back in you can do the same on
the motherboard tray just look at the
screw take it out install the system
hold it back in it's very nice for these
small cases because like installing hard
drives in a case this small can be
really difficult installing a
motherboard in case this small can be
really difficult so it's nice feel to
pull it out install it easily and throw
it back in another thing to note here
real quick is that just on the back the
power supply right now it's it's a
sample it's not named all that kind of
stuff is very new I'm very happy that
they're showing it to me the power
supply will be able to be rear mounted
so you don't actually have to try and
bring it in on the side here you can
just put a bracket on it slide it in
from the back and screw it in you're
good to go so that's actually great is
there anything else you had special
about this case yes if you use a
radiator in the top you can but you have
to exchange the top 10
design to a mesh design right so that
you can actually breathe the same we
will have on the side panel which just
fall off you can choose whether to use
the mesh function or the clothes
function we do a fit now on the top
right so you will have a very silent
system or an airflow system just as you
want to have right so this side panel
that we have right here will be solid
like the top is or you can put this mesh
on it if you're going to mount something
there if you want just more airflow at
all but if you want it solid it'll be
much quieter which is great thanks for
showing us this case thanks for watching
all over an anoxia content if you like
it if you like this kind of subwoofer
style case you like the home theater
style please like the video comment on
