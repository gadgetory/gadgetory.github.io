showcase on Linus tech tips this is
actually something that I personally am
very excited about this is a hard drive
but it's a very special hard drive this
is from seagate goflex series now if you
remember I talked about the goflex a
while ago the goflex drives basically
have a an enclosure around a bear drive
which doesn't sound very advanced but it
is because the cables the optional
cables for the drive it they usually
come with USB 2 and then you can buy USB
3 or asada or firewire or whatever the
case may be the cables actually include
the chips sorry about that battery
anyway like I was saying the cables for
goflex series drives are actually what
contained the chipset that converts the
signal from SATA which is the drive to
whatever interface you choose now this
one's a little special here let's take
the product out first and I'll explain
more about what it does shortly so the
first thing we find inside is a quick
start guide the quick start guide shows
us everything that's included as well as
some basic functionality so let's leave
that open and let's have a look at what
we have included with the drive so
here's something I say I'm not sure
exactly how this one works yet so I'm
you know we're taking it apart we're
we're on a voyage of discovery here
together you guys okay no idea we'll get
to that after next we have a wall wart
okay so this is pretty self-explanatory
this is for powering and charging your
drive right here we have the USB power
cable so this combined with this is what
is going to be used to power in charge
your go flex satellite okay here we have
a USB 3 cable included that's a very
nice inclusion because it does cost more
there's a USB 3 chipset in here there's
your USB 3 b cable right there going
into the back and there's a USB 3 cable
that goes into your pc so there that
goes to the SATA interface on the goflex
which is here so we have the 500 gig
model okay now it's a little heavier
than most of the two and a half inch
drives that you're going to find on the
market and there's a very good reason
for it because now i mentioned charging
the drive how's this work okay give me a
moment here guys nevermind i got it okay
that piece comes off the back if you do
want to use the bowflex interface on the
back so there now it's a normal tuna
half-inch drive but I mentioned charging
it this is a wireless drive it is a
satellite drive the reason it needs to
be charged us because it has an internal
battery as well as an internal wireless
chipset so what this drive is all about
is sharing your data wirelessly with
your mobile device okay so it's it's
most of the marketing and advertising is
geared around the iPad so here's what
seagate has to say for themselves i know
i did this kind of backwards we looked
at the product first then we look at the
package but let's do the package now
take your entire media library with you
stream it to your ipad wirelessly it's
for ipad android pc and mac you can
start over 300 movies so i just so you
guys are clear I'm not only going to
show iPad in this video so I do you know
I have a zoom here as well so when I do
the demo video of this product i will be
showing it on both platforms so you can
fill it up using USB 3 or USB to
remember this USB 3 cable that's
included is also USB to backwards
compatible you can charge it it lasts
for up to five hours of continuous
streaming and you can use the free app
or your devices web browser to stream
your entire media library wherever you
are and we'll have to try that will have
to try the the Apple App Store app as
well as the browsing method so you can
play up to three different movies on
three different iPads or mobile devices
at the same time works with tablets and
smartphones too so that means iPhones
Android phones iPads iPods all of that
good stuff and your entire me the
library is just as mobile as your iPad
now so I showed you guys that it does
work with the goflex interface but you
can also just take this cover throw it
on there like that and now it is
completely sealed
in so all you're going to be using it as
is a wireless device I press the power
button you can see it's got a power LED
as well as a wireless activity LED I got
your Seagate logo on the top I know I
haven't really shown the drive very well
yet there's the power button on the side
okay got that over there we got our
power in so that's your charging you
leave that charge it remember last for
up to five hours so that means you
should take your charger with you if
you're going to be on a long flight for
example or if you're going if you're
traveling okay we've got little rubber
feet on the bottom this is a nice
addition because most mobile drives like
this are designed more for pocket
storage but this one seagate has
considered that you're going to have it
kind of sitting somewhere and then
you'll put it down and then you'll
actually be using a device nearby so
they've accounted for it to not slip off
of a surface that you put it on while
you're using it to watch movies on your
iPad or on your android tablet and I
think that's pretty much everything
there is for me to say about it at the
moment why don't you just come over here
and have a look at the system
requirements so I'll let you guys read
this if you're curious about it but
obviously you'll need some kind of a
mobile device with Wi-Fi you'll need a
pc or a mac in order to load the files
onto it in the box we already went
through that and here's the support for
file type so you guys should check this
out and you do get up to 25 hours of
standby so that's really handy so you
charge it up before you leave you throw
it in your bag and then you can actually
use it continuously for up to five hours
so you can watch at least two full
movies maybe even three shorter movies
on the goflex satellite before you have
to charge it very cool don't forget to
subscribe to NCI XCOM my other channel
to see the performance evaluation and
review of this particular unit this
cameraman figured out what this is it's
a car charger that's outstanding so
you're on a long road trip I mean the
examples I gave were playing examples
but this is even like this is even
better so you take your USB charger
cable you throw it in there you plug
that into your car and all of a sudden
you have unlimited streaming for Wi-Fi
for all of your passengers in the back
seat so if you're driving somewhere with
your kids you throw them with the tablet
the back there watching movies you don't
have to buy the super expensive model of
your car with the TV's built into the
backseat now you bring around your own
TV screen your own media library and it
runs the whole time no matter how long
you're driving for it absolutely
flipping brilliant that they included
