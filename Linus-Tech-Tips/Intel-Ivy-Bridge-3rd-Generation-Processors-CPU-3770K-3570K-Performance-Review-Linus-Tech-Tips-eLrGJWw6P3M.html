so in front of me here I have a few
different processors some of the
processors that we've tested are
represented by boxes here some of them
are not but I want to start with
outlining the overall Ivy Bridge lineup
so we have everything from the lowly 34
50s so this is a core i5 that's a dual
core that has no K at the end so that
means this is not an unlocked
overclocking processor although you can
still overclock it a little bit but a
very very very limited it also has a 50
at the end of the part number and what
that means is that it has HD 2500
graphics and that will be important for
one of my other videos where I'm going
to do an onboard graphics roundup where
I compare the 2500 the 4000 the older
last generation 3000 that was on Sandy
Bridge as well as AMD's 38 70k APU that
has their onboard Radeon graphics so
let's hold on let's keep going though so
for the rest of lineup so what all this
means
I seven means you have hyper threading I
five means no hyper threading the 30
whatever seems to have some sort of
indication in terms of the rank within
the product stack 50 versus a 70 means
2500 versus Intel HD graphics 4000 which
is significantly more powerful from our
testing and then the K at the end means
that you have an unlocked processor that
can be easily overclocked and in this
case the 3770k sample that we were
working with was able to easily achieve
4.6 gigahertz and that's 24/7 stable in
fact that is the setting that we used
for our max overclocking results so you
know what I guess we might as well just
go with here I'm gonna hide the IGP
showdown actually no I shouldn't yes
I'll hide these ones for now there we go
so let's let's just go through this you
guys let's do this is like a one-day so
in terms of the tests that I ran my
timing was fairly limited so with a
single GTX 680 I ran most of this other
stuff so PC mark 7 Cinebench as well as
you
saying either quick sink or no clink
sink to quickly convert a video using
arcsoft Media encoder 7 so I took a 1
gig file and then I outputted it in an
iPhone 4 compatible format and timed how
long it took so I'll do that as sort of
round 2 through all of the tests so PC
mark 7 wise we can clearly see that the
Mac's
overclocked 3770k you know what I'll
turn these into graphs all right so
we're just going to do these one at a
time here's PC mark 7 basically this
doesn't benefit as much from multiple
cores as you might expect so our eight
core processor the 8150 from AMD as well
as our six core processor the 3930k
don't actually do that well I mean that
3930k score is a little bit better than
its Sandy Bridge brethren remember this
is sandy bridge-e but the 8150 just yeah
doesn't doesn't do that well in this
test you can see that it does however
benefit from significantly higher core
clock speeds so once we overclocked our
3770k to 4.6 gigahertz the score
dramatically improved and we do get a
slight boost from hyper-threading here
you can see however though with Sandy
Bridge we were pretty much within margin
of error on these two processors so yeah
all of this take it with a bit of a
grain of salt remember this is still a
synthetic benchmark here's our Cinebench
test so you can see this was run in two
different settings single threaded as
well as multi-threaded so you can see
that single threading runs according to
you know increasing down the graph so
that's the order it's sort of set up and
however the multi-threading is where
some of these processors really
differentiate each other from each other
so the 8150 gets pretty much destroyed
in the single threaded test falling by
about two about half of the score of the
3770 with the max overclocked on it
however due to its eight cores it does
sort of make up some ground and falls
pretty in-between the 2500 K and the
3570 K which is appropriate given its
price point ah the new generation Ivy
Bridge processors beat their last
generation Sandy Bridge equivalents by
about ten percent so this is pretty much
to be expected and then you can see here
that the Sandy Bridge core which is the
same as on sandy bridge-e the six core
3930k scores about the same in the
single thread however just sort of
stomps all over everything when it comes
to
multithreading because this is six
course 12 threads you have to do some
serious overclocking that is about 4.6
gigahertz on Ivybridge in order to get
it to catch up to sandy bridge-e in a
multi-threaded tests like the Cinebench
test for battlefield 3 guys remember
this is a custom run-through so the
results might not have the same kind of
consistency but I believe them to be
well real world accurate so battlefield
3 seems to care about multi-threading
you can see here our 3930k performs
extremely well even running with the big
dog in this test which is the 3770k at
its maximum overclock and remember a
3930k is good for at least you know a
reasonable overclock to four point mid
gigahertz as well so there's more
performance to be squeezed out of it now
unlike some CPU reviews I've gone with
realistic settings 1080p high details so
that's why you're not seeing much
difference in terms of the performance
of these processors let's face it
they're all pretty close everything here
uses Sandy Bridge everything here uses
Ivy Bridge and this is the lone AMD CPU
in the test so you can see the fx-8150
doesn't do that well but everything else
is pretty close when it comes to the max
FPS with the 3770k max OC winning and
everything else here is pretty similar
when it comes to the minimum FPS as well
dicing max because I meant average so
the red bar is average and the blue bar
is the minimum so this is all sort of
within margin of error and this is the
one that's really lagging behind in this
case if you want to see those numbers a
little bit better there you go running
with my usual which are two settings you
can see again there's not much
separation here in terms of performance
with the exception of the 39:36 3930k
which shows its prowess again with its
multi cornice as well as the 3770k being
the clear winner again and the 8150
being the lesser performing part out of
all of the parts in this particular test
i'm using yeah my usual settings I think
I already said that now it should be
noted that while I am using realistic
settings for the games I'm using maybe a
bit of an unrealistic configuration
these are dual
79 70s overclocked at 1.07 5 gigahertz 8
gigs of RAM MSI z77 AGD 65 bored i used
an msi x79 something-or-other DD 65 for
LGA 2011 and then I used a crosshair 5
formula for the AMD test bench I'm using
an SSD for my boot drive Patriot
wildfire and that's pretty much it let's
get into the Skyrim results so Skyrim as
you can see doesn't really like the 8150
very much and really benefits from
better IPC and higher clock speeds as
you can see here more than it benefits
from multiple cores so the clear winner
in this guy is the 3770k due to its
overall faster than the other stuff Ness
so guys actually I changed my mind about
the quick sync and Media encoder media
converter 7 results I'm just going to do
a general overview of what special about
Ivy Bridge and we're going to wrap this
one up that's just a performance
overview so Ivy Bridge in general what's
special new 22 nanometer manufacturing
process reasonable overclocking although
it does get pretty toasty you're going
to want something like a Corsair h 100
or nhat to keep it pretty cool if you
want to go over around 4.5 gigahertz
performance wise yes it's better than
Sandy Bridge I don't have a Sandy Bridge
box to represent here it is better than
FX however FX has you know some pretty
aggressive pricing going on and
considering how many cores are included
there's something to be said for that
and oh yeah right other stuff lucid
virtu MVP is supported on the on the
similar timeframe released z77 chipset
you've also got support for overclocking
hyper threading turbo boost as well as
better onboard graphics so the better
onboard graphics not only effects if
you're using onboard graphics but also
effects if you are choosing media
converter 7 and you're using the IGP in
order to convert your media which is
like way i'm not going to spoil it but
it's way way faster than any
other way of doing it especially with
the new Ivy Bridge processors using the
HD 4000 graphics virtue MVP basically is
just a way to use the onboard graphics
to improve performance and games alone
my experience it didn't make that much
of a difference on the spotty
consistency of the results of that
particular technology made it not that
appealing to me
the z77 platform with an Ivy Bridge also
supports PCI Express 3.0 which means
your latest generation 79 hundred series
7800 series and 600 series graphics
cards are going to be able to really
stretch their legs even if you're using
a mainstream platform that only supports
8 X 8 X bandwidth that is equivalent to
pcie 2.0 16 X 16 X so thank you for
