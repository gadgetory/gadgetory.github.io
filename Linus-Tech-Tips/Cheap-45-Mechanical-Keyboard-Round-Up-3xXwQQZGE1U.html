understand you guys the numbers tell me
that y'all really like sheeps and your
comments are giving me a slightly
different version of the story one that
I think I've also figured out you want
to see the cheap stuff that's also the
good stuff so we went looking for the
least expensive keyboard on the market
but one that is still fully mechanical
and without any of that mechanical feel
marketing malarkey either so here we go
then
a roundup of the nine cheapest true
mechanical keyboards on Amazon enjoy
the be quiet dark Bass Pro 900s modular
design supports a variety of different
layouts and configurations click on the
link in the video description to learn
more first up is our audience's favorite
brand
apparently red dragon products have been
flying off the shelves like fire since
our last peripheral roundup available
here this is the red dragon k5 51 vara
the product page says it is built like a
tank and actually we're inclined to
agree
its splash proof and the exposed steel
backplate is sturdy
not to mention heavy a s it's got double
shot injection key caps with a gaymer e
but very readable legend over top of
what they describe is cherry green
equivalent switches but they both look
and feel a lot more like blues if you
ask me with that in mind then the typing
experience is pretty good but the key
caps are a little on the slippery side
and keystrokes produce a metallic twang
that like country music you'll either
love or hate the back light has a
generous 10 steps of brightness
including off but unfortunately only one
affect breathing though an RGB version
is available and there's an unlit one as
well in case you want to save two
dollars all las Demon King is a 10
keyless with according to the Box its
own branded owl on mechanical blue
switches but it turns out that they're
actually just gather on blues and the
diagram on their website is a ripoff of
razors marketing materials for their
razor green switches produced by kail
anywho the keyboard itself is nice and
heavy but with more dec flex than other
keyboards in our roundup and typing is
overall ok due in large part to the
laser engraved key caps whose width and
raised corners are debatably fine but
whose key cap wobble is
not the dual-purpose keys have the
symbols beside each other rather than
fact
so the backlit version that we're
assuming exists can illuminate both but
on ours it's just kind of hard to read
or funny
my favorite keys are the five percent
key and the one on that subject there's
also an indicator light for an unlock
even though there's no number pad it's a
decent board overall if you don't mind
the annoyingly narrow Enter key since it
uses the European isolate rather than
the North American and fee the next
keyboard on our list isn't a mechanical
key port at all it's the air fox k-500
Irina captal OVA named after a Russian
actress for some reason we're actually
including this one just to highlight how
easy it is for people with little
experience with mechanical keyboards to
order the wrong thing this one is in
Amazon's
mechanical keyboard category even though
it uses phaser key switches for what
it's worth though she feels a little
cheap but she types pretty nice if
you're into low profile switches if
Apple made a mechanical keyboard aimed
at gamers with a rainbow LED scheme at
okay it's not very Apple II at all but
the 10 keyless z77 from element is
actually pretty sweet anyway it's Otello
blue switches are a little louder than
cherry MX blues but otherwise they offer
a very similar tactile experience and
they also have some extra brackets
around Lacrosse that are supposed to
increase stability but it should be
added you won't be able to add your own
sound dampening no rings the build
quality feels solid and even though the
backlight colors can't be changed on
this version it comes pre-loaded with
nine effects that are easy to control
without the use of software finally I'm
not sure if this is a good sign or not
but they included a few extra key
switches in the Box should the board's
original PC be mounted switches fail so
ugly gray cable aside this one is a
great option
and if you're looking for an even more
compact version of the same try the 545
Graham
element Z 88 super scholar all the
features and keys of the g77 but smarter
with a smaller footprint and bevel is
designed it actually has some other
improvements too like a detachable cord
cable management tracks and multiple
backlight color choices but what if you
want bigger and not smaller then there's
the hey wait a tick no this one isn't
for me element actually it says it's an
eagle tech kg 0 1 1 and yet it has a
similar finish and the exact same legend
as the last two boards and that's the
same legend that the red dragon keyboard
was using - ok so budget keyboard part
sourcing seems to be a little inbred but
regardless this one is also a nice board
with an icy blue backlight that can be
set to breathing mode and a corsair
inspired metal backplate not to mention
that like the others mentioned
switchable WASD and arrow keys are
included in case you wear out one of the
sets and now then for something
completely different this thing is
called the ki-sun or magic force smart
one depending on where you look it's our
smallest keyboard with just 68 keys and
weighing a mere 528 grams the blasted
finish of the back plate belies its low
price tag and it's even available with
switches from Cherry Katerine or Okubo
for different fields what they all have
in common though is that the function
and number keys which have been combined
and a removable cord and media on-the-go
adapter are all included to make it a
very portable keyboard you might even
consider taking this one to class since
ours uses the quiet Otomo black linear
switches these have a similar feel to
Cherry MX
heads the ones that are so common in
gaming boards but quite a lot heavier
okay now this 10g actually is from
element though it has a different legend
different key caps and even different
stems the screws on this weird
compartment on the bottom made us think
that they might have put weights inside
like a high-end gaming mouse but no all
1220 grams of this puppy seemed to be
from the thick steel backplate it's got
a bunch of lighting modes even though
the backlight color can't be changed and
if you're into that sort of thing it's
probably our loudest keyboard in this
roundup overall not bad and it's the
only one with an included wrist rest but
with that said we couldn't find anyone
whose wrists or even palms actually
touched it the dreadful grammar grammar
rate or caliber whatever it is is a lone
wolf in many respects it's the only
board in our roundup that uses brown
switches offering a happy medium between
typing and gaming and apparently it
helps you use every spell correctly
which okay it's also the only one with a
braided cable embedded numpad and the
ability to set up five of your own
lighting schemes though the included
effects are a fair bit cooler as for the
cons the otherwise nice backlit double
shot key caps have additional pad
printing on the outside that looks
blurry and cheap the casing is creaky
and the caps lock key is illuminated
when caps lock is off rather than on for
some reason overall though we really
liked its feel features and compact
layout now then to hand out the trophies
the magic force definitely put a spell
on me
it's sturdy yet light and is available
with a wide variety of different configs
various key switches key counts and even
back lights if you're looking for
something big heavy and gamer II though
we ended up recommending red dragon
again and I also personally thought that
the e element z77
was
pretty well-rounded with that said
though the big surprise here is that
none of these boards stands out as bad
your mileage may vary though because at
the low end of the market you don't get
the same quality assurance program that
you would from a major brand so at these
prices there's the argument to be made
that you could just pick up another one
