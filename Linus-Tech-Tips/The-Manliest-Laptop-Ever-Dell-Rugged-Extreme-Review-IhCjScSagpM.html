you're welcome
there's Alex get a Canadian soil all
over the keyboard can't do that with the
MacBook and here's David doing bicep
curl
there's Alex editing spreadsheets in the
shower that's what I call peak
efficiency there's David crying openly
to the iron giant and here's Alex
throwing it in the back of his truck
there's David he's gonna fight off a
bear at night oh yeah but what has Dell
had to give up so at the latitude 74 20
for rugged extreme can handle those
extreme conditions and who is this beast
actually for is your wallet full of
pointless stuff like hotel room keys and
spent gift cards little Ridge wallet can
change those habits and when you use
offer code Linus you can save 10% off
with free worldwide shipping at the link
below
I feel like this goes without saying but
the build quality of the Dell Latitude
rugged extreme 74 24 is beyond
exceptional like when I say there's no
flex in the chassis I don't mean there's
like no flex when you just touch around
the keyboard I mean you could literally
stand on this thing and it's not going
to care but although I appreciate the
armour the rugged extreme is still a
shockingly thick machine with around 60
millimetres of girth it's not just thick
but it's like three times thicker than a
thick laptop but like that thickness
isn't here for nothing since the rugged
extreme sports one of the most
impressive assortments of IO I've ever
seen which might be kind of surprising
given that you can't even see any of it
right now
this is because one of the rugged
extreme ski features is an ip65 rating
against dust and pressurized water so
every USB port or headphone jack
represents a potential ingress point to
combat this Dell has locked all of these
ports away so accessing is a little
different than your average laptop so
what nyet standard is 2 USB 3 type-a
ports standard headphone jack USB C and
power from here you have some options
for i/o based on exactly what your knees
are our spec has HDMI Ethernet redundant
Ethernet serial and a full size
DisplayPort and although that's quite a
bit over on the right side is where
things get really weird so over here we
have another USB type-a a SD card reader
and a SIM slot a blu-ray player a
freaking swappable PCI storage Bay and a
smart card reader which can be used for
identification and validation of who is
using the rugged extreme the rugged
extreme also comes with a certification
for a large swath of tests like IEC
ingress testing environmental testing
and hazardous location testing this
means it's rated to do a whole number of
really silly things like the operational
15,000 feet an extreme cold down to
negative 29 degrees Celsius it will
shake off 40 degrees shock and won't
cause an explosion if you're using it
around flammable gas which is pretty
great if you're using it on oil platform
along with a bunch of other things along
on this four-page document as far as
performance goes the rugged extreme is
no slouch but
it also won't blow you away walking a
quad-core intel i7
8650 you and an AMD rx 544 graphics it
won't be playing the latest games at
full details but if you have a moment
while out on the field it can run
eSports titles reasonably well and aside
from games the system feels very snappy
overall and should be plenty powerful
for doing things like running medium
sized MATLAB simulations or editing
smaller cat assemblies my favorite stat
though is the battery capacity with 250
watt hour batteries you get the exact
maximum amount allowed on a plane but
even if that isn't enough they're both
hot swappable so you can easily just pop
it out and pop another one right back in
if you're running low and far from a
plug like we are right now but one thing
well all of those components you'll be
creating a fair bit of heat and since
the whole thing's waterproof how the
heck did they dissipate all that well if
you remove the bottom panel which
actually is made of magnesium and not
the plastic I originally thought it was
we can see that the heat pipes go from
the GPU and CPU and storage kind of like
you'd expect and then through a sealed
wall with the heatsink and fan on the
other side allowing the heat to get out
without letting any water or dust in
while we're in here we get a glimpse at
the rugged extremes above-average
upgradability with easy access to two
RAM slots and external access to the
batteries and storage if you happen to
actually break it though it does come
with Dells pro support Plus which gives
you talk priority and even mission
critical for our parts and labor
response although it does say that
varies on regions so they probably won't
airdrop you an SSD in the middle of the
desert but like in downtown Seattle they
probably like bike it to you or
something now the display doesn't have
the best color reproduction ever I
certainly wouldn't use it for photo or
video editing but overall it's still
pretty good
it has exceptional brightness for use
outdoors awesome viewing angles and will
more than do the job when you're out on
the job
the rugged extreme also supports a touch
display and pen support which is
conveniently located on the side of the
laptop and it's pretty easily the worst
touchscreen I've used for years but
that's not without reason most
touchscreens nowadays use capacitive
technology which uses the fact that your
fingers are a bit conductive to
determine where exactly you've touched
on the screen
the rugged extreme however uses a
resistive touchscreen which works based
on pressure being applied to the display
and also just makes it way worse to use
with your finger but it also still works
when you're wearing gloves and have
water or dirt all over your hands so it
fits the laptop the touchpad also makes
use of resistive technology and feels
like it's fresh out of 2006 but once
again it has the benefits of gloved
operation and honestly after I used to
for like a day I stopped noticing just
how mediocre it was so I guess it just
comes with the territory of something
this rugged what isn't mediocre though
is the keyboard it doesn't quite have a
precise tactile appeal that other
keyboards have like it does have a
rubber seal underneath it to keep water
and dust out but overall the typing
experience is still excellent at this
point I'd give it a solid a but
surprisingly it has RGB so I'll bump it
up to an A+ as for the high double
webcam it isn't the greatest I've ever
experienced but I really appreciate the
inclusion of Windows hello facial
recognition and the fingerprint reader
both nice-to-haves
but is the Dell Latitude 7420 for rugged
extreme really about nice to haves like
would I recommend this to the average
person no not at all it's like $4,500
and it's an absolute bear to use but if
you're working around flammable gases
not blowing up is way more important
than Alcantara wrist rest if you're
doing research in the Arctic your
computer turning on is a lot more
important than a 4k display and if
you're wading through a bog in the
jungle I would take water resistance
above a 2080
so if those are the kind of things you
get up to the rugged extreme is going to
be an awesome travel companion
audiobooks can be the perfect sidekick
for any number of summer activities like
hiking sunbathing on the beach running
road tripping kayaking I meet so many
phones are waterproof knowledge you can
take audio books with you anywhere and
