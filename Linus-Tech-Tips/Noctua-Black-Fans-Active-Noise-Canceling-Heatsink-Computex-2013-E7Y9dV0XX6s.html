2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is Corsair
Vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCI XCOM now we talk about not to a
products a lot but they don't really
release that many new products all at
once for the most part but we've got
Jacob here from narc to tell us about a
whole bunch of crazy stuff that's going
on in their boots so why don't you tell
us about these yellow fans first
yes it's with pleasure first of all the
yellow color is just because they are
CNC mock-up prototypes they will have to
normal knock to a color when they're
ready they are new additions to our a
series fans we had 114 92 slim 60 and 40
in the past and these are going to be 20
centimeter 92 millimeter with 25
millimeter thickness and 80 millimeter
they will have all the features of the a
series you already know like flow
accelerations channels or SSO two
bearings awesome so basically we're
getting updates to a couple sizes that
we haven't really seen before and that
what we're gonna do for an update yes
exactly
now speaking of usual Noctua color
schemes whoa what is this
these are black fans targeted for
industrial customers they are made from
fiberglass reinforced polyamide which is
even more rigid than the fiberglass
reinforced pvt we normally use they will
also come with IP clasp 52 water and
dust protection and the new six pole
motor design so why do we need a six
pole motor design what's the difference
between this and the four pole here the
improvements of the six pole motor
design added it offers even smoother
running even lower vibrations and even
lower power consumption alright let's
move on the heat sinks how did I manage
to miss this project Redux this is
exclusive if I don't get the exclusive
thing I'm not even doing my job Jacob
white what's Project redux yeah this is
for all the people who ever wanted to
knock to a fan but felt it's just too
expensive or will take some of our most
popular models like the NFS 12 beer or
NFP 14 streamlined the packaging and
make them available at quite a bit more
affordable prices very cool now being a
design and engineering company first and
foremost and a marketing company second
most Noctua just calls this prototype
d-type cpu coup
but what's cool about this is it stays
out of the know zones for your CPU
socket it stays away from high-profile
memory heat sinks and it also gives you
the same cooling surface area and
performance as something that previously
took up a lot more space by simply using
their new 92 millimeter fan design right
down the middle so this will be coming
at some undisclosed date because right
now it doesn't even have a name yet
moving right along they've improved
compatibility for their low profile
coolers you check this out so they
basically cut away a little piece here
on the side that allows for things like
this high capacitors that are next to
the PCI Express slot so you can use
these easily in either an AMD or Intel
Mini ITX configuration now Haswell kicks
out a fair bit of heat so they're also
adding a higher performance ITX cooling
solution that is still low profile
enough that it sits easily next to a
half-height PCI Express graphics card
and doesn't interfere with your full
height ddr3 memory modules it also is
designed to stay out of the way of your
four pin connector as well as your SATA
connectors the last thing that we have
to show here is the fact that this is
not new at all this is the original knob
to a CPU cooler the you 12 or something
like that doesn't matter what it's
called anymore you can't buy one but it
still has well compatible with updated
mounting hardware and you can still get
a free mounting kit if you are not too a
customer and you provide proof of
purchase now Jacob I ran through all
that really quickly because honestly
this is going to be the star of the show
right here tell me what this guy is
because it's like check this out this
goes back to my NHD 14 unboxing where I
held it up and I'm like it's the size of
my head this is the size of my head
again yeah it's actually an update long
expected and awaited update to our
popular NHD 14 we've working really hard
to further improve performance and the
way we did it is that we expanded the
width to 150 millimeter to fit the new
nfa 15 fan and at the same time we've
also increased spacing between the
heatpipes
and so we've now got a better heat
distribution over larger surface area
and this allowed us to really provide a
nice additional performance boost
compared to the original D 14 now the
original D 14 had some compatibility
issues from time to time with high
profile memory and this of being even
wider how do you address that yes we've
had we have these little cutouts here
and if you drop the front fan you
connect
install RAM modules with up to 70
millimeter height so if you're willing
to sacrifice a tiny bit of performance
this cooler gives you actually more
flexibility as far as high ram heat
spreaders are concerned than the
original NHD 14 so here's a look at the
the cutout so those cutouts are on both
sides meaning you can flip it around you
don't have to worry too much about oh I
put it on the wrong way so ya don't
worry too much about that ah when
there's RAM on both sides sorry I was
holding the microphone there so if you
have RAM on both sides then you'll be
able to have clearance on either side
now let's move into the space-age stuff
that totally doesn't exist yet now my
understanding is not to I had to take
possession of one of the largest
Austrian diamond mines in order to
create this new technology tell me what
the devil makes this so much more
special than what we've already seen as
base plates for CPU heatsinks I'm going
to try and show them that sparkle there
what makes this base unique is that it
has a copper diamond composite insert so
inside the copper base we have an insert
made from a composite material that
features a thermal conductivity of 500
watts per meter Kelvin which is roughly
25 percent more than pure copper okay so
why why are we doing this already what
does it do well the benefit of is it is
as we show in this these simulation
outputs here is that we get a better
heat distribution across the base so we
get more heat to the outer heat pipes
and kind of make a work when we can make
them work more efficiently the reason
why we haven't been doing anything like
that so far is that the hot pressing
technology needed to make this type of
material is brand-new and it's very
expensive so I cannot really say whether
we will actually make it to the market
with this one yet now if you make a base
out of powder how is that going to even
be held together first of all it's
pressed together by hot pressing so it
forms a solid material but we also need
the copper like wrapped around it to
make it really solid and to allow us to
nickel plate it and so low the heat
pipes to it like we usually do there you
go guys performance isn't always about
looks as Noctua has proven to us time
and time again but this my friends if
you've hung in with us this long is the
voodoo magic that's going on a fan
if active noise cancellation technology
so why don't you first explain what is
ANC the basic principle behind a and C
is that you use one sound wave to Ken's
loud another sound wave by overlapping
so this will be a zero decibel CPU
cooler well in theory yes in practice
unfortunately that's not possible the
main reason for this is that the way
fans emit noise is just so complex they
produce your rotating pressure fields
and in order to do active noise
cancellation on that you have to exactly
match these rotating pressure fields so
how do you even get close what are you
guys doing to make a fan make noise and
make anti noise at the same time well
the brilliant thing about the road to
sub technology that we're using is that
we actually employ the fan impeller to
create the anti noise signal now the way
this works is that we have a coil inside
the fan frame and a magnet sitting
inside the blade tips and when we switch
on the coil we can pull down the blade
tips just ever so slightly and when we
switch off the coil again they go back
up so does this create additional
vibration when the fans spinning that
can be transmitted to your case no it
doesn't because most of the fan
vibrations unless the fan is broken
comes from the blades passing over the
struts and these are act exactly the
pressure fluctuations we're cancelling
out with the active noise control as
well so there's gonna be products at
some point maybe you know it'll be a
while in the future but this fan what's
the challenge building a radiator fan
that uses this active noise cancellation
technology the challenge you're facing
with radiator fans is that they are just
so many types of different radiators
different frame grills etc basically the
controller we're working with and the
logic working inside the controller is
designed to be self adaptive and self
learning but we're still seeing better
results when we can somewhat control the
environment all right now show us what
controls the environment better than an
entire self-contained NOC to a cooler
that uses this technology and tell us
about this cooler yes in this case we
have the fan sitting in between the fin
stacks it's a similar design as the
popular NHD 14 and in this case we know
exactly at the distance between the fan
and the fin stacks and what will occur
when the fan will hit the the air coming
from the
fan will hit the heatsink fins okay show
us your demo here and they're going to
have to rely on this graph but we've
heard it it actually works so there's a
microphone inside the case
this whole thing is tool list so you
actually slide the entire assembly with
the fan in the middle into place after
you've already installed the cooler you
no longer you said you're able to get
pretty similar performance to that
double stack cooler over there with the
shroud and with a single fan instead of
two fans making it lower profile and
check out this that is the microphone
that goes into the action until there's
actual logic built into your CPU cooler
now which is absolutely fantastic so
guys we are going to have Jacob press
the switch and turn the active noise
cancellation on and off and we're going
to direct your attention to this little
graph over here so this is showing
actually here if I if I tap on the back
of the case hold on if I yell them but
there we go you can see my voice right
there if I stop talking
bah-ha
okay so you can see the microphone is
working now go ahead and turn active
noise cancellation on and off I'm gonna
I'm gonna stop talking we're gonna see
if they can figure it out
there's a lot of ambient noise here I
guess I'm sorry but you guys are going
to have to kind of take my word for it
what it does is it eliminates that that
noise it doesn't make the fan completely
silent but you know how you often talk
about different characteristics of fans
where a decibel meter doesn't
necessarily tell the whole story because
it just tells you the sound pressure it
doesn't tell you if it's a low hum or
whether it's an annoying kind of noise
like that so this it works and it's
extremely exciting when can we buy one
well that's still a lot of challenges we
face in manufacturing because it's a
vital importance to get everything lined
up very precisely because the risk with
this kind of technology is that if
you're just off by 0.1 or 0.2 millimeter
if the sound waves don't overlap exactly
as you want you will end up creating
more noise than you originally have so
we have to make sure that everything is
just super precise in manufacturing and
I think if I think if everything goes
very smoothly we could have a product
ready on the market in spring 2014 or
maybe for next Computex wonderful so
guys thank you so much to Jacob for
