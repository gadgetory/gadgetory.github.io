this is reka from XFX she showed up for
our first Markham grand opening sale so
they've got a whole booth here set up
for Excel bags I've got video cards and
and boxes free video cards and all kinds
of product wishes
it's gonna tell us a little bit about
what she does for XFX well the simple
answer is that I am a spud smaller but
that's not really all there is a lot of
what I do I manage the Facebook page and
I make vlogs on YouTube basically I just
I am actually really into games that's
always the first question and I just
basically document my life as a gamer
talk about XFX it's new products and
it's sort of a new concept that you've
never been done before it's never been
done because it took a while for them to
find the one lady PC gamer and all of
the North American continent and then
hire her so I'll get maybe here's a
question that I can ask you do you know
any other female PC gamers that you
fragment you know I don't necessarily
have a lot of I know a lot of females
again but whether or not their tastes
and games line up with my own
kasa however I do have a good friend
who's very into like RPGs fun
I know a girl who's obsessed with Call
of Duty but she's next
you know
papers
and then and also like just how I got to
God would accept things we saw there was
a contest and during the contest there
were six finalists when I met
really cool girls who are all into
gaming we all got to have arguments over
what games were the best so they're
looking is the best oh you know right
now I'm loving Starcraft 2 even though
it's not loving me back okay bit of a
learning curve there did you play
Starcraft one I did not you did not well
there's yeah
I think everyone goes through one of
those phases I actually had about a
three-month stint with world of warcraft
back when it launched it was just
terrifying I basically like kind of went
okay here's my credit card
take it away from me I'm not buying this
game anymore and I've been clean for
several years now from wow addiction so
camera man's only to get something I
have no idea what he's talking about I
think he's pointing at the table he's
gonna show us something about the table
I think they're giving away some video
cards here today XFX is a Radeon video
card manufacturer up until recently they
they did not have ATI cards but they
have since throughout their lifetime
rather double lifetime warranty and
martyr friendly warranty over to the red
camp so that means that with an XFX card
like a fifty nine seventy 5770 any of
their full line of ETI Radeon cards you
can not only replace the stock cooler
that is take all the screws out take it
apart put something else on make it make
it more quiet put a water block on it
whatever you want to do you can also put
the cooler back on resell that card
to someone later and they still have a
lifetime warranty on the card so that's
one of the really unique things about
XFX that they bring to the table for
their customers because it really does
improve the resale value of your card if
you can sell it to the guy with a
warranty so that's pretty cool and I
for coming El Tri grand opening I hope
it's been as exciting for you as it has
been for us and say hi to my YouTube
audience of about 25,000
why is the camera looking at me I don't
think anyone's interested in me at this
point
so Rica had a couple more things to add
here sorry I cut it off a little early
last time it's okay all right go to
Facebook just search for an XFX girl on
that page you will see the links to my
YouTube videos and my Steam account name
so you can look me up on Steam if you
want a game with me steam or quake live
it's a good place to find me so XFX girl
on Facebook I'm there and now we're
actually done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
