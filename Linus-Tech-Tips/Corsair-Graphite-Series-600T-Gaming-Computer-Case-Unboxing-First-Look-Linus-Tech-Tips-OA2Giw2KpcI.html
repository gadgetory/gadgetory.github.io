obsidian but it's still pretty cool
because you can actually put it in
pencils and write with it and apparently
you can also brand a Corsair case with
graphite so this is the graphite series
600 T from Corsair I've received yes I
know you know what I'm about to say but
I'm going to say it anyway I have
received endless requests to unbox and
do a first look video of this case I
actually should have had one sooner but
it looks like it got lost in the mail or
something something terrible happened
and I didn't have one until now but I
finally do and we are going to run it
through the paces so I am doing the
unboxing portion of the video now where
I unbox and then we will proceed in just
a moment with looking at the case and
doing the first look part of the video
now I've actually seen one in person
already so I cheated a little bit so not
quite be my first look but it might be
your first look and it will certainly be
my first hands-on so first let's have a
look at the box itself you can see that
course are actually conveniently labels
all of the features that they want to
talk about on this case here so you've
got dual 200 millimeter fans provided
that is one on the top and one in the
front by the look of things we've got
easily accessible dust filters and oh
they make maintenance simple and
hassle-free okay that's terrific we've
got actually here cameramen if you want
to look at the picture and then I'll
kind of read them out we've got
quick-release side panels just like the
800 deal though it looks like a
different mechanism we have an
integrated fan controller that allows
you to adjust for other performance or
silence for tool-free optical bays and
up to six SSD ready hard drive trays CPU
backplate cutout allows you to take out
your CPU cooler or install a new one
without actually removing the
motherboard which is brilliant as well
as the brilliant cable routing system
which just like the 800 D is really
almost the most critical part of case
design after aesthetics and
my opinion because it's such an
important part of aesthetics adjustable
drive cages room for long power supplies
and eight expansion slots giving you
room even for those new
XL ATX motherboards from the likes of
gigabyte cameraman is giving me a hard
time about how long we've been doing an
unboxing without finishing opening the
box as you can see it comes in wow just
like 2 inch thick foam all around the
entire case so this thing will make it
to you and it will not be destroyed when
it's way I have failed at unboxing it is
upside down that's okay I can flip it
over okay so I'm just gonna do now there
we are here it is in all of its glory
the Corsair graphite 600 T so let's do
our exterior impressions first so
cameraman if you want to come in and
have a look at the front you can see the
entire front of the case is a dust
filter mesh finish so that means that
you're going to have excellent airflow
coming from the front of the case you've
got your for optical base here in the
top and then down here you can clearly
see there is a cooling fan installed
behind this mesh and we'll have a closer
look at that once we open it up on the
top of the case we've got four USB 2.0
ports as well as that fan controller not
that they were talking about on the
outside of the box a headphone port
microphone port USB 3.0 superspeed port
as well as firewire and then finally a
hard drive LED there's a power switch
here a reset switch here they both have
satisfying clicks to them and then we've
bought yes more cooling more mesh
Corsair is serious about the cooling
it's a gaming oriented company so it
makes sense that this case is going to
be geared towards gamers move around to
the back of the case you can see the
side panels aren't quite clear this is
not a windowed case although as we're
about to find out just because there's
no window doesn't mean you can't have a
nice interior we've got a 120 millimeter
cooling fan which would be perfect for
an age 50 or H 70 we've got room for our
IO shield
we have eight PCI expansion slots two
little water cooling grommets as well as
room to install a standard ATX power
supply case we will find nothing out of
the ordinary and I guess we might as
well have a quick look at the bottom you
see I'm having trouble twisting it
around it's because it has these great
rubber feet on the bottom that are going
to keep it from sliding off your desk or
having any other kinds of ah
difficulties with the case see they're
very good I can put all my weight on it
not that I weighed a lot although we did
just have Thanksgiving up here so I had
a lot of Turkey
side panel you can see right here
there's not a whole lot of flex to it
you expect a little bit but Corsair
really doesn't skimp on the materials
and you can see the way that there latch
works is quite robust a lot of the time
you look at these tool free mechanisms
and you just go yep that's going to
break this does not look like that is
going to be the case so we'll take off
that side panel take off the other side
panel so we can get a really clear look
at what we're dealing with here and
let's have a look at the inside so we
find zip tied to the inside or rather
twist tied to the inside an instruction
manual as well as some accessories so
cameraman can sort of take you on a
video silent video tour the inside of
the case while I look at the accessories
and decide which ones are noteworthy
enough to talk about alright I'm done
cameraman come back okay we have keys so
this is to lock the side panel of the
case so that thieves cannot steal your
stuff excellent at least I think so then
we have some black zip ties for managing
your cables they include probably about
enough to do a typical build then we
have motherboard screws as well as other
screws that you will need fan screws and
then some rubber grommets okay let's
have a look at the interior so here we
go this is become sort of Corsairs
trademark thing these silicone rubbery
dramedy things so you install your power
supply here and then basically these
allow you to route cables wherever you
could possibly want them to go so you
take them right out here or through this
cutout here you bring out your 24 pin
here you bring out your 8 pin up here
you bring
your your optical drive connectors way
up here so it means that you never have
to see cables running anywhere all you
see is that the cable goes in this and
then it comes out exactly where it needs
to be and they've included ample space
on the back of the motherboard tray and
this one drives me nuts when
manufacturers do this when they create
cable routing options and then there
isn't actually really enough space on
the back to route the cable like you
look there's quite a bit of space there
so if you're running a 24 pin cable
you're actually going to be able to
close your panel I've seen cases that
have room to route a 24 pin cable on the
back and you can't close the panel once
you've actually got it back here
they've also bought a couple little
loops where you can install zip ties
here here and here so you can use those
to make sure that the cables stay down
flat when you're running them up the
back of the case here are the connectors
for all of your internal so all of your
front panel connectors you can see
they're all sleeved in black and there's
a lot of them I already covered what's
up there so I don't really need to tell
you too much more about that the front
panel fan controller is here and we're
about to find out because I have no idea
to be perfectly honest with you how many
fans it can control and the answer is
four so there's two included fans here
another one here and then it looks like
you can open another one here so by
default no that's power so by default
you can control the three included fans
and then one additional one with the fan
control or not and then this looks like
power for the fan controller knob itself
okay so here we have six three and a
half inch hard drive installation trays
I'm going to go ahead and pull one of
those out from the other side and I
think I'm actually going to turn the
case around because we've seen
everything that we need to see from that
side I turn the case around I mean turn
cameraman around because that's sort of
more effective now you can see these
have a bit of a flimsy look to them but
I've seen these before as soon as you
install a hard drive in them they firm
right up you slide them in boom your
hard drives installed it's completely
tool-less and you see how they Diggle
now once the hard drives in there they
will not move they're actually a very
ingenious design and I really really
like them here at the front we have that
one 200 millimeter fan and then up in
the top we have an oh i'm sorry hold on
yeah and then we have another 200
millimeter fan up in the top you can see
it has a good number of blades on it and
it is quite nice looking although you do
not have to use those fans it looks like
we've got mounting holes for potentially
a variety of other sizes of fans for the
top so that's pretty cool too
there's the 120 millimeter fan that I
showed you from the back and here's a
little design by Corsair logo so you can
actually see that is right below the
cameraman that is right below the CPU
cutout so that's quite a large CPU
cutout no matter where your socket is
located you will be able to remove the
backplate and remove the CPU cooler
without any hassle here is our tool free
five and a quarter inch pay device
installation and removal gadgets okay
that's I think what they're called on
the Corsair sheet although probably not
so you pull that out you pull your drive
out you push that in after you put it in
and that installs your drive is as
simple and you can actually put in a
screw from the other side if that's not
quite secure enough or if you're going
to ship the system or anything like that
I think that pretty much covers
everything I wanted to say about the 600
t thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look and don't forget to
subscribe to - tech tips cameraman and I
found a few more things off-camera first
of all this is removable so you can
reach the fan in the front you can clean
the dust filter which is part of this
little panel with the Corsair branding
on it there's also a removable dust
filter in the bottom which I showed you
before but didn't really talk about so
you can take that out just like the 800
D you can remove that clean it all that
good stuff and then this whole panel is
actually removable as well you just
click down on it
and then you can use the key that I
talked about but I couldn't find the
keyhole for to lock the the side panel
or to unlock it so that is all I wanted
to say about the 600 T</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
