before PAX Prime to check out a new
product launch they've been whispering
about for a really long time so we went
to their audio testing and development
facility in kamas I hope I'm saying that
correctly to check it out that audio
project was called the Artemis spectrum
both the G 633 and the G 933
so I'll get into the exact specs and the
differences between these two headsets
in a moment but first off let's start
with the cool stuff the rnd so the first
area we'll check out is mechanical
engineering this is where a lot of the
hard like carving out of the actual
physical project happened literally
carving out they did foam models here
that had C and C and 3d printing and
foam work and tons of different stuff
this is where they conceptualized the
general look the general fit and the
general feel of the headset they did
things like testing the thermal
performance the noise isolation
performance and the comfort of different
foams that will go on the inside of the
top band on the headset or even just the
ear cups they did things like switching
from a circular styled switching to a
square styled switching because
apparently it's ever so slightly better
for acoustic performance their 3d
printers here were sick their floor
based 3d printers not like desktop based
3d printers like mine back at the office
and the quality of these things was just
absolutely insane we felt we saw a few
models that they made both in headphone
style and in just other random fun
projects that the engineers we're trying
to make and it was pretty damn cool next
up there was two electrical engineering
rooms the first one was focused on the
development research and testing of
their new Logitech pro G 40 millimeter
patent-pending driver that's going into
both of these headsets
the first station that they had was a
clippo machine that would shoot a laser
at the driver and then they play noises
through it and see if it distorted in
any improper ways and they had some
material development where they changed
them to all the diaphragm and stuff to
optimize for those inaccuracies that may
or may not have been there around the
corner there was a super badass anechoic
chamber which was huge on its own
foundation and then on two hundred
springs so that even if a slightly heavy
truck drove by it wouldn't even feel it
which is pretty freakin cool in that
chamber they had a chest up dummy which
would then wear the headphones this
dummy had mechanical ears meaning that I
had microphones in each of its fake
freakishly realistic ears so that they
could test leakage of noise out of the
headphones and leakage of noise in to
the headphones and then optimize for
that another
it's the next electrical engineering
room was focused around power delivery
and antenna design now antenna design
for the wireless headset which is the G
933 but I'll get more into that later on
and power delivery for both of them the
antenna design was interesting they do
things like put a microwave with a
certain amount of water in it and then
turn it on so they could test how much
that would interfere with the headset
because that's an important thing this
headset is transmitting over 2.4
gigahertz the reason why it's doing that
is because jumping up to five would
actually shorten the range and that's
not a good thing it would also take more
power and when you're dealing with a
wireless headset long lasting power is
important so they stuck with 2.4 and
even though it's a noisy band they've
done some improvements like antenna
design and they've upgraded the chip for
that which is cool they've upgraded the
rating for how far the distance on these
things can go to 15 meters over previous
models but to be honest I was using it
at like 24 and it was still stable so
they've done a pretty good job they also
tested just to make sure that no matter
how you were facing or how you were
positioned the signal would still be
strong and they did this by using a big
box and then a mechanical arm inside the
box connected to a head that was wearing
the headphones so that it could rotate
it around and then make sure that the
signal was solid no matter how that
little mechanical head was positioned
the last Rd base room and arguably the
coolest one was compliance the idea here
is testing interference so they're
testing interference of radiation radio
waves
EMI shock power from the mains of your
house all of this kind of stuff the
headset both has to not output too much
of this stuff in order to not interfere
with other things and it has to be able
to withstand a certain amount of
interference with other things without
screwing up so it has to be able to take
a certain amount of radiation and it has
to not put out too much radiation and
for instance if it gets an electrical
shock it should keep working because
that's very commonly going to happen if
someone's walking on a carpet then picks
up their headphones you might shoot a
static shock at it and it should be able
to last there's regulations all around
the world for this like FCC you guys are
probably familiar with that and yeah
very cool room now for the juice of the
video the headphone specs the odor of a
spectrum project currently is comprised
of two headsets the JC
6:33 and the G 933 both of them feature
that new Pro G 40-millimeter driver that
I mentioned earlier
both of them have 16.8 million RGB color
custom lighting which is pretty sick
both of them have customizable side
plates although we only saw one of them
for now
both of them have G key macro buttons on
the side multi-platform support for like
console or the better option PC
both of them have DTS and Dolby
technologies inside which are switchable
in the driver the core differences
between these two headsets is that the G
633 is wired and can mix two signals
while the G 933 is Wireless and can mix
from three signals now this whole mixing
business might sound a little weird but
it's not actually that complicated
there's two or three inputs depending on
what headset you get the G 633 has two
it has USB and 3.5 milimeter the G 933
has three USB 3.5 millimeter and
Wireless and you're able to use all of
these inputs at the same time so you
could mix in like your TV and your
computer or say a record player in your
computer or a record player or your
computer and your phone so you can order
pizza without dropping out of your match
it's interesting I don't know how many
people will use it but I think the
people that do use it will appreciate it
a lot
then there's the Logitech Gaming
software if you're familiar with modern
Logitech products you probably know
what's going on here but there's G key
macro settings lighting settings for
different modes and whatnot there's your
EQ settings so you can set all of these
things up for game profiles so right
when you load that game it'll switch
into that mode so your lighting effects
we can cut kick in your G key macros can
kick in your EQ settings can kick in and
you can have it switch on either DTS or
Dolby so if that game comes with one of
those technologies you can make it load
up with that or for you guys who don't
want any of those technologies running
I'm sure you're definitely out there you
just turn them off plain and simple so
that ladies and gentlemen concludes our
tour time for the conclusion the problem
here is that it's really difficult to
test audio products on the road I don't
have my reference audio I don't have my
reference headphones and I'm in a
foreign environment for example they had
us test against Sennheiser
HD 650s I believe which is great that's
a good test they should have done that
that's awesome the problem was we were
in a room with a whole bunch of people
talking and open headphones on one side
and closed headphones on the other it
wasn't a fair comparison but it's a good
comparison nonetheless just I can't give
a proper review while I'm on the road
what I will say however is I came into
this expecting low grade gaming
headphones because low grade and gaming
headphones kind of go together usually
and I was pleasantly surprised in terms
of features comfort and audio quality
and that's all I'll say for now alright
