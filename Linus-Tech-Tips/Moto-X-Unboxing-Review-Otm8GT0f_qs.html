learn more let me start this off by
saying I'm not a hardcore phone guy so
that's the perspective you're about to
get I spent some time with the Moto X I
really liked it here are my thoughts on
it but if you want the more hardcore
perspective you know what Marcus
Brownlee has a video about it and his
videos are great go watch that I will do
a brief summary of some of the stuff
everyone else has already told you
however and it starts with its assembled
in America which I guess to me as a
Canadian isn't quite as immediately
relevant but it does represent a very
positive trend that we're seeing not
just with Motorola in this film but
apples even embracing it with the
upcoming Mac Pro it has a customizable
experience which is partly achieved by
that assembly in America so even though
mine is a bone stock you know carbon
fiber you're looking black back and
black buttons you can actually change
around quite a few things for over 200
different combinations it does not
support SD expansion hello Google
influence so there was no getting around
that Google's not a big fan of SD
expansion and we don't find it on the
Moto X which is the first phone that has
really got the Google influence on it
since the acquisition of Motorola quite
some time ago the hardware is it's ok
it's nothing really special so there's
an s4 Pro class processor featuring to
1.7 gigahertz course and a fairly
capable Adreno 320 GPU wireless AC is a
standout feature however and it's
normally not included with this
particular combination
it feels plenty fast out of the box but
in reality what doesn't these days
there's more to it than CPU speed
however page 9 of an ant X excellent
review of this phone gives a great
summary of why fast well-designed
storage is important maybe even more so
than CPU speed to keeping your device
operating in that like new state that
we've all become quite used to now let's
start with the hands on I love the shape
and size I've complained quite a lot if
you watch my weekly live stream the LAN
show or really anything else about the
fact that the HTC One is just a little
bit too big for me well the Moto X has
the same size screen 4.7 inches but be
of the gentle curvature of the back and
the fact that the sides of the bezel are
much smaller I find it much more
comfortable to hold and I can type
one-handed on it very very easily so big
thumbs up for the ergonomics of the Moto
X it does get a little bit toasty on the
backside especially when you're doing
something like using it as a hot spot
but again not worse than something like
the HTC one and while the plastic
backing might not be better for heat
conduction it will make it so that your
hand doesn't get quite as sweaty
I love the position of the lock button
this is another complaint I have about
the one that recessed lock button on the
top or flush lock button that's kind of
hard to reach without slipping the phone
out of your hands no this one's really
easy to reach very very natural the way
that you're normally holding it you can
press it with your thumb or if you're
left-handed you can press it with your
middle finger very very nice however
it's a little bit close to the volume
rocker which is not as much bigger than
the lock button as I would have liked
and is difficult to distinguish the two
from each other when the device is in
your pocket which a lot of the time
let's face it it probably is the other
economic thing that I'm not really a big
fan of is the three-and-a-half
millimeter jack in the middle of the top
particularly when watching videos or
something where I'm holding the phone
like this I did found it kind of got in
the way whereas one that's a little bit
more off to the side is easier to put my
hands around them something that comes
right out of the middle
I found the auto rotate a little bit on
the sluggish side which contrasts with
the one which I find really really
twitchy to the point where it's annoying
I think I'd rather have sluggish then
you know just like ADHD you know you
accidentally tilt the phone a little bit
do you want to go this way you want to
go that way so that's just an
observation not so much a complaint or a
positive thing and the battery life
didn't light my world on fire it was
about like the HTC One with my general
usage although if you want scientific
analysis of the battery life again head
over to that uh non tech review it's
very excellent I'll link it in the video
description
speaking of lighting my world on fire in
batteries those are two things you
probably don't want together when I
plugged the Moto X into a charger it was
like magic it reminds me of my iPhone 4
lightning fast charging the HTC One is
so slow and the galaxy s4 is better to
an extent but the Moto X charges in like
you know 70% 65% as much time
as the HTC and it was refreshing to be
able to grab the device go oh crap I
don't have enough battery I'm on my way
out the door throw it on a charger for
20 minutes and then have that actually
help and have it get you through the
next outing on the screen side of things
it's a bit of a different approach than
well this one again comparing it mostly
to the phone that I have the most
experience with it has an AMOLED screen
and definitely suffers from what I like
to call STD or store television display
syndrome with oversaturated colors it
looks very vibrant to the point where it
almost makes your eyes wanna bleed but
that is a characteristic of AMOLED
screens and a lot of people like it
whites do have a definite yellowish cast
that was noticeable on both webpages
when I'm reading as well as when
watching videos but the flipside of that
is that blacks are amazingly deep you
can hardly see the difference when you
have a black screen up between the bezel
and the screen which combined with the
touch button design makes the front of
the phone seem very very seamless
overall I think I like the
implementation it doesn't take up screen
real estate permanently the way that it
did with old Android tablets I mean
wasn't that infuriating when just the
bottom of your screen was always taken
up even when you were in full screen
video yeah so it doesn't do that it can
reorient itself and never really
glitched out on me it was a bit
disorienting at first when the buttons
disappeared and turned into dots that
were obviously not labeled at that point
but once I memorized the positions of
the buttons it became a non-issue very
very quickly the screen is 720p so we're
getting used to these 1080p smartphones
in this kind of a size range like the s4
and the HTC One but remember guys that
is still what Apple would call retina
class density so I don't have any
complaints and it was not very
noticeable compared to the HTC One
except with very very small text the
main AMOLED advantages that this phone
did get to enjoy was during gaming and
watching videos there's no blur or
smearing amyl LED doesn't have the same
kind of ghosting effects that you'll get
on a lot of LCD displays and it's
extremely power efficient so you can see
right here this notification right now
is only lighting up the pixels that are
needed the rest of them are actually
turned completely off and that also
contributes to those
excellent black levels the viewing angle
is also awesome even compared to Super
LCD 3 which is what's in use over here
but there are some disadvantages the
main one being that over saturation
looks unnatural once you're used to once
you're used to better I mean I guess
really that is the main one other than
that I really do like the screen the
touch interface electronics are visible
to me at a comfortable viewing distance
on plain backgrounds and even during
video playback particularly in cartoons
where you're gonna have a lot of single
color large spaces and you can really
pick out that matrix behind it I wish
that we were past this
Apple's had it right for years and I
wish everyone else would get on board
the last thing about the screen the
backlight flicker weirds me out a little
bit so you can really see especially
when moving it quickly and when there's
only a few pixels lit up on a black
background you can really see the
flickering of the backlight but it's
only really noticeable when you're
moving the phone quickly and so it
stopped bothering me after about the
first day the lowest light setting on
auto is not really suitable for
nighttime use and this is a little bit
ironic to me because usually phone
manufacturers in Auto setting are trying
to preserve battery as much as possible
and crank things down but I found that
for nighttime viewing I actually had to
manually turn it down even further on
the software side this is actually my
first experience with pretty much bone
stock Android and I this isn't gonna be
popular but I don't really know what all
the fuss is about
most of the annoying stuff about
TouchWiz can be worked around and I
quite like HTC Sense there's some stuff
that I just found easier to do
particularly their multitasking
interface is in my mind world's better
than the stock Android multitasking
interface it only shows you nine things
at a time but they're it's much quicker
to switch between them and I generally
only use about nine things at a time so
it's absolutely great for me I did find
switching from one phone to another
extremely easy the Motorola transfer
wizard is completely painless and
handles the whole thing wirelessly it
only takes probably about an hour and a
half it took for me to transfer from the
HTC One to the Moto X I did find that
again so the whole software thing I did
find the update manager pretty
aggressive I'm again not much of a power
user so I just pick up my phone I expect
everything to be where I left it
really want them changing the
functionality around on me that often I
don't necessarily you know need to
update to the latest software like the
minute it gets released and again I know
it's not very popular but their update
manager just basically says look you
have to install this update you can
postpone it but you actually have to
pick a time when we're gonna remind you
again you can't just do it manually at
least that's the default setting there's
probably some way to change it but I
didn't spend enough time with the phone
but it would have bothered me alright so
now on to the whole always listening
thing Google now is great in theory but
the functionality is still quite limited
you can't adjust the volume or do other
things that seem pretty obvious to me
like okay Google now please mute my
phone and it's gonna be like what and
it's been like google it or something
also most of that functionality is
disabled if you have any kind of a
security lock and I do use my phone for
work so it's the kind of thing where I
really wouldn't I wouldn't consider
running a phone without a security lock
on it I'm not a huge fan of the stock
Google keyboard Swift key has treated me
extremely well so that was one of the
first things that I installed on it
my last comment on the hole okay Google
now voice control thing is having voice
control that's constantly listening to
you is the future that is the thing that
really jumped out because it's
incredibly cool to just have your phone
be somewhere else and this is even
beyond being able to use your SmartWatch
to answer your call or or whatever other
things you want to do being able to just
talk at the phone once it can understand
you and has more functionality
regardless of whether it's woken up or
asleep is very very very cool so in
summary I guess it's also a phone voice
quality was good no complaints there no
one on the other end of the line had any
complaints and that pretty much wraps it
up thank you for checking out my sort of
on oh right unboxing okay so here's the
box there's like some documentation I'd
microUSB cable a wall wart and
presumably awesome remover okay my
