access point in my house to replace my
premium consumer wireless router
my wife's immediate reaction was that
she thought I had actually swapped out
her phone for one that looked the same
but was faster so as much fun as it is
for us hardware enthusiasts to blow the
rant on a new graphics card a bunch of
ram or a fancy case I concluded at that
time that we could probably actually get
more value for our money by considering
Wireless upgrades instead of some of
that other stuff it's just too bad that
the unit I showed off last time costs
$1,000 making it attainable only to
folks who are out shopping for water
blocks for their Titan X graphics cards
but today that changes this is the
exclaim x i3 your next wireless access
point
Kingston's kc3 10 business class SSDs
deliver massive capacities firmware
based power loss protection and enough
performance that were powering our
brand-new storage server with them click
right here to learn more so when you
open the box for an x i3 the first thing
you'll see is a gigantic QR code yes
this business grade Wireless solution
wants you to set it up with a mobile
phone what oh and I guess there are also
some accessories in there but I you know
took me a while to figure that out
because my didn't pick my jaw up off the
floor so you get a power over ethernet
injector a $15.00 value some mounting
hardware a little key for removing the
unit from the aforementioned mounting
hardware and an Ethernet cable and then
in most cases I guess probably also the
xi3 indoor access point itself let's
talk about this sucker for a minute
she'll be the hardware actually looks
pretty familiar but I guess it's not
exactly a top-secret that X clean is a
daughter company of ruckus the makers of
the super awesome enterprise-grade
wireless gear that you're most likely to
find at an airport or university versus
at the local Starbucks so let's see
which one of ruckuses models got cut
down a little to make it more price
appropriate and user friendly for Wanda
of Wanda's diner to deploy in her
restaurant
Ross Beck's wise the xi3 looks pretty
darn similar to the ruckus r500 it's got
the same two by two antenna config with
the same power output it can handle the
same and 300 megabits feeds on 2.4
gigahertz and AC 867 on 5 gigahertz and
even the power draw is rated exactly the
same I mean sure the 500 client
advertised capacity has been toned down
to a hundred and along with the other
feature trimming very notably the
removal of beam flex plus ruckuses
proprietary tech for punching through
interference and barriers more easily
there is no compatibility with ruckuses
zone director controllers for local or
remote management of scores of access
points across a large deployment
although apparently a cloud option is
coming soon no exclaimed figures any
more than 10 APs and you're probably
overdoing it and you should
to ruckus so back to managing them then
how are you supposed to do it right the
app it starts with that QR code from
before that basically brings up a how-to
guide then you install the Harmony Forex
clean app password protect the app which
by the way touch ID support on iOS it's
a very nice touch then you go through a
very basic ap setup that pretty much
amounts to creating an SSID or a name
for your network and a passphrase
then you scan for access points on the
network and that was the first stumbling
block for me and one that I think
exclaimed could handle a bit better
both of my units upgraded their own
firmware once connected to the network
with internet access but they didn't
reboot on their own and I had to read a
little error message in the app to
discover that I needed to go manually
hard reset the devices to apply the
firmware upgrade that should happen on
its own with that out of the way though
I got the ap configuration page fired up
and there's basically nothing in there
you can assign one or both of your
radios to the SSIDs you create although
I would recommend manually breaking out
2.4 and 5 gigahertz if you intend to use
this at home so you can manually reserve
the faster 5 gigahertz band for devices
that matter and leave 2.4 gigahertz to
non performance sensitive ones instead
of relying on the ApS band steering to
decide for you and mock up your game
stream performance potentially you can
choose a particular channel and channel
width for each radio or leave it on auto
to let ruckuses channel fly technology
hop around according to whichever has
the least congestion a feature whose
functionality I was surprised to
discover when I cracked open my wife's
by and saw it flopping around like a
Mexican jumping bean in our crowded 2.4
gigahertz environment and one that I'm
not 100% sure how I feel about since not
being on one 6 or 11 is not really a
recommended configuration when you ask
most wireless experts there are a few
other little things you can tune in
there on a per SSID basis you can set
bandwidth limits and you can control
whether or not clients can see the rest
of the wired devices on the network but
that's pretty much it I covered the
whole thing wireless 4 done
which doesn't mean that it sucks it
lacks a central controller so with
multiple ApS clients are left to decide
which one to connect to
but the xi3 delivers great wall and
floor penetration power even on 5
gigahertz new settings from the app are
applied nearly immediately clients
connect almost instantly compared to
that horrendous lag that's typical of
consumer grade gear and range was
absolutely freaking awesome I don't
really know what to say
other than this is really good stuff and
you're getting it for less than a third
of the price if you're willing to give
up some of those ruckus features that if
we're being honest with ourselves we'd
never be dinking around with in the
first place if the bloody Wi-Fi just
worked but it's not perfect either
I think ruckus is getting pulled in a
couple different directions right now
they've got a great idea here making
deploying a great reliable Wi-Fi
solution so easy that any small business
or home user can do it but their users
you know Wi-Fi tech heads who manage
deployments for their customers are
inherently hardcore and asking for
things that Wanda of Wanda's diner will
never understand
so ruckus needs to decide once and for
all what X claim is personally I'm glad
that they caved and added a web-based
management tool even if I only poked
around in it after I'd set everything up
through the app but Wanda actually needs
things simplified even further even if
that means Oh hiding terms like 20
megahertz or client isolation behind
friendly sliders that say I'm in a busy
area with lots of other Wi-Fi or I'm in
an isolated area and want more
performance and it needs like a OneTouch
guest network set up for example that
does everything for Wanda and while
we're at it the navigation of the app
does need some polish too like the
grayed out actions button in the iOS app
that's actually clickable to access some
pretty critical settings or the unclear
difference between the wireless symbol
and the COG from the dashboard which is
called statistics instead of I don't
know dashboard for some
and while we're at it why does the
statistics page contain information
about how many packets have been sent
instead of pretty graphs of use over
time or alert heavy user leaching
bandwidth off the network or something
like that anyone who doesn't care about
packets unless they're ketchup but of
course I don't think any of this stuff
is a deal breaker
not even the odd crash of the app
because I did have it happen if I did
think that I wouldn't have told you this
is your next access point now to be
clear it's not for everyone for a single
or even a couple of wireless clients a
similarly priced consumer device will
deliver higher speeds but the fastest
individual link speed is not the be-all
and end-all of Wi-Fi performance
especially as you start to load up more
clients and I'll take ruckuses ple
deployment making better positioning
much more possible since you're not
reliant on a power jack nearby and
ruckuses ability to not have the
hardware fold like a cheap suit once a
couple of video streams start flying
around over a fancy-looking enclosure
and big strong looking external antennas
speaking of which crunchyroll is the
site created by anime fans for anime
fans they offer the most current
episodes of new shows straight from
