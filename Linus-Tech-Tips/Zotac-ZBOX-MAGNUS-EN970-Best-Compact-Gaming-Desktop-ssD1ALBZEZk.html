system with like a gtx 980 in a mini ITX
case is kind of fashionable right now
but there's a whole other class of
machine that's smaller than what can be
built using off-the-shelf components the
issue is that with these systems you get
less customizability and in some cases
like we experienced with this really
small gigabyte bricks micro pc heat
management can be a real problem if
desktop-class GPUs are integrated into
such a design so ZOTAC is taking a bit
of a middle ground approach with their
new ZBOX Magnus en 970 compact gaming
desktop at only about 20 centimetres
long and wide and about five centimetres
tall it's small but not so small that it
seems like it all melt the minute you
fire up battlefront but does it hold up
I guess we'll find out
if you already know about Luke rate go
sign up for the October crate at the
link in the video description if you
don't stick around till the end of the
video to check out our unboxing of the
September summon crate with items from
Pokemon and hearthstone
so let's start with a look at the
Magnus's specs at the heart of this tiny
PC is an Intel Core i5 5200 u processor
running at 2.2 gigahertz for the turbo
boost speed of up to 2.7 gigahertz for
graphics you get a desktop class nvidia
geforce gtx 960 with 3 gigabytes of
gddr5 vram and well ok you don't get a
whole lot else this is a bare-bones kit
meaning that you get no storage no RAM
and no operating system included but
it's got two two and a half inch SATA 3
6 gigabit per second base and an MDOT 2
slot for RAM you will need laptop style
sodium memory it's got 2 memory slots
with official support for up to 16
gigabytes of RAM although we were able
to install 32 gigs of this fancy-pants
high-density stuff that we got from
intelligent memory a little while back
not the first time we fit tons of ran
into a tiny PC you can check out that
video here now moving on to the outside
the chassis itself has an ID say
unassuming but personally appealing look
that would fit in well either on your
desktop or in your living room as a
console replacement the front panel
features a power button that lights up
in orange when you turn the system on
and you'll also find 2 USB 3 ports
headphone and microphone jacks and an
SDXC reader for high-capacity cards the
back panel has two more USB 3.0 ports as
well as two USB to ports four HDMI
outputs two gigabit ethernet ports an
antenna connector for the built-in
wireless AC Wi-Fi and of course a power
connector for the included 180 watt
power brick while another type of
display output such as DisplayPort would
have been nice to see at least these are
HDMI 2.0 ports meaning that you can get
4k at 60 Hertz as long as you have a
compatible monitor
or television I wouldn't try to game at
that resolution mind you on the GTX 960
anyway but those connections could still
be useful if you wanted to use a box
like this for other less intensive tasks
at high resolution whether it's web
browsing your office work or whatever
the case may be for accessories you get
a screw and Wi-Fi antenna the
aforementioned power brick and drivers
on a CD although since the Magnus
doesn't include an optical drive you'll
either need to dig out an external
optical drive if you want to get into
that CD or you can just use the also
included read-only USB stick thumbs up
for that one installing our R + + SSD
was a breeze the bottom panel comes off
quite easily with a couple of
thumbscrews revealing the two drive bays
and RAM slots our test SSD a Samsung 850
Pro installed with a very simple tool ax
stick mounting system that snapped right
on to the drive from there it was just a
matter of inserting the SSD directly
into the SATA ports and securing it with
another thumb screw it's one of the
easiest SSD installations that I've ever
done and will allow you to get up and
running in a matter of minutes and
remember that these bays also support
two and a half inch mechanical drives if
you're more into that sort of thing
giving you the capability to throw an
end to SSD and then up to two high
capacity hard drives in here so now
let's have a look at some performance
numbers though just to see how capable
the little Magnus is although we were a
little concerned that a desktop gtx 960
would thermal throttle due to being in
such a small case our gaming results
were actually very good we ran three
games at 1080p
starting with Crysis 3 on high settings
with anti-aliasing and motion blur
turned off and the Magnus delivered a
very solid 63 frames per second average
moving on to tomb raider we got 54 FPS
with everything maxed out and FXAA
enabled and finally we achieved 38 FPS
on the witcher 3 on high settings again
with AAA and motion blur off aside from
FPS numbers though we wanted to keep an
eye on our GPS core clock speed to see
if it was throttling in spite of the
solid performance and ZOTAC clearly did
a solid job with his cooling solution
with our GTX
sixty running smooth at ten thirty eight
megahertz during both our crisis three
skybox tear load test as well as a firm
arc stress test at 1080p with MSA a
cranked up and while that clock speed is
about ninety megahertz lower than in
videos reference GTX 960 you can still
expect a solid inconsistent gaming
experience with the Magnus at normal
room temperature and speaking of
temperatures the core i5 5200 you
maintained an average core temperature
of a very reasonable seventy degrees
Celsius throughout the i-264 system
stress test with no thermal throttling
either what's really impressive in
addition to that though is that the
system stayed nearly whisper-quiet
even during our most strenuous tests
with John standing right next to it
during testing and kind of having to get
pretty close in order to hear it even
after turning off the rooms air
conditioning our review unit also scored
good marks for power consumption or
black.there of so even though the
included power brick is rated for 180
watts we didn't come close to hitting
that during testing with idle power
consumption at a mere 21 watts going up
to 34 watts in Ida and 84 watts in fir
Marc and only a hundred watts during the
crisis three load tests I mean seeing as
there are full fledged desktop rigs that
can assume close to that while idle this
is a big plus if you're an eco concerned
individual who's worried about power
draw we also put the system through a
couple synthetic benchmarks to get a
feel for its non-gaming performance it
scored 255 in Cinebench 74 38 and winzip
and okay although these numbers are just
fractions of what you'd expect to get
with a desktop core i5 or Core i7 they
are respectable when you consider that
the i5 5200 U is a low-power part and it
only has two physical cores with four
threads so watch out for that because
while I wouldn't have recommended doing
any kind of heavy rendering or like
super intensive video editing on a
system like this anyway some games don't
cooperate well with two cores or less so
your mileage may vary in terms of the
long-term usability of this system for
Gaming which I guess leads us pretty
well into the conclusion I don't really
have anything negative to say other than
there's a slightly weird pickled
vegetable smell that was kind of
detectable when it was first open but
none of that showed up during a during
testing anyway and I guess okay I guess
if there was something to complain about
cost is a bit of a tough pill to swallow
on this one because $800 is pretty steep
for a bare-bones machine especially when
you compare it to what you could build
in terms of a fully equipped traditional
desktop but if you can stomach the price
the solid 1080p performance the thermal
management and superb acoustics make the
ZBOX Magnus an interesting choice for
anyone who wants a bigger than it looks
gaming experience in a tiny lightweight
package so if you don't know what loot
crate is basically it's up basically
basically it's a monthly subscription
