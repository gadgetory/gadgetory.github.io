thing about taking time off it's off of
work but it's actually more tiring yeah
so my body has kind of a like a rhythm I
guess you could call it like a schedule
yeah
where the instant that I am out of the
office like off work I get sick
yes yeah yep yeah I get absolutely the
exact same thing so so we were we we the
Linus media group team anyway sorry bro
get rekt the Linus media group team had
Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday so we actually had six days
continuously not in the office most of
us some one person opted to stay in and
hold down the fort which actually ended
up being really helpful some massive
shadow to Alex P anyway but anyway
within two days of those six I was like
sick as a dog the fourth day I basically
spent the morning in bed and then I'm
recovered enough to come to work today
because that's just the way my body
handles things it's like well you don't
have to work so surely you have nothing
better to do than to just like recover
or something the problem with that
theory is that we had all kinds of
things to do so over the six days I
spent two of them watching my my two
kids two cousins look so we had five
children in our house six and under five
two of the days I was on a staycation
which sounds great when it's just you
and your Esso but is more complicated
when you have three children and you
also intend to go up to grouse mountain
and go sledding and stuff you know with
a 6-4 and two-year-old yeah
I had three Christmas dinners so
there was my wife's family and then my
family and then my other more different
fragmented part of my family my family
is like pretty cool and then like I'm
sure there's other stuff I was I was I
was supposed to get together with you
last night you were supposed to just
like bro out yeah but apparently your
Christmas time off was aside from not
being off just sort of generally
horrible to - yeah we've had a lot of
health issues in the family so you're
good right yes I don't have the sickness
thing this time which probably because I
kept working cool it's the same kind of
thing we're when I go to a show if I get
sick I'll get sick the day after the
show will be sick for the weekend and
then we'll be totally okay to go back to
work my body's like it's okay we're
gonna flush all this out Saturday Sunday
we're good Monday you're good to go no
problem oh man I ate something weird
last night and like didn't agree with my
body at all but I was like I don't think
I'm actually sick and then by the time I
woke up I was like yeah I don't fine
yeah was it Turkey it was actually
chicken it's a bad Turkey but it was it
wasn't it wasn't like salmonella bad
chicken it it was just like I don't know
I just didn't like it for some reason
interesting yeah all right
so we've got a great show for you guys
today presumably I haven't looked at the
dock it's great every time also I just
got logged out of my Google account I
hate how that happened I was just
looking at this dock it always happens
mid-show anyways RTX 2060 is apparently
gonna have six variants Wow
just in case we needed a little bit more
confusion there Chinese schools are
enforcing their kids to wear smart
uniforms which is that's that's talked
about that for a while there's an iOS
update that disables cellular service on
the 10 R and 10's obviously that's not
on purpose and I need some help this is
super cool what do you mean he needs me
oh yeah no do that one yeah I need some
help um I built a DIY battery out of
16:50 sells and I'm a little bit stuck
on why it is bottoming out at what is it
three point that's about three point
nine one volts per cell in my RC car so
I was hoping that you guys might be able
to help me with that
could it be explained by one of the
cells not being in I don't think so
because I've already know what we'll
talk about in more detail
so it was weird
it was collect the weirdest injury tell
you what happened okay so I was playing
badminton and I didn't do anything in
particular like I was just moving or
something like it wasn't like on a like
a dive shot like I've hurt myself pretty
badly
diving for shots or like doing whatever
but it was just a totally normal thing
but I was playing sick but not like
really sick not like coughing or
anything like that like I just could
have had kind of fatigue and I felt weak
like you ever have Devvarman
kind of like wake up and you're not
feeling well with our jerk days I'm like
your whole body's just like yeah you you
would go to crush like an aluminum can
and you're like wouldn't be able to do
it like just your muscles are weak and
like it's just kind of weird like you
just feel slow and things like kind of
hurt yeah
so I fuckin like that and it felt like
what happened was I just like the
muscles weren't strong enough to hold
everything together and it just kind of
like popped funny and I've got kind of a
history of joint issues particularly
with my knees and so it's been a little
disconcerting that it's taken this long
to heal because that was over a month
ago but it is continuing to get better
and the answer seems to be even though
it hurts when I like when I go hard on
it like with my with my right leg I can
go all the way down and lift all the way
up no problem with my left like that's
really really hard I was actually gonna
say you probably need to do quad
exercise and it hurt a little bit but
the thing is that the more I keep just
like doing my normal things that I do
like taking stairs two at a time I
always take stairs two at a time and
just like all the normal little things
that I do you know stretching I see blah
blah blah blah blah every morning I wake
up it feels a little bit better and a
little bit stronger you know there's
this like meme going around kind of yeah
I think I think it's not really a thing
right now actually but it was like
you're you're like a better person if
you take stairs two at a time so it's
funny that you brought that up I always
take stairs to the time it was like it
was like a thing for a little while but
anyways yeah no I I he's more of an
efficiency
that's that's a big part of the point
and like how it's bit more it builds
muscle more and stuff but okay I had any
problems for a long time working on quad
something for me especially you brought
up the like it doesn't feel like the
muscles are strong enough to keep
everything together yeah Nisei voices in
your quads okay I can I have this book
so baby it was a leg injury it might be
Oh interesting
what there's been nobody ever trained in
any of this stuff I have no idea but I
have a book from a doctor who's into
this stuff called the supple leopard and
it's also like keeping yourself prepared
for physical activity and preventing
problems and all this kind of stuff
interesting and it's like big and kind
of a textbook thingy but it talks about
all the different parts of your body and
that's where I got a lot of stuff for
fixing my knees and it was successful so
maybe I can lend you that book or
something alright well you have to be
after the book of short stories by Roald
Dahl that my sister gave me for
Christmas
oh okay I actually I'm not sure if I'm
gonna read them you know I read through
a lot of his stuff with my kids and some
of it is utter horse crap oh like it is
not not all of his books are very good
James and the Giant Peach is a stupid
book and you know that's been an
experience that I've had going back and
reading these children's stories with my
kids Stuart Little is trash is hot
garbage
why do you white had one good book in
him because Charlotte's Web is a
masterpiece
yeah but Stuart little it's just about
nothing there is there's just this rat
that like is in this family for some
reason and he does some stuff and then
it's over nobody learns anything nobody
develops there's no real explanation
given for why the hell is he there what
are we trying to accomplish like you
just he's in like a Bose Bo trader race
or something and it's got like all these
nautical terms in it I'm like I'm
reading this out to my kids and I'm
going you guys have any idea what's
going on they're like yeah I think it's
a boat race and I'm like yeah me too and
it's like really detailed and stuff and
I'm kind of sitting there going like no
this is good why is this a children's
classic I I mean maybe they're just
worried
maybe books weren't as good back I
remember Stewart little at all at least
maybe that's part of the poverty it's
terrible it's the one about the mouse
that no it's like it's funny because
their last name is little and he's
little I guess okay all right sure
I don't know sounds good our people
upset people are upset but you don't
like Stewart little they're upset I'm
not surprised little not surprised
because that's that's something they
would have been attached to from when
they were kids which is something people
are very defensive well like he Mouse I
know it doesn't matter I was using a
denigrating term for him okay because I
think he's a little poo head
I think he's useless um like welcome to
Harry Potter no no no no no no Harry
Potter holds up very well hey the movies
who earlier movies a little rough the
third one's fine
but there was a really awkward period in
cinema in the early 2000s yeah when CGI
was good enough for people to want to
play with it all the time
and to be cool but not good enough to be
convincing it was a bad bad time
honestly early two-thousands was cut
okay so I had never seen a Mission
Impossible though okay have you ever
seen a mission of mine yeah yeah but not
recently okay so I was like I want to
see the Mission Impossible movies so I
watched missing at Mission Impossible 1
having actually seen a few episodes of
the classic show but a long time ago so
I was like familiar with the base
covering technology and that the message
will explode or whatever we used to have
on our we had satellite TV and we used
to have like this old timey channel that
had all these old shows so and you know
the funny thing about it is that with
the way that the programming stacked up
on some of the the channels that had new
stuff that you wanted to watch like
Comedy Central or whatever else we had
American satellite TV was awesome with
the way that the programming would stack
up if you wanted to watch during an off
time this like classic shows channel
was one of the best ones because it has
primetime crap from the last 4050 years
yeah yeah um so it would have like I
Love Lucy which is actually a great show
holds up very well at least when I was a
teenager I had so I had like I Love Lucy
had what's that really good one with
Archie Bunker Edith bunker all in the
family all my family like just like
these older shows and and it they would
so they would show Mission Impossible
from time to time anyway the point is I
watched the first one really enjoyed it
a little bit unconventional you know
there were some things that were a
little bit hard to follow along with but
I was like okay cool
this sets me up well to watch the next
one the next one was terrible I couldn't
even believe it I was halfway through
the movie no I think it was 45 minutes
in and I was I turned to my wife I was
like hey so I guess like the plots
starting now so that's cool maybe we're
gonna go somewhere from here tussin it's
like it's everything that was bad about
an 80s action flick except it was made
in like 2001 I think that's why people
liked it though it reminded them of the
older so here's the thing sometimes that
can work um damn it possible - let's
find out what year that was
mm okay so here's the thing it was
actually the biggest commercial success
of the series in spite of getting panned
by critics yeah although people say that
at the time people were quite a bit more
forgiving um and in spite of just just
you know it's it's awful and I okay
maybe there were things about it that
were a little bit more groundbreaking at
the time but I mean it was directed by
was this the one where they have the
fake faces Mission Impossible is that
yeah it was directed by John Woo okay
you don't know who John Woo is okay here
hold on a sec you yeah he does of course
he does who doesn't know John John Woo
no okay did you ever see face off no but
I've seen parts of it
okay whatever the point is lots of doves
flying around lots of slow motion that
doesn't really make a ton of sense lots
of like flying kicks through the air so
like a very acrobatic yes sort of plot
is less important than style approach he
mostly does Asian films I haven't seen
any of this yeah no no no you wouldn't
have you wouldn't have heard of most of
this stuff like there's okay he's worked
with chow yun-fat a bunch anyway the
point is it the movie seems to be more
about Tom Cruise's hair and how
majestically it flows in the wind okay
and less about any kind of advancement
of plot okay spoiler alert not that I'm
saying anyone should watch this movie
anyway
so spoiler alert here comes the plot
there's some MacGuffin that sure is bad
yep and there was a guy trying to
transport aforementioned MacGuffin
in his bloodstream it's a diseased
MacGuffin okay okay so he's like okay so
the plane he's on gets hijacked he dies
they steal the MacGuffin but oh no it
turns out they only got half of it so
stuff was actually happening at the
beginning but none of this is really
explained because with the
aforementioned face covering malarkey
yes it seems like Tom Cruise is actually
the guy stealing the MacGuffin up until
he rips off the face we have no idea who
this guy is that guy is and he just kind
of takes off you're like okay but like
stuffs happening okay so all that
happens like the first five minutes over
the entire rest of the movie literally
all that happens is they wait am I
getting the am I getting the third one
and the second one confused now what the
hell does happen in the second one right
okay so he convinces the guys X to help
him seduce the guy who like has it and
then she gets in with him but then he
figures out she's working with Tom
Cruise and then ultimately he captures
her and she
takes the MacGuffin which she has now
for some reason during a firefight
injects it into herself and then there's
like this weird car chase and then Tom
Cruise and the bad guy literally joust
with motorcycles leap off their
motorcycles collide in the air nice and
then fist fight to the death nice and
then they get the Cure from him because
he had the cure but not the disease and
then they cure her that is two hours of
cinema and Tom Cruise's hair is just
wonderful the whole time yes like one
point his stylist must have had the
hairspray no no I'm not hairspray
because it was too it was too beautiful
for hairspray yeah but something I don't
know what product they were using in his
hair but if they could bottle that and
sell it that should have been a maenad
like product placement to the whole film
just like Don Harden he had a comb no he
had a comb he was like right out of
thing the entire time guarantee yeah
yeah um should have been the first
person on the credits list I don't
remember what I was talking about anyway
so the third movie is been directed by
what's-his-face Star Trek and Star Wars
JJ Abrams yeah Thank You JJ Abrams so I
forget what I was going with this but
these three movies have the least in
common like thematically like they own
the style that I had ever seen in any
sequels at all they just have nothing to
do with each other
so the first one is kind of like a spy
thriller there's almost no violence okay
the second one is just like people
punching each other endlessly and
wonderful hair and then and wonderful
hair and then the third one plays kind
of like your your bog-standard modern
action flick like it's it's it's it's
sort of well shot like artfully shot but
it doesn't try one said where did Luke
get his shirt oh that's funny well we
should come back to this I'm glad you
asked
well I just thought that was really good
time
or not timing but it's a really good
question on LTT store.com that is one of
the newest designs
it's called constantly constellations
it's not even expensive and if this guy
not bad
where is it and surely you could also
wear it yeah and it looks really cool
and like neutral so it doesn't look like
you're super shilling for a brand but
there's a little LTT on the back and
it's hard to see on me but if you zoom
in on him you can you can see an LTT so
it was very subtle like connected stars
thing going on this guy barely looks
like he can get out of bed in the
morning like look at him if we zoom in
on his pupils he's probably high no yeah
we saw eyes
I think the first one I did was this one
so I think this is the one that's the
worst cuz they're still the most dilated
oh yeah that's amazing that's not the
point I'm kind of done talking about
Mission Impossible anyway I don't really
remember it but you didn't get to the so
the first one's not very spy based
someone's action and great hair yeah
what's the third one
the third one is just like a modern like
it could just as easily be a bond or
Jason Bourne movie okay it's just like
so it's very yes okay but not that much
lens flare like I didn't know one thing
that I will say that they did is not
high a much better job of in the third
one and this is something that I think
is really hard for movies and gentleman
in general so we're actually getting a
kind of into an on topic discussion oh I
knew we were gonna get there we've made
it how to handle having high tech in
your films without it immediately dating
it three years later when someone goes
to watch it and they go oh that's silly
so the first Mission Impossible has this
great scene where they're talking about
like you know if I'm gonna be involved
I'm gonna need all the great hardware
you know I want those prototype laptops
with the 686 s and I went holy crap this
was made at the time when the 386 her
486 was the top of the line and everyone
just figured Intel was gonna keep
calling them
number 86 like whoa so technically they
had laptops with unreleased processors
yeah never got released yeah maybe never
got made but they also were never
released and that was something that the
third one did a much better job of
because satellites were and will
continue to be a thing that tracks
locations and can get imaging more stuff
but it'll still be a settling but like
it'll still be a satellite um whereas
like the kind of the kind of hacking
that you see in older sort of tech
centric movies drives me just oh okay
but have you seen hackers I actually
still haven't you keep telling me to
watch it it's so good because it's so
bad but they like know that it's so bad
and they just run with it and that I can
appreciate
when they try to play it off is like
this is hardcore and totally real uh
yeah yeah but when they like we're going
through the data and you're basically
like flying in a ship through a city of
like columns of floating text and
they're like where's the file if they
have to like find it and they're like oh
man that that I like that of that is
fantastic when they're like Kay showing
real hacking is super boring so we're
just gonna make it very obvious if this
isn't real and have fun with it that's
cool
speaking of movies that had fun with it
I finally saw already play right for
Gibson okay
haven't seen it what do you think you
still haven't seen it no I read the book
a long time ago but I haven't seen oh
okay there were some obvious flaws okay
I've actually heard very mixed reviews
so I mentioned there were very obvious
flaws like they they had a lot of fun
with the the idea of people in VR
looking like complete idiots in real
life okay do you care about spoilers no
cuz I've read the book okay cool
so during and guys I'll be pretty vague
with this so during some kind of
situation where a lot of people are
charging in one direction okay you
probably know
yeah but pointed I there's there's a
cutaway where they show the real world
and everyone's in the real
wearing their headsets charging down the
street right yeah but okay yep so they
conveniently ignore that and there's so
there's one part where someone gets like
hit by something this is very early on
someone gets hit by something and that
zeros out their account or whatever and
they fall backwards off their couch in
the real world and it kind of goes okay
but what about the preceding five
minutes when they were leaping around
that wouldn't have worked in this living
room so they like they took artistic
liberties they had fun yeah the aspects
of the concept that were convenient when
it was convenient and just ignored it
otherwise see that's probably fine but
it seemed self-aware enough to me that I
was okay with it yeah they also they I
think that something that some people
whether they like to admit it to
themselves or not probably did not
appreciate about it is that it did poke
fun at gamers okay in a pretty if you
are if you are even remotely capable of
reading the subtext of a book or you
know an email or a movie you're like
you're pretty aware of it like the
badass guy that's like the enforcer and
this is again this is very early on the
actual person I'm assuming the actual
person has like kind of a chronic neck
thing and like so is probably not in
great health
but like lives in this escapist you know
dream world where he's like the keeper
of the mighty artifacts or whatever yeah
and so it's got kind of a it's got a
scent of you know the South Park World
of Warcraft guy okay about it yeah and
the whole movie does okay things I liked
they casted just normal people which I
thought was really cool the love
interest is a like moderately attractive
normal chick and the guy the the hero is
like
I actually can't tell if he's moderately
attractive I have kind of a hard time
yeah with that she's not repugnant like
I can I can tell that her guys seems to
usually be like you're kind of fine yeah
I can tell as far as I could tell he was
just like a pretty normal dude
apparently she's supposed to be
apparently she's supposed to be like
super unattractive in the book so very
quickly yeah
the best they could manage for that was
she has a birthmark on her face which is
interesting so my daughter has a
birthmark on her face which if that's
sort of the Hollywood standard for
really ugly I guess sort of has a bit of
a personal personal meaning to me
apparently the lead was the oh sorry one
second no worries okay
apparently the lead is about as
attractive as me so that's a shame wait
no that's okay okay all right um anyway
so so I I forget where I was going with
this so I turned my brain off and had
fun for okay two hours okay
but I can do that with movies but like I
kind of went into it with really high
expectations because the book is really
famous technology enthusiasts and gamers
we don't really get a lot of movies
people are upping you now there's like
they're upping me what's up mean why
this is attractive um yeah it's finite I
don't care I'm married already like the
yoke and harness or whatever is already
on both of us for better for worse yeah
um so so right we don't get a lot of
movies so we got like that Tron movie
there was that Warcraft movie
you mean nerds gamers nerds in game yeah
yeah yeah yeah we don't get many good
ones too because that's
yeah a lot a lot of movies made around
what is happening guys are you pranking
us
oh that's the notification okay okay I'm
so confusing a lot of movies based
around games just end up being super
horrible often times not often - yeah
have you heard of put that one director
you ball yes yes I think he's made a lot
of movies based on games yeah right
so that's like a problem and if we could
stop doing that that would be great but
like yeah a lot of them are garbage okay
so we've got people in chat that are
making arguments for good ones wreck-it
Ralph was fantastic I haven't seen the
second one yet yeah that's any good yeah
but then I'll watch almost any animated
movie from DreamWorks or Pixar and
probably enjoy it
um there was another one here that I
thought was really important to bring up
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
okay Alex Jay hasty over on floatplane
says we get Marvel movies no we get a
Marvel movie they're all the same movie
and I really like them I watch them ok
for one yes but Marvel Marvel movies if
we're talking about see there's a little
bit of a mix between movies for nerds
and movies for gamers but also I would
like to add in there Marvel movies are
very borderline for nerds yeah kind of
for everyone there they're action movies
yeah like there's there's narrow also
for nerds for sure but like there and am
I am I missing the boat here or they're
not actually a ton of inside jokes I've
yeah I've seen some reference and stuff
I'm not super deep into comics there are
a few superheroes that I know like
probably a disproportionate amount about
check but not a ton and yeah I don't see
a huge amount of them there's some
references like I know in the Deadpool
movie that's that's one that I know
probably a little bit more than average
about I know yes an average of but most
of them I did notice a few things for
sure yeah but they're usually handed to
you right yeah it's not even really a
reference it's just like this is
something in the universe hello here it
is very clearly so J on or however I
pronounce this as Marvel movies are for
nerds kind of like the Big Bang Theory
is for nerds in that nerds will get the
joke and they'll know the characters but
like it's more of a mainstream
entertainment product that was sort of
built on a thing that was traditionally
for nerds I think that's a bit of an
extreme example because I know a lot of
nerds that don't like Big Bang Theory
and I don't know a lot of nerds that are
like Marvel movies are too mainstream
and stuff I know a lot of nerds that are
like Marvel movies are all exactly the
same and really boring no Big Bang
Theory though has the issue where it
kind of crosses the line into offending
nerds a fair bit that's what I'm that's
what I'm kind of trying to say but it's
it's for nerds in the sense that like I
get all the jokes yeah yeah yeah but
then like so does my mom Silicon Valley
is awesome yes Silicon Valley is awesome
I actually haven't seen anything since
what's-his-face behaved like an idiot
and got kicked off the show I sat in an
Austin Evans house and watch like the
first two seasons but other than that I
haven't seen any of it I've only seen
the first two seasons okay so you know
what we should really do our sponsors
for the show yeah as much as I'm having
fun talking about absolutely no tech
news we're gonna sponsors and then maybe
we'll do some topics sure and I am
having this teriyaki premium beef savage
jerky jerky made with the best
ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives with a goal to create a
snack that is full of flavor and spice
that isn't bad for you I know Alliance
and I especially like their barbecue
sauce the barbecue sauce is really nice
barbecue sauces anything Moho is good
the maple buffalo bacon
what hey Colton can you
me Colten golden we need more maple
buffalo bacon yep
we need more maple buffalo big yeah mo
jalapenos my favorite one
but they're all like legitimately really
good there's 13 different flavors which
include sriracha bacon maple buffalo
bacon and other ones that we've
mentioned the Carolina Reaper which we
don't have but we have the ghost pepper
one uses one of their hottest peppers in
the world and this weekend only that's
the hot sauce by the way this weekend
only if you buy three or more bags of
jerky and use offer code holiday swag it
chosen all caps here some I'm not sure
do know all caps just in case you can
receive a free swag bag and a sample bag
of Moho for free honest at sample jerky
dot-com or savage Jericho sorry -
definitely savage jerky dot-com not
sample jerky BIA mm-hmm okay he's pretty
cool and stuff I used it yesterday
because I was trying to book flights and
I was turn it while I was booking
flights they upped the cost by a hundred
dollars and I was like were you able
yeah either way uh no actually really it
didn't work that time do you have
experience of it working in that
scenario yeah but I think the reason why
the cost went up wasn't my own searches
it was that I tried to buy the thing so
many times I was trying to buy it on
Expedia and it failed on checkout six or
seven times and then it went up by a
hundred dollars and then later on it
worked so that is known in the biz as a
new purchase elf own cell phone yep you
self-owned oh yeah kind of but it's
there no cell phone but it's their site
not working that was the problem so I'm
kind of kind of cheesed about that do
you clear your cache yeah yeah yeah yeah
it was all I did all the things that
work I think is because sample jerky
dot-com is this own now hold on just a
minute here
it's available no way
sample jerky dot-com yeah that won't be
there long no whatever you do do not go
there
oh goodness yeah it's gonna be a bad
scene I guarantee it or someone's just
gonna buy it like link it to the forum
or something that seems to happen for
you yeah sometimes we get white nights
sometimes we get less white nights yes
we did already talked about it yeah also
the Ltd store guys you should check out
my cool shirts like this one yeah check
out our dank new merch we also have
cable ties and all that kind of good
stuff
yeah um Oh John John oh says yes I am
working on getting you more maple bacon
thank you very nice please get a big box
this time yeah you should remind users
to move their floatplane subs from the
forum to floatplane site wow it's really
interesting that you brought that up
thank you that's fine
I'm just gonna read it no I know you
didn't someone in the flow plane chat
was being very helpful and reminding me
so yeah we are not going to be doing
floatplanes subscriptions through the
forum there has been some questions
about this if you are a bronze silver or
gold subscriber you're fine you have
your own little loophole you don't have
to do anything everything's okay just
relax you're good if you are subscribed
there are some steps that you need to go
through those steps will be in the
description of the video on YouTube and
you can also find them if you just go to
the forum and go to the like lmg
official section or whatever it's
actually called anything cell ng LTTE
official section and then there's a
pinned post called full plate
subscriptions and migrating to full
plate comm there's a step-by-step
process it goes through everything you
need to do if you are a yearly
subscriber there is also a step where
you need to give us an email but you
need to do all the steps before that
which include canceling your subscribe
subscription on the forum
and there's instructions on how to do
that creating or signing in to your flow
plan calm account subscribing to
whatever creators you want to support
and just watching cool stuff because you
you just paid to do that if you are a
yearly subscriber you also need to send
us an email because then we'll grant you
whatever roughly whatever amount of
remaining months you had left on your
yearly and on January 31st if you are
currently subscribed on January 31st you
are getting free two months this is to
help this is to give people a little
gift for dealing with the annoyances of
needing to cancel and re-subscribe
somewhere else and it's to cover
whatever amount of little bit of
subscriptions someone on a monthly might
have or for yearly subscribers who don't
currently have a yearly optional open
com unfortunately it will be coming very
soon but it's not there yet
so that's to try to like make that a
little bit nicer of a transition because
your these subscriptions right now it's
up to the creators but the only one that
had one was limas media group and the
way that they did it was you were
basically paying for ten months instead
of twelve so the two months gap you know
see how that works it makes up for that
for now so in the end you're benefiting
regardless of what situation you're in
you're not losing anything we had a
bunch of emails how people being like
does this mean I lose the month's unread
nope nope nope nope you're being totally
taken care of everyone will be gaining
free subscription time so yeah it's all
good so check out that link and move
your subscription over to flow playing
comm because we will be killing all
current subscriptions as and we will not
be allowing them to renew as of December
30th or 31st around there depending on
what time zone you're in so yeah check
it out do it up send us an email we have
been getting a lot more emails than we
suspected so you might not get responded
to absolutely immediately but Joe and I
are on it
pretty hardcore so you should get a
response fairly quickly and yeah there
you go
so the r-tx 2060 is rumored to be coming
this comes from video cards calm look
we're doing an actual tech topic hey
someone already bought sample jerky
don't comment I see that this looks like
it's going to be just about the most
confusing card to ever
whoa and this is an old world where
what's it called that stupid one that am
be just in the RX 580 2048 SP or
whatever the one that's basically a 2070
overclock yeah this isn't a world where
that exists so the r-tx 2060 not to be
confused with the rumored GTX 1160 both
of which will occupy that mid-price tier
is rumored to be available with six four
or three gigs of memory and it can be
either DDR 60 ddr5 for either them so
gigabyte according to an entry in the
Eurasian Economic Commission is
preparing 40 r-tx
2060 graphics cards because you gotta
remember cuz you got your windows and
your ARS and you got your gaming and you
got your like whatever other series and
this is just gigabyte remember EVGA
they're the kings of taking every card
they have for the win plus oh yeah OC s
Oh super oh no C 0 C plus for the weight
kingpin edition uh so this is ridiculous
this all this does like we have been
railing against confusing naming schemes
for a very long time over here oh my god
all this does is create consumer
confusion like there's a few here that
we need Mini ITX sure do we really need
a GD dr6 and gddr5 version of that is it
possible that gigabyte is just covering
all their bases here because I know that
what we would see sometimes is
particularly might be there might be
like Oh like PC part picker whatever
always recommends like one of these
types so they don't want to get left out
of that type mm-hmm so they're just
gonna be every type so we're gonna build
a PC subreddit or the building
suggestion build
planning yeah - actives for them all
these guys are gonna kind of like glom
on to a type-o it's the best value if
you get like this much RAM in this type
of ramp so they should buy that kind
they can create the skews now and then
just focus on whatever is working later
yeah so they might not end up making a
ton of each one yeah but I think I think
they'll shift Manufacturing's or
whatever one becomes a major thing this
is insane though like that's this skew
mess around this is gonna be nuts and if
you're not super into computers this is
gonna be a big problem
the other issue here is that one of my
problems with manufacturers calling
different products pretty much the same
thing because they're all r-tx 20/60 all
they had to do was make the GDD our six
ones twenty-six ETI or something salmon
jerky redirects to savage jerky guy that
bought it is a cool dude that's fine and
sample jerky calm redirects to savagery
you don't know that's hilarious
thank you very much so all they had to
do was call that one a TI or something
yeah and then they can go okay now it
has either three four or six gigs of RAM
but it's GI people can't get - I know
yes see guys not that bad see guys okay
it's been around for a while people are
used to titanium yeah it's pretty cool
it's hard yeah good titanium it's hard
yeah yeah yep but this all this does is
make it so that the only way to
differentiate one card from another is
through the manufacturer part number
something that very rarely even ends up
in a product description on a website so
if you're looking for reviews of the
r-tx 2060 you might find a review and
we've seen this strategy you might find
a review of the r-tx 2060 GDD r 6
overclocked thing because that's what
the manufacturer is sample - all the
press and then you might see that and go
well that can't be that different from
the 3 gig gddr5 not overclocked one but
the thing is that we might be looking
even if that performance delta is only
like 10% 12% 15% let's say it's
somewhere in that range you look at how
compressed the stacks of technology
products have become and those are
completely different products
now 10% difference in performance is not
the same product anymore and it's very
frustrating to me that we got the same
name assigned to both of them now to be
clear I don't blame gigabyte for this I
blame no vidya for this yeah 100%
because you please just trying to cover
themselves and be like whichever one of
these goes gangbusters we need to be
ready for it if I was the product
manager at gigabyte I do the same thing
yeah I'd be ready to go with all of it
really frustrated about it but I would
do the same thing I know this is just
yet another example of invidious
arrogance like they just don't give a
crap like the amount of extra headache
and cost that this adds for their
partners to have to support all of these
skews it just doesn't make any sense
because the thing about it is that
you'll get this price sheet and the
manufacturer already knows they already
know which ones are the focus models
just get rid of the other stuff why are
we doing this yeah I don't I gave you so
sorry talking about this a few years ago
so this was pre RGB this is back in like
back when they were doing that weird
gold thing with like that kind of tacky
yellowy gold which is funny because that
got like really hot shortly after it
anyway and I was like I was telling them
look you guys sell like three boards
okay in the mainstream lineup let's say
leaving out orangey
you've got your - a or like your your
blank one so your P whatever chipset
name D a or just with nothing yeah you
got that one then you've got your
whatever Pro which is usually that one
with like a couple features like raid
support or something like that then
you've got your deluxe which is your
Cadillac board everything else and
there's obviously you need a micro ATX
phone or whatever but all the other ATX
boards and there would be like nine in
the lineup would sell drips and drabs
and those three are moving the vast
majority of the volume and I was like
look wouldn't it be a better idea at
this point because this was at a time
when NZXT was starting to take off as a
case manufacturer and they were like
offering like all these colors in their
cases wouldn't you be better off just
taking like the two boards that sell the
vast majority
of your volume the pro and the regular
and just doing like four different
colors of them at this point I mean
people are buying motherboards more
based on fashion decisions already and
this was exactly five six seven years
ago yeah people are buying motherboards
more based on fashion decisions than
based on performance and features anyway
because there's no differentiating left
anymore so why not just give the people
what they want give them a bunch of
color options because back then if you
wanted blue and black you bought MSI if
you wanted green and black you bought
gigabyte DF I was dead already so there
was no orange and black or yellow and
black and then a Seuss was generally
like kind of that weird well this was
the gold era but before that it was like
that weird powder blue and then they had
white and then they also had black I
mean everyone kind of like moved past
that cuz they're like yeah we'll just
RGB illuminate everything and then it's
not really a problem but ah yeah I I
kind of agree with a lot of that I'll do
it at the end and like wasn't one of the
problems with this too is is like I kind
of understood for a while when they had
skew differentials between RGB and non
RGB because you could legitimately save
some money having non RGB options and
there's quite a few people I don't think
it's I actually can't even tell I don't
necessarily think it's the majority
right now but I think there's a fair
amount of people that don't really care
yeah and would rather not pay for it
there's that subset I know it exists I
don't think it's not if I yeah yeah but
like I understand those skews as well so
like do you have those differentiators
for these you already have like 40
that's gonna be a really hard thing to
push now it's gonna be really hard
especially because unless you have like
a reasonably deep understanding of PCB
design you're not gonna be able to tell
the difference between a Strix and rog
and gaming and whatever else so it's all
just kind of sold on these sort of weird
features like ultra durable
whatever that means yeah yeah and like I
I honestly think Nvidia is attacking
their own base here because this is
gonna make buying an nvidia product
really really confusing buying an AMD
product not
not confusing and buying a console the
most understandable thing there is I'm
not even like I know I know I'm sorry
but like actually a big part of the
reason why people don't like buying
computers is like I just want to play a
freaking game cross-platform play is
much more popular these days Xbox is
literally just a computer now you can
use a keyboard and mouse on it if you're
like wow I really don't have a ton of
time to like research the stuff and
build my own thing and now buying it
even buying a graphics card from one
brand if there's 40 different options
for one type of GPU like what the heck
just get me whatever that'll work I
don't know it's interesting I often
allow myself to forget how overwhelming
learning something all new can be yeah
so I've recently been learning about DIY
lithium batteries why I wanted to soup
up my kids power wheels but also I was
just interested and so I've learned a
whole bunch of stuff it's better to
spot-weld it you lay them out like this
you need to make sure that your bus bars
run in such a configuration welding mmm
nope okay I will oh I actually just got
my roll of zinc which I have to verify
is actual zinc because a lot of the
places on like Aliexpress or whatever
we'll sell you rolls of zinc that are
actually just zinc coated steel so what
you have to do is you have to rub it put
it in with some saltwater make sure it
doesn't rest make sure it's actual as
ink so I've got that anyway so the so
the one that I showed I think I sent it
to you they send you by your DIY battery
yeah okay so that I made just soldering
and soldering 18 650 cells is not ideal
because heating them up is bad there's
like this very thin membrane at the end
of the cell that if you damaged and it
can be easily damaged by heat can
basically cause it to fail which can be
really bad because it's a lithium
battery so the problem with my battery
well there's a couple problems with my
battery anyway I just met I just I
wanted to see if it would work as as a
pack for my RC car because I wanted to
go from 2's to 3s which basically just
spins the motor 50 percent
can wear out your gearbox it can wear
out your motor but I don't really care
the mode the motors already kind of rat
bagged anyway because I was driving
around in the dirt and I got some like
Sam's stuck in it so like it sucks not
to a place in anyway and the gearbox I'm
not too worried about 3s as long as you
don't hit the throttle too hard it's not
a problem so anyway I just wanted to
just prove a concept know if it weren't
so I grabbed a power cord that I could
just sacrifice that I didn't need
stripped it grabbed the copper and it's
stranded copper wiring which I didn't
see coming but I was pretty annoyed when
I get better I wanted solid solid core
but in whatever it doesn't matter it
worked so I grabbed this stranded copper
wiring and I made myself a battery pack
out of it that's pretty and I couldn't
use my own stranded I couldn't use my
forgotten Bruce and like my rosin kit
because it'd be too bulky to fit in the
car so I was like okay I'm just gonna do
this like proof of concept and so the
the reason okay so the other problem is
my my joints are really cold they're
cold solder joints which means they're
like kind of lumpy like it didn't
completely melt properly they're not as
strong but the reason I did that was I
didn't want to heat them up too much and
this was just like proof of concept
these are cells that I harvested from a
failed battery pack from the Tesla Model
S Radio Flyer ride on so I left it out
in the cold or something cuz I forgot it
in the garage and a couple of the cells
failed so I ripped it apart and then
just check the voltages all them like a
couple of them died but the rest of them
were all still well within normal
margins they were at like 3.9 - so they
were very usable so I made a pack out of
these kind of disposable sort of and I
was sort of tinkering with them anyway
so the end game is to spot weld so you
use zinc strips and then you you spot
weld but it's it's so funny because
going into this so I've learned a lot
already but then now you're not getting
into you're not getting into like
batteries so much you're getting into
like spot welders land now so there's a
whole new like thing I got to do so
there phone case you can okay like
seriously - but even just making it even
getting to the point of spot welding
something you can by spot welders but
they're all kind of designed as far as I
can tell like the counter
top ones are designed kind of with a
specific purpose like they have a thing
and you like hold something up to it
whereas all the guys that are DIY in
them out of like car batteries and
capacitors are on an arm that you can
make your battery out of so I'm kind of
saying here why doesn't that exist as a
prepackaged thing maybe it does but it's
probably on eBay somewhere and are they
reputable I have no idea
everyone recommends building your own
but no one actually has look it's all
itemized here's exactly the thing out of
the let's say 40 bloody part numbers
here's the exact thing that actually
works exactly right for you so I'm like
I'm on this whole new journey of
discovery now just to figure out how to
spot well the damn battery together and
I don't even know if it's going to work
well so this comes back to helping me
figure out what's wrong with my battery
so I actually have a draft post because
I still needed to check a couple things
over on ARMA forum whoops
there you go so configure this 3s 3p
charge voltage reads correctly about
twelve point six volts but the car auto
powers off after just a few minutes with
the battery at and I needed to double
check this that's why I haven't actually
posted this yet but it's somewhere in
the neighborhood of like eleven point
eight volts which is not low enough it
should hold for much longer and so I
know enough just enough like it's just
enough to be dangerous so I know that
you know when a load increases you can
get a drop in voltage but I have a hard
time imagining that the pack dropped in
voltage so much that it would that would
trigger the low voltage protection in
the car that keeps your lithium
batteries from from over draining
themselves and becoming damaged
especially because I'm running a 3 s
pack instead of a 2 s pack so I have 50%
higher voltage in the first place
it's not like the balance leads actually
connect to the car so it has no way of
knowing how many cells I'm running
unless it just assumes based on your
initial voltage that you want to go down
to some value X minus y okay so I
thought maybe this is like a V group
issue but then why is it that out of the
gate I can I can go
hit it yeah and it's fine oh no no that
I'm sorry that wasn't the issue there
could be a Vedra tissue right the other
issue was I thought maybe the individual
cells I'm tripping they're over current
protection but then out of the gate why
does it work fine and then why does it
cut off late might be there might be
over current protection like lag almost
I doubt it
I doubt it too because that would
generally be heat activated and the way
that that works is that it won't work
again until you cool off and I'll have
to do is unplug and replug and it goes
okay
yeah and these ones should be fine for
Hydra anyway I pulled them out of a ride
on car like right it's theoretically
should be fine this is just a little RC
thing anyway one thing the chat brought
up and I would bring up as well is look
into maybe that maybe there's like a
spray foam solution or something but
like fire production from the batteries
oh I charged in and insulated they're
running oh I don't care if that car
blows up I give exactly zero FS all
right oh hey blueberry Wow there's one
blueberry okay I'm good thank you
oh so now it's just my problem to get
rid of it I traded I traded three
minutes of my time for one Tim Beck
anyway what's up this guy says lithium
cells can only provide a few amps no
it's not true there's lift themselves
that can provide quite a few amps yes I
know that the in polymers are lighter
they're also more dangerous I don't
really want to work with them I wouldn't
want to work with them either they're
sweet lipo is awesome but yeah
are we going through super chats um no I
mean maybe I don't know I don't know we
done I kind of think so really crap
we're done yeah um should we talk about
the smart uniforms like right max I'm
down yeah RC mail this is originally
from ABC you this is amazing
eleven schools in the province of I have
no idea how pronounced that qui zu Cui's
out sure sure
have introduced smart uniforms embedded
with computer chips to monitor students
movement to prevent them from skipping
classes skipping classes are leaving the
classroom without permission triggers an
alarm GPS tracked students movements
even beyond the school's grounds alarms
will sound if a student falls asleep in
class parents can monitor purchases
their child makes at the school and set
spending limits via a mobile app as
students enter the school the time and
date is recorded along with a short
video the parents can access via a
mobile app and facial recognition
ensures that each uniform is worn by its
rightful owner how the what facial
recognition yeah so if you walked past a
sensor that reads text the face gotcha
the two chips inserted into each
uniforms shoulders can withstand up to
500 washes Celsius an amazing amount of
washes that's a lot of washes last cuz
you're expected to buy a new uniform
every year if it's a private school okay
so this is scary yeah yeah
Wow okay you have kids
so I'm don't - like discount myself here
but I'm more interested in your feedback
okay so as a parent when they're still
minors I'm comfortable with myself
having this information yeah their
school should absolutely not yeah
because you can't control who at their
school can see that's right that's the
thing that worries me I'm not a parent
but my thing is like I have no clue who
has access to this and oh boy who
they're sharing with not anonymous
obviously yeah and I don't I mean that's
a huge security thing to trust cost of
tracking on your kids is a very crazy
security thing to trust
time's just it's something where they
can track you through your Facebook or
something yeah yeah anyone yeah just
anyway so the thing is that Ray is this
really any different from what already
exists
I don't know I don't have to like it I
think the act of facial facial
recognition thing is different yeah
that's different
detecting if you're asleep that's
different so there's obviously some kind
of like biometric monitoring going on
here like there's some pretty next-level
stuff here and controlling spending I
know that's like in the parents hands
that's great but that's probably also
controllable somewhere else so someone
could just like turn off their ability
to buy food and water we've got another
good one

patent filed earlier this year describes
a system capable of using audio data
captured by sound sensors to determine a
variety of performance metrics for
employees basically they patented
listening to every sound in their stores
so it can listen for noises made by
shoppers it can determine how long a
lineup is based on the distance between
noises made by guests you can figure out
the number of products purchased by
register beeps the number of bags used
by crinkling sounds heard also listens
to interactions between employees and
customers and customers and customers
that's definitely gonna happen you can
figure out whether your greeter is
actually greeting the guests Walmart
says this patent is a concept that would
help us gather metrics and improve the
checkout process by listening to the
sounds produced by the bags carts and
cash registers and not intended for any
other use but the patent also includes a
notification that the system could be
altered in any number of ways including
to listen in on shopping activity
throughout the store Wow oh yeah and
Jack Black has a gaming channel on
YouTube how did this make it into the
news alright so thanks for watching guys
we'll see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel
oh one more thing is horrible what's
that - purr chats oh right and super
chance something about their shirt in
Austrailia Wow for all six
two dollars they paid to ship it say
they bought like your punches oh wow
dang okay you guys are too dedicated
clearly pop says I build editing
workstation choose the i9 7900 X because
of higher PCIe lanes what's with the new
stuff having 16 lanes on i9 any
drawbacks it's just the mainstream
platform versus the high-end platform
that's how they differentiate it these
days number of PCI Express lanes and
number of memory channels frankly they
don't really affect performance much
you probably got worse performance for
your dollar but it's sort of too late
unfortunately someone else in chat can
confirm got the shirts I'm assuming
that's the Australia but I don't
actually you know who's shipping the
shirts right Patrick everything just
keeps coming back
Oh Andrew is it Andrew bishop that
you're saying yeah okay cool that's the
two shirts please add wedding shows as a
podcast to Spotify I mean nobody
listened to it on four years four years
I got a support request to the full
plain email please it's a different
company but I got I got a support like
like the guy who mainly monitors it
literally has no affiliation with -
actives I love you Joe but like he
doesn't work for like I've never met him
you have but you don't realize it
personally yeah but I've never since he
started at floatplane media you never
like sat down and like I have never
talked to him yeah so yeah so like then
you're actually SEP they're actually
different homies anyways we ought to
support requests asking someone was
asking if they could listen to the LAN
show then I was like yeah so people
still don't know like we've been doing
this for years but people have no idea
no it's just no one seems to care do you
know what though do we know what the
viewership is yeah no it's like it's
like a few hundred people per episode oh
that's like four for us yeah well yeah
people don't know I think part of it is
no one uses Spotify anymore right that's
why they're kind of dying unless you're
like
oh wait no sorry everyone uses Spotify
nobody's a SoundCloud anymore
unless you're a rapper speaking of 400
people being nothing but these days with
a stream earlier today that on top of
the viewers on Twitch and floatplane of
which there were some thank you for
fixing that by the way hooray that was
Yuki thank you that 63 thousand viewers

destroy saying it for a while every
other record YouTube is the future of
streaming stuff oh yeah

gonna figure that out but this is me
unboxing a gaming computer yeah like I
did not clickbait it that was exactly as
advertised sir okay I called it unboxing
the God of gaming pcs yeah have you seen
it no it's a digital storm event MX yeah
does it like create other computers I
don't know how to they were surprised do
they LEDs only turn on every seven days
really heavy
it's like shockingly heavy it weighs as
much as the mineral oil PC like easily
why what's in it a lot of water oh so it
is water cool it's water cooled oh yeah
yeah yeah a lot of copper like it's just
really really cool do you mind doing me
a favor and heading to the LTX site we

you would highly recommend that if
you're thinking about going book your
flight now we've gotten a lot of really
good feedback from people that are like
yo thank you for telling me the dates so
early it was a third of the price of
last time like literally a third of the
price so it's way cheaper you don't
think we're gonna run out of tickets
well it's a big venue you know what it's
gonna be interesting because with the
dreamhack element as well there's sort
of an x-factor there we actually don't
know how many tickets are gonna sell for
this oh yeah yeah oh yeah it's not gonna
be like sold out in three minutes or
anything like that
yeah and we're gonna do multiple waves
of tickets so if you are coming then get
your fight flight and hotel looks like
there's no real reason to not do it now
all right is that it someone in chat
said plane ticks are not a third of the
price maybe for some people maybe from
some airport and maybe you should do
some airline maybe you should be using
PIAA maybe should be hey Dan think of
that maybe the airline you booked
through the site you booked through
whatever thinks you're a fluid some
wants to make it more expensive yeah so
VPN to a less generally affluent area
and you might have more success
jonno asks if I want a skid of maple
buffalo bacon I'm gonna go with no yes
that would be no yes streaming streaming
should we return the Walmart PC for
refund or have them send us a fixed
version I'll return it for refund are
you gonna make another video I don't
know you wanna make another video then
sure hmm what was broken well it's just
like dumb like I think they're just like
fixing it oh yeah return it for a refund
then because it's not gonna be any
different still gonna be dumb should I
make another video that you wouldn't be
able to do it to like mid to late
January though at this point we've got
seats yes I still think why why do I get
these emails like these kinds of emails
are the ones that give me a headache for
an entire weekend at 5:48 on a Friday
Colton Potter sends me an email
declined new channel do we have plans of
doing another one in 2019 or is that
still up in the air thanks Colton Potter
why does he do these things to me I
don't wanna think about that I don't
care about him being stressed out all
weekend how is that my problem why is it
my problem no I don't want to do a new
channel yeah he's gonna be like gonna be
like look how successful Tech linked is
we should just copy-paste that you know
it's not that simple Tech linked it had
a host already it had a format already
all we had to do was like would play
connect the dots it was paint-by-numbers
slang home give it a home you know we
hire Steve and even that was a nightmare
we hope the awesome errs command center
heck yeah gamers that's wonderful they
like to start references and we're
losing we're losing viewers at an
incredible rate incredible rate okay
speaking of speaking of things that are
my problem oh yes right if you have
questions or you're having problems or
anything like that with the flow play
migration come check out my stream I'll
be streaming tonight switch on TV slash
look on the scribe I'm imagining like
the annual migratory movement of the
float planes across the oh my god like
when we're bigger and we like maybe have
someone who can do that kind of stuff
that would been really cool to like have
a post and have like make it look like a
migration of float planes that would
have been awesome but ya know we're
still really small that's okay at our
time working on getting bigger matter
time babies yeah there's there's been
some really good feedback also if you
have feedback or suggestions you can
come bug me about it too but there's
been some really good feedback people
have I had at least one person say
they're watching it from India and it's
working but it's like not the greatest
yeah we don't have an edge super close
to there and I've had a couple people
mention that recently so we will be
looking into getting something up a
little bit closer to there I mean at
this point like honestly I'm down to
kind of spin up as many
just get them all over the place one
thing that we're working on is one thing
that I'm actually gonna have a person
that I'm not naming yet who's sort of
joining the team maybe ish working on is
the automation of doing that cool yeah
okay so they don't all have to be
manually done and we're gonna be working
with a different server provider to spin
up someone's in areas that we don't
currently have access to well we've
already started working on that but we
want to automate it and stuff so yeah
it's coming along
I can imagine with our edge map right
now that India is not doing the greatest
and there's a few other areas that I've
heard that feedback from as well so
we're definitely gonna work on it
all right see you guys
was asking his handmade
all right I posted the chat oh oh crap I
forgot to put things but stuff hooray</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
