webcam and I saw a little notification
that when new updates are available for
for Windows Vista now I do run Windows
Vista and I actually quite like Windows
Vista and here's why everyone complains
about the stability of Windows Vista and
that's not to mean I don't like seven
I've actually moved over to seven on my
personal computer at this time but I
just wanted to say you know what - all
the Vista bashers out there how many of
you have a system that has almost 2,000
hours of uptime so I'm going to do the
math here this is my this is my work
system I use it five days out of the
week and I multitask oh yeah actually
here cameraman have a look at my taskbar
here I am like all over the place
everything from MSN to Microsoft Paint
to a wide variety of Excel spreadsheets
to more paint to WinRAR to remote
desktop connection to Windows Live Movie
Maker which I'm using all the time for
my blog stuff so anyway 2000 hours what
does that come to two thousand divided
by 24 so that's how many days I've been
up straight divided by approximately 30
days in a month so with my Windows Vista
machine here I managed to go almost
three months without a restart and I'm
finally restarting it because I have
some updates I want to install so there
you go all the Windows Vista bashers BAM
three months BAM</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
