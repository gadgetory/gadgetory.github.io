created a fire pole for me kind of
remember that yeah from the it wasn't
the real up on the top of the mezzanine
down no no you you made a fire pole is
it real is it an illusion only the
editors will know by the end of the day
I want you to have a real fire pole
installed that I can slide down you know
I have things to do right yeah they look
really really important all right cool

service that encrypts all of your
Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP and it's got tons of other
useful features as well check it out now

alright so plenty how long do you spend
developing this plan well extend this
they'll have this thing here we'll have
people holding onto this which people we
can find people on the street and we'll
also clamp it onto the railing up there
can I reveal something that you probably
don't know there's pieces of information
I don't have okay so when we put in
these stairs we've never actually
intended for anyone to walk down them
these are the way up oh I knew that
fire pool installation BAE baebae wow
this is a little nerve-wracking mine be
so instead of having this long pole go
this way like this way we can attach it
to several of these posts instead okay
so what saw the Yolo plan what do you
mean the yellow plan
I want something simpler and faster than
this be serious
maybe fewer people one person will
attach weights to it will tape weights
to this and rope we have rope alright

a pro no you're not serious about but
yellow right yeah yeah yo girlie no
you're not no no you're not not
yellowing I'm gonna tell the fun I don't
want to lose my job because he died the
fire pole is going in today what
happened to the safety concerns we have
insurance for this I think if anyone
came in and inspected our implementation
maybe they'd be really happy with it oh
yeah yeah I'll have a cross brace we'll
attach it to the post yeah this all
sounds incredibly stupid I feel like I
should be wearing a hard hat yeah did we
have a hard hat this is a solid door
right it's like fire rated I know this
song as long as we actually put it
together properly oh no that's terrible
fuck
