I'm gonna yet again she would pull it up
on my phone because because of the
that I did you get them no okay you guys
are gonna win it some fly hunting throw
the show because there's one that just
will not leave us alone and I believe
Lewis is gonna murder it before we're
done but to to introduce people here
Louis Rossman fighter of Apple repairer
of everything what's your like channel
and stuff what varies kaulitz Rossman
grew up with two S's and two ends that's
a good way to do that
level one Tex Wendell how's it going
Linux master man if you don't hit me now
go this will be a recurring it's it's
been feeding it would be an honor to be
assaulted by Louis Ross I'm also known
to be a target just go for gold yeah
[Laughter]
okay yeah channel level one text any
other calls you want to do how's it
going yeah there we go Wendell Jayce two
sets you guys probably know Jay used to
send everywhere yeah what is he it's not
jay-z on Twitter no but if you're gonna
tag me tag Beyonce - yeah might as well
include it and this win show will
probably not be super standard we have
some news topics I don't know what
almost any of them are we know that the
there's some updates to the MacBook Pro
chrome is using more ram wow that's
surprising and some other stuff but I
doubt we'll get to a ton of it because
we'll probably go into crazy tangents
and we might kill a fly
gonna roll the intro it'll be back in a
second
Oh
private Internet access VPN and savage
jerky of the sponsors for the show me
try to reset this and then go back to me
so new back book pro's coming out they
have replaced the keyboard but as we
were talking before the show I'm not
gonna fail anymore
wrong it is a third generation butterfly
keyboard however this design was was not
intended to solve the recently
highlighted butterfly keyboard issues
that's a direct quote from Apple isn't
it I I believe so it's not in quotes
here but I believe so oh not well I mean
there was no problem with it begin with
right so what was the akka i generally
stay away from from those but what was
the actual problem well it's people
would say that the key is either not
working or it'll type 20 times when you
press it once and usually people would
show up and say I didn't get any water
on it it just happened that I'd open it
and it would be yellow and brown and
ugly but some of these look like they're
just new out of the box and the keys
just don't work on them well then it
started to be something where it once a
day somebody would show up then five
people a day would show up then when we
had like 20 to 40 people showing up a
day with the same problem and calling
and emailing about it I realized this is
gonna be a yeah that's the super shallow
flat real thin key yes that goes feeling
every time you type it that really
obnoxious annoying one it's not like a
nice mechanical keyboard noise it's a
mechanical keyboard noise with out any
of the gist mechanic part yeah yeah but
throw is just so short but it's equally
what I'm hearing here is we got a new
keyboard but it could potentially have
all the same problems as the other one
well yeah they they specifically didn't
even roll this keyboard out to fix the
problem so I assume assume there was it
was never a problem right I got it I got
to put the Apple back hat back on do you
have a sense that if it it's more than
like a year old it's exponentially more
likely to fail unnaturally or is it is
it age-related at all I don't know I
think it's even age-related because some
people showing up with this have had it
for six or eight months and they'll show
up and ask we can fix
they don't want to wait a week or two
for the Apple store to do it hmm weird
not good just like I come forward just
don't hold it that way yeah it's just
this really weird level of utopianism
where I think like if it honestly
reminds me what my history teacher used
to talk about with with Russia and the
Soviet Union where somebody would be
called the counter-revolutionary because
they did something wrong and they would
that guy would get thrown in prison and
then the guy that was throwing him in
prison would wind up getting thrown in
prison by somebody else but like
somebody will say my machine is getting
really hot and I get lines on the screen
and I'll say why don't you get AppleCare
yet I don't care anybody would have been
covered and then the guy and then the
guy that says that ends up one day out
of AppleCare with the machine we're like
it'll just start randomly crashing and
he's like oh my god maybe that other
person was right but then he'll post in
the forum and I go why didn't you get
they'd released the replacement program
for it why didn't you get it and one of
the funny things was the 2010 MacBook
where they say it had a crashing problem
because they used the wrong capacitor
they released the replacement program in
2013 that only covered the Machine three
years from the date of purchase and the
machine was manufactured in 2002 you
were sitting there going f5 f5 f5 f5 and
their warranty page maybe you would be
able to get it but it's a but if you
believe that Apple products are this
great because in some ways they are you
know they're easy to use they use PCI
Express SSDs in 2013 they had really
great screens they don't crash as often
if you're comparing its older windows
and something goes wrong you really
don't want to believe that the product
is bad yeah so you either have to admit
that they have faults or you have to
deny your own experience and what drives
me nuts is when people will actually
believe I'm typing on it wrong I'm
holding it wrong
I'm encoding video on a row and that's
what tries me not it's not that the
product itself is terrible it's that
when something goes wrong with it people
will just treat themselves as if they
did something wrong rather than if the
company did some because they truly
believe the product is fail proof yeah
it's like you know it's not like other
companies don't have faults to which
test if somebody buys an HP and that
happens they will yell at HP they won't
but if something happens with an Apple
product and that's the same fault
they'll just believe that they did
something wrong and it drives me up a
wall yeah
and it's it's it's it's a frustrating
experience too because like I I've
generally liked apples ecosystem because
I will send certain people
they're like like for instance my mom I
tried to get her to get an iPhone then
she got used to Android so there's no
point trying to flip that over again but
I tried to get her to get an iPhone
because like you said they're they're
quite easy easy to use they're usually
fairly intuitive all that kind of stuff
but then when you start having these
problems it's like okay you're spending
it with this new app MacBook up to like
seven thousand dollars if you want to
get the crazy one next year
oh there you make it pretty expensive
what you can get six cores 32 gigs of
ram like 4 terabyte SSD so you can get
the specs ridiculously high which is I
guess part of the factor because any
time you tear up anything in Apple's
customizer expensive and there's some
things that they do well you know if
David Bowie was coming back to life for
20 minutes and I have one chance to
record you've been around again I would
want to do it on a Mac not Windows 10
right it's just I don't want to deal
with all these problems Windows 10 might
try to you know man okay so for LTX
which is tomorrow we have we have two
guests here from the forum two guys that
I've never met before which i think is
actually really cool that they're coming
I haven't seen them yet
but two admins on the forum and one of
them came over here with his business
laptop and he had a Windows Update hit
him while he was here and it bricked his
windows I remember the exact details but
he had to rush here in the morning and
borrow a computer in a flash drive so he
could get Windows onto a flash drive so
he could completely reformat everything
so he could keep working Microsoft
genuinely earned the reputation that
they have and they are the people that
will put up with this nonsense from
Apple just to escape it I completely
understand it well I've had two systems
completely fail on update to the point
to where it was the system was
completely unstable and I remember
getting Windows Vista with a new machine
where when it first came out you
couldn't even run programs without
running an update you would just try to
open a new browser and it would just sit
there and then 20 minutes later it would
open yeah really bad what my computer
was one of the admittedly I guess
probably over the overall spectrum the
amount of people that had this happen to
him not that high percentage but my
computer was one of the ones that when
they forced the upgrade to Windows 10 I
wasn't even at home I had denied the
upgrade so many times then I was at work
and while I was at work my computer
upgraded from Windows 7 and Windows 10
and bricked itself that was when they
implemented the like click here now
before this countdown
gone if you don't want it yeah because
they new people leaving their systems on
walking away going to work yeah whatever
you come back suddenly mid update and I
even ran the scripts that are supposed
to stop it but then they'd release some
update that would get around that and it
was just very frustrating
one thing I've enjoyed this entire
conversation is that Wendell has been
almost silent hasn't said anything yet
we're not wrong well no yeah okay use
that but it's the Linux man yes like
Linux there are systems that I have that
have up times of like 600 days which is
actually really bad because there are
kernel updates and security updates and
stuff like that so those machines are
potentially etosha with Mary but yeah
600 days of uptime yeah I like running
Windows in a virtual machine because
then it's it's like oh look what
Facebook herself I can just hit a button
and it's like oh look it's the way that
it was yesterday
nice try Microsoft you failed one of the
things we're actually working on back in
my studio right now is if you landed on
my hand right now so we're gonna we're
gonna get them okay we actually we're
actually gonna do some rollback some
force updates we're gonna do comparative
benchmarks to see how much it actually
impacts your system both high-end and
low-end because there's time we're doing
benchmarks we really don't see
something's weird like we start going
you know really super stuttery or
something we realize like oh look a
background process updates happening
it's eating 25% of our resources yeah
yeah Anna tech ran into that with their
there's n plus coverage yeah the like
rise of the Tomb Raider a whole bunch of
games who are running it as good or
slightly better on AMD than Intel and it
was because they had the high precision
timer which reading and writing from
hardware registers triggers the meltdown
specter mitigations more again yeah so
depending on what you're doing you could
have a significant reduction in
performance right it's an interesting
situation do you want to talk a little
bit about not too much because we got a
video to release but you want to talk a
little bit about what you're doing here
with Anthony it was exciting here yeah I
spent from I spent Monday and Tuesday
with Anthony doing Linux stuff and it's
Linux on gaming gaming on Linux and so
we look at native Linux on gaming which
is pretty cool it basically works and
then gaming through wrappers like wine
and
all the various flavors about running 12
different versions of wine at the same
time easily and then finally
virtualization and the horizon for doing
everything through a virtual machine and
not really sacrificing anything in terms
of performance so I'm really looking
forward to that that'll be really good
will have companion guides and stuff on
the forum for like really nitty-gritty
step-by-step if you want to do Fedora or
Ubuntu or you know arch or whatever and
everything he just said is why we were
talking earlier about how Apple is
sometimes more easily accessible like 12
different versions of wine yeah
oh so you're running a game for Mac well
you're gonna have to do the metal API
yeah let's say 15 years ago if you
wanted to do a digital audio workstation
Linux was terrible for it but it's
gotten a lot better you know yes I still
I still got some rough edges I extremely
rarely do do the hip things and go to
clubs and stuff but the only time I ever
will is for one of my friends and on his
birthday and we went to one place and I
noticed that the DJ had a giant MSI
laptop with an argue full RGB keyboard
and stuff I was even thinking like
that's just like weird like I took a
photo because I was like oh it's cool
but it's it's usually a MacBook and even
just it was one of the like thick ones
because I had the I believe it was one
mechanical keyboard once so like this
isn't huge yeah it's a massive massive
cumbersome laptop that he brings to
shows firmly believe that this like we
want laptops as thin as paper I don't
think that a lot of consumers really
want that I think consumers like thin
and light but I think if you tell a
consumer hey you can get five more years
out of this machine if it's got a
replaceable keyboard and it's just a
hair thicker reasonable you've talked
about this a bunch with phones not to
admit that I watched a huge amount of
your content and have since way before I
made videos but you're talking about how
you see a lot of reviewers review a
phone and it's different than consumers
looking at a phone yeah because we're
thinking there's plastic backs all that
kind of stuff
there's this big disconnect when I read
a review and then when I talk to people
who come in and say what they want on a
phone just well you know let's say we're
fixing somebody's phone we can have a 15
minute conversation I've never heard a
normal person that I've met in real life
talk about the bezel of a phone every
single reviewer they'll spend two or
three
power grabs talking about the bezel well
you know how it goes out to the end and
now if I've no casing at all I've never
heard somebody talk about that or care
you know in real life they think you
know it would be nice if I drop my phone
from here to here that it not break they
don't care about the bezel or they'll
say the back is made of premium
materials but the regular person will
see I can see fingerprints that's ugly
yeah or they're gonna stick it in a case
anyway you know yeah an ass that you
know like a phone like this has to go in
a case because it's it'll crack if I go
from here to here yeah and the back of
it looks nice but if I actually touch it
you can feel the only thing I care about
with bezel is whether or not it's
slippery by it without a case yeah and
the other things are getting more slick
over time you know and that's that's
always bugged me but other than that
it's why you don't really see phone
reviews on my channel because I'm one of
those people that just don't care about
any of that yeah you so the phone
imagine if you said I think that if you
put it in a bullet point two years from
now it will still work the battery can
be replaced and it's not gonna slow down
too terribly that somebody may actually
consider buying it over something else
you know you have an extra eighth of a
millimeter but you can replace the
battery
LG g5 for just that reason it's no
ancient by today's standards but
removable battery and metal back and it
still has a fingerprint sensor and it's
not like super and I see a lot of people
say yeah but in two years you're gonna
get a new phone anyway it's okay you may
get a new phone anyway in two years but
somebody that doesn't want to spend the
extra two or four hundred dollars isn't
being I'm sorry I used to be an annual
upgrader but not anymore
like I'll go I'll go two years plus and
usually the only thing that will make me
upgrade is if I start seeing bad battery
degradation that's only because I've
been on iPhone for the longest time now
it's because it's super simple and
that's only because it's not easy to
service battery swaps you know for an
average great end user so I think that
design kind of peaked around probably
the galaxy s3 mmm-hmm cos removable
battery upgradable storage and it still
had a plastic back yeah and there were
cases for that you could replace the
back like you got you take the back off
and have like a leather back if you
wanted oh and when I was still working
in iti we had an entire fleet of s3 is
out there and you could do the extended
battery with the extend back cover you
know we were sending those out into the
field yeah a lot of people said well the
battery life on modern phones is good
enough that you don't need a second
battery to get through the day but that
totally ignores that or not me yeah
after it's not even added that that's
not even
so much as it is one year or two years
later when it barely has any battery
life I want that I'm gonna keep this
thing for longer than two years in Rio
no reason to buy and I think more people
would buy it if you actually advertise
that and I haven't seen anybody
advertised longevity as a feature know
one thing in twitch chat I posted a poll
because I'm I'm interested on the exact
percentages at least for our audience
which is a terrible section if we want
to be scientific but whatever I want to
see the exact percentages of people that
care about ultra thin bezels
so check straw poll in the chat and s3
specifically I have one interesting
story with that that ties into what
you're talking about with it should be
able to fall right I was I was at
university and I was late for class so I
was sprinting and I ran down a huge set
of steps and I had too much momentum and
there was one of those like polls that
stopped cars from going into areas so I
decided I'll just hop over it and I jump
and I remember that my as I'm midair I
remember that my phone is in my sweater
pocket not in my jeans pocket it goes
flying smacks into the ground the
battery goes one way the bat goes the
other way the rest of the phone goes the
other way tiny chip in the corner put
everything back together turn it back on
works perfectly my phone was that s3 it
was a hex on a break yeah and they're
like I think one of the things that
actually helps is that it kind of
explodes and it like says I can't remove
the correct terminology for it but the
force of the impact goes with each part
and lets it yeah blow I was three one of
the earlier glass yeah yeah yeah before
they kept making the grill that's
thinner which then just made it as
brittle as anything else yeah well with
the g5 where it's got the replaceable
battery and still kind of modern I've
replaced the battery in 70 twice yeah I
mean it's it was basically launched
iPhone and it's you just slide it out
and slide a new battery in it's eight
books from China
yeah that's the other thing you can get
those batteries so cheap if you buy them
third party so the the poll results for
people that didn't click on results when
they ended is about 78% of people do not
care about ultra thin bezels and 28
while I guess yeah 22 percent of people
do that's the audience but watching at
an Integra view Channel yeah so it's
skewed but I don't necessarily know in
what direction it's still it's such a
high percentage that like we've seen it
though we've seen
early polls you let them go for five
minutes or five days it tends to
whatever like the first few minutes
ratio it won't change the song goes yeah
generally stay there yeah yeah so like I
and well the thing is if you if you
expose that poll to a much different
audience yeah it might shift it a bit
more but I I kind of doubt it I have had
a similar experience I'm sure you've
talked to more people about it but I've
had a similar experience talking to just
friends and family yeah like what would
you want in a phone I've ever reading so
many phone reviews for this and I saw
one Eli the computer guy clip of a video
very you know with his $500 camera
pointing at it saying this is me load in
Google Maps this is it not lagging and I
just thought sold that's all I really
care because that I do every day when I
go to you know hail an uber is it gonna
take forever when I want to scroll
around is it gonna take forever it is
this is the battery last you know things
like that with phones these days that
can like play relatively decent graphic
fidelity games at relatively decent
frame rates like they can probably open
uber and Google Maps relative like we've
progressed so far in the mobile
computing oh yeah these things all right
like the early days of smartphones back
when I had my blackberry storm and the
Droid 1 was out and the iPhone 3 and 3G
or 3GS you know it's like back then it
was a big deal like this one Scrolls
smoother where the Android was choppy
and stuff were obviously there was big
variance between the devices but now
everything's so damn close yeah it's
really hard to differentiate a winner it
really comes down to the to the
interface I think the interface battle
is the thing that keeps Android iPhone
and then I think like surprise black
crazy was still around but the only
other person I've met the tediz storm
that was I had a storm because you feel
about the first generation storm I never
used I never used the because I think I
had a physical keyboard - you remember
quickly that one know that there was no
physical that was the one that clicked
that's right it had the it clicks like
the whole screen went yeah but it only
had one button in the middle right as
you got further out to the edge you go I
got it because I mean I was on Verizon
and we didn't have any other options at
the time yeah you know iPhone obviously
didn't come to Verizon until the the 4s
was out and then
it lacked so badly right and then seven
minutes so as soon as the droid won the
original droid came out I replaced the
BlackBerry with that and then I carried
both iPhone and Samsung work for quite a
while so I I've got a very unique
perspective of at least back in 2013
what it was like to be a duel wielder
you know yeah yeah I never had any
experience on the other side of the road
back then but I remember when like the
first Android butter update came out mmm
that like that was the biggest deal I
had seen in a while
because it massive I think blue cleaners
was like one of the first ones I was on
oh yeah yeah yeah okay you know what
phone was massively underrated was the
last generation t-mobile Sidekick I
heard like people really liked it yeah
it ran Java which is like you would
think it would be a pile of garbage
cuz Java it's especially in those days
because I was before Android but the
thing with the phone is that if it does
what you wanted to do really well that
it's a really good phone it doesn't need
to be a status symbol the sidekick was
kind of like it looked like a toy but
had a good keyboard and the screen was
decent but it also had a color LCD that
was reflective so you're not gonna get
like photorealistic color but you could
get color and so the battery life would
last forever like days because it wasn't
actually having a backlight unless it
was dark outside
even you mentioned status symbol to
here's a here's a strawpoll might be
interesting how many people choose a
phone based on it being an accessory or
a status thing yeah right because III
think a lot of people choose their phone
based on where people gonna think of my
phone I think it's kind of sad but I
feel like there's a good percentage of
people that care how many people are
gonna admit to that though okay it's not
really much of a problem anymore but
there was a there was a while there or
like the the pricey phones couldn't
connect to like a corporate email and
stuff like that primarily and so I was
on the receiving end of that and it's
like you need to get this phone or this
phone if you wanted to work properly
with your email system or they're like
I'm gonna buy this because it looks like
I'm wealthy and it's just that was one
of the reasons why I had the BlackBerry
to begin with because when I was working
in software at the time in our IT
department we had you know all of our
own mail servers and stuff it wasn't
through standard pop or any of that
stuff so it was the phone that could
connect to it but I'll be the first to
admit that one of the reasons why I got
I phone back when it first came to
Verizon was simply because it was
something I couldn't
get before and suddenly I could and
everyone had it and I wanted it because
of that and I literally it's just state
with it ever since because I got used to
it and I'm comfortable I'm not really a
mobile power user and I don't need well
by being greeted by the iPhone 4 it was
not completely unusable but the iPhone
the one that didn't have copy/paste I
just can't imagine that world
yeah I see I joined long after that
obviously what speaking of not being
able imagine that world will start from
over here and go across what was your
favorite phone like at that point in
time I guess at that point in time I
think the HTC incredible in 2010 because
the other Android phones were slow and
clunky I was coming from a blackberry
storm so six-minute boot time opening
browser takes a minute every time you do
something in stutters and I got that
phone and when I would tap something it
just opened immediately there was no lag
I'm sure if I upgrade it to a new
version of Android with it or a newer I
shouldn't say new yeah as well yeah and
it also actually fit in your hand
comfortably right very few phones will
fit in my hand comfortably now because
they're large just really big yeah - the
- has a similar problem - that he likes
old iPhones because they're much smaller
mm-hmm what about you I've never had a
phone that I like for more than six
months like it's okay for six months and
then with the software updates and
whatever I'm doing to it it starts to
run really bad okay what what phone had
the best six month period then probably
the t-mobile Sidekick yeah the very last
generation one because you could really
quickly but switch between a bunch of
tasks the web browsing wasn't terrible
instant messaging wasn't terrible email
was pretty good there was a there was
one device before that that was like
really it was a little before that era
uh there was like a Motorola pager thing
it wasn't on a phone that thing was
awesome I had that before I had a cell
phone and that was like because then
people couldn't call me it was great I
mine would probably be my s3 I'm gonna
be easy
basically that story s3 was awesome
thing was a tank I had it for so long I
think it still works we got close
we I had that phone for a very very long
I hate him did you see it hit the ground
he spiraled and he came back up he won't
actually hit him look got him but he's
not dead he's spiraling to keep flu back
up big work one was gonna get sucked
into that machine and be on one of the
fans yeah he's right there there's
another one yeah there's three I was so
excited I felt like my leg was gonna be
the death platform for this fly and I
was I was stoked but yeah Adam is 3 what
about you I really liked the s3 just cuz
it was a good size improvement but I
don't want to copy your answer so
probably my original Droid because I
actually laid around back then with a
lot of routing roms actually wrote it my
own soundboard app back then for like
playing my daughter's first words I
wrote that for my wife so she could have
it at her phone and so it was a lot of
fun but then I think back then obviously
there was a lot of limitations there the
first moto droid and battery life kind
of sucked and early Android wasn't as
smooth it was clunky it took them like a
year to make TouchWiz not up joint right
my prom with the Samsung phones was my
tableau where they came with yeah so
that drives me nuts yeah I've never I've
that's one reason why I'm on a pixel
right now it's just the stock experience
is always preferred for most most other
phones that I've had I've tried as hard
as I possibly can to revert it to a
stock based experience I do not like any
of the custom UIs I don't like any of
that kind of stuff it's all it's all
garbage just phones - amazing let's crap
it up boys yeah I've never seen somebody
asking us say I would like this phone to
run slower please add your own software
to it yeah you ever seen anybody ask for
the big spike a little bit more leg it's
kind of like laptops now Rach Emma sighs
notorious for crap ton of dashboards and
bloatware and stuff you know it's like
you get rid of all that stuff it's a
good experience but otherwise when you
work in a shop that sells
not necessarily a repair shop but when
you work in a shop that sells laptops
and one of your main services is making
them not junk out of the box that's
that's like a weird weird place to be
we have pull results for the the
question NAT surprise
I don't think it's true at all
all choose themselves oh yeah definitely
people are lying well it might be a
little bit of lying it might be a little
bit of subconscious shifting where
you've decided that you want that foam
because of say this anyways you'll
justify it because of performance or
future reasons and I think probably the
strongest factor is that the audience
that we have
well there's smartphone MPT right if you
have a crappy phone the guy next to you
pulls up the latest version you're kind
of like oh right I want the same thing
if you've got the latest one you kind of
want to be like everyone look at my
phone you know because it's it's sad but
it really is like an accessory yeah yeah
yeah but like again with our audience
though it's it's a bunch of PC
performance freaks I'm not that
surprised that PC performance freaks
want high performance and high feature
phones if we did this survey across
everyone on the planet and everyone
answered honestly I bet you status would
probably be higher than anything else
probably but with this audience and with
natural skew am I'm not surprised it was
95 percent well people really admit that
because then they have to admit to
themselves I spend an extra four hundred
dollars for status and that's not a pill
that I think most people would swallow
yeah it's it's it's an interesting
question like the do you buy things for
for like like functionality over
aesthetic or aesthetic over
functionality I think a lot of people
will say that they buy something for
functionality but they might even be
buying the aesthetic of functionality if
that makes sense yeah if something looks
like it's highly functional then they
want that thing it's it's a really
interesting mind game scenario because
you might be convincing yourself of
something and now you can realize
through system there's a dimension of
that that's sort of related which is
taking your customizations and your
settings and stuff and that has always
been like if you spend a lot of time
customizing your phone or customized
going ever it is to make it exactly just
so you will be punished because every
time there's an update or every time you
switch phones it is super difficult to
get all those customizations from one
device to another and it shouldn't be
yeah that's one of the few things I
liked about Apple's operating system is
that when you use migration assistant
and time machine it just copies
everything every app even the settings
within your applications will get all
even your third-party applications
I'll get copied over perfectly it's
really one of the reasons why I stayed
on it's gonna be I owe s for so long was
simply because a new phone copy from
previous backup you know restore up and
running and everything's exactly how I
left it I don't even use the ecosystem I
don't have a watch I'm out of it I don't
have an apple or what's the Apple TV
thing I'll have anything I have no other
part of the ecosystem I even have a
MacBook but even they aren't connected
yeah yeah Microsoft really screwed the
pooch with the registry because the
registry was supposed to be that and
also your application data folder and
like theoretically you can move between
machines but in a Yank
it ends badly every time yeah you can
copy a certain features of certain
applications but not everything and you
have to reinstall the applications
yourself I noticed that when when you
upgrade to a new phone new device right
it doesn't save the apps or anything it
saves the app data and then redownload
the apps fresh and then really populates
data yeah
which before it used to be like you said
a direct copy which was even I believe
in the earlier days was even copying the
battery data which was making new
batteries perform like poor batteries
because of that efficiency scale yeah so
I did notice that when I created this
one yeah that was one of the worst
things like working in a like computer
shop and you'd be doing services and you
someone would buy a new computer and
they'd want a data transfer and I try to
because I tried to be at least somewhat
honest I would try to explain to them
this is pretty easy to do on your own
but if they wanted it anyways sure
whatever sounds good and you go to do it
and then you have to tell them that they
can't bring any of their programs and
there's just that kind of that's a 20
minute conversation and there's like
this ratio where like as the customer is
older the conversation is longer yeah
there's yeah and then you have to
explain well you have to remember your
own Wi-Fi password and you'll have to do
this and that because we do data
recovery and sometimes we can recover it
to where you can do a you can use
migration assistant when you get all
their programs and sometimes you can't
and I'm just copying your data folder
from here to here and a lot of people
even if I explain to them you have to
reinstall your programs your settings
will not be the same when they show up
they go where's my where's my stuff
yeah it's on this folder like a your
music isn't the music folder okay but
well no it's in there you just got a lot
of bytes
yeah I've had people actually break down
with tears because they didn't remember
their email password yeah yeah you know
password was in the unlike I can't get
you that it's like yeah I and the email
password is an interesting one too
because one of the biggest things is is
like they won't have a password manager
they won't have written their passwords
down which I guess that's good
but they won't know how to log into
anything yeah and it's just like
carrying those sessions over would be
super nice yeah what they're paying for
is not fee to transfer the data they're
paying for the half hour conversation
you're going to have about every single
program yeah yeah there's some people
that it's it's literally it's just not
even worth upgrading the computer yes
they would just lose all their stuff
yeah it's like okay well I guess I'll
deal with the slow terrible experience
because it's better than losing all my
programs and all my settings and all my
logins and all that yeah and that
especially ones it being true in
broadcast or me in the music business
because people will have certain plugins
and if you upgrade to a new operating
system they won't they won't work
anymore and you'll have to find
alternatives or this program like once
they get a rig that works it works and
they just they want to keep it as is and
know that stuff can cost a lot yeah like
a new operating system will mess up this
is always you stepping with OS 10 in Pro
Tools
new OS Pro Tools wouldn't work right or
just that stuff can be a nightmare for
people yeah
the copy-protection they bury things
somewhere on the system and sometimes
it's just a software compatibility thing
both of those things are terrible what
is it like on Linux so I've never
actually tried every single Linux
version that I've had has been full pure
from scratch every time so that's it
it's an interesting question I never try
to migrate from machines mostly it's
okay so like I have I have a file that
customizes the command line and provide
some aliases and shortcuts and stuff
like that and I've been working on that
for 20 years and I've never lost it and
it's great and it's just like the best
thing ever so it's like literally 20
years of preferences in that file
other stuff is the most Linux thing I've
ever heard not so good like other stuff
the migration is a little bit more of a
pain one of the things that you bunt
who's done recently is they have this
thing called snaps and so because you
you like you have this version of this
library that
program needs and you need a slightly
different version of that library for
some older program that can be
problematic to run those combinations of
things and so one of the things that
snaps does for you is that it packages
all of your dependencies inside this
file which uses more space but makes it
the way that you have to worry about
being able to run those things less so
in terms of like I want to migrate all
my programs to just be able to run it
with those kinds of technologies
generally you're a lot more successful
but like a lot of the things with like
kdenlive kdenlive is a great example
because we get lots of support requests
for kdenlive whenever forum came lob is
a great program but 90% of the problems
with kdenlive not actually kdenlive it's
the libraries there are bugs in the
libraries and so you can have audio sync
issues and things like that and that is
just the libraries on the system and so
snaps can help with stuff like that on
ubuntu cool and other technologies and
other distros can help with that so it's
very user respecting but it's still not
quite as slick of a solution as it could
be right I am going to take this slight
intermission to do something that I
actually completely forgot that I had to
do which is sponsors so just give me a
sec guys sorry first up we have private
Internet access private Internet access
is a VPN you guys probably know what it
is at this point it has encryption
authentication services that works for
Windows Mac iOS Android iOS Linux again
it still says Linus in the dock drives
me nuts it does not work on Linus
it works on Google Chrome and it has
support for several other platforms
coming soon you can connect up to five
devices under one account at the same
time so you can have like your phone and
your laptop and your desktop and
whatever else all connected it has an
internet kill switch so if your VPN
disconnects for whatever reason it will
disconnect you from the internet so that
you don't accidentally send any data
under a non encrypted channel and you
can check it out today in the link in
the video description or this thing here
piao m / pages / - - tech dot - tips

I wasn't even informed anyone sitting
here
was gonna be here until like the
beginning of this week and then I only
knew you were gonna be here until today
so I'm actually quite excited to talk
about that earlier actually new for
three months yeah communication around
these parts is just absolutely fantastic
yeah I thought I knew how to open or
close an iMac Oh was that his whole okay
yeah you realize I've had employees to
like put those back together for the
past five years figure it out yeah grab
the board and go click and he goes the
whole thing oh yeah when I was just
other I don't think it's fitting in the
game I just push it hard got anxiety
watch you guys work on that iMac I
turned around and sat down on the wall I
didn't even like I was out of sight
because I was getting anxious watching I
gave him the same service that I give
every customer that's the that's the
best ad I think I've ever heard oh it's
like a nice store manager come to me and
say can you stop like showing cuss me
ting the letters that customers write on
screen because I'll be sitting there
fixing a board and I'll go oh this
Thunderbolt doesn't look good viewing
are the other USB circuit looks messed
bent that we can always put that stuff
back on you don't really need that and
I'm saying it's kind of a joke cuz I'm
gonna get rid of that circuit and I'll
put it back on once it turns on but
there'll be people watching going all
them and say is that my on the screen
[Laughter]
that's fantastic why is everyone
spamming numbers I don't understand I'm
just gonna mass ban people oh you people
type F I don't know what that's done
either that is f is pay respects right
yeah yeah people keep doing this so
that's that's a Call of Duty mean where
you you like walk up to I believe
they're lowering the coffin of your like
friend into the ground your your friend
and fellow soldier and you like you have
to press F on your keyboard there's a
time bar first back what is f I think F
is just like it's like an easy macro key
so if your fingers are on like waa yeah
yeah you can well usually the to
interact keys in a game on a computer is
easy and I've never played : Oh
everyone's spamming f i thought everyone
is doing numbers and I was like alright
I'm just gonna go start banning people
but you know what f is okay is it cuz
the stream died no it's just not showing
here this is okay yeah my eyes aren't
great so I'm like trying to monitor the
chat for me good enough internet that
you could watch your own stream while
you're streaming it that's on two
different devices oh yeah you're
experience New York Internet I'm so
sorry if somebody if I play this dream
while I'm watching it I'll get dropped
frames this guy from Rush actually made
me a little plugin for open broadcaster
it'll save this many frames stolen by
Time Warner and it'll go up and it
matches the open broadcaster cow why is
internet in New York pad oh it's real
bad we've done news stories on it it's
so controlled it's such like there's so
many little agreements from all the
little ayats piece there that they don't
compete with one another that there's
basically no service or infrastructure
upgrades last 15-20 years you'll either
have Verizon DSL in my location which is
three megabit down and point seven
megabit up or you get to power which is
20 megabit up half the time for four
hundred nine plus tax the hotel I'm
staying at
don't tell him Stanton return right now
it gives me point six down point one up
I went to upload a video today using the
connection upstairs and I thought oh it
says six minutes remaining I must have
uploaded the wrong file
everybody go by itself and it's like no
that's 18 gigabytes and it says six
minutes remaining
like at home it'll say yeah 14 hours
your video will be yeah wow that's weird
cause like we have I couldn't operate
Australia's horrible for internet and
I've been learning that doing the
floatplane stuff that I've been doing
speaking of which sponsor spot flow
playing calm heck yeah scrappy Wars this
weekend kay I'm done
but it's like even just getting servers
like renting a server and Australia's
ludicrously expensive because the
Internet's so crazy expensive and Canada
has a similar problem of one of the
problems that Australia has which is
large landmass not a ton of people they
also have the problem of being kind of
isolated and kind of
the main path of mostly undersea cables
but Canada's problem were all extremely
spread out we all of Canada has less
population than just the state of
California and then a massive country so
you put those two together it's not a
really great combination luckily we're
all mostly nestled leaving it's like
cities that dot around the country it's
like Vancouver itself does pretty well
this place has 1,000 down 1,000 up my
house my like random suburbia house has
fiber 150 down 150 up oh and I pay
significantly less than you do 409 a
month is like taxes 409 a month for what
460 ft it's 20 megabit up 300 mega bit
down but the 20 megabit up it's like
sometimes 20 sometimes 10 sometimes five
sometimes I actually had to get Verizon
DSL along with the Time Warner because
the Time Warner goes down so often that
I got a PF sense router that will
automatically switch over to the hundred
dollar-a-month Verizon DSL when it dies
so that I can still process credit cards
Wow that's pretty typical for New York
yeah I expect the Time Warner that cost
409 a month to go down often enough that
it's worth it to have another so a
connection like me my studios in the
greater LA area and I've got 300 by 300
fiber $4.99 it's pretty yeah I'm paying
I believe it's 99 but I had like a
signing bonus lowered for a temporary
period of time thing for a while now for
my wonderful there's a new construction
a little bit like 30 minutes south of
where I live and there were big old
billboards as they were like you know
getting the land ready that it's gonna
be it was a fiber community or gigabit
community and it's like it was like 59
bucks a month the other thing is on the
commercial side so like a lot of
commercial internet is often much worse
than residential Internet at the lower
tier just because frogs in the Time
Warner in those companies they want at
least $2,500 a month for the internet
connection even if the companies like
and they try and guarantee that 99.9%
uptime which is absolutely yeah
[Laughter]
point-9 uh you know I've had to put a
sign up on the door enough times it's a
cash-only no internet yeah
that is so aggravating when you know
that you're spending over $450 on it I
was gonna say with both of those
internet connections that's the same oh
right
is this local the LTX only or can you
buy this stuff online
none of it okay so if you're watching
this and are going to be at LTX nice
little combo you can get a tech linked
pin and LTX lanyard which has like some
actually pretty cool graphing stuff on
it a little quick disconnect thing at
the back my this shirt which I've never
seen before
oh yeah I have this is pretty cool this
is just like a straight-up Linus tech
tips shirt what okay okay this one's one
of my favorite I don't really understand
why we did this but I think it's awesome
it's it's one of the editors so this is
one of the editors Dennis just making a
face on a shirt it's great I I
personally love it but I can understand
how some people might think it's a
little little funky then I think we just
have to other yeah these this is the
Linus tech tips like circuit logo shirt
is we have different or alert edition
graphics being given out or being sold
LTS I believe so yeah this is another
one of the circuit designs I thought
there was another shirt as well but that
might have been only for the VIP people
I'm not really sure but yeah you can buy
cool shirts at LTX if you are watching
this and going to be there and didn't
notice that you could buy shirts and
happen to see this there we go
best ad spot ever yeah also gonna say
next one thing that I want to get
through I think we we might have time is
because I always find this quite
interesting and wool again actually
we'll switch it we'll go through this
way over what got you into computers and
technology in general my dad my dad
after the military he was a project man
he was one of the he was one of the
first I was a pioneers but he was a VP a
senior VP for a company that was
building mainframes and and doing you
know crazy old school tape drive backups
and stuff and he basically talked to the
company it was like guys we need to get
off the mainframe and we need to get
into computer product management
computer based stuff PC stuff and this
was back in like 79 80 and they didn't
listen to him and of course the company
went belly-up because they were one of
the leaders in the mainframe and they
were almost getting off the mainframe
and but he so when when that happened he
ended up going to business for himself
writing project management software and
from my earliest memories I was always
on his lap while he was on the computer
doing his thing and he had know that he
said the best thing he ever did for me
was when I would try and touch the
computer he never was like no no don't
touch don't touch he was always like he
would save his work and she'd be like
have fun just type away and mash on the
keyboards so he never once told me I
couldn't touch anything right so I've
always done that with my kids okay it's
kind of gone you know three generation
or two generations at this point now my
youngest daughter now is she's three and
a half and showing interest in the
computer which is I think it's fantastic
sure so yeah it was it was just my dad
and that was just life was computers and
remember it's that simple I think I've
told my story a million times so I'll do
a very brief version of it but I just
wanted to play Diablo and the computer
stopped working
so I learned how to fix it so I could
keep playing Diablo and it's gone from
there there's there's longer versions
but you've probably heard it a million
times it's I don't really I mean I don't
really know where to start
there was a Finder is kind of
interesting because you were like super
in the middle of nowhere right yeah I
was super in the middle the first event
really that led to that was there was
this old guy and well I was sort of
bored in school and they were trying to
figure out how to do deal with that
because it was like kindergarten or
first grade or something and there was
an old guy visiting from the Stevens
Institute and he's like alright let's
figure this out so we set up an apple -
- with like a wooden break to measure
your reaction time when like
you hit the thing wood there was like a
basic program that would run and tell
you what your reaction time was for like
breaking in a car and so he walked me
through soldering wires into something
inside the Apple 2 and then riding a
program on the Apple 2 and doing all the
stuff and was like I have to learn more
and so you were in kindergarten a great
one I was very young yeah that's quite
an offensive project cuz I like took
everything apart I got in trouble for
taking apart like the TV and yeah and in
school which is what led to this okay I
needed a machine to work on some
sessions and Logic Pro and the studio
that I was working at it closed down so
I bought a MacBook because I was broke
he used on eBay and it can't arrive
broken I got a discount on it so I
bought the screen that I needed to fix
it and then when I didn't need it
anymore I sold it and I realized I made
a profit of two or three hundred dollars
so I thought let me do this again so I
was buying and reselling them for a
month or two then I wanted to start
offering the services to other people I
didn't think it was economically viable
but then I realized the part is 80 to 90
dollars an Apple charges twelve hundred
at the time to replace the entire screen
assembly so I just kept doing that over
and over again people started bringing
liquid damaged ones eventually so I
started sending them off to a company in
China that would fix them they were
doing worse and worse job as time went
on so I figured if I've been working on
recording studio equipment in consoles
component-level let me see if I can
figure out how to do this so after a lot
of I think a few years of painfully
messing around and failing a lot and
recording a lot of it for YouTube yeah I
got decent enough at it that I could
offer it's a regular costumers in that
was that I think the YouTube thing
started from making a video because
reseller ratings was trying to up the
rate by about a thousand percent so I
did a video on their process that got
120,000 views that I thought would get
ten that was that cool and you've
mentioned audio stuff a few times this
way in show so what what was your
involvement in the music industry I
worked at avid I went to Avatar studios
and I said that I would remember saying
something like I would rather wash the
toilets here than work at any other
place for money and I remember I showed
up for my interview and the guy asked
what is this thing that I have in my
pocket and it was a si muy headphone
amplifier that I put together myself
from stuff that I bought on eBay and he
said you're hired
I think that was Roy Hendrickson
so I worked there and I clean the
toilets and I clean the you know all the
floors and the consoles and everything
for three months and then I after
working there for free after three
months I got to work in the tech room
with the other people working on SSL
consoles and eve consoles do we tape
machines and that was that cool sweet it
was fun I think with that we are oh no
we have about 10 minutes left let's see
if there's any actual topics to talk
about
no topics no turns out recycling garbage
in like the poor part of the thing
that's also a really good way to get
technology that's how I got most of my
first computers it's like let's
Frankenstein stuff together I think I
feel like most people that are into
computers have a similar story that like
my favorite one is I went to a like a
country high school we didn't have very
much money especially not in the tech
departments and the way that we built a
new computer lab because we need to run
really badly because there's a lot of
kids in the school that we're interested
in computers it was just designed as a
country's closest and most trades and
stuff the way we built a new computer
lab was my teacher waited for the truck
that went to all the different schools
and picked up all their broken computers
because they did it once every like few
years and called him the guy directly I
don't know how you got his number and
diverted him to our school which I
really what he wasn't planning to go to
because we had no computers to give up
and he was like yeah we got some stuff
just like leave the truck for a little
while and he left the truck and we
offloaded everything that was on there
which was like not supposed to happen
I'm not gonna say your name but thank
you very much teacher because I think
the hard drives and stuff that were on
there yeah but we took everything we
shoved it all in one room and then my
teacher was just like okay bye thank you
leave now and we spent the next few
months that whole computer class just
like we would lay out like oh my
goodness okay this motherboard actually
works let's find all the CPUs and all
the RAM and everything that can go into
this board and test all of it and mark
everything is good or bad and like find
all the use those to find all the
motherboards that work and like don't
remove Allah and we go to building like
one and a half computer labs out of it
that was a really really cool project a
lot of fun we had a I was accused by the
time I made it to high school I was
accused of black magic because the local
repair place would always replace the
motherboard whenever a ps2 remember a
kid with something the ps2 ports were
really
that is like if you pulled the keyboard
the wrong way and blow the fuse on the
motherboard and so it was not surface
mount it was through-hole it's really
easy to replace and I would be like well
let's just crack it open take the
motherboard out and replace the the
through-hole fuse and the local computer
repair company was like black magic
witchcraft burn him burn him at the
stake is green we can replace the
motherboard we can't just repair them
that that's like three cents we can't do
it so yeah that was not fun in a poor
high school or they can't afford a
thousand bucks a machine to replace
stuff and you I'm just I don't know why
I'm jumping back to this now I kind of
skimmed over it when you were first
telling the story but you built a
amplifier you said it was a seam line
means they have all these guides in line
of how to build them it's a headphone
amplifier that you build into an Altoid
skin that's powered off a 9-volt battery
so what got you into that though I just
enjoyed hi-fi audio okay yeah yeah so
you wanted like kind of build something
yeah just thought it was something cool
to do in my spare time and I've seen it
if I remember correctly you have those
like the I'm gonna use the wrong term
but the sound dampening panels yeah
panels yeah yeah in my office and at all
yeah are you still into custom hi-fi
stuff yeah yeah cool what's what's like
the most recent custom IFI project you
done I like just the van der Steen set
of speakers that I have at home you
really don't need really expensive stuff
to make it sound good
you can find you stuff online like van
der Steen speakers for $400 the cheap
amplifier and some of those Corning 7:03
panels and it'll sound amazing yeah I've
actually been for a while now I've
wanted to copy your your sound dampening
panel project you just can't have a cat
because if you have a cat then they use
it as a scratching post they've made it
an entire section of my apartment look
like garbage the cat is cute silicates
away
hey you worked a nightie for quite a
while I had several hats in that company
but I worked very close well I started
actually doing energy audits and stuff
within the company and we also wrote our
own software to run on various devices
either iPads or the Samsung device as I
mentioned and we had major contract with
the power companies and then our IT
department was extremely overworked and
supporting all these devices upgrade
'i'm gettin ready to go repairing
and we also had our in-house a software
development team and then the more they
realized that I was the guy that was
actually going around in the field
helping other people field people so get
a problem you to call in to the helpdesk
right and our helpdesk was three guys
trying to support a company at three
hundred and fifty field agents and it
was just like that could get overworked
really easy yeah and that was the same
our IT department of three was the same
guys also building and managing our
three countrywide six major cities VPN
that kept all of our offices and
communications so if they were doing
that or they were out at a data center
or something we were just like down in
person yeah so I was the guy that
everyone started calling out in the
field to come help them if they had tech
problems with their equipment or
somebody was broken needs it fixed when
the company realized I was doing that
then they were like hey you want to
manage our helpdesk and I was like I
don't know we'll see so because they
knew I had all the end-user experience
as well as the technical know-how to
keep it all working well once I got into
that role they realized I also knew an
okay amount of coding and design from my
dad being approached a software
developer so then they were like you
want to be a part of our QC QA team and
be a part of our automated testing and
I'm like wait you want me to do helpdesk
management and this so basically I ended
up having like these three hats at one
time which really burned me out to be
almost as I did that for almost 10 years
right and then that was when I started
doing UT thing and just kind of moved
out of there but it was fun I learned a
lot obviously it was unique to have this
kind of a Venn diagram of experience all
three of those aspects you know
development support and then end user
which really gave me a unique
understanding of what it's like from top
to bottom when it comes to product
testing and and use yeah so I try and
take everything from a very practical
perspective of how I approach tech but I
do have a very high level knowledge to
on where a lot of it starts and I but I
try not to really go into any of that in
my content because I leave stuff for
that like Wendell and gamers Nexus yeah
the guys who can actually communicate
that in a manner which people can
understand because I'm very good at
practical use but I'm very bad at
technical explanation okay so and I'm
gonna take something that you said and
something that you explained
but so you you got into YouTube because
you wanted to kind of express annoyance
from who was it customary celebrating
Greece already being so calm and you
mentioned that you started to get into
YouTube at that time but why did you
start to get into YouTube it was a dare
Oh someone dared me um so I was lighting
yeah well I was live-streaming Call of
Duty 3 close couple quarters when it
launched because Nick coconut monkey and
I were good friends and we played that
all the time and I'd started
live-streaming it because when when it
dropped for premium access early access
he was like with a family on vacation he
couldn't play it to his all butthurt so
I basically was like okay I'll find out
how to stream it so you can watch it and
see the early access another gentleman
by the name of holiday doc came in and
just randomly found my stream and he was
a pretty well known like Call of Duty
Cod caster for like a MLG and he just
thought that I was funny and
entertaining and we became friends and
after a couple of months he's like you
should do YouTube people would find like
this tech stuff interesting because I
became like the guy he asked PC
questions to he didn't know anything
about disease and then he was like you
should do stuff like this on youtube I
said and I and at the time I didn't know
but Linus tech tips I didn't know people
made livings on YouTube I was this is
2012 I was super ignorant to what was
going on I was like who the heck would
watch a channel about computers that
sounds like the most boring thing anyone
would ever spend their time doing he's
like well just try it so he I basically
told him I'll try it but what it fails
will you leave me alone he kept bugging
me about doing it and so I was like fine
I'll try it and then of course it just
sort of steadily took off and that sense
like built in a computer it sent in
parts yeah it's it's one of those things
where I only did it to show that it
would not work
yeah and fast-forward six years it's now
my life it's not incorporated and it's
now helping other people pay their bills
cuz now I have employees so it's crazy I
that's that's actually really cool and I
like the part where you sent him but
yeah you're in parts and stuff that's
gonna cool the payback I I got into
YouTube because I was like really really
into mechanical keyboards like before
America really had very many mechanic
that's not rare at the
like really into that yes it there's
there's forums dedicated to and stuff
it's just not that big of a community
and I had like I had my own like
imported from Taiwan keyboard and all
kind of stuff and I wanted to show it
off because I was proud that I finally
actually gone a mechanical rightward
instead of just researching them online
all the time so I filmed the video of
that and then never released it and now
there's some people of watching this
have probably seen it but there's a
video of Linus and I watching that video
both just essentially me oh yeah because
that was when I was like critiquing your
first video like my people were doing
that yeah yeah yeah so we we critiqued a
video that no one had seen cuz it was
never released anywhere right so that
that directors commentary thing we were
talking about like as its airing and
then you're so embarrassed cuz like oh
my god believe I said that
yeah you think like you nailed this
video you go back and you little you're
like wow especially because I said
something that was like factually
incorrect what was your first mechanical
keyboard DK 9008 g2 from ducky let's see
I mean duckies a mouse it's still the
keyboard that I yes
my first was a razer blackwidow oh yeah
okay I mean nothing super special but it
was a blue switch with that that was
super cool until I started streaming I
still carry with it my or bust is what I
do okay I'll get a black model in
actually actually that's cool a fairly
impressive collection of the SSK model
amps as well the numpad less ones yeah I
have a match I should be able to make it
at all them about 80 if I only use the
SS case okay that's pretty sweet
I'm oh and yeah you know comp still
makes them all win but it's a little
wider it's not it's nice a mention yeah
the the earlier ones that are better the
lighter ones I've got a lot of money
from like the healthcare industry and
stuff so you know comp is making higher
quality products and they were even a
couple of years ago and they're it's
almost as good but man those assets like
it's nice the other thing I really miss
is are the extra keys so I've had to
like remap my keys for things on the
right side of the keyboard it's not bad
yeah I have one properly functioning
model and but I generally don't use it
I've got a bunch of the ones with a num
lock you can totally have one I would
like the number pad yeah yeah that's
fine
having cool
I can even give you new inbox I've got
like four of those of like the original
yeah holy cow that would be pretty cool
but how did you get into YouTube the
very first video that I made was
actually even before the thing like I
used well that's a long story but even
before all of that there is a video that
I'm surprised that no one found and it
was when Windows Vista came out I was so
angry I probably should have been
medicated and I was really worried about
privacy and things like that
but I made a driver showing how Nvidia
had completely screwed the pooch on
64-bit drivers under 64-bit Vista they
literally took their 32-bit driver and
pasted it into a 64-bit raw wrapper I
was so mad I could not see straight I
was seething with anger because it was
like you know right up to the beta
launching video was like written come
out with a driver and then after Vista
went into production they were like okay
cool here's our real driver and it was
still the same garbage that had been
better like the last six months before
that and so there's a video on youtube
of me losing my mind and ranting about
this horrible pile of garbage driver
that doesn't work and it'll work for
five minutes and then crash and the
whole reason was that as soon as the
program would try to do anything outside
of the 32-bit address space with that
64-bit driver it would crash because it
wasn't really a 64-bit driver so there's
that and that's the very first thing I
did on YouTube technically I guess yeah
if I want to be specific the very first
stuff I did on YouTube was again this is
the only reason why I thought of it even
I usually forget about this but you
mentioned no one found it so far no one
has found this I checked a little while
ago and it was still there I don't know
why the titles are so bad it's probably
why people can't find it but no
clickbait here but uh this was I used to
do guides on how to get 100% sink in
like Assassin's Creed levels like no one
cared that's great
so what another thing I want to ask you
about is you recently developed and
started selling why am I forgetting the
name of them right now hey bu yes
yeah like multi-port kvms with really
really really high-end features so that
was another thing
was made me almost as mad but not quite
as mad as the Nvidia driver II thing
that's why I brought it up it was like
alright I can do something about this
that I can fix because the world of kvms
for like 4k and like DisplayPort 60
Hertz it's terrible it's really terrible
and most I know of even now are still
like VGA stuff yeah yeah and like the
USB functionality is like it's designed
for like the five dollar a USB keyboard
which has like one of three of the
cheapest USB chips don't come an but if
you get an RGB keyboard it doesn't work
or if you've got like the Corsair
keyboards once the driver looks like
it's not even really a keyboard anymore
and so good luck getting that to work
with a KVM and so I just I found I found
somebody in Taiwan that had basically
the hardware that I needed but I got
them to tweak the hardware for me and I
got to do software that solves the
problems for people like us that would
be trying to do things with a KDM that
has you know a 4k display for 1.2
whatever and I basically already had a
customer lined up for them so I was just
sort of selling the seconds but they
sold so well that we did two other runs
and it is shocking the people that have
come out of the woodwork to buy the kvms
and generally it's done really well
interestingly Mac's are the things that
have the biggest problem like I could
the trash can Mac Pro's don't actually
follow the DisplayPort spec at all no
yeah so it's the most surprised no way
I've ever little problematic with Mac's
of the modern max you have to use like a
thunderbolt dock that has like a
DisplayPort socket you can't just use a
cheap cable I don't know what that's
about so I'm looking I'm working on that
yeah I know that the every MacBook with
the since the touch bar with the dongle
if you use a dongle it's not the Apple
dongle your devices won't work yeah it's
a rolled I plan to do a real review of
that and once I got to the point where I
plugged it in and I realized the dongle
didn't work unless you use the $80.00
one and the $30 one worked and the two
other machines I had been stopped by
well the one of the design choices on
the KVM is that it does not have a
repeater and so a lot of the signal is
like a lot of the signal out of that
DisplayPort cable is just barely enough
that if it's going into
the monitor it's fine but if you send it
in through the connector and then into
the KVM which is like another four
inches of cable and then back out again
the signal noise ratio is not high
enough for it to do a proper digital
sync or whatever on that cable and it's
infuriating because the spec says they
should be able to push an unamplified
cable that's like eight meters or
something like that and if you're lucky
to get four I'd be interested in what
chipsets the the trashcan one uses
because I think I've only open one of
those immigrants it's a d3 hundred but
it goes through I think it goes through
the board in the bottom and then back
out the connector in the back and so
they have a repeater or something in the
board in the bottom and that's the
problem yeah because if I like just
solder a little dongle directly on the
d300 it's fine so you'd have to tell
your customers they're coming to the
neck yeah it's some some of the
witchcraft
after the d 300 before it makes it out
of the mattress on the centrally and
required yeah the you mentioned the like
I think there's like four inches or
whatever of cable within the within the
box that was a I'm gonna tangent here a
fair amount but that was a really
interesting situation when USB three
start first are becoming popular and
you'd have those cases that have front
i/o USB three but that were just cable
extensions that would go all the way out
the back bug into the back of your
motherboard and then you'd have people
with really long USB three cables so you
have people with like fifteen feet worth
of total actual distance for USB three
and then it won't charge their frickin
devices that remains a problem on cases
front panel USB 3 is still yeah it's
it's it's it's frustrating to when you
were finally in the era where it isn't
those weird extensions that have to go
out the case and then into the
motherboard in order to make it so you
can plug in USB but they some cases will
still have us be just like header cables
yeah four USB three that you could plug
into a different case like it's like why
is it so long this is actually really
bad but yeah most people will don't know
about that that being said though I
think we're gonna cut it here because
you have to grab a plane I have a flight
yeah yes to get out of here thanks for
watching the wine show this was a bit of
a bit of a different way to do the wine
show we half covered one topic but I
think it was good it was fun to talk
about a whole bunch of different stuff
I'm gonna let people shout out their
Chan
again so lewis Rossman group Lopez the
two S's to Angeles is to end level one
text JC sense perfect there we go
I will see you guys next week I will
possibly see you guys at LTX I'm gonna
Joyce more this Evan I'll be there too
mom
do it
daddy
yay private Internet access for all your
privates
yeah LTX I need to get chilling scenes
in open broadcaster dude that's great
that's great I have to do it manually it
sucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
