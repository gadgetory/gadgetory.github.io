at a motherboard from EVGA so this is
part of their refreshed series of x58
boards so this is the x58 for the win
three and the three means a couple of
things we'll get into that a little bit
more later first of all like I said this
is the next 58 board that means it
supports all Intel Core i7 processors
both in the extreme and regular variety
so four cores six cores you name it it
uses the x58 Express chipset and it's
nvidia sli as well as AMD crossfire
ready on the back we're gonna find an
outline of the various features that
it's includes but I actually don't need
this list I'm gonna go ahead and figure
that out as we go along because
motherboards are not that difficult for
me I've done quite a few motherboard
unboxings over the last little while so
I like to think I know my way around a
motherboard
I like to think anyway I could be wrong
it's happened before it's happened a lot
of times if you follow my videos Wow
anyway here we go first thing we find
when we open up the box is a little note
from EVGA
he says please note if your product is
not working properly do not return to
the store EVG offers direct customer
service you can call us here and that
would be a good thing okay so what we're
gonna find inside in terms of
accessories we find a little x58 for the
win three motherboard layout
thingamajigger along with the QuickStart
guide tells us how to install a graphics
card how to install a CPU RAM power
supply all that good stuff covers the
basics you got full color there oh yeah
and it's even got started some more
detailed stuff on the back so how to
plug things into the back how to plug in
your front
i case switches good stuff alright next
we have an EVGA sticker EVGA 3-way SLI
sticker cool so I guess this board
supports 3-way SLI that was easy that's
maybe that's part of the off for the win
3 alright next we've got another board
installation guide that's sort of a more
book shaped version of the other one we
just looked up alright in terms of
cables we have
molex to SATA power cables we have six
SATA data cables and then we have an IDE
cable so from there we can not presume
that the board does support IDE
we also have a USB firewire PCI back
bracket we have a 3-way SLI bridge we
have a two-way SLI bridge that's a
floppy bridge this is a PCB inflexible
bridge we have a IO cover alright and
finally we have a disk that you should
throw away next we have the motherboard
itself
which looks oh man EVGA does such a
great job of the aesthetics for their
boards just phenomenal
it smells like fresh motherboard - you
guys know what I'm talking about please
leave a comment under the video saying
that you also appreciate the smell of
fresh motherboard because it's very
noticeable ok why don't we start up here
we'll start at the top left so first
thing we've got is our 8 pin CPU power
connector we have only one on this board
although that's not to say that the
board can't provide a whole lot of juice
to the CPU we've gone one two three four
but we've got what appears to be a plus
two phase power delivery to the CPU and
one of the things that I noticed right
away about this board is that the CPU is
located I'm not quite and not as much in
the center but very high up near the top
edge of the board so you're gonna want
to watch out if you have a top mounted
power supply and a very large heatsink
you might actually get a little bit of
interference going on there so watch out
for that although it does have quite a
spacious area around the socket so if
you're installing a big cooler and you
don't have something like right here
above your board you should be just fine
we've got support for it six ddr3 dimms
so that's a triple channel memory up to
24 gigs lots and lots of memory
supported by this particular board then
we've got our 24 pin power connector and
it's ideal location along the right-hand
edge of the board and moving down we
have an IDE connector as well as here's
another reason it's called three that is
a SATA 3 six gigabit per second pair of
ports so there's two SATA 3 6 gig per
second ports and then 6 SATA 2 3 gigabit
per second ports right
there here we have a couple of really
are those USB Wow but they're red
very strange okay we have red USB
headers we have a self bridge heatsink
as well as a Northbridge heatsink which
is looks like it's made up of a couple
different components so there's a bit of
an under plate here that's using like a
black anodized finish and then we've got
some nice big fins here that look like
there's got to be some way to install a
fan on there but it looks like the board
is passively cooled by default coming
from EVGA so I guess if it can run that
way then awesome so much the better
we've gone our front header connectors
here for the power LEDs all that good
stuff we got a couple fins and I'll show
you all the fans in a minute because it
looks like this board supports a lot of
fans next we've got a clear CMOS button
here although there's another one on the
back rendering this one pretty much
useless we also have integrated power
and reset switches as well as lots of
PCIe expansion slots we've got a total
of four PCIe slots two PCI slots so you
can run up to 3-way SLI although if you
do run 3-way SLI and you're running dual
slot cards and if you're running 3-way
SLI you better be running dual slot
cards if you're running 3-way SLI with
dual slot cards you won't be able to
install anything else however if you are
running 2-way SLI then you will have
access either to an additional PCIe 16x
or a PCI or an additional PCI 16x and an
additional PCI so here we go three PCIe
16x 2 PCI 1 PCIe 1x although the odds of
being able to access that one are pretty
slim given you probably have a dual slot
graphics card here ok what else is there
to say about this let's go back over I
like this you know what it's little
touches that some guys do right and some
guys don't on the back of the board look
at this screws
okay these are spring-loaded screws
mounting these Southbridge heatsink the
Northbridge heatsink which is up here as
well as the mosfet heatsink nice little
touch because we're not using cheapo
push pins we're using something that's
going to stick something that's going to
last and also something that can be
easily removed if you want to take the
whole thing off and now the waterblock
on it safe
example if you were into that sort of
things okay so let's have a look at the
back of the board where we are going to
find the final three thing that is USB
3.0 so we have two USB 3 ports we have 8
USB 2 ports 1 ps2 keyboard part a clear
CMOS I'm at a loss for this one so I'll
be back in a second and then we also
have two Gigabit Ethernet ports one
firewire as well as seven point one
audio sorry guys that's the evbot
connector so sorry about that anyway
thank you for checking out the unboxing
