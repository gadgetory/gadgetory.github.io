our editing workstations together so
those are like core i7 six cores and GTX
Titans then we're gonna take that water
we're gonna dig it out of the building
and then we're gonna put that on a
massive radiator so we're actually
taking all that heat and dissipating it
outside causing not only our systems to
run cooler but also our room in which we
do our work to be cooler well the whole
actual goal of the whole room water
cooling project was to cool down the
room where you could have done a much
cheaper and easy solution of actually
installing a like a seat unit but
instead we've decided to go along with
this how effective will it actually be
not hugely but hopefully it'll help a
little bit and be really clean sant√© one
system in particular was the main
inspiration for this project and that's
ed Zoe's machine which had a couple of
problems number one is that the system
itself was always overheating because he
always had his six core processor pinned
at a hundred percent so they were
kicking out a bunch of heat into his
quite inadequate CPU cooler which was
then not keeping his CPU cool enough so
problem number one was that his system
was actually overheating so much like
8090 sometimes even above 90 degrees but
it was thermal throttling and he wasn't
even getting all the performance out of
it and then problem number two was that
the person sitting in front of it was
constantly complaining about the heat in
the room so with the whole room water
cooling setup we can cool a system make
it more powerful because we got a 12
core Xeon for it and make that person
complain less by making the room cooler
you know originally I hadn't planned to
paint the room the project is gonna be
much smaller scale and I was gonna be
just about liquid cooling the machines
but I realized that if we're gonna take
the room apart clean it up presumably
and pull all the systems out of it well
this is a great opportunity to take it
from a place where we all sit at our
computers and work and turn that into
like a really cool workspace that really
feels like - tech tips make it feel like
like home and like
place that's really cool to be and work
on our craft in the hot
it's a lot that's why what look at
that's on the side yeah fortunately
really oh my god yeah this is terrible
so I drew upon my experience painting
houses and training painters to get that
done in kind of a Linus tech tips gray
and then as much as I've got a fair bit
of painting experience I'm a little bit
rusty and I have some experience
training people who have never painted
before but Nick has really never painted
before keeping the quality level up was
a bit of a challenge as well Nick did
his best though and between the two of
us we managed to get the whole job done
although by the second coat I did pretty
much most of it myself since it was you
know the second coat is when you clean
up the mistakes from the first coat a
lot of the time
finishing the first coat of paint was
really nice I was able to put down the
roller and kind of step back and go yeah
this is starting to look really cool and
I wanted to kind of turn to my sides and
say hey guys don't you think this is
great but I realized everyone was gone
so I wandered downstairs and found out
that while I was painting instead of
everyone else kind of proactively
figuring out how we can move the project
forward they were doing arts and crafts
and making a shield for Luke and pinning
buttons to turn his shirt into like
Impala button and armor all that might
have been okay at least they had done a
decent job of thinking I am cleaning
over everyone's old drives so that when
they get their new computers
it'll be like using the same drive so
Brandon can have his viruses which he
refused to take care of
Terry can have all his slow unoptimized
drives and everything and we don't have
to reinstall anything or waste any time
freaking Taryn this whole time has been
telling me that system and that his slow
boot is unrelated
that's Terrans Drive I wonder what the
slowness of his computer's been about
dammit I'm having a pile of like cases
and graphics cards and I mean even the
water cooling gear alone was a pile like
having this mountain of a hardware that
was actually at like as tall as me was
really made me better understand the
scope of what we were undertaking so
apparently the project was pushed up a
day I actually had no idea was not told
by anyone but that seems to kind of be a
lioness Media Group thing there's like
you have to do this at some point in
time somehow no one knows no one's gonna
be helping you and we're not really sure
when but you won't have enough time so
just make sure you do it really quickly
like this actually gets finished before
we move on to something else well it
turned out Linus didn't actually check
the specs for the radiators before he
bought them so when I tried to mount it
on the top there's fittings that would
be on the bottom of it that then pressed
against the top of the case so I put it
up on an angle and you couldn't actually
get screws all the way through the fan
the top of this case and past the
fitting and into the radiator so I had
to drill holes in the top which was
fantastic thank you thank you please so
Luke actually ended up having to drill
holes for each of the radiators before
we could even start assembling the
systems that took up a ton of his time
that otherwise he would have been able
to spend helping me build systems it got
to the point where we actually had to
recruit Ezell to help us build computers
even though his system building
experience is not really that much hey
it was pretty nice to me thanks no one
was mostly painless the next one should
be the second involvement all right and
then it was pretty much time to water
cool the systems something that I ended
up doing the vast majority of myself so
that's getting the tubing on the
fittings for the CPU and GPU block
running it outside of the case and then
at that point I handed them off to Ed
who was the one who actually figured out
how the fittings worked for the pic
disconnects to install the the quick
disconnects at the back on both the top
radiator as well as the tubing coming
out of the inside of the case installing
everything in the systems was a
monumental task and everyone had to chip
in in ways that they haven't really done
before I even had Edsel helping me
assemble GPU water blocks onto the Titan
cards because that can be very
time-consuming and I needed to move on
to the next thing that I could do when
Luke was drilling holes in cases so we
had to parallelize the workflow a lot
just to account for how time-consuming
everything was going to be well because
I'm the plumber I deal with this sort of
situation of soldering copper together
and dealing with PEX lines and different
fittings
for myself I would say maybe a to the
typical homeowner or person that would
try to tackle this on themselves would
probably be closer to eight or nine
maybe even a Titch higher it all depends
on your skill levels this project after
I understood what they were wanting I
thought it was a very interesting
project
these are all what you called dry fat
just to see if everything fits in the
right places well and we'll hold it up
like that solder it then these are all
three inches apart three inches apart
nice and neat from December 13th to 20th
2014 you can save on select until CPU
Schnucks and SSDs with special holiday
rebates from select retailers click now
to learn more so we got the vinyl decals
in and they're actually pretty big huge
almost life-size for Linus
it is life-size we had to pay some guy
in the parking lot Oh three years yeah I
was just doing the exiting I think a
little bit of confusion was bound to
happen and I think overall we're a
little confused</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
