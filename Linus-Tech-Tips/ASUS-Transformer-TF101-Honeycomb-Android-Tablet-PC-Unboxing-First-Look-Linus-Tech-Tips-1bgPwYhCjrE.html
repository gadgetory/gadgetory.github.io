all the complications on my channel and
whatnot but I am finally unboxing the
asou a pad TF 101 transformer this is
the 16 gig model and I don't have the
keyboard on me today but I am still very
excited to bring you this unboxing
because even though everyone in their
dog has pretty much done it at this
point I have not yet and I am still
excited the one that I had before when I
did a little bit of content on the TF
101 that closer to launch was a demo
unit so I did not have a retail box I
could not share with you the retail box
unboxing experience the inside of the
box is black
very stylish ok
the product itself is there and now let
me move it the plastic that holds the
product is also black ah there's all the
accessories so let's have a look at the
accessories themselves the first thing
we find is a little epad paper
thingamajiggy holder it's a paper
holding they're finally managed to spin
it up we have a user's manual which is
obviously not very complete really
you're using android so what you're
gonna have to do is you're gonna have to
you know browse the forums try things
just try things because android what i
discovered was a little bit hard for me
to get into i spent a fair amount of
time with a motorola xoom over the last
little while and like doesn't feel quite
right at first but once you set it up
the way that you like it it's very very
natural to use and so this is Android
Honeycomb
a couple tips for using your iPad so
they show you how to use some of the
included things including the file
manager which allows you to use manage
your internal storage moveable devices
including the microSD port and removing
the external storage devices so there
you go there's a little icon there so
that's one of the more androids our
transformer specific ones you got a
charger cable here so that's just a USB
charger cable and you also have a wall
wart so you've got a power to USB power
adapter guy right there now the
transformer TF 101 itself actually let's
see what a Seuss has to say for itself
in terms of what they think are the best
features right off the bat here so 178
degrees now a Seuss makes they're not
shy about advertising that they are
using an IPS panel in here that is
covered with Gorilla Glass that is a
premium feature IPS panel means you not
only have better viewing angle so you
can pretty much see what's on the screen
even from way over here way over here
but you also have better color accuracy
regardless of where you're looking at it
from so that is a great feature
they also playing up to nine point five
hours of battery life and that is with
the screen at 60 minutes as I recall in
terms of brightness and playing back
720p video next SRS 3d stereo sound
don't bother coming in socal communities
so it does have stereo speakers and they
do have software on here that allows you
to in theory enjoy a surround sound but
my experience with those software
solutions in the past is that there's
that compelling I would still say though
that compared to something like an iPad
to having stereo speakers on the unit is
a definite plus that is a selling point
for sure because using the iPad 2 to
watch videos over the last little while
it's kind of annoyed me that it only has
one speaker and that the speaker is
hidden away on the back of the unit next
we have a ten finger multi-touch input
so you can potentially put both of your
hands on it and go like this should you
so decide if you want to like fruit
ninja it up and you're like ah I just
want to hit everything then you can use
all ten fingers if you want next you've
got a keyboard dock with USB and SD card
reader that is optional so that also
includes an extended battery like I said
I don't have that today but that does
use these latches right here as well as
this input in order to connect not only
the oh yeah no ice already said that the
USB SD card reader in the extended
battery as well as the keyboard and then
it folds up like a laptop and it also
acts as a case flash screen protector if
there's also 680 grams light really they
say six hundred and eighty grams light
well I would say it is 680 grams of
weight or 680 grams heavy but you know
everyone can interpret that the way they
desire so let me turn this baby on now
like the zoom which is one of the
tablets that I have more experience with
than this
particular one like the zoom the
transformer is intended to be used in
portrait mode so you can actually here
give me a second here grab my iPad so
like the zoom the transformer has its
webcam as well as its light sensor on
the top you can see that the logo here
is right-side up when you are holding it
in landscape mode so when you compare
that to something like an iPad 2 where
your camera's here Steve Jobs clearly is
expecting you to use the tablet more
like how you would use a traditional
notepad okay so actually you can see
that mine is locked in landscape mode
right now or you would be able to see
that if I could figure out how to unlock
it normally it's over here oh right
right because I set up the button so
yeah I like I didn't even know how to
get it to port to go into portrait mode
because I predominantly use it for
watching videos actually here's the
thing I complained about before where
the iPad 2 is only speakers on the back
which means that if you're watching
videos in a less than ideal environment
you are not going to be able to hear
very well so let's get back to the TF
101 it's running with a Tegra 2
processor this is so this is something I
haven't mentioned yet and this is a huge
advantage that a lot of the honeycomb
tablets running Tegra 2 have over
something like an Apple iPad so you have
way more 3d performance out of a Tegra 2
than you're gonna get out of any other
chip on the market now there aren't a
ton of games that take advantage of it
but the titles are rapidly rolling in so
even something like fruit ninja looks
better on Tegra 2 and I'm not even
kidding because the fruit will actually
be far more round and less polygon II
like this when you're when you're
slicing through I mean does it make a
huge difference to the gameplay
experience no but it's still kind of
cool that you do get better graphics
graphics out of the Tegra 2 platform now
in terms of a few more spec things
before I just finish up with the
physical look of the unit I've turned it
on now okay you've got a 1.2 megapixel
camera in the front the camera on the
back is a 5 megapixel camera and that is
also located in an ideal location for
landscape mode you store as you can see
once again on the iPad 2 is configured
more for portrait use
all right and I think that's pretty much
it actually okay so physical layout
let's have a look at the button so
here's our power button here on the side
this is a far more ideal location than
the one on the zoom in my opinion which
is on the back right here I don't bother
getting to closest okay I'm just showing
general things so on the side here it
means that when you're using it whether
you're using it like this or like this
you can you can kind of reach it whereas
when it's on the back it's very awkward
to reach up here it's not it's not
always not always comfortable so on the
top we don't have any buttons at all on
this side we've got a microphone port or
rather sorry headphone headphone /
microphone port so that can be used with
the with like a headset style device we
have a mini HDMI that is such a cool
feature mini HDMI is don't bother
getting too close it's okay mini HDMI is
great for playing games like like that
WaveRunner style game where basically
you can go like this and then you can
actually watch the big screen at the
same time so it does support 1080p
output over HDMI finally we have a micro
SD card so this is the big reason why
very few people are buying 32 gig
transformers because you can buy the 16
gig by yourself a cheapo microSD card
throw it in there and all of a sudden
you've got a bunch more storage now in
terms of the oh actually Gorilla Glass
what does that mean means you've got a
very durable piece of glass on the front
and on the back this is a huge complaint
I have about the iPad 2 so you can see
the back of my iPad 2 I've only had this
thing for about a month I've got a big
old scratch there that was actually from
sliding it across a granite countertop
just got just generally the back looks
totally grungy and horrible already the
back of the transformer I mean it's not
real attractive it's brown let's be
honest here but what it is is very
durable very scratch resistant I
guarantee you you know I'm gonna do this
I'm gonna take a brand new transformer
like this because I don't care because
the textured back the textured
appearance of the back is going to
really mask and really hide things like
fingerprints and small surface scratches
much better than most other surfaces
out there so thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the assist rants former
TF 101 don't forget to subscribe to
Lana's tech tips from on boxing's
reviews and other computer videos
sorry guys some clarification about the
speaker that's cameraman by the way
who's visiting us here he's going on to
lunch but I can't because I'm busy so
these are not the speakers sorry about
that that's just a textured pattern on
the side of the unit the speakers are
actually located here and here on the
other side so while that is
significantly better than being located
on the back it's still not going to give
you quite the sound performance of a
front mounted speaker actually I don't
know if any of these tablets have front
mounted speakers so I had originally
thought these were on the front they're
not so they're small correction sorry
guys one more note a soos also
advertises one year unlimited web
storage that comes with the TF 101 so
that's kind of cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
