affordable compact drone for the masses
without compromises to their signature
technologies and why shouldn't we
believe them
they've been dominating every other
drone segment from filmmakers to
industrial use to enthusiasts with over
a grand to burn but for all their noise
about the dawn of the age of the UAV or
whatever they've never had a product to
offer your mom grandpa or Lindsay yet
but does Lindsay even need a drone and
if she does is this the one she could
buy we don't really think so let me
explain
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel bear the simple VPN app starts
your seven day free trial at the link in
the video description let's get one
thing straight
while the spark borrows a lot from its
foldable Big Brother the ability to pick
color profiles and RAW images are both
missing it gets in practical terms half
the battery life of the Matic Pro and it
substitutes a third access on its gimbal
for digital stabilization restricting
video capture resolution to a measly
1080 Pease rather than 4000 k's so it's
not a baby Mavic pro but then does
Lindsay really need any of that stuff to
take selfies on the beach maybe not so
let's talk about things that she does
need like controls we've tried all the
different ways that you can interface
with the spark and all three of them
have come short of being ideal gesture
control is the flashiest most party
trick like among them promising to allow
you to launch the drone raise it lower
it move it away and towards you take a
selfie follow you around and even come
back and land gracefully on your
outstretched palm without an additional
controller the idea here is outstanding
having a portable flying camera that
behaves kind of like a well-trained dog
is a future that I could really get into
but we feel like DJI could have done a
better job of setting realistic
expectations to enter gesture mode you
power up the drone then once it's booted
up you double click the power button
flash at your biggest smile and it takes
off reasonably intuitive so far but
that's where things break down a little
bit between using the force to move the
spark to the right position doing this
instead of something more like this or
like this or I don't know like this to
take a selfie
and the fact that the spark communicates
back to the user exclusively through
blinking lights in ways that only the
most obsessive weirdos are going to
actually memorize before attempting to
use their new toy and that depend on the
context we end up with an experience
that was actually stressful or even a
little bit scary at times the spark has
a battery of sensors but in gesture mode
anyway it's kind of like your weird
uncle who knows that you're there but
doesn't seem to really understand your
personal boundaries and this is only
amplified by how twitchy the sparks
light is along with how easy it is for
it to lose track of where you are it
really makes me wonder how they can even
be touting this as a flying selfie stick
or even a tripod substitute ignoring how
obnoxious it would actually be to pull
out a drone and fly it to take a family
portrait at your next gathering as for
touch screen control well it's obviously
a lot more flexible but the lack of
tactile feedback through the app is
exactly what you'd expect if you've ever
tried to play a racing game on your
phone and Wi-Fi limited range comes well
short of DJ is advertised to kilometer
maximum for the spark for that you need
the third control scheme the remote
which comes with some other benefits as
well some sticks which are by far the
best way to fly the spark are the most
obvious one but it's also got a
programmable button and some gimbal
controls and you get the option to
unlock sport mode which basically boosts
the maximum speed of the spark pi over
four times but if you're buying this
accessory I have to wonder a little bit
why you're buying a spark in the first
place it's a hundred and fifty dollars
standalone or $200 as part of the fly
more package that means we're not
talking about a $500 cellphone accessory
anymore it's not that we think the spar
is terrible it's just that if you're a
drone nerd then by the time you're
spending $700 4k video recording more
manual controls and better flight range
are just the beginning of the ways that
the Matic pro crushes this thing for
another 300 dollars and if the sales
pitches to Lindsay then the price to
fund ratio compared to cheap video
drones on Amazon is still kind of out of
whack and if you want to ask this kind
of premium then we think the
intuitiveness and the safety of the
gesture controls need some work
not including propeller guards in
particular is a pretty crap move on
something that's small and mainstream
enough that DJI must know that people
are going to be flying it indoors which
isn't to say that the spark doesn't have
a place in the market at all
it's still not water resistant that
could be improved but this thing is
astonishingly durable you probably
wouldn't even guess that the one in our
b-roll has been crashed three times and
the autonomous flight modes things that
you wouldn't find on a toy grade product
like beacon active track and even the
newer cinematic ones are as reliable as
they were on previous DJI offerings I
just think it's a little disingenuous to
call it a $500 drone when its
functionality is so limited in that form
and I wouldn't pay $700 for it
compared to the Matic Pro without some
more software improvements speaking of
improvements to the Matic you can
improve yours
with a skin from deer and deer and is
the place to go for skins that improve
the durability not to mention the sex
appeal of your devices be they phones
game consoles portable computers or
apparently drones
you can use their configurator to see
exactly what your device will look like
so whether you're looking to make it all
sleek in carbon-fiber II or whether you
want your device to look like pure
cancer you can check out the brand site
and for
just a few bucks skin up your device
