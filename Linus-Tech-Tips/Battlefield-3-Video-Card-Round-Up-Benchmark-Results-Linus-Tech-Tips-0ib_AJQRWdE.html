benchmarking this weekend right now I've
got these 6970 on the test bench so I'm
using my core i7 2670 running the CPU at
stock speed for this one the cards that
I'm benching are the 5 95 85 75 60 TI
550 6990 69 70 69 fifty and the 68 70 so
the settings I'm using are the high
preset in battlefield 3 just because I
wanted something that was going to be
not quite so high-end that I might run
into frame buffer issues I wanted to get
a good idea of how the game performs on
all of these GPUs relative to each other
so high settings and I'm running at
1080p so my benchmark sequence is on the
level I think it's called comrades
something like that whatever this level
is called and then as soon as I get out
of the car here I'm going to start and
he's gonna shoot the guy and then I'm
gonna get into the car so I'll start
I'll do my run-through and then I'm
going to record two minutes of fraps
gameplay then I play the same way every
time the repeatability of this
particular benchmark is can be done to
within about 0.5 of a frame per second
so that's what I would consider the
thank you that's what I would consider
to be the margin of error about 0.5 to 1
frame per second so I'm gonna follow him
I'm gonna have to apologize in advance
for my gameplay here my mouse
sensitivity is off and can't go away ok
hopefully that doesn't you know what
I'll probably have to redo this run off
camera but I just want to show you guys
the general run-through whenever my cats
don't interfere things go a little bit
more smoothly so wait for the car to go
and then I'm gonna go pillar to pillar
and try and see if there's any guys to
shoot and just keep moving up until I
gain this position here at which point I
will fight these guys well rather shoot
while they're not looking and then I
will fight the guys that come up the
stairs step back here a little bit kill
this guy Wow you can tell I'm playing on
be easy right like one shot to the guy's
hip and he goes down oh that's not
usually the way I go right over here
look over here
come back here kill this dude now the
autosave has kicked in this game was
really hard to find a good place to to
benchmark for two minutes straight
because what I really like to have is a
checkpoint so that I don't have to sit
through a cinematic sequence in between
GPUs every time but I wasn't able to
find a single two minute long
uninterrupted segment to play absolutely
ridiculous and I killed those guys too
quickly so I'm just gonna kind of stand
here and shoot a little bit because a
fraps counter shouldn't reappear until I
get to about right here there it goes
just like that so so yeah it was very
frustrating and I do have to sit through
that car sequence every time a lot of
the earlier levels especially are like
in the dark and like there's nothing
going on but I thought this was a pretty
good gameplay sequence so without
further ado I will present to you guys
my my graphs once I'm finished rewriting
this one and then I think I still have
the 60 he sent me to go so one thing
that I did forget to mention when I did
my initial video talking about the
benchmarking procedures that I am using
the latest driver so that is the
catalyst 11.1 or rather 11.10 drivers
from AMD and B GeForce to eighty five
point six two drivers from Nvidia so
these are the BLA you can read more
about it this is the recommend driver
from battlefield 3 and then I think on
the a ATI browser AMD release notes
battlefield 3 provides great crossfire
scaling and resolves issues when running
in crossfire mode now here comes the
results and rythmic so it's here there's
my graph so battlefield 3 FPS more is
better I'm gonna go ahead and give AMD
major props because yes their crossfire
scaling is outstanding the 6990 performs
on average at 114 point 8
FPS compared to the 69 70 and 60 4.2 now
my 6990 was running without the OC
switch enabled on it which means that
that is near-perfect
crossfire scaling simply outstanding
rarely rarely seen that in any kind of a
real-world scenario from Nvidia or from
AMD
so the 590 does scale but not as well as
the 69 90 and then here are the rest of
the cards so for these ones bear in mind
that these sort of equivalent g-force
and Radeon cards its equivalent in terms
of performance usually the Radeon cards
tend to be a little bit cheaper so I
think Andy's done a great job but I look
forward to seeing what Nvidia can do to
optimize their cards because generally
speaking the way I have it arranged is
the way i'm typically expecting to see
the performance line up and that is not
what i observed with battlefield 3 we're
seeing a serious equivalency between the
580 and the 69 70 the 570 and the 60
minute 50 and the 560 TI in the 68 70
i'd say anything above a 550 is suitable
for 1080p with all high presets but the
550 ti did slow down during firefights I
know I don't have minimum FPS on this
particular graph but this was the only
one where the minimum fps really
bothered me all the rest of them
provided a smooth gameplay experience
and thank you for checking out my
battlefield 3 performance video scene
