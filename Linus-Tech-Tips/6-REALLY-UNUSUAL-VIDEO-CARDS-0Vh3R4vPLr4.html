video cards these days are all such
conformists
plastic shrouds everywhere two two six
heat pipes your choice of blower or two
to three fans and that's it where has
the style gone to China apparently with
some help from our friends at Nvidia we
tracked down the five most mold breaking
graphics cards of the current generation
many of which aren't available in North
America at all for your viewing
perhaps gawking even pleasure
cooller masters 25th anniversary edition
cosmos 2 features a unique dual curved
tempered glass side panel check it out
now at the link below okay so some of
these cards are actually fairly well
known by now and palates calm xgt x 1050
TI is one of them it was first announced
back in February of this year and sports
no fan whatsoever just a rather sizable
heatsink and two lengthy heat pipes that
means that case clearance might be an
issue if you decide to pick one of these
up since from the cards edge to the end
of the heat pipe we measured 13 and 1/3
centimeters not a problem for wider
desktop cases like a define r5 but
definitely a consideration for a home
theater PC and we have another GTX 1050
ti2 this one's from MSI and it's got the
same specs but a pretty different
approach while it also sports a dual
slot design with roughly the same
overall length if you count the cooler
its width is much less and the card
itself is half height so as you might
expect it comes with a low-profile
bracket out of the box which means it's
a viable option for a cheap to you video
transcoding box or one of those slim pcs
that were so popular a couple of years
ago it's twin fan design means that
it'll generate some noise but we
shouldn't actually see any thermal
throttling and in our testing these two
were actually neck-and-neck the whole
time which really shouldn't come as that
much of a surprise given that they're
otherwise identical but what did blow us
away is that palettes call necks
actually ran slightly cooler than the
low profile actively cooled MSI and this
is in a closed case working our way up
the ladder this one should be very
exciting to small form-factor
enthusiasts we've got the gtx 1070
katana from Galax while not appreciably
longer than a founders edition gtx 1070
the katana
takes up only a single slot thanks to
its heavy use of copper and aluminum to
make the whole shroud part of the
cooling setup it's got a single blower
fan to exhaust case out these tiny holes
in the rear i/o and also just out into
your case and they even managed
impressively to include three outputs
meaning you're not losing out as far as
connectivity goes all this and without a
backplate but how does it measure up
performance wise well shockingly it's
actually right up there with our
founders Edition though the thermals
leave a lot to be desired and it
screamed like we were smashing its toes
with a hammer the whole time this card
is definitely not one that you'd want to
use in a case that doesn't have some
sound isolation or really at all unless
you really need a single slot card next
up in is a pair of freaking heavy GTX
1080s from in o3d and colorful and I do
mean pair because these cards are
strikingly similar with the no.3 di
chill and Hercules air boss behemoth
whatever it's called sporting not one
not two not three but four feds for
reasons I guess but hey maybe with the
hundred and fifty megahertz factory
overclock they're onto something and
finally the rgbi chill logo indicates
GPU load automatically which is kind of
cool even though we would prefer direct
control it's colorful twin here the eye
game ex top has a distinctive feature of
its own check this out it's got a turbo
button ah that brings me back to a
simpler time when pcs were beige and
Windows was up to version 95 anyway this
card comes with a surprisingly
well-written if somewhat rambling box
with no specs whatsoever we hit up the
website and wahoo the website is coming
to hit us a surprise that sounds
let's see what else we got here RGB
lighting on the logo and oh here we go
the turbo button actually boosts the
clock speed by about a hundred megahertz
meat
I'm not sure though why you wouldn't run
it that way all the time because that's
for performance it still actually fell a
little bit behind the in o3d I chill
which managed better numbers across the
board clearly that for sin is uh working
wonders finally our craziest card yet
the ten atti based colorful eye game wow
this thing weighs a lot
Vulcan X and holy balls is that a three
slot cart okay technically no because it
doesn't have more I over there but the
cooler does definitely cover up the slot
directly underneath so like the X top
the Vulcan X comes with a turbo button
that bumps the boost clock to two
gigahertz then aside from some gamer II
fans we've got six heat pipes connected
to two heat sinks which on its own would
be impressive but what is that on the
side next to the geforce logo that's a
screen baby a pretty crappy old-school
LCD screen but a screen nonetheless does
your graphics card show fan speed core
temperature core frequency and memory
usage conveniently on a little hard to
read display inside your tower instead
of in a sensible software interface no
well neither does ours because there's
no software in the box and not on the
english version of the website i've
still got to give them points for
originality though anyway how much does
a two gigahertz boost get you over a
regular 1080 TI well looks like
significant gains in synthetics and real
world numbers a couple frames higher
than our founders edition and to its
credit by the way it even went
overclocked stayed very very cool though
with the heatsink this big that
shouldn't exactly be a shock so there
you have it
six totally non mainstream graphics card
designs some are similar to ones that
were once popular like low profile
single slot or passive but with more
performance than we've ever seen in
these form factors before while others
take more let's say dramatic approaches
so would you buy any of these Hot Topic
versions of graphic cards or would you
rather just stick with comfortable
conformity let us know in the comments
below
