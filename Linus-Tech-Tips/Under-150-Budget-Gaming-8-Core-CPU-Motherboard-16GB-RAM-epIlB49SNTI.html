iPads for only $1 lab would be ask a man
only remedial internet users should be
clicking on that banner but what if I
told you instead that you can get an 8
core Intel processor 16 gigs of ram and
the motherboard combo for your next
gaming rig for under a hundred and fifty
US dollars that would be me spittin mad
truth CEO so stay tuned and I will show
you how
Corsairs RMI series power supplies
feature premium components for great
performance with very low noise check
out the link in the video description to
learn more so the first step here is CPU
shopping do a quick search for arc
that's a RK Zeon 5000 and scroll down
the results until you get to the CPUs
with frontside bus speeds rather than
qpi speeds listed that's the generation
where after they are old enough that due
to their lower performance and higher
power consumption compared to more
modern products they've lost a lot of
their value in the data center so fresh
crops have used parts are hitting eBay
pretty much constantly but they're good
enough that as you'll see in modern
desktop workloads they can perform
surprisingly well from here it's pretty
easy to compare specs for some context
the popular cue 6600 desktop chips that
I've used in scrapyard wars are 2.4
gigahertz quad cores without hyper
threading but bear in mind that I'm
usually banking on overclocking those to
3 gigahertz or so so since you probably
won't get any overclocking out of a
server motherboard try to find something
that can do about that
out of the box for comparable results
top-of-the-line chips due to their
rarity and ongoing value as a way of
squeezing a little more life out of an
old server are usually still too
expensive to be practical but once you
step down a couple tears you can find
some amazing deals here's a listing with
a bunch of three gigahertz quad cores
for only 20 bucks a pop note that when
you buy your CPUs you will need two of
the same model for your dual socket
motherboard so I ended up with a pair of
L 50 420 chips at 2.4 gigahertz next up
is the motherboard here things get a
little tricky because there's the usual
stuff like making sure you have the
appropriate connectors on your power
supply but given how many of the
second-hand boards out there are
salvaged units from pre-built servers
and stuff there are some other things to
watch out for as well
ours is a dell unit and here are some of
the things we ran into number one while
our board has a handful of mounting
holes that would line up with a standard
e8
case some modding would definitely be
required to mount it more securely and
this is about as good as you're likely
to find with some boards out there
unlikely to fit in any off-the-shelf
case number two there were some other
layout challenges including a capacitor
right behind the PCIe 16x slot that
required me to sawed off the lock on my
video card and a four pin CPU power
connector that almost prevented the
graphics card from being inserted number
three its expansion options are very
limited the top PCIe 16x physical slot
is only a PCIe gen one eight X lot
electrically and much worse than that it
only has one PCIe slot total on the
board
so if we wanted more than the near four
USB to ports for sound cards Wi-Fi USB 3
etc then we're pretty much out of luck
since we'll be using a graphics card in
the available slot and finally you'll
need to look out for other
eccentricities - very few boards will
include IO shields hooking up the front
panel switches and LEDs may take some
Sherlock Holmes level sleuthing or even
trial and error and don't be surprised
to encounter some other pretty random
stuff I mean ours was missing 4 pin
power connectors for the CPU fans since
in the original server it was designed
for the CPUs to be cooled passively with
the motherboard out of the way it's RAM
time and once again you need to be
somewhat careful here this generation of
Intel server motherboards could be
equipped with slots for normal ECC ddr2
or FB dim ddr2 and while they are both
available on the cheap it'll hurt the
bang for the buck of your system if you
order the wrong one and end up being
stuck with extra and it doesn't help
matters that many eBay listings don't
contain all the necessary information
here's a pro tip though you can identify
FB dims by the full heat spreader that
was used to cool the advanced memory
buffer chip these for contrast our
regular ECC ddr2 and that's what we
ended up using for our system but
there's another curveball here - server
RAM compatibility even if you've got the
right type can be a bit of a bear so
either select a rampart
number that was on the qvl or qualified
vendor list for that motherboard or get
the most generic thing you can and cross
your fingers something like this
kingston set is a fairly good bet
because it doesn't specifically call out
that is made for servers from a brand
like HP or Dell for CPU coolers we went
with some brand new stock coolers from
ebay then because I had forgotten that
this generation of Zeon's requires the
chassis itself to have threads for the
heatsink to bolt into I ended up using
some inserts from McMaster car and a
piece of particle board for a backplate
but if you're really trying to get your
system built on the cheap a ghetto
solution with zip ties might not be
pretty but should work just fine ha
which leads us finally to the big
question all of this is obviously a lot
more work than just going to NCIX and
ordering a new system so is it worth it
well in part 2 of this video next week
on vessel we'll find out just kidding
guys so to answer that I ran a handful
of games ranging from new ish to just
released a week ago in the case of Star
Wars Battlefront to see how she holds up
so I paired the system with a modern
enthusiast grade graphics card a gtx 980
and monitored GPU usage while gaming to
see if our graphics card was severely
bottlenecked by our cpu and while in
some games I did have to turn the in
game details down significantly to get
it running smoothly Crysis 3 run at
medium and shadow of Mordor performed
best at very high both with motion blur
off the results while still lower frame
rate wise than my usual test bench can
achieve even though it's running at
higher settings we're still what I would
describe as good enough and the better
optimized games even ran what I would
describe as very very well I mean
battlefront ran it 75 or so FPS at 1080p
at the highest details only 15 FPS less
than a 59 60 X and Tomb Raider ran
pretty much the same on both platforms
at ultimate settings I mean to put this
in perspective our whole base platform
cost less than
16-gig kit of premium ddr4 gaming memory
cool right yes but if buying old server
stuff was a magic bullet that killed all
your problems then everyone would do it
on top of the challenge of sourcing the
parts and assembling them there's no
warranty obviously there's really no
upgrade path to speak of while backwards
compatibility is a godsend like it's
great that your shiny new SSD works at
all you can forget about the latest
fastest data rates unless you want to
put expansion cards in and it's not like
Intel has been sitting on ass for nine
years
you can't expect your budget gaming box
to run with newer systems in every
workload I mean here's a Cinebench score
from this system but back to gaming
again this shopping strategy is even
more interesting than it appears to be
on the surface because our system
handles just barely the last of the
single and dual thread optimized
triple-a titles then just as this system
was about to get completely outdated
developer support arrived for multi-core
CPUs allowing it to stay relevant by
spreading the workload out across its
eight true processing cores and the
future actually looks even brighter
thanks to DirectX 12 and Vulcan
promising dramatic improvements to
multi-core scaling in games yet again so
the answer then - is it worth it finally
is that while I lied a little bit in the
beginning it's technically two quad-core
processors not an eight core processor
yes if you're willing to put a little
work into it and I'm sure you'd find
some help on the Linus tech tips forum
have that linked up there if you wanted
to do this this concept was a lot of fun
for me to explore and it is a worthwhile
strategy for a budget gaming box
