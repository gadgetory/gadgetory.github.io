Sykesville media router
and I don't think that's the whole name
of it so we're gonna coggle with their
proper name which is the nbg five seven
one five it is blazingly fast it has
concurrent dual band wireless n 450
megabit per second which to my
understanding is actually a first with
this particular router so you can
simultaneously stream HD movies play
online games and web surf okay that's
pretty much par for the course for a
wireless router I should certainly hope
you can do all of those things net USB
allows you to share printers and storage
wirelessly which is very cool alright
Gigabit net USB 2.4 and 5 gigahertz okay
you've got all of that going on let's
see what they've got to say for
themselves on the back so beamforming
supports X support extends effective
wireless coverage okay quality of
service enhances gaming and multimedia
streaming ok and v IPSec VPN tunnels
secure data transfer fascinating so
that's something that I haven't seen as
a called outs back on a consumer lever
around a level router ever so now you
are a wireless scheduling allows energy
savings so you can turn off your
wireless when you're you know at home
but sleeping for example or when you
don't want your kids surfing the net at
4:00 in the morning or whatever the case
may be let's go ahead pull this guy open
and have a look at what we've got inside
the box so the first thing is a
declaration of Conformity which I'm not
particularly interested in ok next we
have a utility users guide Quick Start
Guide Acrobat Reader and project product
registration CD next we have a warranty
card so let's see how long the warranty
is we take great pride in our quality
value and performance I believe this
product should offer you trouble-free
operation throughout its lifetime and it
doesn't actually say how long the
lifetime should be fascinating for
further information visit zexal comm
slash warranty so you can go ahead and
do that if you care that much hardware
installation so this is apparently a
QuickStart guide I guess it says
QuickStart guide at the top so they show
you how to put the antennas on how to
plug in the Wan LAN LAN LAN LAN LAN I
don't know DC in
plug in the power ok how to plug in USB
to either a printer or in some cases a
storage device if you want to go ahead
and have a network store device job
which is just a USB not powered but it
has a USB interface to your router and
then you can use that as a network share
okay we double ups set out how to do
that all right
wow this thing is huge this is one of
the bigger routers that I've seen in
quite a while so let's go ahead and I'll
take the router out but we're not gonna
look closely at that just yet so let's
pull out first by the way we have a
trial cameraman here today so you know
feel free to leave your comments on the
on the YouTube comments let me know what
you think you know good terrible a be
adequate all right we've got three
included antennas so I'm gonna go ahead
and actually I'm not gonna put those on
yet because I'm gonna take the plastic
layer off first this has kind of a neat
neat look to it I mean I've I've never
really believed that the router should
be like a fashion statement but if it
has to not if it you know has to not
look stupid or you have to see it then
it might as well you know look kind of
look kind of different so there you go
it has kind of a wavy finish to it the
insights are kind of matte and then the
top is sort of velocity actually this is
glossy - let's see how
fingerprint-resistant it is actually
that's not bad so it's got a bit of sort
of smear edge going on but the good news
or bad news I don't know I'm about to
find out is that it comes off really
easily and doesn't scratch too easily
because a lot of the time these glossy
finishes especially on routers I had one
router that had a black glossy finish on
it and literally you went like this it
was like the whole thing was just
scratched up just from your fingers okay
so we've got that must be WPS wow
there's a bunch of different stuff okay
so you can turn the lights on and off
you can turn the wireless on and off so
that the nice dedicated button to have
there okay we've got our USB ports so
two of those I'm gonna you know what
give me a sec here guys because I'm
gonna need a minute to find out what all
these buttons do I don't think I've seen
this many buttons on a consumer
effort okay we figured it out here's WPS
this is Wireless on this is light on or
light off on the other side these
probably are prompting it to look for
something on the USB port okay we've got
a power switch at the back DC power in
we have four Gigabit LAN ports and then
we have our land port we've also got a
reset switch so there's your hard reset
and I'm just going to go ahead and throw
these on in terms of the other included
accessories there's not a whole lot
there's just a power adapter which is
just your standard wall work as well as
a yellow Ethernet cable very stylin of
course so gold plated connectors - all
right so we'll go ahead for this one
here I actually don't mind the overall
layout of this it's very unconventional
so it kind of sits like this on the desk
and it doesn't appear that there is a
way to remove the bottom stand so yeah
so it sits on the desk like that and
then all of the cables plug in from the
back so thank you for checking out this
