our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner hey guys as you saw in
the livestream Samsung had a big
announcement about a differently
designed TV at a different landscape
basically as you can see this is it
unfortunately it's not a consumer model
this is more for people with
advertisements in their stores and
whatnot so we're not gonna cover this
too much because it's not exactly what
it we thought it was so moving on so I
was talking about these ones earlier
they've got the DJ swivel that we were
talking about they've got a detachable
cable it's got a lock on it we'll show
you that right now if we can just get
around here real quick so these ones
were the ones I was checking out as you
can see here having some trouble with
the tablet but as you can see here the
cable actually has notches on it so you
can plug it in there and then turn it
and it locks right in so I won't just
randomly come out on you also both sides
swivels it's a little bit tense which is
actually a good thing you don't want it
to just randomly swivel on you so each
side swivels which is great and they
sound quite good is there anything else
you wanted to say well yeah it looks in
at 90 to 180 degrees which is kind of
cool and those feet of the Oh around
ears feature to a 50 millimeter driver
the on ears feature 40 millimeter driver
thanks a lot for showing us or anybody
thanks for checking us out
tune into lines tech tips for all of our
CES coverage hey guys guess what I'm
diesel and we were just walking by we
saw those case and I thought you know
what I really like look we walked into
here I saw this like my childhood
favorite Hello Kitty would like crow
feel like that was my sort of thing and
I just had to come in here give it a hug
and I think my life is complete now hey
guys how you doing this is Harrison law
you don't know me a lot of you might
from a couple of videos but I'm here
check MLT to action booth checking out
this really cool multi-touch display
they have here so I infrared sentence
underneath this specific one is uh was
this kind of designed with a little bit
by DJ so every one of these different
blocks has a different IR code on it
when you put them on different sound
comes up when you spin them volume goes
down spinning markup volume goes up you
can intertwine them with one another you
can add different effects really really
cool technology that's going on here I
love it being a former DJ myself this
would be incredible having the club mess
around with different sounds mess around
them volumes again fantastic has the
most multitude of other uses for this as
well when being college dorms or whatnot
again fully fully uh touch surfaces
