intel core i7 4770k unlocked processor
if you're a speed freak added until 3500
series SSD to your Haswell system for a
truly enthusiast class experience
welcome to my unboxing an overview of
the ct1 5t - b1 this is from Vizio or as
I call it the mobile juggernaut what I
like about this particular notebook
already I've had it out of the box I've
been using this we filmed a video about
it so there's there's already been some
stuff going on but what I like about it
is the fact that it is still reasonably
thin and light while delivering a quad
core Core i7 processor so this is a
third gen quad core and staying super
super thin so it's not an ultrabook by
any stretch of the imagination because
that is a special intel speck but it's a
thinner light much more powerful than an
ultrabook notebook so right here we get
a quick start guide ok cleaning a lot I
didn't even know that was here there's
no cleaning guac as well you also get a
power grip which is a reasonable-sized
power brick this particular notebook
uses onboard HD 4000 graphics so you
don't need any kind of like massive
brick here it is next to an HTC one for
size comparison that size comparison
thing I like to do it also has a cool
little color indicator power plug that
goes into the side of the notebook so
this lights up different colors
depending on the status green for fully
charged for example and last but not
least an AC power cord that goes into
the back of the adapter that is all this
is included so let's get physical with
this bad boy the first thing you notice
taking it out of the box is it is
extremely slimming it is extremely
aluminum the aluminum unibody chassis
gives it a ton of rigidity and like
advise feel to it that you just don't
get from a plastic notebook I'm gonna
whip out my HTC one here so you guys can
see a quick size comparison so it's
about double the thickness of a modern
smart phone and it really draws some
more comparisons with the HTC One as
well because it's all about build
quality HTC One versus Galaxy s4 the big
thing everyone's talking about is
aluminum versus plastic plastic is going
to be lighter weight although this thing
isn't super heavy it's four point eight
four pounds but with the aluminum
give it as it gives it like a feel to it
that you just don't get with aluminum
the bottom itself is a soft touch
plastic because you can't have an entire
sealed aluminum case you have to put
components in it somehow and other than
that the bottom is extremely clean with
just four non-slip pads as well as a
small reset button and a little bit of
information about vizio down there on
the side of the notebook we find power
in USB 3 and a headphone microphone
combo jack on the front of the notebook
we find a whole lot of not much of
anything other than a power indicator
LED right there which you can see is
indicating it's in sleep right now and
then on the right hand side we find HDMI
out as well as another USB 3 port on the
back we find just a solid clean aluminum
backing and then it is time to open this
bad boy up
inside we find a large multi-touch
trackpad right there you can also see
that instant on more on that in a moment
as well as a wide format keyboard so it
uses slightly wider keys than I'm
accustomed to I personally because I
have small hands would have preferred a
smaller keyboard and a number pad but
not everyone feels the same way as me
about all of that and of course you've
got their srs stereo speaker right up
here at the top ventilation is craftily
hidden by that clean backing we saw
before and hopefully i can get you guys
an end let that but there's a copper
heatsink kind of hopefully i can show
you this copper heat sink in there and
ventilation holes all in the back so it
gives it a very very clean external
appearance you can't even see the
cooling and of course the PSLRA system
so this particular notebook is the 15.6
inch 10 inch 10 inch 10-point
multi-touch IPS screen so that means you
get the viewing angle benefits of IPS as
well as the color richness benefits of
IPS color vibrancy benefits of IPS and
pretty much I just love IPS and I can't
get enough of it and if you guys watch
my videos a fair bit you'll probably
already know that we're all spec wise
you find a lot of the stuff that you
normally would so it's got eight gigs
around a 256 gig SSD so that's solid
state storage as well as an Intel Core
i7 36:35 QM so that goes all the way
from 2.4 gig
Hertz all the way up to 3.4 gigahertz in
turtle which makes it a boat when doing
something intensive like video editing
about 50% faster than my existing
notebook which has an i7 what's it
called 740 QM so that's a previous
generation it's slower clocked so this
is pretty much better in every possible
way it comes with Windows 8 which of
course is great for the touchscreen
experience I personally find Windows 8
makes sense on tablets make sense on
notebooks but isn't that great for me on
the desktop experience yet because I
find it's a little bit far away from me
but on a notebook I even find myself on
non-touchscreen notebooks from time to
time touching the screen now because I'm
starting to get used to it I feels like
ok so I using a spy are 7 normally as my
daily driver and it bothers me that it
doesn't have an Ethernet port this one
bothers me a lot less because it does
have wireless 802.11 AC which in my
personal experience is way faster than
Wireless n because it relies on the 5
gigahertz band as well as some other
cool technologies that make it just well
faster than ten hundred Ethernet which
is a huge bonus and in spite of previous
wireless technology claims that wasn't
happening it has a 90 watt hour battery
which doesn't look user replaceable but
you know there's some screws down here
so who knows maybe you could fill
something if you really needed to and I
think that's pretty much it so basically
what does it come down to with this one
it's easy to open it has a very good
aesthetic it's an eye Turner already
I've had quite a few people ask me about
it whether they've seen it behind the
scenes and videos or whether they've
seen me actually carrying the thing
around it has an IPS display which is a
huge deal every notebook should have
solid build quality and an IPS display
the speakers are loud enough no
particular base to speak of but they
were definitely usable it passes my Flex
test so it has excellent rigidity to the
chassis because of that aluminum unibody
particularly when you go and put the
screen on it like that I mean I always
heave on stuff so you guys will see flex
I see people say that all the time in
the comments although I said it didn't
flex but it did yeah by comparison it
didn't flex everything will flex if you
heave on it hard enough and no junk wear
so they have us-based tech support and
find anything on this notebook that I
particularly needed to uninstall so that
was actually quite refreshing if there
was something that I'd want to add to it
I would definitely download a Start menu
for Windows 8 if you're not familiar
with Windows 8 or even if you are
familiar with Windows 8
grab a start menu for Windows 8 a
backlit keyboard would be nice and a
revision 2 and an SD card reader would
have been nice but overall it looks like
a very very solid value over at Vizio
comm so thank you for checking out this
unboxing and first look at the oh I
don't even stand a chance of remembering
that model number anymore the CT 15 tb1
is it a replacement for an ultrabook I
use an ultrabook no but is it a perfect
substitute for someone who can't make do
with the dual core maximum that you find
in an ultrabook these days but still
need something that's reasonably thin
and light and portable I say yes don't
forget to subscribe - tech tips from our
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos and like the video leave a
comment under the video and let me know
what do you think would you rather have
a quad-core slim workstation style PC or
would you rather have a super thin and
light ultra book and compromise on the
overall mmm of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
