that's how I interpreted all the likes
on that video I did recently where I
asked you to hit the like button if you
wanted to see these puppies so here it
is one of only a handful in existence
Corsairs dominator Platinum 128 gigabyte
ddr4 2400 megahertz
Ram kit and let's try that whole thing
again drop a like on this one if you
want us to make a video showing you
what's in this ultra wide heroes box
that I just got in the mail from LG
the coarser HX 1200 i power supply
delivers a B+ platinum efficiency for
quiet performance and coarser link
digital advanced monitoring and control
click now to learn more we don't do
videos about memory kits very often
these days so when we do we like to make
them count so instead of just doing a
bunch of sexy unboxing footage where I
tell you guys about how your memory kit
with its customizable and color
changeable light bars and sexy heat
spreader design should you wish to spend
this much on it will come in a custom
box that was specially made for 8 dim
sets and includes two matched trays of
quad-channel ddr4 memory running at 2400
mega Hertz with Dominator airflow
coolers to go on each side of your
motherboard for maximum cooling and sex
appeal instead of doing that I'll find
something interesting to investigate and
bring you guys along for the ride so not
that long ago we determined that even
for a high-performance quad-core
processor
ddr3 vs. ddr4 didn't impact performance
much in desktop applications but I want
to take it further this time and find
out if we need quad-channel ddr4 ram if
we kick things up a notch and throw in
18 core 36 thread processor at the same
multi-threaded benchmarks so I fired
this baby up on my usual a soos x99
deluxe test bench I was only able to get
the RAM running at 21 33 megahertz by
the way but I know that my xenon has
trouble with high-speed memory and when
I tried it on a 59 60 X it worked fine
and that shouldn't affect our test
results much anyway and then I ran my
suite of benchmarks with a hundred and
twenty eight gigabytes of RAM in the
system then I was all geared up to
slowly ramp it down and run it in triple
channel and then dual channel and then
single Channel when I realized I'm
really not expecting this to make any
difference anyway so let's just drop her
straight down to 16 gigs of memory which
amazingly is one single stick of this
ram and then see how the benchmarks go
and as expected going from single all
the way to quad channel makes
much no difference in anything but our
seven zip compression benchmark and
synthetic memory bandwidth tests and in
those cases we were nowhere near filling
up all 128 gigabytes of our memory
either which leads us to the conclusion
already who and what is this Ram for
well it's for people who want the
ultimate bragging rights to make their
EP bigger regardless of the cost and I
guess there is something brag worthy
about having literally the same amount
of RAM as your buddy has storage space
on his boot SSD even if it will be years
before desktop workloads benefit from
this kind of a config and anyone running
that many virtual machines or any of the
simulation or rendering workloads that
can benefit from this much memory should
probably be using ECC registered DIMMs
in a server or workstation anyway it's
just that this is a lot sexier speaking
