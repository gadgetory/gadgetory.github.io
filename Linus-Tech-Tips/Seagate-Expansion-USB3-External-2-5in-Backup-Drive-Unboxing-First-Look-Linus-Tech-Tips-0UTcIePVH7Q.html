new and improved series of external two
and a half inch storage drive so I
showed you guys the backup plus and the
backup plus for Mac well this is the
expansion portable drive and what makes
an expansion is that it is a Don storage
for your pc so as you may or may not
have figured out so far this is the non
backup plus version so it doesn't have
the facebook backup that the backup plus
one has as well as potentially more
social media backup features in the
future like YouTube and whatever else
this one is just your basic expansion
more storage and that's about it the
instructions are fairly straightforward
get the things and plug them in ok
limited warranty eight has a one year
warranty and those are the terms and
they have actually updated their shelf
so they're using a different type of
enclosure just a plastic enclosure it's
called like kind of a angular sort of
look to it pretty bog standard as far as
USB three two and a half inch enclosures
go this is a 500 gig version alone as if
available in a variety of capacities it
comes with a USB three cable now unlike
some of their existing or like op unlike
some of their previous products there's
no modular interface on this one this is
a USB 3 drive comes with a USB 3 to say
to chipset inside it there's no there's
no like conversion kit like we've seen
on their gold flecks products for
example I don't think I actually have
one lying around in here unfortunately
but if you guys have seen almost any of
my videos where I do benchmarks you'll
know what I'm talking about because I
use it for my Steam drive and that way I
can use whatever interface i want this
is just USB 3 this is just basic and it
just looks a little bit something like
that so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at sea games
