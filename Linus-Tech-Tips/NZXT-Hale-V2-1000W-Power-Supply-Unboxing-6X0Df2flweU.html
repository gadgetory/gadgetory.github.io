at the NZXT heil v2 series now as per
the v2 this isn't NZXT is first kick at
the can when it comes to a power supply
but they are continuing with their
original philosophy which was leading a
customer support for their PS use now
it's hard to differentiate a power
supply these days it's got a fan it's
got a 24-pin connector it's got like
power end and it's probably got some
kind of an 80 plus rating in this case
it's 80 plus gold which is i think where
that 90 comes from because it's
basically ninety percent efficiency but
check this out this is the less than
three which is their little heart rate
here so it's two steps if there's a
problem within the five-year warranty
period for your power supply they will
not only pay to ship it back to you
which is what most companies do but they
will also pay for you to simply schedule
a pick up and ship it back to them on
their dime so the idea is that an RMA
shouldn't cost the customer anything
even though that is not the industry
standard and applies to US and Canada
residents only apparently but there you
go that's what they're going for here so
it's fully modular Japanese capacitors a
single 12 volt rail 135 millimetre dual
ball bearing fan and energy-saving which
of course any 80 plus gold power supply
would tend to be NZXT does a great job
with their packaging so they've got a
nice soft foam here that gives you a
nice little look at the power supply
through that window in the top and then
they've got a very stylish white bag
that includes all of the cables that you
need so it's fully modular like I said
before which means you've got a
detachable 24-pin connector actually you
know what let's get into the let's get
into the cables a little bit more after
so you've got power assurance look at
that they include a little QC thing so
they do a 45 degree burn in they do
initial test they check the soldering
secondary neat neat I mean obviously you
know QC gets done at some point for most
products but the fact that they include
that for you I think it's just kind of
neat users manual so it's available in
850 watts a thousand watts and 1200
watts and that leaves us pretty much
with the power cable and then the power
supply itself look at that they're using
the higher current connector for the
back of the power supply in spite of the
fact that it's just a thousand watt unit
it's not necessary but including a beefy
power cable is not really a bad thing by
any stretch of the imagination
they include five cable ties as well as
four black screws so that you can
install the power supply and manage your
cables and of course the obligatory bag
of throwaway do not eat silica gel that
leaves us with pretty much the power
supply itself so I'm gonna go ahead and
put the Box down there I personally love
white power supplies I think they look
really stylish I think they look really
good and I think as long as they have
awesome innards then then that's all
very good things so here on the top
you've got that hundred and thirty-five
millimeter dual ball bearing fan that we
talked about before as well as a
classy-looking NZXT logo I'm gonna try
and get this sticker off really quick
here see if I can make that happen there
we go
love it it's a simple stamped metal logo
just kind of a black glossy finish over
it looks really nice on this side you've
got a heil 90 this is kind of a
rubberized finish so this isn't metal so
the metal is actually just the white
part here which feels like a very
durable paint finish it's got some
texture to it so I'm not gonna worry
about accidentally scratching it that
was my one complaint about the old ocz
power stream 520 awesome power supply
single strong 12 volt rail back in the
days when that wasn't that common but
the finish on that thing was terrible
you installed it in the system and then
it just looked like but on the other
side so you can see that they've got it
such that you can install it either way
and the text on the side will be correct
see there you go you've got another
rubber strip that looks equally good and
then there's your modular interface so
we're gonna go ahead and pull out all of
the cables and we'll be back in a moment
so in terms of modular connectors
there's actually a very wide variety so
check this out
these are all PCI Express here so six
six plus two connectors and this is
actually quite nice to see so even
though a lot of power supplies that have
flat cables for the molex and SATA
connectors you'll see you'll see a
sleeved connector four PCIe
but instead NZXT has opted for flat
ribbon cables even for PCI Express the
it's also quite optimal so you're gonna
be able to manage the cables behind your
motherboard tray bring them out behind
your video card and I mean it's so nice
because most most video cards these days
on the high performance side have at
least two PCIe connectors on them so
what's great about having these flat
cables is that you can easily run them
somewhere together see that without them
actually taking up much additional bulk
at all so then when they reach the
destination
it doesn't look untidy and gross it just
looks very very clean so from an
aesthetic standpoint I think these are
this is one of the nicest
implementations I've ever seen of that
so kudos to NZXT for that you've also
got a standard 4+4 and another standard
4+4 and dedicated connectors for these a
lot of the time you see on modular power
supplies they're going to give you the
option to either install to eight pin
CPU connectors or your full complement
of PCI Express connectors but they have
not done that you can plug in all of
them as much as you want all the time
the 24 pin connector is the only one
that uses a braided sleeving on top of
it as opposed to a flat connector I'd
love to see someone implement a flat 24
pin and then if I had to complain about
the power supply which I guess I sort of
I'm supposed to I'd say not enough SATA
so we've got three quad SATA harnesses
which is up to 12 connectors but I'd
like to see more of a mixture so maybe a
couple quad ones and a couple dual ones
because you're not always going to be
running them somewhere where you
actually have to connect four devices
and we really don't need this much molex
anymore so we've got a triple molex with
a floppy we've got not triple molex with
a floppy we've got a triple Boulard
quadruple molex and then we've got
another quadruple molex I'd say SATA is
a much more common connector now than
molex these days so I wouldn't have
minded seeing that changed around anyway
if you're wondering about the weird
setting it's rock-solid see get it run a
