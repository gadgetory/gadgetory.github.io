rather zone our product to unbox this is
the mobile headphone amp USB soundcard
so azusa's claim is that this can power
up to 150 ohm headphones which should
basically cover anything out there as
far as gaming headsets go so this is a
gaming oriented product and they are
saying that it can pretty much power any
gaming headphones and it is a great
replacement for onboard notebook audio
so there is the USB device itself you
know what let's go ahead and get it open
up here and then we will talk about it
in a little bit more detail actually you
know what not let's do the back first
okay audio chipset is proprietary Asus
one it uses USB 2 okay public features
hasn't LED indicator play music and idle
LED on mute is LED off ok cool operating
systems Windows 7 in Vista and XP Dolby
technologies including Dolby headphone
bill via virtual speaker Dolby Pro Logic
s' and Dolby Digital live so dolby
headphone means that you can use this
sound card in order to power your
regular stereo headphones in Virtual
Surround
ok so that's a sort of a preference
thing whether you like it or not but
you'll have the option analog output
jack and digital spit if output combo so
it has a three and a half millimeter
mini analog and digital combo jack cool
built-in headphone amp with up to 98
decibel sound to noise ratio signal to
noise ratio sorry I always say sound to
noise ratio but I know it's not right
okay for 32 ohms cool okay so you
actually have three different games that
you can select in the software so you
can tweak it depending on what kind of
impedance the headphones you and using
happen to be analog input jack is a mic
in okay so you can use this for your
microphone as well as for your
headphones okay driver features you can
just sort of look at that you guys can
pause if you really want to read that
okay actually know some of these are
important so the 3d yep normalizes the
volume of smart volume
okay magic voice that's kind of neat
modifies the sound of your voice for
VoIP and online chat applications hello
hi - okay that's not very good but
whatever GX two-point-five enables the
latest EAX audio so that's e^x 5.0 and
audio performance so there's your audio
performance specs right there what else
we got here system requirements really
256 Meg's of RAM oh so I can't run this
on like my my Pentium 1 ok package
contents ok what else we got here
not English headphone amplifier so extra
bass punches and sound details by fine
tune headphone amp circuit ok what
they're trying to say is that using a
headphone amp even a small USB powered
one like this and using a sound card
even a USB one like this is going to be
world's better than whatever you're
using on your notebook now the exception
might be notebooks that actually have
high-end onboard sound although those
are few and far between I have been an
advocate for a very long time of using
sound solutions that aren't total
totally horrible so the zone are you
three aims to achieve that on the
notebook side I would not necessarily
recommend using this on a desktop
because that is not the intended purpose
but for a notebook you can't expect to
have a significantly better experience
so you can output to a variety of
different things including look at this
you can output spit if out to an
amplifier or rather a receiver you can
connect headphones and microphone you
can connect a line in audio source and
you can configure what all of these are
doing through the driver we also have
included a USB extension cable so this
is going to allow you to not plug it
directly into your notebook say you have
a notebook that doesn't have enough
space around the USB port so you got
other things plugged in you can't fit
sort of a bulky connector like this well
you can use the extension cable to just
run it a little ways away so let's have
a look at the u3 itself it's fairly
straightforward I think there we go it's
got two things on the top that look like
speakers but they're not ok it's got a
cap which stays connected which is
kind of handy because you don't want to
lose it okay it's got a split ring
keychain attached your thing here so in
theory that will also help you to not
lose it there are is your headphone jack
as well as your microphone jack hold on
this moment so what makes this better
than your onboard audio in all
likelihood your onboard audio is using
an inferior audio chipset because that's
one of the specs that Joe average
consumer doesn't care about when you're
shopping for a notebook so they tend to
cheap out on it the other reason is that
it is separated from the rest of the
components that are inside your notebook
so there's all kinds of fan spinning and
electrons moving around and high
frequency switching going on that causes
all kinds of absolute havoc on audio
equipment which is designed to operate
that's one design dog very best but is
limited to operating best when there are
very few sources of interference so I
would say you're going to get the best
performance out of it when you actually
take it and plug it into this and get it
as far away from your netbook as
possible one of the other reasons is
they use what they're calling X
grounding in order to reduce even
further the interference that can be
caused by the PCB design itself so
that's good as well one last thing I
wanted to also mention actually this is
on my deck here you know so there's
three different modes there's VoIP mode
there's gaming mode and there's
excitement list you know zero boost to
the noise audio level then there's a
nine decibel boost which also includes
amplifying some of those higher range
sounds you know that the footsteps for
you FPS gamers and then finally the
excite mode I think is more for viewing
video so it's a little bit loud or so
and is great for you know explosions and
all that kind of good stuff so thank you
