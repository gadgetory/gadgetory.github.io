back up our entire petabyte server to
Google drive's cheap unlimited tear was
going to hit a snag
at some point and from talking to
Wendell over at level one text that
point seems to be at about a hundred and
fifty terabytes of storage when they
start throttling you later so fine then
it's okay because we had a back-up plan
anyway why store your data in the cloud
when you can store it on tapes
Mack Weldon makes great underwear

tech tips you'll get 20% off through the
link below I'm wearing Mac loading
underwear right now to show it to you
I'd have to give myself a pre epic
wedgie though like a front wedgie
this is the Meg store TRB 3 - HL 8 a
Thunderbolt 3 equipped tape reader that
even in 2018 costs about 10 times more
than your mom or dad's wife I did back
in the 1980s yes my friends this puppy
will run you about six thousand dollars
for the single deck version or nine
thousand for a dually so how on earth
does that make any sense let's start
this story by backing up a little bit so
when I was growing up the way to archive
data long term was using optical media
so the CD was high on its victory over
the cassette in the music industry I
think I have a CD around here somewhere
Oh anyway
CDs were slow and inconvenient to create
assuming that you could afford a CD
burner at all but their massive capacity
meant that compared to floppy disks oh I
have those too compared to floppy disks
and even zip disks you could store what
felt like an unlimited amount of at
least certain types of files because
remember that a 1.44 megabyte floppy
- formatting overhead could only store
like a handful of even basic things like
homework assignments over time though
portable hard drives which have come
down and cost dramatically over the last
decade or two and cloud storage which is
undeniably more convenient for small
backup jobs have gradually displaced
optical media in
the booster shots that optical discs
have gotten along the way like
rewritable capabilities the capacity
upgrades that DVD and blu-ray brought
there's just there's just a practical
limit to how small you can make the
little bumps on these plastic and foil
frisbees before the cost to make them
just stops making sense but that doesn't
mean that the expensive drive cheap
media model is dead at all in fact all
this time quietly in the background tape
storage has been alive and well in the
enterprise space with even modern super
computers like the SFU cedar
installation that we toured last year
being equipped with state-of-the-art
tape libraries this product is a little
different though so it's the same actual
drive that you would find in a data
center they're actually all made by IBM
these days and then rebadged so it's LTO
8 which means that each of your tapes is
gonna have a total of 12 terabytes of
storage now there is this 30 terabytes
on here but that assumes that whatever
data you're putting on it is highly
compressible so that would not apply to
the kind of media that we would be
backing up in fact for most things very
few people use it so 12 terabytes is
really what you can count on and then it
also means LTO 8 that we are compatible
with either these LTO 8 tapes or LTO 7
normally you would get two generations
of backwards compatibility but there was
a materials change to barium ferrite
that made that impractical this time
around alright so why did they put all
this work into creating a Thunderbolt 3
enclosure for a tape drive well for
people like me who have hundreds of
terabytes of data but who don't
necessarily need lightning fast access
to it so what we're gonna do is give it
a try now when I first set this up I
actually did it on a Windows machine but
quite frankly I wouldn't really
recommend that it's not a fantastic
experience
there's
this whole annoying rigmarole to get the
drivers installed you have to disable
driver signature enforcement you got to
make some changes in the BIOS it's it's
a real hassle but once you do get it
working assuming that you can find an
app that cooperates there are some
driver issues on Windows as well it is a
lot more painless than it used to be now
in the old days with tape drives you
used to have to take all the files that
you wanted to archive wrap them up into
another type of file called a dot tar
file or a tar ball and then if you
wanted to pull anything off of it you
had to pull the whole thing off and then
you could pick out the one file that you
needed now it's basically drag and drop
so whether you're using finder or
Windows Explorer it's a much more
seamless experience let's go ahead and
load this puppy in
doesn't that sound delightfully retro so
takes like 30 seconds or so to
initialize but we're just gonna enjoy
those sounds together
so the thing about tape is that it has
to be read from and written to linearly
there's no read/write head that can jump
around on the media and obviously unlike
solid-state storage it can't just grab
an address and pull the data directly so
you're gonna hear a lot of it reeling
and unreeling tape whenever you use the
thing so this is a piece of software
called my LTO they have a more advanced
version called pre-roll post that has a
bunch of database features but basically
what this is you don't strictly speaking
needed but what it is is it's a piece of
software for helping you keep all of
your backups organized so in the event
that you want to go back and pull like
an old news story or something to refer
back to it you know exactly where to go
which labeled tape to pull and where
exactly in the folder structure you
would find the files that you're looking
for it's going to take a couple minutes
here to figure out exactly how much data
is in this folder on our nas on the
vault so this is pulling off a petabyte
project so that took about 20 minutes
but the bottleneck here is just our
network connection to the vault so now
we can go ahead and begin
so as you get two breaks and files
you're gonna hear it kind of rev down
but in general we're able to do anywhere
from about a hundred and fifty to two
hundred and small change megabytes per
second and that's over the network you
can actually do as much as three hundred
megabytes per second under ideal
conditions so if you like me we're
thinking initially when you saw this
well Thunderbolt 340 gigabit per second
like is that kind of an overkill
interface for this the answer is
actually not as much as you might think
so we're still about fifteen hours left
in order to copy about four terabytes of
data and I believe it typically quotes
this in terms of coffee time there's
also a verification process that it has
to go through that takes almost as long
as the initial copy so to be clear it's
not like you're gonna be editing video
off something like this or anything like
that like if you have to grab one file
that's on one end of the tape and then
one file that's on the other one the
whole thing has to spool through like
it's crazy slow but while there is still
a purpose to having quick access to a
lot of our footage so it's not like the
vault is going anywhere so over
thunderbolt with a ten gigabit network
connection we can easily back up an
entire tape over the course of a day and
the costs compared to hard drives in
store inators start to make a lot of
sense once you get over about the 100 to
200 terabyte range add to that that
these things are rated at a 30 year
shelf-life
compare that to hard drives whose
lubrication will kind of wear out and it
seep away causing them to die over time
and tape might just be the way forward
