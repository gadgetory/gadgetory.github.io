trip here to their booth at CES 2018
where we are checking out the mate 10
Pro Wow they've got long tethers on
these things look at that you can like
basically walk off with it I was
expecting it to get caught but I mean
yeah I really was not intending to hold
up that one because I've actually
already got my own that I've been
playing around with for the last about
48 hours in a nutshell their claim to
fame with this one is this is their
first phone with an AI processor or an
NP u so it's got a Chiron 970 this is an
8 core chip built on the 10 nanometer
process it's got 6 gigs I've ran 128
gigs of storage
it's got ip67 water and dust resistance
an 18 by 9 OLED screen at 2160 by 1080
resolution a 4000 milliamp hour battery
and it's a 6-inch display phone which is
actually really impressive given the
form factor it does have a little bit of
heft to it but that is a lot of hardware
in really not a lot of space it does not
have microSD expansion but it does
support dual Sims so you can travel with
it very easily and one of the big things
they're talking about here is the camera
it's got a dual sensor rear camera with
glass from Leica a 20 megapixel sensor
under one of them
that's a monochrome sensor and a 12
megapixel color sensor under the other
they've got optical image stabilization
and back to that AI processor a lot of
the features of the camera are actually
powered by it so one of the coolest
things that it can do is subject
recognition and scene recognition and
it's really fast so it recognizes all
kinds of things from flowers to skies to
night scapes to Sun rises to plants to
food to text that text 1 is more
important than you might think I don't
know about you guys but I scan stuff
with my phone all the time and it can do
more things with AI as well from
Huawei's research they found that the
biggest things that people complain
about with their phones are performance
and
battery so the plan is to use AI to
dynamically optimize the performance and
battery life of the phone for each
individual user and they are claiming
that after 500 days of using it you
won't experience a slowdown so this baby
comes pre-loaded with Android 8 Oreo and
it is going to be priced at $7.99 for
this version or there's actually a
porsche design more premium version
that's going to be 1225 though they did
mention in the keynote that if you move
fast
some participating retailers will have a
hundred and fifty dollar gift card
incentives so thanks for checking out
this video thanks to huawei for
sponsoring our trip down here to their
booth you guys can like this video if
you liked it you can just like it if you
didn't like it quite so much and you can
