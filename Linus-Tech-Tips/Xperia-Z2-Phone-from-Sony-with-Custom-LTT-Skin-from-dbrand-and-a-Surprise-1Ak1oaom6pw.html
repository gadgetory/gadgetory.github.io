concept and an otherwise truly excellent
phone let down by a really crummy TN
panel screen let's find out if its
successor the z2 improves enough of the
right things to win my coveted the
screen doesn't suck and it's otherwise
pretty good to award the flash voyager
gtx USB 3 drive from corsair provides
SSD like performance and fits
comfortably in your pocket click now to
learn more things started off on a high
note when I pulled this custom Xperia z2
more on this later and possibly an
exciting surprise out of its custom box
and discovered that Sony has a wireless
data transfer wizard now in addition to
their older PC based one thumbs up
during setup process you're prompted to
create an optional Sony account which
handles helping you track down your
phone or wipe it if you lose it and then
you are dumped on to the home screen
where we get our first look at the z2 s
preloaded apps most of these
unfortunately are here to help you buy
content from Sony but things do get a
little bit better the second page ships
with useful widgets for the camera
gallery and Walkman music playback app
and well there's no shortcut here Sony
also includes a rudimentary backup and
restore app something I feel like stock
Android is really missing onto the
product tour and ergonomics basic specs
wise we've got a Snapdragon 801
processor 2.3 gigahertz with three gigs
of RAM 16 gigs of on-board storage a
3200 milliamp-hour battery wireless AC
and LTE and an aluminum / glass ID that
I find absolutely beautiful so on the
surface compared to the z1 it's
basically now with 30% more gen but
looking past that starting at the front
of the phone we find one significant
improvement almost immediately that
screen has gotten more than a point two
inch upgrade it's an IPS panel now
instead of a TN panel that means
dramatically better viewing angles and
colors and you can even change white
balance to suit your preference now with
software so I guess that's it review
over the z2 is the z1 but with the big
glaring issue addressed
no no wait actually there's other stuff
to hold on also on the front we find a
two point two megapixel selfie camera
and what's this front-facing speakers
they're loud they sound good and most
importantly they're actually aiming the
sound at your ears
congratulations Sony Xperia z2 owners
you now get to join the club of cool
kids who don't watch videos in a mirror
to be able to hear what's going on on
the top we find a mic for active noise
cancellation and a waterproof open
headset jack on the left is a SIM and
charging port slot with that same cheesy
cover flap on the bottom is a wrist
strap loop and the main microphone then
on the right is a covered microSD slot
the lock button whose side position I
find perfect for larger phones like this
a volume rocker and a dedicated camera
button something I wish that more phones
had finally on the back is a twenty
point seven megapixel main camera and
one tone flash with a glass backing
material that's covered up by this
custom skin speaking of skins on to the
software Sony's skin hasn't changed a
whole bunch since the last time that I
used it they haven't really altered much
from stock Android either but there are
a few things I noticed
so first up messing with the way that
Google now works is not OK there's no
Google now from the lockscreen
and this is much more upsetting like LG
Sony has added extra crap to the Google
now swipe up this needs to stop I don't
want to be trying to voice control my
phone and end up on a shopping page for
recent songs changing gears I'm pleased
with the improvements they've made to
the keyboard I'd like to see vertical
resize ability like on the LG g3 because
I found the space bars position a little
low because of the phone's very small
chin bar but overall the correction was
good the keyboard was responsive and
this is the first time doing a phone
review I haven't bothered to switch to
Swift key in quite some time
highlighting text for copy-paste though
in certain places like Bach Roma dress
bar is now done by double tapping
instead of long pressing I'd probably
get used to it if it was everywhere but
here in Gmail it's long press instead so
that was kind of weird and threw me off
unlike the z1 skin which had a nice
little quick toggles cluster above you
vacations on the z2 Sony has moved them
to a separate quick setting screen like
everyone else and while they can be
customized some key stuff is missing
like a flashlight toggle so I needed to
install power toggles bummer
multitasking is the same as the old one
no so vertical scrolling with only three
items visible at a time they have that
in a favorites bar which is interesting
it lets you open small apps and widgets
has a little mini app I guess it's kind
of neat for quickly checking emails or
tweets but I didn't find myself using it
much speaking of apps app management
within the app tray is still excellent
icon rearranging feels snappier than
other devices I've used and the app tray
is boss with a search function a variety
of sorting options and a link to the
Play Store available by swiping in from
the left continuing to dig through the
menus and settings I wasn't too
impressed
I did find a super badass glove friendly
mode that works even if you have
something over your fingers but all in
all there's not too much customize
ability with only bare bones
accessibility and some hard-of-hearing
friendly stuff changing wallpapers and
the like there's actually just a single
lonely gesture control on the entire
phone although it is probably the one
that people are most likely to use this
one do the answer anyway so then I
checked out a submenu that I rarely
venture into and Sony got my attention
sound enhancement features normally
really turn me off and the Reaver being
surround presets fall into that category
but Sony does have a couple of things in
here that are actually worth turning on
dynamic normalizer increases the volume
of quiet stuff and reduces the volume of
loud stuff in your media library without
appreciably harming audio quality from
my time using it this is great if you
have a wide variety of tracks in your
music library at different volume levels
or if you have a particular youtuber you
like to watch whose video volume is
always too low and then the other one is
their equalizer it's hardly the most
comprehensive awesome software EQ ever
but it's free and better than nothing
which is what most player software has
and now that I've switched from power
amp to google play music for the
subscription service system-wide EQ was
really nice to have moving on to the
camera in the app low-light performance
didn't really blow me away with more
wastin I'd like and images taken indoors
but coming from the one n8 having image
stabilization even if it's digital was
great and being able to zoom thanks to
all them megapixels was nice as well
dedicated buttons for still and video
recording is a feature that should be in
every camera app and switching between
modes while a little unintuitive if
you're not familiar with the locations
of their icons is at least fairly fast
speaking of modes they range from I'd
use that all the time like 720p 120 fps
slow-motion with audio and 4k video
capture and a neat mode that lets you
take a picture first with the subject in
focus then with the background in focus
and adjust the perceived depth of field
to Wow I'd use that once for a laugh and
otherwise I wish Sony had spent their
time working on anything else like info
I which gives you information about like
landmarks and wine that you take
pictures of and this AR effect that lets
you put dinosaurs in your studio fish in
your backyard and silly masks on all of
your coworkers which leads us to the
conclusion over six months ago I
reviewed the Xperia z1 from Sony and
came away impressed by the phenomenal
battery life and better than anything
else I'd ever used haptic feedback and
all that whoops continued here
I even have 35 plus percent battery life
left at the end of the day and while I
didn't like the screen of the old one
that's been fixed along with some other
incremental improvements leaving me well
sad to say that this will be my last day
using the Xperia z2 as my daily driver
phone because it really is a fantastic
phone but Linus you might say this was a
really positive review of a phone that
appears to totally kick then is
dustproof and waterproof down to
actually being submerged to boot why
aren't you going to keep using it
because I'm giving it away dear and
generously or debrand I actually don't
know whatever they generously offered us
this custom skinned phone when they saw
me decline some requests on Twitter for
a video of the z2 because I couldn't get
a review unit with the catch being that
they wanted me to give away the custom
Linus tech tips wrapped phone
with a screen protector on it and a
matching wrapped box to one lucky viewer
