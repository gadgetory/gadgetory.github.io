here at the hoof who Institute at uni
STC to check out not just the life-sized
downing freethrow robot but also the one
and only badminton playing robot I'm
gonna see if my skills are up to snuff
here in just a moment we're gonna get
briefed on exactly how this thing was
built over the last several years and
see if man is obsolete just yet or if
we've still got some time left
thanks to video blocks for sponsoring
this episode
they're a great subscription-based
resource for downloading stock footage
video and more stay tuned for an awesome
offer from them later on in the video so
we haven't been briefed yet on how
exactly it works but it seems to have
something to do with these stereo
cameras in these base stations at the
end of the court cool so this robot is
not being used right now because there's
a lineup of people that want to use it
but I think I should be everyone's kind
of leaving okay yeah should be good
oh sure alright I guess I'm getting a
warm-up match okay so we're getting a
private demo now and we're starting with
them showing us the two robots playing
against each other completely robotic
badminton game okay so here's how the
base station works I was right these two
cameras here are for stereo computer
vision and I was actually wrong about
some other aspects of it so for example
I had thought that these right here
might be ultrasonic sensors that aided
these cameras in some way but no that's
not the case at all
so they're using two Baumer cameras
they're 2048 by 2048 resolution and they
run at a hundred and eighty frames per
second so according to the guys here
they manage as little as ten
milliseconds of delay between the
shuttle starting to move towards one of
the robots and it predicting
approximately where it's gonna land on
the court so here's how the gaming
starts right now it's very much in
prototype stages but the plan is
actually to turn these into a commercial
product and you can actually buy one
today if you want at the value price of
just about sixty five thousand US
dollars for the whole system so that's
the robot itself which runs for about 30
to 60 minutes on battery the Bay
station with the cameras that's powered
by it's either a Core i5 or a core i7
computer they weren't a hundred percent
sure and I don't know maybe they throw
in a racket for you at the same time
that one I'm not a hundred percent on so
at this point the robots aren't really
aiming at anything specific they're just
trying to
swak the bird kind of that away and then
it's up to the other robot to get in the
right spot so they haven't actually
measured the top speed that the robot
can travel on the court but from just
watching them you can see especially in
a case where one of them miss hits they
can actually get to where they need to
go really fast so they've got treads on
the bottom that allow the entire robot
to move on the port and then the racket
itself and the servo that's mounted to
it can also travel in both x and y axes
like a CNC as you can see ever since
that first glitch they've actually been
rallying with each other continuously
oh-ho and it's finally over you can see
it really went for it there though okay
okay it's my turn to play oh nice so you
can see the robot returns to Center
every time that puts it in the best
position to make the next shot although
I shouldn't say that the robot does it
so much as the control tower does it so
the robot itself
actually doesn't have any sensors at all
and it relies on the cameras to get
around on the court so they need to use
like a tracker pad at the beginning of
the setup process in order to help
measure the court as a calibration
process now in the future the plan is to
continue to develop it maybe give it the
ability to block a smash or give it the
ability to watch the player and use AI
to predictively decide what shot it
expects them to play
and then get ready for it proactively
look at it go all right let's make it
really move nice see that I hit the
ceiling but the robots still moved to a
location and made a swing that's because
what it does is it actually predicts
based on the first 10 milliseconds of
the shuttles movement where it's going
to go and then does its best to update
with more granularity as the shuttle
continues to fly but it will still take
that initial data move to where it
thinks it's gonna go and then use a
countdown timer calculation to make a
swing when it thinks it's going to
arrive so watch I'm gonna try and do
that again as long as I'm not smashing
too hard it can actually play back some
of my downward shots but it'll have to
wait until the Rockets angle can be
adjusted before it can do so with more
consistency now the original model that
they used to win the robotics contest
back in I think it was 2015 or 2016 when
the initial design was made had two
racquets one that hit this way and one
that hit vertically but what they found
as they continued to refine the design
was that it really just didn't make that
much of a difference at this level so
according to the students here the
condition of the shuttle shouldn't make
that much of a difference because of the
way that they're calculating it's likely
trajectory but I did notice the one that
I was using just now it missed twice
within a span of about 30 seconds so oh
not bad oh wow it actually want to point
on you there your turn okay hold on I
got a Oh gonna do this up shall I shower
this morning not showing us that doesn't
change that the easy rig is sweaty
this sucks what the heck I can't figure
out how to get you in focus did you hit
it out again robots gonna kick your ass
Dennis dude what this is like nerd
sports all over again so we're not at
the point yet where all humans can be
bested by robots but at least some of
them can and so I for one I'm gonna
prepare myself to welcome our robot
overlords and now a word from our
sponsor have you ever just really needed
