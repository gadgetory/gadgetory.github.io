entered in the Intel dynamic ticket
giveaway for a chance to win great
prizes is it Intel gaming promo com to
learn more so if you happened to look at
our unboxing of the g1 sniper 5 from
gigabyte their flagship of gaming LGA
1150 board and thought well I like that
but it's a little expensive it's a
little big I don't know if I need quite
all those features this is the board for
you my friends this is the g1 sniper m5
which is the micro ATX version slightly
fewer bells slightly fewer whistles same
gaming oriented features so when I say
gaming oriented features I'm talking
about things like better onboard audio
as well as Bigfoot e 20 200 killer Nick
on board so that prioritizes your gaming
packets as well as having some other
cool software features like limiting the
bandwidth available to certain programs
and stuff like that but at a lower cost
in a smaller form factor and without
some of the extras like the integrated
Wireless and Bluetooth card and stuff
like that so let's go ahead and run
through the accessories that are
included really quickly we've got an i/o
shield there you go looks a little
something like that conveniently labeled
we've got an sli bridge it's the
flexible sli bridge type and actually
that's kind of a unique layout for it
that's okay I'll talk more about the
slot layout after we've got to right
angle SATA cables and two straight SATA
cables so a smaller accessory package a
gigabyte sticker a manual a driver disk
download the latest off the gigabyte
website and this right here this is
where chiz starts to really get real
guys because when I say better onboard
audio I mean better onboard audio so
they're using sound Core 3d which is a
creative technology there's an audio
processor here under what is a gold
shield however it's sort of debatable
how much of a difference that's going to
make in terms of isolating it from EMI
but what's important is that it's on a
separated part of the PCB that actually
has a green line that draws a serious
business line between well here's the
audio stuff and here's everything else
so rather than having it on a riser card
still on the motherboard so you don't
use up a PCI Express slot which is
particularly important for an M ATX
board but that doesn't change the fact
that it's a very high-end audio solution
now this right here is upgradable op amp
kit op amp upgrade kit that's what they
call it sorry excuse me
so there is an op amp socket basically
what an op amp does is it amplifies the
audio signal this is important
particularly if you have high impedance
headphones that require a stronger
signal in order to drive them however
some people like to swap the op amps
because it can change the way that the
sound does the sound quality and when I
say quality I don't mean in terms of
goodness or badness I mean in terms of
the qualities of it the the color the
subtleties so it comes with a polar as
well as an additional different op amp
and you can upgrade to other different
aftermarket ones I'm not necessarily
saying that I think it's the best use of
your time and money but if you're one of
those people who wants to tinker and
wants to play with it gigabyte gives you
the choice so there you go we've got an
LGA 1150 socket right here supporting
the latest fourth generation has well
until Core i5 in I 3 and i7 processors
that means you've got full support for
high speed ddr3 memory running in dual
channel up to 32 gigs with the currently
available 8 gig dims that are on the
market we've got a high-end vrm solution
under a pretty straightforward cooling
solution that's got a gigabyte branding
as well as ultra durable branding on it
they are using what they're calling
their durable black solid cap so this is
part of their whole ultra durable 5
concept which includes better quality
components they're 2 ounce copper PCB
concept as well as their glass fabric
PCB which should in theory make the
board's more resistant to humidity which
might be more of a factor for people in
climates other than where I live but hey
it's good to have the features as
opposed to not having them there are
five fan ports on the board itself so
there's CPU as well as CPU optional many
people do use multi fan cooling
arrangements on their CPUs these days
and then down at the bottom you find an
additional two and then here where you'd
plug in a fan at the back of your case
you find an additional one your 8 pin
connectors in it's ideal location at the
top left and your 24 pin connectors in
its ideal location along
right you're onboard switches are up
here at the top right I like this better
than having them down at the bottom of
the board and the reason is that
particularly on an open test mention
honestly even in a case you start
installing graphics cards down here boom
all this is covered
having the Kinect having the front panel
connectors our front panel buttons up
here is more convenient so there is a
CMO switch so you can clear your CMOS
there's a reset switch there's a power
switch as well as a bios switch so there
are two dedicated BIOS chips on this
board and an LED indicator that tells
you which one you're using so there's a
main BIOS as well as a backup BIOS on
the board itself and then over here
we've got voltage read points which is
extremely handy if you want to get into
some extreme overclocking and you want
to be able to get more accurate numbers
than you can get out of the BIOS a post
indicator LED as well as a USB three
front panel header round out the right
side of the board with six SATA 3 six
gigabit per second connectors along the
bottom right edge this is enabled by
Intel's new chipset that finally has
lots of support for native USB 3 and
native say 2 3
very good Intel not too late on that one
anyway we've got our front panel
connectors here to front USB 2.0 ports
the audio which I talked about before as
well as if I could find it whatever I
can't find it anyway there's a killer e
20 200 Network chip on here somewhere
that handles that prioritized gaming
features and whatnot out of that Gigabit
Ethernet port right there two USB 2.0
ports four USB 3.0 ports and a ps2
keyboard mouse combo port round out the
usb on the back we've got a DVI port
HDMI another hdmi and displayport which
is a pretty complete complement of ports
back there as well as gold-plated 7.1
audio ports and an optical digital audio
port now I wanted to talk about those
PCI Express slots this one right here
and this one are wired up for 16 X or 8
X 8 X operation with this one wired up
for 4 X that means you're going to want
to carefully select your chassis if you
want to run a dual graphics card
configuration on this board particularly
SLI because SLI will not run in PCI
Express slots 1 &amp;amp; 3 because Nvidia
specify
you have to have at least PCIe 8x
operation this slot right here is
running off of the chipset not directly
off the CPU and it is running at 4x
speed so make sure whatever case you use
has an additional slot or an empty spot
nearby so that there's room for this one
to overhang if it's a dual slot card
which they pretty much all are these
